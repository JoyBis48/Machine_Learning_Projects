	<TEXT> Hm.. hard to pick just 1... I think that trader joes' dark chocolate peanut butter cups are darn delicious.  Their cookie butter dark chocolate bars are addicting too.  Then there's chocomize where you can add whatever.  I like their premade salty bar.  Kit kats are bomb, and so are almond snickers.  I'm hungry... can you tell? Hahahahah </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Henry Cavill.  We were at the Immortals premiere and I saw him take photos with female fans in the theater.  So I gathered up my courage, walked over, and asked if he would take a photo with me... Well he turned around, took a look at me, and said " oh they are going to start  the movie" then went back to chatting with the hot girls.  I guess my t-shirt, jeans, and glasses wasn't very cute :( *edited to remove typo </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No problem!  Here's a list of bonfires in southern california http://www.beachcalifornia.com/beach-bonfires-california.html .  I love doing beach days though it might get crowded in July.  No bonfires but Venice Beach is always fun.  Other fun stuff would be hiking to the Griffith Observatory http://www.yelp.com/biz/griffith-observatory-hike-los-angeles or http://www.yelp.com/biz/runyon-canyon-park-los-angeles-2 if you want to catch some celebrities.  Tons of girly stuff to do here in LA.  I hope you gals have a great time :D </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi!  Not sure what your exact budget is, but I would go to travelzoo or groupon and check out some of the deals they have for hotel or group activites.  Temecula (lots of wine tastings here) is only 90 minutes from LA so you can still party at a club on a day and checkout some orchards on another.  Another lower cost option would be hanging out at the beach for the day for a picnic/bbq and stay for a bonfire at night.  Cheap and fun!  Hope that helps :D </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Was touring a newly built 15 million dollar home while wearing a pair of booties over my shoes on a newly installed/waxed wooden spiral staircase.  My life flashed before my eyes as I started to bounce down the steps on my butt.  First thing I said when I stood up was "omg did I break the stairs?".  I did not want to pay to fix a staircase that was put into a home that expensive lol. </TEXT>
