	<TEXT> okay, here's one:

I grew up in a small small town in Massachusetts and the house that my family was living in at the time had a lot  of forest behind it. I wish I could tell you how much acreage-wise, but up until I was probably 17 I used walk through the woods back there and I never hit the small road that was on the other side.

So, one of my favorite things to do was go out during January/February after a couple of good snows had fallen. All the brambles and undergrowth had died out and you could follow animal tracks forever. Don't get me wrong, I'm not a good at tracking animals or anything, it was just fun to see what animals were running around out there. I was always looking for Bobcat tracks... but anyway, I digress.

I was probably 15 at the time, I had just gotten out of school and it was this time of year and not too cold. I started out, and chose to go a way out that I had been in the summer, but it had gotten too think to move any further. So I'm walking. and walking. for probably 45mins or so, perhaps a bit longer. I stopped for a moment to get my bearings, realizing that I'd never come this far in this direction. I look around a bit, and then take few more steps forward. And then slowly, I start to hear this music. Not complex at all, it sounded like a pipe or flute. The melody was very simple, five notes total, repeating in two phrases. I was scared... mostly because encountering anybody this far out in the woods could go bad. 

So I stood there. The music just kept going, steady and not relenting. I was too afraid to go anywhere closer, but I still just wanted to listen, to see if anything happened. Finally, after about fifteen minutes of listening, my fear got the best of me and I went home. 

I was pretty upset with my self the second I got home, so I decided that the next day after school I'd go back, retrace my steps and go see what was going on. I did, and there was absolutely nothing. No footprints in the snow, no houses, nothing. Just fresh powder underneath a pine grove. 

That is the weirdest thing that's happened in my life by far. I always went back to that place to try and figure out if there was any little cabins or homeless shacks in the area. Never found anything... kind of spooky.

TLDR, I heard some weird music in the middle of the woods.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> you know, I agree with this. But before everyone starts to shit on me, I'd just like to explain.

All feelings are valid, in that they are phenomenally there. But some feelings/responses can be misguided. For example,

"When you go out with your friends without me, I feel like you are avoiding me and that makes me think you don't value our relationship. It would make my life better if you took me out with your friends ALL THE TIME."

now of course this is an unhealthy statement. I'm not arguing that it's not. But these are legitimate feelings that are completely off base. (Specifically I know this, because it happened to me once upon a time.)

	<TEXT> It's strange, because I feel that you're the one trying to muddy the issue. I suppose it would be foolish to take this argument any further, because I can only see now that we will not reach a middle ground. 

just one thing:
it's about the fact that pornography is not a healthy basis for understanding sexuality from a biological angle and I think that 8 years old is to young to be taught about sexuality from an instructional angle.

You are upset, from what I've gathered, that he knew the distance between the holes. This seems strictly anatomical. But also remember that one hundred and fifty years ago, pinup girls would have been seen as hardcore porn, and a child seeing a girl's ankle would have been unhealthy. 

I'm not trying to muddy the issue, I'm trying to withdraw my feelings from a controversial subject in order to find some truth. It would appear that you cannot help but inject your feelings into it and conceal them as fact. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I mean, I honestly don't *feel* so good about it. But I'm not sure if there is really any inherent reason for this to be wrong.

For example, I would have no qualms about a 16 year old bringing an 8 year old to an art museum where there were nudes on display (painted, or otherwise). The line between what we deem as "smut" and tastefully done -- is in my mind -- nonexistent. 

Furthermore, and why I asked if you had a specific argument, is simply the question of how diegojones4 felt about the whole thing at the time. It seems like he was alright with it. And if that were the case, then quiet literally no one was harmed here.

 Is it that you feel sad because you had an innocence at that age that you would like to hold on to, and therefore it bothers you that someone else did not have that same innocence? If that's the case, then, yes spell it out. There's no reason to go on making moral arguments based on silly little feels.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As long as there were rules in place to prevent a pissing contest between candidate and fact-checker. It would have to be heavily moderated and have a clear format.

I would watch either way, really. The sad thing is that even with experts fact-checking in real time, people would still cling to partisan feelings and thus the debate would be spun based off of those inclinations. I have a feeling very little would be accomplished, it would just be a longer and more educational debate. But when it came down to it, people would hear what they wanted to hear and the experts would matter very little.

Actually, it would probably just prove to be a big shit show for the experts. Their careers would probably be under such scrutiny after trying to prove Mitt Romney or Barack Obama wrong that after the first one, no one would step up. </TEXT>
