	<TEXT> Were I was attacked by Freddy Krueger. You all know the movie right? Well I've watched it a million times and it's still never scared me (lets be honest who has it scarred?) and to be honest this dream was awesome!

So I was in the dream and he was in my kitchen, I grabbed a knife and tried to stab him, knowing it wouldn't work, I ran outside with him still chasing me. I met a girl I knew and he had been tormenting her too so I gave her the knife and said:

"Hurt yourself! Cut your arm, feet something!"

She said 

"Why?!"

And I replied

"If you can hurt yourself in the dream you'll wake up but just don't make it something that can kill you!"

So she did and all of a sudden she vanished so I picked up the knife and tried to hurt myself, Freddy still getting closer, but it wouldn't work no matter what I tried, the knife was like plastic now. Eventually he caught up and started suffocating me while laughing. I managed to get him off and ran for the hills. I don't remember much else but it was amazing!! (Because you know I love movies and the first nightmare and elm street is one i have a soft spot for). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks! I've never been addicted or anything but it was making me lazy and I was thinking things like all women fake orgasms. I know that's not true but when I do have sex it'll be with a girl I care about (at least 3-5 years from now, I don't want to have it too young). It will be much better than fapping. Anyway good luck to you :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I know most people do these on their tenth day but hell I'm in a great mood.

I've been studying more, playing less xbox but still enough for fun and of course I don't waste time fapping. I'm only 15 so obviously I'm a virgin which made me think:

"I don't know if I want to quit cause I won't have sex for years"

But it's worth it. It feels like I stopped yesterday and sure I've had alot of urges but this is fun and I'm already seeing some benefits!

Good luck to all of you out there. I'll leave some tips for those of you that feel like you can't make it.

* Say "YES" or "NO" to everything. Am I going to fap? NO! Am I going to study now instead of procrastinating? YES use this and it really helps.

* Use the 10-10-10 rule. If you fap now how will you feel in 10 minutes? In 10 hours? And if you quit nofap how will you feel in 10 years?

* A lot of men on here say they have trouble "finishing" during sex because of how much they've fapped, I'm only 15, like I said, but I don't want that to happen when I do have sex. Do you?

* Think of the fact that porn is just filmed prostitution. No one wanted to be a porn star as a kid. 

* If you want you can meditate, I do and it helps.

* I'm religious so that's a motivation for me.

* Think of the regret you'll feel later.

* don't try and stop urges just acknowledge them and then say ah well now I'm going to go and... (do something else, basically acknowledge it and move on)

Good luck guys/girls!! :D

	<TEXT> I'm 15, porn got me when I was 11/12. I was never addicted but I have a few ways to stop fapping when I think about it.

1. Think that porn is just filmed prostitution and that it is wrong 

2. Break questions down into yes or no. Should I fap, no. Should I do my homework now, yes. Should I...

3. Think about all the guys on here that say they can't cum when they have sex due to PMO. How horrible it would it be if you lose your virginity (if you haven't yet, I haven't and I don't want to for a few more years yet) and you can't "finish". 

4. Think about the 10-10-10 rule (yes I got that from another post). How will you feel in 10 minutes if you fap now? How will you feel in 10 hours? And how will you feel in 10 years if you quit nofap now?

Good luck :) oh and try not to thibk about porn or sex so much, I never really have but who knows everyone is different. When porn/fapping/sex comes to mind acknowledge it and then send it away and think about something else. (Meditation helps too, I've been doing it for a bit now and it's really nice). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> ...Filmed prostitution. Would you have sex with a prostitute? Would you watch someone else? That's all porn really is. It's disgusting (even if it doesn't seem like it when you watch). Think of this if you consider relapsing, you're about to be part of the reason that there is a demand for "filmed prostitution". Instead don't be, even if you, yes you, alone don't take part in it then you will know that. It might not make a difference, it won't make porn go away but at least you won't be part of the problem. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ha, ha my sister and her bf of 6 years recently had a kid, she's almost two. Anyway she asked "what's that?" Talking about her vagina when she was getting changed so my sister told her "that's your wee lady" (we're Scottish so imagine the accent). Then the next day she's naming and pointing at my body parts when she's visiting me. Eyes, nose, ears, mouth, hair, wee lady. I'm so happy I wasn't in public but I burst out laughing! :D </TEXT>
