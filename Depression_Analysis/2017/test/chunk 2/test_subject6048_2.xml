	<TEXT> I just finished "Stranger in a Strange Land". A popular science fiction novel from the sixties, this delves into a deep examination of what we value in a western culture, particularly in regards to religion and sexuality.

More importantly, this book is funny. There's humor enriched in all the pages, and makes reading it a genuinely enjoyable experience. 

After reading intense and complicated sci-fi, I chose this as a light option. I ended doing a serious examination about what my values are how people view things in western (especially American) society.

I'd suggest looking up some of the tremendous quotes from this book on a site like Goodreads, see if you find any intriguing, you may want to pick it up. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It took several moments for her words to register in his brain. The waves of adrenaline and euphoria hadn't finished passing over him. The knife...had he plunged it into a handbag my mistake? Certainly he felt the comforting sensation of cool metal sliding into that bloated sack of blood dangling off of her skeleton. Malcolm made efforts to maintain his natural steadfast, intimidating state, yet his face could not untwist itself from puzzlement.

"Take out the blade", she said softly. A whisper, drowned out by the wind as if not a  note had escaped her lips yet words he heard clear as crystal in his head. Her grey eyes piercing so deep into his own, it felt as if she was gazing at the entirety of his life.

Malcolm strained and sweated as he found himself gripping the chaffed, ribbed bronze hilt. Hot. More than hot, scalding. His eyes bulged with terror as he found himself tightly grasping and removing the scalding metal. Tendrils of smoke appeared above his hand. Nothing to hear but his heartbeat. Loud and hot. Nothing to see but her eyes. Grey and sharp. Drips of melted skin began to smack the pavement below.

The knife left her belly, a gaping wound left smoking, staring up at him.

"Now balance the scale", she commanded.

There was an instant, an instant after those words were uttered that he knew he was about to perish. An instant of complete terror, and a juvenile absence of any form of understanding. When that moment had passed the blade leapt from his fingertips and dug itself deep into his throat. Indeed, choosing this woman in particular to mug was a poor evaluation.

The woman stared down at the corpse, and drank in a deep gulp of icy, bloodfilled air, "I can't help but enjoy these moments", she mused. A faint grin crept along the side of her mouth. She decided to continue her stroll throughout the park. </TEXT>

Especially if OP is doing this as a hobby rather than trying to get by, he/she can probably afford a few free contracts. Doing VO's for student films doesn't seems like nearly as valuable a learning experience as actual professional work, and if it's as competitive as you say it is, quality and experienced professionals should have little trouble getting jobs over people like him.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The scene I'm referring to is where Mcnulty is sitting in his car drunk. He's on top of a hill, some kind of commotion happens at the bottom of it and causes a car alarm to go off. He gets out, shows his badge, and slips and slides down the hill because he's so hammered. Then proceeds to start laughing when he sees mud on his badge and the obvious metaphor.

Anyway, there's a oldie playing in his car, sung by a woman- can't for the life of me think of the song. Can't remember the episode or season or I'd try to find it myself. Hope I gave a decent description and one of you can help me out. Thanks all.

I always end up reading about these games when they initially show up, and are naturally surrounded by a lot of hype. "This is going to be a tremendous RPG just like it was in the glory days!".

Have any of you played these games? Been involved with development? Read about anything interesting as in do they live up to what they promise?

Going to some small classes is a great idea. I've almost exclusively done yoga by myself, and having an instructor critique me on my form would be quite valuable. I like the idea of exploring different poses and flows. I think I'm going to start with some sun salutations, and explore different variations of warrior, maybe triangle.

Try doing that in any profession or school of thought. All of these guys have great athletic talent- imagine the enormous process of evaluating all the other factors that will affect these people not just as football players but as men. If anything they're going to be wrong MOST of the time. Every pick is a gamble. Something you just have to accept. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 2011 week 14 against the Giants. At this point, both teams were in the hunt for the division. Basically the Giants were down 12 points with time expiring. They score their first touchdown. In order to have a shot at scoring their second, they need the Cowboys to go 3 and out on the next drive in order to leave enough time on the clock. On 3rd and long, Romo had a completely wide open Miles Austin who is just running with his hands up to Romo's right, around 15 yards down the field. Romo then lobs it about another 15 yards ahead of him into dead space. Giants go on to win the game. 

Personally I think Romo is a great QB that gets way too much shit- simply a product of being on the Cowboys. He dug himself into a hole early in his career by embracing his celebrity status, but I think at this point he's moved past it. This is a guy that made a 4th quarter comeback with a punctured lung and several broken ribs- someone like that will always have my respect.

	<TEXT> Bill Bryson has put out a lot of great work- I'd recommend browsing his other books online and seeing if anything catches your interest. This is assuming it's the style/voice he uses that made you like it so much.

As far as more on the topics of that book? Definitely A Brief History of Time by Stephen Hawking and Cosmos by Carl Sagan.

'A Short History of Nearly Everything' is a fantastic read, glad you enjoyed it. I read it a while back, and about a week ago bought the Audible version of it. Every time I hit the gym now I have this great british voice babbling to me about atoms and stardust. Highly recommend this for anyone looking for a great audio book, you can pick it up at any point in the narrative and immediately find things interesting. </TEXT>
