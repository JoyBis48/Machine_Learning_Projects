	<TEXT> the bible is a fairy tale, and the sooner more people see that, the better off we will all be. people created god in their own image, and people can kill him too.

you will not accept homosexuality because of the bible? a book that says the sun is fixed in the sky? and that the moon is a light source? 

i used to think the way you did, i grew up christian, and then i studied the bible and i saw the error of my ways and became an atheist.

When I was a child, I spoke and thought and reasoned as a child. But when I grew up, I put away childish things. - 1 Corinthians 13:11 </TEXT>

	<TEXT> yes, and which is why we say that you can discuss YOUR OWN DOSE as well as to state that we ARENT doctors.

every single one of us knows somebody who self-meds. some do because they didnt want to spend one more day as a gender they werent. some of us just had no access to a doctor who would prescribe them hormones. 

we are NOT against self-medding. we just ask that people not give out advice as if there were only one dose for everybody. there isnt. i'm not on spiro, or progesterone, only estrogen shots. one of my girlfriends is on shots too, but she takes them every week as opposed to every two weeks like me. my other partner is on spiro, estrogen, and progesterone, and she might add avodart to her regimen.

	<TEXT> i'm not a doctor, there is no such thing as a "standard dose" which part about those two things dont make sense? not everyone reacts to hormones in the same way, which is why we should ALWAYS see a doctor first.

yes, not all of us have access to a doctor. which is why we allow discussions about dosing AS LONG AS WE DONT SUGGEST THAT IT IS WHAT EVERYONE SHOULD DO.

i have two other trans girls living with me, and we are ALL on different prescriptions. it is the height of arrogance to assume that you know what the other person's correct dosage should be.

you're not alone, you never will be.

your answer means that you'd be happier as a girl, which means the answer to your question of whether or not to transition is "YES"

if you are trans, then the only option for us IS to transition. who can only find true happiness if we are in turn true to ourselves. living a lie will never achieve that. </TEXT>

my friends are my family now, although i'm not giving up hope that my fam fam will come around.

but you transition or not because you're trans, or not. not because of anyone else but you.

	<TEXT> every religious figure you can mention was a flawed human being.

Martin Luther  King was a serial adulterer, the FBIs monitoring of King  make up much of what we now know about the mans personal life. King had engaged in so many extramarital affairs that his wife, Coretta Scott King, had reportedly become disillusioned with their marriage.

Kings right-hand man, Ralph Abernathy, wrote in his 1989 autobiography that the staff all understood and believed in the biblical prohibition against sex outside marriage. It was just that he had a particularly difficult time with that temptation.

Billy Graham? Homophobic bigot. He considered homosexual behavior to be a "sinister form of perversion," a lifestyle choice that will lead gays to personal ruin. When a young woman wrote him about her sexual love for another woman in 1974, the evangelist replied with a threat: homosexual perverts will not inherit the kingdom of heaven. "Your affection for another of your own sex is misdirected and will be judged by God's holy standards," he answered.

Mahatma Gandhi? He had unusual personal practices (which included, alongside his famed chastity, sleeping naked next to nubile, naked women to test his restraint.) The pre-independence prime minister of the Indian state of Travancore called him, "a most dangerous, semi-repressed sex maniac"

	<TEXT> before i came out, i crossdressed pretty much only to fap too. i was turned on by wearing all the sexy lingerie. then i decided to go out en femme one halloween, i found the frilliest outfit to wear, and i was TERRIFIED of going out like that because i was scared i was going to have a raging boner the whole time thru. once i walked thru that door(took me about half an hour to work up the courage), i was just HAPPY to be dressed as a girl. i loved the feeling of the air swishing past my thighs. 

and once i started hrt, even the morning wood went away. i still love dressing up in sexy lingerie, but only because it makes me feel super sexy. i blame testosterone poisoning, "here, let me take a simple situation AND SEXUALIZE IT TO THE MAX"

	<TEXT> actually, no, because the medical descion of what can and cannot be done rests with the individual, in this case, the mother. you cannot force anyone to have or not have a medical procedure they do or do not want to have. so you cannot force a jehovah's witness to receive a blood transfusion even if it to save their life. you cannot remove viable organs from a recently deceased person, even if it is to save another person's life, because even dead bodies have certain rights. the right to have an abortion lies solely with the mother. end of story. </TEXT>

as for the height? have you scrolled thru /r/tall? you're one of the shorter girls there. i'm 5'11" and i rock 5 inch heels all the time. (size 9.5 shoe)

who knew that tall girls have big feet? /s

took me a year before i finally saw a girl staring back at me in the mirror.

and listen, your mom can call you a jabberwocky for all that it matters, it doesnt make it true. you know you're a girl, nothing on this plane of existence or beyond can change that fact.

that's the pesky thing about facts, they're true whether people choose to believe in them or not.

you're a girl. simple as that. </TEXT>

also, if your service is mandatory like israel, singapore, taiwan, south korea etc, there's usually an exemption for trans people.

do you want to talk about it? i could prolly find the regulation on service exemption if you tell me what country you're from

	<TEXT> From the WPATH Standards of Care

A mental health screening and/or assessment is needed for referral to hormonal
and surgical treatments for gender dysphoria. In contrast, psychotherapyalthough highly
recommendedis not a requirement. 

The SOC do not recommend a minimum number of psychotherapy sessions prior to hormone
therapy or surgery. The reasons for this are multifaceted (Lev, 2009). First, a minimum number of
sessions tends to be construed as a hurdle, which discourages the genuine opportunity for personal
growth. Second, mental health professionals can offer important support to clients throughout
all phases of exploration of gender identity, gender expression, and possible transitionnot just
prior to any possible medical interventions. Third, clients and their psychotherapists differ in their
abilities to attain similar goals in a specified time period.

And RLE is only require for GCS,  not HRT

From the WPATH SoC:

The current Board of Directors of the WPATH herewith expresses its conviction that sex (gender) reassignment, properly indicated and performed as provided by the Standards of Care, has proven to be beneficial and effective in the treatment of individuals with transsexualism, gender identity disorder, and/or gender dysphoria. Sex reassignment plays an undisputed role in contributing toward favorable outcomes, and comprises Real Life Experience, legal name and sex change on identity documents, as well as medically necessary hormone treatment, counseling, psychotherapy, and other medical procedures. Genital reconstruction is not required for social gender recognition, and such surgery should not be a prerequisite for document or record changes; the Real Life Experience component of the transition process is crucial to psychological adjustment, and is usually completed prior to any genital reconstruction, when appropriate for the patient, according to the WPATH Standards of Care. Changes to documentation are important aids to social functioning, and are a necessary component of the pre-surgical process; delay of document changes may have a deleterious impact on a patient's social integration and personal safety.

family was the hardest, my parents didnt take it too well, nor my religious aunt and cousin. i have a really big fam fam, and only two of my cousins talk to me right now. 

my friends are my family now. i honestly thought i'd have to go thru transition by myself, and my friends made me cry because not only did they support me, but they wanted to come along for the ride. and that made me smile inside, even tho i was bawling my eyes out like a baby.

it's been a blast, and i dont regret it one bit. </TEXT>
