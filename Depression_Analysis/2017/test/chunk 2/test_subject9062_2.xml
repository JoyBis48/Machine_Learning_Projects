	<TEXT> MUSKEGON TOWNSHIP, MI --  The 27-year-old Muskegon Township man who was nearly naked and reportedly high on acid when he allegedly discharged his gun outside a pizza business on Saturday, with three kids in tow, has been arraigned on four misdemeanor charges.

...


Engle had three children with him  ages 6, 4 and 3  when police said he stood outside the pizza business wearing only a towel and pounding on the glass windows of the business until one shattered. His .40 caliber semi-automatic handgun went off in the process, damaging the casing on the business door. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I remember the anti-poverty campaigns of the 70's and early 80's. And it seems our poverty problem is much worse this time around - it's going to take a massive shift in the perception of public opinion. But I'd argue the true public opinion is to help thy neighbor. It's just when people are manipulated into thinking that fixing the poverty problem is somehow giving people a free lotto ticket. It's just a fucked marketing campaign of the Paul Ryan austerity types, sitting pretty and calling out hate speech against the worst-off among us.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As we saw in the Santa Barbara massacre, the parents tried to warn cops but they needed access to his home. Now, a law is being passed so that concern IS the justifiable cause. This may help. 

I always hear that people don't want laws because law abiding citizens follow them and criminals don't. However, if we make selling a handgun without a background check illegal, all that does is put the good guys on notice to run background checks to ensure they aren't selling to a bad guy - which happens! Felons buy guns without background checks right now. One way or another we need that to end. If a GGWAG is selling in a private transaction and runs a background check and the buyer is a felon, the GGWAG has just potentially saved lives. I'll never get why someone who is supposedly a good guy gun owner would be against that.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's come out that the majority of mass shootings have been done by people who have illegally obtained guns. It seems to ME that anyone pro-gun with half a brain would agree that background checks and registration would make their own gun ownership safer and more protected, because it could stop many of these massacres that make so many people afraid of gun owners. What's your take on this? Why not require background checks and registration of every firearm? </TEXT>
