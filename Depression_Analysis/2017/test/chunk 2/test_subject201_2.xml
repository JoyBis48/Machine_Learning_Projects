	<TEXT> why yes they are! But I am more interested in seeing a (self propelled)  mortar launch out of a rocket in mid flight and also address the challenge of making it successful. What I think may happen is once the mortars launch out of the rocket, the rocket and the mortar will push against each other and just push apart, making the mortar go up a bit more and the empty rocket shaft go down. Kinda like repelling magnets in zero gravity. Also this is just a first draft of simply an idea. I thought it would be cool. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I still have a lot of kinks to work out. This is pretty much a first draft of a cool idea I had, so not much effort went into the physics of it yet. Thank you for your concern for my safety. I already play it very safe and you are very right about a fail to lift scenario. That would really suck but I would treat it like you said, as a loaded gun. Maybe I will even go as far as launching it from inside my jeep and film it instead of standing next to it just in case.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Its nice to hear some support! Everyone is like... bad idea, illegal, wont work. Like I said, this is just an idea I thought to draw out so I wouldn't forget. I wasn't really planing on making it but now I want to make this or something similar . So far I have some great ideas for how to make it work and work safely. Also yes, it wouldn't really matter if the mortars ejected properly (especially at night) because the main goal is to just get the mortars up in the air with fuse lit, so wasn't really planning on being able to recover a (still in one piece) rocket. Even though that would be nice. I will make a video when I get the time to make this happen! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks for your words of wisdom. This was just an idea I drew up one boring night. I've posted a lot of these ideas but for some reason this got a lot more attention maybe because of some controversy. But I pride myself on being safe and I probably wont end up making this. If I do something like it in the future I will think of your words. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is just a glimpse into my twisted mind. Probably not something I would carry through with for a few reasons. Not sure if its legal and its defiantly dangerous. And yes I would need to do some real world calculations when it comes to weight and other factors. This is just a concept I though would be cool. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We've already talked talked to our vet and they said it would  be fine to breed her with a small stud. she is an english jack and normal is between 9 to 14 pounds so she is in the norm. We also have a 13 pound female but prefer the temperament and looks of the 10 pound. We plan to keep most of the puppies ourselves and only give a couple to close friends that we know would have time and the love they need. If they need round the clock nursing there is not a problem, I am home all the time and if I go out my wife is home. we don't leave our dogs unattended. and yes the vet would do shots, tail docking and dew claws and any other care they may need from a professional. We did a lot of research be fore we bought our dogs the ten pound is 3 years  old and the 13 is 2.  The breeder we got them from is no longer breeding and we would like to have more like her. we have looked for other breeders for english jacks but they are not very common where we are. we have thought a lot about this and would not do anything to harm either of our babies. I hope this answer all of your questions. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have a 10lb female English Jack Russell Terrier. She is a pretty small Jack and me and my wife are looking to breed her. We live in Maine and are looking for a Stud but we want to find a small male because we are worried about her small size and that the pregnancy will hurt her. Does anybody have any advice on breeding small dogs and or know of any place to find a small English Jack Russell stud? </TEXT>
