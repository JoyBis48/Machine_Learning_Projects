	<TEXT> A few things as a manager for a quick service place (and of course past worker):

Don't let this get you down. Yes, it's mcdonalds but everyone has their struggles and although you may not feel anyone else will hire you, they will. You have something to bring to the table, whether you know it or isn't visible yet.

You supervisor shouldn't make you feel angry or upset. It's his job to LEAD you. Leadership is about bringing out the best in people and helping them towards their goals and growing.

If you're not happy, I'd say quit. I know this isn't always possible because of financial situations but sometimes you just have to go with your gut.

Also, I kind of skimmed this post, but I hope you realize there will always be hardships in life and in a career and need to be able to cope and reorganize yourself to work through these issues. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't eat meat so I'm probably not the best person to ask. What dish is served with these options? Chicken is probably the healthiest, and if I ate meat, I'd only eat chicken or turkey. Lean meat, great protein, plus all the chickens in the world are only alive due to human breeding for dietary purposes, so if you're worried about what is humane, don't worry -- we already ruined the species and I don't think they can become extinct anymore. </TEXT>
