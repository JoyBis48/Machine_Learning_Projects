	<TEXT> So our government has lied to us again. This time (and its not the first) it has come from the very top, the man everyone put their hope and beliefs in turns out too be a fucking asshole who doesnt give a fuck about any of you, your rights, your freedom, your very existence as a human being. This administration does not give a fuck about any of you, or anyone else in the world apparently. 

The last one didnt either when they sent your sons and daughters to death on bullshit information that they knew was a lie, when they enacted so called laws and rules that deny you the things granted by the supreme law of the land. And what did we do. Not a fucking thing. 

Also lets not forget the entire system is corrupt, "oh what about so and so from that one state, he/she is trying to make a difference they are trying to right these wrongs." Bullshit and fuck you. If you think for one second these so called "Politicians" give a fuck about you, you are completely misguided and ignorant of how the system works. 

"Oh well what should we do? Random guy on the internet what CAN we do?" Well lets see we could protest and have the media paint us as rapist/drug users/idiots who dont know what they want. We could vote (in a system that is broken) for people who will make changes and fix the problem (remember how hard reddit was dick riding for Obama when he came here.) We could show our civil disobedience and take to the streets as a mob. (Yeah and when the police come with the guns,gas,armored tanks,grenades,clubs,chemical weapons and the feeling that they know they will get away with anything they do. Be prepared to either give up or get killed because they were "in fear of there lives.") Well we could gather on our computers and come up with something (NSFuckingA).

The point too all this is we have very few options left for us. The system has been working toward a goal for years and years and a bunch of post on the internet isn't going to change anything. 

The founders of this country shed blood for the beliefs and ideas that once made this the greatest country on earth. Sons, brothers, husbands, went too die for us we can sit around and be the best keyboard activist we could be. And you know what  I have no answers, I have no idea, I have no plan to fix what is broken. Im just as lost as you. Just another twenty-seven year old father who sees the entire country heading toward something that's either completely safe and sound that leads to us giving away everything that we as a nation are founded on. Or something bloody, violent, unsafe and scary that leads us back to when the people where in charge. Not some rich asshole in a suit or some idiot in a suit controlled by money.

	<TEXT> Anime can be a bit hard to get into, with that said I'm gonna list some of my favorites with a small summary and you can check out which one if any sounds enticing. 

Cowboy BeBop - considered to be the best anime ever made it focuses on a group of bounty hunters in space and there various adventures. Each episode is pretty much self contained but there is a plot line of each character that by the end is wrapped up fully and very well done. Check out the episode Pierrot Le Fou.

Afro samurai - the story focuses on afro as he kills and kills some more too reach the man who killed his father infront of him as a child. Full of action, violence, revenge, some feels and a sound track by RZA def check it out.

Samurai Champloo - the story of a girl who hires two samurai to help her find the samurai who smells of sunflowers, its full of style, action, comedy and imo on par with bebop as one of the greats. 

Panty and Stocking - made by the people who made KLK story is about two angels. Panty (a foul mouth nyphomaniac) and Stocking (a goth girl who loves sweets) who must kill ghost to collect coins to get back into heaven. This one is a non stop ride of comedy, pop culture refrences, stylised violence, and absurd fun. It doesn't take its self seriously and its better for it.

Paranoia Agent - Do you like trippy mind fucks because that's what it is. A town is terrorized by Lil Slugger a kid on roller blades who attacks people with a baseball bat. Good style, good story a d kinda weird but totes worth it.

Trigun - A wild west type anime, focuses on Vash the Stampede in his travels fighting off bounty hunters, over the top villians and two insurance girls, too find Peace And Love. But in all seriousness its a great series loved by most for good reason. 

When they cry - don't let the cute girls fool you this shit gets dark, like real dark. The story is split up into a few diffrent storys each containing a few episodes. Full of curses, tourtue, violence, some feels. Its not a trip for the faint of heart.

FLCL - zany, over the top, weird, stylish and a lot more. I could say more but its only six episodes go watch it.

Lain - a story of girl and her computer. There's way more to it than that but this is one of those ones where you watch it and you go wtf then you watch it again and go. Ooooh. Mind fuckey and very good imo. BUT YOU DONT SEEM TO UNDERSTAND.

Those are just a few I personally enjoy and feel like give my half assed summery for. Some others I enjoy are, 

Evangellian
Which hunter robin
Ergo proxy
Elfin lied
Dbz
FMA Brotherhood
Is this a zombie
Highschool of the dead
Monster
Hellsing
Blood
Welcome to the NHK

Hope at lease one catches your eye good luck and enjoy. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm a 26 year old single father of a 2 year old daughter whom ive had on my own since day one. I have no ties to her mother (she payes no child support, only sees Aya once every few months, no fighting, no anything), I live in a single bedroom apartment with my daughter, shes has the room I have the living room. I work everyday  im fairly attractive, im sharp as a tack, and im pretty layed back drama free guy, and I havnt been in a relationship  since her mother (and that was a mess).

Honestly at this point I know that i'm alone. Ive accepted this. At a certain point you just kinda let go, and stop trying to reach out for "her" and instead focus on giving your child the love that you wish you could feel. 

TLDR: In my experience as a single dad you are less desirable. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Single dad here, heres a quick story.

Daughter is born, her mother isnt stable enough too be a mother, and she doesnt even want too. (shes told me I chose too not give her up for adoption so she is MY problem) So I moved back home to my moms and take care of my daughter on my own. Around my daughter being 6 months I get a call from the Child Support Agency in Columbus. (i live in ohio and in the county next to columbus) They told me too come in so we can set up ME paying child support. I go in with Aya (my daughter) and with notes from witnesses (doctors, friends, family, boss, co workers) saying Ive done everything without any help from her mom.

Oh well in that case we will close the case against you and we will have your county pick up the case against her. 

Aya is almost two years old now. Ive still never herd anything about awarding custody or having her mom pay anything. The system is very flawed and biased. 

I think its just so fucked that within 6 months I was told to come in to set up payments, but its been almost two years and she is basically not doing anything and is getting away with it. </TEXT>
