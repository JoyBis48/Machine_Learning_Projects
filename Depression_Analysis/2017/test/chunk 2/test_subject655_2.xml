	<TEXT> From Washington here.... 

I really appreciate you saying this and hope more people read it.   We've got people (mostly young men) showing up to live in washington.   They don't get that it's supposed to be laid back and chill.   

Great... you wanna partake in the legal weed I'm fine with that... but you don't need to stand out on the fucking sidewalk with a 6 foot triple matrix bong and blasting bob marley at 9 am.   

I get it...you're stoked to be here.  But can't you just like roll a spliff and chill on your porch or whatever?   

Edit:  On a side note, if you do this the cops WILL bust you.  You don't have to worry about getting beat down for a roach is all.  Doesn't mean its a hot box all of seattle time.    </TEXT>

2. To be fair, internet, modern postal service, and the likes aren't really able to be used to deprive people of life.  

3. Yes... they wrote it exactly for that, I already said that more than once. except most of the threats at the time were bands of indians, and military units (both rogue units and enemy units).

	<TEXT> Why?  Each amendment stands alone.   The wording of any other amendment has no bearing on the 2nd amendment.    

It clearly says "well regulated militia"   

That does [not] mean to our forefathers that people need assault rifles with shitloads of rounds in them.   There was no such thing as a machine gun when it was originally written.   To them. a firearm was slow... heavy... and not very deadly in a singular form.  It wasn't until entire miitary units, firing muskets together as one, that they became effective in bringing death.  

So you have to think... they didn't write the amendment with the idea in mind that one weapon in the future could kill far more people than 50 men firing muskets could.  They wrote it with the idea that communities could defend themselves without waiting for a military unit that could be weeks away (or never coming).  The idea was that public communities would own and regulate the weapons use... rather than allowing single individuals to build stockpiles of powerful weapons that were in no way managed by anyone other than that individual.   The forefathers were VERY MUCH about preventing any ONE MAN from holding too much power, but that MANY MEN TOGETHER (the people or the public) would hold the power.      </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I always thought the 2nd amendment wording was strange.   To me it reads not as a right for every man to have a gun, but was the right for a civilian population to organize into a well regulated militia and stockpile arms for that militia.   

The supreme court had other ideas I guess.  

Edit: I'm not saying the supreme court is wrong in their interpretation.  I just think the original wording indicated a little bit more organization to owning weapons than simply straight up no checks or balance of power between individuals.    I don't think they wanted the GUNS GUNS GUNS dystopia the NRA (and their arms dealers support) would prefer having.    I say this as both a gun owner and member of the NRA. (which was a very different NRA when I joined) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You're not buying a 2 year agreement when you buy a non carrier phone.   

And you don't have bloatware.  

You know why bloatware companies pay to reduce the cost of the phone?   It doesn't matter if you don't use their software.  They still make profit off the data the software on the phone is allowed to acccess.  

So no...it's not FREE.  They FORCE you to give them something.   And you don't even get a device you fully control in exchange or the freedom to change carriers with that phone once you're agreement is done.   So you don't own it.... you paid verizon to own your phone for you and tell you what you can and cannot do with it. And in this case... the carriers are telling people that their devices must not be secure. 

That's a big fucking expensive problem.


The money you save from not being locked into a contract alone is enough to cover the subsidized nonsense.   Before I quit that I couldn't get new phones.  Now, I pay my full price phones down in 6 to 8 months (sometimes less) and get an upgrade.   And my monthly bills for phone service have been about half on account of the buying power I gained from freedom.

	<TEXT> I'm in Southern Leyte Philippines.  Woman comes to me asking what she should do.  Woman is in her mid 50's and obese 

The wound was full of green and yellow puss before I washed it out with a bottle of saline from a first aid field kit.  

It took a good hour and half to get all the crap out of it.  I expected it to look a lot worse before I began cleaning the gunk off but here it is clean: 
http://i.imgur.com/fUN36HG.jpg

She says the wound is from Cellulosis.  She had this hole in her back for 4 or 5 weeks before visiting a doctor; who upon seeing the injury administered to her a pneumococcal vaccination as treatment.  Seems odd to me but I'm no doc so...  

(In a seperate case, this doctor gave a diagnosis of "weak lungs" to a 5 year old boy and placed him on anti-tuberculosis medication.  The boy was not recovering and during a visit to the emergency room was diagnosed and treated for pneumonia.  He recovered quickly at that point)

Back to the woman... After her vaccination she then came down with high fever and was generally unwell but managed to recover after 2 weeks of illness before coming to me.   

This is the wound now at 7 weeks old.   Is this something that needs to be stitched closed?  Do I need to transport her 8 hours away to the big hospital?  I don't really know what I'm doing... or how to bandage anything properly.  I just made a flat square of guaze and tape to keep it covered.  But I'm afraid the guaze will stick inside... eek.   

This is why I work Logistics.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You misunderstood.  The wave is not pushing it back and forth.   The point of convergence between the two interstellar medium and solar wind is what changes; moving past voyager while voyager maintains is heading.  

This turbulent nature of the convergence of the two mediums is the most commonly expressed reason here.     


THe water and air simulation is just to visually represent the fluid dynamics that happens at the convergence point where the two separate mediums collide.    What the simulation shows is that the border between the two is turbulent and not just some instant border change. 

THAT'S IT.  It never LEFT as the media expressed it.  It just explains WHY the readings are occurring(and being misreported) while it passes through the convergence point.   

If you're going to refute a point, try not to change it entirely from what it is first.  Trying to act like I was saying it pushes voyager back and forth.... LOL   Never once did I say it was exiting and re-entering.  I only referred to its time spent in the turbulent convergence zone of the two mediums.

	<TEXT> True.  But the LOSS occurs from being locked into 2 year agreements and not being able to shift carriers as desired to take advantage of promotions.  

Also, the alternatives to subsidized (like edge) come with a huge hidden interest cost where the user pays MORE for the phone than it's regular cost than they would if they just utilized the interest rate on a credit card.   (not to mention the payment flexibility)

And then there is the added loss of dealing with problems caused by purchasing a locked down device that has bloatware on it and you're stuck with a broken device.  Sometimes the bloatware causes such huge problems with battery life the phone has to be replaced.   Again... time lost and time is money.  

If you are unable to afford a phone without selling your soul to a phone company for 2 years (or paying HUGE early upgrade fees) then you should not be purchasing a premium phone.   

The subsidized phones do two things.  Make 3rd parties free money and imprison customers to their carrier.   That's it.  (3 things if you count not being able to be fixed at home) 

Its much cheaper to buy it through credit card.  *And also many non carrier phone dealers will have payment plans on premium unlocked phones.*  Many of these dealers will forgive credit problems with a small downpayment.  Also, waiting to buy 4 or 5 months after release is a good way to get refurbished phones that are in brand new condition for a fraction of the cost.   </TEXT>

Its wrong in showing how fluid dynamics work in a turbulent shockwave?  Uhhh no.  It was something shown at a Nye and Tyson talk to kids to get them to understand about theories behind how the shockwave works.   The water represents the interstellar medium of space.  The air blowing outwards represents the solar wind pushing it back.   

Is it EXACTLY what happens?   NO..... duh.   but it is good at showing some of the laws behind how it works.

	<TEXT> Why would that be the answer?   

The answer should be to find out if she is cheating using less intrusive means.  It's not hard to figure out someone is cheating.  It's as simple as "i have to work today" when you really dont.   

The ends do not justify the means even if the ends justify an action be taken.   Two wrongs don't make a right.  Neither person here had any respect for the other.  So fucking break up and hopefully they'll both learn not to be dickheads in the future.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Elsewhere in this subreddit is a whole discussion w/sources where they say they can.   

The police can just hook a device up to phones older than 8 or 12 months and unlock them because most have exploits by that age.  

The only ones they have to send to apple are new ones of which they get partial data from.  after about 8 or 9 months, exploits are developed and the police update their little tool. 


They don't need shit to get you data.  So it doesn't matter if you do fingerprint or iris or pin code... or what your legal protections are for them physically forcing you to unlock the phone.... it.... doesn't....matter.   They have your data if they want it.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> People STOP BUYING SUBSIDIZED PHONES!   

All you get is a 2 year pain in the ass agreement that you can never be free from if you want to afford the upgrade.  

just buy the unlocked version on a credit card and pay it down in 4 months.   If you STILL can't afford it, then you should be doing something with your money other than buying a premium phone.  

There's a lot of places selling unlocked devices that offer financing too.    </TEXT>

	<TEXT> its because of the code it changes within the system processes or configuration files to allow itself.  Even if you remove the app, the separate code is there there able to be accessed.  

Now if the carriers didn't lock people's bootloaders down, everyone would have had a custom recovery installed and flashed a clean rom by now.  But once again all this hold handing the carriers do to "protect users" has actually put them at greater risk.   

And because the carriers have a real dick up their ass about letting manufacturers keep their devices up to date, a patch to fix it is just kicking it on the shelf at samsung.  Meanwhile the carrier just lets all their users phones shit the bed.   

We need the FTC to step in and say enough is enough.  Get the carrier out of the way.  All it needs to do is connect my call.  There is NOTHING about the software on the phone that will fuck that up.  The ONLY approval they should have over updates is when the update is to the radio.  But what's funny is, they don't even need to do that because unlocked users flash those all the time with no problems.  

There has not been a single case of modified phone software harming the network.  On the other hand, there seems be a shitload of locked down phones harming users going on.    </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You're on the exynos though... the article only lists the American carrier models as the ones at risk.  The international carrier free phones did not come with swiftkey.  Only samsung and google. (my 910c only came w/samsung)  swiftkey is different.  Swiftkey made a special bloatware version specifically for carrier model samsung phones.   This bloatware ended up being a bloated sack of ever expanding shitdemon. 

People, If you're on a carrier phone, and you were required to get it contracted to afford it... STOP DOING THAT!  Buy the unlocked versions only. Better to put it on a credit card and pay it down over 3 or 4 months than to get locked into a 2 year aggreement and no control over your own shit.    Don't let the carriers do this shit anymore.  People don't want bloatware for a good fucking reason and this is the biggest fucking one.    </TEXT>

If you observe the edges of this indentation expanded and shrink rapidly.  

The edge of the termination shock is sort of doing the same thing... which is where voyager is. It's not leaving just returning readings of the turbulent convergence point of the two medium of interstellar space and solar wind.     

It is caught in the turbulence of the edge.

No matter how long it's been.... it'll always be there.  In the back of your mind.    You can't unlearn it.   

You could spend 40 years afterwards in a completely blissful marriage.  And if the cheater were to go alone into a room with another female... or drive with one in his car... Or on his walk you see him wave hello to the lady down the street and she returns his greeting with a big sloppy tongue kiss....   you'd wonder.  and if you say you wouldn't you're a damn liar or a fool.   


Edit: All kidding aside. you'd still wonder even if all the actions were innocent.  You'd still wonder if you need to wonder.  Past experience guides future behavior.  You really don't just undo betrayal.

	<TEXT> Uh yes he was.  He created a whole type of warfare called ["hard war"](http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/11/17/rethinking-shermans-march/?_r=0) that involved starving civilians to death and shelling innocent towns.  

He stripped the civilian population of food on his march... even though he had more food than his soldiers could consume.  They'd take it anyway.   

The only people he did not kill were the one's that got out of his way and allowed him to brutalize others.  If you resisted at all, say to protect your last remaining cow, you and your whole family were dead.  

So it's often said "Sherman's March did not include mass killings"   That's true.  Instead, they were precision targeted killings.  Personal vendetta killings.  A die in a fire killings.   Killings of the most desperate who's backs were against the wall.

Ultimately, [his idea of war](http://www.historynet.com/general-william-tecumseh-sherman) was to make innocent civilians suffer as much as possible before they died.  

Also, Sherman seeded the term, "The only good indian is a dead indian" as a shortened version of his original words ""The only good Indians I ever saw were dead."   

So yeah... he loved killing.  And he loved it to be close and personal.   [And he loved inflicting as much hardship and pain as possible before doing so. Because his desire was to "make them howl."](http://www.history.com/topics/american-civil-war/shermans-march)  </TEXT>
