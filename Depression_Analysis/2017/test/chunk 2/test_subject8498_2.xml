	<TEXT>  You're saying that people who experienced unwanted sexual contact weren't raped because three decades later they don't roll into the fetal position and cry any time a joke is made that vaguely resembles their trauma.

Yeah, no. I'm pretty sure that's real fucking far from what I said.

16 is when you get your G1... sure you need someone in the car with you but you can drive one.. and there is no legal age limit on how old someone has to be to own a house.. a 2 year old could own a house if their parents put it in their name.

None of those things are legal here (Argentina). </TEXT>

Then I thought that maybe my S4 Mini had a IR transmitter, and searched for an app. Found one, installed it, and thought "this won't work, I'm sure". Great was my surprise when it actually worked PERFECTLY! I now have a remote IR shooter on my smartphone. I should've realised earlier, but well. Maybe my post helps someone in a similar situation, it's super useful and pretty cool as well. </TEXT>

Depression kicks A LOT stronger when you aren't completely sober. As this commenter says, stay it for a while. Keeping active, forcing yourself to go out and do activities helps a lot. It's hard at first but it does help.
   
I started meditating a few days ago and I'm really enjoying it, so I recommend you OP check it out too. I don't know if it's for everybody, but I did think it wasn't for me, and I'm glad I was wrong. Look it up, it's super simple, and it may help you calm down and stay more focused.

	<TEXT> So, I've been having some issues lately that gave me some panic attacks and constant fear, and last night my fear "peaked" and I was very paranoid about very very stupid things.    

I've been thinking about meditating for some time now, and lurked this subreddit and read a bunch of the top posts to get good info on how to do it. I started today, feeling very down, seeing very desaturated colors, and with some fear still in my heart.   

I sat in a towel, with my legs crossed, and the tip of my thumbs touching (I did as described on the #1 top post here). I concentrated on my breathing after puting the alarm for 10 minutes, and started focusing. At first, lots of thoughts came by, that meditation wasn't for me, that it will accomplish nothing, etc etc, but as I read, I contemplated the thoughts and let them flow and pass by.       
          
Later, I began to relax, and to feel good. I could see my problems with a lot of perspective, and they started to feel very solvable. This brought a smile and a feeling of happiness. Over the course of those 10 minutes, I relaxed and reached a very clear mental status. I'm now totally and utterly astonished about my experience. It served me in a great deal, and although I know this is the first step of many, just doing it makes me feel great.

I look foward to do this again tomorrow, and the day after that. And the day after that as well. I have a trip in 2 weeks, in which I'm hoping to practice this as well.          

It was beautiful and very helpful, and I wished to share that with you. Of course any tips or advice are very well welcomed.  
   
Thanks for reading :) </TEXT>
