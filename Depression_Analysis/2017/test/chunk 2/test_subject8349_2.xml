	<TEXT> I didn't win the "genetic lottery" at all. I have dark brown eyes, black hair, big nose, big lips considering that I'm white (or at least I think I am), wide teeth that have gone yellow-ish even though I never had teeth problems and always washed them, and tanned skin. I would love to have light blue eyes, small nose, normal-sized lips, normal white teeth and fair skin. The only thing I like is being tall, actually. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No. There are no real movies in 4k yet, many TV channels still broadcast in 720p and the price of a 4k TV is ridiculous. By the time 4k gets popular, they will be 1/2 or 1/3 of their current price. As someone suggested, a 4k monitor might make a difference, though. 4k gaming is great, and a huge monitor can be great if you usually have many windows opened. </TEXT>
