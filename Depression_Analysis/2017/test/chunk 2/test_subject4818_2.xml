	<TEXT> Everyone does great following the pro.

Pro lead everyone into the basement.

Everyone bags up every engine.

"What do we do now Mr.pro?"

"Have fun playing doctor you idiots"

Pro throws grenades at us and leaves. 

What an asshole. 

I proceed to lead the team. 

"Grab a bag boys"

I'm the only one who doesn't get knocked down so I take my engine to the helicopter. 

"Restart the game" everyone says

(It's a pro job)

Waiting feels like forever when I'm all alone. 

.......

..it's the right engine on the first try. Team goes bananas at my luck. 


Best feeling ever </TEXT>
