	<TEXT> I would probably have a panic attack. Cry a lot. Call my sister. No answer, travel to her apartment. Cry some more. Then take her car and drive a whole day to my parents house. Find my family and bury them all at the family plot. Take my dogs and live at my parents cabin teaching myself survival skills hoping I learn enough to survive. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not a book but Thomas Nagel's The Absurd. It expressed and validated everything I felt my whole life. After reading that I decided that the meaning of life is to give life meaning. Felt 1000x happier. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The saying "it takes a village to raise a child" applies to my big family. Grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins are not afraid to discipline each other's kids or call each other out on shitty parenting. Sometimes we'll recruit a relative we think will be most effective to talk to another relative about their actions or behaviour. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was 12 years old. Hometown has an adult dance after the family dance. This was before the town's alcohol ban so it was a pretty popular dance for the adults. I spent New Years at my grandmas where she was also watching her other grandkids whose parents also went to the adult dance. She didn't have a tv so we played card games all night. At midnight people started shooting blanks from their guns cos thats a thing here for big events. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I really like being your friend. I think we could be very good lifetime friends. You make me feel like I'm capable of so much more. I'm also happy you're more comfortable with sharing your thoughts and feelings with me because it makes me feel closer to you. I don't want to lose you. But, if you're hoping for more than a friendship, it isn't gonna happen. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I sometimes think it's cultural and maybe a little bit biological. My dad is shy as well as my sister and me. My adopted siblings are not shy and neither is my mom. I was shy because I was incredibly self aware and that made me very self conscious. I had a happy childhood and was never bullied. Kids were always nice to me. I was sheltered a lot too. My dad and my sister learned to cope with their shyness by creating public personas but they're still very much introverts. I didn't create a public persona for myself but I learned to control my shyness after years of practice because I was tired of being shy. I'm still introverted though. It took years of practice, years of awkward moments, stilted conversation, and trial and error to learn to cope with my shyness and make friends for the first time ever. Dealing with my shyness is still an ongoing process.

I do think shyness is related to a fear of rejection. When I'm struggling with my shyness and force myself to be confident, I feel a sense of fear and if I feel I'm "rejected", it fucking hurts. But I think "fuck it," life is too short. I heal that rejection and move on.

I also think it's cultural because my old hometown was a very shy town. The people were just shy towards outsiders unless the outsider goes out of their way to be friendly, then they're accepted into the fold. But the new generation is not like this. They're very outgoing, friendly, and eager to experience new things. </TEXT>
