	<TEXT> I tend to find that the 'spark' doesn't appear until you are comfortable with the person - particularly when you're actually going out. If you asked him out (I assume he'll say yes) and both of you relax, you will have a lot more fun together. The awkwardness will disappear when he doesn't feel he constantly has to impress you (which he does if he likes you).

Also, the 'chemistry' mentioned in movies can be exaggerated, and is better labelled as 'having fun in their company.' Expecting some strange and magical feeling of love at first sight to suddenly strike you down is quite simply not going to happen. </TEXT>

Well there's your problem. Sorry mate, but you're about to hear some harsh truths. 

You're a *nice guy* - otherwise referred to as the most unattractive object in the world. Sorry. There's an excellent guide to helping you in r/askwomen or something, and I'll link you to it when I'm not on my phone, unless somebody helpful will do it for me. 

Basically you're coming across totally wrong - in your desire to not be a loser, you're making yourself even more so. Rather than conveying 'a sensitive, caring guy who just wants love,' you're putting across 'needy, possibly obsessive, and high maintenance with very low self-esteem.'

they say I'll find somebody

Can you please elaborate more on the conversation leading up to this? It will help us dissect what you're saying wrong. 

I have no doubt that you're a great guy with a lot to offer a girl - and you *need* to believe this too - but the way you're conveying yourself is unfortunately of a weak, needy... loser.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I suppose at 18 I'm not really old enough to say 'I know how you feel,' but I'm going to anyway.

I don't know what's wrong with me. I always try to be outgoing, happy and fun, I have numerous friends (mostly female, in fact) in several circles who think I'm funny and good company, I go well out of my way to ensure people around me are happy. I dress as well as I can afford (thank you MFA), I always try to be polite, and I don't think I'm stupid. I'm a paid, professional singer, and I can play guitar. I have no problems approaching girls and talking to them, and I don't think I'm boring - even so, I've studied r/socialskills intently. Sounds good on paper, right?

Wrong. 

I have always been the third wheel, for my entire life. I had one girlfriend for two months, who seriously fucked me over emotionally and then cheated on me with some sixteen year old cunt. My friends and hers (who are no longer her friends) all agree that I did everything perfectly - was understanding, supportive, romantic; in one girl's words "the perfect boyfriend." Besides her, not a single girl has ever shown interest in me, and whenever I try to initiate - which I do on a DAILY basis - they always make it more than clear that they're not interested. I've joined clubs and pursued hobbies, I've taken ballroom dancing classes, am involved in more musical ensembles than is healthy for my sanity. I go out drinking/dancing/clubbing; every person in the group will hook up with someone - except me. It doesn't matter. I meet so many people, and I'm friends with most of them almost instantly, but NONE of them ever display any interest in me beyond that. 

I've concluded that I'm ugly, which makes me a little sad, because there's nothing I can do about it (besides plastic surgery - fuck that shit), so I'm stuck being lonely for the rest of my life. 

P.S. I don't whinge about the 'friendzone' because that attitude is pathetic, but when a girl you really like refers to you as her Gay Best Friend it stings.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Being in a relationship is just like being really good friends, but with sex. If you're not having sex yet (totally understandable at her age, and it's important not to pressure her) then you don't even need to worry about that. Hang out, go to movies and shit, do whatever you would normally with other friends. Don't have sexual contact with anyone besides her. There is an implicit emotional connection; you will probably be her go-to person for emotional support, and likewise. 

The bottom line: have fun. It should be about opportunities, not duties.  </TEXT>
