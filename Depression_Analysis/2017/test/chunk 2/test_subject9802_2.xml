	<TEXT> Yep! I remember refusing to participate in swim class in high school and my gym teacher made me do laps walking around the pool. He also gave me a VHS of [My First Mister](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E24SGpVrs-s) because the girl in it reminded him of me. In retrospect, it was kind of creepy that he put that much thought into it, and the title is kind of wtf. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Note the fanny pack in the first photo... I don't even know what to say about those earrings, either. Heh, I remember he used to joke around and wear my **scrunchies** and jokingly call himself "Tina" in order to mess with my cousin and me... How he turned out to be a *relatively normal* human being is beyond me.

He also was diagnosed with [vitiligo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitiligo) when he was a freshman in high school. He used to get picked on a lot because he wore makeup to cover the blotches. He was able to stop the progression of it by doing radiation, I believe. By the time he graduated, he was one of the most popular kids in high school. Complete 180. </TEXT>

Hippopotamus also sweat red! Their sweat is much more viscous and works as a natural sunblock. Maybe you're just more evolutionarily advanced!

I have a ton of tattoos inspired by biology/zoology and I'm particularly fond of birds, but I am so sick of hearing "Put a bird on it." I'm curious if either of you ever have experiences like that... </TEXT>
