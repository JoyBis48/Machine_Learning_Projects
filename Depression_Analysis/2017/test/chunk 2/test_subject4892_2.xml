	<TEXT> The bobcats have such a lack of scorers in place right now though. I could see him going 15/6/5 on 41% shooting and making a serious run at ROY. I think that'd be his best case scenario. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's really difficult to get an idea how good his game is going to translate to the NBA. 90% of those highlights were the result of hilariously bad defenses that he'll never see (unless he's playing Andre Blatche) here. He definitely has unquestionable athleticism, but I think he's going to have some growing pains while he starts to figure out how NBA centers work, and I expect him to have a *much* better 2nd half of his rookie season than first. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Overall not a talented scorer by any stretch, extremely poor free throw shooter, passing skills prowess is inflated (via his assist numbers) because he plays with the big-3 as opposed to, say, Deron's situation in NJ last year.

I don't necessarily agree with those arguments. But those are usually what's brought up. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> *In 1992*

1. Magic was already retired, and was becoming a serious defensive liability for the Lakers leading up to that point. Chris Paul today is probably the best defensive point guard in the NBA, and overall he's absolutely better than 1992 Magic

2. Scotty Pippen v. Kevin Durant  is impossible to say conclusively in either direction. Durant is plausibly the best pure scorer in the NBA right now, but Scotty Pippen was much better defensively.

3. Larry Bird's back was going out by '92, he was a significantly worse player that year than Westbrook was this year. 

4. I wouldn't call Stockton a better player than Deron; Stockton's legacy comes more from his insane durability and his incredible passing skills, but outside of that he was very one dimensional. Deron is a much better defender (read: average) and is a much more capable scorer as well.

Edit: after going back and looking at Stockton, I'm definitely wrong about him, so nevermind on point 4. </TEXT>

2. His defensive rebound numbers were low because Dwight is a defensive rebound vacuum.

3. He had 3.7 offensive rebounds a game last year, 5th most in the entire NBA.

4. Why are you talking about Ibaka? They're very differently built players. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would definitely make two part movie of final fantasy VII. The first one would end right after [game spoiler alert] Aerith's death. I'd probably have to cut out certain events, like most of the more minuscule parts of the journey through the midgar sectors, probably Yuffie/Wutai altogether, and the Cloudless hunts for the huge materia.

Peter Jackson would direct it, because the Lord Of The Rings style of epic is the only way this film could be pulled off. Jeremy Renner would be cast as cloud, Kristen Stewart would be Aerith, Chris Hemsworth as Sephiroth, Carey Mulligan as Tifa, Colin Farrell would be Vincent Valentine, Bryan Cranston as professor Hojo, Brendan Gleeson as the voice of Cait Sith (he's supposed to have an accent), John Hamm as the voice of Red XII, Terry Crews as Barret Wallace, and Bruce Willis as Cid Highwind.

The movie would definitely have 5-6 incredibly surreal Kubrickian long-shots, including the destruction of sector 7, the journey down the northern crater, the flashbacks to nibelhelm and Cloud/Tifa's descent into the lifestream.

This will never happen though :( </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Quick refresher in terms of beliefs: Presbyterians generally believe in reformed theology, which is largely based in [these five points](http://calvinistcorner.com/tulip), that were established above and beyond Luthor's theological break from Catholicism, whereas Methodists, whose theology comes from the reflections of John Wesley (who founded Methodism more as a way of life, trying to be "methodical" about living holy) rejected those views and embraced [Arminianism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arminianism) which is essentially an exact opposite stance all five points previously mentioned. That's how those two differ, anyways. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No, seriously, what the fuck reddit. You've been bitching nonstop since this site was creating about how our due process rights are eroding, how the death penalty is simply wrong (regardless of the level of doubt). And now that people are killing endangered animals instead of humans *you're completely okay with it.*

Shitty hypocrisy is shitty. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For me personally, I enjoyed the simplicity. I think a lot of times when videogames try and put a complex moral framework around a villain they often fail and it's usually a criticism of the game. FFVI didn't even try; they just went for pure, simple, evil. It's a breath of fresh air.

Not only is abnormal for a villain to be so straight-forwardly evil, but he actually succeeds too. He destroys the world of balance. Those two factors make for a very unique and wonderful villain. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This isn't a logical fallacy of anecdotal evidence dude. When someone makes a claim "all people can float" you only need one data point of "nonfloater" to prove it wrong.
