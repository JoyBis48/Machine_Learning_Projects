	<TEXT> Although in french it looks like a good and original system what i don't seem to like is the limited number or powers and such, but i may try to house rule some more in there.

I like the weapons having free will, i can already imagine a paladin with a murderous rapist sword, you know, classy stuff, like in the example of the guy saving two girls and the sword wanting a "peculiar reward" against the wielder's will. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I love those kinds of systems, i know about Nobilis, Chuubo, Don't rest your head, Mage the awakening, amber dice less one thing i disliked about amber is it's short array of powers, i like having alot of room to choose.

Also giving little more info on how powerful can a character be would be great. </TEXT>
