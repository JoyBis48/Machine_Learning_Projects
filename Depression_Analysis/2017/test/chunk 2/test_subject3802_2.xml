	<TITLE> YN-460 Speedlite for first external flash? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2012-09-04 14:04:14 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hey there r/photography. Recently I've been wanting to get an external flash because I feel limited with what I can currently do with the onboard one (I like to do a lot of portraiture). I currently use a Canon 20D and I'm on a pretty tight budget. I was wondering if the [YN-460](http://www.ebay.com/itm/YONGNUO-Speedlite-YN460-Canon-EOS-Rebel-XT-XTi-XTs-/160593250447?_trksid=p5197.m1992 _trkparms=aid%3D111000%26algo%3DREC.CURRENT%26ao%3D1%26asc%3D14%26meid%3D1806658724969685563%26pid%3D100015%26prg%3D1006%26rk%3D3%26) would be suitable for my needs? I mostly do a lot of indoor portraiture.

I was also considering getting a stand/tripod I could mount the flash on (use it as slave). Would [this](http://www.ebay.com/itm/Hot-Shoe-Flash-to-Bracket-stand-Mount-Adapter-Trigger-/220982002387?pt=Camera_Flash_Accessories hash=item33738dc2d3) and [this](http://www.ebay.com/itm/656-200cm-PROFESSIONAL-Light-Stand-Tripod-for-Photo-Studio-Video-Lighting-2m-/290764698956?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0 hash=item43b2ed354c) do the job?

Thanks in advance! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When I replied to your comment I thought you just were talking about how the original AOKP toggles take up too much space, especially since they can't be hidden in the JB notification shade. I was just saying that there is an implementation that takes up as much space as CM's. The only differing aspect of the appearance that I can see is the lines underneath? Otherwise they're pretty much exactly the same. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't think it could be done with tasker without a reboot. The only way I can see this working is with the Paranoid Android ROM. Its DPI changing interface is the only thing I know that can change from phone to tablet UI without requiring a reboot (it simply restarts the framework-ui, which takes a few seconds)

OP, your best bet is to install PA and just change to the tablet UI when you need it. It only takes a few seconds. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I politely disagree.

Maybe you're seeing different kind of therapists to me, but I think they provide a wonderful service. Let me tell you why.

Going to a therapist is shit. Even if its helped you at some point, everyone has to admit its awkward, feels pointless and embarrassing. You feel like you're wasting everyone's time and money. Even now, with the knowledge that therapy has helped me make HUGE headway in my recovery, I still dread going to see him. 

But the thing is, every now and then, there's that one session. You walk in, and you just gush and gush and gush. And even if they say something you think is stupid, or you disagree with, the fact that you've got someone there to bounce ideas and solutions for problems you may be experiencing off, is the best feeling. Even if you go to 100 sessions and only 1 of them is like that, it is 100% worth it.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Weird text issue with Chrome (text clipping? not sure what to call it) </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2012-08-20 13:09:21 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I've been having a weird problem recently, I'm not sure exactly when it started occurring (ie whether or not it began with a recent update to Chrome or some significant change in my system). Anyways, basically what happens is that on some sites, for example on Youtube, I get this weird text clipping issue where half of some of the characters appears to be clipped off/missing. Here's a screenshot http://i.imgur.com/GX996.png (notice the clipped letters in the comment, the most obvious one being the "E"). As you can see I'm running Windows 7.

I assume its either a font issue or something to do with something called Windows Cleartext or ClearType, I can't remember what its called or how to reach the setting in control panel.

Also, now is as good a time as any to ask why the look of disapproval ( #3232;\_ #3232;) appears as 2 boxes for me (see screenshot: http://i.imgur.com/K3ddQ.png)

Any help for either of these issues would be appreciated! </TEXT>

I can't tell you that your life is worth living, or point out the good things in your world or tell you who to talk to. Possibly a close friend or family member could provide that sort of assistance to you, but certainly not a stranger over the internet.

I can however tell you that you *deserve* to live. You deserve the right to a depression-free, happy life - and from one person to another, I sincerely hope you fucking make it mate, I really do. I'd say I'd understand, because I've been there, I've been on the edge, that teetering point of sanity and insanity - but I can't understand you. Everyone's battle is different. Not harder, not easier - different. Hardship is subjective and I don't think anyone should ever claim to know what anybody is going through.

I know its bullshit and its frustrating, especially if I, or anyone else, tell you that only you can do it, only you can move forward. The only thing other people can do is be there. They can just hang around and support you. They can stop you from moving backwards, but the forwards is all on your own. Hopefully you have people like that in your life, that are willing to be there for you in your time/s of need. I was lucky enough to have a huge support network. But I can proudly say I made the journey to where I am now entirely on my own.

You made it this far. Don't back down. You're worth it. </TEXT>

"Google Now" is *technically* only the notifications you get in the shade without interacting with the device; eg. I frequently get "traffic to home". Google Now utilizes the new (4.1+) Google search interface (which is what the cards are) to display its information. *Technically* the new "cards" interface is not actually "Google Now" - it is just Google search.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Wow thats embarrassing haha. Okay now I've processed that and got t'(x), found the x value of the stationary point - how do I verify that this is minimum again?
Find the minimum of t by computing t(0), t(x0) and t(8).

Stuck on this too. Are they just random values? And what is t(x0) - I've never encountered that.

Again, apologies for being thick. :( Thanks so much for helping me out. </TEXT>

t(x) = ((36+x) 100/b + 8-x) / V

A little confused as to how you got here. Obviously you substituted W = bV/100 back into the equation and simplified it, but how did you get here? When doing that I get something like:
(100(x^2 + 36) - xb + 8b)/bV </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Okay firstly I'm just going to type out the question word for word:

Alex, an accomplished runner, has just been dropped off at Bandicoot Camp in the bush. The roads back to her home on Dugong Lane run south for 6km to the top of Cassowary Hill and then east 8km to the turn off for Dugong Lane. After limbering up for a run home through the bush, she gets a call on her mobile that she needs to get home quickly and there is no transport available at the camp.

Alex decides to run through the bush directly to the road heading east from Cassowary Hill to Dugong lane on a bearing of 135^o T.

If she runs at V km/h on the road to Dugong lane and b% of V through the bush, evaluate whether this is the best heading to run on?

Investigate Alex's options if she runs along the southerly road to Cassowary Hill between 10% to 20% faster than she can run through bush.

You will be assigned a value of V and b from the tables below. Circle your assigned values.

My assigned values are: **V km/h = 20** and **b = 50, b = 61**

I've gotten as far as drawing up a [diagram](http://i.imgur.com/JqJLg.png) to represent the paths, with the diagonal line being the direction Alex is travelling in (through the bush). I'm having a total mind blank and can't get any further than that. :/ Any help would be appreciated. </TEXT>

**edit** Forgot to mention that the top inner angle of the triangle is 45^o (because 180 - 135 = 45) </TEXT>
