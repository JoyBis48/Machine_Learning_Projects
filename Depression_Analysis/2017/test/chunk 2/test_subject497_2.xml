	<TEXT> I am very *very* thankful for that. I was something of a borderline-skeptic before. If I wasn't *so sure* that she still existed in this universe somewhere I think I would be in a much worse state of mind right now. I really needed those last few hours together, and I think she knew that.

	<TEXT> Thank you for your kind words. It's a slight relief to share the weight of it with people who will listen without judgement.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you. 

The doctors said she had an aneurysm, and the coroner listed it as "natural causes", which to me, just seems so baffling for someone her age. 

She didn't smoke and she wasn't over weight. She did have just slightly high blood pressure which runs in her family, but she took good care of herself and ate a good diet. 

She hadn't complained of any symptoms leading up to it so I don't know if she felt them or not. 

Since she was asleep when it happened, I personally really don't think she would have felt any pain or anything like that.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Please do. I'm happy for you and your wife, it's a comforting reminder that joy and love still exist out there, even if *I* am sort of on pause for a bit. 

Please, forget trivial disagreements, realize the value in every moment and make as many pleasant memories together as you can.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you. I know maybe it sounds cliche, but writing about it has been a little therapeutic.  </TEXT>
