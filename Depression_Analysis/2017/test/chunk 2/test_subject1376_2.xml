	<TEXT> I'm not the best at getting my thoughts written down. I thought I made the point that if you have been designing for a while it is part of the natural progression of things, or at least it seems that way for me.

A huge portion of my job recently when developing apps or websites is the UX end of things, and it naturally lead to choosing to do that full time as opposed to just doing it along with developing the UI and actually building it all (html, javascript, Xcode etc).

If your job already has you doing these things, and you enjoy that end of it, then you should consider doing it full time as it is a good way to step into a higher position and make more money. I should have been more clear on that point. I didn't mean to come across as saying you should do UX only for the money, as in my experience that is one of the last reasons to do work. I think I actually had an entire section about doing work you enjoy but my friend who read through the article told my I had too many tangents :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sorry I've been in the digital end of design for so long now I just assume everyone knows what it is :)

Part of my new years resolution is to "not be such a shitty writer" and I suppose part of that is not making assumptions about the audience. It actually took me most of the day to write this. I didn't know getting my thoughts out on 'paper' was so difficult. </TEXT>

I know none of those ask for a decade of experience and a masters degree, but I have seen those posts in the past. I always assume it is just someone in HR posting a bunch of stuff they don't understand. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I went from an Intuos3 to a cintiq and I'm happy with the switch. The intuos is a bit faster and more responsive, but I only have a 21UX. I imagine the new 24hd and 24hd touch are better.

I still love drawing on the screen more than on the intuos, but as you said the price jump is pretty significant. </TEXT>
