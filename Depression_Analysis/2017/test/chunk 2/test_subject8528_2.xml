	<TEXT> My guess is that it will air in January. I've noticed over the past six or so years of watching currently airing anime that the vast majority of the time when they announce a show it is one full season away from airing. 

The actual explanation of this is that they do not want to lose the hype from the fanbase for the second season by making them wait. Yes, there are some outliers such as Grisaia (Which is finally airing this season) and Dog Days''' (Airing this January) both of which were announced years ago. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That was the PS3. The PS3 used the cell architecture which was new for the PS3, this is what made it hard for valve.

The PS4, on the other hand, uses a 64 bit architecture and the OS is a certain distro/version of linux. Valve has been pouring a lot into putting their games, and others, on Linux. (What do you think SteamOS is?)

	<TEXT> My second favorite "genre" or trope of sorts is when someone gets sent to an alternate world where they have to either try and survive or figure out a way back.

Some notable anime examples:

* [Isekai no Seikishi Monogatari](http://myanimelist.net/anime/5781/Isekai_no_Seikishi_Monogatari)
* [Oda Nobuna no Yabou](http://myanimelist.net/anime/11933/Oda_Nobuna_no_Yabou)
* [Monaiji-tachi ga Isekai kara kuru Sou Desu yo?](http://myanimelist.net/anime/15315/Mondaiji-tachi_ga_Isekai_kara_Kuru_Sou_Desu_yo)
* [Outbreak Company](http://myanimelist.net/anime/19369/Outbreak_Company)

A notable manga:

* [Gate: Thus the JSDF Fought There](http://myanimelist.net/manga/41733/Gate:_Jieitai_Kanochi_nite_Kaku_Tatakeri)

Not exactly necessary, but I would like some romance/comedy aspect(s) to it.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> A bit of an odd question but I thought I should ask it here. My Mother, who is an elementary school media specialist (as she teaches more than just books), is looking to get a few series for the library. These would be, mainly, for fourth and fifth graders.

I know Shounen Jump would be a good place to start but even then some of the content could be iffy.

There are other graphic novels (not manga) in the library but I do not know what ones. 

Possible ideas: Azumanga Dioh, Yotsuba! </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I came across a thread on GameFaqs that you can use a DAC on the PS4 by just plugging it in. 

I tried it for myself and it worked! (Quite well too.) I am unsure of whether or not you have to change the audio output to bitstream, which I did before trying, but it worked.


I tried the Audioengine D1 but I would imagine that others would work too.

---

You may be asking yourself, why does the PS4 have this and not mp3/flac/wav/ogg support? My guess is that since the PS4's OS is based off of linux they kept the drivers needed for this to work. (Heck, it is probably part of the kernel) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I normally sit in the chat of a group that I am in, along with ~10-20 others, which makes it into a sort of IRC thing. 

The issue is that for the past few days every single link except for youtube.com and steampowered.com results in having to [click through Steam's website](https://i.imgur.com/8yWhm3z.png) to get to the actual link. Even imgur is being affected by this.

I only click links I trust and from people I know. I just want it to stop as it adds anywhere from 10 to 15 seconds extra loading time. (Having to load the page, click the button, wait for the actual site to load.) When you normally click anywhere from 10 to 15 links or more a night it adds up to be quite a bit of time. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I bought Contraption Maker ($15 value) and it, apparently, comes with a copy to give to someone. Since the game gave me a second copy, each copy is worth $7.50 so I'm just asking for a $5 amazon gift card. (Paypal and Bitcoin are also options)

If you ever played the old Incredible Machine series, this is in the same vein and it is even made by some of the people who worked on that series. 

This trade will occur through Steam since it is a gift.

	<TEXT> OP of the [original post](http://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/27sw0l/introducing_rumble_make_videos_and_get_paid/) here with an update on my payment status.

Initially, I thought that you were paid on the Friday of the week that you requested but that is not the case. Once you "Cash out" they pay you the Friday AFTER you do so. Also, the minimum cash out is $50.

I had a video get approved and I was paid $125 two weeks ago. I was paid on June 20th. (It just turned midnight here)

	<TEXT> I feel as though I have seen most if not all of the entire comedy/romance genre that is geared towards guys. I try to avoid shows with gratuitous fan service (DxD, etc...).

Some examples of ones I really enjoyed:

* Toradora
* Clannad 
* White Album 2
* Seitokai no Ichizon
* True Tears

[Here is my MAL](http://myanimelist.net/animelist/bookkid900)

To help slim down and make is easier to find what ones I have seen, I also have a list of just Comedy/Romance shows [here.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0Ah64P40sBB2KdHYxQ0N6QmNlenZHLW8xaFNiZWRsQmc output=html) (It is on Google Docs) </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Introducing "Rumble" - Make videos and get paid! </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-06-10 19:29:56 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> This is a site I came across and decided to give it a try. I uploaded a [video](https://rumble.com/v2z7i1-the-worlds-busiest-intersection.html) that I had to the site last night and I got an [email](http://i.imgur.com/hxTH9oa.png) today stating that I received $125 for that video.

 **What is Rumble?**

It is a video hosting site, much like YouTube and Vimeo, but they have partners such as MTV, Xbox, MSN, Yahoo, etc.. As such they are paying users to submit their videos for them to then use on and with these partners. If your video is approved, you get $50 but if your video is good enough to be put on the front page they will pay you $100+.

---

**How can I earn money on Rumble?**  
There are four different ways for you to monetize your video(s):

 * **Profit Sharing** - You give all rights to Rumble and earn 90% of the earnings on YouTube and 60% of the earnings from their partners.  
 * **Exclusive** - You give all rights to Rumble and can make up to $1000.
 * **Non-Exclusive** (This is what I did) - You keep your rights to your video and can make up to $500. This grants Rumble a non-exclusive license to your video. (ie. They can still use it with their partners, but you still own it.)
 * **Not for Sale** - Who'd want to do that?

--

**What is Rumble looking for in a video?**

* Good title and description  
 * They changed my title and description, but make sure it is a good one such that the editors know what it is about.
* *Original content*
* High Quality Video (ie. Something that looks nice rather than thrown together.)

---
**What if I don't have any videos to upload?**  

 * You can make about $0.25 a day through tagging videos. (5 videos a day at $0.05 per)  
 * You could always make a video to upload.

---

**Payment Proof (*NOT MINE!*)**  
[Here](http://i.imgur.com/lZPjE6A.png)
  
My Pending Amount: [Old](http://i.imgur.com/jtHaqec.png) | [NEW!!!](http://i.imgur.com/uYlf9nd.png)

Looking through a few threads about this site it seems as though they pay on Fridays. 

**Links**: [Ref](https://rumble.com/register/bookkid900/) | [Non-Ref](https://rumble.com/)

UPDATE: [I got paid!](http://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/28p6b2/update_on_rumble_make_videos_and_get_paid/)

EDIT: Fixed the payment proof link.

EDIT 2: Added the "What is Rumble?" section.

IMPORTANT: Rumble has updated their layout! I have updated my pending amount image.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> First off, I have been looking at getting a Wii U for a few months now and have saved up money on Amazon to get it.
---
---
In terms of next-gen consoles, I already have a PS4. This is what I will use for most multi-platform games.


Last year I got the 3DS and I loved being able to play the new Mario and Zelda games along with titles such as Fire Emblem, Rune Factory 4 and Mario Kart 7.  

I really want to get Mario Kart 8 which in turn will allow me to get WW:HD for free and to get the new Smash Bros down the road, but I am not sure if these games warrant a $300 console.  
--

Wii U games I am looking at getting: 

* New Zelda (The one to be announced at E3)
* New Super Mario/Luigi Bros U (Comes with the bundle)
* Super Mario 3D World
* Mario Kart 8
* Super Smash Bros for Wii U
* The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker HD (Free w/ MK8)
* Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze

With the MK8 Promotion, it has lessened the time that I have to make a decision as the free game helps.

	<TEXT> What does the Bible say about visiting other religion's festivals/occasions?

The reason I am asking is that I am going on a two week study abroad trip to Japan in May. While we are in Japan, there is a [big shinto festival](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanja_Matsuri) that they have figured out a way for us to go see. While no one in the class will be partaking in this from a religious perspective, nevertheless we will be there. As such, I am unsure of what the Bible says to do in these sorts of situations.

Could anyone, if they are knowledgeable in this, be willing to share their thoughts on this matter? </TEXT>

The way they did the training mode was good, where it introduces wall-running before combat (where people would just leave since they think they know what they are doing) but there is little reminding people about these mechanics.

I know that after awhile, people will begin to use the wall running to their advantage but as of now it is quite silly to see a match go like that. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I am looking for a good JRPG that will be fun to play.

RF4: I haven't played any other games in the series, but I have played Animal Crossing. (I haven't played AC in a while)

M L: I played, and loved, Superstar Saga back on the GBA and I had Bowser's Inside Story but I never got too far in that one.

Bravely Default: This the JRPG that everyone has been hyping up for a while, especially since it has been out in Europe for awhile.

---
My experiences with JRPGs: I really like them, but after a while I either transition off to other games or get suck (like in Star Ocean on the 360/PS3). The closest that I have gotten to beating a JRPG was: Superstar Saga, Ar Tonelico: Qoga, Paper Mario and the Thousand Year Door and also some of the recent Zelda games.

The only one I finished, and due to using action replay, was Final Fantasy IV for the DS. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> The September Question for the EDvisory Panel is up! </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-09-18 02:40:22 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> For those of you who have clicked on this and wondering what in the world I am talking about, there was a post up about a month ago about it on this subreddit. [Here is a link to that post](http://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/1ktmvf/get_some_steady_brewfunds_seeking_privatecharter/).

TL;DR: It is a panel that asks those on the panel to respond to a question with five or more sentences. Once they read over and approve your response, they will send you a link to redeem a $25 gift card for another site where you can get gift cards ranging from Amazon to iTunes. This will happen once a month for the next year, well 11 months from this point in time.

	<TITLE> [SIB] Tales of the Abyss for the 3DS? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-09-01 19:37:31 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I have been looking into getting Tales of the Abyss for the 3DS for a little while. I have played Tales of Xillia on my PS3 and I really like it so far but I was wondering if I should get Tales of the Abyss for my 3DS. 

I really lime JRPGs but I never really seems to finish them. 


So, what are your thoughts? </TEXT>
