	<TITLE> Question for the ex-Shia Muslims (ex-muslim shias?) </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-06-22 18:22:32 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Yes, Wazzym's x-post piqued my interest.

My question is, what are some of core beliefs in Shia Islam that diverge from orthodoxy?  When I ask sunnis, I obviously get biased answers like "kafirs, heretics, blasphemers, blah blah blah"

From my very brief reviews of various writings, it seemed that Shias were a little more objective in their treatment of the prophets companions and wives, and didn't hold them up to "saintly" status.

I understand the Imams and all that nonsense.  I want to know more about their views on hadith, the sahabas, and wives or the prophet. </TEXT>

I'm trying to get actual answers through discussion.  I don't want to turn this into ZI's defense testimony.  I don't want a referendum on political correctness.  I just want people's opinions on this specific question.

I've had this conversation with only one redditor so far, and we were able to keep it civilized, so hopefully the 
same can be expected of everybody else.

edit:  please let's not turn this into an /r/atheism "socrates died for our memes" type issue.  I just want to know how people feel about this ONE question. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I brought up a Las Vegas meetup before.  Most of the meetups are localized to big cities, so those of us in the boondocks can't really go.  

But if we were to have a destination vacation type meetup, people would have plenty of time to prepare, and we could have shit loads of fun.  Plus, most summer cities are cheap as hell this time of year, like Vegas, because of the weather.

Does anyone have any real interest in this, or am I just high?  (I'm not high.....yet) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> One of which was blatant misogyny.  When we talk about the women who follow islam being misguided and acting against their own benefit, we aren't being sexist.  We (at least I) are talking from a place of pain, after watching our mothers, sisters, and wives fall victim to this brainwashing.  Calling out that bullshit on this sub is not misogyny.  It is venting.  We have no where else to talk about it, because no one else understands where we are coming from.

No other apostates from any other religion in the world have experienced the gender inequality that we experienced/participated in as muslims.  This is a huge point of frustration and anger for us.  So please, SRS, don't come into this sub and tell us how we should feel and/or act about this.  This is not your sub, it is ours. 

I can't speak for everyone, but I'll tell you how I feel about muslim women.  I feel the same way about them as Liberal democrats feel about poor rednecks who protest against Obamacare.  People who are opposing their own interest/well being/safety.  Islam is not safe for women.  I personally feel that muslim women are brainwashed into believing the exact opposite.  I have the right to these beliefs, and I have the right to share them without being called a misogynist.  So take your overly politically correct sensitivity training back to SRS, and stay out of our business.

Are my feelings coming from a source of male privelage?  No.  They come from knowing the freedom of experiencing how wonderful life is without the soul crushing and life defeating menace that is Islam.  It ruined my life.  It is currently ruining my mother's life, and that of my sisters and female cousins. 

Is there anyting you SRSers don't get mad about?  If I talk negatively about women who don't see the harm they subject themselves to, I'm a misogynist.  If I talk negatively about muslim transgressions and abuses, I'm an Islamophobe.  What exactly is the name of your world, where everybody loves everybody, and religions respect each other and don't cause hardship to women and conflict all over the world?

Just leave us alone.


edit:  I apologize for the overly possesive "our sub, not yours" comment.  Of course all are welcome here, but the discussions shouldn't deviate from this sub's purpose, IMO. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> A golf buddy of mine says he is trying out a new swing that has him keep all his weight on his left leg throughout the entire swing.  He says it helps him with balance, and he is getting more distance from it.

He advised me to try this swing, since I'm still relatively raw in my skill (best score 97).

Have any of you played around with this swing(Balance on left leg almost entirely instead of even distribution)?

I've been told that for short shots around the green, this is great for not losing balance and hitting the ball in every which direction, he is insisting that this should be done on longer shots as well. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's disgusting.  On the one hand, muslims and their apologists throw out their "NTS" arguments, and in the same breath, claim that man cannot judge another man's intentions, and only God can judge.

It's hard to believe that they are typing the words out, reading them, and actually seeing no contradictory hypocrisy there.

	<DATE> 2013-04-11 20:40:38 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> The copy I am looking for is published by a prominent Pakistani company, whose name I can't remember.  This company's Quran publications are used in madrasas all over Pakistan and some parts of India.

Of particular note, this version contains 16 lines per page, as opposed to the more popular 13 line versions that are so common nowadays.

Is there anyone in Pakistan, or does anyone have connections to Pakistan, that could help me get a copy?

I am in the United States, and most, if not all, masjids here are filled with Egyptian or Arabian publications which contain 15 or 18 lines per page.

I know that this is very nitpicky, but this is for a gift for a friend of mine that I did hifz with 20 years ago.  I would give him mine, but the pages are not in gift-worthy condition. </TEXT>
