	<TEXT> ah yes, very true that opera handles much of the processing on the server side.  

But i've had extremely good browsing experience on both dolphin and the stock android browser. I feel they dont disapper off because they are very lightweight in nature.   

If Firefox has just a bare browser thing on android, it would be awesome.

4.1.1 device here :)   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> it actually doesnt involve particular pages.
For eg. scrolling through general sites like Facebook, Complex just close the browser down. (i did file a bugreport on this issue - https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1041968)  

Heavily noticed this happening while scrolling when the page is loading. </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2014-08-26 17:34:34 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I've noticed a lot on low RAM devices(=512), the browser just disappears after a light usage run. I mostly suspect an Out of memory situation is the cause of it.  

But if a really light version like the something in the likes of a opera mini version happens then firefox can surely run stable on low end mobile hardware. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> i really have a strange GPU issue while using firefox.  
My system dell n5110 has an Intel i3 and nvidia 525M optimus(Hybrid) running with bumblebee(Proprietary drivers) on Fedora Linux 20  
Every time i use Firefox, the GPU fan goes on and off over and over after a certain time of operation.  
My normal laptop temp is around 48-54C but when i use the browser its slowly rises above 60.  
The Processor clock jumps from 101MHz-1200MHz  
The Graphics clock jumps from 50MHz-600Mhz  

I've tried switching off Hardware Acceleration but this still happens.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Why does the close button have to disappear just after 8 tabs?  
Its kinda annoying. Chrome allows upto 18 tabs with the close button present.  

Im kinda sure people have more than 8 tabs opens in a normal browsing session.

 Fair point though, a bit of digging says SIGABRT is triggered by angry libraries? I'll tinker with profiles (add-ons) in mind. Thanks.

The content would have already streamed ahead by the player will start playing for a few seconds, stop and if it wish continue playing more or until i click the play button again.  

Also the loading(buffering) bar keeps going out of its limits into infinity and beyond.

	<TEXT> I don't see how Shumway will allow Firefox to get users back. Most people don't exactly use Flash voluntarily. They need it because video sites require use of patented codecs (H264) and DRM.

Linux users are fed up with Adobe flash(no new versions-except security updates), and most crashes happen due to flash or some flash based content on webpages. Plus lots of people use YouTube and other video based sites a good part of usage, having something inbuilt and stable like shumway like the way Google does with Pepper, it should probably improve the reliability of the browser. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Can you please file bugs about these issues? This sounds really strange, should absolutely not happen, and we don't know of any current issues like that. Do you have some task killer or anything installed that's nuking Firefox while it runs?

Sure i shall file a bug, but i just have no content to attach to a report sadly :/
It'll just close down without any message while browsing. And i dont use any task killer.
 
 It already uses very little memory, and will work well on any Android phone with as little as 384M RAM (Firefox uses FAR FAR less, but your other apps will eat up most of that!).

i do know it does uses very less, but when other apps are also present, then things get slow, like using swiftkey, whatsapp, facebook and firefox one after the other :/

	<TEXT> i think some DNS server is at fault.  
Unless someone fixes it, it'll be the same situation for people who are routed through that server or ISP.  

The bigger problem is that YouTube is not aware of this issue. Some thing similar happened to WhatApp users in india connected to a particular ISP. Only after the social media and news exploded was the service fixed.  

People need to inform YouTube about the issue! Attack Social Media! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hats off to the developer community for all the work they've done all these years. Truly, its been a great product. And i keep hoping for more good stuff from you guys! _/\_ MASSIVE RESPECT    

A little focus on more important things will probably show a positive change eventually. It will take time to fight back whats lost to chrome, but im sure a good number of them will be Firefox users who are wanting to come back to where they felt at home before.   

I guess Firefox also needs to increase its social media presence, Google can do it for Chrome through their ads system, but Firefox has to fight it out without spending much on Facebook, Twitter etc.

Once Firefox fixes up electrolysis and Shumway, that coupled with the privacy, peace of mind and the add on ecosystem, it will be a great combo to make some groundbreaking ad to get back whats lost, and add more new users.  

it will take time, but these should be worked on with a great pace now, coz time costs everything these days.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> i agree the attitude of the common man is hopeless.  

only few of us try to make a valid change. I try a lot to convince people to shift to Firefox. Some do but others just stick it to the other competition because it works out of the box and without any trouble.  

I still feel Firefox has every chance to grab back the market it lost, if it starts focusing on the current basic essentials to web browsing.  

Back to square one is the need of the hour. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> i feel the browser should focus on delivering speed, lower memory usage, per Tab process and shumway.  

Honestly i don't think normal people do care if a browser is super developer friendly with all the features it provides; The general crowd wants the content or webpage to load super fast and with very little to no problems.  

I've tired Firefox Beta on Android and the Nightly versions too, but there are lots of performance issues, when compared to others in the market. Ive got lots of instances when the browser will just close without even a Crash Pop-up to send an error report.  
Plus Firefox Mobile needs to make use of less resources(RAM etc.) of low end phones, since most of them are 512 MB RAM mediatek chipsets.

Its been a really long wait from the browser that was a game changer back then :( </TEXT>

	<TEXT> i think its a DNS issue, lots of people are facing this, but in certain locations, or based on the browser.  

Cause chrome is able to go through. But the YouTube android app is totally failing to play and same with Firefox.  

Using google dns solves this problem :D
YouTube or your ISP(im not sure whom) has to fix this problem.

	<TEXT> I've been noticing this for quite some time now, video's even though fully loaded tend to stutter a lot during playback.
It was more profound on vimeo, when the playback stop and the video  button changes from the pause button to play button. The video was fully loaded though - http://vimeo.com/48043470 - this was the video, while this thing was happening.  

Its also present on facebook videos, though to a lesser extent, and least on YouTube.  


I played the same vimeo video in another browser(chrome) and it was playing very well, even while streaming without any stutters.

I use it and am definitely happy. Of course there are minor bugs here and there bug for a normal user I don't think it'll be a problem.
