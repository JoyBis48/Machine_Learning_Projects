You guys have got a shot. How do you feel about Groce?

And I think that's debatable, Murray State is legit man. Once they got their full roster in place they started on that tear. That's not to say they'd be any better necessarily, I just don't think it's cut and dried. </TEXT>

Where it's bothering me is people acting like they're not a good basketball team. If you don't think this team is good, you either haven't seen them play, or have an axe to grind with them/mid-majors in general.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Honestly every time I've watched them (admittedly it's been the bigger games, many of which have been losses), I've thought they have no fight at all. It's seemed to me that when another team makes a run, it just drags on and on because Utah doesn't have the fight in them.

The one exception to this is Brandon Taylor. The only one consistently playing hard when they're losing. I wouldn't be surprised at all if they were about to get upset in the Round of 64 and Taylor put the whole team on his back for crunch time.  </TEXT>

I was lucky enough to be at both of the Arizona-SDSU games last year (I'm a UCSD alum haha, I live in the area), they were both fantastic atmospheres and fantastic games. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Honestly I think it depends what BYU does. If BYU only loses to Gonzaga in the WCC tournament, they have a good shot to get in the Big Dance, and both of Gonzaga's losses will be to tournament teams (1 on the road in OT to a fellow 2 seed). Hard to take that away.

And honestly, even if they lost in the WCC tournament it'd be hard to knock em off the 2 line. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The Top 25 was more as a recognition of a perfect conference record and not having lost in a really long time, than having actually earned their way into the polls.

I wish there was room for an at-large like Murray State, but the way selection works, pretty much every bubble team would have to take an awful loss in the conference tournaments to even think about it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I honestly don't know how much you can read into this one though. Once the blitz was on, it was on. This game was only contested for like 10 minutes, and the last 30 were just playing out the conclusion that was already written.

Davidson deserved to win, and win big, but VCU is better than this, even in the last three games, even without Briante. IMO.


That being said you could dead cat bounce through your next 2 games and get smoked in the tournament. Who knows. </TEXT>
