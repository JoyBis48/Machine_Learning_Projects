	<TEXT> When I was at Georgia Southern (I graduated in '12) the football games were free if you paid your athletic fee (about 150? but it included other things like renovation costs and the rec center access too).

I work for the University of Alabama and they run a fac/staff season ticket lottery based on seniority. You have to buy the whole season. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> OK I'm gonna use Alabama, because I work there. [They had eight players drafted in 2014](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Alabama_Crimson_Tide_players_in_the_NFL_draft).

Their starting kicker, Cade Foster, was not among them. He is now a free agent. 

Players like that, who don't get drafted yet expected to. What kind of a future can they look forward to? What's the likelihood they will get picked up? Do they have skills they can fall back on if not? I'm legitimately concerned. The graduation - employment rate is low enough as it is. I should know I am a (gainfully employed!) recent anthropology grad. :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If their coaches are not properly educating their players about what a long shot it is (about 3% according to the NCAA website, but that's across all divisions) then they are doing those kids a disservice. I'd really like to know what happens to the kid who stakes all his hopes on getting into the NFL and prepared for no other option. What does he do? Flip burgers? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think you got down votes because most Georgia Southern Fans don't think very highly of UGA even though we can't really be considered football 'rivals.' A lot of it goes way back to when Erk Russell left UGA to start our program. Some of it has to do with how hard they fought to block us becoming a University as well. We like Tech though. </TEXT>
