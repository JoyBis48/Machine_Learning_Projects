	<TEXT> Well, you got the bit in the first book when they serve detention with Hagrid looking for whatever was killing the unicorns.

You got the bit in the second book when Hagrid told Harry and Ron to follow the spiders.

The bit in the third book when Hagrid walked his CoMC class deep into the forest to get to the hippogiriffs.

And I would also like to ad the scene in OotP when Hagrid introduced the trio to Grawp, and also when Hermione led Umbridge, Ron and Harry deep into the forest where Grawp was.

Edit: Ron didn't go with Harry, Hermione and Umbridge. </TEXT>

The main thing I dislike about it is fuckin' Umbridge. If any character in the history of fiction has ever made my skin crawl as much as Dolores Umbridge.

But she got hers in the end didn't she?

Edit: I'll answer my own question. That was after a bit of a lull in the story, so it brought some excitement.

Kreacher belonged to the *Noble House of Black* and when Sirius told him to "Get out!" Kreacher took that as a command because Sirius was his master and he disappeared over the winter months, remember? Sirius was not very kind to Kreacher and the poor guy was locked up at 'Grim old place' with no one to talk to but Walburga's portrait. Padfoot even said he was crazy in the book.

When Harry inherited 12GP from Sirius he also inherited Kreacher, and that is why Kreacher was silenced when Harry told him to shut up in the chapter you spoke of, *Will and Won't?* One of my favorites. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think Ron did in the film, but I'm almost sure Slughorn did when Harry approached him the first time about the horcrux after Albus gave him the task, it could have been another time. Maybe Hagrid's hut?

Edit: I mean the book in the second examples.

	<TEXT> Absolutely. Albus says something to the effect of Horace likes collecting famous and powerful people, and that he would try to collect Harry.

Dumbledore thought that because Lily was Horace's favorite student, and that Harry was her son, that Harry would be able to extract the memory to further the plot. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I believe it was GoF after the graveyard that Dumbledore says that Harry Potter and Tom Riddle had gone farther to unite themselves than any two wizards in history that he knew of, so (paraphrasing) it was inevitable that there would be no way to completely keep them apart.

Albus was over 100 by then, a brilliant man such as himself would surely know wizarding history by now. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There is a great book that starts out, "Mr. and Mrs. Dursley of number four Privet drive were proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much."

I'd start there.

Edit: I would avoid all of the films until you have read each book. </TEXT>
