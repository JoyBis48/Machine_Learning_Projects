	<TEXT> The OP has a point. 

Take this for instance: the Dolphin Illusion - a child will see dolphins on the bottle where as, adults see a intimate pose (or most do). Research has shown that young children cannot identify the intimate couple because they do not have prior memory associated with such a scenario.

	<TEXT> I know it crossed my mind a time or two, but I rarely took it in to consideration. After meeting Dan Barker a few years back, I began to realize just how much of a problem this was. First off, we (the US) are not solely a 'Christian Nation' and symbolizing such a thing on US Currency only provides more problems. I'm not sure where to go from there because that should make it rather clear, but I would like to point out the fact that (former motto) 'E pluribus unum': One out of many - seemed just fine. </TEXT>

Here's the link:

"In God we trust " was adopted as the official motto of the United States in **1956** as an alternative or replacement to the unofficial motto of E pluribus unum, adopted when the Great Seal of the United States was created and adopted in 1782.[1][2]
"In God we trust" has appeared **on most** (not all) U.S. coins since 1864[3] and on paper currency since 1957

**    **

*: 4 *

1 cups red or brown lentils, rinsed

1 cup canned chopped tomatoes with their juice

3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil

8 garlic cloves, peeled

2 teaspoons coarse sea salt or kosher salt

4 slices peeled fresh ginger, each about the size of a quarter

1 sprig rosemary

1 bay leaf

1 (10 ounces) bag washed baby spinach

2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice

Freshly milled black pepper


1.	In a pressure cooker (*       20-25        *) over high heat, combine 5 cups of water with the lentils, tomatoes, oil, garlic, and salt.

Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 10 minutes.

2.	Transfer the pressure cooker to the sink and run cold water over it to release the pressure. Remove the lid and discard the bouquet garni. 

3.	Return the pot to medium heat. Add the spinach and simmer until wilted. Stir in the lemon juice. Crush the garlic against the side of the pot with the back of a spoon and stir so that all the garlic completely melts into the soup. Add pepper and serve immediately.

	<TEXT> Recipes in order: Quick-Cooked Tomatillo Sauce (Salsa Verde), Thick Cream (Crema Espesa), and Layered Tortilla Casserole  (Budn de Tortillas) 

**Quick-Cooked Tomatillo Sauce** (Salsa Verde)

Ingredients: (Yield 2 to 3 cups)

-	1 lb (11 medium) fresh tomatillos, husked and washed OR two 13-ounce cans tomatillos, drained.

-	Fresh hot green chiles to taste (roughly 3 chiles seranos or 2 chiles jalapenos), stemmed

-	5 or 6 sprigs fresh coriander (cilantro), roughly chopped

-	1 small onion, chopped

-	1 large clove garlic, peeled and roughly chopped

-	1 tablespoon lard or vegetable oil

-	2 cups any poultry or meat broth (depending on how the sauce is to be used)

-	Salt, about  teaspoon (depending on the saltiness of the broth)

1.	*The tomatillos*. Boil the fresh tomatillos and chiles in salted water to cover until tender, 10 to 15 minutes; drain. Simply drain canned tomatillos.
2.	*The puree*. Place the tomatillos and chiles (raw ones if using canned tomatillos) in a blender or food processor, along with the coriander, onion and garlic; if using a blender, stir well. Process until smooth, but still retaining a *little* texture.
3.	*The Sauce*. Heat the lard or vegetable oil in a medium-large skillet set over medium-high. When hot enough to make a drop of the puree sizzle sharply, pour it in all at once and stir constantly for 4-5 minutes, until darker and thicker. Add the broth, let return to a boil, reduce the heat to medium and simmer until thick enough to coat a spoon, about 10 minutes. Season with salt.

**Thick Cream** (Crema Espesa) 

***Instead of this recipe, we just mixed heavy whipping cream and sour cream. But, this is the more traditional approach to preparing thick cream. If preparing this, start a full day ahead (or longer, if the incubating spot is cool). The cream will keep for 1 weeks or more, covered and refrigerated. 

Ingredients:

-	1 cup whipping cream

-	2 tablespoons buttermilk

1.	*Preparing the cream*. Pour the cream into a small sauce-pan, set over low heat and stir just until the chill is off, *do not* heat above 100 (lukewarm). Stir in the buttermilk and pour into a glass jar
2.	*Ripening the cream*. Set the lid on the jar (but dont tighten it) and place in a warm (80-90) spot. Let the cream culture and set for 12 to 24 hours, until noticeably thicker (perhaps almost set like yogurt or sour cream). Stir gently, screw on the lid and refrigerate at least 4 hours to chill and complete the thickening. 

**Layered Tortilla Casserole**  (Budn de Tortillas)

Ingredients:

-	Vegetable Oil

-	12 corn tortillas (we used soft corn tortillas)

-	2 cups Quick-Cooked Tomatillo Sauce (Salsa Verde)  *recipe above*

-	3 large chile poblanos (we used 5 Anaheim peppers) -- Roasted, peeled, seeded and sliced

-	1 cups Thick Cream, or thinned commercial sour cream  *recipe above*

-	1 cups (6 ounces) grated melting cheese like mild cheddar of Monterey Jack.

1.	Quick-fry 12 corn tortillas in vegetable oil, 2 or 3 seconds per side, then drain well.
2.	Line the bottom of a 9-inch-square baking dish with 3 tortillas (slightly overlapping).
3.	Top with  of the sauce, cream and cheese, and 1/3 of the chiles; repeat with three more layers (the top will have no chiles).
4.	Cover and bake at 350 for 30 minutes. Strew with onion rings, (and radish rounds), then serve.
5.	Optional: 1 cups shredded cooked chicken, pork or fish can be layered with the chiles.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Recipe
(Arroz con Leche)*

This dessert is softer and more cinnamony than our baked rice pudding. The flavors are simple and close to home, but its easy to develop a thoroughgoing love for it, spoonful after spoonful. Mexican people everywhere serve it as regularly as they do flan; its creamy and, in its own way, light and soothing.

This is an especially pretty and tasty recipe, based on one from Zelayarans Las 500 mejores recetas de la cocina mexicana.

Yield : 8 to 10 servings

**Ingredients**

2 inches cinnamon stick
A 2-inch strip of lime zest (colored rind only),  inch wide
1 cup rice
1 quart milk
 cup sugar
 teaspoon salt
4 large egg yolks
 teaspoon vanilla extract
 cup raisins
1 tablespoon unsalted butter, cut into bits
Ground cinnamon, for garnish

Directions:

1. **The rice:** Bring 2 cups water to a boil in a medium-size saucepan, add the cinnamon stick and lime zest, then cover and simmer over medium heat for 5 minutes. Pour in the rice, let the mixture return to a boil, stir once, then cover and cook over medium-low heat for 20 minutes, until all the liquid is absorbed and the rice is tender.

2. **The pudding:** Stir in the milk, sugar and salt, and simmer over medium to medium-low heat, stirring frequently, until the liquid shows the first signs of thickening, 20 to 25 minutes. Take from the heat and remove the cinnamon stick and zest. Beat the egg yolks until runny, stir in the vanilla and a few tablespoons of the hot rice, then stir the yolk concoction back into the rice mixture. Mix in half the raisins, then spoon the rice pudding into a decorative 8-inch-square baking dish.

3. **Browning and finishing the pudding:** Preheat the broiler and dot the rice pudding with butter. Set the dish under the heat long enough to brown the top, 3 or 4 minutes. Sprinkle with the remaining raisins and the ground cinnamon, and serve warm or at room temperature.


*Techniques*

**Thickening the Rice:** In Step 2, the mixture should be simmered only until the milk takes on a slight creaminess (it will still look soupy). Overcooking will give you something dense and unapproachable. Should the latter be your fate, stir in a few tablespoons of milk just al youre about to serve, dot with butter and brown again.


*Timing and Advance Preparation*

The rice pudding can be ready in an hour, much of which wont involve your direct participation. It may be prepared through Step 2 a day or two ahead, then buttered and broiled shortly before serving.

*Regional Explorations*

Rice pudding brings to my mind the volatile, chancy crowd of Mexico Citys Garibaldi Square, where this dessert, only one of the attractions, sits in huge, milky masses stuck with a raisin or two for decoration. Or sometimes Im reminded of the well-used walkways around the Oaxacan market, where ladies sell it in paper cups at sundown. Or I picture any of a dozen other typical scenes: from rude, makeshift street stands to well-appointed traditional restaurantswhere arroz con lecbe is the thing you have.

	<TEXT> EXACTLY! Thanks for the reply! ^

Most (if not all) grocery stores (unless privately owned Co-Ops) receive all their produce from the same location. Hints why the UPC codes for produce do not change upon location! This makes express checkouts (self-checkouts) a great thing to use! (Also worked at Dillons in high school so I recall most of the codes....)

Meat providers possibly stay the same, that I do not know. In regards to dairy, well clearly Dillons/Kroger has a different private provider than WalMart - aside from the name-brands that appear in every store: i.e. Silk, Roberts, etc.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Whoa there, being educated wasn't an issue. Before getting the IUD, I had read through a lot before deciding to get it. I know how the ring works, where it is placed, etc. It just surprises me that, even when feeling around, she still missed the ring - when I went in for the month check-up, last Friday! I recall stating to her that I had forgotten to take it out and she said she would before inserting the IUD. Clearly she forgot. 

In response to how long to use it, I was (at the time) wearing the 2nd of a sample pack - and yes it was in the span of 3-weeks. Of course now it has been over a month, with the same ring. Of which I did not know was there to begin with.

I'm not saying it's objectifying in any manner, the fact they used that as a key word in the title makes you wonder if anyone cares about his mental state or more of the fact, who he killed. Why not just refer to her as  Reeva Steenkamp - in the same way why isn't 'athlete' in front of Oscar Pistorius? Model seems to be overused....like it's supposed to hold some significance.  </TEXT>

I do my best not to 'toot' around him, but it's a natural process the body experiences. And hey, we've grown to laugh at the cost of what others would find grotesque and unappealing - in order to not take everything so seriously and to just relax and understand it's a part of life.

	<TEXT> Sauce was a last minute thing. First we tried melting the fresco queso  (with heavy cream) over a double-broiler, but the consistency was still lumpy, grainy, and the sauce had little taste. We decided to add hand-grated swiss cheese and some of the 4-cheese package varieties from Sargento. Even after using a submersion blender, we couldn't get past the graininess. By then we were too hungry to care (well past 8:30 pm central time). Also sprinkled in cumin, red pepper flakes and whatever else my boyfriend happened to slip it. It added a great flavor, but we will be sure to check out a good recipe next time (instead of just winging it). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Basic anatomy of the eye. We clearly evolved to a suitable point, but in retrospect, it's all backwards in how the eye operates.

I have horrible eye-sight and feel this would make a tremendous difference.

Then again, that would require mutations none of us could possibly live to see.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It took 25 years until I found out I was a bit of a b*tch. No one ever mentioned it. This finally came to light when my boyfriend brought it up. Don't take that as a bad thing, it has actually reshaped my life - in a remarkably good way.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Welcome to my hipster side....know what I do? I walk. I know that sounds lame, but if you live in a city that has a lot of hills and views, you're bound to discover things you never imagined. 

You would also be surprised of the artwork often spread throughout cities. While on one of my leisurely strolls last year, I made frequent stops along the way to find hidden graffiti, and other artwork, down the main street in town.

***This though, would require a lot of walking, and that might not be your thing.

	<TEXT> A lot of college towns do not hire college students and, instead, only hire high school aged students within the city - my story for the past 5 years.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I could do without catching the cold, flu, or any virus/disease - period. Eradicating that problem would be superb.  </TEXT>
