	<TEXT> Yeah my first job while I was still studying was as first level support on an IT helpdesk, and clients would ring up and assume that I was the receptionist and when I explained I wasn't and I was there to help them, sometimes they would still ask to speak to 'one of the boys'. I'd have to tell them that they were busy and ask again how I could help them. The guys were more experienced than me but 95-99% of client requests I was able to fix myself. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am a female in IT. I chose this field because I enjoy it, and it turns out I am good at it. I am not concerned about the gender bias because I feel my qualifications and experience speak for themselves, and so far that has been the case (the only time I have been discriminated against it has not affected my career progress). However, I'm relatively inexperienced and I would love to know other people's experiences in similar environments. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I will read, and then if I am feeling energetic still, I will write a list of all the things I have to do the next day, and the thought of that sometimes makes me mentally exhausted and I nod off. Plus if you're like me and think about all your problems, planning out the next day gives you something else to think about besides the problems. I also find that coming on the computer usually makes me stay up longer, so using it right before bed is often not a good idea for me if I'm trying to sleep.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We recently had our headlamps replaced in our Toyota 4WD with some crappy ones when they broke. I don't think they were a genuine part, or they were 2nd hand. We drive about a 6-8hr drive (each way) at least 2 times a year in winter to go down south on highways and so we have to drive part of the way at night usually (cause we are slow getting away). The high beam on the old headlamps was really bad - I nearly hit a few dead kangaroos because of this. We got them replaced again with brand new ones after some scary driving experiences and it was HEAPS better - I could see at least 10 times as far. Didn't need HID lights, and I don't know why anyone really would need them. Definitely recommend replacing with the regular lights first before trying annoying HID lights. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think the gang-rape thing happened once or twice, and it hit newspapers pretty hard. I don't remember it being like a common trend. Most of those guys got decent prison sentences for the really bad rape, but some of them got away pretty lightly. 

The beach thing that happened was really disappointing. I definitely think the media fulled that incident, and I think most of the locals disapproved but there are idiots everywhere and sometimes it only takes a few. I definitely think there was a problem there long before this happened, and I think there still is. I honestly don't know what the solution is. Most of the guys are just stupid teenagers/young adults and are showing off to their friends in the most intolerable ways possible.

	<TEXT> I live in Sydney too. 

I agree about the people being rude. It's amazing how lonely you can feel with so many people around. I live and work in the city, but it is a bit stressful sometimes and I miss the open space that I have at my parents in the suburbs. Even then it's not as nice out there as it used to be, since the bush is now all gone and new housing developments went up when I was a kid. I remember when we used to go to the shopping centre everyone knew each other and we couldn't go through without mum having a million conversations... I used to think grocery shopping took forever... but now I realise we had it good. It's not like that as much anymore. 

Sure there are crowds at big events, but then again you don't have to go if you don't like that sort of thing. There are quite a few jerks around that just don't care about anyone else's experience, so you have to learn a great deal of tolerance and not let it get to you, otherwise you can never enjoy yourself. That said, sometimes it's hard to ignore. I went out to dinner one night (kind of late - 11pm), and saw 3 people throw up in the street while we were walking to the restaurant (in the space of one block). I was kind of glad we were too late to get food from for the restaurant. If you are with a group of friends and can ignore it, the atmosphere can be great (as long as you know the best spot to go). 

With the immigration, I agree there's a problem there in terms of people actively not wanting to be part of Australian society. Obviously I am glad some people have cultural identity, and can feel like they belong somewhere, but so often I feel like some have no respect for any other race or culture aside from their own, and often do try to intimidate you so they can force some sort of feeble excuse for respect from you. It's not like that everywhere in Sydney, and I think you can have a completely different experience and quality of life if you live in a nicer suburb as you suggested. I think that's like a lot of large cities as well, and because I haven't lived anywhere very long term I don't know enough to say that other places are any better. I'd like to think they would be though.

I used to go surfing a bit when I was younger and nowadays I don't like it so much. I used to go to Cronulla (where the riots happened a few years back) quite regularly. I had some problems myself long before that incident. I don't like city beaches much anymore. Especially after finding 3 syringes in the sand on separate occasions. That all said I will still go surfing and for most of the time (not hot ones cause those are the days that attract the idiots), it is a nice place. Advice tho: wear thongs   don't build sandcastles far away from the water's edge cause the rubbish tractors don't clear the edges of the beach very well.  

I used to love Sydney because I thought it had everything - beautiful harbour, beautiful beaches, convenient local area shopping centers, good restaurants, good nightlife, multiculturalism, etc. - but as I get older and see more of Sydney I think sometimes I feel that the things I dislike about it are outweighing the benefits as well. 

I have really mixed feelings about this place, and so often I do feel like I hate it. I definitely want to get out and experience other places as well.

	<TEXT> We were out watching fireworks a few years back and after they end the city goes crazy with drunks everywhere. I saw this girl and guy fighting, after which the guy punches her in the face. Probably cause she is a bit drunk she falls straight from her feet onto her head on the curb, with no arm out or anything. I hear this loud cracking noise as her head hits the curb, and the guy walks off, leaving her with her friend. The girl was probably okay because I heard her screaming and crying after she fell. I saw some police nearby who are stopping people from going on the bridge. I walked up to the first one and explained what happened a few meters away and asked if he could call an ambulance. He explained he was too busy watching the bridge. I walked over to the other cop working with him who was clearly the more senior cop and he called an ambulance. Not blaming the cop they were probably overwhelmed but that was a weird thing to see. </TEXT>

It was decided I would get up there first, she'd pass me the bowl (which I held on my lap), and then she'd get up afterwards, and we could enjoy noodles and trampolining concurrently.

I burnt my whole right upper leg and spent a few weeks sitting down and having this white cooling cream applied to the burns.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The OP annoyed the Twatty guy, who got up in anger and asked the rhetorical question "Do you know who my father is?" as if implying he is a man of great influence or importance, and someone not to be messed with. 

By interpreting the question non-rhetorically you could assume the person really doesn't know who their father is. The OP uses this to offend the Twatty guy by responding with "No. Have you tried asking your mother?" and implying that the mother either slept around or was no longer involved with the father of the Twatty guy.

I'm not great with explanations but hopefully that clears it up. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think some of it is to do with attitude towards a problem. 

The bigger the learning curve the more fear you have I.e. the bigger the perceived 'hardness'.

Sometimes learning something new can be really hard, because you might not have all the necessary background knowledge or know the terminology, and so at first you don't take it in. If you persist with it long enough and get past this point, the result can be really rewarding. 

I sometimes think maybe people have found something hard, began working on it but not persisted long enough to get the reward. So the next time they see a problem, they have an even bigger mental barrier because they didn't feel the satisfaction from last time. If this is a problem, at least for me I found the best thing to do is break it down into parts and then each time you understand a part you will feel a bit better - trying to understand a huge problem in one go can be really demotivating. </TEXT>

I don't consider objecting to someone else smoking as being controlling - more that you care about that person and don't want them to get addicted, waste money or damage their health. In reality, I could never stop him from smoking - he could just do it behind my back - but I did tell him how I felt about it and in the end he made his own decision to quit. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Everyone poops! If you didn't paint her walls with your poop I don't see any problem. Besides that, I guess it's her fault if her walls are so thin she can hear.
 
I can think of a few things you can do though:

A) You can try turning on the tv or radio beforehand if possible. Then just let it rip. Flush it and act like nothing happened. Avoid going near the bathroom for a while.

B) Get her to go to the toilet first and then act subtly disgusted and pretend like it sounded/smelt horrible. Then she'll be so worried about how horrible her poo was she won't even care if yours sounds/smells bad. 

C) Show her how awesome the poo you just did was. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's kind of hard to notice things when you live here cause it happens so slowly when you're here. Here's a few things I can think of off the top of my head:

* The Harbour Bridge and some other places are now cashless. You need one of those e-tags to cross it now. I hate toll roads. 

* Buses around the city require you to have a travel 10 to get on/off buses during peak periods (I think it's 7am-7pm but I can't remember), so you can't pay cash to travel. I think this is probably a good thing but most people who travel regularly get Travel 10s anyway cause they're cheaper. 

* There was some stuff going on with Bikie Gangs which is still happening. They [bludgeoned some guy to death at the domestic terminal](http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/03/30/2530292.htm). 

* The international airport (departure) was getting upgraded and had barely any food in the food court there. It sucks to hang around at before a flight. [Due to finish 2010](http://www.sydneyairport.com.au/sacl/International-Terminal---Expansion-and-Upgrade.html).

* If you're already in Australia this won't make any difference but here anyway - 
[Utility costs have gone up](http://www.switzer.com.au/latest-news/news-stories/record-lift-in-utility-charges-proves-inflation-bogy/): 
Utility charges rose by a record (37 years) 10.2 per cent in the September quarter. Utility charges rose by 13.4 per cent over the year  the biggest increase in 26 years.

* Pitt Street mall is going through an upgrade. Not a very pretty sight at the moment (not that it really was before).

* RTA penalties for speeding have changed a few times now. P platers have zero alcohol limit now, and there are some new anti-hoon laws. 

* More and more school zones have flashing lights now when it is 40km/h

* God damn birds! I used to open my balcony window in the mornings, but the miner birds are trying to nest, and a pair flew into my unit (I'm on the 4th floor), as did a pigeon. Pigeons at least are pretty predictable and so that one just kept flying at the window trying to get out. I caught it with a towel and let it out. Then a few days later some miner birds flew in and were scared shitless of me, so shitless, they shat all over my unit. I had bird poop everywhere. This, along with the time a turkey tried to steal my lunch, now mean I only like some birds.

	<TEXT> From the Telegraph: [link](http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/grant-edward-brown-refused-bail-after-being-charged-with-unprovoked-attack-on-circular-quay-to-manly-ferry/story-e6freuy9-1225798655514)

**Grant Edward Brown refused bail after being charged with unprovoked attack on Circular Quay to Manly ferry**

*November 17, 2009 3:31PM*


A PERSONAL trainer accused of striking a 70-year-old man in the head in a bout of unprovoked violence on a Manly ferry has been refused bail for the protection of the community.

Grant Edward Brown, 31, was charged with recklessly wounding after the incident on the Queenscliff ferry shortly after it left Circular Quay at 6pm yesterday.

Police allege Brown, visiting from Tasmania, struck John Edward Lane once to the face, causing him to fall heavily and his head hit the ground.

Documents tendered to Central Local Court this afternoon have revealed Brown was allegedly talking loudly and aggressively on a telephone shortly before the incident.

To the unknown person on the phone, Brown allegedly said: If someone on this ferry gets their head punched in, it will be on you.

A short time later, he was allegedly acting aggressively, kicking walls and bins before a companion of Mr Lanes then alleged approached him and told him to calm down.

He refused, threatening to bash your head in.

When Mr Lane then interjected urging him to relax as well, he was told: Step away, I swear Im going to punch your f***ing head in.

He then allegedly struck Mr Lane with a closed fist, causing the victim to fall to the ground and strike his head on the deck.

Witnesses have told police of seeing a large amount of blood and then hearing the accused man become hysterical: Someone help him, someone help him.

Magistrate Allan Moore refused the Tasmanian bail, saying he was not satisfied that the community would be safe if he was released to bail.

The case will be re-mentioned on Friday.

I also only recently learned you have to tip in Canada too. I thought they had the same system as Australia.

	<TEXT> My uncle went on the Queen Elizabeth II cruise ship and it was all you can eat all the time. He said there were some americans that had the following meals (each with a full buffet style serving):

* Breakfast

* Morning Tea

* Brunch

* Lunch

* Afternoon Tea

* Dinner (Entres included)

* Dessert

* Supper

When they docked they didn't have enough time to unload all the human waste - there were trucks lining up to take away the sewerage, so the ship left with still plenty of gunk on board.

He is not young (75+) and he said they were the fattest people he'd seen in his life. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I get the train and the bus, and I don't like public transport because:

* It's expensive

* It's slow

* If the buses fills up they don't stop to let passengers on. So you can't rely on it to get you somewhere on time. The next bus might not be for another 20 minutes.

* Has sick people spreading their illnesses

* It's uncomfortable and crowded - sometimes I can't get a seat and have to stand up, and sometimes I get squished by someone, I also do my groceries and have to carry them on my lap because someone decided to sit next to me with all my groceries instead of one of the other free chairs.

* It's dirty - people always leave their rubbish on the train, especially the later ones after peak hour.

* Bad experiences - a guy once jerked off next to me on the train.


I still catch public transport only because

* It's still slightly cheaper than driving

* The train can be faster than driving in peak hour

I sometimes stay near work and just walk to work, but it is 4km over fairly hilly terrain and can be a little tiring after a long work day, and not that safe. </TEXT>
