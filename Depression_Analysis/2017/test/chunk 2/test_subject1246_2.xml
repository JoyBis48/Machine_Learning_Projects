	<TITLE> Do you have a college degree or higher in science? Get flair indicating your expertise in /r/science! </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-08-09 03:40:38 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> ##**Science Verified User Program**

/r/science has a a system of verifying accounts for commenting, enabling trained scientists, doctors and engineers to make credible comments in /r/science . The intent of this program is to enable the general public to distinguish between an educated opinion and a random comment without a background related to the topic. 


#**What flair is available?**

All of the standard science disciplines would be represented, matching those in the sidebar.
However, to better inform the public, the level of education is displayed in the flair too. For example, a Professor of biology is tagged as such (Professor- Biology), while a graduate student of biology is tagged as "Grad Student-Biology." Nurses would be tagged differently than doctors, etc...

The general format is:

Level of education|Field|Speciality or Subfield (optional)

When applying for a flair, please inform us on what you want it to say.

#**How does one obtain flair?**


First, have a college degree or higher in a field that has flair available.
Then send proof to the mods of /r/science .

This can be provided several ways:

1) Message the mods with information that establishes your claim, this can be a photo of your diploma or course registration, a business card, a verifiable email address, or some other identification. All submissions will be kept in confidence and not released to the public under any circumstances. You can submit an imgur link and then delete it after verification. 

Remember, that within the proof, you must tie your account name to the information in the picture.


2) if you aren't comfortable messaging the mods with identifying information, you can directly message any individual mod and supply the information to them. Again, your information will be held in confidence.


3) Send an email with your information to sciencereddit@gmail.com after messaging the mods to inform them of this option. Your email will then be deleted after verification, leaving no record. 

This is convenient if you want to take a photo of your identification and email from a smart phone, for example.

Edit:  Hi.  We're getting flooded with requests, we're adding people as fast as we can, if we miss you somehow, we apologize, if you don't see your flair or get a response in the next two days, message us again.

Thanks for making /r/science a better place!
