	<TEXT> Yea, you hit upon several of my assumptions, especially the fact that she's likely to associate certain feeling of guilt with me no matter what.  So we'll see how it goes.  She's not the first girlfriend I've had an abusive childhood.  They always say they feel safe with me. </TEXT>

Just thought some of you might be curious as to what happened after my post.  After it seemed nothing else would help her feel better about what happened, she decided to use a counseling service through the university where she's working on her PhD.  (since it's a free service)  After a few weeks, the sessions began unearthing dormant issues of molestation and other terrible things from her childhood which the counselors are convinced are the reasons she has these debilitating feelings of guilt and shattered trust.  I encouraged her to focus on those issues without worrying about our relationship and we ended up going on a break.  I had suspected there might be something akin to molestation in her history, but I never brought it up.  Hopefully more counseling will help.

	<TEXT> Ha, confidence and swagger seem to be aphrodisiacs, yes.  I'm not worried about women who hit on me when they know I have a girlfriend.  I can swat away flies.  Just looking for ideas on how to make a shy girl feel less embarrassed. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yea, but just a few of them.  And honestly, the ones that I couldn't understand why she was friends with.  Mostly girls from her high school days who she doesn't hang out with much anymore (or any now). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> She was actually very proactive initially, messaging everyone trying to be light-hearted and underscoring that what she said was a secret just amongst friends, then I started getting messages from girls that weren't there. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The women that were forward with me would generally be the ones I assumed would be cheaters.  The ones that seems a little bit more selfish, narcissistic, and impulsive than the others.  Also virtually all of them already had significant others. Not a fantasy to have my girlfriend consider ending the relationship because of embarrassment. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I appreciate your words.  She lives off my reassurance, but the problem is she has to think about it every time we're intimate since my manhood reminds her of her guilt and mistrust in her friends. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yea, I'm confident things will return to a healthier level of comfort eventually.  I believe it also has much to do with how her public and private lives collided.  She feels exposed.  Just trying to see if there are other shy girls out there who can see things from her perspective and offer some ideas on what might help her see things less negatively.  (and also help her not be so PTSD-esque when she's being intimate with my manhood.  it stirs up memories of feeling betrayed by her friends) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's actually a reoccurring problem.  Previous friends of previous girlfriends have tried to get me to have sex with them.  (Unsuccessfully.)  And the reverse has definitely happened a few times where male friends of mine (who obviously aren't friends of mine anymore) tried to get my then girlfriend to sleep with them.  It always seems to start with Facebook.  A friend of my girlfriend will friend me and occasionally IM me to see what's going on and start getting really chatty and friendly.  Perhaps I shouldn't list Secretary as one of my favorite films.  That seems to give them an icebreaker. </TEXT>
