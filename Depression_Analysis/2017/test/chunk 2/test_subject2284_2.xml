	<TEXT> Nui uses Female bathrooms, has a female voice, wears a dress, has been depicted nude, has breasts, has a favourite colour of pink, describes herself as female... I could go on. What does the series gain from this twist? Absolutely nothing, there's no male NUI subtext, there's no context, it would just piss people off. Face facts, you theory just doesn't work. You can write a fanfiction about it, but it will never, **ever** be canon. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> My Comprehensive plan for Anime life after kill la kill </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-03-30 01:27:34 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So, since I don't have any Kill la kill episodes to wait all week for, I've decided to develop a comprehensive schedule for myself for life after Kill la kill


Monday: Madoka Magicka: Looks like a pretty sweet little magical girl series, should be fun!


Tuesday:Attack on Titan: Continues action and mild apocalyptic/fantasy flavor of kill la kill, also highly critically acclaimed


Wednesday: Claymore: The first anime I ever watched, so I'm watching it again. Continues action girl, dark elements of kill la kill


Thursday: Bakenmonogatari: Highly acclaimed, anime I'm personally interested in


Friday: gurren lagaan: A nice anime to round out my Friday, nice to get some hype for my weekend


Saturday: Space Dandy: Basically my saturday night comedy


Sunday: Sakura trick: Heard good things. I also want to create maximum contrast with madoka mondays


Basically, I want to watch acclaimed anime every day, but from every end of the spectrum, from light to dark, any comments/advice? </TEXT>

There's literally no evidence for it, it's not a theory, it's fanfiction, that's not a bad thing, but  there is not a single thing in dialogue or imagery to indicate Nui being male other than Nui not being overly sexualized (and NUI's distaff counterpart, Mako, wasn't either, and we know she's not a boy). **Even if** it was a twist for the OVA or word of God, everyone would say it's bullshit, because there has been no foreshadowing. </TEXT>

(presumably, in my opinion, the 'date' isn't shown in the epilogue, as it's obviously set way after the ending, whereas the dialogue implied that the 'date' would be a more immediate, spontaneous thing)  The ending will still ultimately, be ambiguous, and I actually think that's a bit gutless, but oh well. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> The use of the word 'Date' in regards to translation from Japanese </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-03-29 00:31:34 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I was wondering if the use of the word 'date' has the same connotations in Japan as it does elsewhere, as I think it would be helpful to know if it had an odd translation in the sub, or some hidden cultural meaning or whatever.

Basically, I would like discuss, from a purely rational perspective, whether the ending actually confirms ANYTHING about the shipping war stuff, or at least stop people from assuming that the term 'date' was used in a platonic sense from the get-go.

	<TEXT> Mako has shown no romantic feeling for Gamagoori, and there's the fact that the Mako is the only person capable of cooling down ryuko from brainwashing, and Ryuko keeps talking in anticipation of the date in the finale... and there's the kissing stuff, and the nosebleeds in earlier episodes, and the fact there is no canon confirmation of Gamagoori's LOVE for mako.

I don't think still supporting the Makogoori ship is unjustified, but saying it's the only canon ship is ludicrous,and there was no need to make that derogatory comment, I'm simply saying that if characters specifically talking about a DATE, they might be talking about, y'know, a date.

Im simply arguing from a state of rationality, I'm not shipping anyone, I'm simply stating that I think there's more evidence for the Mako Ryuko stuff than to the contrary, but neither has ultimately being exclusively confirmed. </TEXT>

Those people who you see as watching 'reality TV' may actually be watching breaking bad or some other great show, but you misbrand it as something you hate whilst they brand anime as the 'naughty tentacles.' You can't expect people to culturally accept your media when you don't accept theirs. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Now, I don't usually get involved in shipping of any kind, but Kill la Kill has really fascinated with the potentiality for the the climax to literally go anywhere with character relationships.

The points of contention seem to be around two fairly recent plot developments:

1. The Mako Gamagoori hinted romance/ship, I don't think a lot of people saw this coming. Usually, ships are speculation based, particularly the Yuri or unlikely ships, however, the Mako/Ryuko ship seemed increasingly likely, with frequent references (such as the nosebleed) however, after aorund episode 12, suddenly this changed, and the fanbase latched on to the Gamagoori/ Mako ship, particularly as Ryuko started to lose some audience sympathy at this point. I think it's very interesting that Mako has two potential love interests yet they're both equally 'unorthodox' (it would be a gutsy move to make the protagonist a lesbian, but also a gutsy move to deny how it thematically makes sense, as well as the shipping and fanservice angle that is played up fairly heavily on the show.)

2. The sinking of the Satsuki/Ryuko ship. Although some people still struggle along with the incest angle, It's almost certain nothing will come of this. Which leaves us with a problem: If Mako goes with Gamogoori, Ryuko really wouldn't have any love interest that she's significantly invested in, furthermore Satsuki is now almost certainly not going to have a love interest of any kind.

Therefore, I ask a question to you fellow redditors, what, from a story perspective, is most likely to happen in terms of these relationships? Will Trigger go for the gutsy move of a lesbian main character, or will they choose to pair up only Mako and maybe a few elite four/ nudist beach members? Or maybe nobody at all? I welcome the discussion. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This has been speculated upon, but personally I doubt it, If Isshin was in disguise, he would have blown it when everybody were pulling the aces from their sleeves. Furthermore, even if he was in disguise, Ragyo must have hired a random girl, who only existed six months ago, to be her assistant, then told her all her super top secret plans, all with no prerogative. It may happen, but I think it would be bad writing if they don't give a VERY complicated explanation. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Rei Hououmaru,what's her angle? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-03-12 00:38:04 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> OK, So I just finished a marathon run of the Anime this weekend, and I'm super excited for the next few episodes, but I think one character is being potentially overlooked,Rei Hououmaru, Ragyo's assistant. I believe she will have some vital importance to the climax due to a few key factors.


1. She's the **very young** assistant of the main antagonist of the series, an antagonist that's shown to be extremely take no prisoners, psychopathic and condescending. The only other person in Ragyo's triad is Nui, one of the most powerful characters on the show, why would she have an assistant with no special abilities or no master plan in mind?
2. Rei is shown constantly in shots, including the titles sequence, she was also not unimportant enough to be offered to the covers, she must be kept alive for something
3. If you had a final trump card like Ragyo surely does, you wouldn't want to hide it in a secret base that could get hacked, or use it so openly in combat like with Nui, you would hide it in plain sight, slightly blurred and out of focus, just like Rei. Therefore, I posit a theory: The new outfit being made by Nui isn't for Ryuko or Ragyo, it's for Rei, the person under her absolute control and power, kept following around on a leash. I predict Rei will do something in the climax that openly makes us go WHAT THE FUCK? Like so many of the twists so far.


Anyway, I'm open for discussion and contradiction, so fire away! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey sips, this may be COMPLETELY out of leftfield, but how about Earthbound? It's generally seen as one of the best JRPG'S ever made, is all about American values, is nostalgic because it was around in your childhood, and is quietly weird without being in your face like South park. (Although Earthbound was inspiration for the new South park game) If you've already played Earthbound, I'll suggest something even MORE radical [Mother 3](http://mother3.fobby.net/), the sequel to Earthbound, which was made in 2006, and, thanks to the glories of fan translation, can now be played in the west. Mother 3 is generally regarded as a narrative masterpiece, humourous yet incredibly touching. (many people have said it made them cry) I know it's a big undertaking, but I gaurantee you'll be hooked by the end of the first chapter of Mother 3 </TEXT>
