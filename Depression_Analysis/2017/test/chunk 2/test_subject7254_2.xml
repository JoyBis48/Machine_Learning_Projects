	<TEXT> Anthropomorphic global warming is a farce and a political movement to undermine Western capitalist nations.

Devastating periods of climate activity are going to happen, with or without humans present. Consider the ice ages. Glaciers several kilometers thick formed and moved thousands of miles, crushing everything in their paths. There is no scientist on earth that can tell you why this occurred.  There were several interglacial periods of warming, where ice was rapidly melting.   We are probably in one of those periods now.  


Even the founder of Greenpeace stated before Congress there is no scientific evidence of anthropomorphic global warming.   

Relax, the sky's not falling. We don't need more govt control to avert another fake crisis. Sound familiar? </TEXT>

You know what's not fair?

Most low to medium income people don't understand this because they pay little, none or even negative tax.
