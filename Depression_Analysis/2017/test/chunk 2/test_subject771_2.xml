I heard a "WUNK" on my roof, so I backed off, (what the fuck was that?) then I hear the plane again, and it touches down. 

 HOLY SHIT!  DOWNSHIFT!  DROP THE CLUTCH, NEURAL! 911!  OH FUCK  I'M GONNA KILL THIS GUY!  OH SHIT!  I stopped 30 yards back.  Then I'm on the phone after I see if the guy is still alive.  Scary shit!  STAY NEXT TO THE PLANE!  STAY STILL!  Turns out he ran out of gas, and had to land, so he just went for the nearest highway, and he accidently tried landing on me.  After he hit my roof, he took another pass, (faster), and landed ahead.  WTF?

	<TEXT> Since tasers are LTL options, (like I as a civillian have the option of pommelling you with my knife, or turning it around and spearing you with it, and after that drawing a gun and stopping you), but if I pommeled a person to stop a threat, (Ideally I don't want to get that close if I have to use it), I would be arrested if I hit somebody in the temple and accidently killed them even if it was self-defense.  Then released because if I'm drawing a weapon and was using proper escalation of force, then no charges filed in WA state).

But what happens if a cop pulls a taser, uses it, and the guy drops dead?  Would an investigation occur?  I personally won't pull anything on anybody unless I intend on using it, and am pretty sure I might have to. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Back in 2010, I was shooting off fireworks, (arieals), next to a gas station, and after I lit it, I ran my ass off incase something went wrong. After running for a while, I turned around and started running backwards looking at the thing I just torched off, Why did he do that? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-04-07 05:51:59 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Then a police officer grabs me, (one hand on my shoulder, and one hand on my right hand to restrain me).  Why did he do that?  I spun around and was about ready to deck the guy because I though somebody was going to rob me, but I stopped once I recognized that it's a cop, and not somebody going to rob/assault me.  So why did he feel the need to mildly restrain me, to risk getting punched in the face?  

Once I saw it was a city officer, I stood down, but I thought it was some random dude trying to stop me from getting away from the several mortars about ready to shoot off.  He should have shouted over his bull horn, eh?

He asked me if I owned this road, and told him "no, but nobody else is using it eh?  so I'm setting off fireworks."  He stood there and watched the fireworks with me, then ran my background info, then told me not to set off fireworks in a public roadway.

  Then he told me to pack up my shit and go to the parking lot if I'm intent on setting off fireworks, so I did.  He shook his head, and took off. </TEXT>

Is that a thing, or am I paranoid?  No, I wasn't drinking, Just nobody was there, so I pulled into the left lane.  I got let off and basically told "don't do that", then sent on my merry way.  This just happened, if it helps. </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2015-04-04 13:47:49 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> While driving down the road, how do police decide to not stop somebody going VERY FAST (2-3 times the speed limit, running lights (reasonably safely, but emergently) , and blaring his horn and having on the 4 ways while flashing his high beams), Is it because he's on the phone to 911 and talking to dispatch as it happens "live", or some other reason?

When my wife cut her hand on a stupid-ass soup can, I was honestly faster than the ambulance, so "get in my truck and buckle up.  We're hauling ass".  After she got in my rig, I went 65 through town through 20 zones, and police actually got out of my way.  

I was heading the most direct rout for the hospital that I possibly could, and had my 4 ways on and was jumping lights.  I think it was pretty damned obvious that it was an emergency, ( I normally don't drive like that,  eh?)  But they knew to get out of my way and close down intersections somehow.  Is it because I was on the phone to dispatch ( 911 ), while I was rushing to the hospital as fast as I felt safe going?  

No, I didn't jump lights if it was unsafe, but if there was a gap, I did the left, right forward?  CLEAR  thing?  While I ran several lights, and wouldn't have stopped until the hospital, (then surrendered, because somebody bleeding to death on me), everybody (including several emgergency vehicles were just getting out of my way.  About half way there, I got a lead rig and a pilot rig.  How did they know that I needed a police escort when all I gave on the phone was present location, description of the vehicle, license plate number, and direction of heading?  How the fuck did the cops know not to stop me, clear the roads, and take me to the hospital? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> How does one adopt non-local vernacular?  I've adopted several sayings, and I honestly have no clue where I got them from.  I'm a native to Eastern WA, (Whitman County).  I've managed to pick up the following words and I don't know how or why:

Buggy = "shopping cart"

Y'all = "You all / you guys / you"

Eh? = "Huh? / what? / right? / yeah?"

Sup = "What's up?"

Pillock = "Dick"

Arse = "ass"

Thank god I didn't adopt "cunt", or "hoser", eh? 

Sorry if this a "shit post", (whatever the hell that is), but I don't know where else to ask this.

And why don't people know what a buggy is?  I don't get it.  "shopping cart" now sounds dumb to me. </TEXT>

He was talking about how much shit he can fit in his buggy, and I was getting confused, so I said "buggy?  you mean that thing that you do this with in stores?", (did the buggy shoving gesture).

Also, is it a good idea to inform, even though I don't have to?  I got in a collision back in 2012, and an officer responded.  After asking for DL/reg/ins, 

I gave him all the paperwork, and also gave him my CPL, and told him that "Since I'm armed today, here is my CPL."  He just looked at it, asked me where it as, and said "cool, if you don't touch yours, I won't touch mine."  I didn't care, but I felt like I should inform the officer even if I legally don't have to. </TEXT>

MS should transition to USB installation.  Installing W10 with a DVD is the first time I've even used that drive since 2010. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I tried to replace the front glass, (not very sucessfull).  I got the front glass off, but the LCD was still stuck to the screen, even after heating it up with a hair dryer.  at first, none of the buttons except for power and volUp and VolDn were working, so I took apart the phone completly, (MB, and screen/bezel assembly as one unit) and noticed that a connecter came loose on the touch screen link to the lower buttons.  

I got the home, menu, and back buttons to work again, but I still can't use the touch screen at all.  It simply doesn't recognize input.  Is there a way to fix the touch screen?  It displays everything fine, but input via touch is now impossible.  Is there a connecter that I may have missed?  I would like to not spend $71 if I don't have to buy a new front screen/bezel assembly.

**EDIT:**  Well, now that I tore it apart again, and put it back together, the phone won't turn on at all.  :(  Fuck.  Now it looks like I'm going to have to buy one. :(  I'm now back to my backup phone, which is a i997 flashed with CM11 (unofficial) 4.4.4.  Do you think I EMPed it by accident? Even plugging it in, it won't signify charging at all. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Example:  We got in WWII because of the Jewish holocaust.

No, we didn't.  We didn't even recognize them until 1943, when the war machine was starting to lose support, so it was revealed to the American public about execution camps, so we must fight the evil. The USA actually turned back Jewish refugees in 1938, because we didn't want them either.  (Source:  http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005267 ) 

We REALLY got involve in WWII because we embargoed the japs for oil, so we got struck in the territory of HI, so we declared war on them.  Then, since JP was allied with GE, they declared war on us.  Boom!  WWII.  The rest is history as we know it.

Anyhow, how do these modern propaganda stories get passed down as fact, when they are incredibly wrong, and why do people believe it, when even a modicum of research would prove it wrong? </TEXT>
