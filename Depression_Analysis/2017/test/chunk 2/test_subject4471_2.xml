	<TEXT> There is no proof he received calls at work. Furthermore, the only thing "doxxed" was his dating profile which NITESMOKE PUT UP HIMSELF. 

He acted in a childish, stupid manner, bullied people, and we all know he called people fags on this very sub. Yet here he is as this social justice champion. Funny how he suddenly becomes a White Knight when he's the one being attacked?

He's a compulsive liar, don't listen to anything he says. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would be very wary of anything Nitesmoke is telling us. First, he comes out as some social justice champion for LGBT rights. What? That shit is completely unrelated.

Second, he's changed his story multiple times to cover up his own childish behavior. He couldn't play WoW for a couple days and had a suck attack. That's the whole story. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> He wants to pass blame for having a completely over-the-top, inappropriate and childish reaction to "Wah, I cannot play WoW."

Instead of owning up to his actions, he jumped on the hot-button issue of today (LGBT rights) and became a SJW in a short paragraph of bullshit.

In the words of a famous Blizzard dev: Fuck that loser. </TEXT>

If the 4GB version works with the 2GB version (my current card), I can take one of those instead.

EDIT: ~~Bought one from /u/brictop~~ Scammer

EDIT2: Did some research AFTER I sent brictop money. Turns out he is likely a scammer. Called Visa and Paypal. Both said they'll get me a chargeback if I don't get the card in 2 weeks (standard shipping speed). Just a warning for others out there buying from this guy, use caution. Don't be like me and take people's word at face value. I'm just thankful I will be able to get money back. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> FYI to anyone considering purchasing the account - Blizzard is VERY on the ball when it comes to account trading. They WILL track your IP address, password changes, etc. to the account and will give a temporary suspension, without warning, if they suspect the account was traded (which is against the ToS). It has happened to me twice and I would be very cautious when trading any Blizzard account.

I have traded accounts like elite dangerous and eve online in the past, but they do not go to the extraordinary lengths Blizzard goes through to stop account trading. You've been warned. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am a Christian and one of the last duties Christ gave was for us to go out into the world, preach the gospel and baptize people in the name of the Son/Father/Holy Ghost.

But the way these street preachers "spread God's Word*" is not the best way to go about doing that imo.

I won't go into it much since this isn't /r/christianity, but basically Christians should follow like Jesus did - he performed miracles, signs and aided people *then* followed up with his message as people inevitably asked questions. Most of the stories or parables in the Gospel are told *after* someone comes up and asks Jesus "Hey, Rabbi, why should I do y or how do I do x?" I never recall Matthew 45:16 "Then the Son of God went out into Los Angeles and held up a sign and preached to all the sinful nerds and they were saved that day."

*Funnily enough, most people think "God's Word" is the Bible. In Islam, God's Word is a physical book (the Quran), while in Christianity, God's Word is Jesus himself. The Bible wasn't even completed and compiled yet when John 1:1 was written...

	<TEXT> I think you are being a tad extreme. This is an internet forum where we're all anonymous. I don't equate these discussions to persecution of the early Christians.

I was simply raising the point that this sub seems to downvote unpopular beliefs, despite said beliefs being grounded in scripture. A good sub should upvote any post worthy of proper discussion, regardless of one's opinion or worldview. </TEXT>
