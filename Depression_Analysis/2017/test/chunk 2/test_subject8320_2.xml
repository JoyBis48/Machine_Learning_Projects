	<TEXT> Recently I downloaded VLC media player off a bad site and it screwed with internet explorer and chrome (slower then normal and pop-ups). I was able to find where the junk files installed and deleted the file and completely cleared my browser cash but chrome is still running slow and while it happens a lot less then before I'm still getting pop-ups. Virus scans show nothing (windows defender) (I don't know my specs from memory so I will update this later if need be). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hello everyone! you may remember me as the guy who asked for euphoric hardstyle needed in a [mix for a school talent show](http://www.reddit.com/r/hardstyle/comments/2itn3g/a_call_to_everyone/), well here's an update. Me and my friend decided to do our own things for the talent show, it was after that I got to thinking "why just show people hardstyle when there's a whole genre of music (Hard Dance) I could expose them too". So after some work I have made a mix and a power point, I'm going to do a live mix while projecting the power point behind me. Each slide will have the genre of the current song, facts and what song is currently playing. This is where you guys come in, [heres a link to the mix](https://soundcloud.com/infernal-imp/hard-dance-lession) [and heres a link to the PP](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-dST9JfmygNvSEaYppJVyBqe36W_bYfXJMalfE6xZjU/edit?usp=sharing), I've made it so you guys can leave notes on the PP in case I got any facts wrong. Thanks in advance :)  </TEXT>
