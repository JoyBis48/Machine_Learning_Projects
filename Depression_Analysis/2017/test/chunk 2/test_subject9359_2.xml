	<TEXT> thank you for the advice and support. i do want to be with him for as long as possible in my life because i love him loads. he supports my problems as i take antidepressants as well but I've never had a decrease in libido. i will talk to him about a sex therapist. we can think about exploring new things to do. i do get quite upset when he can't make me orgasm but that is rare. i give him direction in what i like but i think the problem is also that he hasn't tried anything in terms of sexual experience and experiments. i have in the past done sex acts outside of the bedroom and in the public but he hasn't so that is something we can do together. maybe get a new sex toy purchase.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> that is the dose that works for him but not sexually. i think he's going to try and lower it and take something else as well so he doesn't feel as bad  </TEXT>
