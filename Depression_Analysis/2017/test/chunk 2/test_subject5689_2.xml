	<TEXT> This happened a few days ago. I'm re-posting for weekend rules because this got deleted the first time. At the time I wrote this, it was around 3am. Normally at that time, I'm sleeping peacefully in my bed, but I couldn't sleep anymore because of the levels of adrenaline in my bloodstream. My fingers were literally shaking as I wrote this. The rest of the story is unchanged from when I wrote it, so when I say 'tonight' I mean the night that it happened, etc.

As a little bit of background, I normally go to sleep around 10 or 11pm and my wife comes to bed much later, around 2am. Tonight I guess I heard her starting to come to bed and it woke me up. I realized my bladder was full, and right as my tired brain was making the decision to get out of bed I heard the toilet flush. All I thought was 'Great, now it's available!' so I got up. I wanted to expend as little energy as possible so that it would be easy to get back to sleep, so I was walking towards the door in our bedroom when it opened suddenly. All I see on the other side of the door is this bright light which makes me squint and stop in my tracks. My wife, who didn't hear me get up, only sees someone standing right inside the door when she didn't expect anyone to be there. She sees this figure standing there with its arms completely at its sides, totally still, and eyes appearing to be closed. It was at this moment that her brain broke (or rather worked as it's intended to).

She initially stepped back a little, mouth open, arms tucking in, gasping slightly, and then she went full on panic mode and started screaming. She yelled my name three times, each one louder than the last, while recoiling in horror at the sight of someone creepily waiting for her. While she was yelling, I still didn't know quite what was going on, only that I was still extremely sleepy and that I wanted to expend little to no energy so that I could just go to the bathroom and get back to sleep. This changed quickly as I saw her scream into her hands and collapse onto the floor, crying and hyperventilating. She later told me that she didn't collapse until she recognized the stranger in her house was her husband.

I thought she would calm down rather quickly. It didn't happen that way though. She must have used up all her fight or flight instinct for the next 50 years, because she was just shaking and crying and breathing erratically for several minutes. She described it as her brain recognizing that everything is ok, but her body was still in full-blown panic. Meanwhile, I was holding her and apologizing, telling her that it was me and that it was ok, I wasn't going to murder her. Around then she said 'You scared the shit out of me! ...NOT LITERALLY!"

I still really had to go to the bathroom and I was scared that I would literally pee on her, so I left her for a second to go take care of business. Our dog recognized that something was not right and came up to my wife the way she greets us when we come home, with her head low, ears back, and wiggling. She nuzzled my wife with her nose and anytime she stopped getting petted she put her paw on my wife's arm. She's currently still on the bed even though she normally chooses to sleep downstairs.

After things had calmed down a bit, we had to talk to each other to figure out exactly what happened. I told her I wasn't trying to induce a full-blown panic attack, or even scare her a little. I was just sleepy and needed to pee. Now we're both coming down from adrenaline highs, and neither of us is going to be able to sleep for awhile. My wife says she now knows how people feel right before they're murdered.

TL; DR- Went to go to the bathroom, almost ended up with poop everywhere. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't remember, but it was over 5 years ago. They were prescription meds given to us by the vet. As far as the dosage, we would only give him a fraction of a pill. They didn't really stop his car sickness, and in addition to being covered in drool he was cross-eyed, lethargic, and it took too long to wear off. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We used to give him meds, but he was always so loopy afterwards that we discontinued it. He's actually gotten quite a bit better. He's kinda drooly for about a half hour and then he stops and settles in. We also stop feeding him the night before big trips which helps, but we give him food after he stops drooling and he does ok. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's beautiful. I made the same choice, and regretted it only until I found that through my job I was able to live my dreams without being burdened by them. </TEXT>
