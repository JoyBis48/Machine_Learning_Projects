	<TEXT> I do like the warped vocals of Ocean Man, and some of their songs aren't too appealing. I would suggest [Mutilated Lips] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzIHkFJnLbc) if you haven't heard it </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I personally haven't seen much *hate*, more of just people wanting Surf and getting frustrated. No one on this Subreddit could hate Chance really. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> [Music] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs926AIL-ck)

One of my favourite songs off "The Mollusk" that was released in 1997. And yes, I did find them off of the Spongebob Movie. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm interpreting the line "Donnie Trumpet and the Social Experiment are gearing up to drop their debut album, *Surf*, this week featuring Chance the Rapper." as in that they are gearing up this week for the release. Not that they are *releasing* Surf this week, but that they are *preparing* for the drop. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Considering neither #10Day nor Acid Rap were on vinyl, I would assume that the answer is no (rather sadly, might I add). However, this *is technically* Donnie's project that Chance has a big part in. So, we won't know until it happens. </TEXT>
