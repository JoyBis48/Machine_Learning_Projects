	<TEXT> They would make a considerable amount of money buy releasing an official season pass to watch the race live on their site or through various media devices e.g game consoles (ps4/3, xbox one/360), apple tv etc. Have various camera angles that you can choose from and show stats etc on the side. That would be my dream.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Usually in engine cutscenes are of a higher resolution and polygon count when making the game and with the last generation of consoles (360,PS3) you would notice that the characters and environment etc would look a lot better than when you are actually playing the game. With the new consoles (PS4,XONE) this is not really an issue and they can get the game to look as good as its in game cutscenes. Hence why even though the trailer didn't show any true gameplay we can safely assume the game would look like that come release.  </TEXT>

His house was built in the 80s though so that street has old but massive houses which all border a fairly dense forest.

	<TEXT> Australian citizen here, Jeep Cherokee's have always been quite popular here and I have also seen quite a few Chrysler 200's around. While the most common car you see here is a Holden Commodore (Chevy SS). Importing a Mustang, Corvette, Viper or Camaro is uber expensive as you have to get a RHD conversion and I imagine servicing the car would be stupidly expensive. Personally I love the designs of all 3 of those cars, it's just a shame they are so expensive.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I use Xbox Music on my Surface Pro 2 and while I also have my entire iTunes library on the computer I mainly use it because the UI is a lot better + you can import your entire iTunes library into Xbox Music (at least on the sufrace). It pretty much functions like Spotify so I am just on the free account which lets me listen to pretty much anything except their are ads of course.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I wouldn't mind seeing some of the themes the Clone Wars explored, mainly being that grey area of dark and light. It raised very valid points about the Jedi order being power hungry and controlling in their own way. I think Knights of the Old Republic explored these themes extremely well through the character of Kreia. It made you look at the force in shades of gray rather than just pure black and white. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Supposedly the on hiatus/cancelled? tv show Star Wars Underworld was going to be based around a criminal underworld.

"Basically, it is like 'The Godfather'; its the Empire slowly building up its power base around the galaxy, what happens in Coruscant, which is the major capital, and its  about a group of underground bosses who live there and control drugs, prostitution..."

	<TEXT> Here's an [album](http://imgur.com/a/cNgMg) which contains screenshots  from GPU-Z and the catalyst control center which show the temperatures.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So my specs are:

CPU: i7 2600k 3.4ghz (not overclocked)
GPU: AMD Sapphire 6970 2gb (not overclocked)
HDD: Samsung SpinPoint F3 1TB HD103SJ	
PSU: Silverstone Strider Plus 600W ST60F-P	
MOBO: ASRock Z68 Extreme3 Gen3 Motherboard	
OS: Windows 7 Home Premium
RAM: G.Skill Ripjaws F3-12800CL9D-8GBRL 8GB (2x4GB) DDR3	

So basically everything was running fine until yesterday I decided to play some Titanfall then maybe a minute into the game the fan on my GPU went into overdrive it sounded like a jet engine. It has been doing it ever since now when I turn it on it goes into full overdrive and stays like that, GPU-Z said the fan was at 100% and the temperature was at -165 celsius, so something is defintely not right. Any help on what's going on would be much appreciated. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Maybe this had already been pointed out but I noticed it for the first time at lest. In the Phantom Pain trailers where Snake is in the hospital it appears he is a lot skinnier and has lost a lot of muscle as a result of being in a coma and not being able to work out obviously. Just a small but nice detail that adds a lot to the character I think! </TEXT>
