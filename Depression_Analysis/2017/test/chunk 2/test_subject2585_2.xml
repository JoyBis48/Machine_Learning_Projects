	<TEXT> I always struggled with not being able to touch myself! It did get worse with a full bladder, and also if I read anything or watched anything was sexual content. The ache would be there, unless I completely forgot about it by doing something else. I'd take photos of myself to please my OH and make him aroused. 

Also, cumming without touching is a very tricky skill that needs to mastered!

Good luck! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Elastic bands tied around the nipple for a short time, careful not to leave on for too long due to blood circulation.

Nipple suckers, try getting some suction cups and then play with them when suctioned, should be ultra sensitive. 

or if you are my adventurous, buy a milking machine and have your partner milk them! ;)  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My partner (23 M) and I (18 F) have been together for 6 months, I am experienced with BDSM and have been for a long time, unfortunately the bdsm I experienced was mixed with abuse and so this does cause problems with kinks..My partner would like to experience things such as threesomes and having someone watch us, however I have bad experience with both of these and so am not so into trying them again. I feel by saying no, I am taking away his kink and I feel guilty for doing so. Does anyone have any advice for overcoming fears caused by bad experiences?

Thanks.  </TEXT>
