	<TEXT> I've had similar things happen to me. It's strange that you mention swimming lessons. I used to dread going to my swimming lessons when I was young (for some unknown reason). I remember a specific instance when I got into an argument with my parents because they forced me to go when I didn't want to. The phone then rang a couple minutes later saying the lesson was cancelled. As you said, these feelings passed as I grew up and became more confident.  </TEXT>
