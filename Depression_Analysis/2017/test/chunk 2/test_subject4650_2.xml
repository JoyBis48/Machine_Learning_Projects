You know, looking back on it, there were some great dunks but the competition itself has always been a joke. Nique's two handed windmill with his head over the rim scores 45 and Jordan gets a 50 for the same dunk he did in the semi round? C'mooonnnn. As a kid this was a really huge thing, but looking at it now, I kind of understand why the name players wouldn't bother with it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I feel like the Hawks should take this one as a moral victory. Durant made a huge shot at the end, but it was immediately preceded by a bitch-ass push off no call and a rip-through. I reckon we should be able to expect more from KD.

I wanted OKC to win, but... http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avr7enrZuJQ

Hawks' offense made a fool of the Thunder through the first 3 quarters, every basket seemed like an easy one, where the Thunder were struggling to get shots off and making some really tough looks. GG Hawks. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You start with the body - tall, lean, strong. Unbelievable athleticism, the league had never really seen anybody who could just hang in the air so long. Watch the old game tapes, Jordan would elevate for a shot, wait for the defenders to drop out of the air, then shoot right over the top, have a coffee and come down. His hands were gigantic too, he could palm the ball at will, giving him amazing control on the dribble, or in the air, or grabbing steals. And his speed was absolutely stunning, in the open court he had an extra gear that nobody could keep up with. 90% of the time he looked like a coiled spring, running conservatively, but then he'd explode and it was amazing to watch.

Then there was the offensive skills - his touch was absolutely ridiculous, nobody has ever come close. He'd make layups the league has still never seen again, changing his mind two or three times in the air and kissing it in with a little spin off the backboard. His post game was just unreal to watch, that turnaround fadeaway was so deadly. He was an absolutely electric scorer, if the ball was in MJ's hands something amazing could happen at any second. Excellent vision, too, finding teammates or punishing a sloppy double - and if he got a sniff of the rim, he'd rise up and posterize ANYBODY in his way.

You could talk about defense - that sprung from his ridiculous motor. The guy was just ON all the time, an absolute energy factory and there were rumours he'd party all night and turn up and still demolish you. He was a constant threat on defense, not just on his own man, but a demon in the passing lanes for steals and most games he'd have one or two out-of-nowhere flying blocks as well. 

The competitive spirit and iron will just burned in him, he was the ultimate win-at-all-costs psychopath, to the point where it almost looks like it's ruining his life after basketball. He took *everything* personally, in fact if there was the tiniest reason to get pissed off with somebody, he'd make it his mission to destroy and humiliate them, and more often than not, these were his best games. Having said that, he never took a game off. You see LeBron and the heat coasting during the regular season - that would never happen on a Bulls squad, they just had a fire inside. 72 wins in one regular season is evidence of that.

And on top of all this and his many other gifts, he was also the most stylish player ever to take the court. Everything he did just looked so damn beautiful and in control. He was loose and fluid, but incredibly strong and athletic at the same time. If you played ball in the 80s and 90s, you'd see so much of MJ's style in the other kids - tongues out, scoop reverse layups, jumpman leg splits, people just wanted to be him. It sure didn't hurt that his Nike PR team concealed what a knob he was from the public so impeccably. 

So yeah - perfect storm. Outstanding physical gifts, unparalleled drive to improve and win, smart, skilled, creative, unstoppable and more marketable than pretty much anything the world has seen since. </TEXT>
