	<TEXT> The other day I was feeling adventurous, so I decided to try a 3-way strain mixture. I went 2 grams of Red Vein Sumatran, 2 grams of Green Bali, and 2 grams of Red Vein Thai. About 45 minutes later, I was feeling pretty great, when I suddenly felt the need to shit. I went and got on the toilet and squeezed a good one out. However, I was still feeling quite adventurous, so I decided to wipe from back to front. I've always wiped from front to back, and I was just curious what it would be like to not have to lean off the seat to wipe... I could just reach down between my legs. Unfortunately, because of this, I ended up with a yeast infection on my nutsack. Do not recommend. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I used to shoot heroin. The first time I ever took kratom, I took 7 grams. I don't know which strain, I didn't know enough about kratom at the time to care. I went from being dope sick to feeling ok in about 20 minutes, it was really quite noticeable. 

I didn't catch a buzz off it at all, I just felt normal again. That was the problem. I didn't want to just be ok, I wanted to be high. I took kratom a few more times at pretty high doses, and then just went back to the opiates.

It wasn't until I went back to prison this last time and got out, that I decided to give kratom a go again. This time it worked great, because I was at baseline as far as my tolerance was concerned. It filled the void I had in me. Even though I'd been sober for about 8 months (I'd used Suboxone in prison in the beginning of my bid) , I still just felt empty. So I gave it a shot and I haven't looked back since. It's been about 8 months. 

The problem is, when he's hooked like that, the mental aspect is half the battle. And having a plant that just keeps him feeling OK is just going to cover the physical side of things, it won't do much for the mental cravings. I would say his best bet would be to (somehow) get off the opiates for about a month and then start a kratom regimen... that way it does something for him both mentally and physically. Other than that, he could start a kratom regimen now and seek outpatient treatment and/or NA/AA for the mental side of things. I don't know. I hope this helps. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Tobacco: You may crave tobacco more when using kratom. I chew tobacco and I feel nothing extra after I chew, other than I'm always ready for another chaw as soon as I spit my last one out. Food: Always take kratom on an empty stomach, being full can minimize the effects greatly. Some claim eating a small meal 45 minutes after kratom ingestion can actually potentiate it. I've never witnessed it. Soda: Some also say caffeine increases kratom efficacy. Once again, I've never noticed it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 100 mg oral morphine? Forget about it. Kratom is for people who want to maintain, not for people looking to get high. You'll never achieve that sort of feeling from kratom. Come back and give it a try when you're all strung out and out of options. Until then it's going to be pretty useless to you. Even if you take a heroic dose, the side effects will have you fucked up long before any sort of opioid feeling will. </TEXT>
