	<TEXT> Thanks! I'm drawing every spare moment I have!! haha.(Although that isn't much as I have had a summer job and I'm in an intensive IT program) I'm focusing on dot work designs lately. I find they turn out the best. I've been trying to focus on tattoo-able designs.  I actually did have an artist in mind and got a side tattoo from him but he's never taken on an apprentice...I'm thinking once I'm back to the city I'll go in and talk to someone from the same shop. 
Thanks again for the advice! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm working on a portfolio to take in and I have a shop in mind but I know nothing about how I should go about it besides that...I'm also very nervous about taking in my portfolio. I feel as though it could never be good enough as I have no actual experience tattooing and I haven't had any training besides advanced high school courses. I really need to also mention that my art isn't "photo realistic" I have a graphical/2D kind of style to my work. Any advice would be very appreciated!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's true, thank you. I was thinking fruits and vegetables, as well as oatmeal without sweet flavoring added would be good places to start. I'm hoping to keep my diet as low carb as possible. And I'm pretty small/female. So my MAX calorie intake is about 1400.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> But I honestly can't stick to it right now. I just can't sit down, figure out my macros and then plan my grocery shopping and meals off of that. I'm not good at meal prep. That's the main problem I'm having so I'm trying to find foods that are easily prepared. I'm also looking into nutrition bars. But, quest bars are out of my price range at  $40 per 12. so...I'm hoping there's a better alternative. I really appreciate any tips or advice I'm given. I'm still very new to trying to lead a healthy active lifestyle.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hmmm, its starting to sound like it's worth just waiting til my hair grows out! Do you know if the dreads were successful at 6-8 inches? Like did they end up keeping them and having them look good? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> thank you for the input! I'm still thinking I'll grow my hair out and try to get natural ones in the future. My hair is way too short for that right now though unfortunately. Parts of my hair are only 3 inches. For some reason shaving it seemed like a good idea.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I love the look of dreadlocks, I've been trying to grow my hair out to get them forever now. I haven't managed to do it but I'm thinking synthetic dreads would be a good alternative for me because I'm a Caucasian girl with thin/straight hair too. I'm wondering a few things about getting them...Such as how long should my existing hair be in order to put them in? And where should I typically go to get them put in? I've called a few places that offer extensions but no one there knows anything about putting in synthetic dreads...I know a few people that can dread actual hair would they have an easy time putting in syn ones?  </TEXT>
