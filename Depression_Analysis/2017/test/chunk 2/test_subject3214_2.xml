	<TEXT> What do people think of "Recorded on: _____ " time stamps for future Let's Plays? Personally I think it would make tracking the near-countless inside jokes we hear easier among other things.

In the beginning of the Cannon Ball Run GTA IV Let's Play, for example, Gavin says, "What if this video comes out before the other one?" To which Michael responds, "Well then people will be confused." I think time stamps like that might be a bit more helpful to us, the viewers. Just spitballin' here.  </TEXT>
