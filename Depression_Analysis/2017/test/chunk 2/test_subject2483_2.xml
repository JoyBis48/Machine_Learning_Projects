	<TEXT> Thanks so much for all the comments. I felt like I wanted to add several things. 

1) The sections are not necessarily the most important.
2) The formulaes are there for those who know them, but can be easily researched.

But most importantly:

3) This is meant to be edited and improved by this great community, so that the I.I. handbook becomes even better. If you feel something is wrong, post an edited/improved version. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey r/investing! 
I was just very curious if you could answer this question. I'm sure many others will be interested. How do you measure/understand a company's "competitive moat"? Would really wish to know.
Thanks in advance! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Where do you get your stock market news?
Just read news. In the business sections (also economy/finance/etc.) you will see companies performing good/bad. What news should you read? NYT, Economist,WSJ (for high quality), Business Insider, CNN Money (for more casual).
Do you come up with your investing ideas, or do you find inspiration or advice from some place?
Completely depends on different people. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey there investors.
During my reading of the book (2003 edit), I highlighted some of the main points I felt that were important for me. I then wrote this handbook, which is effectively a list of these quotations ordered to make a bit more sense. I then added my own notes to add/clarify the notes. 

First of all I just felt like sharing it so that it could help any of you. However, I would also love it if you could add upon it (maybe I omissed some importnat things?). Thank you in advance, and hope this helps you! :)

PS. If you didn't read the book, I strongly suggest you do.

Thanks for the upvotes! First time in my life I'm on top of a subreddit. Im very glad its on this one, I really think its the best subreddit out there! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Countries that have defeated an aggressor in war have the right to claim parts of its land, an unwritten rule in war. Germany tried, and failed, to expand its land. The surrounding nations had the right to take their land. Besides, Nazi Germany deserved the punishment it got, and present day Germany, without all this land, is far better off than at any other period. </TEXT>
