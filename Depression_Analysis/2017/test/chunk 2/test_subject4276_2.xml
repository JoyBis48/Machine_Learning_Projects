	<TEXT> It's not that it's not exporting a number of tracks, it's picking and choosing which audio sources to export instead of all of them. It exports the sound from the video intro which is on track 2, and it will export the audio attached to the video which is on track one, but the song I've added at the end of the video will not render, no matter which track it's on. playback is fine within premiere but the audio is lost during encoding.

I don't understand how I can make a bunch of videos but suddenly have the audio for the same song I've been using get left out of rendering </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Eventually I'd like to just get a remote for XBMC alone, but I also use my HTPC for browsing the web from my couch and I want to know what everyone else thinks is the best for couch browsing.

I currently have a Logitech K400 but the build quality leaves something to be desired. I've had it for over a year and the little notch on the on/off switch already wore off so it's pretty hard to turn the keyboard on and off now. The mouse buttons feel like you're barely pressing anything at all...it just feels like there is no affirmation that you actually pressed the mouse button. And on top of that, for the first year I just had the wireless dongle connected to one of the front USB ports on the PC and it worked fine from anywhere in my livingroom and even the kitchen, but now that's not good enough and I had to get a USB extension cord to bring the dongle up higher in the room so my input would stop lagging or outright not responding. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> What are Steam client features/upgrades that you would like to see? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-09-11 07:37:04 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> For me it would have to be family features and sharing. If I have two Xboxes, I can play one game downstairs, and my wife can play another in a different room, but with Steam, only one device can be logged in at a time, so that means only one of us can play any game at a time. I don't really like the idea of having to pay twice for a game unless we are going to play online with each other at the same time, but many games we buy, we don't play online, or there isn't any online.

There are two different ways I can see this happening:

1. They allow multiple devices to be connected to the same steam account on the same IP. So that means my computer upstairs can still be connected to steam while the one on our TV is also connected to Steam. Obviously, if one game is being played currently, the other computer would either be able to screenshare/observe the other player or play a different game.

2. Sharing games with different family accounts (maybe also linked to your same IP). Basically the same exact thing as above except the other computers don't have to be logged into the same account, just one that is linked with the main account. 


I think my biggest peeve with the current way Steam works is that when I open steam in my livingroom, I have to type my password again when I return to my main PC, and then when I go back downstairs again, I *again* have to type my password. It gets tiresome.

So Reddit, what are features you would like to see implemented into Steam? </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I got some discounted, pre-seasoned country style pork ribs the other day and I don't have the time to properly smoke/grill them so I'm going to use a slow cooker. 

But for the sake of saving money and producing more food in a variety, I was hoping someone could provide tips or insight to doing a bit more, like having more meat but not just adding more pork ribs.

Has anyone ever done such a thing and does it turn out well? something I was thinking was adding some different kinds of sausage links to the mix so that those will slow cook as well and I can either go onto reheating them another day to just eat on a bun or slicing them to use in another dish. I want to get the most out of the onion and peppers that will be in the crock pot </TEXT>

The wife and I are huge FMA fans so we've seen Brotherhood already, and more recently we got into Shingeki no Kyojin/Attack On Titan and Free!

If you don't mind, please write a short synopsis of what the anime is all about and why you recommend it

I didn't see a rule against recommendation threads so sorry if this is looked down on, but waiting a week for every Attack on Titan episode is killer and it leaves me wanting to watch copious amounts of anime </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> This probably isn't very revengey but it certainly is the most petty thing I've done in recent times.

At my job, a restaurant, our daily duties are outlined in a list. So in the morning we come in and go about our business and get things ready for working and then we get our lists and unless the managers decide to send someone home early, we're responsible for completing the list in its entirety, hopefully within 8 hours, and if the estimated time for the list is longer than 8 hours, certainly no longer than that allotted time. The list is generated by a computer and sometimes modified by the manager and it is determined by how much product we have on hand currently, and what we are projected to use that day/the next day.

On this particular day, I had probably a 10 hour list, and it was probably a Friday or a Saturday so product that we were low or out of had to be done quickly so we didn't run out. One of the things I had to do required sliced potatoes, and the amount I had to do required 50 pounds of it. No big deal, because as soon as I wash the potatoes, all I have to do is put it in a modular food processor that has a slicing attachment and 50 pounds of potatoes is sliced within a couple minutes. Except someone broke that attachment, and management didn't seem to care enough to tell me that it was broken. Had I known, I would have started on what I was working on sooner, but instead I did some other things that I knew needed to be done and the potatoes wouldn't be a big deal. 

You can imagine I wasn't very happy when I found out the part was broken because by this time we were almost out of what I needed it for, so now something that would take 5 minutes turned into an extra hour of work. I essentially had to stop everything else I was doing and focus on slicing the potatoes by hand. Slicing the potatoes themselves didn't take a whole hour, but that time I spent slicing potatoes between running things to the line and to the expo alley could have been spent doing other things if the part wasn't broken. I even asked the manager there at the time if there was anyone in another area that they could spare for about 15 minutes to help me slice the potatoes so I can get some other stuff done, and they said they would get some help for me, but that help never came.

And this is where the pettiness comes into play. On our list there is the printed estimated time to complete the list, and below that is a line reserved for the computer or manager to add additional time and then explain what the extra time is to be used for. Then there is a line below that to combine them for the total amount of time. I wrote an extra hour in myself and then in the comments wrote "slicing 50 pounds of potatoes by hand"

tl;dr: slicing potatoes by hand is for chumps like me </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> My family has had lots of dogs and when I moved out and got married we got a dog ourselves about 5 years ago, but none of the dogs I've ever owned were this high energy and stubborn. We recently went to the animal shelter and we just had to have this little boy. They said he's between 5 and 8 months. People tell us it looks like he's a mix breed but I'm not sure what else he's mixed with.

I know that their energy level means lots of walks/running/playing outside as well as a bigger appetite. The shelter gave us a small bag of Science Diet for his food but once that's up we're switching him to Canadae.

Also, any tips to keep him from eating our other animal's food? Including our new puppy, we have two dogs and a cat. We have our cat's food on top of a container so our smaller dog can't get to it because she made a habit of trying to starve him to death. Our new dog wants to eat both the cat food and our other dog's food. We don't free-feed our animals, they get their daily portions in the morning, but they don't eat it all at once.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> First off, forgive me for any dumb autocorrect typos as I'm on my phone, I don't have access to a computer right now. 

My wife had her appointment on Monday with her mom there with her while I was at work. At that point she had the worst panic attack yet, complete with screaming and twisting and contorting her arms. They ended up sending her to the emergency room where they gave her something stronger than clonazepam to calm her down.

At that point I got called while at work and left work to drive 2 hours to where she was. She was calm when I got there because of the meds and I had some alone time with her to talk and she told me that she NEEDS to go somewhere where it's quiet and she needs to stay there for more than just a day and she needs to be monitored while on new meds. Her family wanted her to discharge herself against medical advice in order for me to take her 4 hours to the city we grew up in so she could go to an emergency room there and get admitted to that psychiatric facility.

Her family was convinced that if she stayed and had the crisis response team evaluate her, they would force her into a facility she didn't want to go to, and more specifically, one her cousin went to that didn't work for him. They thought the staff was lying to us but since they have no control over what can be done, I made the decision to stay so we could avoid needing to wait for more blood work and waiting another 3 hours for the crisis response team in that area.

So they came and said she could stay in a facility, and got paperwork together and faxed it to the other hospital and got us set up so we could go there. I drove her the 4 hours and we were both tired and worn out but she stayed up to talk to me and kept me awake since I had about 10 hours of sleep the last few days.

My parents met us at the hospital but it would have been too many people in the room so they had to wait outside and my wife had to sit and answer more questions and by this time that medicine had worn off so her arms were wretching again and her heart rate was high but after a bit she calmed down without needing any meds because she knew she was near the end of the journey and she would get to rest somewhere peaceful and quiet so she could heal. We still had to wait because the damn laptops the nurse was using to record her answers to questions kept freezing so she would leave and we would have to wait for her to come back with another. My wife commented "all this waiting is enough to drive a crazy person sane." After they told us that they were done and soon security would come and escort her to the psych building we could have my family come in and talk for a bit and say goodbye before she had to go. The entire process was about 15 hours including the 4 hour drive between hospitals. I really hope we dont have to go through this process again. Needing to go to the emergency broom in order to get admitted to an inpatient facility is really stupid and expensive. I understand the need to have an evaluation process but can't it be sans emergency room?

She wasn't allowed any electronics so I can only call her through the hospital to talk to her but that would be awkward for her because there are no chairs near any phones and she probably can't talk long before some activity or therapy. There are two different visiting hours that I can visit her at for an hour each, which I've done every time.

She has had a lot of support, I've been there every time, her aunt and cousins have been there a couple and so have my parents. I feel bad that none of the other people in there ever get visitors. She first started some new medication the first day but I forgot what it was. She brought up to the doctor that celexa worked for her mom and they are the same blood type so they gave that a shot and will monitor her to see if that is working. She has the clonazepam which is as needed for anxiety attacks. They also have something to prevent nightmares as well as an optional sleeping pill. I'm not super comfortable with that amount of medication because each one has their own side effects and I feel like this might turn into a game of prescribing pills to treat the side effects and then prescribing pills to treat the side effects of the pills that are treating the side effects. And now I feel like I will have to get a safe for the medication to lock it up in case she gets an urge to pop them all at once.

But ever since being in there she hasn't had any dark shadow thoughts when trying to fall asleep and there aren't any nightmares as well. Over the last few days she has definitely gotten a lot more positive and it feels like this was the best decision. I'm just afraid they will kick her out too soon and then she will regress again and we will have to go through all this over again and it's getting really hard to miss work. I've already missed 3 full weeks and I already have to miss another in May because I'm going with her mom to get surgery done out of state. It was going to be my wife but she is in no condition to get on a plane, especially with that phobia.

Today was a little rough, she had a bad headache that was due to stress in her neck which I believe to be from her slouching a lot. The pain wrapped around her forehead and her depression amplified the effects of the headache and it made her extremely dizzy and weak. Walking was difficult for her and she couldn't concentrate or talk much. I bought a journal and we've been passing it back and forth between visits and writing things in it but she was unable to focus enough to write anything for me today.

She was a lot better during the second visit. A lot more talkative and she was smiling again. Still had some effects of the headache but overall better than this morning and far better than before she got in here. Before today it was looking like she might be discharged Friday but I'm not sure now. I suppose I'll wait and see how tomorrow goes.

Thanks to everyone for all the kind words in the last post. I'm sorry I wasn't able to reply to everyone. Writing everything and putting it out there is therapeutic for me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> *edit* I apologize for the huge wall of text. The first paragraph alone is a whole post in of itself when expanded. I already posted about it under a throwaway, and if you really want to read it, here is the link:
http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1atq9f/my_wife_cheated_on_me_last_week_and_then/

To make a long back story short, she started going to a doctor to get something for anxiety of flying because she was going on a trip to London. The doctor also diagnosed her with depression and prescribed her fluoxetine, so she started taking that about 2-3 weeks before her trip. She thought that our marriage was failing and that there was nothing that could be done to save it so she ended up cheating on me with someone else who went on the trip with her (it was basically one of those classes in college where you go somewhere for a couple weeks and write a couple papers on your experience and get credits). She had slowly been falling in love with him over the last year or so. When he was with her on the trip, he used her only to end his dry spell and broke her heart. When she came back, she was more broken than I've ever seen her. 2 days after she got back, she told me what had happened. My heart was broken, but she is the most important person to me in this entire world, so I vowed to her that I will right my wrongs, and I won't let this ruin our relationship. On top of all of this, she had been suffering through school for the last couple years, she didn't want to keep going and wanted to take a break but she felt that her family was pressuring her to finish as fast as she could so she has been overworking herself for the last 4 years. The trip was the final straw.

Fast forward a couple more days, I found her trying to dig into her wrists with a pair of scissors, and not just cutting across the wrists, she was trying to follow her veins "to see if she could even feel it". To this day she still doesn't remember doing that. She said when she looked at the mirror, and then saw the scissors sitting there, something else took over that wasn't her, and next thing she remembered is seeing me coming up the stairs and having scissors in her hand. Luckily the scissors were dull so she didn't even break the skin. She had a counseling appointment that day, and the counselor felt that she needed to stay at a facility for a bit. She thought it might be beneficial too so she went. I brought her things like pencils, her sketchbook, and some painting supplies because that stuff has always been therapeutic for her.

The facility discharged her a day later. The head psychiatrist had a one-on-one with her and told her that she felt she wasn't afraid for her life and that she believes what happened was only an impulse and that she wasn't truly suicidal. After I picked her up, I took about 2 weeks off of work. She told me about the place. They didn't really help her. Every time she sat down and was about to paint, they would pry her away from it to do group therapy sessions, in which she would listen to other people's problems, and then when it got to her and she explained what was going on, nobody had any type of advice for her at all and they moved onto the next person. Over the night she was kept up by someone screaming. When she finally did sleep, she was awoken early by an angry person yelling in the kitchen. It wasn't a very good experience for her.

I spent the two weeks with her and her counselor determined that she was only living her life for me, but not for herself, so all she needed to work on was loving herself again. I spent every second of every day with her, through ups and downs and I took care of her. But after that 2 weeks I had to go back to work. I was more confident in leaving her alone at that time because of the healing we had done, both individually, and as a couple. That week I had 2 days off immediately after the first day of work. My wife was at home, safe, when I got off work. She said she distracted herself all day, which is good, but also not good because I don't really feel good leaving her alone when she has to distract herself to keep herself from thinking suicidal thoughts. At this point, none of our family knows anything about what happened yet. The next day she spiraled down hard. She was talking about the suicidal thoughts and saying how she's trapped and can't get out and there's only one way, and then she had an anxiety attack, so I gave her some more of her anxiety medicine (clonazepam) and it took a really long time for her to calm down. Baths were always relaxing for her, so I got the bath ready and she sat in the hot water with me by her side. Then she put her face into the water and held it there as long as she could and expelled the air from her lungs and I had to yank her out of the water. She apologized profusely and said she didn't know what she was doing. I helped her dry herself and get dressed and we went back downstairs where she slept on the couch for at least 2 hours.

This is where I cracked. I've never had a panic/anxiety attack, and it caused me to make some bad mistakes because of a lapse of judgement. As soon as she woke up my breathing went into a frenzy. I tried calming it by taking deep breaths but it didn't work, it kept getting worse and worse and I was taking deep breaths and I was crying and I couldn't stop. I scared my wife, even though she had panic attacks herself, she hadn't dealt with anyone else having one. I've never seen her look so scared before. She didn't know what to do. She gave me one of her anxiety pills but even then it took me a long time to come down. She paced back and forth not knowing what else she could do. She sat down on the couch and cowered in the corner. When my attack was over and the medication had dulled me a bit, she took me for a drive through town like I did for her, just listening to music and not really driving in any specific direction.

After this is where I made the mistake that I regret the most. When we got home we decided to catch the bus downtown and we could go dancing and drinking. Mixing the alcohol and the medication was something that didn't even cross my mind at all....but I later found out it was on hers the whole time. We drank, and we kept drinking. We had lots of fun. I don't remember portions of that night because I did drink so much. We were able to stumble our way to a friends house where we stayed for the night. The next morning we woke up and began walking the rest of the way home and she was upset...and then she finally said it, the thought that didn't even cross my mind. She said she wanted to go peacefully last night. She hoped that drinking so much alcohol in combination with both of her medications that she would pass on during the night while she slept. Luckily, her depression medication was taken in the morning and the clonazepam was in the early afternoon, and we didn't drink until late at night, so it wasn't as if she downed her meds and immediately started drinking.

After this is where things got real scary for me. Halfway home, she completely forgot what had happened in her life. She suddenly reverted back to being 12 years old. She didn't know who I was, or where we were, and why I was holding her hand. She didn't remember where we lived but she instinctively knew which apartment was ours but didn't recognize it. We were greeted by our dog when I opened the door and she was excited to see a puppy but she didn't really know who the dog was. But she said she had a dream that her grandpa got her a dog around Christmas time and so she named her Noel (and that is actually what happened). After I talked to her for a bit she suddenly became very tired and fell asleep on the couch for at least an hour. When she woke up, she was back to herself but she didn't know how we got home and only remembers walking half of the way. She didn't remember reverting back to being 12 years old.

At this point her mom randomly showed up to run errands in town (she lives in a small town a couple hours away) and wants to have lunch with us, so we eat somewhere and then she dropped us off at the appointment we had for that day with her doctor. Her mom could tell something was up and noted that she seemed down, but she insisted nothing was wrong, and when we got out of the car, I told her that I can't hold my tongue on this situation much longer and that she can't keep avoiding her family. She told me that if I felt I needed to tell her mom then I could do that. We talked to the doctor about the previous couple days and how she spiraled back down as soon as I had to go back to work. He felt that she wasn't safe to herself and needed to go back to the facility. This is when her mom found out because she was our transportation, so when her mom showed up I went and brought her inside and the doctor explained the situation. We took her to the facility, but upon getting there, they said there were no beds left but there were other places that were in the same network in some other cities. Her mother didn't think that bringing her to another facility was a good idea so instead we agreed to let her go home with her mom, where she, her brothers, and her grandmother could keep an eye on her at all hours of the day, whereas I am unable to do so. She can't be left alone for even a minute or else the thoughts could come flooding back.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I recently got a job and it seems that my most common shift will be 4pm to midnight or 1am. I haven't done night shifts since high school and back then I didn't really have any daily responsibilities. It was just get off school, do homework, go to work, come home, watch a bit of TV, go to bed, and repeat. But now I'm an adult and I've already been conditioned to waking up an hour before I have to go to work in the morning and do all my daily things after work. 

Doing nights now means I can't really do my things after I get off work. Do you come home, shower, and go straight to bed and wake up as early as possible? I seem to have trouble with falling asleep after putting in 8-9 hours at work so I end up staying up really late browsing the net and watching TV and then I sleep until 11am-noon, and after that I only have 4 hours before I have to go to work so I don't do anything because I feel like there isn't enough time to do anything before work as I'm constantly anticipating and watching the clock to make sure I'm not late.

Anyone who has done night shifts for a while or does it for a living have any protips for me? I love this job, but without having something that's mandatory to wake up for in the morning, I'm having a hell of a time trying to manage my time wisely and I feel like it's messing with the amount of energy I have too. </TEXT>

I already took the case apart and reseated the RAM as well as taking the CPU heatsink off, cleaning up the thermal compound and re-applying it. It started up just fine so I shut it off and then put it back together and put it back in its spot and started it again, and then the same boot loop happened

***EDIT:***

So I now am able to get the computer to boot properly. I kinda found the cause, I will have to do a little more testing tomorrow when I have time. Having my external harddrive plugged into the front USB ports was causing the boot loop, even though I have my first SATA port set to be the primary boot device. So now I'm not sure if it's just the USB 3.0 jumper pin area that is bad or shorted or what. But when i plug the drive in after the computer is booted, the drive is detected and works fine.

I haven't checked to see if it will do the same thing to the rear USB3.0 ports or even the 2.0 ports. Or to see if different USB harddrives have the same effect. </TEXT>

*edit* I fixed the problem, but I'm still wondering why it did that. What I had was an entire PSD project imported into After Effects with all editable layer styles. I don't know why the gaussian blur would do that just because the layer styles were intact. What I had to do was import that layer separately as footage and merge the layer styles and then after that it blurred properly. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> I'm new to the Galaxy Nexus Club, coming from a Droid X2. On my X2 I realized the importance of a custom ROM because it was a huge performance increase on a majorly locked down phone. But can someone explain to me why I would install a custom ROM on my Galaxy Nexus? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> First off I'll mention it is a Verizon Galaxy Nexus. I know there are some LTE radio problems with the Verizon version but after using it for about a week I haven't experienced any of the problems I've read people coming across.


This phone just feels fantastic. I got it used from someone who ended up needing to get an iPhone for work because it was all Apple integrated stuff. Phone is practically brand new, with an Incipio case and the extended battery. 

But now I'm wondering, what reasons could I possibly have to switch to a custom ROM like let's say CM10? What are the benefits of using CM10 over the version of JellyBean I have on the phone? Or any other ROM for that matter?

I am going to root it just because it's a useful thing to have be done, but I just don't know what improvements a custom ROM will have. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> I just fixed my LCD monitor by replacing blown capacitors, what thing are you proud of that you fixed when it broke instead of replacing? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2012-12-04 23:53:25 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> About 2 years ago my monitor started acting up and then it finally just stopped working entirely. I read that it was common for the problem to be blown capacitors and it was an easy fix, so I opened it up and took everything apart, found some bulging capacitors and took a note of the specifications of each one. Then I went to mouser.com and ordered replacement capacitors. The replacement parts arrived but then I delayed fixing it because I didn't have a soldering iron at the time. I kept delaying it every time I had free time to get a soldering iron I'd be like meh I'll do it later. A year or so went by and I still hadn't fixed it. The stand was still sitting on my desk, the board was still on my desk, and the rest of the monitor sat on my floor. 

I then finally went and got a soldering iron from Radio Shack as well as some solder, and then again I put it off day after day, week after week, month after month. Finally yesterday while cleaning up the room I decided TODAY is the day. I got out my replacement parts, opened up my soldering iron and I went to down. All in about a half hour I had completely replaced all the bad capacitors and was ready to plug everything in and see if it worked, and it did! It worked perfectly as if it were brand new. So I put everything back together and the part that surprised me is that I remembered where each and every screw went. I was afraid I would have forgotten after 2 years of having it completely dismantled.

So here I am, with my old 2nd monitor again, satisfied with life. Here's a small album of pictures

So, Reddit, what are you proud of that you fixed instead of replaced? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> There was supposed to be a play put on by a class in the English department, but the chair of the department, Dr. Philip Gaines, took it upon himself to cancel the play less than 3 hours before it was supposed to start. He thought they were not prepared and it would reflect poorly on the department. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2012-11-29 01:24:38 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I see more than one thing wrong here:

Firstly, he's interfering with someone's class, which he shouldn't be doing.

Secondly, he's making assumptions. Somehow he was under the impression that the students were not prepared to put the play on, and yet he had no proof of this. He has no idea how much work had been put into the play. It had been in planning since about the second week of school. If he thought they weren't prepared, he shouldn't have waited until the night everything was supposed to go down to cancel it.

His personal feelings is that the play would reflect poorly on the English department, but in reality, him being a class A jerk is what will reflect poorly on not only his department, but him too. This is not how a department should be run, everyone in the play was genuinely excited for tonight, and to step on that is just wrong down to the very core. I'm involved in the play in two ways. I know people actually in the play and they are extremely upset about it being cancelled because Gaines has no idea how much work was actually put into the play. The second thing is my boss's company is one of the sponsors for the play. It was just a little thing but to have his gesture of goodwill be for nothing is a direct slap in the face by Dr. Gaines.

I'm currently drafting a letter which I will send to him, the dean of the College of Letters and Science, and President Cruzado. Even if you hadn't heard of the play, or you did and weren't planning on attending, please contact these three people and tell them how you feel about this situation. Dr. Gaines needs to know what he did was wrong and he should be made to retract his decision and allow the play to happen.

* [Dean of College of Letters and Science, Paula Lutz. Her info is in the bottom left of the page](http://www.montana.edu/lettersandscience/)

Please spread the word about this. The university we attend should ***not*** act this way. </TEXT>

A couple quick notes because for some reason some items aren't listed at some merchants:

* The Corsair PSU is 47.99 at Amazon

* The SilverStone case is $95 at Amazon

For some reason the Reddit Markup doesn't show the base price before mail in rebates which is $869.92. Adding in the instant discounts, it's $848.33. Adjusting the price for the items I'm getting off of Amazon (the PSU and case) the price is 814.77. I need to get just below $780. All items have to have free shipping, amazon prime, or shoprunner qualifications so that I don't have to spend money on shipping. Everything on Amazon is free 2 day on my list and everything on Newegg in the cart so far is shoprunner. 

Basically all I need to do is shave $40 off the build. What can I do to accomplish that? I can't change the case, it needs to be that one to work. Should I just buy most of it and wait to get some other items? I can temporarily put a stick of ram in my current PC into the new one but cutting out the RAM only brings the price down by $25. </TEXT>

Just a quick note: the first build includes the PVR, the second doesn't have it added in.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm not very familiar with mid-range products and what is better than what, especially when it comes to new mid-range stuff versus old top of the line parts.

The $800 has to include an SSD and a PVR, I was most likely going to go with the Happauge PVR2 Gaming Edition since it has HDMI inputs and I'd rather deal with HDMI than with Component. Does anyone have experience with dealing with PVRs? Can I just split the output from my AV Receiver and send one line to the TV and one to the PVR so I don't have to individually connect my PS3 and 360 to the PVR whenever I want to use it?

Ideally I'd like the computer to be small so it's semi-portable and sit horizontally. I'm thinking maybe a Micro ATX motherboard with a case that can fit at least 2 standard harddrives and an SSD. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was downloading and at first it got stuck on "starting repair" but didn't do anything. It threw the download back up into the active downloads but it wasn't going anywhere. So I paused it and other stuff started to download like normal, but this particular download is still on top of the downloaded saying "starting repair." I'm on a slower PC and needless to say par2.exe and sab were taking up quite a bit of resources because of this. So I ended up having to kill the processes. After I restarted sab it began to verify the files and got to 34/34 and then said repair failed not enough blocks. Other items are continuing to download but this still remains on the top taking up resources. I can't remove the nzb at all, it just stays there.

	<TEXT> My secondary job is that one to two nights a week I sit on a bus at night to basically make sure drunk people don't cause problems. It's mostly funded through the university here and is meant to reduce drunk driving. It earned the name "The Drunk Bus" but for some reason the student organization at the university thinks that's below them and wants that negative connotation gone, even though that is 100% the purpose of this bus. So we've taken it upon ourselves to turn it into the party bus!

When the bars close at 2am, we get a pile of drunk people on the bus, so I'm putting music onto my old Zune that would be appropriate for a bus full of drunk people to play over the speakers. What are must haves?

So far my list:

* most stuff by Journey

* most stuff by Queen

* The Final Countdown

* Wagon Wheel by Old Crow Medicine Show

* popular Lonely Island songs

* Party Rock Anthem

I sometimes type "I'm" or "I'd" or "I'll"  yet when I type "im", "Im", "id", "Id", "ill", or "Ill", the contractions are nowhere to be seen. When I just type "I" I am only given one of the contractions to choose from and sometimes none. It would be a thousand times easier for me to type if I can make custom rules because despite the pattern learning it doesn't seem to get what I want to type.

	<TITLE> Can we hunt down all bicyclists that ride on the road but obey exactly zero of the laws and burn them at the stake? </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I am so sick of bicyclists being all over the road riding at like 15mph, making illegal turns and lane changes, running stop signs and ignoring traffic lights. The wife and I almost got T-Boned in our brand new truck because a bicyclist felt that stop signs didn't apply to him. 

If there is one thing I love about winter here it's that it keeps 95% of these dumbasses off the road. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A place my wife + friends really want to rent is through them and I'm wanting to know if people have had good or neutral experiences with them. I looked for reviews online and all of them were bad but it seems like most of the problems could have been avoided by documenting the place better when they moved in. But it is also my understanding that it is far more common for people to make the effort to post negative reviews than positive ones. Pretty much all the rental companies in bozeman have exclusively negative reviews online. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> If there was an option in Minecraft to completely disable rain, would you use it? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2012-06-13 14:24:50 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I find myself always annoyed by rain. It seems to happen too often and for too long. Almost every time I come up from my mines it's raining. Every time I start a new project or building, it's raining. Whenever I die far away from spawn or my bed, it's dark and raining. So if you were given a way to end it all, would you take it? No I'm not offering something in the way of a mod, I always play online so a mod wouldn't do much good except for optifine where I can turn visually seeing the rain off. I'm just wondering if there are many people out there like me.

*edit* Yes I know there are single player commands and yes I know toomanyitems and notenoughitems have an option to turn off rain, and yes I know you can disable the particles with optifine. I'm not talking about a 3rd party solution, I'm talking first party solution, as in, vanilla minecraft has an option to disable rain like they do for clouds. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> I know a lot of people are saying that the best idea is to switch to Sprint with the news of Verizon not allowing us to keep grandfathered data plans via upgrades...but does anyone have any advice for those of us who don't have a choice? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2012-06-01 12:30:08 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> The *only* semi-viable alternative to Verizon here is ATT and that's only because they just own Alltell's old towers now. Verizon still has the best signal in the area, and besides, there's no hope for me to get unlimited by switching to ATT.

So does anyone have any advice for what I can do? The big problem for me is that my upgrade is a year out, so I can't use any upgrade pricing to get a 4g phone. And on top of that, we don't even have 4G/LTE in our area yet. Last I heard we would have it late this year or early next year but I'm afraid that if I buy a 4g phone in order to keep my unlimited, not only will I be eating the cost of buying a phone at retail pricing, but I'll also be paying an extra $10/mo for service I don't even have.

What do, Android?  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> So I spent this last week playing Batman: Arkham Asylum and Arkham City </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2012-05-24 19:09:34 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Just beat City yesterday. Seriously these the most well done superhero games I've ever played. Obviously this couldn't have been a Batman game without Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill playing as Batman and The Joker. Both games are really great at showing off how dark the Batman universe can be while still being the typical campy Batman we all know. They went to lengths to really make sure Batman doesn't kill anyone. When you do a ledge takedown you think he's just gonna toss them over the edge but he manages to tie them to the ledge and they just hang there. And when you knock people out, in Detective Mode they are shown as unconscious. And then obviously you have everything bat related, the batarang, when he sprays explosive gel he does it in the shape of a bat, his computer is called the Batcomputer.

What I was really impressed with is your encounter with multiple of the big bad guys in the Batman universe. You're trapped in Arkham Asylum or Arkham City with just about every bad guy and his henchmen who want Batman dead. It's like the equivalent of throwing a normal person into a pit of rabid wolves. And in usual Batman fashion, not a single fuck is given and he defeats everyone. Along the way your suit gets torn up to reflect how much shit he has been through in a single night.

If you like Batman even the slightest, and maybe if you don't like Batman so much, you should give this game a go if you haven't already, it's well worth the time. I did everything possible in Arkham Asylum except the challenge mode, and I'm working on doing all the side stuff in City now. </TEXT>
