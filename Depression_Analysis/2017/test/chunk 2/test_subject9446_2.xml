	<TEXT> I was homeschooled K-12.  My last two years of high school I dual-enrolled at a community college.  This enabled me to transfer in as a sophomore right out of highschool.  I got my Bachelor's in Computer Engineering in 3 years, and I my Master's in Computer Networking in 4, all with a 3.75+ GPA.

Thanks Mom and Dad for homeschooling me! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Damn, I want to know if it hit the boy or not!  There's a split second where the camera loses the soda-rocket (pop-rocket if you're from up North), and I can't tell if it hits the kid or if he manages to evade it.

Frustrating. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey Reddit,
My community holds a "Senior Breakfast" for the elderly folk in the area a couple times every year.  For the next one, I've been asked to do some form of humorous entertainment (nothing too lengthy maybe 5-10min).  Now I've done some standup before, but not with this specific demographic as my audience.  So my question is, what do you think the seniors today would find funny?

Feel free to recommend specific jokes, online resources, etc.  Your thoughts are much appreciated! </TEXT>
