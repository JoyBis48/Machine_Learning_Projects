	<TEXT> When we play the Seahawks in week 3, we will be underdogs (and rightfully so - predict 4.5 points or so).  That being said, the Broncos have the talent and tools to compete and win that game.  Seattle looked strong, but they did not look immortal by any means.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Of course you're right.  As a fanbase, the Seattle loss hit us pretty hard.  Many newer fans weren't invested during the 80's blowouts, so Superbowls were fun and games to them.  Seattle taught many of them how horrible "The Big Game" can really be.  Hence, our hatred for Seattle is very fresh in our mind, and I want to destroy them.

That being said - if, by some miracle, Super Bowl 49 features a dominant Seahawks team vs. Derek Carr and the scrappy, surprise Raiders, I will be rooting for the Seahawks to destroy you filthy Raiders *44*-8, leading them to be declared the a new Dynasty, the greatest defense ever, and listening to their fans harp on about how "only the NFC West plays real football" for the next decade.

Any Broncos fan who feels otherwise has simply lost perspective. </TEXT>

No reason that kind of thing can't happen again.  

You'd need a pretty deep league (12+ players, and at least 1 flex, maybe two) to give him a serious start those first four weeks, but in later rounds it is hard to see that much upside. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The herpesvirus family has three groups:  alpha, beta, and gamma.  They are largely classified by the site where they establish a latent infection. 

Alphaherpesviruses are HSV1, HSV2,  and Varicella Zoster Virus (VZV, which causes chickenpox upon initial infection, and shingles upon reactivation later in life).  Site of latency:  neurons.

Betaherpesviruses are things like Cytomegalovirus (CMV), and a few lesser known ones like HHV-6.  They are latent in certain progenitor blood cells.

Gammaherpesviruses are Epstein-Barr Virus, KSHV, and a few others.  They are latent in some immune blood cells.

So: tl; dr --  Related by genetics and similar life cycles, but specific sites of latency and disease states are different. </TEXT>

That being said, that a vaccination exists for Chicken Pox is encouraging. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Keep in mind that sometimes the Broncos can go 5 wide.  

Last year it was usually DT, Decker, Orange, Welker, and Caldwell.  Caldwell caught one of the opening day 7 TDs this way.

A similar 5-wide this year could include any from this group of 6:  DT, Orange, Sanders, Welker, Caldwell, Latimer.

So, he will get some snaps, even without injuries.  There's also the distinct possibility of him spelling DT after one of those long screen plays or some other deep-ball.

Of course, if a WR gets nicked up a bit, it will be much easier for him to get in there. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would like to challenge your interpretation of the ending.

The final scene is Donald Duck, awakening from a nightmare wearing USA-themed pajamas with a *Home, Sweet Home* decoration behind his bed, and a shadow on his wall, seemingly cast by a Nazi heiling (possibly even Hitler).

It is then revealed that the shadow is cast by a novelty Statue of Liberty, upon which Donald hugs and kisses it and says, "Oh boy, am I glad to be a citizen of the United States of America "

So, three things here:  

First, the immense over-the-top patriotism noted both by the pajamas and the statement could easily be interpreted as approaching caricature - suggesting that such high praise for the USA is questionable, at best.

Second, there is the rather obvious observation that the Statue of Liberty casts a shadow image which is indicative of oppression and fascism.  This can be interpreted as a suggestion that even a system supposedly based on liberty could in fact be something else.  I believe if you check some of the leading intellectuals at the time, the idea that "freedom" was just another kind of control, and "tyranny" just another form of freedom was often discussed.

Finally, I consider it important that Donald's statement was in the form of a question.  If you are going for a happy, exclamatory statement about how great the USA is, it removes nothing to have Donald actually state it.  The fact that he asks the question, "Am I glad. . . ?" is telling.

Surface level, sure, it is very, very anti-Nazi.  But isn't there something going on underneath?  I think it is ultimately a cartoon pondering the danger of becoming the evil that you purport to be fighting against, in this case, due to overuse of propaganda, stereotypes, and stolen symbols.

	<TEXT> See, I like Carroll the least of them.  Sherman is loud and obnoxious, but backs it up so you tip your cap.  Wilson is scrappy and a leader who earned his spot and the Seahawks are riding the boon of paying him pittance for now (ditto *many* others).

Carroll just some failure Jets coach who cheated his way through a college system which rewards renown and flew the coop back to the pros when the writing was on the wall.

Fuck Pete Carroll.  </TEXT>

Isn't being up 6 better than up 5 or 4?

I mean 5 and 4 are basically no different,  but six means 2 FG ties and even a touchdown forced a make from 33 yards.  Seems like Broncos should go for 2 there. </TEXT>

Way pleased. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So here's the deal:  The refs are in their first preseason game too.  It is very fresh in their minds what they need to emphasize and call.  Much of it has been horribly tricky tack and pretty bullshit.   They should tone it down when the games matter, because it just looks stupid when they watch the film and a LB gets called for illegal contact on a 1 second play when the defender MISSES his man. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> First, it is important to recognize that only certain kinds of viruses can do this.  Let's divide all human viruses into three broad categories:  DNA, RNA, and Retro- viruses.

RNA viruses only ever use RNA as their genetic material.  They will not leave DNA in our genome at all.  Flu, Cold, and the newly popular Chikungunya are a few examples. 

DNA viruses act pretty much like extra, tiny chromosomes, transcribing and replicating in a very similar fashion.  Some of these may have mechanisms for inserting their DNA into the host, but some of that research is still controversial.  Your DNA viruses are things like the herpesviruses,  HPV, Adenovirus and Poxviruses.

The Kings of integration, though, are Retroviruses (HIV being the most well known).  These viruses use RNA as their genetic material, but reverse - transcribe to DNA as an intermediate!  One part of the process involves an enzyme called integrase - it's job is to put the DNA intermediate into the host genome for subsequent activation (leaving it dormant).  Trouble is, sometimes the integration site isn't specific, and you can imagine how inserting Kilobases into a random gene could cause problems.   </TEXT>

It was also fortunate that only two receivers who accomplished this feat *before* I was born:  Watson and Taylor.

	<TEXT> Hey folk!

I am moving to Madison in about a week with my wife for a new job, and we are getting all of our Ps and Qs in order for the move (it is non-trivial; we are coming from Florida).

Some of the FAQs which interest me most are a bit outdated due to the nature of the questions, so I thought I would throw out another set of questions.

First, we are probably bailing on Bank of America.  They are fine, but it appears that the closest BoA in in Illinois - and while most of the stuff we would need is very do-able via the internet, it is probably best to be able to visit the bank in person just in case.  So, what kinds of banking / credit unions have impressed you?  We are looking at Chase, US Bank, and a couple credit unions.

Of equal importance - ISPs.  The FAQ in the sidebar is from three years ago, so I wanted a bit of an update.  What is the landscape of ISPs in Madison?  We are in western Madison, out by the Beltline Hwy, if that matters at all.  I know I can google up answers to these things, but I want any personal accounts of how things function for you folk.

Thanks a bunch!


Edit:  One day later and I've gotten a bunch of thought-out, awesome responses.  We've started researching some of the specifics, and you fine folk are definitely making the transition easier.  Many thanks! </TEXT>
