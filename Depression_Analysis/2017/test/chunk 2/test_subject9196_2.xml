	<TEXT> In my country (Poland) where mech keyboards are not popular, Razer is quite easy available. I bought it as it was for ~100$ when buying any other would be around 200$ (120$ + 40-50$ (shipping) + duty charge (20-30$) = around 200$).

So Razer was quite good choice considering situation. I own black widow tournament edition (love tkl), and now I'm considering buying Shine 3 TKL with browns. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> 2 Pizzas for 10k Dogecoins! </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Story:http://www.wykop.pl/wpis/6622222/kupie-pizze-2-za-10-000-doge-mieszkam-w-olawie-mow/

It's polish portal similar to reddit, a guy with nick "noisy" asked somebody to ordered 2 pizzas to [Oawa](https://goo.gl/maps/6JWSz) offering 10k in Dogecoins.
A guy "SharpNieSharp" took a challenge and ordered them, a special ask was to write "Dogecoin" on a box.
Pierogi (dumplings) was an extra thing - personal choice of SharpNieSharp.



Edit: If you need any translation - just ask (exam tomorrow so I will do anything apart from studying).  </TEXT>
