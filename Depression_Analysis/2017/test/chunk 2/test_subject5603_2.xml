	<TEXT> Sure they're serious, but as the article concludes:

But reform conservatism must still prove itself to be more than a slogan, more than a marketing campaign, more than that new pizza box. The Reformicons can be part of the historic correction the conservative movement badly needsor they can settle for being sophisticated enablers of more of the same.

Right now reformers have no meaningful influence in the Republican Party.

	<TEXT> The public is clearly with Republicans in opposing the law in its current form, and that's why the GOP's broad opposition is likely to continue. Republicans don't need to weaken their opposition to Obamacare**they need to find something they would like to do instead**.

I love these articles. The authors never seem to pick up that the Republicans **never find something they would like to do instead**. Or rather they always want to do the same thing instead, which is lower taxes on the wealthy.

	<TEXT> [Maybe, maybe not.](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/10/books/in-gunfight-adam-winkler-traces-the-gun-control-battle.html?pagewanted=all)
Although some gun-rights advocates talk as though gun control were a modern, 20th-century invention of an increasingly meddlesome government, the historical passages in Gunfight suggest otherwise. Not only did the nations founders balance gun rights with public safety needs, Mr. Winkler says, but the wild, wild west wasnt all that wild. According to the research of one scholar he cites, almost everyone carried firearms in the untamed wilderness, which was full of dangerous American Indians, outlaws and bears, but in the towns where people lived and businesses operated, there were often blanket ordinances against the carrying of arms by anyone. One of the towns with strict rules was the notorious Dodge City, Kan. </TEXT>

Still I think Led Zeppelin has been notably egregious in borrowing and not giving proper credit.  The worst case  was "Bring it on Home", where Robert Plant imitates Sonny Boy Williamson for the first verse and chorus and the song's ending, yet Williamson and Dixon received no credit. (Jimmy Page tried to dismiss it an homage to Sonny Boy, and claimed it was 'only a few seconds of music'.) Compare them to the Rolling Stones , who covered many old blues songs and always gave credit, used blues bands for their opening acts and even got Howling Wolf a slot to perform on Shindig!  </TEXT>
