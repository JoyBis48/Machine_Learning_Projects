	<TEXT> Perhaps I just had a shitty therapist, but all I ever got from it was "you have a chemical imbalance in your brain, sucks, don't it?" Therapy just made me focus more on the stupid things, trying to figure out why they bother me. It ended up making me feel super self-absorbed, to the point that my very best friend told me to either change or get out of her life.

I worry less about what other people currently think, but rather what they may do if I pursue a certain want. 

I suppose my biggest concern with this philosophy is that it seems like it just makes us all into selfish little twats. All I want to do is help people less fortunate than I, but I get so caught up in how I might be hurting them that I just assume that everyone is better off without me. I know it's not true, but that little voice is constantly telling me I'm a burden or a bother. I've been getting better at pushing it aside, but sometimes I just can't see the point, if it's just going to come back.

Tl;dr: maybe I just can't not give fucks, when my ultimate goal is to help others. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've been lurking on this sub for a while now. Every post is full of "your problems don't matter" or "just do it" or "be confident."

It isn't that easy. Anxiety is part of my identity. It's like telling someone with clinical depression to "just be happy." It's pointless, and a little bit offensive. I checked the sidebar, and in the "how to start not giving a fuck" post, literally all of them seem like completely insurmountable goals. How do you go from not knowing what self-confidence feels like to being super confident all the time?

I'd love to take your advice. But it's like telling rabbits to stop fucking and pooping. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I can see where they're coming from. I live in Southern Indiana, aka meth land, and knew a handful of kids who cooked in high school. It's an awful drug, and those hooked on it will do anything to get/make more.

That being said, I think this is a little extreme. You can still go buy Sudophed (sp?), just not boxes and boxes. Maybe putting a cap on the amount you can buy at a time would work better. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Dissociatives are not fun (in my opinion). Instead of passing out, expect to be having conversations with the giant spider on the wall or freaking out cuz you can't find your bread.

Edit: also, a benadryl overdose is serious business. Seizures, vomiting, coma, etc. Source: I took an od of it on purpose and am literally the only person who's been in my hospital for one, had seizures, and didn't die. Maybe I'm just paranoid, but don't fuck with this stuff. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is the best advice on this topic I've ever heard.

OP, everyone has to deal with relationships that just aren't right. And it hurts, because unless you're a sociopath, it really sucks to hurt someone else. I had a terrible, controlling, legitimately insane SO for a while. I loved him more than I could possibly say. I still do, even just for the good memories we made together. But we just weren't good together. "test_subject2886, shut up, you're about to say something you know nothing about" was a common thread. When I finally realized it wasn't working out, I agonized over the decision for weeks. I felt guilty for months afterward.

I've now been away from him for a year, and it was the best decision I've ever made. No one deserves a shitty relationship, but they help us figure out better what we need for a healthy, thriving one. So buy yourself some Ben Jerry's and remember that you've gotten through this frog, so you know you can do it again if you have to.

Tl;dr: we all have to deal with bad relationships so we can figure out what we need. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So, long story short, I make really idiotic decisions when it comes to boys.

I got played like a card by this guy for six months and all I have to show for it is a diagnosis of major depressive disorder and a short hospital stay. I decided it was a great idea to Facebook stalk him for a little bit tonight, and I ended up bawling my eyes out, just like every time I see or think about him too much.

I know that drinking my problems away will be bad in the long run, but tonight I'm killing what's left of a fifth of Captain and realizing that his new girlfriend is probably smart and funny and everything I'm not, but still holding onto the fact that she makes Sarah Jessica Parker look like she doesn't have a horsr face.

	<TEXT> I'm going to give an opinion right now that I know is incredibly unpopular in this subreddit, because it's worked for me many a time.

I enjoy faking orgasms. I am a fairly orgasmic person, though. Usually what happens is that I'll be able to tell that a guy is about to come, and I start contracting my muscles. Doing that (depending on the position) also forces my hips into a position where my clit is getting stimulation, and seeing the guy feeling me get close usually sends me over into a real orgasm.

I have completely faked them during random hookups when I just knew that it wasn't going to go anywhere, and I don't find a problem with that. If you don't care for the person, an you know he won't be inside you again, you can do whatever you want, because the next person he sleeps with will be different from you and he'll have to learn how to please her specifically. </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2013-02-19 01:34:25 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hello all!

Today I splurged a finally got myself a bottle of Seche Vite. I used it straightaway but have a few questions. I searched and a few questions were resolved, but these ones I couldn't find answers to.

I didn't run into this today, but if I need two coats of a polish to get it opaque, do I need to let the separate layers dry before putting on the next coat, or should I do them all quickly and then seche on top while they're all still tacky? I don't mean between base color and art, that question has been resolved time and time again, I mean with light colors that require more than one coat to be opaque.

Secondly, how thick is a "thick coat" of SV? I figured it meant pretty think, but I got bubbles in it today. I know it isn't from the polish underneath, because I didn't see the bubbles while I was waiting for the polish to go from really wet to slightly tacky.

Thank you all so much! This stuff really is magical. </TEXT>
