	<TEXT> if you go to chick fila and get one of their grilled chicken sandwhiches that suppose to be good. Tropical smoothie salads can be good just ask for splenda instead of sugar in smoothie and be careful on dressings. Subway is fine but i would just tear a good section of bread off or get one of their salads </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I played basketball and soccer throughout highschool and on an inter-mural level in college.  Every time I stretched before a game/practice. I ended up pulling something or having it tense on me. I also do find static stretching boring but i can deal with boring. 

I feel that for me going for a mile run or playing some basketball is more effective in getting my muscles to relax </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey everyone,

i've been using these 25 lb adjustable dumbbells i got from walmart for most my work outs to this point. However there are already some moves(like lawnmowers!) that these aren't heavy enough for. My real life cake day is coming up so I'm trying to get some money for one of the larger selectable dumbells. Which is the best? Bowflex? My main priority is that i need to be able to quickly change weights and price is nice too

	<TEXT> i wouldn't rest all together as i feel once you stop its really hard to start back up. maybe just lower intensity of everything(ie just do stretch/balance postures on yoga. on kenpo day go for a walk etc). But honestly thats just my thoughts. Only you know what is right for you. Listen to your body :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> i replace Kenpo with running the basketball court for two hours but I think that's a little different. I would not trade plyo in for anything as it is such a killer cardio workout. In the end i don't get to decide what is too much for your shoulders/arms...only you can. Standard exercise advice states yuo want to rest them after workout so they can recover....but shouldn't you be using your legs mostly in rock climbing anyways? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> yeah

my menu for a week is something like this:

Breakfast for week: nonfat Yogurt + protein bar OR oatmeal with banana..on weekends i'll cook 5 eggwhites and have two pieces wheat toast

Lunch for week: salad with turkey/ham( i keep a supply of spinach leafs, tomatoes, carrots, and turkey/ham from the deli in my work fridge) with some super low fat dressing(i use a honey mustard dressing i found at my local walmart)

DINNER for the week:

Sunday: Cook a whole bunch of chicken breast(5). Eat one with some brocolli. Store rest in fridge. Monday: Take one chicken breast(precooked) and make a chicken chili with navy beans and garbanzo beans(this should leave a bunch of leftovers that you can eat on days you don't feel like cooking. Tuesday: One Chicken breast and saute with one bell pepper(like fajitas!) Sprinkle low fat cheese on top and serve with vegi of choice. Weds: Take one chicken breast, shred and mix with 1/4 cup bbq sauce(low sugar!). sprinkle with a little cheese. Place on top of wheat english muffins and bake for 10 minutes to make mini-chicken pizza's(2-3 english muffins cut in half should be fine) Thursday:Remember that chicken chili? leftover time Friday:cut remaining chicken breast in half. shred and serve on top of salad. Saturday: Finish chicken chili at lunch. Other half chicken used in dinner of choice

combine this with a post workout proteinshake/recovery drink and you should be hitting 1900 calories per day and keeping pretty close to the 50% p, 25% c, 25%f suggested by P90x. When I get tired of chicken I'll change it up by having salmon or turkey italian sausage or a turkey burger.

If i get a hunger urge I eat about 10 almonds and drink some water and that seems to work for me </TEXT>

	<TEXT> my tip would be to secretly do classic while everyone else does lean ;) seriously though! the lean version just has more cardio and less lifting..but if you do light lifting at high reps your results should be awesome. 

My only other tip is COMMIT COMMIT COMMIT. This is a one night stand...its a full fledged workout relationship. Keep a diet, do the work and you WILL get results </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't use their recovery drink. I use my own suggested by my best friend(who happens to be a certified trainer):

1/2 cup almond milk
1 to 2 scoops protein powder(1 on cardio days, 2 on lifting days or days when you need protein boost)
1 banana
2 tbs peanut butter
1 handful of spinach
ICE

blend and drink. It tastes good and is healthy. If you don't have a blender a lot of people suggest a glass of skim milk mixed with nesquik chocolate mix as that apparently has a good proportion to proteins/carbs for good recovery </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I lost about 2 inches off my waste and 3 off my stomach. Weight stayed the same but I'm fine with that bc i'm gaining muscle. 

The 50/25/25 basically states that 50% of your calories that day should come from protein. 25% should come from carbs etc
I do this by keeping a log of what i eat at loseit.com and using their report to tab to show the amount I'm bringing in a day. Honestly, because i'm eating so clean...I feel like I'm eating a lot more and am not that hungry. I eat often in small amounts to fight off hunger.

my menu for a week is something like this:

Breakfast for week: nonfat Yogurt + protein bar OR oatmeal with banana

Lunch for week: salad with turkey/ham( i keep a supply of spinach leafs, tomatoes, carrots, and turkey/ham from the deli in my work fridge) with some super low fat dressing(i use a honey mustard dressing i found at my local walmart)

	<TEXT> here is what four weeks of classic and eating right has done for me weight wise: http://imgur.com/yk91M

this is my third attempt(and by far the farthest i've gotten) and it was MUCH easier this time. I've got a little soreness but not pain. Hopefully thats what you are doing too.

I would say if possible follow the principles of the fat burner diet (50% protein, 25% carbs, 25% fat) as that is probably the most important part </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Today is my Kenpo day for week 3 and I shall be doing it as soon as i get home. I've got to say that I'm a little discourage by lack of visible results. But hey...as Tony says "Rome was built in a day and neither was your body". I've spent the last 2 years gaining 25 lbs and a significant portion of body fat...can't expect it to fall off in 3 weeks. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've started the program multiple times before and quit by the end of the first week every single time. However, this time I sort of just went "f*** it" and decided I AM doing this every single day for 90 days. So far I'm on day away for finishing week 3.

The thing for me is I mentally made the realization that this isn't a work out class. This isn't fitness 101. I'm doing this for me and no one else. I want my body to be back in the shape it was when i played basketball and soccer in highschool. I want that energy. I guess what i'm saying is that I know in the end all the work i put into it is going to pay off into the body i want. 

EDIT: I also told a lot of people who i keep in regular contact with so that i know i can't slack off </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well it depends on what section you are on of the diet. I believe the amount of calories they have you using on each phase goes up. So if you are still on Fat Burner(which you probably shouldn't be on for long) then you will go up soon. Also, remember that p90x is more for lean muscle creation than bulking up.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> try to keep the diet better. Diet is actually more important than the exercise(ie you can lose weight on diet alone). What I do is find foods i like that are quick to make. My dinners tend to be: 

* Sunday: Cook a whole bunch of chicken breast(5). Eat one with some brocolli. Store rest in fridge.
* Monday: Take one chicken breast(precooked) and make a chicken chili with navy beans and garbanzo beans(this should leave a bunch of leftovers that you can eat on days you don't feel like cooking.
* Tuesday: One Chicken breast and saute with one bell pepper(like fajitas!) Sprinkle low fat cheese on top and serve with vegi of choice.
* Weds: Take one chicken breast, shred and mix with 1/4 cup bbq sauce(low sugar!). sprinkle with a little cheese. Place on top of wheat english muffins and bake for 10 minutes to make mini-chicken pizza's(2 english muffins cut in half should be fine)
* Thursday:Remember that chicken chili? leftover time
* Friday:cut remaining chicken breast in half. shred and serve on top of salad.
* Saturday: Finish chicken chili at lunch. Other half chicken used in dinner of choice

	<TEXT> Yesterday i did leg/back and i was pretty sore this morning. During work i ended up having to climb 4 [strads](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ef/Containerlift_straddle_carrier.jpg/220px-Containerlift_straddle_carrier.jpg) which are about 50-75 feet tall.

When i got home today i pushed play on Kenpo, broke a small sweat and then got to the kicks and stopped(boo on me!). How would you suggest i make it up? Try kenpo again tomorrow? Go running? Or do you think the climbing helps make up for that 30 minutes? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> no way. Looking through the ingredient list you should be able to see that its no bueno. It contains acai berry which everyone thought was this super fat burner but eventually research found it burned lean muscle! you definitely dont want that. Just go with a regular protein drink. Much cheaper! My protein drink is to blend a 1 scoop(or 2 on chest days) of protein powder, 1 banana, 1 handful spinach, 2 tbs peanut butter, 1/3 cup almond milk, and a handful ice. It tastes delicious! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Finished Legs and Back about an hour and half ago. I have worked out every day! Yay me! I also did decently at yoga yesterday...i felt like i did enough work to use a recovery drink. I'm not as sore as i expect to be. Not sure if this mean's i should go harder. I got another Gold's Gym spacesaver 25lb single so that i can try some heavier weights on the upper body workouts. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Kenpo can actually be one of the hardest exercises if you are willing to "bring it" . To make this exercise killer act like you are actually a mma fighter(i call this the Clay Guida). Stay on your toes and do small bounces during all moves. This will keep your leg muscles constantly twitching and will tire you quickly! super fun </TEXT>

	<TEXT> thanks for the lunch idea! i actually did that today and put it over a bed of spinach leafs. 

any other breakfast ideas? I find cottage cheese and hard boil eggs gag nasty. It also has to be something i can eat at my office desk. Today i switched out the oatmeal for a non fat vanilla yogurt and that helped a lot on carbs but not so much on protein </TEXT>

	<TEXT> as a guy who played basketball all throughout highschool this posts pains me. I'm sure that practically basketballs may work. I would worry about it though because that much pressure on any basketball is sure to warp and misform it...and at that point you may be doing more harm than good. </TEXT>
