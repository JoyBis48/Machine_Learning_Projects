You know how it went on sale 2 days ago? Well this whole damn time I've owned the game I have just assumed I've had it. Until last night.

I play mulitplayer with some friends of mine and I try and join their game only to find out I don't actually have it and now it's $30 (a little ridiculous for a DLC if you ask me). If you have an extra copy from a bundle, i'd appreciate it.

I'll even draw something in mspaint for you if you comment (you don't have to give me the game for me to draw.) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> One of you fine people posted a couple weeks ago about this site called usertesting.com.

I sign up and took a practice test (which paid out $10), got a 5 star rating and haven't really received a test since. I mean, you get screened for most of them (which, so far, has led me to 0 successes). 

Do you have any tips or tricks on getting new tests? I mean shit, I'd love the extra work but it is so damn picky. Should I just lie or something? I'd hate to do that. </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2014-07-21 18:47:34 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hello all, I hope I'm in the right place.  

My yard has a bad chigger problem. If any of us or our animals go out, we get eaten alive. I've been researching non-pesticidal ways to remove them from our yard and have come up with two safe tactics.

1. Nematodes
2. Sulfur  

My problem is, I'd like to rid them while spending the least amount of cash.  

Nematodes work well, I hear, but they are pretty expensive and require a special hose hookup to apply.  

Sulfur is cheap but I'm curious if it will affect my yard's ecosystem in a harmful way. I know it smells (that's not an issue for me) but would that smell keep birds away? What about bees? I'd hate to shoo bees away because of the chiggers. Would it negatively affect my dog?  

Any help would be appreciated. </TEXT>

Anyhow, I sit down to take the browns to the superb owl. I pinch a couple of loaves and realize that there is no toilet paper in my stall. Shit! 

I didn't want to walk out with my ass covered in dookie so I asked the man in the stall next to me if he could spare some squares. He shuffles real quick and hands me a wadded up tp bunch with warm liquid on it.

I smelt it (you would too) and it was totes jizz.


TL;DR. Wiped my ass with a jizz soaked TP square. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> At work we have [wall-mounted lock box](http://imgur.com/UEUElTj) where we store keys. It's always been open but yesterday I bumped up against it and closed it. Now it's locked shut and nobody knows the combination.

It's not your typical [multiple-dial lock](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/99/Combination_discs.png), I've looked up youtube guides that tell people to look for markings under the turning dials and it doesn't have that. What I do see is [THIS](http://imgur.com/m3MtVjw). There is a flat surface on the cylinder below all three of the dials. I've tried lining them up facing me with no luck, I tried using the opposite number as well with no luck. I'm not even sure if that's the way I should be going in order to open it.

I need help opening this lock. Any help would be appreciated. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> "BECAUSE IT'S COMMON C-C-COURTESY. 

Think about it, Morty. You're have school on Friday *buurp* so you can't go see the midnight premier of C-Captain America: The Whatever. So you're talking to your friends when one goes:

'Hey Morty!, I saw Captain America: The Winter Soilder last night, here is some pictures of it even though you haven't seen it yet because you're following your capitalist overlords' wishes by being a slave to education and you're a good boy because of social pressures.'

H-h-how would you feel, MORTY? Would you feel angry!? *Beeeeeelllcccchhh* Yeah, that's what I thought. Think about, it Morty."



I get it, it's a karma gravy-train. But some of us have to be up for work early in the morning, have early classes, or don't have cable and have to wait for the episodes to be available online. So here we are browsing and BAM, a spoiler appears. It doesn't feel to good. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Help with road bike purchase! </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hello Gracious Community!

I've recently decided to acquire a road bike and I've got some helpful tips from users on where to find a great selection of used ones under $200 (120.53 pounds, 145.36 euro). Below is a list of links of bikes that I thought looked great. Do you mind giving your two cents on which one would be the best purchase or advice on what a good deal looks like?

Here are some specs as to my body type:

I'm 5ft 8in (172.72cm)  
I weigh 195lbs (88.4505kg)


Also, if you see one that's not worth the price listed, feel free to give me an amount and I'll ask the seller! 

I very much appreciate your assistance. Thank you for the support/help! </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Handle Bar Troubles </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-04-02 19:53:17 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hello community!

I have a low-end mountain bike. I bought it used for $25. The only big issue I have with it is the handlebar keeps coming loose! I've tried tightening the bolt and ended up stripping it. I have a new bolt and it's not working to well either. Do you have any recommendations on how to keep it secure? Maybe a trick? 

Also, where is the best place to find used sports bikes? Like the majority of the ones on the front page. I really like their design, the thinner wheels, and the two-placement handlebars. They also look like they're a little lighter than mine. But they're expensive new! 

Thank you so much for your help! </TEXT>

The game doesn't freeze as the quirky comments above the loading bar keep changing. I've tried Texture Compressor (even the aggressive version) with no luck.

I would love your advice.

I have learned about drying racks and shoe trees but was wondering if the community here could give me other types of tips and tricks that could extend the life of my business clothes including (but not limited to): button-down shirts, dress pants, dress shoes, undershirts, etc.

Upvote the post for awareness and winners will be chosen tomorrow at 8pm Central Standard Time.

Do not forget to provide your Steam ID. Please refrain from requesting if you have already received something from GoG. I know how disappointing it is to submit to countless offers and come up with  nothing, so I'd like to give only the underdogs a chance. 


EDIT FOR ALL:

User /u/lumenation has informed me of this info:

**If you have Sims 3 on steam and try to buy expansions from stores or from Origin, they will not pair with the Sims 3 on steam. Only expac's bought on steam will work with Sims 3.  

However you can use the steam Sims 3 key on origin and any expec's bought on steam with origin as well.
If you knew this or not I just thought I'd let you know so you can inform others. I had issues with this when I originally had Sims 3 on my steam.**

EDIT 2: Thank you for your entries, ladies and gentlemen. /u/Manlyarmpits is the winner! Congratulations! </TEXT>
