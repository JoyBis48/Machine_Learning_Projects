	<TEXT> I don't see why approaching mental states as legitimate subjects of inquiry should entail that they are irreducible. 

I would distinguish between mental and inner states. A "mental state" could just be a stage of a process, like a machine state. An "inner state" to me presupposes some sort of qualitative barrier between process and perception.

My whole point in this discussion is basically I don't know how qualia could ever be considered "states" in the "machine state" or "process state" mould, therefore we can't talk about qualia without presupposing a different kind of "state" that is not a stage of a process.

In other words, I am arguing that reductionism rules out qualia and consciousness as legitimate concepts. That doesn't mean I consider reductionism *wrong* (I am up in the air about that), merely that I think those are the inevitable consequences of accepting it.

we already know a lot more than we did 20 years ago about how the brain handles vision, conscious awareness, religious experiences...

I'd agree with the first and last of those, but not the middle one. Explaining the neural correlates of consciousness is not explaining consciousness, unless doing so can "explain away" consciousness as a meaningful idea, a la Dennet's attempt.

I think that consciousness, as well as qualia, must either be null or radically other. I don't see the middle ground like you seem to.

The idea that maybe they [animals] are just automata that happen to behave in a certain way while experiencing nothing is a remote skeptical possibility akin to "what if we're really brains in a vat?" or "what if other humans are really unconscious zombies?"

It's not remote since many believe that we humans are such automata as well. We can at least say that humans have the *concept* of qualia, even if it turns out not to refer to anything. We can't communicate this concept to animals so we have no way of telling what qualitative experience they may or may not have.

On the ethical side, though, I agree with you: In the absence of strong evidence otherwise it is ethical to assume that humans and animals both experience qualia.

Since our qualia seem to be in continual flux, that suggests to me that it must be a process (or more likely, a set of processes).

I think you're confusing change in stimuli with mental processes. They're two different things. I'm saying - how does qualia fluctuate *if the stimuli remains the same*? A point stimuli or a constant stimuli can kick off a whole cascade of processes but it only seems to generate one immediate, constant quale. Red only becomes "less red" when the rods in my eyes saturate (a physical process). The fact that the quale goes away when I look at something else is not the issue.

then some subset of those feedback connections would be projecting into the visual cortex and incorporating that information into the stream of consciousness. 

The problem is, it doesn't appear as a "stream" or a "process," but as a pointlike experience. Obviously a process assembles that experience before it is "presented" to the awareness, but what is it that can apprehend the entire process instantaneously?

Again, it's not enough to say "well, it really doesn't happen instantaneously, we've proven in the lab that there's a lag of 40 milliseconds" or whatever. Why does it *appear* instantaneous? Where does this sense come from? 

Why a major problem [with Blindsight]? To me it just suggests that it's possible to have a visual experience (however degraded) that one is not consciously aware of. 

Because it argues against the *role* consciousness has been assigned in current reductionist theories, which is as *the name we give to the processing of stimuli via mental states.* Here is a complex mental state in response to a stimuli, with *no conscious component*. That's a huge problem in my book.

Reductionists could fall back on the older view of consciousness as a pure epiphenomenon, an "impotent narrator," but that view has been out of fashion for some time and for good reason.

maybe there is crosstalk in the circuits which, while relatively data-poor, allows patients to perform slightly above chance (which is all they find in performance tests).

[This article](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/7794783.stm) seems to suggest something a good deal more shocking than "performing slightly above chance." Key quote:

"A video recording shows him completing the obstacle course set up by the scientists "flawlessly", without the aid of his cane or another person."

Also he can respond to facial expressions which is one of the most complex tasks of the brain and I doubt it can be explained by weak cross-talk.

You might be interested in the work of Colin McGinn on this subject.

I can only wonder if these pessimists have ever actually opened a neuroscience textbook, because the way they talk, you'd expect neuroscience books to be 2 pages long!

A lot of them are Philosophers of the Mind, so I *hope* they have read neuroscience, though you never know. Anyway the pessimists aren't so much saying "we can never figure out the brain" in the heuristic sense of figuring out what region processes what, as they are saying that the "deep truths" we want to find by studying the brain, such as "is reductionism true?" simply aren't accessible, and perhaps aren't even intelligible concepts.

Note this is different from saying "consciousness isn't an intelligible concept," it is a level of abstraction removed. The pessimists are saying "asking whether or not consciousness is an intelligible concept is not an answerable question."

Going back to McGinn again he is also sympathetic to this idea though I think at heart he's a non-reductionist though he doesn't declare openly for that.

I'm not one of these pessimists myself but the way that very smart people (a lot more educated than I am) continually seem to talk past and misunderstand each other on this subject makes me queasy that they may be right. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The tendency to over-define vague terms and then follow those definitions to their logical conclusions gets philosophers into muddles.

True, and that might be the problem with qualia. 

I fear we're constructing a pantheon of very slippery inner states, and then postulating new mental states to cover up for the holes in our initial description. In this practice, we quickly reach a point where our main limiting factor is our imagination.

That's my fear also.

My worry is not that there aren't any such inner states to describe, but that our description is theory-rich and data-poor, and therefore we may be misdescribing them rather badly.

I hope so, and I hope more data might shed some light on these questions. However, as of now I can't see a way out of the trap. Accepting "inner states" to any degree seems to entail accepting the whole ridiculous pantheon of irreducible and incommensurable qualia. Rejecting "inner states" means discounting phenomenological observation altogether, which seems almost as ridiculous.

Can't we be pretty sure that animals experience pain? They behave like they're in pain, they have neural wiring similar to that which processes pain in humans, similar stimuli seem to cause pain in animals. 

I'm not as confident. We don't know where in the brain qualia are produced, if they even exist (and if they are even produced by the brain, if they exist.) They may be produced only in the prefrontal cortex, which animals don't possess to the same degree. Animals may simply process the stimuli of pain without any accompanying qualia. It's impossible to know, but I also think it's immoral to assume that they don't and that it's ok to hurt animals.

(btw, the fact that almost all moral systems are implicitly based on the existence of qualia is what makes a lot of people so leery about qualophobes, regardless of the evidence.)

This isn't obvious to me. Actually since qualia fluctuate over time, it seems to me that they are almost certainly processes.

How do qualia fluctuate in your view? Do you mean only if the stimuli changes? We would agree there. But not if the stimuli remains the same. They seem to be point-like experiences to me. Sure, a color will fade if you look at it too long because the rods in your eyes get saturated, but that's a different issue.

A desktop computer is a serial processor and will process these in sequence... whereas our brain's architecture is massively parallel, allowing it to perform many computations simultaneously. 

Actually, modern computers are massively parallel as well. I'm not denying that the brain processes imagery in parallel. Obviously it does. What bothers me is that these parallel processes then seem to produce outputs that are presented to our awareness as a unity.

Blindsight shows that visual stimuli response can function independently of any visual experience. This is a major problem for reductionists.

I have a feeling you're going to tell me this doesn't help, but I'm not sure why.

I'm concerned with how we experience a process as a unity, a point-like experience. That's where I see a weakness in the reductionist argument. 

If the non-reductionists can somehow tame the zoo of qualia, I might "go over" to their side. I'm not there yet though. I'm more thinking a third approach might be needed, but I have no idea what that could be. 

I'm also more sympathetic now than I used to be to the epistemological pessimists who think the mind can no more think about itself than a hammer can hammer itself, that our minds are designed to be "turned outwards towards the world" and that too much introspection on mental states inevitably leads to logical knots, simply because we're not designed to process that sort of information.

	<TEXT> I'm not too familiar with this position. Is this Dennett's view?

More or less. Though he's too canny to ever say so in such simple terms, in my reading he thinks both qualia and consciousness are "null pointers" - words that don't really refer to anything meaningful. For a while I thought he had the true picture - right down the the competing networks of Darwinian neurons fighting for dopamine - but now I'm not so sure.

higher vs. lower functions...

I would take a Heideggerian approach to this question. Anything "ready to hand" that we can use in a transparent fashion without  rational thinking is a lower function, even if it was set by practicing it as a higher function (for example that choke hold, which had to be puzzled out and learned before it became automatic) Anything "unready to hand" that requires us to activate our reasoning skills is a higher function. 

I'm not sure if I agree with the entailment from propositional attitudes to qualia or not. If I say "I believe that 2+2=4" how would we characterize the corresponding quale?

*Believing* it, as opposed to merely using the fact in a process, would entail the quale of the emotion of belief, the feeling we get when we look at something we know to be true. 2 + 2 = 5 is not just a false statement, it triggers a different quale when we see it (in the qualophile's view.)

we want to know why all this processing is accompanied by "inner feels." Maybe 'qualia' is not the best concept with which to get a handle on the problem, but turning a blind eye to it doesn't seem like a solution.

Exactly.  I agree. However, the reason *why* I agree has to do with the simultaneity of visual perception, which I will try to explain below.

I think a strong case can be made for the existence of qualia in non-linguistic animals (think animal pain, blue dot on the forehead test, food preferences, etc.)

I'm not sure. If you believe in qualia, you believe there's a difference between "seeing blue" the way a computer can (or seeing a face the way Cottrel's network can), and really *seeing blue* (seeing the quale not processing the wavelength.) Since we can't communicate like this with animals, we can't know for certain either way.

Damn. Sorry man, I'm just not understanding why this is a problem.

Ok, I'll be glad to try again. Thanks for sticking with this discussion! 

Reductionist theories of mind run into a problem when they encounter mental phenomena that *don't seem to be processes*. Thought is a process. Emotion, Demasio and others have argued with merit, is a process. Qualia are obviously not processes but the very concept of qualia is shaky. 

But what about visual perception? Phenomenologically, it doesn't seem (and seeming is what's important here, since we're talking about inner states) that I see first the cat, then the lamp, and process these two concepts like a computer program would that could recognize multiple objects in a picture (these do exist.)

Rather, I seem to apprehend both of them *at the same time*. Visual perception appears not to be a process but rather a *pointlike experience* that is nevertheless very rich in data.

It is the nature of visual perception, at once pointlike in time and vast in the amount of stimuli that is perceived, that seems very un-process-like.

If we accept that it is not a process, we should also be more open to the idea that other non-processed mental states like qualia also might exist (where there's one monkey, there's more...). 

I'm starting to suspect that qualia might indeed exist, and only be *mediated* by language, which can open or foreclose access to them depending on the grammar, and not created as an illusion of language, and the reason there's no sharp cutoff between "redness" and "orangeness" is because there's just one color qualia that exists as a continuum.

But this opens a huge can of worms. Qualia must either be null or *radically* Other, beyond all category of thought or understanding. Even a thoroughgoing dualism in the traditional sense seems to leave no room for qualia. You would need an unbounded pluralism of incommensurable experiences, each its own separate ineffable Universe and yet somehow united within our minds. That sounds like the sort of conceptual disaster that usually results from having started from wrong premises.

So I'm still torn on the qualia issue.

Is there a wiki page on this?

I couldn't find anything more specific than stuff on qualia and the Hard Problem. There are some technical articles that talk about the problems of simultaneity and I remember reading about this issue in Penrose and Chalmers (who proposed quantum and dualistic solutions, respectively.) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> making the most serious attempts to give a legitimate explanation of qualia (as opposed to the defeatists who seem to suggest that qualia are magical and inexplicable).

Or those who think they're just a trick of language?

"Language of thought" folks believe that this is essentially language-like whereas eliminativists of the Churchland variety think that the brain's basic cognitive processes are rather non-language-like

I think both views are simplistic. Our "higher" cognitive functions are obviously language-like in processing, at least in my view, whereas "instinct"-type reactions are not. Habits fall in between the two - that's why they can be so hard to break.

As far as I can tell the questions are entirely independent. 

Why I think the two issues are fundamentally the same is that, as far as I understand the concept, a propositional attitude must have an intentional object. It is hard to see how such an object can be anything other than a quale. 

If there truly are propositional attitudes such as "I would like to have a beer," rather than simple processes that report such sentences as part of their functioning, then the quale for the taste of beer is implied.

I know the eliminationists don't believe in these attitudes, and I thought they didn't believe in quales either, but you say they are merely "reductionist" in relation to quales. I don't quite see the difference because according to the classic definition at least, quales are irreducible. A reduced quale is a non-existent one.

Skeptical in what sense? Skeptical that the term 'qualia' refers to anything at all? 

Yes. For a while I was in the "it's all just a trick of language" school and I still think those arguments have a lot of merit. For example, if there is a quale that embodies "redness," when we see a color shift for example in a computer graphics display, we should notice a sharp cutoff where "redness" changes to "orangeness," but we don't. 

Also, people who speak languages that don't distinguish between "blue" and "green," Japanese for example, have been shown to be able to see less shades in that color range than English-speakers. All this points to quales somehow arising from language and not being fundamental.

Where I've started to doubt that view, however, is in the appearance of the simultaneity of visual perception. Looking at the room right now, I see a lamp, and a cat, *apparently at the same time*, and as distinct objects, not a blob combining the qualities of both (a furry, purring lamp for example.) 

How is this possible? If the mind is a mere process, how does this perception arise? There should only be reaction to visual stimuli, as with the Blindsight phenomenon, but nothing else. Yet something else appears that, unlike color quales, it is quite difficult to explain as a trick of language.

Before you chalk me up as a disciple of the Time Cube guy, the two dimensions of time and String Theory stuff was partly tongue-in-cheek, but this problem seems so vexing I wonder if this or a similarly bizarre explanation will eventually be needed.

What I was referring to is that in String Theory there are "extra" dimensions that are not linear, but rather curled around the three dimensions we know and love. Much like a tightrope walker will perceive a tightrope as one dimension, but an ant will see two (the ant can go forward and backward as well as around the "curled up" dimension that composes the rope itself.), in String Theory at a small scale our Universe has 10 or 11 spatial dimensions, not 3.

What I was proposing was that perhaps time also has a String Theory-like "curled up" dimension and that's how visual perception can be a process yet still somehow seem presented as a unity to the mind.

And of course Roger Penrose is a physicist who became interested in the philosophy of the mind and concluded that quantum physics must somehow be involved, launching an entire industry of bad New Age books misinterpreting his ideas. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks for the detailed reply. You're lucky you got to work with some of the most eminent modern philosophers - whether I agree with them or not, that's quite an experience and one I wish I could have had.

So obviously your experience with them is very extensive and I'll take your word for it on what their true views are. However, I am puzzled by a couple of things you said:

believe that neuroscience science will explain qualia.

That is the qualophobic position, if I am correct. "phobic" is just an unfortunate appelation that this position got stuck with. It doesn't literally mean they are *afraid* to address the issue qualia, just that they think qualia can be reduced to neurology without either a dualistic or an emergent order.

they all agree that there is something wrong with folk psychology but they can disagree radically as to what (for the Churchlands, it's propositional attitudes, for others it's qualia or consciousness).

I don't think there's really much of a difference between propositional attitudes and qualia, fundamentally. They both seem to refer to mental states that can't be reduced to mere *processes*, and that's the real issue in my book.

I'm pretty skeptical about qualia myself, both internal and external, but the one phenomenon I don't think has been explained is the simultaneity of distinct objects of visual perception, and that one thread kind of lets everything else in again through the back door. 

It's not enough to say that vision merely *appears* simultaneous, obviously it's not and many studies have proven this (including the infamous "gorilla" experiment), because it's appearances that are the issue. Why should it appear simultaneous? How does this unity, however illusory it might be, manifest? I don't know of any reductionist philosopher who's explained that to my satisfaction.

I have an admittedly crazy theory that there are two dimensions of time, the other one curled up around our familiar dimension like the extra dimensions of String Theory, and that the unity of visual perception is processed in that dimension, using some Penrose-style quantum woo-woo hand-waving, and then somehow "presented" back to the ordinary mind as a unity.

So if you don't think I'm entirely bonkers after hearing that, I'd love to hear any further thoughts you might have on the subject, given that even formidable minds have said what we should do with this issue is just "sweep it aside and hope for the best"

	<TEXT> Before you suggest "Ghost in the Shell," this was NOT Ghost in the Shell, I've seen every movie and episode, and this wasn't it.

What I remember for sure: It was quite similar to Ghost in the Shell. It involved cops in Japan with tank-like robot assistants. The plot was convoluted, but in the end it was revealed the evil mastermind was an old man who lived in a giant dome who was trying to merge trees and robots to create a new form of life. In the end his plot was foiled, but all the tank-robots were destroyed in the process.

Stuff I *think* I remember: It was on Adult Swim, in the early 2000's, but my friend thinks it was on MTV instead.  </TEXT>
