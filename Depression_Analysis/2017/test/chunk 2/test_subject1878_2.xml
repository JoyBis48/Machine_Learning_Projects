What kind of facts you're presenting to a denier determines what stage of denial their response will be, and they'll collapse from one stage to another like quantum energy stuff... </TEXT>

What's more effective at causing fear, an improvised explosive on a bus full of people, or a minor tremor?

Then no, it's not a different discussion. Fracking is used because it's the cost is just slightly lower than the price they can sell it for. If they can't pump the water underground without treatment, they can't frack. They can't frack, no earthquakes... </TEXT>
