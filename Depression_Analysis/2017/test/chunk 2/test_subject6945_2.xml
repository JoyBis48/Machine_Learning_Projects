	<TEXT> I'm probably going to get the shit ripped through me for this, but I'm new here so cut me some slack. 

why is asking what to get a bad thing? 
I only ask because I was just about to make a post asking for some advice on some good gear and places to get it from for someone who isn't familiar with all this.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> as the title explains I'm struggling to find a suitable FIFO job in the mining sector. 

I am a qualified fitter and machinest with a wide variety of experience, but I'm having trouble finding work in the mines. 

mainly due to the fact I'm unsure of where to start looking, Iv tried all the main job search sites but can't seem to find anything suitable or within my qualifications, most jobs Iv found have been for high up supervisor jobs and such, and seeing as Iv only been qualified for 7 months I doubt I will have any luck with a job like that. 

all I have been hearing about is this "mining boom" where so many people are getting these amazingly high paid jobs, but I can't find them! 

so if any of you have any advice on how I can get my foot in the door I would really appreciate it! :)
