	<TEXT> What if LoL had characters from anime like Naruto, Sasuke, Kakashi, etc. Kakashi's ult would be his sharingan and he could send the opponent champion anywhere on the map. Or from Fairy Tail Natsu's fire dragon roar would be his Q. Would take a million years in programming but worth it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Anything can ruin lives, not just drugs. It's up to the consumer to say no, it's not up to the man trying to make a living. For all you know, meth could have enhanced the lives of a minority who would otherwise have nothing else. </TEXT>
