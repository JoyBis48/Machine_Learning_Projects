	<TEXT> We all know that Golden Freddy Appears in the fnaf3 stage01 minigame since you play as him. The file dump for fnaf3 was recently released with the sound files and textures. While looking through the textures i found this guy (its #290 if you want to look for yourself) So, where do you guys think he is. Its transparent so he probably belongs somewhere unless scott removed him. Anyone seen him yet? </TEXT>
