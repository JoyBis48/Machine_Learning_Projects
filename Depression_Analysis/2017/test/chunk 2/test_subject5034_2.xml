	<TEXT> Not sure why you were down voted.  I have many friends that are exactly what you described, people that never leave.  I decided, fuck that, saved up my money and moved out of the country.  Its just all about making the decision to actually do it.

Edit: spelling </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Personally I'd be thinking about the first few weeks after our wedding when we'd start talking about fetishes and sexual boundaries/secret desires and all that and I'd tell her how much I want to give her an enema. To be clear I'd want her to privately give herself an enema first so there's no scat then fill herself up with water again along with 3 movie sized bags of skittles and invite me in the bathroom, I just want her to squat over me in the bathtub so I can stare and poke at her anus as she sprays a jet of skittlewater into my mouth as I wildly jack off as the crack of wet skittles spraying off my teeth creates a machine gun sound effect, then finger her as I lick out her gaping anus as it twitches and quivers. She's a bit weirded out at this but she loves me and knows this fetish is something I've been fantasizing about since I was 12. Plus we're married and have a newborn together, what is she going to do, divorce me over this? She's more than welcome to peg me afterwards or any other fucked up fetish most guys would balk at.

That is my personal favorite.  I still can't stop laughing </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My friends and I also saw Jawsome very often, but we have now incorporated more words into this style.  Words like "Jawful" or "Jawstruck"

"Man, I am jawstruck by how jawful this movie is." </TEXT>

This is a list of recall offices, and many union halls in cities/towns also have outposts where you can sign them.  That's where my parent's and siblings signed.  As I am living out of country, I can't sign. :(   But promote this list of locations if more people you know are unaware and wish to sign. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Obviously everyone has different tastes in music.  Different strokes for different folks.  So I guess I will start, bands I listen to that really just rock my socks and maybe more people should have their socks rocked by: The Decemberists and Limbeck.

Both awesome, in my opinion.  What about you guys? </TEXT>
