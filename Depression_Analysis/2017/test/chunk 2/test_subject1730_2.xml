	<TEXT> I love how people forget that they USCG is the 5^th branch of the US Armed Services. If I recall correctly too, the High Endurance Cutters (Hamilton Class) were picked up by the USCG after being rejected by the US Navy as a ship design. Additionally, putting a CIWS right over the screw is a horrible fucking design. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I guess the question to ask yourself is "What are you looking to get out of all of this?" Her interests are rather small but her groups show that she's a member of a couple of AB/DL groups. So she's got some interests in the fetish even if nothing's listed in her profile. Another thing to bear in mind is that not everyone has a webcam. I know almost every laptop now has one built in, but if she has a desktop, there's no guarantee of a webcam. You could always ask if she's got an amazon wishlist and ask her to put a webcam on there that you could purchase for her too.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hmmm... You might be able to find something that's fragrant free or you can try a corn starch based powder. However, you can help cut down on the smell by applying a bit less and rubbing it in. I've found that even though we can be paranoid because WE know we're diapered, most everyone else either doesn't know or if they smell it, won't care. I went to school with a gentleman who would dust his crotch with baby powder every day to help cut down on chafing. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> One thing I would recommend is to give your body like 30 minutes or so to air out each day. Letting your diaper area breathe a bit each day will help cut down on rashes. Also, lots of powder and/or oil or lotion. Which ever you prefer. Other wise enjoy it! What's your go-to diaper for daily wear and wearing at night?     </TEXT>

	<TEXT> At first, it seemed to be a bit cobbled together, but it's become much smoother. I feel that happens to any podcast though as they figure out what's going on and how they want things to run/flow. As for content, I love hearing the behind the stories of some of reddit's biggest celebrities. I also feel that things like banana for scale and such are so fleeting that it's like trying to hype up pogs. There one minute and gone the next. Personally though, I like hearing about the minutia and little bits of trivia that not everyone might not know about stories and people. </TEXT>
