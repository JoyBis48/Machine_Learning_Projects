	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I know that they only are sold in South Korea, but I would really love it if someone could send some my way. I live in Arizona and if you need my info message me.

I would be willing to send well, snacks, or anything you might need.
Ex: toiletries and the box of chips like [this](http://i.walmartimages.com/i/p/00/02/84/00/04/0002840004026_500X500.jpg)

So if you live in South Korea and can get them, please, do contact me!

EDIT: Still looking for some. :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I love to sleep. I'd come home from school and go straight into my bed. I like the warmth the blankets give off, sure it's not like a humans but its better than nothing. I also have cute purple panda stuffed animal who sleeps next to me.
But on Friday, the 28th, it didn't happen this way. I had done something I shouldn't have ever done. I sent a nude to a girl while I'm currently with someone else.
(Note: I did this before in my last relationship and, well you can guess the outcome.) I am the worst when it comes to keeping thing like this a secret. The guilt was eating me so I told my girlfriend what I had done. Needless to say, she was pissed. Now, I've only had depression or at least enough to where it stands out enough to be noticed and medicated, since my last relationship. I should have learned from my mistakes, but hey, I'm a teenager! Since I'm a teenager I jumped from point A to suicide. I'm the type of person who just wants to die all the time, and this whole mess just messed me up. I do already have my own disabilities like ADD and so on. So anyways any moment where my downstairs kitchen room was clear I would run an take some pills. In all I had taken 15 anti depressants, my last 2 ADD pills, and about 25ish+ painkillers. To my surprise I didn't die, I only got some pain in my leg, feeling like a baby was kicking my stomach, and my vision messed up for a while. I do wish I had died. I had found the love of my life, and well.. Messed up. Don't get me wrong my current girlfriend is amazing! But I have this connection with the girl I dated first (We will call her Kat). I just always want to be close to her and protect her. Kat actually wanted me back once but I decided to go out with my current girlfriend (We will call her Hannah). Because Hannah has liked me since gosh knows when, she always cares and asks me things, and also plays games with me. Kat has moved on, and of course, to one of my friends. I know I should get jealous ad or upset over these things, but I can't help it. I should be the one she sleeps with her head on. I do not make the best choices. I mean I usually pick the opposite of what's good for me, and I realize that I really wanted that other choice when it's too late. I've spent sometime searching the house where I live, for the gun we keep. But I can never find it and eventually end up sitting on the nearest bed and crying. I've even tried to over dose on my birthday, my birthday!
I just wish I could sleep for the rest of my life. 
If only my pills worked. They're just too weak to give me happiness.
I'll probably make my own post tomorrow, seeing as I can't get on the computer right the moment, as its 2:45am and I haven't slept in 30ish+ hours.
Good night guys, I hope you all have a lovely sleep, and wake up with a smile. </TEXT>

Current MB:
http://www.biostar.com.tw/app/en/mb/introduction.php?S_ID=545

Will this support this GFX Card:
http://www.geforce.com/hardware/desktop-gpus/geforce-gtx-690/specifications

I was thinking of getting a new motherboard, put if it can support this card, I'd rather not spend.

So, do you think these two will work together?

(P.S. I have a Intel i5 2500k CPU @ 3.3 GHz)

Any help is greatly appreciated! Thanks! </TEXT>
