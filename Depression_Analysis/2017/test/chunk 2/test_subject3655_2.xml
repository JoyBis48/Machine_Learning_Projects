	<TITLE> The Window Washer (Part 2) </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-02-19 22:06:58 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT>  nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;I hadn't planned on writing a follow up to [this] (http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2w8arl/the_window_washer/), but a few people asked what happened to me next. So here it is.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;I read the message again. And again. And again I didnt want to believe what it said. Maybe I had misread it? Or misunderstood it? No, no it was much too simple to be misconstrued. He was coming after me.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;I forced myself to snap out of it and ran over to the lifts console. I quickly pushed the lever up and waited as the lift lazily crawled upwards. I would have gone down if I could, but these kinds of machines only go down to the 14th floor. Going up was the only option.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;I couldnt help but to cringe at the leisurely speed of the lift. One Chase Plaza is only 60 stories tall, but I still had a dozen to go. I found myself nervously glancing at the railing on the roof to see if he had made it. So far so good. 49th floor...50th floor Ten left.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;I tried to get the attention of anyone working in the building, but most had already left by now. I got the attention of a janitor, but he just smiled and waved to me, oblivious to my peril. I didnt give up. Every floor I passed I pounded on the glass and yelled at the top of my lungs.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;51...52...

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;I glanced back up and froze. There he was. Looking over the railing smiling down at me. I reached towards the console to stop the lift but he laughed and shook his knife like a finger saying no. Then he ran over to the turbine collecting the wire that was hauling up the lift. To my horror, he started hacking and stabbing at, breaking the wires one thread at a time. He started panting between his hysterical laughs. *This man is a monster!*

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; I had never been more scared of anyone in my entire life. Every few hacks would send a jolt through the entire lift, it started to tilt like a ship taking on water. I moved to the raised end completely helpless. I needed to get to the roof to get off of the failing lift, but doing that forced me closer toto him. I looked down in terror at the streets below. Should I jump? Should I end things on my own terms? I shuddered, and reached for the console.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;He must have seen me because he let out a scream like no noise I had ever heard before. Nooooooo! he hissed.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;I looked up just in time to see him lose patience with the wires. He reached for the railing and launched himself over, hurling knife first at me. I yelled and dove towards the lowest part of the lift. He missed, but just barely. The entire structure shuddered under the impact. Before I knew it he was back on his feet and charging at me. I backed up until I could feel the cold metal railing behind me, I had no where to go. Like the woman had been in her office, I was trapped.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;In a final act of desperation I jumped into the air and slammed myself down as hard as I could onto the failing lift. The cables buckled under the pressure and nearly snapped. It sent a shockwave through the lift and sent us both off our feet. I expected it though and grabbed on. He didnt. His feet went out from under him and sent him down onto his face. The knife flew out of his hands and skidded towards me.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;There was no time to think. I grabbed the knife and ran over the man. 59...60. Yes! I jumped over the roofs railing and turned to face the man, knife in hand. For the first time he wasnt smiling at me, the expression on his face was one of shock. Then it turned to anger. He began to scramble to his feet screaming. I ran to the wire coil and looked back at him. ILL KILL YOU! he screamed. That was all the motivation I needed. I swung the knife as hard as I could at the weakened wire.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;For a second I thought I hadn't cut through it, but then I heard a series of loud popping noises and a section of the lift lurched downwards. The cable snapped and the other chords began to pop one by one. Every time the lift dropped a few more feet he laughed harder and harder until the weight was too much to bear. The remaining cables snapped and the lift fell into the open air. He laughed hysterically the whole way down...

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;I was stunned. I almost couldnt move, the knife fell from my hands and followed the man to the ground. I didn't wait around for it to hit the sidewalk though, I couldnt bear to watch. I got myself together and walked back to the elevator. I got some looks for my torn up and battered uniform, but I didnt care. On my way out I asked a concierge to call the police, which she did without hesitation after she got a look at me.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;I stepped out the front door and saw the lift immediately to my left. It had landed partially on top of a parked town car, but no one seemed hurt. I looked back up at where the lift had fallen from, broken cables were swaying in the breeze. A crowd was slowly gathering around the lift, and I was pushed inwards closer to it. Thats when I realized something truly alarming, I hadn't seen the man's body yet. A chill rushed through me as my eyes darted across the lift looking for something, anything. I forced myself to walk onto it. I needed to know it was over for good, I needed to know he was dead. I didn't find him though, I found the last thing I ever wanted to see: another note.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;I picked it up, it was almost identical to the one he left on the window. It was beaten up and covered in drops of blood. I read it. *No* I read it again. *He couldnt have*

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Between tears and blood stains in the paper the message read:

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;You should have kept the knife </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT>  nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;I am the man who washes your windows. Well, I am at least if you work at One Chase Manhattan Plaza. Every day, five to five, Im outside on my lift washing windows. Window by window, floor by floor, Monday through Saturday. I know what you're probably thinking, but its not all that bad. I like to work outside, and the pay is very reasonable. And when the weather gets bad or dangerous were required to stay inside but still get paid! Score!

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;I began today as I do most every other day. I walk in the front door, take the industrial elevator all the way to the roof, and prepare my lift for a days work. After I make sure everything is safe and sound I start maneuvering the metal-death-basket over the side of the building. No matter how many times I do this, it will never cease to scare the living shit out of me. There is something about stepping off the edge and putting all of your life in the hands of a machine that you can never quite get used to. And on top of that, the only tiny holding you up is four tiny chords. If even one snaps, the whole thing is going down. But I try not to think about that. Once I'm actually out there I'm usually fine.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;When the hard part is over, I drop down to the 20th floor or so and then work my way back up. The lift is slow, and a peaceful long ride is a nice way to wake up.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Under normal circumstances I would have a partner up here with me, but weve been a little understaffed lately. By lately, I mean the past four months. New workers were supposed to be hired to fill the open spots, but the building manager has yet to find anyone suitable for the job. In other words, he doesn't want to pay for any more staff members and is putting it off for as long as possible. Technically that breaks a quite a few safety violations, but I dont mind. Its kinda nice to be alone out here.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;This kind of job can be pretty interesting too. Being a window washer gives you an unavoidable glance into the lives of 100 or so corporate employees on a daily basis. Whether they want me to or not, I get a front row seat to everything happening in their offices. On multiple occasions Ive seen employees sleeping, doing drugs, fist fighting, even fucking (sometimes a few at the same time). Ive even seen more than one example of corporate fraud. Employees always think if their desks face away from the door their privacy is being protected from wandering eyes, but in reality its the window they should be worried about.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Today actually turned out to be pretty boring though. For the most part, people either werent in their offices, or were doing actual work. How mundane. As I pulled up to the 47th floor the sun was already setting and people were going home. When I least expected it though, I stumbled upon something interesting. On the 47th floor there was an older woman shouting at some poor guy who had clearly royally fucked up. Her expensive looking suit implied she was some sort of executive, while his loose fitting dress shirt and pants made him look like a green intern. It was getting pretty intense in there, I could hear the muffled curses and threats through the glass. The man just stood there though and took what was coming to him. No matter how much she yelled and shouted, he would just stare back blankly. It was almost freaky how emotionlessly he was handling the situation.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;The man eventually left the office and the woman sighed and returned to her desk. She noticed me for the first time then, and sent me a wry smile. I thought she would be happy to take some pent up anger out on an intern, but she didnt seem to enjoy the shouting any more than he liked being shouted at. What a terrible situation, truly a lose lose for everyone. I did my best to ignore her and keep washing the windows.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Suddenly there was another commotion in her office. The intern had returned, but this time he was the one yelling at his boss. She was clearly caught off guard, as evident by the shocked look on her face. *You idiot* I thought, *you were in the clear, shes going to fucking fire you now!* Suddenly he stopped talking and turned around to shut the door. He kept his back turned for a while, I could see the woman tilting her head to try to see what he was doing. He twisted his head towards her and smiled. Then he turned to reveal what it was he had been concealing. A huge metal knife.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;I suddenly found myself paralyzed with fear. I had seen a lot through these windows, but nothing like this. Even though I was outside there was only two inches of glass between me and this psychopath. The sudden turn of events caught me completely off guard and left me almost too shocked to react. I cant even imagine how the poor woman inside must have felt. She screamed and jumped out of her chair in a helpless attempt to defend herself. It didnt do much. He rushed her, wildly screaming and swinging as he charged forward. He never stopped smiling.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;She had nowhere to run, he quickly caught her. A fine spray of red immediately stained almost an entire wall of her office. Then another. And another She laid sprawled out on the floor in a slowly growing pool of dark red. I was stunned and appalled. *This isnt happening, this isnt happening* I thought to myself, knowing full well that no matter how many times I said it it would never change what I was seeing just before my eyes.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;He left the woman dying on the floor. She was no longer screaming, I dont think she had the energy left. Before she stopped moving for good though she looked back towards me. Our eyes locked. I felt a sudden rush of sadness and grief pass over me, this woman was barely clinging to life and there was nothing I could do to help her. She kept watching me as she took her last breath.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;The man walked over her body to see what she was doing. He slowly bent down and traced her eye lineto me. Our eyes met. He saw me. He knows I had saw him. I panicked. I ran across the lift to my utility bag. Hands shaking, I fumbled through it. *Where is it?!* Yes! I grabbed my phone and tried to flip it open. I was rushing too quickly though, and the little phone went flying from my shaking hands and off the side of the building. FUCK! I looked back up at the office. What I saw before me made me jump backwards so hard I hit the back of the lift. He was standing in front of me, nose pressed up against the glass, grinning ear to ear. His loose clothes were torn and bloodied and his knife was still dripping wet. I was terrified, this man was a monster.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;He backed away from the glass for a moment to get something on the woman's desk. I couldnt see what he was doing, his back was to me. Like the woman had done, I tried to look around him and see what it was he was working on. He was hunched over whatever it was though, I couldnt see anything. Suddenly he spun around and slammed a piece of paper onto the inside of the window. A piece of tape kept it from falling and stuck it to the glass. Before I had a chance to examine it he shot me one last smirk and ran out of the office. I didnt hesitate, I went straight over to the paper. It was a note. I couldnt read the sloppy writing at first, but soon it came together.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Between tears and blood stains in the paper the message read:

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Youd better hope you make it to the roof before I do </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Mary loves to take selfies </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-02-15 19:56:17 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT>  nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Mary loves to take selfies. Whenever I see her she insists that we take at least one. It happens so much that we have a routine. She puts her purse on her right arm, and her left arm around me. I put my right arm around her, and point at her phone with my left hand.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Shes become very particular about how we take these selflies. Everything must be perfect. Our hair must be neatly combed, we must stand up straight, her phone must be positioned at a perfect angle. If something doesn't go perfectly as according to plan, Mary gets angry. Very angry.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Mary stopped taking selfies in public. There are too many distractions in public. 'Too many things that can go wrong' she says. I don't mind though; its nice to have a break from it.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Mary is at my house right now. We were just sitting on the couch looking through our selfie hall of fame. Silly selfies, serious selfies, sad selfies, the list goes on and on. She has more selfies on her phone than I can even remember taking.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;"I'm thirsty" she says, "I'm going to get something to drink"

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;I keep looking through our selfies. Swipe, swipe, swipe, swipe. Wait. What was that? Go back. What is that? You can see it in the windows reflection. Shes holding something behind me. That's odd. That isn't in our routine. I shrug and keep swiping.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Swipe, swipe, swipe, swipe, wait

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;There it is again. You can see it in the TV's reflection now. What is she holding? Does she always do this? It's a little closer to me than it was last time. I've never noticed it before. She has never mentioned it before. I should ask her about it when she comes back.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Swipe, swipe, swipe, swipe

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;You can see it in the mirror now. The mirror isn't like the window or the TV. It's much, much more clear. I see what it is now. I see what shes holding behind me. Its a knife. A big, sharp, metal knife. And its getting closer.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;I don't think, I act. I grab her purse and rifle through it. Makeup, phone charger, book, ...my heart stops. There it is. Buried at the bottom of her purse. Chills shoot down my spine. I pick it up. The metal is ice cold. The blade is razor sharp. I can't take my eyes off it. I am petrified. I am terrified.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Shes coming back. Quick, bury the knife back in the bag. Put her purse where she left it. Don't let her see, she can never know.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Every step is louder than the last. Faster! Quietly! She can never know.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Shes almost here. 

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Pick up the phone. Stop breathing so quickly. Sit still. Dont look up. She just outside the doorway now. I can see her shadow moving closer.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Shes back.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;"Ready to take a selfie?" </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Kinda reminds me of a much better version of [a picture I took playing hooky on the last day of school] (http://i.imgur.com/sWWfVDM.jpg). I'll give gold to anyone who can guess the province or state or city where this was taken. I'm willing to do that because I really don't think anyone is going to get it, but if you do I'll promise to come through!

EDIT 2: Wow! Two people, that's awesome! It was central New Jersey. What gave it away? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No, not really. LeBron is thought of as one of the greatest to ever play the game of basketball, regardless of things outside his control. Sherman isn't even necessarily the best in his position today. On top of that he's very arrogant. That being said, hes still very, very good and one of the best cornerbacks out there right now. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Richard Sherman (Seattle) and Darrele Revis (New England) are arguably the two best cornerbacks in the NFL. Them going head to head in the Super Bowl has been the cause of a lot of media attention. Tom Brady (New England) and Sherman also met once in the regular season. At the end of the game, after the Seahawks won, Richard Sherman approached Brady and said "You mad bro?". Hes known for being very arrogant and pretty full of himself.

Fast forward to the Super Bowl today. Sherman again openly taunted Revis after a blown play when he mocked his number '24' at the camera. Then the Patriots came back from a ten point deficit in the final quarter (something that has never been done in NFL history). They end up 4 points a head. Seattle look like they're about to score one final time with less than a minute left, which would have given them the lead and almost certainly the victory. Instead of safely running the ball though, Seattle elected to throw it and the Patriots came up with a miraculous interception that gave them possession of the ball for the last minute of the game. Theres a gif of Richard Sharman watching this play, he goes from all smiles as a Super Bowl champion, to completely devastated in about two seconds (it's pretty damn funny). This is him basically apologizing for being an ass, and Tom Brady respecting that. What I'm more surprised about though is whats happening outside of the picture. This was taken whils both teams got into a fairly large fight, they we're literally the only two players not fighting. I do not respect Richard Sherman as a competitor, but I very much respect him being the only person on his team not to fight and to try to make amends for being a general ass. That being said, I'm sure he would have gone right back to arrogant jerk mode if his team had won.

EDIT: By the way, LeBron James played basketball.

ANOTHER EDIT: Actually this wasn't the play with the big fight, nevermind, I'm sure he was very much involved in that. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A 2003 Special Edition [Fender Splattercaster] (http://m.imgur.com/OO7zCTv), its beautiful! I got it for about $350 a few years back, and I think that was an awesome deal. The last big special editions Fender did before that was the [Bowling Ball series] (http://m.imgur.com/eYCoxzH) which go from anywhere between $3000-$7000 these days. Hopefully ten years from now mine will be worth the same! Not that I would ever consider parting with it. Ever.

I also have an 11.something carat piece of uncut Tanzanite. I'm not married or anything, I got it from an Aftican warlord I met while in Tanzania. We weren't close, he either had no idea how much it was worth, or he was *really* trying to impress me (which didn't work, I didn't know it was worth anything until I was back home for a few years). Fast forward 15 years and the Tanzanite mines are going dry and the price is skyrocketing. I plan on selling it 7-10 years down the road when the market is completely under supplied . Right now Tanzanite is worth about $700 a carat, but an appraiser told me that it's price could triple in a decade. Maybe I'll be able to but another Splattercaster! </TEXT>
