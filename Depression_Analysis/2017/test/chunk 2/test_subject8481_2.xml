	<TEXT> Rocket salad?  I think they meant *roquette* salad, which is a kind of arugula.  I bet the Italian menu says roquette, but they just assumed rocket would be the English version. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The company I work for was featured on How it's Made. The producers genuinely want to know how everything is built from beginning to end. We must have spoken with their writers a dozen times so that they had a deep understanding of the entire process. It was quite the experience.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I travel for work constantly, I'm actually writing this in an airport. My best tip is to eliminate checked baggage. This won't help if you're going on vacation, but I can't tell you how many time this has saved me. 

Tight connect? Your luggage doesn't get left behind. 

Want to grab an earlier connecting flight? The first thing they'll ask is if you have checked luggage. 

If you eliminate checked luggage, you can literally walk off the plane and to your car or hop into a cab without breaking stride. 

This goes without saying, but the airline can't lose your luggage if its with you. 

Note:  Please use only approved size luggage for carry on travel. If I see you on a flight with your whole life in multiple suitcases, I'll recline my seat into your lap as far as it can go.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> People who board flights out of turn. When they call seating zone 3, if you're in zone 4, the agent at the counter should turn you away. But no one ever gets turned away! They just let them right on the plane like a reward for being bold enough to try or something. As a guy who travels for work, this drives me nuts.  </TEXT>
