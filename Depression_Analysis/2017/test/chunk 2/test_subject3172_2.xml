	<TEXT> I read in a book once about an idea for a machine that could take your brain out of your body and fit both it and your body with transceivers so you'd keep functioning as your brain communicated with your body. 

So your body is outside the glass container holding your brain, and you think, "Here I am looking at my brain. Wow." Then you realize, "Wait, shouldn't I be thinking 'Here I am with my body looking at me'?"

I think the book was by Raymond Smullyan. </TEXT>

Owning a plane means you don't spend hours in departure lounges every time you travel for business, or have to take an inefficient route through a commercial hub. When your job is basically to be in charge of billions of dollars, the time you save is more valuable than the cost of the plane. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The problem that this county wants to address isn't "some people are homeless," it's "some people are bad." Check out [this article in the conservative opinion magazine Commentary](http://www.commentarymagazine.com/article/be-open-handed-toward-your-brothers-1/) that starts out saying we should try to improve the lot of the poor, but Step 1 is "personal moral transformation." Many people in power view prison as a tool for moral transformation -- be righteous or be punished. This is part and parcel of that worldview. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I lived a couple of blocks north of there for two years, and the distance was rarely a problem. Of course most of my classes were in the northwest corner of campus, so I didn't have far to go anyway.

If you can walk to 29th and Lamar, the 338 bus goes to the HEB at Hancock Center. (It may be shorter to walk to 24th and Lamar from where you'll be.) Also the 21 bus goes from the campus area to the Fiesta Mart at 38th and I-35, which is also a short walk under the highway from that same HEB. And Wheatsville Co-op is on Guad at 31st; it's a bit pricey on most items, but you can get some basics there without spending too much.

EDIT: Also, The 338, the 3, and the 22 (the same as the 21 only going the other way) also go to or near Central Market on North Lamar, which is basically an upscale HEB.  </TEXT>

I can't help noting the implication here: That Tropicana, Simply Orange and other brands' juice all come from the same place, they just get slightly different flavor profiles when the shipment is split up between them.

Not that OJ is unique in this regard ... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In general, if the original increase was keeping pace with inflation, then it wasn't a *real* increase, only a *nominal* one -- it looked like it was going up, but it was only because the counting system in use was being degraded by inflation. It's confusing the measuring stick (dollars) with the thing it represents (purchasing power).

	<TEXT> Pornography is objectifying -- we don't see the participants as fully realized people. If there's a story involving the participants, it's basically just a frame to get their bodies together. Erotica engages more of our brain, shows us the characters as people with a full set of desires.

It's not a clear dividing line; some porn does some humanizing, for instance. It's a spectrum. </TEXT>
