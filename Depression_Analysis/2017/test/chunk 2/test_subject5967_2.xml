St. Louis is clinging to a one game lead in the division going into the final series of the season, so they still have a lot to play for. Arizona has all but given up. Michael Wacha is pitching for the Cardinals and I think he'll have a good game.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm betting on a lot of baseball games on Thursday, it's hard to pick just one potd. I'll go with the **Giants/Padres under 6.5**. The Giants have not been hitting the ball well lately and the Padres haven't hit the ball well all year. On top of that, Andrew Cashner is pitching for San Diego. He shut down SF last week. Yusmeiro Petit has been one of the most consistent pitchers for the Giants over the last month and a half. 


My other picks for the day are **DET ML**, **MIL ML**, **WAS ML** and, **TB/BOS over 8.5**. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In the last week, the only two Giants hitters who have shown any consistency are Gregor Blanco and Joe Panik. Posey, Sandoval, Pence, Belt, Crawford and Perez look lost. 


Edit: I considered the over 6. Hudson's last start against LA he didn't retire a batter in the second inning. He looked bad against the Padres last time out too. The problem I have with the over 6 is that he's going to be on a short leash. He won't be in the game long enough to allow 6 runs. On top of that, Kershaw is pitching for LA.



Edit: Decided to parlay Dodgers ML and over 6.   </TEXT>

I pay $10/month to be able to listen any song at any time. You can get a free trial to see if it's worth it. I even got a 3 month's for the price of one deal when I signed up.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I like the value of the **KC Royals** ML. They're the underdog and they're playing a team with a nearly identical record, but they have a better pitcher pitching. I think they're worth a bet. 



I also like the **under 6** on the **Dodgers/Giants** game. Bumgarner has absolute ownage against the Dodgers in his career. Greinke is pitching for LA and the Giants haven't been hitting lately. It might also be worth putting a unit on the Giants ML. They're underdogs, but I think there's good value there.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I got tired of my usual workout music. I had always been a fan of certain songs on The Dark Knight Rises score because they made made feel like Batman training in a prison cell, so I set out to find equally motivating music. I took mainly from the work of Hans Zimmer (TDKR, TDK, Pirates of the Caribbean, Gladiator, Man of Steel, Inception, The Lone Ranger), but there are a few other artists in the playlist. It's mostly upbeat, but has the occasional slower pace, which makes the eventual build up even more epic and motivational. 



Give it a listen and let me know what you think. Tell me if there's a song I should add to or remove from the list. I'm by no means knowledgeable about this kind of music, so I'm sure there are plenty of awesome songs that I don't know about. 



[Here is the finished product]( http://open.spotify.com/user/swolebuddha/playlist/1gQZicqZROQnFYsbQO0Zp7). I hope it serves you well. </TEXT>
