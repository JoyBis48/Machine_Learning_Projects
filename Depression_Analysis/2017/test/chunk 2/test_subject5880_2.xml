	<TEXT> I had just moved in, living with a friend of mine and his family. Me and my friend both shared a room, with me on top bunk and him on the bottom,  and I made a point to screw with him every now and then. My friend was out for the night, not going to return until late, and I knew that he was out smoking and would come back home still super high, as he had done the last couple nights before. 

I took some of his clothes, put them in his bed, and filled them with rolled up towels, ie pajama pants with rolled up towel legs with a bit of towel sticking out the bottoms - just enough to place socks on the end. I used a backpack to imitate the size of a torso, towels as arms, and a snowboarding helmet as a head.

I then covered the fake person in his bed with the blanket, leaving the feet sticking out, making it look like a person was passed out in his bed face down. 
http://imgur.com/oO0w7Xo ,   http://imgur.com/EAXeEWG

Fast forwarding, I'm up on the top bunk and I hear his car pull in. He heads up to his room, turns the lights on, and just stares in disbelief at his bed for several minutes straight. He doesn't move, just stares, trying to comprehend what the hell is going on, why there are no extra cars in the driveway, so who is passed out on the bottom bunk? Eventually he just couldn't handle it. He turns the lights off and walks out. I then hear a car door close, engine start, garage door open, followed by him just noping the fuck out and leaving to go sleep somewhere else.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not so much insight, just lots of experience with it working on the fogger. The screws naturally rise out a bit by themselves in the fogger, and screwing them down tight keeps the resistance low, however if I want an ohm or two higher, I'll keep one of the screws slightly less tight.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There are two resources I can't recommend enough. 

+1 800-273-8255
/r/SuicideWatch 

People call all the time. I've called twice and it's a great resource to have. 

I've also had this same struggle of a wonky sleep schedule due to depression, and the inability to gather thoughts due to anxiety. I always feel like I'm sad as hell, but don't know exactly what or how to talk about it. Going to sessions again and again makes it easier and easier to collect thoughts - it's hard and I feel like it's almost something that takes practice. 

Best of luck, friend.

	<TEXT> I've got the opposite advice of tropical walrus. If your atomizer has fallen below 1 ohm, you might be able to unscrew the screws just a tiny bit to increase the resistance. Else, my friend with an istick just unscrews the atomizer from the istick just a tiny bit and it increases the resistance - this is with a nautilus, however. 

Also, your MVP will fire anything greater than 0.7 ohms. The istick fires anything equal to or greater than 1 ohm.  </TEXT>

Or the insulator around the 510 pin is twisted and not preventing the positive current from running into the negative current, causing a short.

	<TEXT> I would learn to overcome my fear of water brought on by the drowning of my father by sneaking into a large sailboat and sailing into the open ocean, where I'm met with a horrible sadistic storm that is ever increasing in intensity. As a response I tie myself to the ship and scream at the sky, accepting my death, until the storm eventually passes, I dry off, and suddenly crash my boat into the edge of the world as I know it. The head of my boat cracks through a wall painted to look like a skyline, and I immediately notice a set of painted stairs leading up the painted wall. As the set of stairs leads me to a door which reads "exit", I meet my real father who lives in the moon, and offers me a life encompassing ultimatum: Either I stay with him and continue to live in a world where everyone is watching me, or I venture into the open world. In response to his ultimatum, I open the door reading "exit", after saying

"Good morning, and in case I don't see ya, good afternoon, good evening, and good night!" </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Got into my account. I don't know if it was a matter of the services being back online or what I did, but I'll share how I got into the account just in case it's a solution.

Started up CoD Advanced Warfare signed into a different account on the Xbox. Notification said Press whatever button (Select on the 360) to switch profiles. Did so. Put in password. Viola.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Question.

I'm trying to play single player via Xbox One, however my account requires a password in order to sign in. On the 360 you could just unplug the ethernet cable to sign in without a password. Is there an equivalent on the Xbox One? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 30+mg? That sounds like flavor hell - nicotine really dulls down flavor.

Have you considered that having a higher power device allows you to drop nicotine levels because you're producing more vapor in each hit? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Great company with nice customer service in my opinion.

My last order was from them on 10/2/14. I ordered GWAR Bloodbath and a refill on Hawk Sauce. The Hawk Sauce I got was pretty different than usual   bad - it tasted like 50%Hawk Sauce and 50%Thug Juice. The Bloodbath was absolutely incredible, though. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sounds like me

Except the events were all true, and I'm a man. I had like the worst luck in the world getting to work, cars constantly breaking down no matter which one I drove,  my favorite dog passing away, landed in the hospital for breakdowns, storming out because I hated my job, etc.

	<TEXT> There's a fine line between the amount of long distance driving that calms my nerves, and the amount that has me horribly on edge. 

Driving long distance is horribly anxiety provoking for me, and I've been dreading this trip for the past month or so now. 

I have this irrational fear of my own fear, that I'll panic, lose contact with reality, lock up in traffic and crash, and crashing somewhere completely unknown frightens me.

 These last couple of months I've actually experienced what I'm telling myself is a new symptom of anxiety - having trouble breathing. I've experienced a whole bucket of symptoms, but never this common one. These last few days (it's horrible right now), I've been having to yawn or try to inhale as deeply as possible to scoop a deep breath out of myself, because I feel as if there is something in my upper chest/bronchi preventing me from taking a deep breath. This adds to my fear, because I of course have that part of my brain which is convinced it's always cancer, and I'm worried about suddenly not being able to breath halfway through my trip. 

I also have the worst of luck with cars, and I'm also naturally scared of breaking down somewhere and spending Christmas somewhere halfway between my starting point and destination. 

Thank you for reading -  any words of encouragement are greatly appreciated! I've struggled for some years and seen treatment both from a hospital environment and one on one therapy, however reminders and support will be much appreciated. </TEXT>
