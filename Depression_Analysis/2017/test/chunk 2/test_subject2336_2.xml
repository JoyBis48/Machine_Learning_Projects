	<TEXT> Actual film composition is all conjecture at this moment as we know absolutely nothing about:

a.) shared screen time.

b.) Lex's power suit (armani or armor)

I'm just talking looking at them side by side in the abstract.  Eisenberg is known for playing an introverted nerd type and Cavill is ripped - even if not to comic standards (much like the airbrushed standards women face).  

I'm just saying, in terms of spirit - they are quite opposite.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I kind of like this casting.  They can go a lot routes with this character - specifically in the contrasting looks between Superman and Lex.  Just physically, when you look at them, you know where their strengths lie. 

They can play off Lex's need to be adored - and maybe that jealousy of Superman plays into his working out and bulking up.  

I would suggest reading these to get a better look at their complex relationship:
