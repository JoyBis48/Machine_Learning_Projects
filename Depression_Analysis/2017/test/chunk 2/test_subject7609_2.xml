	<TEXT> I didn't think it was his best work either, but still overall a great read. The thing about Slaughterhouse Five (and most of what I've read of Vonnegut) is some of the passages in the book just stand out, and are unforgettable. Someone posted here the other day the excerpt about the poor in America, so I'll throw this one out there instead -

The visitor from outer space made a serious study of Christianity, to learn, if he could, why Christians found it so easy to be cruel. He concluded that at least part of the trouble was slipshod storytelling in the New Testament. He supposed that the intent of the Gospels was to teach people, among other things, to be merciful, even to the lowest of the low.

But the Gospels actually taught this:

Before you kill somebody, make absolutely sure he isnt well connected. So it goes.

The flaw in the Christ stories, said the visitor from outer space, was that Christ, who didnt look like much, was actually the Son of the Most Powerful Being in the Universe. Readers understood that, so, when they came to the crucifixion, they naturally thought, and Rosewater read out loud again:

Oh, boythey sure picked the wrong guy to lynch _that_ time!

And that thought had a brother: There are right people to lynch. Who? People not well connected. So it goes." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not really into CS, but in League when someone on your team sucks, they end up feeding the other team which inherently makes that member of the other team a lot more powerful. If they're bad enough, they will make someone on the other team so powerful that they have essentially singlehandedly lost the game for your team, all the while you have to suffer and play against someone who is a lot more powerful than you are until the game is over. You likely end up dying a lot due to something out of your control.

Not an excuse to be an asshole, but a possible explanation of why League/DOTA can be really frustrating. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You are getting downvotes because you are whining and stating things that aren't actually correct. I did not downvote you, but I'll try to address your points fairly.

* **It's mostly luck-based.** Yes, this game is not chess, it is a card game. All card games are based on a mixture of skill and luck. Just becuase there are RNG minions, does not mean the game is total luck though. Have you ever played poker? It's a game based on calculating odds based on known and unknown factors. I'll take your mad bomber example - Let's say I have a 3/1 divine Shield, and you have 3 minions, one of which is a blood imp. Is it worth mad bombering here? How important is getting rid of your blood imp to me? Can I afford to have the bomber hit my own life total or get rid of my shield? Should I save the bomber for a more opportune moment or do I need the 3/2 body to keep tempo? Should I attack first, increasing the odds of hitting your blood imp but potentially allowing my 3/1 to be killed? Am I playing into board sweep or setting up a potentially bad trade based on what I'm anticipating you to have? Do you have Hellfire in hand?

  Sometimes your mad bomber just kills your 3/3, and yeah, that is super unlikely and really sucks, but to claim there is no strategy because of it? That is not true.

  Cards like Blood Knight are perfectly fine. It is a sick answer to a metagame dominated by argent squires to catch people unaware. A mediocre card that is really good against certain deck types - literally every competitive CCG has cards like this.

* **It's Pay-To-Win.** Hearthstone has just about the least offensive model of any CCG. Solforge? Far worse. Magic? Hahaha. The top constructed decks have around 1-5 legendary cards in them, with Druid Control generally being the most expensive. I practically have this entire deck after one or two months without spending a dime - I'm missing two of the five legendaries. Also, the legendaries AREN'T EVEN THAT GOOD OR GAMESHAPING! Most are niche cards, with exceptions being Sylvanas and maybe Rag. You do not need legendaries to be competitive. Crafting them is also very easy and not nearly as hard as you make it to be. I've crafted two legendaries in a month or two without even disenchanting anything besides duplicates. Not to mention you can craft any card you want - unlike other games where you need to just keep cracking packs.

* **One of the two game modes sits behind a paywall.** No, this is pretty much a huge exaggeration. Yes, arena costs 150 gold or $1.99. Daily quests give you anywhere from 40 to 100 gold, and you get 10 gold per 3 constructed wins. Not only that, but winning in arena GIVES YOU MORE GOLD. Going 7-3 gives you over 150 gold! Arena is far from random and very skill based. Many, many players are able to average 7-12 wins per run. Also, stating that Blizzard has reduced the rewards is just a straight up lie - they actually INCREASED them nearly across the board when they made the move to 12 being the maximum win number. I have never paid for arena and do one or more nearly every day.

So yeah, that is probably why you are getting the downvotes </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Seriously? Solforge is pretty fun but it is super pay to win. The free to play rewards I get are most often a small amount of silver and a common I have numerous copies of. The Drafts are great, but as a f2p player expect to be able to play one every week if you're lucky.

Constructed is really dependent on legendaries (hope you got lucky and have 3 Thundersaurs!) and incredibly unbalanced - at least when N/T Shapers was completely dominant you only needed a few legendaries - Zimus, Phoenix, etc. Now that A/U Weirwood Thundersaur is the best deck by a country mile, hope you have thundersaurs, blightsteel gargoyles, 2/4 free robot guy, etc </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's not true at all. It's simple, but it has a lot of decisions. Obviously it relies on random factor, but so does every card game. Arena in itself has 30 decisions just when making the deck. Then there are decisions to be made with the mulligan process, with which creature to attack, when to attack your opponent's creatures rather than go to the face, trying to predict what your opponent's possible responses to your plays are, etc. What you are saying is simply wrong </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah. I might keep truesilver because it's just so good, but most of the time, I think just being able to play out a 2-3-4 or 2-2-3-4 with the coin start usually just trumps keeping a good card. Getting behind in this game is pretty brutal and I believe coming out strong is pretty important for arena.

Plus, this game 9 times out of 10 just gives you back the cards you mull anyways, so you might just get that sick 4 drop back ;) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> One of those cases where it depends. Is it a 3 card or 4 card hand? What does the curve of your deck look like? How many 2 drops are you running? How awful would it be to drop your hero power turn 2? (Pally being not ideal, warrior completely awful?) Hearthstone is more complex than most make it out to be.

Yeti is obviously a top 4 drop, and if you manage to draw into something to play on turn 2/3, slamming a yeti turn 4 is obviously awesome. All I can really say is know your deck. Sometimes I'll have a deck with nuts lategame (3 flamestrikes or something like that) and not enough lower drops. In that case, I'd throw the yeti back, as I know I'd be drawing lategame power. Other times your curve just looks like a diagonal line from 2 drops down, so there I'd probably keep the yeti in hopes of out-tempoing my opponent and winning quickly.

In most general cases, I'd likely throw it back on a 3 card hand, and keep it (assuming it's the sole keeper) in a 4 card hand. I know "it depends" isn't the ideal answer, but it's the case here. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Pick 5: I'd take the 5/4 Taunt over mirror image, but it's probably close

Pick 6: Definitely frostbolt. Frostbolt Is one of the top cards you can get in a mage draft, murloc tidehunter is not very good.

Pick 8: Really don't like ice lance, I'd just take the 2/3.

Pick 10: Twilight Drake over counterspell. Twilight Drake often gets silenced but when he doesn't he's like a chillwind yeti or better. counterspell is ok but not as good

Pick 17: worgen infiltrator, or mana wyrm over mirror image. Not really a big mirror image fan, you probably overvalue it a bit.

Pick 18: your 2 slot is filling up but i'd probably still take faerie dragon over stormwind champ

pick 28: shieldmasta. Curve is important, but you're placing a bit too much importance on it.  Still take really good cards like shieldmasta over mediocre ones like argent squire.

pick 29: you can never have enough frostbolts

 ----------------------

Not horrible but a couple of mispicks. You don't need to deliberate over frostbolt, it's a slam every time unless there's something else like flamestrike, fireball, water elemental, etc

	<TEXT> Don't fret - many of us have been playing card games for almost 20 years. As long as you keep learning from making mistakes, you will keep improving.

**Step 1: Drafting your arena deck**

Look over tier lists - the following lists are very helpful references. Do not be afraid to do a few drafts directly following the tier lists. The more drafts you do, the more you will get a feel for which cards are very good and which are not, and you can deviate a bit based on personal preference.

http://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/1ujhzo/antigrav1tys_arena_draft_tier_list/

http://www.ihearthu.com/trumps-arena-card-rankings/

http://www.ihearthu.com/vivafringes-guide-to-arena/

**Step 2: Draft mana curve**

Ideally, you want to balance tier lists with mana curve. Don't pass up something like Argent Commander for a mediocre 2 drop, but you want to be able to have enough 2 drops to be able to curve out (2 drop on turn 2, 3 drop on turn 3, 4 drop on turn 4). Having around 6 2 drops you can actually play on turn 2 is a good metric to start with.

Practice makes perfect. Although it's work, write down all 30 of your picks (including all 3 cards and what you chose) and post it here. You'll get a critique from a large amount of people who will quickly show you your faults - and if you don't, PM me and I'll look it over. It will be super helpful in seeing if it's the cards you're picking that's the problem.

**Step 3: Draft Classes**

Don't be afraid to pick "overpowered" classes. I pick mage every time it comes up and if mage isn't there, I'll pick paladin. The point of the game is to win. Your mileage may vary, but mage and paladin are generally considered two of the more powerful classes.

**Step 4: Mulligans**

On the play, you want to have a 2, 3, and 4 drop. On the draw, coin gives you options but try for a 2-2-3-4, 2-4-4, or a 3-3-4 start. You generally always want a 2 drop in hand. If you draw 3 4 drops, mull them all, unless one is something really insane. Anything over 4 do not keep is a good arena rule of thumb.

**Step 5: Gameplay**

Always be thinking of what gets you the most value. At worst you want to trade one of your cards for theirs. In general you want to look to get added value. Getting 2 cards with one of yours is how you win games. If you play a shattered sun cleric and trade with the 3/3 taunt bear, you get small value because you traded a 3 drop for a 3 drop but still have the battlecry on another creature. Small value adds up and wins games.

Finally, don't give up - once it clicks, you'll be rattling off 8+ wins every time. Good luck </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Black Knight is a literal game winner. Eating a shieldmasta or sunwalker is such a huge tempo shift. Worst case he's an expensive Chillwind Yeti, which is obviously worse than Illidan, but it isn't very hard to get insane value from him.

Illidan usually needs to survive a turn to provide good value, otherwise he is kind of mediocre. The Beast is usually just pretty bad. Usually just eats removal and gives your opponent a free guy. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, I see the appeal (though not for me) and liking it is one thing, but I can't imagine people enjoying it so much that it made their top ten lists. Have people here put hours into Divekick? Is there an active online community to it?

In a year with so many good games, I just question seeing it listed above some others. </TEXT>

Just because people are currently packing bad cards like Fan of Knives to deal with Warlock Rush doesn't mean that a 1/1 stealth with a super powerful ability would be worse than a plain 2/2 that literally dies to nearly anything other than a hero ability </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Card advantage is important, but the MOST important thing in this game is tempo and curve. In arena, if you miss a turn 1 and 2 drop on the play and don't have a plan, like a turn 4 hellfire or consecration, most cases you won't be able to keep up with a t1 coin into a 2 drop t2 2 drop t3 3 drop t4 4 drop.

From there, it's all about getting card advantage and making value trades. Rarely is there any "drop it and I win" cards like mtg (Gideon Jura in Rise draft, baneslayer angel, etc) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This card is currently not playable in constructed, but can be a very good card in arena. It is deck dependent, but in a shaman, paladin, or a low curve deck with lots of guys, it can be insane.

Regarding it being win-more, I don't think that is true. Just because you have minions on board does not mean you are winning. When you drop him, it allows you to instantly make favorable trades and get a ton of value. It lets you trade a 2-drop 2/3 and a 1/1 paladin token for something like a chillwind yeti. In this case you might even be behind on board, and the champion lets you surge back with all sorts of favorable trades.

If you are slightly winning, he lets you get even more value, wipe any threats they have while trading up, and secures his own safety from on board minions. If your opponent does not instantly deal with him, you will likely win.

Certainly an underrated arena card IMO. </TEXT>

The game is speculated to be in the $20-30 range on release, so I don't see what the big deal is.

	<TEXT> The comment thread here literally makes me want to vomit. Could you guys try and dismiss this any harder? Some assholes jack off into this dev's phone and all you can talk about is how she probably faked the whole thing?

 "Cyber Self Harm" (It weirdly exists http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-25120783) as it's pretty easy to garner sympathy that way. If it is option b I don't get why she elected to do it on such a small image board, maybe it's because like I said a thread about this on /v/ was just full of people who had no idea who she was.


 Could possibly be option B. How did the image board get that photo of her?


 this seems to be a quest for attention


 blowing it out of proportion


 We can discuss it and condemn them all we went but that won't change a thing.


 As a developer is listing your gender a requirement to get something Green-lighted?


 To me it sounds all fishy...


 she didn't have to state that she was female


 I have a feeling that SJW's are going to use minimal or fake "backlash" or harassment to garner more attention to their creative endeavors


 The victim complex is a million dollar industry for feminism, and you're just seeing it take root in their newest infection via gaming


 With that said, I'm skeptical of this.


Fucking Shameful.

Edit: and the mods actually put misleading title on this....fuck this sub

Keeping the wurms at 4 seems good, but assuming it's constructed and not arena, SW:D isn't that highly played anymore (or is it? seems like I've been seeing less and they aren't very good), and you are going to get SW:P'd on his turn 2 if he has it regardless. </TEXT>

* T2 mirror entirty -  mirror entity

* T3 arcane intellect, or one of your drawn spells if it gives you a better option


Leaving you with a 5/3 and 4/3 with 4 0/2 taunts the priest is going to struggle to get through. I don't think you wait to play the second mirror entity. Maybe if he has a SW:P turn 2 to kill one of your wurms, but even then I think I'd still just jam both of them out.
