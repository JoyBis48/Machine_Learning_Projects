	<TEXT> advocating for 'traditional marriage'

Her motivation for advocating traditional marriage is her own moral beliefs. That does not equate to her hating anyone. You are doing what the Left frequently does which is to assume anyone who has a different viewpoint must have an evil intention behind it. If someone stands for traditional marriage then they must be anti gay. Anyone opposed to Obama's policies must be a racist. 

I actually listen to Glenn Beck and he has never stated any anti LGBT attitudes at all.

Religious people should not be forced to bake LGBT cakes just as LGBT bakers should not be forced to bake Westboro Baptist cakes. The government shouldn't force anyone to bake any cake that conflicts with their personal or business philosophies. 

The other article is about a woman who questioned the methods of GLAAD but was not anti LGBT.

	<TEXT> I don't know who David Klein is but your link authored by him is simply his uneducated opinion. Nothing more.


I assume he is referring to Goldberg's book "Liberal Fascism". The term Liberal Fascism was derived from a speech made by George Orwell in the 1930's. Goldberg's book of the same name is fully footnoted and extremely well researched. 

In that book, Goldberg describes the various versions of socialism that was being created and discussed around the early part of the 20th century. Naziism and Fascism were two  forms of socialism.

Hitler and Mussolini were both serious writers of socialist political philosophy and championed its use as a fairer system than capitalism. Each created a unique brand of socialism that they felt was better and fairer than the previous versions of socialism offered by others up til them.

Both systems retained the classical elements of standard socialism including non private ownership of thee means of production (and distribution), a planned economy, and a government/community centric society at the expense of individual freedom. Both also offered unique elements that only their form of socialism featured. 

I am sorry that you don't agree with historical fact. Some think that fire can't bend steel and that 9/11 was an inside job. If you wish to contest proven historical fact then please offer your own proof. Goldberg's book is full of footnotes. Can you refute any of them? 

To repeat an overused cliche, the truth hurts. The Nazis and the Fascists were true socialists. 

Never be afraid of the truth. Good luck </TEXT>

No one has mentioned the 40's. All Conservatives want is smaller government, less taxes, less regulation. It is our contention that government is out of control. It expands every year in its scope, size, and influence in the people's lives. Power is a zero sum game. Power is finite. The bigger slice of the power pie that the government takes must come at the expense of the people's freedom and liberty.

	<TEXT> Though from space it looks like a impact crater or the remnants of an ancient volcano, the Kondyor Massif, in Russia, is neither. Rather it is in what's known in geological terms as an "intrusion." An intrusion forms when molten magma of igneous rock crystallizes below the surface of the earth, in this case forming a perfectly circular rocky ring over a billion years ago. (Because they form underground, intrusions are also known as plutons, named for Pluto, the Roman god of the underworld.) Harder then the rest of the earth around it, the Kondyor Massif intrusion (in this case an alkaline-ultrabasic massif intrusion) has slowly made its way through 5000 miles of mantle and is now visible on the surface of the earth. A stream flows out from its center, fueled by the snow waters melting from the Kondyor Massif's 2000-foot-high rim. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Marx wrote of a transition from capitalism via socialism into communism. The end game is ultimately community ownership of everything. Socialist theory has always stated such. Progress to the Left does not mean a general improvement of society or a fairer system. Progress means a march towards a specific, rigid, Leftist, ideology. 

Some assume Sweden or Norway like states are the goal of socialist societies. It is not. Those states are merely transitory, stepping stones along a path that ultimately leads to true and rigid socialism.

All you said was the Dems are for tax cuts which they clearly oppose

If you think this, then you have literally never picked up a history textbook. Socialism has always been characterized, and in fact, requires, sudden and violent change.

You may want to reread your Marx comrade. I think you missed a few chapters. The process from capitalism to communism is a long march not a sudden violent explosion:

Clearly neither socialism not the Democrat Party favors anti ethnic or anti sexual identity policies regardless of past transgressions. 

Today's Democrat Party is in lock step with all of the elements of classical socialism. 

Socialism is a long march towards a definite destination. At first there is a period where socialism exists along side capitalism. It exploits Capitalism and co-opts it. Rather than outright government/community ownership of the means of production, socialism at first controls industries via crony Capitalism and regulatory favoritism. Eventually, socialism evolves from a parasitic relationship with its Capitalist host and kills it and instilling all classical aspects of socialism (ultimately to communism) </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Democrats are trying to fight for an increase in size of the traditional middle class. This is not something that socialism supports - socialism supports classless society.

What policies specifically?

Tax cuts for the middle class. Socialism would not support tax cuts, period.

Absolute and total lie. Name Any tax cut proposed by the Democrats

Tax-cuts for small businesses. Socialism supports large state-owned companies, not small businesses.

Absolute and total lie. Name Any tax cut proposed by the Democrats

Pro-immigration reform. Socialism does not jive with multicultural societies.

Immigration reform is designed only to create dependent Democrat voting block. As for multiculturalism, no such limitations are a part of any socialist ideology except for Naziism. Isn't Cuba multicultural?

LGBT rights. Again, socialist countries across the world have pretty much never encouraged this, to the point at which you could be punished.

Socialism dictates no such restrictions on sexual identity except for the Nazis

Freedom of speech. Also isn't supported by socialism

There is no debate within the Democrat Party. Ever been to a college campus? Dissenting opinions/viewpoints are forbidden and routinely shouted down or silenced as hate speech, micro aggressions etc

	<TEXT> Please provide proof that fracking causes ground water pollution. Fracking has been used for nearly 100 years. It has a great safety record. The only danger is rare cases of tiny leaks caused by equipment failure. These rare cases release the same amount of oil as a vehicle crash and a fuel tank rupture. 

Seriously, if you reject the scientific facts of fracking then you oppose it for religious reasons. If so, I believe you have the right to belong to any faith based belief system you choose but don't try to force everyone else to join also. I am an atheist and I don't want to join anyone's religion. Even if it is Gaia based environmentalism.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well failures are rare. They typically involve defects in the well shaft casing. Any leakage of anything is quickly discovered via a drop in pressure in the well. Ground water and the fracking chemicals and gas and oil produced are separated by thousands of feet of earth and many layers of impermeable shale.

Thus, the only way for anything to contaminate water is via a defect in the pumping equipment or defect in the well casing. Such defects can be quickly fixed.

	<TEXT> I agree the various socialistic systems seek to achieve the same end game via differing paths but they all end up at the same destination ultimately. That is a planned economy,  non privately held means of production and distribution (whether held by "the community" or by government), and a government (or community) centric society at the expense of personal freedom.

 As for fascism, that and Naziism were true socialist ideologies. You listed some of the unique elements of their brand of socialism but you fail to acknowledge their commonality with "classical" socialism. Fascism and Naziism featured no private ownership of the means of production (and distribution), a planned economy,  and a government (or community) centric society at the expense of personal freedom.

I disagree. There is no such thing as reform socialism. Socialism has many forms (communism, progressivism, Naziism, fascism, anarcho syndicalism, etc). Each form has distinct differences that can be considered distinct paths towards an end goal. The end goal for all systems is ultimately the same.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  He used the socialist title to as gimmick to attract followers.

Proof?

The fact is that during the late 19th and early 20th centuries many political philosophers were trying to formulate the most equitable form of socialism. Among these were Communism, Fascism, Naziism, even Anarcho Syndicalism (of Monte Python Holy Grail fame) and several others. All of these forms of socialism maintain the standard elements of classical socialism such as non private ownership of the means of production, a planned economy, and a government centric society at the expense of individual liberty. All of these forms of socialism also featured important differences such as Communism's international focus or Naziism's extreme racism. 

The study of socialism is an interesting exploration of political philosophers attempting to find the best and most equitable way to organize a society's government and economy. Sadly some of those offshutes resulted in evil regimes and systems.

All of this is well documented. I really can't grasp how you can even challenge these facts other than you feel uncomfortable that the system you favor now has some unsavory relatives in the family tree.

Arguing about this is like you trying to claim Bill Clinton wasn't a Democrat. 

I really don't know what else to say. A lot of people get confused by socialism and the Nazis because during WWII the Soviets were at war with them. Some assume that because the Soviets were against the Nazis that the Nazis must have been political polar opposites. Confusion also comes from the creation of the whole Left wing Right wing political spectrum of the French Parliament and where various politicians sat. People incorrectly assume that the spectrum of the French Parliament at the time represents the entirety of the international political spectrum we have today. 

In other words what was considered far Right or far Left in the French Parliament then is not necessarily what we would consider as being far Right or Far Left today.

Again, I don't know how you could even argue this historical fact. I suggest you take some college level political science and history classes. Being ignorant or intentionally misinformed will not serve you in life.

Good luck </TEXT>

It is an historical fact that the Nazis and the Fascists were socialists. Your definition in no way contradicts that except its incorrect claim that Fascism was "Right Wing".

The false claim that the Nazis and Fascists were right wing comes from WWII when the Soviets were at war with them. The Soviets and the Nazis and Fascists were all socialists but different, competing forms.

The EPA instead constantly expands their influence by creating law under the rubric of environmental protection. They do so without regard for the economic effects of those regulations. They do so without legal authority to do so (can't create statutes). Their policies destroy entire industries (see coal, nuclear, etc}.

	<TEXT> I am not against all regulation. I am against the endless expansion of regulation. Case in point: During the 70's the EPA created very helpful regulations on clean water and pollution. Since then, they have attempted to regulate anything even remotely relating to the environment.

These new regulations are very expensive to comply with, they are of dubious and often no value to the environment, the new regulations don't take into account economic impacts when imposed, the EPA oversteps into areas that should be regulated by congress, the EPA regulations often involve political or philosophical agendas rather than environmental protection.

Just this week, a judge ruled that the EPA can't regulate lead bullets. If the EPA had been allowed to do that then they would have unilaterally infringed on the people's 2nd amendment rights.

	<TEXT> I tire of people like you who simply cannot distinguish/differentiate/discriminate between the actions of two groups of people and feel the need to place both groups in the same moral basket. The USA and the Nazis killed thousands of people during WWII but they did so for different reasons. They are not two sides of the same coin.

 Muslim extremists have been engaging in terrorist and violent acts for centuries and against every culture they interact with. Islam is a religion based on conquest and subjugation of their rivals. Radical Islamists have been involved in thousands of religious based violent attacks in just the past 20 years. http://www.thereligionofpeace.com/index.html#Attacks (follow links to yearly lists)

The only reason the US is engaged in violent action against Muslim extremists is because they simply won't leave us alone. They have already declared war against us unilaterally. 

According to your logic, a robber who enters a store and shoots a clerk and the store owner who defends himself and shoots the robber are moral equivalents because they were both shooters engaged in violence.

If you cannot see the difference between the two or the difference between what the US does and what Muslim extremists do then you are indeed being juvenile and naive and engaged in wishful thinking.  </TEXT>

Fascism was a socialist political movement. I highly doubt many on the right would push for such a system.

Also the Democrat Party is being led to its ultimate path towards real socialism. Everyday Democrat voters are being falsely led to believe that the party only seeks an general progress towards a better future. </TEXT>

Obama can end this today. He supports drone killing without due process (I personally agree with his policy)

 restricting choices and education concerning reproduction

The abortion statutes in the EU are much more restrictive than the USA. (I personally don't give a shit about abortion either way)

invading other countries to steal their natural resources

Can you offer any proof that that has happened? Ever?

restricting human rights to only exist for whites and/or christian

Can you offer any proof that that has happened? Ever?

putting people in prison for what they do to their own bodies.

If you are referring to drugs, both parties have supported the war on drugs for a century

I don't like the world-conquest size of the defence budget, the complete neglect of how we are rapidly destroying the planet

The US defense budget keeps sea lanes open allowing world commerce. The US guarantees the security of the EU, Canada, and many other countries in the world. When there is a natural disaster, it is the US military that always offers assistance. 

Can you name a country that is a better steward of the environment?   </TEXT>

Notice how the left never has any disagreements on policy? Everyone on the Left is following a strict, static, rigid ideology.

Progressives are not promoting a general progression towards a better world. Progressivism is a strict, methodical march towards garden variety socialism. The end result is a society run by self appointed elites.

Conservatism is not an attempt to conserve tradition or the past. Conservatism is the desire to keep government small because as government expands, the personal liberty and freedom of the people must necessarily be limited.   </TEXT>

I have no friction with the religious right other than thinking they may be a distraction from our core message of limited taxation and less governmental control over the people.

I feel the bigger problem is the Left's disingenuous claims and outright lies regarding the GOP as being religious racists. I am a hardcore Tea Party Conservative who is active in politics and I simply never encounter the intolerant bible thumpers and racist/homophobic/misogynistic  types the Left always claims makes up the Right.

Now, dispute these facts if you can. The educated debate. Fools just laugh.

Also, the difference between Soros and the Kochs is that Soros thinks he has it too easy ~ that he's not being asked for enough, while the Kochs use their money and influence to further the idea that they are asked too much.

Can you see the difference?

	<TEXT> Democrat economics in a nutshell involves the government stimulating consumer consumption by giving money to the public sector via building projects, public agencies, or simply handouts. 

Conservative economics in a nutshell is to make the cost of doing business less via tax cuts and less regulatory expense. When businesses have more money they will stimulate the economy by expanding and increased hiring.

The Democrat method helps unions and special interest groups and works only so long as the money is flowing.

The Conservative method is superior because lower costs for business creates sustainable economic stimulus.
 
To paraphrase an old saying: Democrat economics is like giving a man a fish and allowing him to eat for a day. Conservative economics is like teaching a man how to fish so he can eat everyday.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Only fools and the easily led believe the economy is in good shape. We have not recovered from the Obama recession. Good jobs for college graduates are scarce. Workers have given up hope.

Here is the labor participation rate: http://www.zerohedge.com/article/labor-force-participation-rate-drops-25-year-low-645

Please explain how it is a good thing that the rate is at a 25 year low? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> These miniature helicopters are tiny, being 10x2.5 cm (4x1 inch) aircraft that are battery powered, very quiet and can stay in the air for 20 minutes per sortie. The rotor diameter is 12 cm (4.8 inches). The UAV is made of hard plastic and one can be ready for action in less than a minute. A complete set (two UAVs and the controller) weighs less than a kilogram (2.2 pounds). The operator can see (and capture) video and still photos on the hand held controller as the operator sends the PD-100 up to a kilometer away. The operator can zoom the camera. The PD-100 also carries GPS, a thermometer, compass and altitude sensor. Max speed is 10 meters a second (36 kilometers/22.5 miles an hour) and max altitude is about 500 meters. </TEXT>
