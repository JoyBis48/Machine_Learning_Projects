You really need to read up on the Revolutionary War - the nascent U.S. was heavily supported by French money, and a lot of French troops and naval forces.  There were almost as many French troops at Yorktown as American, and it was the French fleet that fought the British fleet in the Battle of Chesapeake Bay to force the British surrender at Yorktown. </TEXT>

Again, [citation needed].

Scale matters.  The Koch brothers throwing nearly a billion into an election cycle, or Sheldon Adelson cutting $10 million checks to Newt Gingrich, is slightly different from Soros tossing a million or two to a progressive PAC every now and then.

Hell, Texas oil billionaires probably spent more money on Swiftboating Kerry in 2004 than Soros has spent on Democrats *ever*. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've read two of them - *Night of Knives* was decent, because it was minimal.  It didn't try to be epic, it just told an interesting background story in a sparse, action-laden fashion.  *Return of the Crimson Guard* tried way too hard to be epic, and failed.  

ICE has a tendency towards bad prose, and just throwing a bunch of things into the story without really blending them.  He covers all the plot elements required, but not smoothly. Very choppy, jumps-around type of work.  And he frequently underwhelms with his revelations of big mysteries.  Something will get hugely built up, and then when you find out the secret, it's like ... "That's it?  Seriously?" </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> In fact, my very patient landlord waited way past 60 days, I'm more like 90 behind, and he finally sent the 30-day notice.  Currently unemployed and worked a cash job over the summer/fall, so no UI. I've scraped up one month's rent ($350), but live in a rural area where there's just no day-work, almost no social services (I have no kids, so don't qualify for any county or state - California - help), and very very few jobs available.  If I had anything valuable to sell, I would, but I never really have.

The usual work I do in the winter is dependent upon getting snow, and we (rural NE California), well, *haven't*.  I'm not looking to raise $1000 from redditors, but literally anything would help at this point.

So I'm just sort of tossing this out there with a little more than a week left.  I just wish I was a cat who needed surgery or something - I'm not a huge sob story, just financially desperate over a bad winter.

EDIT:  PM me for Paypal details. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  But for whatever reason, that shitty pre-sliced bread is really popular in the US. 

You know ... that stuff is really, really good for a couple of things.  First:  well-buttered toast.  Generic American sliced white bread just makes really good toast.  Because I don't want an overly-strong flavor like sourdough or whatever first thing in the morning.

And second, grilled-cheese sandwiches, with the equally-derided Kraft American cheese slices on them.  Two over-priced, over-processed piles of chemicals that only vaguely resemble their namesakes, but when you put them together are so goddamn delicious.

EDIT:  I'll toss in a third thing:  Cheap grade-school sandwiches with lots of mayo.  Namely, ham-and-cheese using cheap, tangy, fatty mayo and mass-produced deli sliced ham.  Or with Oscar Meyer bologna, which probably isn't even a real meat, but with enough mayo and mustard on Wonderbread is really, really tasty. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm especially talking about things with complex recipes, where the store-bought version has a long shelf-life but the home-made version has to be used fairly fast.

In my case, it's Caeser dressing - started doing so a week ago, and I'll never go back to the bottled stuff, though there are plenty of decent brands out there.  I still haven't done ranch because of the short fridge-life of buttermilk, but that's probably up next. </TEXT>
