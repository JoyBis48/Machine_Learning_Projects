	<TEXT> There are a lot of little tricks you can use to help you feel better when you are depressed.  Set a small attainable goal for yourself.  Like baking a cake from scratch.  Focus on researching the perfect recipe, focus on going out and getting the ingredients, measure and check for advice on good techniques.  You make that cake.  You eat some of that cake.  Think of your next challenge.

The best friend of depression is inactivity.  We feel tired and so we think what we want is to lie down and not think, but we just feel sick at the end of the day.  And we think, and think and think.  If you focus on doing something, any little thing, you can get out of your head.  If you can't manage to do it for yourself, read.  Read a novel.  Be someone else.     </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My advice is to:

Travel (See this world that holds no charms for you!)

Volunteer (Do things out of the goodness of your own heart with no selfish motives.)

Make goals for yourself (See it as a challenge, play a game with yourself.  You seem pretty bright to me, or at the very least well-written... how far can that take you?  Can you trick someone into giving you a job you're not qualified for?  Can you write a novel?  Can you learn to cook a perfect macaron?)

MOVE.  (For the love of god, don't lie on the couch or sit in front of your computer all day.  Go out, go out in public.  People watch, laugh, see the sights, move your body.)

The world really is a beautiful, strange place.  We only get to live in it one time and there is a good chance that there is nothing after.  Try to reach inside and find that part of you that is curious about how things work, that can laugh at absurdities.  Try to find someone who understands you.  Try to find the things that appeal to you.  Please live.  I don't know you, not at all, but I would still be very sad if you died.    </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The only thing that I think you may need to plan for is whether ME has a great need for game wardens post-grad.  You may need to move to do what you love.  Never pay more than the minimum on your loans once you graduate, there is no point.  Save every spare dime you have for a down payment on your house and start establishing your credit.  You do that by paying for things (meaning bills) on time consistently and by opening at least one line of credit.  Once you're in the workforce, don't forget to put some money into your retirement.  It's very important to start that early. :)

Good luck, I like what you're saying here.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think the determining factor is how important your family is to you.  Some people are very family oriented and are happiest living near them, I'm one of those people.  If I were you, I would regret not moving home.  Money is one of those things that's very transient.  As they say "If you wait until you have enough money to have a baby, you will never have a baby."  A pay cut is something you'll figure out if it means being near your family.

Now if you're not that close to your family, you've got the right idea.  You need to identify if you're happy with your current situation, and if you're not, do things to make it what you want!  Remember, we can literally die at any moment, annnnny moment at all.  Think, if I were to die tomorrow, would I regret anything or would I die peacefully?  Do what you can to deal with any regrets you think you might have. :)  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hello!

A few things:

-Make sure your resume isn't from a template, you want it to be unique looking in style, professional but memorable!

-When applying, always write a cover letter for your resume.  Consider acknowledging that you don't have a lot of history, but that your drive and skills are a great fit for the company and they only need interview you in person to see how passionate you are to being part of their team.  Be earnest if that's who you are!

-Volunteer.  If you need something for a resume but don't have years of work history to illustrate your talents, volunteer in fields related to what you want to do.

Hope this helps! :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The tone of this complaint is very disturbing.  You're calling his behavior gross, insinuating that you've been confronting him, accusing him of being lazy, admitting that you've been locking things up from someone you're supposed to be taking care of... 

You're the epitome of an unreliable narrator, but if what you're saying *is* true, he's probably acting out because negative attention is better than no attention at all.  

Listen, children who come from broken homes are not always easy to deal with.  They may not come to you with open arms and open hearts and that has nothing to do with you personally.  You're clearly dealing with inadequacy issues to be this defensive towards someone who is so much younger than you.  You need to shelve it.  Be the bigger person, the adult.  Make up your mind to love him no matter what, no matter how hard it is, no matter if you're ever thanked, no matter if he looks just like your husband's ex-wife.  Just choose.  Choose the right thing.  Even if he never lets you in, being a kind, good person to someone who needs that in their life is its own reward.  I really hope you can turn this around.    </TEXT>

You do not need someone like this in your life, no one deserves to be treated like less than a human being and from what you've put here, that's just what she's doing.  

I'm not sure what exactly to say about how you can get back up, since I don't know much about your life situation (Are you graduating high school soon?  Terribly depressed?  Considering a move?

	<TEXT> First of all, you should never apologize for working towards what you've wanted the most all your life.  You're a hard working, driven individual who should be lauded.... a wonderful example for the people around you.  Don't feel guilty.  This is your life.  You have to be your own advocate.

You don't need to break it off, and I know I'm about to say one of the worst words in the relationship lexicon, but here we go: Give him the ultimatum.  Just tell him in an organized, calm manner what you basically explained here: You have been working your whole life to build a wonderful career and life for yourself away from this place that holds so many bad memories for you.  That you want the very best for yourself and your family, and that means being in a place where you can excel professionally and personally.  That you want him to be your family more than anything, but you just can't go home.  

He's probably going to break things off, maybe even for a bit, but he'll probably also come back.  And if he doesn't?  You'll know for sure that it wasn't meant to be.  He'll have done you a favor.  We always want what is best for the people we love.  If he really can't be happy unless he's home, and you can't be happy back at home, the two of you need to find happiness apart, but the truth is that a lot of times, guys just fear change.  He may well just give in when you make it clear that his refusal to move forward will cost him his relationship with you. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You either owe your friends an apology or you're being paranoid (so an apology isn't going to hurt).  I would just reach out via a text or an e-mail or even on the phone if you care a lot, a lot about that person and say something to the effect of "I wanted to apologize to you for not being as available as I've been in the past.  Your friendship is very important to me, so I want to make it very clear that while this in no way excuses my carelessness, it has everything to do with my wedding and the move and nothing to do with how I feel about you.  When all this is done, we should get together; I promise not to say one word about me.  I miss you and I'll see you soon."  Follow it up with a few random texts here and there between your apology and the wedding.  Nice things like "I saw an interview with George Clooney this morning, and it reminded me of that time, blah blah blah. You're great."  Just let them know they're on your mind. :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I met my husband at work.  Initially he was above me in the company, but I was not one of his reports.  Eventually I was promoted beyond his role.  A lot of people within the company had no idea we were married.  We made it a point to not be affectionate at work.  We talked about work related things when we needed to.  We had to go to meetings together and sometimes worked on assignments together.  It is important to report your relationship to your HR representative.  They will decide if your immediate supervisor needs to know.  Just keep it professional! :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hello ExDrK;

Almost all jobs have a 30 day grace period in which either party can terminate the working relationship without notice.  Sometimes this is included in the offer letter, sometimes it's just a disclaimer form, sometimes it is in the Non-Disclosure agreement.  I would got to your HR representative (or call the phone number for the service they use) and ask.  Just be very apologetic and professional and nice.  The truth is that most employers don't really want employees who don't want to be there, it's more respectful to just come out with it.  

Hope this helps!  </TEXT>

I can understand that she might be in more demand in a large city, but that's neither here nor there until she's licensed.  Unless you're going to tell me she's planning to move in with a specific relative there, I would question if she isn't just looking for a way out of the relationship.  If it were me, I'd actually go along any way.  You only live once, and while all change can be scary, it is almost always worth it.  You could live in a new city, explore a new field, and if the relationship goes south, meet new people.  Worst comes to worst, move back.  The truth is that you're in charge of your own destiny.  Think about what would really make you happy and go for it!  </TEXT>

A neutral character does what seems to be a good idea. She doesn't feel strongly one way or the other when it comes to good vs. evil or law vs. chaos. Most neutral characters exhibit a lack of conviction or bias rather than a commitment to neutrality. Such a character thinks of good as better than evil-after all, she would rather have good neighbors and rulers than evil ones. Still, she's not personally committed to upholding good in any abstract or universal way.  </TEXT>

On Facebook, I think it's best to only use it as a virtual photo album for your long-distance family.  I tend to try to only post supportive things and photos for people who can't be close enough to see my family in person.

LinkedIn is something I only recommend you use if you have impressive networking contacts.  It's rather pointless if you don't.

My tactics on Reddit is mostly to just be nice.  It's worked out pretty well, everyone seems a lot nicer than I thought they would be going in. :)

My own mother is one of those people who is convinced that the way she thinks is the only way to think (not just with me, but with her husband... the phrase she uses is "yes, but they're wrong!"), as a consequence, she's a very poor listener.  I can tell her things flat out and she's trying so hard to hear things she can relate to, she never remembers a thing!

	<TEXT> I think the biggest thing I'm dealing with right now is recognizing what people mean when they say "marriage is hard."  Like, I heard that and assumed it would be obvious, like you will argue and you need to make up or compromise or whatever.  I had no idea what was meant was that you're probably going to wonder all the time if the negative things are "normal."  

My husband doesn't really like to engage in conversations or discussions, he doesn't like to do things or travel, and he has a very low sex drive.  For a jag there I was thinking "Is this what a neglectful marriage is?  Should I leave?"  But I'm starting to recognize that what I make of my life is still my own responsibility.  I've abandoned waiting for his participation to do things that I want to do, I've started going out for drives and seeing things of visual interest, watching movies alone, going out to eat, volunteering, basically doing the things I seemed to think for some reason were off limits since he didn't want to do them.  It's not like he told me I can't, so only my own pre-conceived notion of what marriage is stopped me from doing these things.

I am starting to recognize what ha925 mentioned in their comment: Being able to control yourself during the downtimes.  Recognizing that there is a middle ground between all or nothing.  But I also agree with not-quite-obscure in a moderate way.  I don't think I'd ever do this again.  It seems to be a bit unnatural a lot of the time.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We never argue and here's why: My husband doesn't ever engage.  I'll say I feel x, y, and z, and this is why.  He'll stare at me.  Sometimes an hour later he'll come back and apologize for "being an asshole," or not knowing I felt that way.  That's how it works.  Very dramatic, huh?

Edit: Sorry, I ignored part II of the question.  My big points of contention are basically that he doesn't hear me.  How many times do I have to tell you that I can't stand not being able to see a damn thing in the house, but I still come home to find you swapped all the lightbulbs for colored ones that don't light anything?  Or why is it that when I'm trapped in the car with you we have to listen to Pig Destroyer three turns too loud and when I ask you to turn it down, you ignore me?  I know women get a bad rap for expecting men to read their minds, but I tell him what I want all the time, and it basically only guarantees that I won't get it.  It's exhausting.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Initially, there is no autonomy.  I know as a mother, my immediate feeling when I came home was that no one could swoop in and save me, this creature needed ME to feed her and no matter how tired or sore or scared or anything I was, it was too bad, here we are!  That was an odd feeling, I've never felt it before or since.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I recommend that you just start doing small things by yourself that give you room to breathe.  I volunteer with a hospice on the weekend, and my assignments require me to drive for an hour both ways to see my ladies.  This time by myself in the car with music I like to listen to greatly quells my wanderlust.  

A lot of the things that you've mentioned aren't really things that you can simply go out and do without there being some damage, but you know, I said to my husband (who is a major homebody and allergic to spending money) that I wanted to travel when our daughter was older.  I told him that I would love for him to come, but that if he didn't, I still needed to go.  I think a lot of young people go into marriage thinking that it means you'll do things together all the time, but the truth is that you might not ever do a thing if you wait for the other person to participate.  It's okay to do things alone! It makes you feel capable and smart and free.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I can actually count on one hand the moments I've been passive aggressive, and so they're both pretty good stories.

1. At my first job there was this girl who would never switch shifts with anyone EVER.  But she would go to the owner and have get the boss to make her the closer when she wanted extra money.  When she would steal this shift from me while I was actively working it, I would pour sweet and sour sauce on the tile floor, knowing she had to mop it and it was a bitch.

2. My old apartment had a HUGE window on one wall.  The neighbor would leave the porch light on all night, so I couldn't sleep well as it was bright, and my dogs would bark at things moving in the driveway.  I asked my husband to turn it off after an hour, but he didn't want to offend the neighbor.  One day when the light had been on all night and all of that day, I went out with a broom and very lightly tapped the lightbulb, breaking the filament in it, so it appeared to have burned out from being on all the time.  The damn thing was nine feet up, so it wasn't like they were going to change it.  Ahahaha!   </TEXT>

In 1992, my mom was married to a construction worker.  He took her with on an out of town job.  The hotel had a fabulous pool, and my mom really wanted to go swimming.  She didn't have a swimsuit.  Her husband said he would buy her one if she'd have sex with him that night.  She stipulated that she wanted tequila too if that's what needed to be done.  This is the night she conceived my youngest sister.  My sister was the consequence of a sex barter for a swimsuit.  I'm never to tell her on penalty of death.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's misplaced, but it's well-meaning.  

I actually just had a moment of clarity thinking about this.  My mom and I were talking and she casually mentioned that my sister has just decided not to go in and get her prescription renewed for her birth control.  I was beyond dismayed.  She's 23, living in a rented house with a roommate, broke, and getting married in two months.  I want to tell her that she has her whole damn life to raise babies... that she should enjoy her husband and travel and live a reckless life before committing to a baby (I have a 6 month old with my husband, so I'm projecting.).  My mother pointed out to me that my sister was much better set up than she herself was when she had her first child (me).  And in thinking about it, my mom was homeless and my father was an abusive drug addict.  No one would advise pregnancy under those circumstances... but here I am, married, a homeowner, with a career, making more than the average American, and a mother to a beautiful baby... hell, I even have rescue dogs and volunteer with a hospice....

I can handle that) but the truth is probably a lot more subtle than that.  Sometimes you feel invisible and taken for granted.  You didn't enter into a partnership in which you will do everything together... you might have married someone who will never want to take that trip or whatever... you need to move beyond what you thought your life would be like.  This has been something of a rough, and altogether different type of hard than I was imagining when I heard about it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Right, unless there is more to this scenario, it's perfectly responsible to have a life insurance plan.  I'm guessing that since you're going to grad school, you've already got a huge amount of debt.  If Canada is like the US in that regard, your parents could be saddled with that debt if, heaven forbid, anything should happen to you.  I have taken out term life insurance on my husband (in addition to the insurance I have on myself) because we have a mortgage and an infant child.

I started getting recurrent infections after using the Nuvaring, even after I switched birth control methods.  A yeast infection has an 80% chance of recurrence, so using anti-biotics is really just a risky band-aid that comes with a hefty medical bill after.  I got 00 size gel caps off of Amazon and a bottle of powdered boric acid.  If I have an infection, I insert two capsules a day (one in the morning, one at night) vaginally.  If you choose to do this, you'll want to use a panty liner.  I also do just a half gel cap after my period or after intercourse just to be safe.  I also use an oral probiotic: Acidophilus.  I get that at Wal-Greens.  I hope things get better for you!     </TEXT>

Imagine the worst possible outcome of the issue at hand.  2. Accept that it could happen.  3. Think of ways to make the best of that worst possible outcome.  

After the sheer hell that was my failure at breastfeeding followed by months of exclusive pumping that lead to three bouts of mastitis and finally Reynauld's syndrome of the nipples, I had to accept that I was going to have to give up.  This process, writing down that I would have more time with my family, get more sleep, feel less pain, focus more on my baby, be happier, etc, helped me move beyond what seemed at first a crushing failure.  This is a major example of when I used this, but as a person who struggles with anxiety about pretty much everything, you can use it to keep things in perspective.  

People with anxiety tend to be pretty capable when they know what is coming so thinking "If the meter runs out and I get a ticket, I know I can map the way to court house and that I can afford the ticket.  It will be annoying, but it is not the end of the world," can make a big difference.

This along with my decision to not go to the all-night grad party or the graduation dinner or the Sno-Ball my senior year are things I regret on a moderate level now.

	<TEXT> Lack of "whole foods" meaning food that hasn't been chemically modified or otherwise messed with.  Putting a damn window in a chicken coop doesn't make the chickens in it "free range."  There is a reason why we have so many dietary issues in the US.  30+ flavors of pop tarts doesn't help. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is what I'm talking about!!!! THAT IS IRONIC.  It's ironic!  Why, why would you assume there would be a non-smoking rule in the smoking room?  That is the opposite of what you would expect!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> How about things we have to see often:

"Just in case you thought Memorial Day was about barbecues" - Oh yeah, I totally have met that person who talks about today as national hotdog day.  That's a thing that happens! /sarcasm

"Why don't we have White History Month?" - I'm sorry, what do you think we're studying the other 11 months of the year?

"It's time we stopped apologizing for being American." - The person going door to door in Iowa demanding you drag our great nation through the mud has failed to come to my house.

"Like if you support drug testing for food stamps" - Guess what! Drug dealers don't typically accept food stamps for drugs, but you know who does take food stamps? Grocery stores. You can use the food stamps to feed the children who didn't ask to be born to the drug addicts.  You know, the ones whose food money was spent on drugs. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You know, I thought the big dissension about this song was very presumptuous.  The argument that things were "unfortunate" instead of "ironic" assumes that she didn't expect an opposite outcome.  I don't think it's a stretch to assume your wedding day would be perfect, or that on a single plane ride, you would be safe.  Am I crazy? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Just follow their sentence that ended in "sir" with a soft, non-aggressive "ma'am."  You know, correct them in a quiet sort of way.  Unless they're totally not listening, they'll apologize profusely.  I've got a bit of experience with this having done phone work. I hope this helps you. :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Respond in a nearly inaudible voice so that if they want to hear what you have to say, they have to pipe the fuck down. ;)

I'd make it a rule not to acknowledge behavior you don't appreciate.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> "Lucky Now" by Ryan Adams.  Why did he choose to not repeat the chorus after the last verse?  I love that song, but at 2 minutes and 30 odd seconds, you can't put it on repeat. :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think, and please correct me if I'm wrong, but I think you read my response as the fear being my own.  It is not.  One thing I'm learning is that people are conscious of their own memory loss and disconcerted by it.  I don't fear my own death or degenerative brain disorder.  I'm acting to try to alleviate the pressure these patients feel to remember things.  They don't really need to bother.  It's irrelevant.    </TEXT>
