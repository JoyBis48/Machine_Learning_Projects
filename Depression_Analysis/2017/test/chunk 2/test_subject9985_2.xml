	<TEXT> I suppose it's just famously used in both a wartime perspective and a peace perspective. Maybe they do mean the same thing, or maybe they're not linked at all, either way nobody I spoke to in person knew so I thought I'd ask historians. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Why did the "v" hand gesture change it's meaning from Churchill's "v for victory" to the hippie era "peace" symbol? </TITLE>
