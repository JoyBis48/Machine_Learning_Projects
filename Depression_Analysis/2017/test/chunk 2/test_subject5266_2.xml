	<TEXT> I've never looked into this game much, but can someone tell me if this is correct?

It will be a game where you buy and upgrade your space ship, you can leave your pilots seat at any time and board other ships or walk around space stations. You can use a gun and you can also land on planets (cutscene landing?)

If thats right that sounds really good, but will there be a story or is it more of an MMO experience type deal? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Writing is still important but its now become a first step for other mediums. Video content comes to mind (youtube videos like "explainers". Good speaking and imagery is important but the writing underneath is why people keep coming back. Edit: sorry, on mobile </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Definitely would love to see a Bioshock game that tackles military interventionism, particularly given recent controversies surrounding drone strikes. It can really paint you into a corner when you start creating enemies as a consequence of trying to stop your enemies. If that can be intelligently critiqued I would be pretty stoked.

Along similar lines, I feel systems like the military industrial complex or the surveilance state would also be interesting issues. Metal Gear Solid has already addressed this pretty well already, though albeit in a completely different fashion to what Bioshock could do. </TEXT>
