	<TEXT> Safe. It's a bizarre film where Julianne Moore gets "20th Century Disease". Basically it causes her to mysteriously break out in sores and have seizures due to certain chemicals and fumes like car exhaust. Nobody understands why she is having these ailments and the film is full of these sterile, long static shots that make you feel uncomfortable.  </TEXT>
