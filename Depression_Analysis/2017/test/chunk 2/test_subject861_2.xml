	<TEXT> Yeah, I should have addressed that. I know that we are supposed to have separate shoes for each, but I want to be the exception (duh)! 

I won't do heavy athletics in them. I would simply wear them while at the gym doing light lifting/running. Likewise, I wouldn't wear them casually much at all, just when I need a dark shoe to compliment a particular outfit. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Looking for a good looking athletic shoe. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-03-15 06:36:10 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Here are the qualities I am looking for in the shoe:

* I don't want to spend more than $75.
* They need to be a dark color (preferably black).  
* Must have decent/good support.
* Must strike a perfect balance, allowing me to wear them to the gym for light running/weight lifting AND out on the town with a casual day-to-day outfit. 

Ideas? I've found these so far:

Ashraf Ismail was the game director for ACIV. I highly doubt that he will be the head game director for ACV as well. Although I might be wrong. </TEXT>

I am conflicted on whether or not this works as a good navy blazer. Thoughts?

	<TEXT> You make great points. And I think the majority of the discussion regarding other people's finances all has to do with percentages. I do understand that some people can buy a mansion like I can buy a Big Mac. I do understand that. 

But just because it is difficult to tell when night ends and day begins doesn't mean that we can't know it's midnight.

I think there is an amount of balance and wisdom in the equation. I am not to judge. And I don't really want to. It was just a personal observation and I am fully aware that I might be wrong.

	<TEXT> Great article! This is where I am at:

While the two shirts are uniquely different and, to be fair,  the two MFA uses are uniquely different, I do not see $450 worth of value ever making sense to just "get *exactly* what one wants. I think that is a prideful and abundantly selfish thing. Sure, you could argue that clothing and fashion is a selfish pursuit to begin with. But I think this is excessive 99% of the time.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The Genesis account is clear that representatives of all the *kinds* of land and air animals were brought to the ark ([Genesis 6:19-20](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=gen+6%3A19-20 version=NIV)). This, for example, does not mean that there were two tigers and two lions, but that there were two feline kinds. 

If this true, the animals that survived the Flood would have had the genetic makeup to repopulate and create the current species that we have all around the world.

Animals do not have soul, but that does not mean that they are out of God's control. He is, after all, the Divine Creator. He has complete authority over all of creation, including animals. So yes, they are obeying God.

Scripture isn't clear on a localized flood although I think this is most fitting. The Flood would have covered the *known* world at the time, as the human author would have surely meant with his limited knowledge.

**TLDR:** If God is truly a miraculous God of which the Bible purports, He could surely do the miraculous to bring about a chain of events that preserve animals through and after the Flood. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Guys, honestly. I was on a cruise ship the other day and we were raided by pirates. No kidding. They swung on board screaming, "WE WANT YOUR BOOTY!" I freaked out. I had no clue what to do. So I did the only logical thing I could think of...

So when I abandoned ship and dove into the water I took a diving bell to get deep and far away from the booty snatchin' pirates. You're not going to believe what happened next...

After I punched the shark in the eye it swam away. I found another barrel, refreshed my oxygen supply, and continued to dive. Guess what happened...

I opened the treasure box that I found at the bottom of the ocean. I didn't even have to fumble with the latch, I just hit the box and it sprung open. Inside...Inside guys...there's no guessing this one so I'll just tell you...

A rolled up parchment. It read: *ACVREVEAL3414*

I have no clue what it means, just thought I should share. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ender's Game is a fantastic book. It shows the brilliant potential of children and takes you into the mind of a genius. The cast of characters are dynamic and compelling. The story is riveting and well-rounded, easily accessible for many ages, backgrounds, and enjoyments. 

If you decide to continue the series, stay with the Ender's Saga (Speaker for the Dead) if you enjoy the intellectual/philosophical nature of Ender's Game. Move to the Bean Saga (Ender's Shadow) if you enjoyed the action sequences the most in Ender's Game. </TEXT>
