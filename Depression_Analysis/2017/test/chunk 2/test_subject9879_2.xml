	<TEXT> One of my friends had this exact same track (BS in Chemistry, then worked at L'Oreal, and came to materials science). My advice - you have to pay. 
As in get an unfunded masters at a decent school (top 20 will still be difficult to get into), work on research there. If your MS GPA is much better (shoot for 3.5+) - you are all set.
The con - the whole thing will not be cheap, because the dirty secret in STEM fields is that MS programs are university cash cows - so going unfunded for two years is going to cost you in the ballpark of $100,000.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not wrong - but there is something about academia that allows toxic behaviors to fester much longer than any half-decent HR department would tolerate. Actually, HR supervision in academia almost never happens. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Observation from my own university: The grad student a year ahead of me in my school - are uber competitive, and many are outright toxic to work with. On the other hand, PhD students who joined with me are super nice, and we hang out after hours all the time. Same for the year junior to me. Even though one of our Assistant Professors who did his PhD from this school remarks that his cohort was much friendlier than any of ours. By the way, from this admittedly very small sample space i observed that competitiveness has no correlation with productivity. 
Two final remarks - collaboration is a must today in my field. If you want to publish in a top-tier journal you must collaborate. And secondly, being an international student from Asia myself - I find that Asian students are much more competitive, and less collaborative and contribute to the department atmosphere overall in a negative rather than a positive fashion. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Much, much higher expectations. Failure will be much less tolerated, as people would expect you to be more productive from day 1 - (not for students who enter PhD directly from a BS - those guys catch an yearlong break).
Personally, after my MS and in a full time PhD I was surprised how sick and tired I had become of the whole classes-homework-exams grind. I almost had to pay for my negligence in that aspect. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Every department has its share of known assholes. And they will often be tolerated if they bring boatloads of cash.
Honestly though in my experience, untenured faculty are much worse. There are several horror stories in my department, but they are for another time, another place. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No, in hindsight that guy had severe anger management issues. As everyone knows grad school can often be stressful, and I have seen that my criticisms are much more harsh when I am more tired or stressed out. But it is not a valid excuse, and I am trying to work on it . </TEXT>

	<TITLE> How not to be a jerk? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Years before when I was a junior FOB grad student at my previous university for my M.S. I worked with a terrible bully. It was an year which almost destroyed my confidence. Now at my current university, I am now a senior, and actually productive grad student. And I find myself being a jerk often to my junior students. Granted they are making mistakes. But on reflection, those mistakes are made by everyone early on, and were even made by me. 
Fellow subredditors, have you ever faced this? And how did you change? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was on probation - got a C and had my GPA drop down to 2.84 but it is OK now - it is 3.55. In my experience, even a below 3 did not matter much. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 1) How highly advisor dependent the whole thing is. Universities matter for resources, but your grad school experience will be massively influenced with the relationship you have with your advisor. Corollary: How terribly unstructured things are.

2) The biggest challenge IMO is to keep yourself motivated when things don't work out, which they often don't. Fear honestly drives me more often.

3) I get by really poorly financially, and do have some debt now.

4) I am still poor in structuring time - even though because I had been really productive the last few months I see light at the end of the tunnel - I will get by working 10 hours a day a few months from now on.

5) In the first year, despite what everyone says do not focus too much on research. Keep that year aside for degree requirements. It will be much less stressful later on that way.

6) OK. I have some very close friends, and I make it a point to attend parties and bars at least once every two weeks to keep myself sane. </TEXT>
