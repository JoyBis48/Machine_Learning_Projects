Any bill passed by the House and Senate that Democrats disapprove of will be vetoed by Obama and nothing will change that because the GOP do not have 2/3 majorities in both houses, or even one house.

	<TEXT> Yes, in this case. Here the Circuit Court of Appeals ruled the ban unconstitutional, and the Supreme Court chose not to take the case.

Because if it passed, it would make absolutely no difference. Each state answers to the Supreme Court and since they ruled abortion is legal, it is for every state unless a US Constitutional amendment bans it or the Court reverses itself. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Napalmenator is. I directly asked him if he would subject his child to a situation in which he believed his child was being physically or sexually abused if the court ordered him to do so and he answered he would, by saying he would not violate a custody agreement.

I have made my point clear on what I would do and I stand by it: contact the police immediately and not let her son go over there in the meantime. I don't think any rationale parent in the world would subject their child to physical or sexual abuse just because of a custody agreement.

To pose the same question to you: Would you send your child into an environment you suspect they are being physically or sexually abused in, if there was a court that ordered you to do so? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Someone help me here cause I know there's a few hidden things near the end.

How did Amy get pregnant? The sperm bank? When did she get pregnant?

What were Affleck and the sister planning at the end? Not to kill her, but... Also, what was with the several instances of twincest insinuations? Was there actually something going on? Was that why the sister got THAT mad when she found him banging slutbag when she already hated the wife and was jealousy the reason she hated the wife? Did they ever mention why she hated the wife?

Why did he feel so trapped with her at the end? Why not just leave? Why not try to record her? She was obviously getting careless when she said she killed for him and he was fully clothed and could have been wearing a wire.

What was the significance of the dementia dad? There must have been something. Why did Affleck only visit him once in a year he had been in the old people home?

What was the significance of the parents borrowing from her trust?

And last, how in the world did Amy find out that Affleck was banging this girl in the fathers house, in the woodshed, etc.? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ok, so purely from a financial standpoint, this is stupid. HOWEVER, it depends how much this is worth it to you intrinsically.

From a loans standpoint, you're decent. Your $30K in loans at 0% interest is about equal to $21.5K in loans if they were at 7% interest, a pretty standard rate, for the standard 10 year repayment period.

So if I were you, I'd figure out if your total loans after studying abroad, equal to $30K at 0% and $20K at 7%, are going to be in excess of 10% of your salary after graduating and getting a job. I calculated that you'd need to pay about $5700 a year in loans to pay them all back in 10 years, meaning if your expected salary upon graduation is above $57,000 then go for it, and if not don't. </TEXT>

HOWEVER, I believe that everyone should be given due process. What this does not mean is that their due process must come from the govt directly. But a small hearing with impartial judges deciding AP's fate after hearing all of the evidence available? Yea, I think they'd be fine suspending him after that. Do you agree? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm by no means an expert in the subject but I'll try to answer. The number of deaths from 9/11 is massively higher than the vast majority of terrorist attacks. Just to give you a statistic, in 50% of all suicide terrorist attacks, the only person that dies is the suicide terrorist themselves. Not to mention that 9/11 was the mark of an absolute explosion in suicide terrorism across the world. If you were to look at a chart, you would see the number of deaths resulting from suicide attacks drastically increases in the following years. It's also just a marker that life as we knew it was over. Between the PATRIOT Act, increased airport security, and the creation of a new Dept of Homeland Security it just changed so much about our way of life. </TEXT>

I didn't do CAP, but I did a year at UTSA and it was the easiest thing in the world. I made A's in all 10 classes including Fall and Spring then transferred to UT and actually just graduated (finished all my classes in July). And UT isn't exceptionally hard either. I can count on one hand the number of classes I didn't make A's in while there. Granted, I studied my ass off my entire time at both UTSA and UT. I say all this not to brag, and really hope it doesn't come off that way, but just to let you know it's not that bad to spend a year somewhere else and it's totally do-able. Good luck and let me know if you have any questions. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I see that and agree. But there's plenty in here that is just consensual stuff going on, whereas this is non-consensual to their SO's. The cheaters should not be encouraged, in my opinion. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There are no legitimate reasons, therefore it makes the person a shitty person no matter what.

What you're saying is tantamount to someone admitting to killing their 5 year old child in a gleeful manner (which is the attitude this guy and girl gave off bragging of their cheating) and you saying you'll "wait to hear all the facts." A reasonable person can conclude that its not necessary to hear much more, and if there was a justification, the people would have said it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Give me a legitimate reason on why someone cannot/won't leave their SO.

What else would they do? LEAVE THEIR SO. That is the alternative to cheating.

I am commenting on what a reasonable person could take from the post, that they are having sex with other people, without the permission of their SO. It seems a reasonable person would take those to be the substantial facts here.

	<TEXT> I never said the case was clear. I merely said it was not alleged, it was a matter of fact. The United States court system allows for an allegation to become fact upon conviction by a jury of your peers. That is an indisputable fact.

Edit: Just for fun, I'll comment along with you. You didn't give context and I haven't read the interview, but I'll assume the quotations are from Tyson.

Point 1: Tyson says he did less time b/c the judge did not believe he committed the crime. This is where I introduce the concept that correlation=/=causation. Just b/c he was given less time than others does not equate to the fact that the judge believed he was not guilty. There were several other mitigating circumstances, such as the fact that some of the evidence was not as strong, or the fact that he had no prior felonies. Further, a Court of Appeals certified that the evidence was strong enough that he should not even be granted a retrial. If he really thought people believed he did not commit the crime, then why didn't the Court of Appeals vacate his conviction or at the very least give him a new trial?

Point 2: Tyson says that just b/c she falsely claimed she was raped once, she should never have put herself in that position. What position? The position of having entering a hotel room? The position of hanging out with someone you don't know alone? Any of these contentions are absolutely ridiculous and have no bearing on proof of his guilt or innocence and the very fact that he made these contentions is insulting to all rape victims. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey just a note, but it's not an "alleged" rape. He was convicted by a jury of his peers. He is for all intents and purposes guilty of rape and therefore it is treated as a matter of fact, not allegation.

Edit: LOL to all the haters. Feel free to downvote me. It's a matter of fact that upon conviction by a jury of your peers, an allegation is seen by fact for all intents and purposes. If you wanna hate on me for stating a something that is unilaterally true, at least have the decency to comment with a reason.

Edit 2: Goddamn you guys are just a bunch of whiners about this. I point out one factually relevant point about a post and you guys fly off your hinges. I always assumed my fellow /r/MMA-ers were a cool bunch of folks, but I have been proven otherwise. Have fun debating others about how facts don't apply to you bunch. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Contact the police in the meantime and have record of ownership (vet records, if your dog is chipped, adoption records, etc.). You will get your dog back immediately.

In the meantime the guy can sue you for $1000, which I would guess you MIGHT be obligated to pay, but not anything above that as any judge will find that $1000 is a reasonable reward.

If you don't know where the guy lives who has your dog, I would set up a fake meeting, telling him you have the $1500 then call the police once he shows up unwilling to give you the dog, and follow him if he leaves the meeting spot while maintaining contact with police. </TEXT>

Here's a hypo:
Man in car crash. Man loses consciousness and suffers severe lacerations. Emergency medical workers show up and treat the lacerations. Man regains consciousness. Man refuses ambulance ride after stabilized and walks home.

Do you think the man would not be required by a court to pay for his treatment?

	<TEXT> No judge will count the cost of wood flooring under a carpet and padding as ruined by cat pee. If I were you I would tell her she has no evidence of ruining the wood and it is unreasonable for her to count it in your damages.

In most cases, you are required to give 30 days notice, even after a lease runs out. You will automatically revert to a month to month tenant with no lease and this is one of the requirements. You're saying you gave her 26 days notice? I am not a lawyer, and you should consult one for an answer, but I would think you would only have to reimburse those four days so for example if your rent was $500 then you would have to reimburse 500*(4/30)= $66.67

I would consult a lawyer for advice on these issues if I were you but ultimately take her to small claims court without a lawyer. In many states you can sue for 2-3 times the money that is rightfully yours. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So the carpet wasn't new when you moved in. She is entitled to charge you proportionally for the life expectancy of the carpet for the damage you did. Say life expectancy was 10 years and carpet cost $500. If it was 5 years old, and the cat pee ruined it then you owe $250.

If I were you, I would let her know that you know you are aware that you only owe for the life expectancy you prematurely ended. You ask her to produce a receipt or official record of when the carpet was purchased, what the cost was, and what the life expectancy was. If she refuses and continues to pursue further you take her to small claims court. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  I'm not a lawyer, but I am in law school and studied several cases taught by law school professors in undergrad. And something I've learned is that if a reasonable person can imply something then it has at least some consideration. Here, the landlord could reasonably conclude that she had leased the property for a minimum of one year. That is why I came to my conclusion. </TEXT>

This is generally illegal. I do not specifically know the laws of your state, but in general you can only sue for ACTUAL damages. If she is not losing any money, she will not win any damages.

	<TEXT> If she has emails of you implying you know your lease is for a year, then you should be prepared to lose in court. I am not giving you binding legal advice, but absent of any other major factors, this seems like a 50/50 case.

Have you looked into subleasing? You should be able to find someone to sublease your place for a couple months and usually around the same rent you are paying as that is most likely near the market rate. Also, be sure to check your lease on the legalities of it. But even if it is against your lease, your landlord may be willing to make an exception (GET IT IN WRITING IF SHE DOES) because she most likely wants to avoid a big legal headache as much as you do. </TEXT>

To expand on my main post, I feel that if we condone this behavior in any way, i.e. calling it just for one party, then that is going to encourage others in similar situations, resulting in a VERY slippery slope. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The fact of the matter is, in this case yes the guilt was kind of clear, and many will argue the punishment fit. But if you allow vigilante justice, you screw the whole system.

What about a guy that's "pretty sure" someone else killed his dog? Can he go destroy that guy's car? What about a case like this, but the driver were not drunk, and merely hit a pothole causing the car to swerve and kill these two kids? Would he deserve to die in that case?

At the end of the day, we as a society have agreed that anyone, guilty or innocent, deserve their day in court before they are punished. The driver in this case was deprived of that. For me, that is injustice. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Classic case of jury nullification. I read another article with more/different details.

Basically the guy was pushing his car (ran out of gas) with his two sons in what was basically the middle of nowhere, but still near this guy's house. Drunk driver plows into sons and kills them. Then drunk driver is shot to death almost immediately. They are 100 yards from guy who just had his son's died house. The ammunition the drunk driver was shot with matches ammunition that was found in guy's house.

Defense's argument was someone else randomly came and shot the drunk driver. Small town jury felt sorry for the man and acquitted in face of obvious beyond a reasonable doubt evidence. Due to double jeopardy the man will never be found guilty. Justice? You decide.  </TEXT>
