	<TEXT> This is why I question Blizzard's explanation of poor matchmaking being due to a small player base. Everyone I know that wants to play, can play. The game has pretty much been semi-launched for a while now, and I don't see much changing with launch.

I hope I'm wrong. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  They absolutely are not "against" bc.

Not sure about that. They frequently promote "abstinence only" policies.

 They're against public funding for it.

That's true enough, though why it's preferable to pay significantly more for the costs of unwanted pregnancies, rather than paying much less to prevent them, is beyond me.

I'm pretty liberal, though, so paying $X for social policies to prevent $6X in long-term costs is right up my alley. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think Jaina is the hero that has the most variability. I feel I'm making a choice at every level, which is fantastic. For most heroes, I have a set build that doesn't change, or if it's only one or two talents that might change situationally. Some heroes I have two builds that are like that.

Jaina is the only one that I play where everything is in flux at almost every level, and I love that about her. Almost all of her talents feel viable and useful, and very few of them stand out as the "correct" choice for every situation. </TEXT>

* A Starcraft non-combat support unit like an overlord, raven, arbiter, etc., that has no actual combat abilities, just provides information, buffs, and infrastructure.

And if your team does show up, you'll really do some significant damage. A fort at least. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not sure I agree. A well-used terror can easily get 2-3 forts. That's massive. If the other team is ignoring my terror and it results in a 4v5, I think it's on my team to simply play safely while I absolutely wreck the opposing team.

The only times that I think it's all that appropriate to fight as the terror are:

1. If you're near enough to a kill/fight that you can secure it without sinking too much time into it.
2. If you're in desperate need of defense.

Perhaps I'm wrong, but in my experience, you want the terror pushing, especially if the other team is letting you do it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Zagara is incredibly strong. She dishes out insane amounts of damage from far away and has the ability to zone enemies out very effectively. She almost always dominates her lane, can hold her own in many 1v1 situations (though it's usually a game of chicken), and she's awesome to have in a team fight, especially, though not exclusively, thanks to the incredible power of maw.

Her only serious weakness is her lack of an escape before 20, and you can compensate for that with creep by keeping your route to safety covered and using it to see threats early enough to run.

TL;DR - Zagara is always awesome, just be prepared and informed well enough to run in time, while murdering anything and everything that you don't like (for the swarm, of course). </TEXT>

Maybe, but not necessarily. Google has recently adopted the stance that a human driver is not a reliable backup for an automated car. A person trying to correct the car's decision making would likely cause more issues than they would prevent.

Of course, we're in very uncharted territory, so we'll see if that pans out or not. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sure, here are several key points.

1. Prohibition doesn't work. People that want pot can get pot, and all we're doing is denying ourselves the opportunity to tax and regulate it. It's the exact same thing that happened during alcohol prohibition. In fact, many kids choose pot over beer because it's easier to get.
2. We're taking money and jobs out of the legitimate economy, and giving it directly to gangs, drug dealers, and ultra violent cartels, who, along with marijuana, deal in harder drugs, weapons, and slaves (and who knows what else). To say nothing of the massive tax revenue, and the fact that we're packing for-profit prisons
3. Marijuana is very likely a gateway drug, not because people that use it are inspired on to harder drugs, but because anyone that wants pot has to know a drug dealer. CVS is not going to push meth while it's selling you pot, but your normal weed hook
4. Weed is, by virtually all accounts, harmless. In a free society, you don't need a reason to make something legal, you need one to make it illegal.
5. We're packing for-profit prisons and destroying the lives of many law-abiding citizens. We lock them up, ruining their jobs/careers, and when we do release them, they're now in a harder situation and with many more criminal contacts.
6. We're arbitrarily denying people medicine and treatments that could really help them. Medical marijuana is often the only thing that can relieve pain and siezures for many people, and is now even being shown to be an effective treatment to some types of cancer. People are suffering, and in some cases dying, all in the name of (not really) inhibiting the use of recreational substance far less harmful (if harmful at all) than alcohol.
7. The only people who have something to lose by legalization are drug dealers, cartels, for-profit prisons (and the industry built around the monetization of incarceration), and beer companies. The rest of society, even non-smokers (like myself, don't plan on ever even trying it) will benefit almost immeasurably.

Oh, you said arguments *against* legalization! Yeah, I've got nothing there... </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  I still don't see what the benefits are of legalizing it other than some hypothetical talk about how much money it'll bring in from taxes.

It's far from hypothetical. Look how much Colorado has already brought in.

I don't want people getting stoned and then possibly getting behind the wheel or doing something that ends up hurting or killing someone else.

Here's the core thing to focus on: prohibition isn't prevent people from using pot. They already are. Tons and tons of them. Many kids choose weed over beer because it's a lot easier to get. The only things we're doing by making it illegal is giving up the opportunity to regulate it, and funding criminal enterprises. 

If they go making it legal for cancer patients as a pain management drug, do they really believe those patients are going to be the only ones using it?

This is a particularly disturbing comment. If you'd let people suffer in an attempt to keep other people from using marijuana recreationally, I think you really need to re-examine your priorities.

Sure it might slow down the black market for pot

When is legal all across the country, there will be no black market. If you want proof, try and find a liquor bootlegger.

the bigger problem is what pot does to you when you smoke it.

Alcohol is far more harmful than pot. Do you support a return to alcohol prohibition as well?

TL;DR - Prohibition doesn't keep people from using marijuana, and it does far more damage than it prevents (if it prevents any at all). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The only thing I disagree with is that Baneling Range isn't good. I find it very useful. When you get good enough with it, you can put it to some really great effects, such as cutting enemies off from a route of escape, splitting them up, dissuading a chase you want to avoid, disrupting objectives, adding presence to a fight from afar, etc.

I'm not saying that it's better than the regeneration, but it's definitely a worthwhile talent, once you've gotten good with it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Really clever. Nicely done.

I build a little differently, though:

4: Amplified Healing if we have a healer, if not deadly strike if their team is especially squishy, Swift Reflexes otherwise. SR is nice, but Chen is unbelievably tanky as is, and chances are SR is going to proc during a shield.

13: Enough To Share - most enemies are smart enough to not attack Chen, so extending your shield to allies while you drink is quite valuable in a team fight.

16: Bolder Flavor - You can survive just about anything with this.

20: Hardened Shield - Makes you truly unkillable. I really just take this, though, because the other options aren't fantastic. Bolt of the Storm is redundant with Flying Kick, and the barrel is plenty strong as is. Kind of a lackluster level 20 for Chen. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This deck was great a couple of weeks ago, but now I can't win with it to save my life. It's just far too slow. Unless I draw early innervates and wild growths (which I mulligan for aggressively), by the time I have enough mana to play anything of value I'm instead spending my turn on healbots to prevent my inevitable demise. Even with the early mana cards, face hunters burn me down too quickly, and I often don't have a way to play around mirror entity. As mages and hunters make up 90% of play right now, those are two very big problems.

I main Tyrael, and I build him very tanky, but I disagree with this. I think he does a better job initiating and bullying than soaking damage. He's not squishy by any means, but I would consider him an off-tank, not a full tank.

I think that would change if he had a worthwhile trait that contributed to his survivability, though. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Agreed. His trait is practically non-existent. It does nothing while he's alive, and hardly anything when he dies as it's both easily avoided, it's almost never enough damage to get a kill, and even if you do get a kill, your team is now missing a tank.

The big problem with death traits is that they're factored into a hero's balance, meaning not only does Tyrael's trait do nothing to keep him alive, it actually makes him more likely to die, as the rest of his kit pays some price for his death explosion.

It'd be much better if he had something that helped *avoid* his death, rather than making his death slightly inconvenient for the enemy team.

Here's my idea:

 **Archangel's Watch**
 
 Every time a hero deals damage to Tyrael, that hero gains a stack of guilt which decreases damage done to Tyrael by 0.5% per stack. Upon reaching a maximum of 10 stacks, the hero is deemed guilty and one of Tyrael's wings reaches out and grasps the hero. Guilty heroes are always revealed and have an additional 5% of the damage they deal to Tyrael reflected back at them.
 
 If a hero leaves Tyrael's area of influence, all of that hero's guilt is forgiven, and if Tyrael or any of his enemy heroes dies, all enemy guilt is forgiven.

This gives Tyrael some additional survivability (after a while he's taking up to 10% less damage from heroes focusing him), and it's very thematic. You shall pay for your sins, but an enemy's sacrifice can absolve you of your guilt. And Tyrael does use his wings when he fights, because he's a bad ass. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Agreed. I've come back from some pretty staggering deficits, as well as been on the other end of that stick. The fact that you can be way down, but win a crucial team fight that positions you for the win means that every single fight matters.

One of my favorite things about this game is that it's not over until it's truly over. Players that understand this will have an edge over those that don't, and that's a good thing. </TEXT>

I know that they mentioned having problems with the chipset, but if fast updates where part of the phones promotion, and it's been this long and we still don't have the latest update, then it's going to make me not want to do business with that company in the future.

This is the big dissuading factor for me, as well. It took 2 months to get 4.4.4, too, and we never even got 4.4.3. </TEXT>

More importantly, though, was during team fights, I was really wishing I had something that was useful in a team fight...

	<TEXT> Great site. Just need something to deal with the trolls. Auto-hide functionality based on downvotes is probably ideal, but in the meantime you might want to delete some of the more egregious ones.

Also the ability to un-vote would be nice. So clicking downvote twice would bring you back to having not-voted, like reddit does.
