	<TITLE> How to improve your brain </TITLE>

	<TEXT> My attempt is to try low stimulation activities, these include staring at a wall and doing nothing, walking while doing nothing or reading a book like nietzsche, our lives are full of overly stimulating activities like music, movies, games, porn the idea is to challenge the brain to live with normal to low stimulation, the brain should get "hungry" for stimulation and also your creative side will wake up even more. The mechanics for one activity goes:

Walk

 thought enters head

time is precious, is this thought even worth thinking about, this thought is probably a rationalization or weakness is it?

 next thought comes in "an urge to play a game", is there a good reason to play that game? no

 another thought "is this worth precious human seconds?" probably not

eventually the boredom will fuel the brain for neuroplasticity and creativity for self improvement

thoughts guys? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> An idea nietzsche put out there that clears this up. Many complex systems such as addiction as well as life can not be summed up into steps or rules we need to think for ourselves and deal with our problems as each situation is unique. This is why he despised the stoics while they said "just be perseverant" you can't sum up life to that one statement but I agree with everything else. </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2013-11-22 02:06:02 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> 
You're now chatting with a random stranger. Say hi!

You both like philosophy.

You: Hello.

Stranger: hi

Stranger: ive noticed people with this philosophy tag type "hello" instead of hi

Stranger: and put a period after it

Stranger: aswell

You: Read Nietzsche?

Stranger: yes i know some

You: Such as?

Stranger: the will to power

You: Yeah i'm interested in ubermench

You: I wake up i try to improve my life, i still scratch my hair and skin, i still pop my joints, i still can't read a 

book and focus, i still get scared and anxious and confused, i still, fap and watch porn, i still eat junk, i still 

distract myself rather than think difficult thoughts, i am trying to re-wire these things but it looks like the 

downward spiral isn't changing course thus making it even harder to quit in the future neuroscience :(

Stranger: ok.

You: any thoughts?

Stranger: what does it mean to "improve your life"

Stranger: ?

You: move beyond your illusion

Stranger: theres your ego

You: self overcome

Stranger: you asked for my thoughts

You: well honestly are you pulling some zen buddism now?

Stranger: no

Stranger: i asked a simple question

Stranger: i dont see the relation

You: my answer is the paragraph above

Stranger: are you telling me you can not respond logically to a challenge?

You: you can deduce what it means to improve

Stranger: no i wont

Stranger: because you cant

Stranger: i have no interest

Stranger: because you are now below me

Stranger: and you have proven it

You: how so...

You: now you are being an elitist

Stranger: you want to express your bullshit delusional ideas but cant defend them with a logic structure

Stranger: no im not an elitist

Stranger: im sorry your ego is hurt

Stranger: it wasnt a complex question that went off on a tangent

Stranger: it was rather simple and challenged the base.

Stranger: the base should be strong

You: Self improvement is have control over one's self

Stranger: no it isnt

Stranger: that is your subjective interpretation of it

You: Training yourself to have conscious control when second nature insists otherwise

Stranger: so you are implying there is duality

You: No

Stranger: how can you not be in "conscious control"

Stranger: how could you know consciousness beyond your human consciousness

You: Just conflicting actions with desires

Stranger: are you implying that actions arent a product of desires/

Stranger: that duality exists between them

You: No

You: ...

Stranger: so then back it up

Stranger: use logic.

You: I'm using reasoning

You: and critical thinking

Stranger: no you arent.

Stranger: you arent challenging my points

You: Your points are not pertinent

Stranger: they are absolutely related

Stranger: everything ive been saying is a response to you

You: hmm

You: I did respond though

Stranger: i didnt say you didnt

You: I don't need to back up my "no"

Stranger: but you are by saying you dont need to back it up

Stranger: fool

Stranger: basic logic failure

Stranger: again.

Stranger: and again.

Stranger: my points remain uncontested

Stranger: you go off on more tangents now

You: No, you made claims without backing them up.

You: The burden of proof is on you.

Stranger: as in where

Stranger: bring it up

Stranger: where i did

Stranger: burden of proof is on me

Stranger: thats a baseless claim in itself

Stranger: rather than being your opinion

Stranger: but yea where did i make a claim without backing it up

You: You want your points contested.

You: Show me a point.

Stranger: we are having a discussion

Stranger: so you want to switch the topic now..

You: They are questions. In which I replied No.

Stranger: no you went off on a tangent

Stranger: i asked you to back up claims

Stranger: your base was "no"

Stranger: should i leave then?

Stranger: since you cant hold a conversation

You: What claim should I back up

You: You asked me if I was implying anything

You: and I said NO

Stranger: i did more than ask questions

Stranger: i think i added statements as well

Stranger: let me scroll

Stranger: "Self improvement is have control over one's self"

Stranger: that doesnt comply with the linear logic structure of language

Stranger: so back it up

Stranger: x=y

Stranger: is what you said

You: To achieve self improvement self control over one's self is a necessary skill.

Stranger: you just changed the point you made

You: i did

Stranger: so you couldnt back it up

Stranger: i assume

You: Not the first one

You: I re stated it

Stranger: sure i will challenge this one too

Stranger: saying something is "necessary" isnt true outside of your personal truths. "necessity" is an abstract 
subjective idea

You: Sure

You: It is of high importance subjectively

You: Saying that it is not is nihilism.

Stranger: "importance" is also a subjective abstract idea

Stranger: what?

Stranger: nihilism is a paradox...

Stranger: saying life is pointless is a point in itself

Stranger: as where believing life is meaningless is a given meaning in itself

Stranger: correct?

You: No

You: "as where believing life is meaningless is a given meaning in itself"

You: how is that a given meaning in itself?

Stranger: because it follows logic. "saying life is pointless is a point in itself"

Stranger: see the irony?

Stranger: meaning is an abstract subjective idea aswell. by saying it is meaningless

Stranger: you still use meaning

You: There is a regress there. Life is meaningless -- Created meaning --- Meaning that was created becomes 
meaningless. Followed by a halt in changing states as the threshold is exceeded.

Stranger: it is a paradox

Stranger: and meaning that was created becomes meaningless is meaning

Stranger: and it goes on and on

You: Intuitively ergo Life is meaningless.

Stranger: it doesnt mean it isnt it just means it also is meaning

Stranger: its

Stranger: a

Stranger: paradox

You: how old are you?

Stranger: why do you ask the question at this point in the conversation

Stranger: i hope this wont turn to an ad hominem

Stranger: but i mean you are going off on a tangent

You: Being overly analytical can be seen as a form of escapism, using what valuable time you have to escape 
solving real life solutions.

You: You limit your intuition to logic.

Stranger: believing that anyone can be "overly analytical" is a belief in itself

Stranger: so is everything you said

Stranger: there is a loophole in logic

Stranger: and so i challenge language

Stranger: but you hold absolutes with logic

Stranger: believing there is something to escape from is abelief aswell

You: Intuitively you seem trapped here. What's the reason for challenging the fabric here?

Stranger: i would say this pattern is more confrontational

Stranger: I seem trapped, yet you are the one going off on tangents and my last related point was uncontested 
again

You: so?

Stranger: you dont reach a dead end with this logic structure

Stranger: rather a circle

Stranger: that continues

Stranger: so you can argue forever

Stranger: and that is more confrontational than escapist

You: Living lifeoverly analytical

Stranger: i dont even agree with what i type but you dont have the intellect to point out my contradiction of self
You: As a function of time

Stranger: going off on a tangent again

Stranger: more ad hominems

You: How is it an AH?

Stranger: you just stated an opinion again while i maintaing objectivity in the logic structure of language

Stranger: because it is an opinion by logics standards

Stranger: and you are using that logic structure to communicate

You: ...

Stranger: we can take it more slowly for you.

Stranger: saying "living life is better than being overly analytical"

Stranger: is that an opinion?

Stranger: are the reasons for that belief based on opinions?

Stranger: is it subjective?

Stranger: answer those

Stranger: yes or no questions

You: It's based on intuition that is not limited by the constraints you keep on building.

Stranger: you are implying that i understand what you are trying to say

Stranger: thats an assumption in itself

Stranger: a belief.

Stranger: right?

You: Objectively and evolutionarily the individual is programmed to survive and reproduce, self improvement is 
intuitively superior to over analysis which is escapism in nature.

Stranger: no. that itself is a belief

Stranger: you are holding things to be absolute

Stranger: can you not see that what you are saying is subjective?

You: Your beliefs that beliefs are to be negated is an assumption in itself

Stranger: who said they are to be negated

You: now you are being paradoxical

You: you refute "beliefs"

Stranger: no

You: you haven't backed up why those are "absolutes"


Stranger: i just point out they are beliefs

Stranger: i just said there arent absolutes

Stranger: ..

You: "you are holding things to be absolute"

Stranger: o

Stranger: why do you hold them to be absolute

Stranger: was the question

Stranger: ok

You: I don't what makes you think I do?

Stranger: because by making a statement, you hold it to be definitive by its nature

Stranger: by the logic structure that you participate in called language

Stranger: every statement is a paradox

Stranger: even saying every statement is a paradox is a paradox

Stranger: meaning, if i say nothing is absolute. i am holding "nothing is absolute" as absolute

Stranger: so it doesnt reach a dead end with this logic structure

Stranger: it just loops

You: ok

You: What is the over arching concept here

Stranger: ok

Stranger: how could i communicate it with language.

Stranger: after what i just said

You: Intuition

Stranger: intuition is a product of this logic

You: How?

Stranger: because it is an idea that can be formulated into words

Stranger: its paradoxical

You: how is it a posteriori?

Stranger: im going to use an idea that can be formulated into words to express an idea that cant be formulated 

into words

Stranger: thats what i cant do

Stranger: but i can

Stranger: because i just said it

Stranger: thats why its paradoxical

Stranger: agree? disagree?

Stranger: "thoughts"

You: indifeference

You: indifference

Stranger: if you were indifferent then you wouldnt need to say you were indifferent

Stranger: see how it loops?

You: I'm indifferent about your statement I care about stating it though.

Stranger: right



Stranger: so you arent indifferent

You: I'm indifferent about your statement I care about stating it 

though.



Stranger: after all that you still cant use the intellect



You: What?



Stranger: you defending what you initially said is just as paradoxical



Stranger: and you cant see that


Stranger: or dont want too

Stranger: w/e

You: You are the one that can't use intellect.

Stranger has disconnected.

	<TEXT> "I, test_subject2183, accept the challenge of being accountable for the next 90 days to this group of Fapstronauts. I will make it the full 90 days without viewing pornographic materials, faping, edging, or having any form of sexual intercourse with my wife. I am committing to this because I love my wife more than anyone in the world, and I MUST change for her! When I prove to myself that I can endure this 90 day struggle, I will have the ability to stand strong for the rest of my life."
(You can set your own rules for these next 90 days, and briefly summarize why YOU need to change.)
We will kick off this 90 Day Group Accountability on Sunday, November 24th. Anyone who would like to jump on board with us must have this post submitted no later than Saturday the 23rd, so forward this link to all of your friends, and get the word out! I will link "Day one's" thread </TEXT>

Exercise.
Save money.
Plan for your future. Invest in it.
Wrap your tool.
Tell everyone how you feel about them because in your future they will all be dead.
Relax.
Be positive. Choose to be happy.
Surround yourself with positive, caring people that are better than you.
Practice forgiveness and understanding.
Set goals and put your entire being towards them, whatever they may be.
Give everything you do in life 100%, regardless of how you feel about it. Success is a choice you make every day; it is not dependent upon results.
You're not always right. Always assume you could be wrong. If you are, forgive yourself and move on. Don't dwell. Be thankful to those who corrected you. Ego and pride are roadblocks, surpass them.
Your entire life is defined more by what you give to others than what you have or receive, whether you want to admit it or not. Every day practice a habit of giving, even if it's something small like a compliment. You always have something to offer others, even if you don't have time or money.
Remember that you, just like everyone else, have the power to change the world profoundly. You matter. You only have one life. Make it count. </TEXT>
