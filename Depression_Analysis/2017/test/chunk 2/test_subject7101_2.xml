	<TEXT> it was boring and a sign of how the rest of the year will be

some teams are struggling to even finish a race.. Rosberg doesn't have what it takes to challenge Hamilton, the Ferrari's have improved but not enough to pose a threat to the Mercedes and we have yet to see a good vettel kimi battle because something always fucks it

williams not good enough to keep up with the ferrari so we can expect the same results each race 1.hamilton 2 rosberg 3 vettel 4 kimi 5-6 bottas/massa

1.6 million in previous events would of got into the top 100 no problems seems now you got to get over 4-6 million to place well </TEXT>

	<TEXT> they are far too greedy for that they would much rather release several 200 clam items every event so people have to buy several $100 clam options to have everything

personally i wouldn't spend $100 on a mobile app even if it gave unlimited clams i play this game for 1-2 minutes maybe 2-3 times a day.. not the same as spending $100 on a PC/console game that will give me 100's of hours of immersive gameplay  </TEXT>

king butt, comic con which went for 40 days then Halloween and now american dad to me that's far too many events in a short period of time

	<TEXT> this only seems to happen to me on my best runs and ones i use ISO-8 to continue on

i just scored 2.6 million on the daily run and game decides not to register it i even used 6 ISO during the game

game is more than happy to take the ISO and not register the score

seriously getting over the glitches this fucking game has (not to mention the lag)

restart of phone etc isn't making the game register the new score

don't have screenshots because i shouldn't have to take them after every run in case this BS happens. </TEXT>

i average 800 on a bad run and over 1000 on a good run playing 5-10 times a day you end up with a lot more vials then you can ever spend

	<TEXT> progress rewards are 2500 vials and 1 iso 3500 vials 2 iso 10 iso and last prize premium portal and 10 ISO

the entire event (and leaderboard) is based on how many enemies you can kill.. 

doens't matter if you score 20 million it's based on the amount of enemies killed

not sure who gives the bonus if there even is one... i've got 80 enemies so far and i'm in 486th place don't play often enough to score higher in events like these </TEXT>

my multiplier is 33 and if i have a good run i can get around 2.5-3 million average runs if at least 1 million

other then that it's just down to luck.. only use ISO to continue a run if you are sure you can get a higher score for a good prize otherwise it's just a waste </TEXT>

just score enough to get them on the daily leader board or try to get 50 iso-8 and buy the discount ones or get them in events

the later issues will probably go higher then level 90 as they already have a 7 star in the game

hopefully they release all of them as 7 star otherwise it will be a pain in the ass to rank one from 1 to 7 star </TEXT>
