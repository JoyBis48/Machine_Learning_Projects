	<TEXT> I assume you aren't farm boy - so, you should be very careful before you make you decision how you going to do farm work (unless it recreation farm). 
After my graduation I used to be an organic farmer and most important lesson I'd learn was that you don't need PhD or graduation to do this job even more this is mostly useless balance and even simpleton farm boy was much better on this area then me.  
Really small changes what, how, and when you doing could have really big impact for effects.
How to start?  Every thing depend what you decided to growing on your farm, will be this some sort of organic, permaculture production?

I don't want to criticized Marcin's achievement (they did great job) but their farming set isn't ready yet - first you couldn't do all sort of farming jobs on your fields, second: as I came a cross information from replicants, tractor need some sort of repairing wheels after less then 20 miles of run on the road (where it have much less to do than on the field) - (if I'm wrong or miss understanding some info: Marcin, please correct me quickly). I hope they are going to test this sets on the their fields this year - it's spring perfect time for that. And if you couldn't count on some donations you have to concentrate on production where efficiency is the master.
Building community - that's very interesting but much more complicated then starting farming from scratch. Believe me, even here I got my own experience (my idea to organic farming doesn't come from blue sky).

If you interesting in subjects I only just touched, let me know - I'll be more then happy to help you.

	<TEXT> I'm sorry for that. Several years ago I had accident at work - I lose a finger tip. The worst thing was when docs wanted cat off half of the rest - to make me better - treating me that later they will amputate whole. I refused. After 2-3 weeks I went back to work. 
I;m afraid your father hand will be  very, very over sensitive. Up to 3 years each touch this place is really unpleasant.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> you can use this as downlink and 2.5GHz(or so) wireless as uplink cos most of data is downloaded. Speed down on virgin broadband is 30Mbps and up only 2Mbps. Maybe in USA suburbs is not a problem but I got in UK constantly 17 different  wireless in my range and as I remember 2.5GHz band has 11 channels but only 3 are independent. That's mean if you can see more then 3 you have overlapping transmissions. </TEXT>
