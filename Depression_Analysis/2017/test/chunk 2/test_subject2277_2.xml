	<TEXT> From the story;

10% of the OPS is on light duties;

"That senior officer told CFRA there are **130 officers** who cannot do their regular tasks because of things like injury or pregnancy.

"That's 10 per cent of all our sworn staff," the senior officer told CFRA. "That's huge."

I'm told morale is horrible in the OPS, undoubtedly 10% of a force getting out of regular jobs doesn't help. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The fact that this even went to trial is a travesty.

The police and the Crown clearly have too much time on their hands.

This man's life is in shambles. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Semen needs to fertilize an egg.

Semen can never become a human on its own.

I've honestly never heard someone comparing semen to a fetus before.

	<TEXT> I'm happy to see that the police investigated themselves, prosecuted him internally under the PSA, convicted him and then fired him, which was upheld by the OCPC. ( Remember these cases when Canadians claim cops can't investigate themselves)

There **should** be a mechanism in place to suspend officers without pay on a case by case basis.

No such mechanism exists, so dirty and corrupt cops get their top base salary of 90K while they work their way through the system.

So, the government needs to legislate this power, that is currently unavailable to police Chiefs.

The Ontario Association of Chiefs want the ability to suspend with pay on a case by case basis. </TEXT>
