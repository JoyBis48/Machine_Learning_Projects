	<TEXT> Pardon me if I'm wrong, I haven't studied Theory intensely in awhile. I believe it's just a color tone, but the bV would make the chord half diminished. You can resolve it the same way you resolve any normal V chord, or use it as the Dominant of a new key.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I almost forgot to mention that I play a few hours out of the week, but that's because I need to stay on top of my schoolwork. It's tough because I can play this game all day long (as I did this last summer when I wasn't working and played this game for 4-8hrs a day every couple of days or so), but there are some points where I need to go do other things and hang out with RL people. 

Speaking of relationships, how goes the positive approach on yours? I hope it's going well. </TEXT>
