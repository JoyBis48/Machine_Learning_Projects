	<TEXT> You must not have actually read it. 

"Tusk has a lot going for it. Michael Parks has a knack for making Smiths overwritten speeches sound like prose-poems, and Smith doesnt squander that assethe lets Howes long, winding stories anchor the movie. And that Mr. Tusk costume is genuinely horrific, with bloody scars and a general ungainliness that makes the Wallace-walrus look like hes in excruciating discomfort. (Theres a scene about three-quarters of the way through Tusk where Howe forces the man-beast to learn how to swim, and the combination of Wallaces panic and what he finds beneath the water is as terrifying as anything a veteran horror director couldve staged.) Tusk also has some subtle touches that speak to Smiths personality"

	<TEXT> When I opened my eyes in that cabin and I felt the straps on my arms, legs, and across my torso holding me fast to the bed with a tarp beneath me, you better believe I was praying to God for help. It was a one-room building with paneled walls and a musty smell. I must have been where whoever brought me there was sure no one could hear anything that would happen. In the far upper corners there were ceiling mounted cameras aimed at me, red lights on. Along the far wall there was a table with a green plastic sheet over it. There were the tips of instrument handles visible on the table. 

I struggled against the restraints, barely able to move my hands and feet. I screamed and struggled for what had to be at least a minute. I stopped only at the sight of the door opening.

A man stood in the doorway. He was six feet tall at least, fit as an ox, and a little bored. He wore a surgical apron. When I saw that, I began screaming again. He didnt respond as I alternately begged him for mercy and threatened him. He went over to a laptop the cameras were connected to and made some adjustments. He walked over to my side then.

Shut up! he yelled at me, his tone more annoyed and exhausted than angry. I complied.

Okay, checking, checking, audio test, he said. He went back to the laptop and played back what hed just recorded. After a nod of satisfaction, he picked up a piece of paper from next to the laptop. He looked from the paper to me as he read.

Hello from the husband you fucked along with her, he read robotically. 

E-Ellen? I said weakly. Is this about Ellen? But she said that- He looked up at me and I stopped speaking again. He shook his head slightly and continued.

Did the bitch even tell you about me? Are you still hoping youre gonna escape? You still thinking the man who strapped you down is just gonna scare you? Ive seen too much of you with her to ever let you live. Youre gonna die really slowly. Were are gonna watch everything. Youre not the first other man to stick his cock in her but you will be the last. He sighed, crumpled up the paper, and tossed it on one of the tables as he made for the instruments hed laid out.

Without so much as another glance at my face, he came over to me with a scalpel. He spread my largest and second toe on my left foot, and began to cut the webbing. I had never experienced anything like that before and showed no strength in the face of it. I shrieked like an animal.

Make him stop, I thought. Please God, make him stop.

He seemed finished with my left foot and made for my right hand. I tried to clench it into a fist but that did nothing to slow him down. He went for the flesh between my ring and pinkie finger and began to cut. I was dimly aware of mucus touching my lips as I tried to scream.

He stopped after an eternity and stepped back, breathing heavily. I faintly heard the sound of him peeling off his gloves. I begged him to not to continue while he got on two replacement pairs of gloves without acknowledging what I had to say.

He came back to me with a surgical retractor in one hand and the scalpel in the other. He grabbed a section of my lip below the nose in the retractor and pulled it. He pressed the blade of the scalpel against my lip and began to cut.

I couldnt take any more. I hoped hed forgive me.

Medulla! I screeched as loud as I could. Immediately he stopped. He went back to the table hed kept his instruments on.

Okay, hang in there, Joe. Itll be over soon! Ive got the tetracaine ready! Almost immediately after he took away the pain, he got out the kit to give me the stitches. While he was doing that, I actually fell asleep from sheer exhaustion. 

*	*	*

So now Im at our home. Hes downstairs doing the laundry, insisting on doing all the chores now. I dont think Ill be able to walk properly for a few days, but we have our story for how I got injured like this for our coworkers. He has all the written and video evidence he would need to show that it was consensual and that he respected the safety word in case I decide to go to the police or anything. Not that I would do that. 

He told me he was more than satisfied with what wed done. He really liked the little bit Id come up with about Ellen. Thats left me pretty satisfied too. Anything for him. I love him so much. I should have let him go farther. Next time Im sure I will. It wont be for some time of course. 

He's got a partner that will let him live out his fantasies. He didn't dare tell any of his old lovers about this fetish. He didn't hesitate to stop when I said the word. He loves me.

I know this goes far beyond a normal S M relationship, but it doesnt matter. He's never going to do this to anyone else. Not to someone who doesn't know the safety word. He's definitely never going to just keep going until I can't say the word. He loves me.

I haven't just given him a taste. I haven't made him want to go farther so much he won't be able to stop next time. He loves me. Hes not going to cut anyone else. Please God, hes not.

Please, oh please God.

	<TEXT> No, it's really mostly obvious bullshit. Accomplishments and skills do not make people [inherently happier](http://www.nj.com/parenting/index.ssf/2014/08/post_42.html) so your pie in the sky hopes that all you have to do is get a job with specialized skills or a promotion so you can fuck someone and its all better. That metaphor of how being a "nice person" is useless is obviously Pargin justifying his own and other people's dickishness based on professional desirability. Creating stuff often doesn't "increase your value as a human being" most of the time because many of us don't have the means to make our products do anything or share them with significant numbers of people or have a significant impact on those we can reach.    

I think people are overly impressed by this article because he isn't offering easy answers, but he's still offering simple answers that aren't true. Read his article about stuff you don't learn in school and he blatantly admits in there that he lucked into the position at Cracked that compels anyone to pay attention to him.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I've had this idea for the past few days and I wanted to know what you guys around here would think of it. I don't know if it would benefit from actually being shot like a silent film. 

The premise would be that some modern equivalent to Charlie Chaplin's Tramp character would be in a zombie outbreak, more or less going about his usual business by basically dodging zombie hordes through a series of improvised setups and gymnastic abilities. One day he runs into a female survivalist who is the last of her group. He becomes smitten with her and imagines her as a delicate flower despite her in reality being tough and completely uninterested in him except for he knows how to get where she wants to go safely. As they make their way there, she insists on killing zombies (sometimes gratuitously) but he is completely abhorrent of the idea, arguing that some day they might be cured. 

That's all I've got in mind for the story right now. I just wanted to see the reaction around here to it.  </TEXT>
