	<TEXT> it now comes to the point whether you can reliably apply the cc, correctly

for example, tf's stun card takes time </TEXT>

	<TEXT> the support role cannot just be filled by anyone

all adcs are viable, but not every adc can fit into just any team comp

some people try to be unconventional with adc lulu, adc ahri, adc kennen, etc </TEXT>

	<TEXT> not all of them are viable, so the number is actually lower

compared to adc which have 18
it makes sense at least 15 should be enough </TEXT>

	<TITLE> there are simply not enough support champions </TITLE>

	<TEXT> simply put: there are not enough champions to fill in the role and it gets tedious trying to rotate among them (I counted 14 using my definition) when there isn't a lot to begin with. you can only play leona so much before you go crazy

the way I define support is: can you stop kat ult? (reliably, such as in the case of morgana, is a different story though)
this is what honestly is keeping the support role from being able to fit in other champions. if we just nerfed (preferably delete) katarina then this will be better.

1) traditional supports:
-alistar
-blitzcrank
-braum
-janna
-leona
-lulu
-nami
-sona
-soraka
-thresh
-taric
total: 11

2) mages that went support
-annie
-fiddlesticks
-morgana
-vel'koz
-zyra
total: 5

3) situational supports or those that fail to meet the criteria (usually no hard cc)
-lux
-kayle
-karma
-zilean
-all other mages </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Saying her spear does less damage is not exactly fixing. The spear can still do a lot: if it used to be 90% of health it's 70% of health, so that reduction is not meaningful, plus she can just go in and execute. She's strong range and melee.

These are not counterplay:
Dodge the spear,
Cc her,
She has to put herself at 'risk'(what about a champion like talon?) </TEXT>
