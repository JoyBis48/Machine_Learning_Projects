It is really hard for people to get it in the first place. Also, the price is increasing because demand for it is increasing. Volcanic Deck hype. Supply isn't really increasing and there is a finite amount at the moment.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Keep the Shift. Strategy makes the game interesting because the defense is not stagnant in the same positions. 

If MLB wanted more runs and offense, Put the DH in the National League. An average MLB pitcher is almost 85%+ a guaranteed out. They are worse than the worst actual batter in any lineup.

If you want drastic changes to rules to boost offense, How about don't count all fouls as strikes? Why 2 strikes and a foul = nothing happens, yet first 2 fouls = strikes? Why not have all fouls = strikes to speed up the game? </TEXT>

The league does need to reform its parity, rules, free agency, and money. If the league takes a loss this year, projected growth says that the league will continue to grow, so taking debt now, won't necessarily impact the league finances in the long-term.

	<TEXT> True. I just don't want Obama to be labeled as "anti-energy" when he clearly isn't. Also, signing Keystone prevents Conservatives from blaming him for rising gas prices, if they were to rise. Also, I don't think many rural conservative voters understand the hazards of the Pipeline. I say let them deal with environmental hazards, if they leak. Though....Congress could just sign Keystone by bypassing Obama's veto and take all the blame, if environmental damages were to occur.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> What to do when Residential, Commercial, and Industrial Demand are all negative? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-01-12 00:26:33 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> My central city used to be mostly $$, $$$, and some $ people with manufacturing, high-tech, and $$ and $$$ businesses. It had good schools and good health services. I have neighboring cities with 100% $ people, $ business, and dirty. Then suddenly, $ people started rising and a lot of $$ and $$$ businesses +apartments started to decay or abandon. Jobs weren't demanded. Commute Time increasing. Budget was in free-fall....

To combat this:

1. I did readjust taxes in all my neighboring cities with 20% taxes on everything except dirty to encourage them to move to my major city. 

2. My city was in financial disaster. Budget Deficits and Low Cash. I decreased all residential taxes down to 4% to encourage people to come. Increased the Commercial and Industrial Taxes to around 11%. Slashed funding to health, police, ordinances. Ran on a surplus for some months. Slowly restored police and health funding. Took out 2 loans to get me to $500,000 in cash and roughly 1k to 2k budget deficit.

Now, my finances are in order mostly with positive demand for $ and $$ residential, but how I do actually grow and increase demand for industry and commercial? Any tips?  </TEXT>

Though, I want Obama to sign Keystone, even though I am pretty liberal on environmental issues. 

Obama has other issues to draw lines before the 2016 election like Trade, Budgets, Taxation, etc. Making an environmental line on energy, when energy production has been increasing under Obama's administration isn't a good strategy for Democrats. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes. Many politicians do that as well, if they know how to do it effectively. Also, it depends on how motivated you are. - How you value Keystone against winning politically?

It isn't really regressive. Also, you do have options of public transit, which if you live near public transit, you could save money.
