	<TEXT> For me...cold weather school delays.  As a kid, that was the best news I could get in the morning while watching Bobby's World and eating strawberry poptarts.  Now as an adult, I have to make last minute plans to get my daughter to school and possibly be late to work if I have to end up taking her myself.  I can understand delays for snow and ice (I'm from SC), but today my daughter has a 2 hour delay...with dry roads, no snow, no sleet, and no ice anywhere. 

So why the delay?!  Are schools training our children to be a bunch of testicles that can't take the cold?  I'm just waiting for the day when she has a delay because the sun is too hot.

Maybe I feel like they're cutting her education short (over multiple "non-necessary" weather delays)...maybe I'm just bitter.  I don't have a delay for my job.  Meh. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> IMO, it depends on the degree of the accident.
  
Leaving vehicles involved in a traffic accident in the middle of the road (that could easily be moved to the side of the road) can cause traffic congestion and possibly another wreck down the line.  
  
If it's at all possible (car is capable of being moved, no one involved in the wreck is seriously injured, etc.)...it's a wise move to clear the road.
