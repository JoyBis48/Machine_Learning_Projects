	<TEXT> Immediately after the announcement, I tried to feel sad that I didn't win. And I tried. But I couldn't feel sad. There was no reason to (aside from the lack of communication between the hosts and participants). I would have made Running Red anyway, I'd had the idea for a while, but this competition just gave me a reason not to procrastinate. It wasn't about winning. It was about making a good pack. And I feel I have done that. I've made a pack that sends a message, and is unique, which is something that rarely happens these days. I've accomplished my goal, and gone far above it. Running Red got listed, which is something I've only dreamed of. @PurpleMentat , who has always been one of my favorite Youtubers, did a series on my pack. Plus, I tied what is currently the most popular modpack. I consider that to be a huge achievement. I'm happy to have been part of this competition. It wasn't about winning. It was about sending a message. And you know what, I accomplished my goal.

Thank you for all that you've done, and congratulations to Parcel. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I had this dream that the results were leaked to Panda and then we grilled him for information. He didn't say anything, and then the results were released.

You won, because you had a Mini-Me of Slowpoke101. Slowpoke said in the dream post that there was no other reason.

It was the worst nightmare ever. </TEXT>
