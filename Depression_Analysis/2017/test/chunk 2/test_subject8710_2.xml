	<TEXT> of all the champions in league i only have four left and seeing as i don't care to extremly about which ones i get i thought i would ask here for who i should buy my options are
Varus
Zyra
Galio
Kogma
if you can describe a champion well enough to where its almost like what choice to i have to buy them then ill probably instantly buy them instead of waiting for tahm kench (seeing as i buy the bundles anyway) </TEXT>
