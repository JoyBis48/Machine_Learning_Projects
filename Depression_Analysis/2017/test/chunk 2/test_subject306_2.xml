	<TEXT> If you choose not to attend the wedding, don't tell the fiance either.  My reasoning, is that you're choosing to cut him out of your life completely.  You're acknowledging that he is not your brother.  However by informing the fiance, you're now taking a step back into his life.  Furthermore you're potentially opening up old wounds.  

If you're going to tell the fiance, send a letter, no return address so they don't know who it's from.  At least this way you're not getting caught up in the BS </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Exactly this.  I'd like to know the backstory to this.  Was there hardcore texts being passed back n forth?  Were they drunk as hell?  It was their first time hooking up, and they went dominant rough right from the start.  That's an open invitation right there.  I'm not saying what the guy did was right, but there's many variables that come into play here.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What kind of messages were said back and forth leading up to this?    Clearly this guy took it overboard and violated you, but if you showed signs of wanting to be dominated and taken, this goes both ways.  This was your first time hooking up, you're gonna be going 100 m.p.h with excitement and such.

You've got to pony up a little bit and think what drove this guy to lose it.  Was there booze involved, how many texts back and forth were there, nature of conversation, etc.  Cops are gonna be all over this asking you how you even allowed him to enter your house and hook up?  As much as you are the victim here, when the cops question you and the incident, you need to make sure everything adds up.  There is a huge grey area when it comes to this unfortunately.

	<TEXT> Japanese fella here.  Although the dad is clearly being abusive, it's sorta common for the men to just yell at their wives.  It's Old School mentality.  Is it right?  Absolutely not, but the mom doesn't have alot of options. It's not like here in the states where there's support groups, organizations etc.  Sadly, psycho social support in Japan is not on top of the list.  

And unless there is complete followthru, I actually disagree and she shouldn't inform the organization.  She's only staying for a year or two tops, it's a different dynamic she's witnessing than if she were there for 5 years.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not sure how much football you've watched or understand, but it takes all 11 players to do their job in order for the play to happen.  Not the 3 out of 11 being a meat shield.  

And from a different perspective, when a play goes right, whether it's a 60 yd run TD, or a 45 yd pass, sometimes it's [poetry in motion](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qN1SFA2UDOc feature=related) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm simply calling you out on your "I'm from Texas" statement.  Your references of beef, eggs, and music are all 1 dimensional.  If Texas was even remotely as diverse as SF, I wouldn't even trip.  
 
For example, what's Texas eggs? Drenched in oil, butter, add tons bacon, potatoes.  I don't have an issue if you don't like Japanese eggs, but again I wouldn't bet the house on anything culinary from Texas.  Who is your famous chef?  Tim Love, cmon now.    

Texas Music, first that comes to mind, twangy whack ass country music.  Again how many dimensons?  I can say legitimately that SF is diverse and we can back up our arguments across the board from music to food.  And yes I'm also Japanese so I do know the culture and the gentle complex flavors that are associated with our food.  

Finally fuck the Cowboys!  </TEXT>
