	<TEXT> I always feel a bit weird telling people about how bears are my favorite animals. Shortly after, I have to explain to them that it's in no way a sexual reason. Yeah... Grizzly Bears are my favorite. I even like the bad, too, haha! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yup, you're right about that on both parts! From what I know of Superman, he seems to be overpowered, a bit. But Doomsday did manage to kill him! He was then brought back to life, I don't know how, though. 
EDIT
I also heard, this is pretty recent, that Supes is getting new powers. I personally feel like he doesn't need any more, but it will be interesting to see how that turns out.  </TEXT>
