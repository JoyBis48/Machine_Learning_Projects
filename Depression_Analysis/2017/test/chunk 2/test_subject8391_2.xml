	<TEXT> I don't know enough about James Wilson or whether this is accurate to respond to this. Part of the problem is she jumps about and talks about a lot more than just the pledge of allegiance. Need some help on the best way to respond to this argument. This was her response after I explained that God was added to the pledge of allegiance in 1954 and explaining the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.

"What is been taken away is the freedom to acknowledge God in schools and government arenas ...that was never the intent of the Founding Fathers.....Just because the did not the phrase "under God" until later it does not reflect the original intention. Founding Father, James Wilson, Supreme Court Judge He was appointed by George Washington to the Supreme Court. He served for nine years. 

Signed the Dec. of Ind. And the Constitution His legal lectures (three books) were used in the first organized legal training for law students. You can still get copies of those books. Here is what he said. Law made for men and nations flows from the same divine source the law of God, what we do must be founded on what he has done. The deficiency of our laws must be supplied by the perfections of his. 

Human law must rest its authority ultimately upon the authority of that law which is Divine. 

In factthe early court made numerous decision defending the Ten Commandments. You were just as likely to find the Ten Commandments hanging in a government building and school, as you were a church. 

Marshall said the Ten Commandments must be fundamental precepts of our civil society 

Quotes from George Washington: 

You do well to wish to learn our arts and ways of life, and above all, the religion of Jesus Christ. These will make you a greater and happier people than you are. 

While we are zealously performing the duties of good citizens and soldiers, we certainly ought not to be inattentive to the higher duties of religion. To the distinguished character of Patriot, it should be our highest glory to add the more distinguished character of Christian. The blessing and protection of Heaven are at all times necessary but especially so in times of public distress and danger. The General hopes and trusts that every officer and man will endeavor to live and act as becomes a Christian soldier, defending the dearest rights and liberties of his country. 

I now make it my earnest prayer that God would most graciously be pleased to dispose us all to do justice, to love mercy, and to demean ourselves with that charity, humility, and pacific temper of the mind which were the characteristics of the Divine Author of our blessed religion."

	<TEXT> It helped me make a decision. I usually fly to LA from SF bay area and rent a car, but I decided to rent a car and spend a day driving down there next month. The cost is about the same (an extra two days of rental car + gas = plane ticket), but it does mean a lot more time - something I am willing to accept to avoid the screening machines. 

Unfortunately, this isn't going to be possible for many of the longer flights that I must take, but I'm hoping if enough people start opting out of shorter flights, the airlines will also start to place pressure on this issue. </TEXT>
