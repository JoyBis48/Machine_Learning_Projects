	<TEXT> Shit. Okay. Eventually she's going to threaten you if you don't keep typing. She won't speak to you she'll just be reading over your shoulder. Warren called her Mel but I guess maybe he misheard her. Either way you need to get the hell out of there now. </TEXT>

Loon calls are also creepy as hell. I've heard some odd stuff I couldn't place especially when I lived in the woods. Owls sound like a woman being murdered.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I second the fox theory. I seriously woke up in the middle of the night and made my ex go out with a flashlight because it sounded exactly like a screaming newborn and I couldn't rationalize the noise. I was also terrified (thanks nosleep.) It was a fox standing in the middle of the road in front of my house making the noise.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey people who know about doppelgangers! Is it odd for your doppelganger to do things you do, including dating your significant other's doppelganger? I dated a woman for a few years after my son's father and I broke up and we would hear at least twice a week that we had just been wherever we were, or someone had seen us around town while we were actually on vacation, etc. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I totally agree with the things with emotional significance keeping you safe. When I was a kid a lot of strange stuff happened to/around me. My parents got me a dog after my grandfather asked who I was playing with, while I was playing alone in the yard. They won't admit that's why they got her, of course. But I had her for 18 years and when she passed away we had her cremated so she could continue to keep me safe. My room (where her ashes are) is still the safest one in the house. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The anniversary could easily be a stresser for him, causing him to act out of character especially since he wouldn't know exactly what to do with his feelings.

	<TEXT> OP if your brother has a regular doctor, I'd contact them and have him seen asap. Something may have scared him and he can't deal with it properly or something. My only experience with autism is my 4 year old nephew so the traits may manifest differently with age, but I know when Evvy is confused or can't process something, he acts VERY strange and sometimes creepy. </TEXT>
