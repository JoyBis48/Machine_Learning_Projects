	<TITLE> Sisters drug addiction and my moms struggle. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-04-08 04:38:51 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit to post on. If it isn't give me the right one please but anyway. In January my family and I had discovered my sister had developed a nasty addiction to heroin and prescription pills. We sent her to rehab and she had gone for 4 months and she had just gotten out last week. The day she got out she relapsed, she started using cocaine. She had confessed to my parents and I. We had no clue what to do, so we started taking part in IOP (intensive out patient). She goes 3 times a week and gets tested, she has been passing but even so my parents have been super anxious, my parents are divorced. My dad does not show too much emotion but he does eat a lot of sugar and he has diabetes which is clearly not good for his health. My mom who I live with predominately has been pushing a lot of home renovations on herself and I. She said to me today "I rearrange furniture in my own house cause it is the only thing that I can control." I can't get it out of my head, it is just something that I thought was so deep. She does everything around the house and pushes way too much work on herself. My sister is in Vineland and then off to Woodbury if anyone knows where that is. I'm so anxious and so are my parents. Anything we can do you guys think we can do to calm our nerves? Thank you. </TEXT>
