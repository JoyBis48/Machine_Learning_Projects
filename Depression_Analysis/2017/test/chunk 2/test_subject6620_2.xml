What type of certification will districts be looking for? How big is the pool of applicants in respect to the number of positions open?

	<TEXT> I guess you need to look at economic/social trends in Eastern Europe. I live in an area with a high population of new immigrants from Poland. BMWs, iphones, and flashy clothing is very ubiquitous among this group. (much different from my Polish relatives who came here ~100 years ago, who primarily came in a wave of lesser-skilled labor)

A number of the 21st Century immigrants are probably coming here for work because of their technical or specialized knowledge. </TEXT>

It really takes a special kind of person to become an MD, and it really only pays more in the long run, considering that 4yrs of medical school + being an intern + the cost of school-related debt and malpractice insurance etc., etc., ...I cannot imagine that most MDs are making good money until they are past 30.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Is pursuing an accounting career smart in today's job market? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2012-10-30 22:04:43 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Here is my situation: 24 y/o BA in Secondary Education; BA in History.

After two unsuccessful summers of not landing a full-time position as a history teacher, I am planning to do something more practical in place of the subject that I feel passionate about. The economic incentives of being a substitute teacher or a private school teacher are non-existent. I make more in my current position at a reading clinic/ my union weekend job.

From a purely practical/economic perspective, does it make sense for me to jump into a Masters of Science in Accounting program? 

It seems that the opportunities are more bountiful in this field, and if I strike out at landing a teaching job next year I'm probably going to give up anyway. Assuming that I can complete CPA certification, I probably can use a family connection to help me land a position in the accounting field. Just wanted to know if there is anything beneath the surface that would make it equally difficult for me in this field.

Thanks!

	<TEXT> [This video] (http://www.empireofsoccer.com/flashback-vid-the-nasl-shootout-new-york-cosmos-v-washington-diplomats/) shows the intensity and suspense that were present in NASL shootouts. The league really had a few glory moments. Pele came to the New York Cosmos, and for a while fans were thrilled and passionate. 

I watched the movie "Once in a Lifetime" the story of the New York Cosmos, and it seemed like the league could have created a whole new soccer experience for Americans.

I wasn't alive to experience the NASL, so my question for those who were is this: Why did it fizzle out?

The new "Skyactiv" engine gets the best fuel economy in its class and is actually more fuel-efficient than Mazda's subcompact Mazda 2. Additionally, the long-term costs are projected to be low considering the trends of the Mazda 3's build quality and reliability over the past few years. The price is not that much different than the Cruze or Focus either.

I wish i was in the market for one today. </TEXT>
