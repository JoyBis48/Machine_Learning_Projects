	<TEXT> Try some different beers. I can't stand lager, which is what people generally think of when they say 'beer'. The clear slightly yellow bubbly liquid that tastes like carbonated piss. 


Try a stout, porter or amber ale. They have a bit more balls and flavor to them. If you're American you should be able to get you hands on Brooklyn Brown Ale fairly easily. Australian, try the Holgate Chocolate Porter.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So now I suffer somewhat from nerve damage, from the waist down.. but shiiit, I can walk, shit, piss and fuck, I am really, really lucky.


My bro broke his neck too, and even though he's pretty crippled we all just consider it awesome that he can walk, shit and get a boner. You really only need three things when it comes down to it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As a girl I'd like to know total number of orgasms, from sex and masturbation separately. I can give myself like 8 orgasms in a 10 minute sesh if I'm in the mood. And technically that's only masturbating once.  </TEXT>
