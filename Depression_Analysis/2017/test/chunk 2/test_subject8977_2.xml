	<TEXT> Wow, I just read that comment too! 

I know everyone has a different situation, but I just came out to 160 of my fraternity brothers and was called, texted, and messaged from so many of them saying that they were proud of me and that they loved me!

The only advice I have for someone in the closet is to come out when you're ready, but don't take forever!

	<TEXT> Well, at least your Mom didn't use your laptop one day only to find that you didn't catch that hidden gay porn pop-up window that pushes itself to the back of all of your open windows.

That was a fun conversation.
