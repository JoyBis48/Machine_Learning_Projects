	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT>   Now don't get me wrong, there economic system was great. There was no such thing as poor in their society. They also were very good at making remedies for injuries and diseases and were skilled warriors. They survived against all odds. Now, I did't come here to argue over who is more developed. 
  I'm just wondering why was it that Europeans had gunpowder, more advanced science, advanced corporations and armies. They also had ships that could cross entire oceans and some of the Europeans had mastered the art of Gliding (People like Otto Lilienthal). 
 Why is it that they were technologically superior the the natives? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It seems like it would be pretty chaotic. With the eruption of Toba and the impending Ice Ages. 
  Similar skirmishes probably happened when Homo Erectus, Neanderthal, and Sapien existed together 80,000 to 100,000 years ago.
  Homo Sapiens had the evolutionary advantage. They crafted bow and arrows, which were devastating weapons back then. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>   My favorite theory for the Neanderthal demise is the one where it is thought that humans helped drive the Neanderthals to extinction. Some sort of inter species war. A battle for resources and land.
