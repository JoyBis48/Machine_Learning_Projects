	<TEXT> I remember this guy. He used to be full of cringe and bullshit. He would make videos where he drank two bottles of vodka with no hands in 45 seconds and crazy stuff like that, and then he would upload videos saying he would never upload a drinking video again, swearing on his mother's grave. Then he would upload two more and delete the last video. Also he ran for that "KingOfTheWeb" thing where the winner would get some cash prize, and Shoenice had a smear campaign where he would trash the people who were beating him (usually teenaged make-up gurus), and he would encourage his fans to cheat and make multiple accounts to vote for him, and then he freaked out when he was banned. I used to message back and forth arguing with him and he would constantly lie and brag about his YouTube money and how he was so much better than me because he was making his living eat glue on street corners for YouTube. It was pretty funny, and pretty sad. </TEXT>
