	<TEXT> I moved here not long ago and have already done the main things. Also went to the elephant house recently and stopped by a cool shop called Joe. Does anyone know any cool wee places to go? Preferably not including museums, monuments or anything like that. Also does anyone know if there are any cool themed restaurants or cafes or anything? Thank you!

Edit: Thanks to everyone who has recommended a place to go. I will definitely be trying to get to all of these the next time I'm out exploring Edinburgh City.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There is a girl who is an orphan and lives with maids of a house (its set in either the 19th or 20th century). She either finds an amulet or is in possession of an amulet. Either way, word gets around and a woman comes knocking claiming to be her mother, who takes her away to live with her. I think part of the book is set in Venice. In the end, the girl realizes that the woman was not her mother but forgives her anyway. Does anyone know this book? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> I am going in to get a diagnosis tomorrow and was wondering if anyone had any tips to someone who gets anxious when talking about feelings and personal issues? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> I have avoided talking about personal things and my true feelings since I can remember and am really anxious about my doctor's appointment today. Just to be prepared I have printed out a PHQ and filled it in but I'm still really nervous and panicky. Any tips?

EDIT: Thanks everyone! I had my appt. and it went really well. She was straightforward, actually listened to me and then gave me a perscription and told me to use my free uni councelling service. It really helped that I braught with me the PHQ. I now have a perscription for fluoxetine. </TEXT>
