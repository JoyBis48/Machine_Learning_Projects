However when i view the "on sale" tab in the shop it says that gangsta twitch that's on sale, not vandal.

	<TEXT> i really feel like you shouldn't force us to pick what champion we'd like to play and instead allow us to just queue for the position we want so that it could be used for ranked draft pick. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I played 2 before i played 1 and i have to say it didn't really change much, i fell in love with BL2 and it was that that made me want to play BL1. The story is BL1 is SERIOUSLY BAD i learn almost nothing playing through the game and ended up googling most of it to piece the story together. So in conclusion play which ever you like first :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Im sorry for your loss, i truly am :/ and yeah i agree the whole "it gets easier" shit people say is a bunch of bollocks, the highest suicide rates in america are white males above the age of 80 and people are saying it gets better!? That said I think you'll go far buddy, school was something i never did too well at, but keep studying hard if school is something you can deal with. </TEXT>
