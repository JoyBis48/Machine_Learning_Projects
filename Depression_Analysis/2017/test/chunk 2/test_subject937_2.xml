	<TEXT> My personal experience definitely confirms this. I wore it from 7:45 am until 8:45 pm yesterday and it had ~30% left.

I responded to texts, used navigation, controlled music in the car, received various notifications throughout the day, and checked the time several times. I would consider my usage moderate to heavy.

This is a dramatic increase from the battery before the update. I was going to return the damn thing and now I don't think I will. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Why? Seriously? It's literally a Representative's job to be responsive to constituents. This sort of thing could _really_ piss someone off, particularly the type of person who takes the time to contact their Representative twice about the same issue.

And you don't need unique letters for each person, just succeeding letters: 1st inquiry, 2nd inquiry, etc. And probably after the second, a valid response would be "My position hasn't changed since the last letter." Hell, even that would be better than sending the same letter the second time.

It'd be as simple as a spreadsheet. Even small businesses handle more workflow than that... </TEXT>

When in unfamiliar towns on back roads, there are often a lot of turns. I was behind an impromptu caravan and they all went right when I thought I was supposed to go left. I had about 3 seconds to decide and the watch allowed me to verify to go left.

Not much but it was pretty damn nice. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Does it though? I assume this is the source of your claim:

The medieval town is mainly famous for its stone bridge over the Danube, built between 1135 and 1146... To complete the construction of this bridge, Roman workers counted on Bavarian sausages to keep them going.

Sausages were sold there at that time but there isn't any indication that sausages have been sold there continuously since 1146. And even if they have been, it doesn't seem that it's been the same business:

The recent owners of the restaurant purchased it in 1806 from the Regensburg State authority.

It's an impressive building for sure and it may have been used only as a sausage restaurant when actually in use, but there is nothing in the article to really support the claim that there has been the same business there for 900 years (which is what the title claims). </TEXT>

Not using pronouns in English is very difficult if you have more than a brief interaction with the person. I sit on the board of a statewide LGBT organization and one of our interns is transgendered (F to M). He and I were scheduled to spend an entire day together and I ultimately had to ask our Executive Director for guidance. As for his name, it was completely neutral and provided no additional information. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not trying to find racism. That's not what this is about. This is about the patently absurd notion that today's GOP - if teleported back in time - would be the ideological party of Lincoln.

And still no sources from you... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Voting patterns changed in part due to how the parties [reacted](http://www.npr.org/blogs/codeswitch/2014/07/14/331298996/why-did-black-voters-flee-the-republican-party-in-the-1960s) to the Civil Rights movement. Republicans have not changed their position on economic issues, but they have on social issues.

And how about providing sources rather than calling people names? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Inheriting wealth seems quite antithetical to hard work, personal responsibility, and meritocracy. It should at best be viewed as something we put up with for other reasons (e.g., property rights).

In fact, inheritance should be viewed as embarrassing. Those who inherit should have a much higher standard for personal success. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi, /r/charleston! My boyfriend and I are planning a quick one night visit and are looking for a nice bed and breakfast. Suggestions?

We are looking for something secluded and preferably on the water (marsh, coastal seaway, ocean). Relaxation is our goal so being near nightlife is not important. Oh, and gay-friendly is a must.

Thanks in advance! </TEXT>
