	<TEXT> So my prescription ran out like two weeks ago and I haven't been able to go see my doctor since then. First week was terrible. I had gotten off on my medication I've before during the two years I have been on them so I knew roughly what to expect. I thought I could get them this past week, but my new job and school didn't give me any time to go to my hometown doctor. So now it's been a fee weeks and I feel again. The brain zaps have stopped too. I am supposed to start therapy again soon, but now I don't want to go back on meds. I feel good. I.didn't realize I was.zombied while on meds. I've felt so many emotions lately and it's great. Had anyone experienced something similar? I'm seeing my doctor tomorrow and I don't know if I want to start meds again. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I was watching cosmos last night and NDT described the knowledge that all things are made of star stuff as spiritual. I've always immediately dismissed the word spiritual or anything people claim as spiritual. Now that I'm older I feel that spirituality doesn't have to be incompatible with atheism, but I don't know how they can coexist. Thoughts? How do you define your spirituality? Is it something intrinsically human that we as atheists are trying to suppress?  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Tripping while depressed? </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I've been diagnosed with depression and anxiety for two years now. I've also been on medication and attended therapy. I feel like I've made no progress. And I'm tired of it. Lately I've had the thought of taking shrooms or acid to see if that helps my depression. I've read lots of anecdotal trip reports where people claim if helped with theirs. I have experimented with psychedelics before, but never more than stupid swaying or mild visuals? Has anyone had the type of experience I'm looking for? </TEXT>
