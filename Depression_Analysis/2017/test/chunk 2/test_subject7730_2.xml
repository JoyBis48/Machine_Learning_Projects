	<TITLE> PKA Idea: Black Mirror </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-07-12 02:59:54 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> This is a suggestion for the PKA crew to watch. Woody, in PKA 238, said he wanted to stream movies and I immediately thought of Black Mirror. WATCH EPISODE TWO, this is a tv show like 'The Twilight Zone' only it is a more modern, rated-r version. I would love you guys to give theories on what you think the second episode (the best episode) symbolizes because there is a lot a room for interpretation.

Edit: I think Kyle may have mentioned this show before on PKA. He may have already seen it so idk. </TEXT>
