	<TEXT> Thanks!

I'm not sure if it's customary to reply to comments, but it's my first submission and to hear someone enjoyed it means a lot to me.

I'm especially glad you were pleased with the ending. Maybe more of a thriller than a horror!

If you have any critique I would be very open to hearing it. </TEXT>
