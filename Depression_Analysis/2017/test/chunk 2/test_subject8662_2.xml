	<TEXT> Internet hug for you. I deal with some minor anxiety, but nothing major. I'm involved in theatre and I worked for my college's res life department so I know quite a few transsexuals and know that in the early years it can be tough. Hang in there and if you ever need to talk you can pm me.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've actually been suicidal twice in my life, to the point of almost acting upon it. What's somewhat fucked up is what stops me is other people. I've always cared much more about the well being of others than my own, and I couldn't stand the idea of someone I love finding the body.

Also, though I'm straight I'm going to co opt this, the hope and assurance that it will get better gives me something to shoot for.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It has cost me jobs in the past simply by me being too apathetic to get out and look, but at the moment, and I can't believe I'm saying this, I'm luckily broke as shit. I say that because I have two roomates and a dog depending on me, so even when I don't give a shit about taking care of myself, I'm beholden to them so I can drag myself up. 

But yes on a regular basis I cannot bring myself to do what should be basic tasks like getting up and going to class. I take 3 classes a week, I'm in my last semester, and when things were at their worst this year I was missing weeks at a time. 

The exhaustion may be linked to the depression mixed with working a full time job and commuting to school. I'm glad to only have 1 more month of this.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> At the moment we're starting me off on prozac. We'll increase my dosage until I get to a point where it's not helping or I reach a degree of normalcy. The problem with Prozac is there can be side effects including the little general going permanently awol that may need to be taken care of with other meds, but we'll cross that bridge when we get there.

If I hit a wall with the Prozac, we'll look at moving me on to a more expensive cocktail of drugs but hopefully it won't come to that. Prozac is cheap and effective.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You should. As I said above, if you feel like somethings wrong, I cannot express enough ho important it is to see someone. It could just be that your stressed and overwhelmed, it could be that you have a chemical imbalance. Either way it's best to get a helping hand before anything becomes too much to handle. I let it get that far a couple of time and it almost ended really badly. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They do have different classifications for types of depression like any other illness. The one that I have just happens to be two different categories mixing together.

The thing with any mental health profession that most people don't realize is that a lot of it we still don't understand. We know what does and doesn't work in terms of treatment, but the why of it all, (i.e. why does the chemical imbalance start, why do certain medicines work) is still all in the very hypothetical at this point. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's fairly constant. The way my psychiatrist put it is, we all have good days and bad, but we mostly live at an emotional normal. A center line if you want to look at it like a graph. I'm constantly in the lower hemisphere of that and rarely if ever reach another persons emotional norm.

Put it another day. When an average person comes home after a long day; not necessarily terrible but not great either, and they're tired, somewhat fed up, and just want to lay down and rest? That's the happiest I feel with any amount of consistency. 

The depression itself I would say is worse because I have a fairly good support system that helps get me through. The worst thing though is feelings of complete helpless loneliness. I live with a roommate and their SO. They do what they can, but there's still a puzzle piece missing that neither can provide. At least not without causing a much larger amount of drama than it's worth. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A couple of minor things here and there, increased lethargy, ambivalence. The major one though was a few weeks ago I lost 10 hours. I work in a place where my day is split between two sites. I work in one for 7 hours, and another across the street for the last two. A few weeks ago I was gathering my things to leave at 7, and then woke up at 5 o'clock in my bed.

The fucked up part is I seemed to have functioned normally in the in between time. No one mentioned any abnormal behavior at work. I drove myself home, and actually made an appointment with a psychologist, so I must have known something was not right. 

We're not sure yet if that is related to the depression, if it was just extreme exhaustion, or if it's something else physical. More tests coming. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's esentially when you have dysthmia mixed with a major depressive disorder. 

Dysthymia is the more common thing that most people will get at some point in their lives. It's minor and usually non recurring, but when it does recur, it can be overwhelming and crippling. When people say they feel trapped and can never feel happy, that's usually recurring Dysthymia. 

Double depression takes that and combines it with a major depressive disorder. Which has a quicker onset and greater initial impact. So when you mix the two together, it's like taking on someone else's heavy camping backpack while you're already lugging two armfuls of your own shit up a hill. </TEXT>
