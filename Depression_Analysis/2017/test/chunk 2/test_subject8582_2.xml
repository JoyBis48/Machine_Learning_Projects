The Victini I will be using in this battle, however, has some improvements. In one hand it is using Excalibur, and in the other it wields the Lance of Longinus (the Bible one). It is also being watched over by its patron god, Nike. To top it off, this Victini is wearing a brand new set of plot armor. With all this on it, who can still bring it down? </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> [The tardigrade](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tardigrade)

One of these has been mutated to the size of 100 meters, with all its existing powers scaled up. In addition, it also has the ability to breathe radiation (think Godzilla's atomic breath) if it absorbs enough before firing. The fight will take place in one of three places:

1: A Forest, with the pond that the Tardigrade originated in. It is not near any towns, but there are wildlife and people there if your character still has morals. 

2: Tokyo. Come on, it's a giant monster, how is it *not* going to attack Tokyo? The fight will begin at 4pm Tokyo time. This is real-world Tokyo, so they don't have Mechagodzilla or any variation thereof. 

3: The ISS. Combatants will have to bounce off of space debris to attack, as well as contending with Newton's third law.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Titan Shifter Mothra vs. Super Saiyan Godzilla </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Mothra discovers that she can grow into a Titan version of herself and grow by 1000%. As a Titan, she has an increased healing factor and is only vulnerable in the nape of her neck (which I guess is right below the skull for her), which is where her original body is located. She also gets the crystallization thing that the Female Titan did. 

At the same time, Godzilla discovers that he's part Saiyan (somehow) and can become a super saiyan. In this state, he is 50X more powerful in every regard and drains energy quicker. 


Being the Kaiju they are, the have no choice but to use their newfound powers and do battle in Tokyo.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My perfect fighter is as follows: 

Begin with Godzilla. All the feats and abilities of every Godzilla combined. Next, add in the wings of Mothra, scaled appropriately. Add in Saiyan DNA and have him be trained by Goku and Vegeta. He has the ability to become SSJ3 maximum. He also absorbs Kryptonian DNA and gets all Superman's powers. He gains the mind of Rational Man With a Shotgun and invests in Wayne Enterprises, making him the richest monster alive. He somehow becomes a Titan Shifter and the Dragonborn, gaining all abilities related to that, once again scaled up (about 750%). He gains scaled up Sonic's legs and ability to transform, then gains 400 rings and the Super Emeralds (meaning he's Hyper Sonic now). His biggest Form now pilots a scaled up Evangelion Unit-01, wielding a scaled-up Lance of Longinus. His Evangelion now has all his powers because of reasons. His bones and his Evangelion are made of Adamantium.  He gains Martian Manhunter's psychic abilities and is trained by him. 

Who can he beat? </TEXT>

Round 1: Victory is earned by becoming recognized Queen of the Dinosaurs (to stick it to *real* Godzilla). 

Round 2: Victory is earned by not becoming Queen, but her species maintaining a presence on the island living alongside all the other dinosaurs (to pretend she has nothing to do with *real* Godzilla).

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Everyone, ever, is entered into the next Mortal Kombat tournament. After every round, the winner MUST perform their fatality. This is how they advance to the next round. They are judged in one of 3 categories: Disturbingness (How shocking it is to watch and how likely someone is to get PTSD from watching it), Violence (How excessive the force used is or how gorey the fatality is), and Awesomeness (How inventive the fatality is). I have both Disturbing and visceral because the most visceral one might not be the most disturbing. 

The judges for the PTSD category: A US marine, the ESRB (their decision counts as one of three votes), and your mother

The judges for the Visceral category: A janitor (judging how 
much he'll have to clean up), Sephiroth, and Walter White

The judges for the Replay category: A frat bro, TF2's Heavy, and the Boss (Saints Row)

Each judge gives a rating out of ten, and the contestant's score is the total of the three scores. Which character would take home the gold in each category and how would they do it? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> So the Arceus we see in the games isn't His true form, right? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-06-07 03:36:44 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Arceus is said to have created the universe with its "Ten Thousand Arms", despite having a significant lack of any arms whatsoever. Also, its base stat total is less than that of Mega-Mewtwos X and Y, which shouldn't be possible for a mortal when comparing itself to an Omnipotent. Speaking of which, Arceus can't even learn all the moves in the games. So, there's only one logical conclusion I can come to. The Arceus who appears before Lucas and Dawn in Diamond, Pearl, and Platinum, is not at His fully realized form. Similar to how the Judeo-Christian God appeared before Moses as a perpetually burning bush, Arceus limits His power before stepping into the world of mortals. Because the True Form is a abstract concept, and not necessarily equine, or even perceptible to the human mind. Like Cthulhu, perhaps Arceus exists in a higher dimension, and simply wqants to limit himself to a 3-dimensional form to keep from driving the Pokemon Master insane. 

That's my theory, anyway. What do you guys think? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Round 1: 4-way debate about something they know nothing about. 

Round 2: /u/Unidan and Bill Nye vs. Tyson and Mr. Rogers in a team rap battle. 

Round 3: all four have to separately convince Galactus not to consume Earth

Round 4: /u/Unidan and Mr. Rogers are counter-terrorist vs. Nye and Tyson as terrorists in a Counter-Strike (Source because why not). Best of five rounds. 

Round 5: everyone is leading their own equally powerful nation, each the size and wealth of the Cold War USA. Assuming Nye and Tyson don't know how to actually build a rocket, who wins the Space Race?

Round 6: Everyone gets their choice of a Buster Sword, dagger, or one- or two-handed axe. They are dropped into the Capital Wasteland from Fallout 3 one week before the Lone Wanderer escapes and must survive. The first person to find anything from the game can have it. Who lasts the longest? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Mewtwo is sentient like in the movie, with stats and moves from X and Y. He has a completely filled trainer's bag and has again kidnapped Nurse Joy, as well as a move re-learner. He has both Mega Stones, but can only carry one at a time. His Nurse and Move Tutor stay behind when he goes to fight, so if he wants to heal he has to leave and come back. His goal, using the creation trio to travel between universes, is to take all of them over by killing or recruiting (Mystery Dungeon style) all of their strongest fighters. For example, he has to kill every legendary pokemon who refuses to cooperate, every Godzilla monster, the entire Justice League, etc. Can he do it? If not, who stops him? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> (Pokemon) There are at least four different Mewtwos in the Pokemon world </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-03-21 20:10:02 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Mewtwo is encountered in three games, all at level 70: FireRed/LeafGreen, HeartGold/SoulSilver (We're assuming the remakes are canon because they're more recent) and X/Y. The Mewtwo in HGSS is rumored to be Red's Mewtwo after being released, but since HGSS takes place two years after FRLG, this can't be true because Mewtwo is still level 70. If it was released by Red, it would have leveled up by at least one at some point. Levels represent a pokemon's natural growth, with an older pokemon being a higher level due to its age rather than directly being linked to power. In the game, this manifests in levels, but for this theory we'll assume that level=age. This means that Mewtwo is the same age two years later, which can't be possible. Therefore, the Mewtwo as caught by Ethan and Lyra is a different Mewtwo from the one caught by Red and Leaf. Then there's the matter of Calem and Serena's Mewtwo, which is again level 70, and this time there's two in Kalos: Mewtwo X and Mewtwo Y, one for each Mega Stone. It's implied that X and Y take place around the same time as Red and Blue, because Blue was actually in Kalos and the one person who mentioned him doesn't mention that he's a champion or gym leader, meaning at that point he hadn't beaten the Pokemon League yet. This could also be when Sycamore got his hands on Kanto starters, but that's a different theory. So there's two Mewtwos in Kalos, and two in Kanto, albiet at different times. There's another theory stating that the Mewtwo in Kalos is in fact Red's, which ran away to live in secrecy, but it didn't age, so that's out of the question. Since the one Mewtwo we have canon information about, Red's, was the son of Mew, born on February 6, we can assume this means that the three other Mewtwos are also directly the children of Mews. Mewtwo is a mutation of the Mew DNA, meaning Mewtwo can't reproduce stably. The Kanto Mew probably gave birth to both Mewtwos which have inhabited Cerulean Cave (at different times), and the Kalos Mew probably had twin Mewtwos. This isn't even taking into account non-main series games like Mystery Dungeon or Ranger.  </TEXT>
