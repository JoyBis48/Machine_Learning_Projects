	<TEXT> A bunch of new concepts are being used for characters. I can't reveal too many of the changes this early, though.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey Dustination. Yeah, I came just to see what people wanted. The demo's likely to be out by July, though, so I'm getting some input in before we finalize it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I can't confirm anything for them yet. Do know that I plan on including SOMETHING related to Super Mario RPG in the game.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Items will definitely return, and later we may implement those other things into a online mode down the line.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It will definitely lean towards Melee, but with mechanics from SSB64/Brawl/SSB4. Veterans are definitely getting some updates to better fit their character or to help them in combat. For instance, a good example is Mario, who's recovery is being boosted and with a bit of extra power. This includes giving him a Ground Pound stall-then-fall dair, buffing the Super Jump Punch, and other things.  Many characters will receive changes to differ themselves from not only their console interpretations, but Project M and other fan game interpretations as well. It won't be Melee 2.0 or Brawl 2.0.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Veterans are the main focus currently, but there are quite a few newcomers that are being planned, mostly to fill certain fighting game archetypes and provide a unique Smash Bros. experience. The Balloon Fighter is the main character from one of Nintendo's original NES titles, Balloon Fight. He's recently been a trophy in Melee, had music in Brawl, was a featured game in Nintendo Land and is in the NES Remix games.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We're keeping it very low-key for the moment, when the demo comes out I'd definitely appreciate some assistance in patching it for problems. We're trying to make it the same core as Smash Bros. with the best mechanics from different installments, yet add enough new mechanics to differentiate it from any previous or upcoming Smash. It's likely the full version won't be out until after SSB4.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> -There aren't any OCs in this game. All veterans are hopefully going to be implemented into the game before the final version. 

-This game brings the best of each Smash game together, as well as introduce new things from other fighters and Nintendo games that wouldn't be in the upcoming SSB4. 

-Our coders and spriters do. I've worked a small amount, and do know a bit of coding, but I'm able to manage the team efficiently and help assist them if needed. 

-I'm trying my best to make this happen so that it's available on Mac, PC and Linux. It may take a while, though. 

-Affinity is a work in progress name, it's based off of a new mechanic we're implementing into the game, but I can't reveal it until we can definitely put it into the game.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have been thinking about that, and I'm planning on putting a lot of work into making sure animations are smooth and flow like a model would. This will likely give more of a cartoony feel to the game, but it fits the premise nicely. For instance, an attack to the face will actually affect the face, not just put them into a damage animation. Characters will react to their surroundings instead of just having inputs.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The problem is that, while P:M has great gameplay and SSF2 the pixel art, they both lack new Nintendo characters with moveset capability. This will be treated as a normal Smash game would: the characters from Nintendo's history and present fighting for supremacy, give or take a few rivals.  </TEXT>
