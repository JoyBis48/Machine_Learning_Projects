	<TEXT> I'm sorry, but did you even read the article? It clearly states that, and I quote, "Although ancient peoples probably did not realize that fingerprints could uniquely identify individuals,[51] references from the age of the Babylonian king Hammurabi (1792-1750 BCE) indicate that law officials would take the fingerprints of people who had been arrested.[52]" </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Tried to post in /r/gaming but it wouldn't show up and mods never replied to my message...

So I was cleaning the floors in our bedroom and pulling all of the shit out from under our bed and I find these beauties in a box covered in dust. Now, I've never been much of a gamer, but I loved these two systems! The Game Boy Color still works, however, the screen on the Game Gear is not working. I can hear sound and barely see an image if I hold screen at an angle. Can it be repaired cheaply and easily?

Also (sorry).... What is this? Can I connect the Game Gear to my TV or monitor?

	<TEXT> Ok, so about 7 years ago, I was working out pretty hard and supplementing Creatine. I was taking the capsules, which you are supposed to swallow with a LARGE glass of water. Well, one morning I was running late for work, after the gym, and I throw the capsules in my mouth and swallow them at the water fountain. About a mile down the road my throat starts drying up severely and then I cough... POOF... Creatine powder everywhere and it tastes like shit so I start gagging until I pull over, open the door, and puke...and puke...and puke. The Creatine powder coated my throat so bad I couldn't stop gagging.

Also, I took my glasses off in the process of puking and set them on my seat... I sat on them and broke them when I got back into the car.

TL;DR Creatine and then sat on my glasses, breaking them.  </TEXT>
