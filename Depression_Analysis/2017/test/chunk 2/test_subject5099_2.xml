	<TEXT> DO NOT EVER PLAY THIS GUYS GAMES...
Even for his first game, this is wildly unacceptable, he did not pregen or cut off the whitelist, leading to 30 minutes of trying to kick people to lower the player count. Then, the game was changed to FFA due to issues, (which is fine), however, then the host made himself "a walking pinata" with a sharp V sword and full diamond. I said that this was F-ing Stupid, and to that, he said, that this was a "random game" when infact it was a Reddit To2, not an FFA by some nitwit, even though thats what it ended up being. Do not play in this hosts games, unless you want to waste your time. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Practice your pvp overall, and start with an FFA, learn the basics, maybe some tactics, and listen to what some people say in chat, because while sometimes it is really annoying things that arent relevant, sometimes it is helpful. Keep the mentality too at the start of the game, that you will only have 10 hearts, and thats it.

And remember, baby zombies will eat your face, skellies have aimbot, and that the nether is over-powered. </TEXT>

When anyone would say anything about this, he would reply "quit yo bitchin" completely disregarding anything said. Do not play a game from this host if you wish to pvp, and not hide in caves from an event we were not notified of. </TEXT>
