Knowing the church's stance on birth control for it's contraceptive purpose, how does it feel if being used to treat a medical issue (e.g., regulate periods)?

Thanks in advance! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am an electrical designer for an electrical engineer. We do consulting engineering, and are mostly hired by architects to design the electrical portions of projects (e.g., lighting, power, mechanical connections, special systems, etc.)

I was offered a job by my potential parents-in-law. I started off answering phones, and making deliveries. I moved up to simply drafting other people's mark-ups. Now I do the design on my own.

I have no EE degree nor PE stamp, but I could go back in the future to obtain them if I wish. </TEXT>

And I hate it when after making a generalized statement, people immediately come back and say "not all of them are....".  Yeah--no crap, there isn't a single thing in the world that is 100% the same across the board.

/u/promisejustcurious is simply stating that in the are where they work, black people seem to be disrespectful of people's time, money, and service.   </TEXT>
