	<TEXT> This ^,  and if you like double flares and not the hassle of getting them in I'd recommend trying different materials like silicone and getting df plugs in any other material that have less of a flare... Some can certainly have even more than a mm flare and even that much at 2g would be near impossible... For anyone with tight skin. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Even using a leave in spray conditioner should solve this issue as well as brushing more regularly...Also, any shampoo with lots of chemicals(so drugstore or even professional stuff) makes my hair smoother, straighter, and even thinner so I'd say that and leave in...


Also maybe consider how much you're washing your hair and adjust if its less than every day or every other day! </TEXT>
