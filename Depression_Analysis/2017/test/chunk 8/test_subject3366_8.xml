	<TEXT> For the record, the reason some dates aren't changing to the "d-mmm-yy" format you have set in the date columns is because they're before 1 Jan 1900, which is where Excel starts counting dates (1/1/1900 = 1), so dates prior to that are text strings, not numbers. To change the formatting on the dates after 1/1/00, highlight the column, right click  Format Cells. On the Numbers tab in Category, select Custom. In the Type field, enter *d mmmm yyyy*.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We cannot be sure exactly what Anglo-Saxon children would have worn, but we can make a guess based on objects found in graves, from drawings in Anglo-Saxon books and images on objects.

It appears that Anglo-Saxon children wore clothes similar to the adults. Boys would wear trousers with a tunic and a belt at the waist, like men. Girls may have just worn a long tunic dress but some girls also appear to have worn the over-dress held together with a pair of brooches at the shoulders and a belt at the waist. Children would also have worn leather shoes. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Our Rules were adopted in consultation with our subscribers, we don't change them lightly. Paywalls aren't an issue that comes up much, but I've initiated a mod thread to discuss. Agreed, they're a pain. There are other non-paywalled sites running the story, or you can google the title and get unpaywalled WSJ article from search links, but I'm leaving this post as it's not against current rules, and at the least will make people look it up if they want to read more. But yes, annoying. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Tolkien was born in Bloemfontein in the Orange Free State, at that time (1892) an independent Boer Republic. It became part of the Union of South Africa after the Boer War. Tolkien had little conscious memory of South Africa. His father had only taken the assignment in Bloemfontein because the English bank for which he worked had promised him a promotion for going there. Certainly Tolkien never considered himself to be a South African, just an Englishman who happened to be born in South Africa. He never returned. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you do do this, set it up with the opening facing west. White outs most commonly sweep through east to west, and you don't want to end up a giant dustpan. Something to lower and secure on the open side when the wind kicks up, but also the ability to loosen the walls cloth/canvas/plastic/whatever on all sides if the structure is in danger of shifting if the wind gets too crazy. You'll fill up with dust, but better than the collapse of the structure. No matter how secure it looks, you are still basically a sail, and when the wind is beyond the capability of a ship to handle, you retract them. And as stated, rebar rebar rebar! </TEXT>
