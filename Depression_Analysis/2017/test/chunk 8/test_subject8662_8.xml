	<TEXT> The only thing you can do is be there for him when he asks, and maintain cautious distance when he doesn't.

Edit: Unintentional Creepiness aside, i definitely understand, and I'm not saying wait for that perfect moment with fireworks and white wine and all that Hollywood nonsense, just best not to rush into anything you'll later regret. I've had some close calls where I damn near broke rule #1, and it would have been bad.  </TEXT>
