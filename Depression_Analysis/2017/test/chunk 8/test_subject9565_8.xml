	<TEXT> Thank you so much and thank you. Good luck and you are in the right field because your field will always be needed! It sucks that people do not have patience when I ask them to repeat something but hey I do hope one day people become more aware because its sad when people think deaf and hearing impaired are the same thing!  </TEXT>

My favourite part of pitch perfect when there was a scene where this club Deaf Jews appeared. Since then, I joke i'm in the back. I learned sense of humour gets you through it.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Struggles of being hearing impaired </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-09-01 04:17:35 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I've been hearing impaired for all my life and I wear two hearing aids. Yes, I'm very lucky to be able to get the care I need, but there are several struggles that I face everyday that many do not. Having a sense of humour helps me through this. I joke when my friends didn't hear me (shocking right) I say that my hearing loss is spreading onto them lol. I also joke that I'm the extra in pitch perfect in the deaf jew scene. I no longer have to worry about what to dress up as for halloween. I just need to be myself!

1- I had a professor refuse to repeat what he said in the lecture (no power points) even though the week before I told him I was hearing impaired. He said if I didnt keep on raising my hand I would of heard it. 

2- People tell me that I talk to loud and a recent incident happened when I was sitting outside with friends at Starbucks and someone told me to lower my voice. I can't hear how loud I am and people do not understand that it's not my fault.

3- People think I'm deaf and it's sad that people do not know the difference between hearing impaired and deaf.

4- In loud places, I have a hard time hearing conversations 

5- People ask the same questions- can you sleep with them, can you shower/swim with them, if you take them off can you hear, can you read lips/can you read mine, can you get electrocuted? (yes someone asked that) 

6- A few years ago, I worked at a day camp. A kid wanted my attention and I talked to her then I went back to listening to the others when I heard people laughing. My co-workers were laughing at me because the kid wanted my attention again and I didn't hear. I hated working there.

I made this post because I believe people need to be more aware of hearing impairement and deaf. So the next time you hear someone talk loud think before you speak. They may wear hearing aids.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Gay and Vegan are two completely different things. Vegan is a choice of a lifestyle the person has made and it has to do with food. Where gay is a sexuality and has to do with being attracted to same sex. Being gay is more accepted now than in the past but its still not a 100%. Where as Vegan is being healthy since now its the new thing to be skinny and be healthy. Some people on the internet are stupid. I would be all over that shit.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have depression, and I went through a very difficult time from Nov-March. My dad cancer spread and after hearing so many good things it crushed me knowing that the treatment didn't work. When my sister told me she was engaged a week after I didn't feel anything. That's when I started to notice things were not so good. Suicidal thoughts began and I would always think about my funeral. Once I finally opened up to my therapist and my friends/family about it. I feel a lot better knowing that I'm not fighting it by myself. Yes it was hard to open up, but now I don't feel ashamed and I do not feel alone. I love movies, I watch movies all the time and it allows me to look forward to things ahead. I still have depression but I feel a lot better than I did before. I accepted what I had and I'm not letting it stop me. I always have a laugh about life because it makes things better when things are funny!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So I was really lucky and I got to attend the first advance screening in Toronto for Zach Braff second movie Wish I Was Here that he directed, produced, written and acted in. I also got to meet him in this fancy room with fancy drinks and food for all FREE! This girl on twitter couldn't go so she gave them to me! The movie was good, 3/5 stars! The soundtrack was good as well! 

Fun fact: Steve Spielberg is in the credits for helping making the movie happening.  </TEXT>
