	<TEXT> It's delicious! I have to admit... The only sujuk I've had is the one I've made at home. 

The jist of it is it's a basic beef blend with red wine, garlic, paprika, etc but I think the flavor you're referring to is fenugreek! It's super yummy and is that X factor is sausages usually. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> it's all good! sausage casings do usually come from intestines which is why they have that shape so you weren't wrong

	<TEXT> Sausage making is 2 basic steps: meat grinding + casing!

To make this recipe, I ground a blend of short rib and round meat to get a 70/30 fat ratio.

Using some hog casings I bought online, I then stretched the casings over my kitckenaid sausage stuffer attachment and then stuffed the blended meat in there! </TEXT>
