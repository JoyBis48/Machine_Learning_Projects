	<TEXT> I was waiting to board a plane when I noticed a guy wearing a great t-shirt. It was a drawing of a classic nintendo, and under it "You always remember your first". Loved the shirt. Got on the plane, took off, and the stewardesses were serving drinks. A woman one row up got coffee. The stewardess spilled the coffee on the woman's baby, who immediately began shrieking. Meanwhile my kid had just fallen asleep, double concern for the burned baby and now my kid, who might actually SLEEP through a plane ride, is going to wake up screaming too. They asked whether anyone on the plane was a doctor and the nintendo t-shirt guy was a pediatrician.

	<TEXT> I have a great idea for an invention to stop this from happening. I emailed and wrote about it to people and heard nothing back. How can someone get a safety invention picked up? Not an inventor by trade so no fucking clue what to do with it, but as a mom I am ill every time I see a story like this. That mom's life is over. So much grief.
