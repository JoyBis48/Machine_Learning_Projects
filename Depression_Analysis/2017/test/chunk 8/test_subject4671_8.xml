	<TEXT> I'll try my best but this question as a whole is better answered by a guy like monte cristo. Lets start as the buffs are getting stolen. c9 has 2 options, contest with multiple players(putting each lane at a disadvantage) or letting them take them. Nasus then goes immediately to the 2v1 lane bc jungle nasus takes spirit fire first allowing easier wave clear for an even faster tower. As soon as C9 takes first tower the have map control and can dictate the pace of the game. C9 switches their duo back to bot to prevent dig from taking a fast tower and to keep pressure on dragon.

C9 keeps pressure on lane and slowly push all lanes. The slight lull in action we saw during mid game is bc jayce becomes a monster in team fights around the 18 min mark or whenever muramana is complete.

support takes oracles earlier and often to keep map control and allow for more psuhing. this is standard korean play </TEXT>
