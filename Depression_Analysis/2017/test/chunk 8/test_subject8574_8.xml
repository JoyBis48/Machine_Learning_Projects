	<TEXT> Yes, they have. They questioned all staff who worked at the school, and unfortunately they never saw or heard anything about Jon from my son. Hell, I even went as far as to talk personally with both Keith and Mark. They had no idea that my son was friends with a man named Jon. I tried to find as much info as I could, but the frustration came when I had literally nothing to go on as to find his whereabouts. But trust me when I say I will find the bastard. I don't think even God would forgive the things I would do to that man once I have my hands around his throat.     </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My friend, in this life we are given cards on the table that, at the time, can overwhelm us and even give us a true fear. Sometimes our guilt lingers beyond being able to comprehend what we have done or could have done. As with my son, I can tell by your comment that you loved your mother, and I have no doubt she loved you. Pressing on and doing our best to help others, including ourselves, is the best we can do in the end. I hope wherever your road leads you, it will lead you well. Not because you followed it, but because you chose too. I wish you luck my good friend. Never give in, and never give up. </TEXT>
