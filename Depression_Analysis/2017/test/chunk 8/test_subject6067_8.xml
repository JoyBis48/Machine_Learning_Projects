	<TEXT> Hi!  My insurance is offering full body CT scans and a few of my coworkers have had it done.  I'm wondering if these scans are safe and how accurate they really are.  I really don't want extra radiation if it's not necessary.  What do you guys think?

	<TEXT>  Hi Fanky1356, I'm guessing that you're 17 and you really have a long time ahead of you to figure out stuff like that.  Only through more life experience will you then figure out who you really are.  I'm in my early 30's and I still surprise myself.  Try to enjoy your life and do as much traveling as you possibly can :) </TEXT>
