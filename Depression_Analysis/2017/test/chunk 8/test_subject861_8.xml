Acts 16:30-31 - He then brought them out and asked, Sirs, what must I do to be saved? They replied, Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved."

John 3:3 - Jesus replied, Very truly I tell you, no one can see the kingdom of God unless they are born again. </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2014-09-16 00:25:35 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> *Cross-posted. Wanting some more input.* 

I built a PC back in 2012 with some decent parts at the time. The computer still works fine, but I want to be proactive in updating my PC before it becomes a problem. I've listed my current specs below.

Can you help me figure out what I need to prioritize in this upgrading process (assuming that I cannot afford every upgrade at once)? Which current pieces need to be replaced soonest? What should they be replaced with? Etc.

(Not wanting to spend absurd amounts of money for the upgrades. Under $500 or so total. PC used mainly for gaming and browsing.)

* My wife and I regularly game together. We want to be able to continue playing the best story-driven action games (Bioshock Infinite, Assassin Creeds, Tomb Raider, The Walking Dead, Paper's Please (lol). It is also used day-to-day for web browsing and paper writing.

**What is your maximum budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?** 

* I am a conservative spender. I'm looking biggest bang for my buck and I'm buying piece by piece. Any and all upgrades would need to total less than $500. Can be flexible.

**When do you plan on building/buying the PC?** 

* By the end of the year I would like to have a few pieces replaced for longer durability and better quality. </TEXT>
