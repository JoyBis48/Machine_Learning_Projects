	<TEXT> All racing tyres will have that problem if you abuse them. locking up the tyres will have a detrimental effect, no matter which racing series as it introduces flat spots. It also will always cost you time. Hence it's better to have a smoother, cleaner driver, rather than balsy, locking up everywhere. Sure it looks much faster but in reality it will always be slower </TEXT>

	<TEXT> To be honest, I only caught the last 5 hours of WEC last weekend and seeing a Porsche so far in front, it was like watching F1

What annoys me tho was the commentary

"**More people are now switching from F1, because of factors such as sound**"

But most of the Diesel LMP1 car was totally SILENT, and usually the ones with the awesome sounds were from the GT class.

"**More and more F1 drivers seem to be coming to WEC**"

But that had been always the case. 

"**WEC provides wheel to wheel actions!**"

From what I understood that only happened up til nighttime, where the Porsche pulled a lead, and most of the overtaking after that happens in the pits

	<TEXT> Lots of reason

- Weather. The FIA need to make sure the race avoid the most extreme weather that the hosting country could achieve. This could be the Monsoon in Malaysia or the extreme summer in other places

- Tradition. Some races are traditionally in that date. For example Monaco is always near the end of May, and would usually be at the same weekend as the Indy 500. Canada would always follow it next, and then LeMans. If they can help it, they would usually make it that way. I think Brundle was saying that the FIA would usually assign the Monaco GP's date for the year, and work out the rest of the races from there.

- Host circuit calendar. They also need to see if the host circuit will have a free slot. Can't really plonk the race in a weekend where the host circuit has already agreed to do another race can we? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Cena was supposed to face Rock at Wrestlemania. CM Punk challenged Cena, if Cena lost, CM Punk will get that shot instead.

So we have a PPV Tier match between CM Punk and Cena on fucking RAW. It was so good because they busted out moves that they would never do. Punk with a piledriver and Cena with a hurracarana (kinda botched but that's beside the point). 

It was awesome because storytelling wise, they both want to win, and they are digging deep using moves that one would never imagine them to do

	<TEXT> Gotta disagree. I live in Asia, which is quite far away from US as you can get, but during AE, most of the males in the schools watches wrestling. Heck, majority of the grown up does as well. And at the time we did not even get RAW on free to air TV (only Superstars that have RAW recaps, RAW was on cable) but that did not stop kids from emulating The Rock, Stone Cold or Undertaker. 

What's more amazing was WCW was virtually non existent, even tho they were as large as WWF at the time. This is due to WWF's reaching out to oversea countries knowing that they would get more money while WCW which was bankrolled by Turner decided that they don't need outside exposure. And even without the Monday Night Wars, WWF still manage to gain mainstream appeal in my country.

The day I knew about the Monday Night War and WCW was when they were showing the episode of the Radicalz debuting on RAW, and a local newspaper that had a wrestling column suddenly talked about that defection </TEXT>

IMO the current live timing on the browser is good because not only it works for desktop browsers, but it also works for phone browsers as well

2 - The Live Commentary tab also has radio messages, some which are not even shown on the telecast

3 - Depending on who shows F1 in your country, they would also carry additional channels. For example, Fox Sports in Asia has a dedicated Onboard, Pit Lane and Track Map for each race that is accessible from their website </TEXT>

"A fan hit Goldberg with a cardboard Star of David" - The Wrestling Observer Newsletter: October 16, 2000 

Took me a while to remember that Goldberg is a Jew and this is ironic


Quote #160 

"Chris Jericho's final WCW match was 7/21 in Peoria, IL in a tag match teaming with Eddie against Kidman and Mysterio. Before the match, Jericho said that if he got pinned he'd leave WCW. Misterio than said everyone already knew it was his last night in WCW. (After the match) all four hugged in the ring. There were fans in near tears, as was Jericho. Kidman started a Jericho chant. Jericho said that he was overwhelmed by the response, but he still thinks that Peoria sucks" - The Wrestling Observer Newsletter: August 02, 1999

	<TEXT> Hi Alex, 

First off, how different is driving an F1 car compared to a LeMans/endurance car?

Does it effect how you approach race? How do you pace yourself?

And how is it racing in a car shared with someone else? Does some leeway has to be taken when either drivers have a disagreement?

Thank you </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Those games that were based on the original Gmotor/gmotor2 engine (rFactor, GTR, GTR2, GT legends, rFactor2, Shift, Shift2, etc) has an easy way to know where to brake when you turn off the racing line. Look for the darker patch of tarmac on the road. That's your braking point.

In any cases the patch is similar to the other color of the road, start braking where the rumble strip starts </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is the logical step for Kunos. The success of Project Cars must have something to do with this decision. I'm actually happy as this means that the PC version will also have more contents. 

IMO though, the console and the PC version will not be quite similar. Modding would certainly be a PC version only. Most likely the console version will be a separate game altogether? 

ISI did this with the F1 Challenge game, where the playstation version differs highly from the PC version </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Indeed. But when it leads to a better overall experience I don't see a problem. With ABS and TC on, a player would more likely to do the "Dive on the inside move" knowing that they would stop in time without thinking of the other car

Without both assist, one need to think where to brake without locking up, and when to throttle out without spinning, hence anyone that wants to stay on the black stuffs tends to be more diciplined </TEXT>
