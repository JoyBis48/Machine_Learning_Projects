	<TEXT> After going to the Darlington race this past weekend, my friends and I started wondering if there was a difference between the 2 designations for a track.  Most of the tracks NASCAR goes to are noted as Speedways, but there are a few that are Raceways.  Or is it whatever the hell the track owner feels like calling it when they name it? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Agreeing with pretty much everyone else that this Chase format is a terrible idea.  But aside from the top 4 drivers going for the championship, are the remaining 12 that were eliminated from the chase essentially finishing in points in relation to where they are to the other 11 eliminated drivers at the Homestead race?  It says when someone is eliminated their total is reset to 2,000.  So does someone eliminated in the first round have their points reset to 2,000 after every 3rd chase race?  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Scoring for rookie of the year question. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-11-05 19:20:16 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I know the scoring for rookie of the year is based entirely different from the points received for the championship.  The highest finishing rookie receives 10 points, second 9, then 8, etc.  On top of this there are points for attempting to qualify, getting a top 10, and a few other things.  Along with this, only the 17 top finishes per rookie are considered for their points.  My question is, out of those 17 finishes that are taken into account, how is a rookies points calculated if that race was a top 17 finish for them, but wasn't a top 17 for any other rookie?  Here's hypothetical example with Ricky and Danica.  Ricky gets 23rd place and Danica gets 25th.  Ricky has 17 other finishes higher than this race so this isn't taken into account for his rookie score.  But for Danica it is one of her top 17 finishes of the year.  Does this then only count for 9 points for Danica?  Of course with only 2 drivers it's not a big difference, but when there's a larger rookie field it would have more of an impact. </TEXT>
