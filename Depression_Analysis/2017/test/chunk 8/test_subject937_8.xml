Edit: Downvote if you'd like but your argument is flawed. Since 1964, you cannot deny service to someone based on various criteria (e.g., race, religion).

	<TEXT> Under federal law, private businesses that are open to the public cannot discriminate based on certain criteria (e.g., race, sex, religion).

That is also why those who claim this isn't aimed at LGBTs are full of shit. Sexual orientation and gender identity DO NOT make the list mentioned above (but should). Therefore, the standard protected classes will not be affected by this law because the Civil Rights Act of 1964 trumps state law. This leaves one obvious gap: LGBTs. </TEXT>

Requiring handwritten, personally-researched letters to our representatives is an excellent way to keep them free from voter input.

Why not let a trusted group do the grunt work? I support this practice (perhaps more so than the alternative because it allows average people to send meaningful input - it's no longer something only for the wealthy or extremely dedicated). </TEXT>

Switching the terms will literally change nothing and just appeases opponents of marriage equality. </TEXT>

Your solution would just require every law book to swap "marriage" with "civil union", which is a waste of time and money for literally no change (except for appeasement of homophobes). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There are lot of legitimate issues with this bill. However, does anyone really think that a judge is going to allow a state RFRA as a defense for wife beating? To refuse Jews lodging in a hotel? Refuse interracial couples?

You left out one group that does not have federal protections (from legislation such as this): homosexuals. Is the possibility of a judge ruling against a homosexual as absurd as you think your other examples are?

Overall, religious freedom is protected by the First Amendment. I don't see what lack of religious freedom this bill is trying to address. It's just hard to believe the uptick in this sort of legislation has _nothing_ to do with the pending marriage lawsuit in the SCOTUS. Doesn't pass the smell test. </TEXT>

You originally quite clearly said that executive agreements cannot have the force of federal law (i.e., "No. They. Do. Not"). I provided specific case law from the Supreme Court showing that you are wrong.

You're trying to back peddle now by saying "most" have congressional input. That wasn't your original claim at all.

You're also now admitting you're not an expert, which I take to mean you have no legal training. I do, including studying international law in the U.S. and abroad. You're understanding of the law here is simply wrong.

	<TEXT> That is a definitional argument. Big "t" Treaties are pursuant to the Treaty Cause; small "t" treaties aren't. That is the only meaningful difference.

International law makes no distinction between the two; only U.S. law does. A U.S. President signing a sole executive agreement pursuant to his authority as C-in-C is no less a treaty than one ratified by the Senate.

And, by the way, a statute is only as good so long as the sitting Congress wishes it to be (generally). It is no surprise that lawmaking is dependent upon lawmakers. </TEXT>

It's been about a decade since I took International Law but [here's](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t source=web rct=j ei=IlMCVbWoBc32gwTy6IPwBw url=http://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RL32528.pdf ved=0CDAQFjAG usg=AFQjCNE_0ryx2ClehZ7q_isyd4Gx6BWBxA sig2=sgtAFQ3TkUwDbnEX478lCw) [PDF download] a good resource I found that should blunt your certainty.

That is a congressional report with case citations, not an ehow page. There are sections that address each of your points, I think.

Edit: Here's the footnote refuting your claim that sole executive agreements cannot have the force of federal law (in italics):

Executive agreements have been held to be inferior to conflicting federal law when the agreement concerns matters 
expressly within the constitutional authority of Congress. See, e.g., United States v. Guy W. Capps, Inc., 204 F.2d 655 
(4th Cir. 1953) (finding that executive agreement contravening provisions of import statute was unenforceable); 
RESTATEMENT, supra footnote 1, 115 reporters n.5. *However, an executive agreement may trump pre-existing federal law if it concerns an enumerated or inherent executive power under the Constitution, or if Congress has historically 
acquiesced to the President entering agreements in the relevant area.* See Pink, 315 U.S. at 230 ([a]ll Constitutional 
acts of power, whether in the executive or in the judicial department, have as much legal validity and obligation as if 
they proceeded from the legislature) (quoting The Federalist No. 64 (John Jay)); Dames   Moore, 453 U.S. at 654 
(upholding sole executive agreement concerning the handling of Iranian assets in the United States, despite the 
existence of a potentially conflicting statute, given Congresss historical acquiescence to these types of agreements).

In other words, if it is a constitutional prerogative of the President, his signature alone can be binding. And you don't get much more Presidential than foreign policy. </TEXT>
