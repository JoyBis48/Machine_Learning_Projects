	<TEXT> This happened to me once. I was working with a piece that started with 150 ch, so it was pretty big. I didn't want to tear my work out, so I ended up single crocheting down the side that had the dropped stitch(es) and back. It looked like a repair, but I was glad to have a fix that didn't require undoing 8 hours of work.  </TEXT>
