	<TEXT> As a basketball addict, law school graduate, media researcher, and writer, Silver could confidently rely on me as a dynamic, creative, collaborative, hard-driving member of the league office.  I would take great pride in researching international digital television rights for live broadcasts, forecasting changes in social media demographics, writing speeches for Silver's appearances with non-profit charities, brainstorming novel approaches to preserving the game's competitive integrity, and getting his dry cleaning if need be.  Whatever needs to be done thoroughly, correctly, and thoughtfully.

I would always remind myself that the NBA is no where without the fans, as the game obviously existed before the creation of the league. The game is as important to the high rollers who take private jets to away games on a whim and have lavish arena suites as it is to the single parent who saves up just enough each year to drive four hours both ways to take their children to a home game, sit in the nosebleeds, and savor every moment as their family cheers on their team.

Silver and previous commissioners have been from New York, Connecticut, or Massachusetts, but hopefully they'd let a hard-working Midwesterner join in the fun.  The NBA is truly unique entertainment, a growing (and complicated) business, an aspirational calling, and has a storied, memorable, highlight-filled past.  I want to be a part of its storied, memorable, highlight-filled future, all while contributing to the continued success of the league I've loved since I first picked up a basketball.

See...  Completely serious.  :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So you can be a Browns fan and say Johnny Manziel (QB), then others with reply to you with offers from their own team.  Perhaps there will be counter offers or 3-way trades that require representation from other franchises?

Who knows.


You can trade multiple players, draft picks, coaches, mascots, whatever.  Just will be interesting to see what we think assets are worth.


Keep in mind, if you're including players/assets that others might not know too much about, please provide information about them (position, years in league, stats, highlight reel)


Have fun!
