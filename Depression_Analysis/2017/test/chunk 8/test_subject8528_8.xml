EDIT: They also revamped the graphics and replaced some of the characters. [The Wikipedia entry about it goes into more detail.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperdimension_Neptunia_%28video_game%29#Hyperdimension_Neptunia_Re.3BBirth_1) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Depends on a number of things:

* Number of hunts fought in,

* Looted gear

* Raids/Dungeons run 

* First time bonus in raids/dungeons

* Progress on Relic weapon

* etc...

Thankfully, the game doesn't require an instantaneous jump from i50 to i90 as the 3 main raids (LOTA, ST, WoD) are (i50, i70, i90 respectively)

I'd say about 20-30 hours of gameplay. (Maybe more, maybe less, depends on the amount of grind you want to do within a period of time.) </TEXT>

	<TITLE> How can I stop FFV from the FF:Anthology for PS1 from crashing on saving? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-05-23 04:55:21 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I managed to find a copy of the Final Fantasy: Anthology for PS1 today at a local store but much to my detriment, FFV seems to crash 50-75% of the time when saving which will make it difficult or impossible to progress.

What can I do to fix it? I've tried turning off smoothing and such to no avail.

I was able to save once, but other than that it will always go to a black screen when saving. 

---

If there isn't a fix, I guess I could hook my up my old PS2 and play it that way. My concern is that with how most TVs are forgoing the composite/component connectors it would be a stop gap for about a decade or so and the FF series is something I'd like to keep around for longer than that. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The hard part about LovePlus is that it was never, officially, brought over to the US and it is put away as a niche within the niche of visual novels. 

It is only available in English through a patch that someone put out years ago. 

You may want to look at the visual novel community as a whole as it is starting to gain ground in the western markets.

Some examples: 

* [The release of the first Grisaia game on Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/app/345610/)

* [The crowdfunding initiative to bring over Clannad in English.](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/sekaiproject/clannad-official-english-release/description)

* Popularity of indie game such as "Long Live the Queen" or the reception of the free visual novel, "Katawa Shoujo". </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I was watching episode 7 of MuvLuv Alternative: Total Eclipse and in one of the latter scenes the Lieutenant has a bath robe on but it is being worn [*right over left*](https://i.imgur.com/fsOmr8j.jpg).

I didn't know, or pay attention to this, but in Japan all robes whether they are kimonos, yutakas, bath robes, etc are all supposed to be worn *left over right* as the reverse is only used in funerals. This is so ingrained in the culture that during my class trip last year to Japan during the initial orientation about the yutaka and such they specified strict adherence to this.

You'd think with her being a stickler, in the same episode, about being Japanese that she'd keep to the conventions over her own culture.

Does anyone have an explanation for this or was it just a minor detail that an animator got wrong and it failed to be corrected for the blurays? </TEXT>
