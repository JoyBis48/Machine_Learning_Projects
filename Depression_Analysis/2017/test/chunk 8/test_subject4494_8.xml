I'm sure a lot of private schools *do* want the money.

And seriously, "Taking state money makes you accountable to the state and all of its standards and curriculum and bureaucracy etc"? As far as I know, schools need to be accredited anyway, regardless of if they take funds. (Although that might be different for different states, not sure about that.) </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  You need exactly one random number per spin (or you can use a single random number to seed a PRNG if you need a few more, but you don't ever really need very many for this sort of game). So, what you do is have a counter that you are incrementing very quickly (on a modern processor, billions of times a second) and then simply use whatever's in the counter when the user spins. It is impossible for the user to predict or control the counter since it's going so much faster than human reaction time.

If you do that, your effective entropy is however many times you can increment in a human's reaction time\*. [This source](https://www.ethicalhacker.net/features/book-reviews/mitnick-the-art-of-intrusion-ch-1-hacking-the-casinos-for-a-million-bucks) puts the time for a skilled person at five milliseconds. Assuming 1 billion possibilities per second, and a human capable of hitting a target within five milliseconds, the number of possibilities is 5 million, or around 22 bits of entropy. There are 311,875,200 possibilities for 5 cards out of 52 in order, so knowing that is certainly enough to determine what the seed is. Even with a slightly lower reaction time, you could still do it. Slot machines may have less bits leakage, though.

\*reaction time isn't really the right word here, you're aiming the first few times just to know what time you pressed it, and the time when you actually press something you may want to press it at a specific time. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The statement I took issue with was

 Not sure if it uses entropy at all.

in the context of someone using the lack of entropy to beat the program. My statement right before that was:

If you are generating it locally, there might be a limit on how much entropy is available, which would mean you could get a lot of data and then analyse it to get the algorithm.

So the way I used entropy there was including anything that could be analysed, which includes pre-programmed "entropy".

Given that I introduced the word into the discussion, did in fact use the standard definition, and the reply used the same word but using a different definition (according to you), I don't see what's wrong with my pointing out above that their statement makes no sense with the words it used. If they want to clarify, they can do so. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  When people speak of introducing "entropy" into a program they pretty much never mean accessing pseudo-randomness that was present in the system in it's initial state. They mean getting hardware-based entropy in real-time.

Well they should specify if they are using a non-standard definition. Preselected entropy has its own problems (in particular it may be leaked), but that doesn't mean it doesn't count as entropy. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> (I'm assuming every number is a bit, for simplicity.)

It will still take you N/M completely unpredictable interactions to start getting information you can make sense of.

That is equivalent to saying that your system uses at least N bits of entropy (perhaps minus a small constant). If your system uses less, say Y, then after observing YN bits, I can already start predicting. It might take a handful of more bits just to confirm, but your statement can't be true unless you come pretty close to N bits of entropy. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  When he says "unpredictable one from the next" he is probably referring to unpredictability for the end user given the information exposed to them, not completely unpredictable knowing everything there is to know about the system state. You don't need any entropy for the former whereas you certainly need entropy for the latter.

The information exposed to them is exactly however many bits they're willing to pay for. If we assume each play gives you 4 or so bits, then 100 plays gives you 400 and won't cost too much, and if you don't have at least 400 bits of entropy to work with, those 400 bits will probably yield useful info.

If you have *no* entropy, then anyone playing a couple games can already analyse it. See my sibling comment for a bunch of examples of this. </TEXT>

Uh, that requires entropy. In fact, if it's completely unpredictable, it's got to have as much entropy as the number of bits used.

	<TEXT>  Well, it uses a random number generator, and when you press 'spin' it has a x% chance of picking the low reelband and a y% chance of picking the high reelband, where x and y are chosen so that overall the payout is, say, 83% (or whatever).

I pretty much figured that from what you said previously.

There's no way to predict what the random number generator will decide. Some jurisdictions require an externally-approved generator, some even require the random numbers to come from an external server. But there is no way to predict what a slot machine is going to give you without nefarious and probably illegal means.

I've seen too many stories about profits from reverse-engineering RNGs to assume that there isn't a way. If you are generating it locally, there might be a limit on how much entropy is available, which would mean you could get a lot of data and then analyse it to get the algorithm. </TEXT>

Which test did you get that number from? Is it a well-validated test? Or just some random test online that spits out meaningless numbers?

The SAT measures achievement, so you can get a very high score by studying. An IQ test measures aptitude.

There's a suspiciously high correlation between the two. See http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2014/04/what_do_sat_and_iq_tests_measure_general_intelligence_predicts_school_and.html

	<TEXT> Most people that think they're really smart are not. I'd expect some evidence (Ivy League degree, founded large company, invented something complicated, etc) first. Considering you admit you aren't making that much compared to your less gifted husband, maybe you should reconsider why you think you're so smart.

For the record, .5 top IQ isn't even that smart. I got a 1600 Math/Reading SAT, which corresponds to around 1/1000, or top .1%.

Anyway, chess is mostly practice, at least at higher levels. Chess masters don't do better on non-chess related problems, it's just that spending 30,000 hours on anything while not being a complete idiot (say bottom 25-50% IQ or so) makes you pretty good. </TEXT>

The South seceded because they *thought* Lincoln was going to free the slaves, among other reasons. That doesn't make it the main issue in the war if the North was fighting for a different reason.

I guess my main problem is with people who think the North was fighting in order to free the slaves, or that slavery was the sole reason for the South. </TEXT>

Edit: my claim is that it wasn't completely, or (arguably) mostly, about slavery. IIRC Lincoln was ready to let the south keep their slaves at one point if it would stop the war. 

It was definitely part of it, though, just not a large a part as many might think. </TEXT>

From http://abcnews.go.com/Business/top-reasons-young-adults-sign-affordable-care-act/story?id=22690267:

Prior to the ACA, older and/or unhealthy adults could be charged more than five times what young, healthy adults were for health insurance premiums. The ACA limits this "age-rating" ratio to threethat is, older or unhealthy individuals can be charged only up to three times what the young and healthy pay.

So if I'm a fifth as risky as a high-risk person, I still need to pay a third of what they pay, which means I'm overpaying. The ACA outlawed charging based on risk for more than a 1:3 ratio. Yes, that was invented by the ACA. </TEXT>

You should pay the same amount as anyone else with the same expected cost, and those should balance out for the insurance company; but if I'm low risk, why should I pay more because insurance companies aren't allowed to charge more to high-risk people? They can only charge the highest risk people at most 3 times of the lowest risk people, regardless of how large the difference in risk may be. </TEXT>

In this particular city, you have two options: you can take the local train, which is cheap, or you can take the express train, which is more expensive but which will save you a full hour of travel time.

The most work chain will always win and the miners will prove they are more powerful than the subreddit, the developers, full node operators, merchants and the exchanges combined. None of the other groups will ever be able to challenge the most work chain, in my view.

It's more complicated than that; even if 95% of miners change, since this is a hard-fork, no exchanges or nodes can be forced onto the new chain. If 95% of miners *don't* change, they can stop the fork assuming it's backwards-compatible with old blocks, but not in reverse. </TEXT>
