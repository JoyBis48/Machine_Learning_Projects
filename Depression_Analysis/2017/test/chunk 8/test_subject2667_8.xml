	<TEXT>   I feel the most useful public discourse would challenge Geller to organize an event that lampooned both Jesus and Muhammed.

Muslims are also forbidden from depicting Jesus, or any other prophet of God. So Muslims would likely shy way from any kind of event, as was the case here, as the only two protesters at the event were these two people.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Your source is non-academic and biased. Taiqiyya is only to be used when one's life is in danger, and has historically been associated with Shi'a Muslims, who concealed their faith to avoid physical harm. I'm not lying to you, and it would be a sin for me to do so. Google that Quranic verse on non-compulsion in religion (which you ignored) if you don't believe me. 

 So you're in a minority. Or, you're lying. Either way, what do I care?

Ah, there we are. Your mind is closed. No matter what you learn or who you meet, you would stubbornly remain prejudiced against Islam and Muslims.  

Muslims like myself are the majority of the world's Muslims. As loud as the extremists may be, their attacks are isolated and don't spark that massive war between Muslims and "The West" (this doesn't make sense because many Muslims live in the West and consider themselves Western). I've attended many mosques and gatherings of different interpretations of Islam, from Sufi to Shia to even Salafi, and have never heard of imposition. 

 Facts define Muslims. A poll determines facts. If you believe those facts are in error, it is incumbent on you to demonstrate it, not just throw your hands in the air and claim you don't believe polls. You'd do just as well saying you don't believe in math.

Well, I'd suggest you show up to a mosque and sincerely and politely ask questions. It doesn't seem like you've ever met any Muslims. I'd sit down and talk with you, but as I mentioned before, you seem a bit closed minded, plus you'd probably physically attack me or something. 

I hope you find the truth, or at least, lose your hostility. Peace be unto you.

	<TEXT>  Yes, you implicitly did, just as the author of the article did, by implying that Geller's personality in any way whatsoever justified the response of attempted murder 

We clearly didn't read the same article, as Ali condemned the attackers, saying that Islam says to ignore them. There were no protesters at the exhibition, except the two attackers. The large Dallas-area Muslim community mostly stayed away. The writer in no way says that Geller's personality incited or justified the murder. 

By accusing me of implicitly supporting their actions, you're attempting to read my mind. Neither was justified in their actions, in my opinion. Geller's same "free speech" stance is undermined by the fact that she campaigned against Al Jazeera's launching a network in the United States.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A poll is supposed to define Muslims? I am a Muslim and in none of the mosques I've attended have I ever heard of anyone preaching that Islam should be imposed on anyone. Extremism exists, but it is called extremism because *it is beyond the pale and outside of the mainstream.* It not only flies in the face of religion practiced by the vast majority of its one-billion plus adherents, but also in Islamic history.  

People like to take verses of the Quran out of context. Well, see what you can do with this one:

Where on earth are you getting that idea? Nobody is apologizing for any attack. Based on your comments and seeming support for Geller, I could make a similar argument that your condemnation for Anders Brevlik's massacre is nowhere to be found either.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> **Submission Statement**

I'll quote from the article: 

"This is the first in a three-part investigative series on Chinas inroads in Texas energy industry. It follows [an investigative series](http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2015/1/26/chinas-louisiana-jindal-methanol-plant-environment-racism.html) on another push by Chinese politician-investors and U.S. officials for a methanol plant in a predominantly black neighborhood of St. James Parish, Louisiana."

In this article, Al Jazeera investigates US and Chinese interests behind a bid for $4.5 billion methanol plant in an underserved black community. </TEXT>

You have to understand, we American fans are a bit sensitive to criticism from people who look down on MLS and other soccer played in North America. Our league is a lot better than what people who don't watch and/or live overseas give it credit for.  </TEXT>
