	<TEXT> I work at a museum and I bring my 3DS to collect steps for playcoins on my lunch break basically (and that Pokemon Shuffle fix) and I noticed when I got home I had a streetpass from one of the kids I gave a guided tour to today. SO now I feel a bit creepy but hey at least I got an Eon ticket out of it. xD </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Pokemon X/Y is glorious. You would probably enjoy Omega Ruby or Alpha Sapphire too. 

I am not a huge fan of Black/White, but I do heartily recommend Heart Gold/Soul Silver and Diamond/Pearl/Platinum. But you don't need them for Pokemon X/Y to make you happy. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was tempted to make a throwaway, since the institution I work for is dealing with a potentially hairy NAGPRA claim right now but I have to say that yes I do. I don't know if NAGPRA is the law you are referring to (and I don't have much knowledge of legislation in other countries) but I do support reburial. I also support scientific study of remains. I know from personal experiences that compromises can be made that allow for study and documentation prior to repatriation.

Also, I can't think of a single example where remains in a historic context were not reinterred as soon as practical. Historic cemeteries are always moved if the archaeology is done right. I don't see why this same attitude does not get applied to prehistoric remains that lack a cultural association. They're still people! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So waaaay back in my first Pokemon game (Yellow) one of the members of my team was Nidoking. I didn't have any water types on my final crew I guess so I taught my Nidoking Surf because he could learn it for some reason. Ever since, in FR and HG and just today in X my Nidoking on my team has known Surf. 3

I think my first team was Pikachu, Nidoking, Scyther, Charizard, Articuno ... and someone else. I can't remember the sixth pokemon. ;-; EDIT- Haunter. I think it was Haunter.

What sorts of things do you carry over game to game? </TEXT>
