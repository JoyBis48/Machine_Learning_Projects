	<TEXT>  Market-beliefs are first and foremost humble ones - they stem from the idea that people on the ground know their own lives better than even the best intentioned of central planners somewhere.

This is a dogma, which has very little evidence backing it up. The dogma works assuming perfect and instantaneous flow of information along the whole market, along with completely rational participants. Neither of which exists in real life. Not only that market based investment is inherently myopic. Nobody invests in stuff which have a hazy chance of success fifty years down the line. Only the government does that - it is called basic research. Yet, without basic research technological progress is impossible. And this is just one example.

 This is ridiculous. How is "categorically destructive"?

Because libertarianism would lead to a whittling down of multiple government programs, from infrastructure to SNAP. For people already on the edge, removal of often one government program could be disastrous. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think the lifetime cost also includes the initial cash you pay to buy a slave. Including that, the lifetime cost of slave ownership outweighed the wages you paid a worker. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What is the problem with a piecemeal regulation if it is good? And as regards incentive, you may be different, but in many cases people have to work extra jobs just to make ends meet. The majority of American poor are actually employed, and there are significant populations of homeless, unemployed Americans. A place to sleep, and food to eat is a basic animalistic motivation, when you make people work two to three jobs just for that - then you cannot just wave it away as 
 In some cases, it's money.

You are confusing **need** with **incentive**. Two very different things.

And as regards, basic income it is still a fringe idea. Not a single mainstream candidate supports it, and yet without it libertarianism is categorically destructive.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I did not know that. Really interesting - thanks!

So, to imply the minimum wage must at least be equal to or higher than the maintenance cost of ownership of a human being. If not so, we really have not progressed since 1865. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am really curious to the overwork Americans put in by *consent*, rather than being motivated by the material concerns of paying the rent and putting food on the table.

Consent, by the way, is a big buzzword - as it should be. If someone, for example has sex with another person who is really drunk it would count as statutory rape in almost every jurisdiction. Because of impaired consent. Given the massive wealth stratification/ income inequality, we have to then ponder how much of the consent given by workers is fimpaired? To have a perfect libertarian world with perfect consent you would thus need to give people the liberty of saying no - i:e a social safety net. Which is exactly what libertarians want to dismantle. Given this inherent contradiction/paradox, tell me how can I take a libertarian seriously? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> But it still is 20% up since this January 2015. The larger problem with China is to find a stable parking spot for middle class savings. Because the volatility of the stock indices is fueled largely by Chinese middle class investors plowing their savings into stocks after getting burnt by real estate. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Three strikes and you are out - that's my policy. I am super busy in grad school, and I frankly don't have time for anyone's incompetence.

And the issue here, as the OP himself points out is not incompetence. Very few people are actually incompetent. Most supposedly incompetent fellows I have witnessed are plain lazy and don't just care. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not completely true. In fact it is often categorically false. Ritwik Ghatak had a much wretched life economically than Salman Khan. The poor, struggling artist is almost a cliche - from Poe to Van Gogh. If material wealth is a prerequisite for art - then Bollywood would be filled with auteurs. </TEXT>
