	<TEXT> Oh I'm not sure! Finnish is meant to be quite hard. Maybe when I have some experience with new languages I could try to hop on the finnish bandwagon :P </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hello! I'm a native english speaker and I'm looking for penpals who are willing to to correspond with me (either through email or snail mail) in a different language.

If you already know English, or have no interest in bettering your english language skills, you can write to me in your language and I'll respond in the same. However If you are interested in bettering your language skills, you can write to me in English and I'll respond back in your language. We can both exchange comments on sentence structure and give constructive criticism too.

I am looking to learn a variety of languages (though less of the grammar and tenses and more just being able to effectively communicate), however learning chinese and arabic do not agree with me. I have tried and It just didn't happen :/

Edit: Just to clarify - I speak NO other languages beside english and poor conversational french (which I wouldn't mind improving too). So this is going to be hard...

So comment or PM if want to be penpals :)

edit: Family stuff has made me really busy so I can't write to anyone anymore. Thanks to those who agreed to help me with this project.  </TEXT>
