	<TEXT> Hchste Kaiser has given the Overseer of Kaliningrad permission to begin a three year project to expand Kaliningrad's ports in order to increase trade and tourism. To put it simply, there will be more docks to accommodate more trade and tourist ships and also newer docks to hold larger ships. We will also be expanding the shipyards to increase the output of ships built in Kaliningrad. We hope that this will improve Kaliningrad's economy and allow us to connect with more countries through trade all over the world. </TEXT>

He will be taking a similar role as the Hchste Kaiser, only he will be reporting to and taking direction from his father. His job will consist of taking care of smaller legislation, overseeing the economy, and commanding the military within Kaliningrad. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> After years and years of construction, planning, and various delays, the wall around the country has finally been completed. The wall itself stands at fifty feet and the top is lined with artillery, mounted guns, and soldiers. There are several access points into the country all throughout the wall with military checkpoints. Finally Liechtenstein has the safety its citizens have always deserved. Everyone may note, that this is not a closing of the borders like last time, but simply a (extremely expensive) safety precaution. Glory to Liechtenstein!
