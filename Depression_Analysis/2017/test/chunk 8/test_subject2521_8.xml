	<TEXT> I am in the process of completing courses to apply to the School of Psychology. As of today, I have three courses (all in psychology) and need a suggestion on what to enroll in to fill that extra slot. If the art department allowed for students to take one measly class, I'd be set, but they don't, and now I'm left trying to decide on a class. 

Suggestions? </TEXT>

If it the action that the state of KS has taken is considered invalid, what makes those states think they can do the same thing?

	<TEXT> Fellow Pinckney resident here! 

A few shady homes and loud neighbors, but all and all, a great neighborhood. 

Best bet in finding a place would be to drive around the area and see what is for rent. There are a few apartment complexes - two of which are owned by the same family - and they are always an option if a home is not available.

	<TEXT> There are several different SPED departments and I work with students who are Emotionally Disturbed. These students range from having Reactive Attachment Disorder (RAD), Bipolar Disorder, ADHD, a student's father was schizophrenic and the student is quite paranoid and often lashes out, others have Autism (yes, it's real autism, not what people 'think is autism'), and Fetal Alcohol Syndrome. 

The kids need our help and would not make it through school without it. 

The students I work with are freshman and most are in intermediate classes. They need extra help when it comes to Geometry, Biology and Civics. Also, that's why I challenged my student. I knew he could do it and did not need to accept the teachers accommodation. </TEXT>
