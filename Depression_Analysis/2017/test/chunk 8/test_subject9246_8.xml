	<TEXT> Dinner is always my biggest meal. SO and I like to eat dinner every night together and his calorie allowance is a lot higher than mine. We usually compromise with a 500-600 calorie dinner.

Breakfast is around 200 - 300 calories.

Lunch is about 400 calories

If I have any left over I'll eat a little dessert or have a snack between meals. 

I aim to eat 1200 to 1300 calories a day.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 5'5" SW: 165 pounds CW: 152 pounds GW: 130 pounds


My first goal is to get to a healthy weight. Once I get below 150 I'll no longer be overweight.  So close! 


Then I want to continue to around 130, but that's not a set number.  If I feel and look good at a different number,  then that'll be my final goal weight.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Holiday Inn expresses usually have some sort of continental breakfast right? Last time I traveled I believed they had things like yogurt, hard boiled eggs, English muffins. You could easily track those things for breakfast. Then bring or purchase salad mixing and healthy sandwich items for lunch. Try to limit eating out to just dinner. Or eat out for dinner, but only eat half. Save the other half for the following day lunch.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Being told I look fine and don't need to lose weight.  I started 15 pounds above normal weight and now am only 5 pounds away from not being classified as overweight. I hope to lose an additional 20 pounds after I reach normal weight. That'll put me in the middle of the range for my height. Friends tell me I'm being silly because I look fine. But I'm overweight,  they just don't see it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You've been together for 6 years and still haven't met his son and he hasn't met your parents? Leave. If he has any relationship with his son, and hasn't felt the need to introduce you after 6 years, he has no plans on long term commitment.  

I'm (24) dating a man who is 36 and has a 7 yr old daughter and ex wife. I see his daughter almost every week, and I've met the ex wife. I'm currently living with my boyfriend, so an introduction to the ex seemed reasonable seeing as how her daughter lives with me when she visits her dad. 

As soon as things started to get serious, I met his daughter.  In my opinion 6 years is a very long time without meeting his son or your parents.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My boyfriend likes to eat doesn't care about counting calories. We like to eat together though. We will start planning a meal based on what meat we want. I may only eat 4 Oz serving while he eats 6 oz. Then we always have a decent size serving of veggie. He'll throw some cheese or butter on his. And then we add it some sort of grain. Once again he may add extra sauce or cheese or just a bigger portion than me. 

Basically we eat the same thing just slight variations that are easy to do as you go along.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I switch back and forth between http://thenourishinghome.com/2014/05/mock-kind-fruit-nut-grain-free-bars/ and http://blog.myfitnesspal.com/no-bake-granola-bars/ recipes. But I always vary a bit different than the recipe. I switch up the nuts, seeds, and fruits a lot. But stick to the total amounts of fillings and I stick to the liquid amounts, otherwise it won't bind properly. The no bake recipe is a tad sweeter, but good. If you like coconut, the kind bar is really good, also not quite as sweet which can be good. I make mine in a 6x8 pan because that's what I have. And cut them into 8 rectangles. Wrap them individually and keep them in the fridge. My boyfriends daughter who is 7 and picky loves them both.
