	<TEXT> That is a really great idea. Another cool feature of that, would be not only a logbook of your player, but of your character. So that every time you die, that log book would be reset. It would also be really awesome if you could read other character's log book after killing them. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> **A Way for Fitting Weapons into Your Backpack**

 nbsp;

Storing Weapons in your backpack can be a real big hassle due to the only way of storing it in there, is sideways. Although, if most of us were to store a weapon in a backpack in real life, we would do it facing up, right? So why not do that in DayZ. Make weapons take up the same amount of space, but let them face upwards. I thought of this because most weapons can not be stored in backpacks as the backpack's space in the inventory does not have a big enough width.

 nbsp;

Thank you to anyone who reads this, and have a great day! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That is the same as me. I play quite a lot of DayZ on medium pop servers (Australian). The one I saw (Actually I did not see them, because they were in the Camo building wall glitch) my friends ran in to try and secure it, because we had a farming hoe. Then suddenly one of them loses their gear, then they get carpet bombed. Luckily I was on the hill outside. This happened at Veresnik. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Agreed. Although the problem with night time in DayZ and the way people use it, saddens me. It is night time it is supposed to be dark, why maximise your gamma for extra visibility? They add the gas-lantern, torch and chemlight for a reason. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I also want the Developers to focus on the multi-player and optimizing, but we probably will not see much optimizing until the final version. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That would add a terrifying atmosphere to the game. Just imagine, your character looks at his watch (Please add devs) he sees the clock strike some time like (2:13 AM or 1:43AM) some time when it's dark. A gunshot is heard from out of nowhere, then a group of Bandits are running at you. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There would not be a linear story. You could side with Bandits and Heroes, maybe they would both have the same objective, but they would get there different ways. If eventually the devs let us learn their new scripting language and let us build custom mods for SA, I will learn and make this. You wouldn't even need to do the quests, you could just kill everyone and rule the land. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Of course. The objectives would be difficult and time consuming because you would get an approximate location of the items you are looking for, and those areas would be flooded with zombies or bandits/heroes. </TEXT>
