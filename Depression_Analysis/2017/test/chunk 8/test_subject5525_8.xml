	<TEXT> I'm the only wage earner in my family of four, and we recently found out our home (rental) sold...and we have 40 some days to get out. Things are progressing nicely, but it worries me at night...anything goes wrong in the next couple weeks would be a tragedy level event...

My kids are 5 and 7...my five yo girl doesn't want to move, and I worry for her...hoping that she adjusts to the move well.

Other than that, I'm good. The usual worries; losing my job, hoping the car makes it another year, the health of my family, my long term outlooks, our retirement. 

Jesus, I've got a lot to worry about. Thanks. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When someone wrongs us, there are two possible places to lay the blame; on ourselves, or on the person that wronged us.

This quote focuses on us, assuming that we already are forgiving of the person that wronged us, but reminds us not to think negatively of the decisions that we made that put us in the position to be hurt or treated badly by this other person.

We already don't hate him, but don't hate yourself for lettin' him hate you, you dig. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Depends on where in Florida you're going. The state of Florida has a rich history, with many different museums focusing on the different places in history that Florida has figured. From Ocean Pond in Olustee, in the north, site of one of only two Civil War battles fought in Florida, and certainly the bloodiest, to the Seminole Rez outside of Okeechobee, in the south, home of the last survivors of the Seminole Indians, a proud race that never submitted to the US.

Cape Canaveral and Kennedy Space Station in the mid-east of the state is America's Space Station. Can't go wrong there! 

On the mid-west coast, you have everything from the Ringling Museum in Sarasota to the Dali in St. Petersburg. Ft. Desoto, south of Tampa Bay, is an post-Augustine-era defense fort where you can learn about the first Europeans in Florida. 

Or just check out St. Augustine itself...in the northeast, site of possibly one of the oldest European presences on the state. (There is some evidence that Turnbull's site in New Smyrna Beach might be the oldest.)

This isn't even close to an all-inclusive list. Anywhere that you look in Florida, you will find some history. You might want to narrow your trip down, and then check the county website for the area(s) you are interested in visiting.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Unplug it.

Then use needle nose pliers. First, try to grip one end of the metal thingamabob and turn it that way, and if that doesn't work, use the pliers the opposite way....instead of to pinch, expand them to fill the metal thingamabob and try to twist it out that way.

Or, live dangerously, and after unplugging the lamp, cut a potato in half, jam it into the socket, and twist. It should pull the broken light bulb out with it. You must clean the socket before reusing, and for fuck's sake, dry your hands before plugging the lamp back in.

Don't forget to unplug the lamp. </TEXT>

If I'm standing there watching, and I see that the loser of the fight pulls a gun to protect himself, and then the winner of the fight pulls a gun to protect himself from the loser of the fight, don't I have a right to shoot the both of them to protect myself from becoming an innocent bystander? If I pull my gun to protect myself from the now two armed fighters from accidentally shooting me, wouldn't you have the right as another bystander to shoot the three of us?

I play fairly well, but a local regular stopped me on the turn one afternoon and said that he was watching me play and thought that he could help me take three to four strokes off my game. Then he asked if I'd like to play a round with him at some other time. I took him up on it, and played a round at our course and a round at our local pro course, and he gave me a couple of tips. They didn't take those three to four strokes off my game, but it helped.

We don't do an allowance per se, but I monetize certain awards and achievements. They often receive money as gifts, either birthday/christmas money, or just randomly when I have a couple of bucks in my pocket. We're not big consumers, we focus instead on making things and arts and crafts. I'm not anti allowance by any means, but just haven't seen the need for a stricter definition of it. Glad to change that as the kids get older.

As for hitting, we have always said that they have the right to defend themselves, but they must exhaust every other option first.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What the surveillance video shows is Brown having an altercation with the shopkeeper. It may have been about a robbery...of a fifty dollar box of cigars. So, in OP's opinion, as long as you're a suspect in a minor strong arm robbery, it's completely okay to be gunned down in the street, even after you've surrendered. Stop defending the actions of the domestic military police, OP. Even if you're a criminal, you still have rights. Right to a trial. Right to confront your accuser. Right to hear your charges. There is no right of the police to decide you're guilty and execute you in the street.

I understand your comment about Sharpton. He and his ilk swarm to stories like this to forward their own initiatives. But your comment "No surprise really..." (that was quickly edited) shows that we need a whole lot more people like the ones that working hard to show this story in the light of the very real racism and double standards that exist in our society.

We heard this same nonsense when Martin was shot in Florida. It didn't matter that a man had died once we understood that Martin was probably carrying or using drugs. Now we see the Ferguson authorities releasing information about this possible robbery even though they are tight lipped about the shooting. Why? Because we don't have to care about the death of another black man if he was "just another criminal." </TEXT>

It provides a connection to the food you eat, or the products that you use, that you don't get when just picking the shiniest thing off the grocery shelf, and many of these things are becoming further and further removed from our collective memory...(There was nothing on this list that was remarkable, I've made most of them myself at one point or another) and there may be a time where you find  yourself without power, or unable to reach a store, and being able to provide some basic comforts in that situation certainly will bring yourself some joy and contentment, don't you think?

	<TEXT> Former server, Guest services manager checking in here. 

The absolute worst waste of time in any servers night is when a table starts arguing about who is paying the check. 

If you are the only one to sneak a card to the server, this LPT will work, but other people in your party may want to try the same thing, and this just leads to a clusterf**k tableside for any server. The best bet is to have this figured out early, or if unclear, split the check evenly. Most restaurants have an easy 5050 payment option at their CC terminals.

I will say that when one of my servers comes to me and complains that they have a table arguing over who is going to pay the bill, I tell them that our policy is to respect whoever submitted payment first (no such policy) so your early card may work.

	<TEXT> I don't know exactly what you're looking for, but here are two of my favorite food bourn illnesses. Neither are germs, Anisakiasis is a parasitic infection, and CJD is a prionic disease, caused by a folded protein called a prion.

[Anisakiasis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anisakis#Anisakiasis) is a parasitic infection. You get it from improperly prepared fish that's infected with a nemtode. You can end up with bowel blockage from the resulting parasitic infection, sometimes requiring surgery to remove.

[CJD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creutzfeldt%E2%80%93Jakob_disease), or mad human disease, and other related neurodegenerative diseases. Similar to mad cow. Super scary because of these folded proteins called Prions, [which are notoriously hard to destroy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prions#Sterilization) compared to other pathogens, and the fact that they are not alive like a germ/microbe/virus, but are still able to create copies of themselves by folding other proteins. Can only be controlled by removing them from the food supply. Most institutional cleaning and cooking practices do not remove prions.

[Check out this article from last year](http://gprl6105.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/media_consolidation.jpg) that explains how just a few companies own all the media that you consume.

There isn't one (or a few) companies that control everything, it's more about the loss of choice in the marketplace, no matter what product that you're talking about. [George Carlin does a great piece on the Illusion of Choice.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SC_wjQtfhZQ) NSFW, obviously, the specific part about choice starts around 3:30, but watch the whole thing anyway. It's great.

The only thing else that I'll add, regarding down time, is learn to leave the job at the door. Set boundaries with staff and other management, and make sure that when you're off, you're off. That's your downtime, and it's terribly important. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Assuming that you want to be successful, the first thing I will say is trying to keep everyone happy is a guarantee to fail. It's not your job to keep everyone happy, it's to keep everyone on task and working effectively.

Saying that, here's some advice from 20+ years service management.

* **Set goals**. Talk to your service staff, and explain clearly what the expectation is. Whether it's some small extra cleaning project, or a special you want mentioned, whatever it is, tell staff ahead of shift what your expectation is. Don't forget to set goals for yourself, and follow through on them.

*  **Follow up**. As you work through any shift, or any week, follow up on the goals that you have set. If you have asked servers to mention a new special at every table, take time to listen to each server and make sure that they are. If they aren't meeting the goals that you have set, ask them why. At the end of the shift, take time to point out with each server that you noticed them achieving the goals you set, or not, as the case might be.

*  **Don't get in the way**. You have to be proactive in your management of staff, but take care that you are not preventing them from getting the job done. You have been FOH so  you know you are there to make money. Don't lose respect by doing anything that can cost your servers time, because time is money.

* **Correct on site**. If you see something, say something. Be brief, but concise, when you need to correct behavior. *Take care not to do this in front of other staff, unless you see it as a teaching moment that other staff can benefit from. No one likes to be singled out.*

* **Be first, be last**. You are the first one on a problem, and you finalize the issue. If there's a spill, you're the first on task. That doesn't mean that you clean it up, it means you're the first one there, looking for a busser/utility to get mops/wet floor signs/towels, directing staff to handle problems. You finalize the problem by making sure everything is taken care of, signs put away, mop taken off the floor, and at the end of the shift, reinforcing your policies for how you want your staff to handle spills. (That's a small example, but be  first be last is really some of the best advice I can give you. Apply it to everything. You have to be the first to notice something, the first to handle something, and the last person to deal with it, to make sure it is handled the way you/your restaurant wants it to be handled. Follow up with staff about whatever incident it was, and then move on. Don't beat a dead horse.)

*  **Positive, negative, positive**. It's cliche, but when counseling an employee, remember this pattern. Tell them something that they do well, compare that to something that they don't do well, and encourage them to do better with positive thinking/acting/speaking. (Ex: If you have to talk about an employee's complete lack of pre-bussing tables, start with "You know what, employee? You might be one of the best upsellers in the house. But it would help all of us if you could be a little more mindful of prebussing. If you apply yourself to prebussing your tables like you do to upselling, you'll be the best at that too." Cheesy example, but it gets the idea across.)

* **Don't ask anyone to do anything you wouldn't do yourself**. And prove it occasionally. 

* **No Down Time!** If you have free time, you haven't been planning correctly. Spend that time working on ideas, like staff comps, which are a great idea btw, or planning the next half of your shift, or your next shift, or your next week. Down time is your enemy. (It is important to take breaks occasionally, but breaks are different from down time.)

And lastly, if you truly want to be successful, you have to be the best. If you want your servers to be better cleaners, then you have to be the cleanest. If you want them to be quicker about greeting guests when they're sat, then you have to race them to the table. You can't just ask people to do things and expect that they will do them. You have to lead. And that's the hardest part. A leader leads, a boss bosses. Lead effectively, and they will follow. Boss, and they will resent you. 

Oh, and remember to ask. It's your job to tell the server that he has to mop his section. It's his job to do what you tell him and mop his section. Neither of those facts should change human decency. Remember to ask the server to do what you want. If he doesn't, then fall back on the bossman routine. (I learned that lesson at 19 in QSR from a fifty year old woman that I didn't ask. She reminded me that we were both human, and I don't forget that, ever.) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would have had your back. The girl with the shot and no ID should have been put out immediately. And, if I couldn't find out which one of the other party gave her the shot, the rest would have been put out as well, unless one of them owned up and I could put him/her out specifically.

Side story: When working in a counter service restaurant in a college town about ten-fifteen years ago, I had one of my girls not ID during a sting. Good employee, almost friend, dumb mistake. I went with her through all the nonsense and meetings and court dates, just so I could get a real taste of what that's like. I will not put myself or my employees at risk at all because of that experience. Her experience cost her about three days work requested off for various meetings and court dates (About $100 bucks a shift), $250 in court fees/fines, six months probation with supervision costs at $25 a month = about a $700 mistake. (The house paid half, just cuz we were like that.) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ummm, really? She might be guilty of making a bad decision but she's not at all guilty of her own rape. 

Whenever you start to think about this sort of thing, put yourself in that situation, and think about it like a mugging. (They are not the same, let's just use that example.)

"If a dude drank too much and passed out at a party and a criminal mugged them, is the man 0% at fault?"

or if you prefer

"If you yourself drank too much and passed out at a party, and some dude fucked you in your ass while you were passed out, would you be 0% at fault?"

This idea states that a woman can never cut loose and have a good time at a party because she might drink too much, and if she passes out and gets raped, it's kinda a little her fault. That doesn't sound right, does it? It's the same argument that leads to people thinking that a short skirt is a reason for rape, or a bad neighborhood, or being flirty, or changing your mind about hooking up with someone. 

The better question to ask here is why should a woman have to fear getting raped at some party? Throw better parties with better people. If she passes out at my party the worst that might happen is she'll be tucked in all safe and comfy in the guest bedroom without her permission.

	<TEXT> I'm curious what you all think about this as well. My place is set up the same way, four-top only sections, six-top only sections, and tables for pushing. I look at the numbers, and they really seem to match-up fairly well. Turning for volume will net as much as a big party in sales, and depending on customers, tips seem about the same, but I have a pretty big disparity in what my servers prefer. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes, absolutely. We love allergy cards, and advance notice by phone or at the door. We actually work very hard on allergen awareness and safety, and we were way ahead of the curve in comparison to other restaurants. That's partially why it's so frustrating; to put so much hard work into something, and have it derailed by poorly informed individuals. We have a guidelines book where we talk about food allergens and our ingredients are broken down for each item on the menu across the eight common allergens, and have resources for the kitchen for the less common allergens. We have team members that are trained to "go to the book" to look up allergy information when a server or manager needs to know about less common allergies. 

A perfect example of how this behavior puts people in danger is when we had a three top in the dining room, with one person claiming to be "allergic to gluten" (always introduce yourself as a Celiac first, then explain what that means to be taken seriously immediately) and one of the other guests claiming to be allergic to pepper. The server asked the gluten allergic customer whether it was an intolerance or Celiacs to determine whether cross-contamination would be an issue in her diet and was met with a blank stare and a comment along the lines of "I just can't have gluten"...she dismissed the table as "one of those" and followed our procedures for ingredient preferences as opposed to allergies. The second lady was served a steak, ordered without pepper, that was cross contaminated with pepper in the cooking process. I was doing FOH that night, and had to deal with the poor lady as her face began to inflate from her pepper allergy. Depressing to miss an easy opportunity for success when so much work is put into it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This allergy shit is out of control. I know Oprah said it on her show, and I've seen it in magazines as well...in one of those sections like "Restaurant Life Hacks, Getting the Perfect Order Every Time!" or some such nonsense.  

These damn near criminals suggest that if you don't want an ingredient in your dish that you tell your server that you are allergic to that ingredient, and that way they'll make sure that the ingredient is left out, because we don't want to kill anybody. Right?

These folks who wrote it, and all these customers who use this terrible advice every day don't understand that every time a story like /u/xnick58  happens, us BOH folks give just a slight shit less about the next time a server comes back there telling us that someone is allergic to something.

I've been in the business for almost thirty years now...in the last four years or so it's like there's been an outbreak of food allergy, of epic proportions! Why isn't this front page news? Apparently every blue hair in my city is fucking allergic to something, and none of those things are ever the eight commonest....it's always parsley or some such. Who the fuck is allergic to parsley! For fucks sake. And don't get me started on the gluten train. 

These people don't get that there are people out there that have real food allergies. The kind where if you eat a certain kind of food, you might fuckin die! Not bad gas because you're dairy intolerant, but can't fuckin' breathe, my throat is closing up, holy shit I'm dying food allergies. I work as a safety/nutritionist/allergen supervisor for my restaurant and staff, and this shit is out of control. If anybody has any ideas for re-educating the dipshit public about this very serious issue, I'm all ears. </TEXT>

She is also my filthy whore. 

There doesn't have to be a disconnect between the two. The things that she does to me with her mouth and her kissing our children goodnight are just expressions of love. The hand I use to fist her is the same hand I hold my daughter's in when we cross the road, and I do both out of love. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, let me offer the dissenting opinion.

No matter what was talked about ahead of time, you have to respect the comfort level of your partner. If she is not comfortable with something, you can't ask her to do it out of a sense of fairness.

What needs to be talked about here, between you two, is the issue of how you're feeling. Not that she owes you, no matter what implied agreement came before. Additionally, you need to decide what you want in regards to future MFM encounters. If you like it, then do it because you and her like it, and are comfortable with it; not to accrue points that you can cash in for a FMF at a later date.

Go talk to her, tell her what you told us, and make decisions based on how the two of you feel, currently, as opposed to what's "fair".

My wife and I are exploring options in our sexual relationship, and adding a third is one of the things that we're talking about. She is comfortable with an additional male, but an additional female makes her uncomfortable, no matter what rules can be placed. One of the reasons that we have not moved ahead with this is not because of my comfort level (I'm okay with a variety of third-male scenarios), not because of a perceived one-way street of pleasure (it makes me very happy to see her receive pleasure. More can only be better). What concerns me is that she will agree to something that she is not comfortable with (FMF) for her because she perceives a lack of fairness in the situation, and tries something that she knows is wrong for her, and could jeopardize our relationship, and that is far more of an important issue than any other. 

The goal here is to keep your SO happy and safe. Go forth with that in mind.
