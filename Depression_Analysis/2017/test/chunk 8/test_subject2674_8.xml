	<TEXT> Is this question related to this article/research? http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/23/science/aphantasia-minds-eye-blind.html?_r=0

Because I have a hard time picturing things, even faces of people that I see daily.  I just get a vague sense of what they look like, not a complete image.  I wish I could access the researchers' survey and see how I compare with the rest of the population. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In addition to the outline idea (which is way more important than a lot of people realize) I have friends who swear by starting out their results section by choosing and creating/prettying up the figures and tables that will go into it.  If you don't like writing and/or are a more visual person, this is a way to start thinking about the important parts of your findings and what they mean before you have to start cranking out a lot of words.  You kind of sneak yourself in the back door of writing the thesis.

Edit: also, I'm sorry to hear that this has been such a difficult time period for you.  I hope you are able to finish things up and move on to something happier and better! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Since they did their experiments with adults, I'm not sure how the researchers are ruling out that instinctive tendency to cooperate has been suppressed by learning/cultural influences.

Edit: I think part of the issue is with the headline.  In psychology, at least, it appears that "intuition" and "instinct" are NOT the same thing.  Instinct is innate behavior, something one is born with.  "Intuition" has to do with subconscious thought processes that are still related to experience or learned information. http://cogsci.stackexchange.com/questions/767/difference-between-instinct-and-intuition

The researchers did not directly show anything about instinct; they looked at subconscious vs. conscious decision-making in inexperienced and experienced people. (Similar to what /u/dont_press_ctrl-W notes.) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I actually think they don't have to be mutually exclusive.  For example, scratching a rash is both a reaction to the symptoms, and something that might exacerbate those symptoms. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A lot of snail species are hermaphrodites; some of these species have to take turns playing the "male" and female" roles with a partner, so that they can both reproduce.

	<TEXT> This is a little bit skewed.  The average age of onset is 18 in men and 25 in women; that's past puberty, and particularly for women is well past the age one might begin smoking.  In addition, the research specifically looked at whether smoking behavior predated the schizophrenia diagnosis, and part of their argument is from the cases in which it does.

The researcher is trying to suggest that we should look into nicotine use as something that might influence the tendency to develop schizophrenia.  If the association continues to hold up in other studies, it would be one more reason to encourage people not to smoke. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> i agree with your general message here, but I wouldn't say it's "barely a study."  It's a meta-analysis of 61 other studies.  There are some drawbacks to combining data from studies done at different times and on different populations, but it also gives you a lot more data to work with, so that it's easier to see broad patterns. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think the word "influence" would be more clear than "cause."  Schizophrenia has a multifactorial cause; genetics and environment both play a role.  What the researchers are suggesting, and trying to encourage further investigation of, is that if an individual has some predisposing factors to schizophrenia, smoking could be something that pushes them further toward diagnosable disease.

My institution doesn't give me online access to the journal that published the original work, otherwise I would try to comment on the statistics that lead them to state that they can distinguish self-medicating behavior from smoking as a risk factor; but they do state that they are aware of this confound. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In case it's confusing, "discrimination" in this context just means an organism treating its close relatives differently from other organisms of the same species. The word doesn't have the negative connotation that it does in human society.  In this case, bacteria are shown to evolve the ability to recognize closely related strains and share space with them, while not sharing space with unrelated colonies. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> "Clearly most smokers do not develop schizophrenia, but the researchers believe it is increasing the risk.

The overall incidence of the condition is one in every 100 people normally, which may be increased to two per 100 by smoking."

This is a much better representation of the findings than the title used here. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I guess it depends on what you mean by favorite, but in terms of accurate portrayal, Cathy Ames from *East of Eden.*

I also like the reader is encouraged to feel some compassion for her, since she is described as someone born with a disability or deficiency, although an emotional rather than a physical one. </TEXT>

Did you do strengthening exercises to help retrain yourself?  Did you do anything (videotaping, etc.) to look at your stride?  How long did it take to start feeling natural? </TEXT>
