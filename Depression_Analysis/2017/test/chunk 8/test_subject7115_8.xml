It was also just a tough year for me because I was dealing with all my emotions and the thought that I should kill myself, which I almost did, but I'm glad I didn't. I made senior year different for myself and I brought a better attitude with me. I still didn't go because I kept longing for someone to spend it with in a intimate way, which friends can't do. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well I'm glad you're taking control. My parents sure didn't and I'd hate to see a kid go through the shit I did because of their weight. Grandparents are supposed to be those guys to spoil but even they should know when to stop so maybe just talk to your parents and/or in-laws about it. Packing him a healthy lunch for school might be something too. It's ok to indulge every now and again on sweets and junk but teach him that if that's all he eat, it's a very difficult road filled with many serious health complications. I know it's like I'm giving you a lecture but its all in best interest. Wish someone would've done it for me. Keep it up and best of luck! </TEXT>

Jinkx can display glamour when asked, she's funny, she can really act and sing and for me that's the total package and what a superstar is. Alaska is almost in the same boat only because she can't sing. I like Alaska's style more than Jinkx's. Roxxxy is just all beauty and no substance IMO. Jinkx and Alaska are entertainers in all respects of the word, whereas Roxxxy is look. </TEXT>
