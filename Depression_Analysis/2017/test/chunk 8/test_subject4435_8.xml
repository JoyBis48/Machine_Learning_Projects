	<TEXT> Not here! That's why I'm asking about other people's communities! Here anyone you think might be butch is gender queer or trans. Which is TOTALLY fine. But butch women seem to be curiously absent! Leading me to wonder if it's just here, or if it's everywhere! </TEXT>

I guess the simplest explanation is:
Women who dress in a masculine fashion, and don't feel a need to identify as anything except women who dress in a masculine fashion. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's... Well it's a difficult explanation really. Because it's one of those silly sub-types of labels. BUT. To me it's truly butch, not androgynous. Not trans. Manners, cockiness, knowing how to treat a lady. I fully expect to catch heat for this but it's women who enjoy being women but also dress like men and don't feel the need to be anything BUT a woman who dresses masculine. 

That was the worst explanation ever. I'm sorry. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey all!
I have a question!
Do "old school butch" women still exist? Where I live (Atlantic Canada) it seems like "true butch" just got totally obliterated before I was even a baby gay.
What are your communities like? Does "old school butch" mean anything to you? All opinions welcome! Show me what you know! :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Also I'd like to add that spontaneity is a factor, as well as potential intoxication. Those things, being drunk, high swept up in a moment, they can cloud your judgement. You may realize once you're in a situation that you're not comfortable. You should then be able to say that no, you're not comfortable, and that the situation needs to end. 

If we equate what you've said to a different crime perhaps you will see where you went wrong. On a first date, should I inform the person that I'm having tea with that I wouldn't be comfortable being murdered in any way, and that abduction is not something I'm into?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What's unrealistic is to state your sexual boundaries before you've even spent time with a person and gauged sexual chemistry and interest. I shouldn't have to start every first date with "I need to have protected sex." Because clearly I'm not going to have sex with all of those people. No does actually mean no, even though that phrase has been used to much it has almost no meaning now. I should be able to decide at any point during a sexual encounter that what's happening is not okay with me, and have that encounter end or change pace. I shouldn't be forced to complete an act I'm not comfortable with simply because I did not state when I met this person, that I was uncomfortable with something. </TEXT>

Edit: My family always said to ward off Fae you should carry a piece of iron on you and place it above your doorways as well. We use horseshoes above the doors. The Fae can't stand iron. Nor can they stand salt so putting a line of salt at your exterior doorways should keep you safe when you're indoors. </TEXT>

Secondly, it takes an extraordinarily large and long-term addiction to the drugs to produce the green blood reaction. For example, mixing heroin and oxycontin for an extended period will sometimes produce it. However, everyone's body chemistry is different and not everyone will have the same reaction.

Quitting smoking made it so unbearable that I didn't leave my house for 2 weeks and basically just decided to keep smoking so I could walk my dog without incident. I haven't sorted out what triggers it yet, I seem to just be on a 3 day rotation of can't stop/can't go. Maybe I'll give the walk in clinic a shout and see what they can do for me! Thanks! </TEXT>
