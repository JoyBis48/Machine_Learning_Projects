	<TEXT> I completely agree. The mural leads to the UFO spotting and that's probably about it. If anything, they're making fun of us all because of the whole conspiracy theory stuff. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As anyone would tell you, it's just sort of unbearable and hard to deal with. I don't like taking about it so people don't think I'm looking for attention or anything. People really give me a hard time about my issues like motivation, laziness, and my blunt opinions and I don't want to say "I'm only doing it because I'm sad" because that sounds like an excuse so I'm just stuck dealing with it from both ends and it's been like this for years. My mother had me at an early age, to a drug addict. So I have that in my blood. My grandmother though, had my mother with someone who had severe mental health issues like depression, paranoia, and anger she has those traits and so do I now. The only difference is that she is less passive and more aggressive. She can be cruel, selfish, lazy, etc. Me and my sister mostly had to find our own food or rely on our grandmother to raise us. If we were thirsty she'd say "Drink your spit" or "Sip my beer" (she's an alcoholic too). She would lock me in the bathroom with the light off as punishment which was terrifying to me. I remember banging on the door and yelling and I feel like that's where my fear of the dark came from. Now that I'm older she's even worse. She promised us all our lives that we'd have college money and she spent it all. The house is a mess and the pets aren't taken care of because she has allowed her younger friends to control the house. They've beaten up my friends and threatened me with her in the room. It's like I don't have anywhere to go and I'm stuck. I can't make myself happier because very thing that used to make me happy doesn't work anymore. I can't get away because my job doesn't give me enough to live on my own. My own family is giving me a hard time with it and I'm just so fed up with trying to do it on my own and explain myself to everyone. It's not fair and I can't do it anymore. I never asked for any of this. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well it just feels like I know my mistakes and I know what I do wrong. I half ass my work, I'm critical of others (Not insensitively, I just want them to do the right thing. But I don't sugar coat it. They get very defensive). I'm possessive in relationships, I also don't sugar coat things when it comes to that either. Then there's things I'm just ashamed of like my sex life. My sex life isn't exactly inactive, I just am not happy with my performance or nervousness usually. Then things like how I talk with people in public. People will say something to me and my mind just goes blank and I come up with the worst responses, it's terrible. I can't form relationships of any kind and people don't know what to think of it. I read a post on here a while back about this condition where depression is what a large percentage of your brain power is focusing on so it spaces you out and makes it harder to think about anything else including conversation. </TEXT>

It's currently on a flash sale for 50% ($12)

Is it worth the few extra dollars or no? I only have $40 I save for the rest of the sale. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sorry I didn't even think about it, I can't see the rules on my mobile app anyway. I apologize though.

I'm not sure if it's exactly self-learned, more like self-aware in my opinion... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Me too, it's almost unthinkable that PC's are becoming a more popular platform than consoles at this point. I have a huge wishlist of games on Steam though. Some of the ones I'm looking for deals on would be D4, Project Cars, Mortal Kombat X, and Killing Floor 2. What about you? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I read a post on here not too long ago about someone saying that Fallout 4 was keeping them going and I related to that one a bit but currently this is what's keeping me going. PC gaming is my hobby and I enjoy it very much. It's the one thing that makes me happy so I'm glad something good is happening revolving my hobby very soon.

Happy spending, to anyone who is a PC gamer! </TEXT>
