	<TEXT> I agree with you on the Family Guy part, but at least the Simpsons writers try. The show might not seem as good as it used to be, but that's really just because it's changed to cater to a more modern audience. Family Guy is literally just beating dead horses and making pop culture references. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think this is pretty realistic. Other than having Gwendolyn Christie and maybe Harrison Ford at SDCC, it's possible that they bring out Ewan McGregor at the end of the panel to announce an Obi-Wan movie. I think this would make up for the absence of a TFA trailer, and they could even show a teaser for the Kenobi movie, similar to what they did with Rogue One at Celebration. </TEXT>

And besides, they don't want Star Wars to be overshadowed by DC if another BvS trailer comes out - they want to be the ones breaking the records for trailer views, not their competitors.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No - I think both Kathleen Kennedy and JJ Abrams realize that these new movies can't rely on nostalgic references to older movies. They're trying to get a new generation into the Star Wars world, and if they want to do that, they must put story first, and not callbacks to earlier films that the audience might not understand. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah but it's not foreign. Foreign director =\= foreign film. It has a 60.000.000 budget, is being distributed by a major (American) studio, stars American actors, and was filmed in Canada. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It is, but here's my theory as to what happened.

The chocolate was originally wrapped on the outside, but they did it wrong, causing all of them to turn out like [this](http://imgur.com/Ek3DA3K)

So, they unwrapped all of them and closed them the right way, leaving most of them completely unwrapped and some of them partially wrapped in plastic, like [so](http://imgur.com/H9gMiQR) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The Star Wars prequels are pretty boring in a lot of parts if you think about it - trade negotiations, boring scenes of sitting on couches and talking, stupid dialogue - and those still made tons of money - the same would apply to Jurassic Park (which, by the way, I don't find boring in any part). </TEXT>
