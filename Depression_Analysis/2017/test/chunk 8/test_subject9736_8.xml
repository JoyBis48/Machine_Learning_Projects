	<TEXT> This kind of Hollywood studio greed ensures smaller VOD operators really don't have much of a chance, killing competition and helping piracy to thrive. And this could ironically lead to the studios' downfall - only the strongest operators survives, and a monopolistic behemoth is usually created as a result (ie. Netflix, or iTunes for music, Amazon for eBooks), someone that will end up having all the power to set the (licensing) terms in the future! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Welcome to the club! 

I've found my Blu-ray buying rate halved since I started using Netflix (been geo-dodging for two years now). I had been wasting a lot of money on crappy movies, just because I wanted something new to watch. Netflix is now my source for all things crappy. 

The money I've saved have gone into going to the movies or buying movies that I actually like, thus reducing my pirated download rate as well. </TEXT>
