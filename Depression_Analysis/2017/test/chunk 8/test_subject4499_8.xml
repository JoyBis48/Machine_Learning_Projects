	<TEXT> This reminds me of a talent show my friends entered as a band back in high school. Of course the school wanted to review what each group would perform, so once they read the lyrics to "killing in the name of", they told the singer of the band he had to change "fuck you, I won't do what you tell me" or don't play it at all. Fast forward to the performance, he actually had the vagina to scream "screw you, I won't do what you tell me."

I feel he totally missed the point of the song.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I've recently switched from iTunes to foobar200. I love the interface and the customizability so far.

I am having an issue with organizing my library. Turns out some albums in my music folder do not have the track number in the file name, but only in the tag. As such, those albums are now organized alphabetically in my foobar library. I have done some research, and have found I should sort by "%album% %tracknumber%" with no luck.

I'd really like to avoid having to update any album that doesn't have the track number in the song file names. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Sorry if this is redundant or the wrong sub, first post here. </TEXT>

I still buy CDs, and this software is the best I've come across. I'm sure one could acquire it for free, but I support them because it's so great. Not only rips CDs in FLAC/320, but fills out all identification tags and adds album artwork. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's the health epidemic that's sweeping the nation. If you and your product cannot be synonymous with healthy active living, it will fail in today's market. 

I'm not saying there's anything at all wrong with healthy living, but I can't help but feel it's forced down my throat every day, and this picture is a perfect example of it.

Every time I eat a cheeseburger or have a cigarette I can't help but feel overwhelmingly guilty, it really sucks.

	<TEXT> I'm not sure they have a website, it's really just a butcher on a farm North of the city. They offer just about anything you can think of. They have all sorts of game meat (elk, bison, deer etc), and of course chicken, pig, and beef. A big juicy New York Striploin is about 10 dollars, and personally for me, the best thing I've ever eaten. 

I stock up on all my meats there, hamburger, whole chickens, bone-in hams, steaks, bacon, and sausages to name a few. It's worth seeking out and having a look for yourself.

(FYI - you have to call in and pre-order bone-in hams this time of year)

"Holy fuck that's amazing, I would buy that in a heart beat"

"Ok we'll release it in like, 6 months"

"Alright 6 months has passed here you go!"

"This is nowhere near what you described 6 months ago."

"Oh yeah, well about that, we totally shouldn't have promised 6 months, more like 8. Sooooo sorry."

"As a consumer I should be outright pissed off and demand my money back. But because this is the current state of the world and it's lack of quality assurance, I'm totally ok with it." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Mine will always be The Exorcist. I will never forget the feeling of utter dread it instilled in me when I was about 10 years old and seeing it for the first time. I've been hooked on horror ever since.

After that I would say (in no particular order):

The Shining

Exorcist III

Martyrs

Jacob's Ladder

Silence Of The Lambs

I do own a couple of guitars, and I do strum them like an idiot from time to time, but I know talent when I hear it, or so I like to believe.
