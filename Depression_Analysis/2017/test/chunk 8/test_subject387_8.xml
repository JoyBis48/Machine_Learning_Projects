	<TEXT> What I usually do is throw a couple of Roundhouse Kicks to the body have them thinking about that motion. Then, I'd do an Out-To-In Axe Kick which initially follows the same motion as the back leg Roundhouse Kick and then dropping it over my opponent. If it misses the head, it will hit the body. The Axe Kick, in my opinion, is a kick that covers one of the greatest amounts of range amongst all kicks.

I can't tell if Hug is hitting with heel or the ball of the foot, either or - the most important thing, it seems, is after getting the technique down - the timing.

I'm going to be honest and say I spam a lot of Axe Kicks. I'm going to stop using them so excessively in order to heighten my chances of nailing a really good one and dropping my opponent. 

Just throwing an axe kick without any strategy isn't going to end well.

Right on. It seems to work well as a jam/cancel/trap attack so I'll try working my Axe Kicks on the motion. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> A lot of people, including the coaches at my own dojang, will religiously remind their students to keep their guard/hands up. However, if the top-level guys are having their guard down - is this the most efficient way to spar? Arms hanging at the sides to intercept fast roundhouse kicks from touching the Hogu? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Realistically, what's the potential for a short male competitor (under 5'8'') to ever have a chance at competing in the Olympics for Taekwondo? </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Even in the Flyweight division, the shortest Olympic athlete that placed in London 2012 was 5'10'' which is quite tall compared to my size, 5'7''.  Of course, *anything* is be possible - but regarding EBP, E-Hogus, or Daedo -  scoring tends to favor the fighter with the longer reach.  Especially in a fast-paced game that now favors the lead leg cut kick to keep your opponent at bay and to cancel their kick, which works especially well for taller guys.

I do fine against taller opponents via regular chest guard but against taller guys with the E-Hogu - it's very difficult and I'd imagine, at the Olympic level, seemingly impossible.

The same strategy applies for taller, faster fighters I'd imagine - stay outside their kicking range and don't linger on the inside for too long. Angles and feints. Of course, that's easier said than done - especially if the lengthier fighter has a very good guard.

In fact, a strategy that my coach developed against tall fighters with strong guards that involves making them go negative via penalty points in order to win if traditional scoring just is not working at all. (Focusing on knocking them down/off-balance to make them fall while avoiding losing any points, getting them to step out of the ring, etc.)

Basically, it's a definitely harder to go up against a taller opponent, no question about it. But regarding getting into the Olympic-level in a game that favors height and speed, is that even possible?

Sorry if my grammar doesn't make sense, it's late at night and this is something that's been on my mind lately. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah I just watched this video recently. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sgb1Attfm-0

It explains that they hold off on sparring until Blue Belt because it provides a good base for students to spar with when they finally do it. Sparring can be scary and as a white belt you usually end up getting murdered a lot - that can be discouraging and lead to many people giving up and quitting. Holding off on sparring gives them more confidence which leads to more people sticking with GJJ - according to the video. The video also lists their stats on how many people have joined and stayed since they incorporated this new system of instruction regarding the sparring in contrast to how many people have joined and left before the new system. </TEXT>

I feel like I'm not learning. Also, I should probably point out that my TKD instructor is also a Black Belt in Judo. </TEXT>

I heard that if you want aesthetic arms, you must add isolation. Compound exercises do hit the bi's and tri's but doing compound with added isolation will, obviously, hit them even more. Ofc, this is just based on what I've read. I'm a gym n00b. Please help. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> He does indeed mention "Bunshin," however he STILL makes the damned mistake of pointing it out as a **Ninjutsu**. The Ninjutsu variant of the clone jutsu is the Kage Bunshin or Shadow Clone. Bunshin, regular clone technique, is a **Genjutsu**.

	<TITLE> Error/Mistake in the Original Naruto series regarding Naruto v. Neji's Chuunin Exam Fight? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-06-29 14:01:23 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> After Naruto knocked down Neji, he proclaimed that he failed the graduation exam three times because of one jutsu that was always on the exam. His clones were pathetic, he said. He failed the **Shadow** Clone Jutsu/**Kage** Bunshin no Jutsu every time.

Interesting, except solid Shadow Clones/Kage Bunshins are not expected of Academy Students to create in order to promote to Genin.  He learned that technique from a Forbidden Scroll that contained the 2nd's Jutsus along with it's more advanced, forbidden version - the Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu/Tajuu Kage Bunshin no Jutsu.

Even Kakashi was surprised to witness that Naruto could truly use Shadow Clones in their first bell test.

I checked both versions, the Dub and the Sub for consistency and both versions mention that the Kage Bunshin no Jutsu was on the Academy Promotion Exam.

Even when we see Naruto test for his exam in the very first chapter/episode, he was asked to perform the Genjutsu-Variant, Clone Jutsu/Bunshin no Jutsu.

So what gives? This has always irked me since I first saw the episode.

	<TEXT>  Not speaking from experience, but for martial arts wouldn't you want to focus on speed and power, not size and strength. 

Definitely. But, I'm on "off-season" for competition and this is my first year going up in the Senior Division (18+). A lot of guys cut down to my weight class at 135 or 128 from two, maybe even higher weight classes so they have a sizable strength advantage over me.

I've always been a relatively small guy so I wanted to use this time to focus on building strength and mass and then cutting later once I get to competing again.

Are 5 day splits generally used for building muscle?
