	<TEXT> Similar but different...  There was a guy who was a hole behind us, but he was hitting out of our fairway, buy the green, only 150 yards away.  He was just standing there waiting for his fairway to clear or something, but he was holding us up, which was holding the guys behind us up, which was holding up his fairway...  5 minutes of us standing there yelling atamd signaling the guy, I finally hit into him (over and onto the green), and as we drive up he starts taking shit.  Closest I've ever come to kicking the shit out of someone on the course. 

When we pulled up he was like "what the fuck dude?!".  I was actually  polite at first and told him that he was in a group behind us and in our fairway, and to keep the pace of play, should of let us hit first.  His reply was "Fuck you", which is when I lost my cool and said "fuck me?! No, FUCK YOU!  Say one word and you'll catch an ass wooping, and I'll catch a case!"   Which is when he picked up his ball and walked away muttering something. 

So,  I know what it's like to lose my cool.  But when ever people hit into me, i just pick up their ball, show it to them, and throw it into the woods, water, or off into the rough.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've worked my game backwards, from green to tee.  Been playing 8 years now.  I started with pitching, chipping, and flop shots, but couldn't hit a long iron or driver to save my life.  I mostly focused on keeping my short game good and I shot in the upper 110's then slowly into the 90's. This winter I took some golftec lessons and focused on my irons, and in now shooting in the mid 80's to low 90's.  I want to jump into another set of lessons with my driver, but I don't want to push it too soon. But you're right, until I can find the fairway (or stay out of trouble) from the tee, I'll never be close to going as low as I want.  </TEXT>
