	<TEXT> My wife and I started playing with her brother and while each of us are not bad at the game by ourselves, we don't seem to be the best at doing it together. The wife died three times, and her brother and I died once. She survived the rest of the first winter just barely and was able to revive me and that's where we are now. 

I've been trying to focus on food supply but I'm finding it difficult to feed 3 people. I've been trapping rabbits like crazy but I haven't been able to build any kind of food surplus, we're always just barely getting by at the end of the day. I have two bee boxes but I don't want to use the honey because adding one honey to any of the recipes with a morsel makes honey nuggets which isn't nearly as filling as meatballs. I haven't really found a good way to get full sized meat to make honey ham </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Our living room is pretty secure but the only thing that remains keeping him in here is a gap between the couches at a 90 degree angle. For a little while we had a little bouncer seat we'd turn sideways and that would keep him in here but now he figured out how to move it because it's pretty light. 

[here's the spot in question] ( http://www.imgur.com/HEQUazQ.jpeg) 

As you can see he heads straight to the rod iron chair which happens to be where our cat likes to store his toys at. I think by the time he's old enough to jump up onto the couch and get off the other side we'll be more okay with him wandering the kitchen, my only worry would be him falling on those rod iron chairs, but they have been in the wife's family for a long time and have been through 6 babies/kids </TEXT>

	<TEXT> He goes through a few stages. First he babbles and rolls around, then he takes his pacifier and starts banging it on the sides of the crib. Sometimes he throws the pacifier out of the crib or drops it down the back side which sends him into the second stage. If he's still holding the pacifier he'll start getting upset that it's not in his mouth and he'll also start rubbing the crap out of his eyes and then move onto stage 2. 

Stage 2 is more rolling activity, even more eye rubbing and moans and groans that slowly climb in their volume and intensity

Stage 3 comes after the breaking point of stage 2 and now he's crying but not CRYING. This stage will also rise in intensity until the next stage

The last stage is inconsolable crying and hyperventilating. 

He will successfully climb through these stages by himself without assistance or intervention, and sometimes even if we are patting him on the or talking to him he still may get to stage 4. I can count on one hand how many times he has gone to bed peacefully. By far the best time was when we were visiting his grandparents and it was near bedtime when we were coming home so we changed him into his jammies there. He cried on the way home but fell asleep in his car seat. I was able to successfully get him out of the car seat without waking him up and transfer him to his crib. But I don't think car rides right before bed is a habit I want formed </TEXT>

Then around 8 is bath time if he needs one, then he gets his last bottle while he gets read a bedtime story and he's in the crib by 9. It has been that routine since he was 2 months basically and he still won't go down easily for naps or bed time </TEXT>

Then he starts making sound, moans and groans at first. Then it turns to a whining cry, then an actual cry, and it progresses like that until he's plugged up his nose with snot, and either hyperventilating or screaming the most wretched scream you've ever heard. That's if we leave him to his own devices. But sometimes being there and patting him or talking to him also makes him upset. This kid just does NOT want to sleep.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My son is coming up on 10months and he's great during the day but nights are a spectacle to behold. Putting him down to sleep is worthy of a competition for who can do it the fastest. We've had the same exact bedtime routine since he was 2 months and he's not any better at going to bed or for naps now as he was then. He does nothing but fight it and refuses to self sooth. I've looked up sleep training but I don't see anything different with that than what we've already been trying. Once he's asleep, he almost always sleeps until morning but if for any reason he wakes up in the middle of the night, he will not go back to sleep for any reason. He does not sleep like a baby, he sleeps like a Vietnam War veteran with one eye open and the other on his pistol on the nightstand </TEXT>

Laws don't always make sense. 

I did it for two years and never got in trouble and I had already knew what I would say if I was reprimanded in any fashion for looking out for my own safety.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Laws don't always make sense. Bikes on the road are no better than someone walking on the road as far as safety goes. I'd argue it's actually worse because there's less chance of a person suddenly swerving out in front of you to avoid a rock in front of them. When I rode a bike in Bozeman, I rode on the sidewalk because I don't want to be killed from behind by a car and if I were to run into a pedestrian, it is far less deadly than a car hitting me </TEXT>

	<TEXT> And today by far has been the worst of it. He has been incredibly difficult to feed, trying to squirm out of eating the solid foods and many times outright refusing his formula, and even if he does drink it, it will be like an ounce at a time on his own terms. He has always gotten 6oz of formula 4 times a day and he hasn't had a problem with it until very recently. 

On top of this, his sleep has never been worse. Putting him to bed at his normal time works fine but if he wakes up for any reason at all you might as well give up on getting sleep for the rest of the night because no matter how tired he is, he won't fall back asleep. For at least the last week he has been waking up 4 hours after getting put to bed and is up crying the rest of the night unless you give up and take him downstairs and let him be awake. He's cranky all day long because he's tired and yet he refuses to sleep and even naps are half hour if you're lucky. We both are at a complete loss at what to do </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This kind of stuff sucks for everyone involved. Sysco, USF, AND FSA drivers are all worked like dogs and as a result don't do proper pre-trips on their trucks, are always in a rush, can never arrive on a regular schedule because of the volume of stops they have each day and can also cause them to have negative attitudes, which is only worsened by being chewed out at every stop. I sympathise and empathise with both parties as I have both worked in kitchens and I am currently a delivery driver of the beverage variety. My job is difficult but it looks like a cakewalk compared to Sysco. I talked to the Sysco driver that delivers to one of the grocery stores I deliver to, and during the summer it's common for him to be out at 4am and still not be done with all his stops by 7pm. Fuck. That. Shit. 

As for sales reps, if they are fucking up orders then fuck them. That part of the job is easy as shit.  </TEXT>
