	<TEXT> I agree. Dogs don't like to put themselves where they're likely to be reprimanded by the owner. They're taught to play nice otherwise they'll get a paddlin' and I don't think you can teach cats the same sentiment. The real 'dick' in these videos are the owners, causing the conflict with, and then laughing at their dogs trying to cope with mixed messages. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  "what the fuck do I say to this guy?"

I felt the same way when I met him. All I could muster up was to continue a joke conversation that Aaron North started when he was signing a record of mine. Trent didn't hear my stupid joke, but was nice enough to get me to repeat it so he could hear. I managed to get a smirk from him, so at least I've got that going for me.

	<TEXT> You're right. It is the worst type of post because it turned into a circlejerk of sorts. It was initially in defense of AskMyFavouriteColor's comment. Walk down the street and ask the first ten strangers you meet what a Cerberus is and you'll get a blank stare from at least 9. I can guarantee that the majority of people on this thread that recognise a Cerberus, recognise it from Harry Potter - one of the most widely read pieces of fiction of the last two decades. A smaller percentage will have already of known it from ancient mythology.  So it shouldn't be accepted that everyone should know.  I started editing because of something I remember reading on Reddit recently. That was there are some things that you can't criticize on Reddit and Harry Potter is one of them. I was merely curious and wanted to put it to the test.  </TEXT>

Edit: I haven't read or watched the Harry Potter series.

Edit 2: I think the Harry Potter series is overated.

Edit 3: It's amazing people are still reading this down here. Also, I imagine that J.K. Rowling stole many ideas for          Harry Potter.

	<TEXT> Nothing special to report, really. There is a main water pipe and sewerage system that runs the length of my street. Due to age, and because of the hill that my street runs over, these pipes have always been problematic and there is always maintenance going on. One day a few months back it was shit city. The sewerage pipe burst while they were trying to fix it and a brown river gushed down the hill for an hour. They 'fixed' it again up until yesterday when the street sharted, as per the photo. All good for now.

TL;DR - Problematic sewerage pipe. </TEXT>
