	<TEXT> If he was white he probably wouldn't have said anything. It's small things that create racism. Sure mentioning he's black was harmless and maybe he was just being descriptive but he probably just mentioned he was black because it's not a generally a black profession and it's isolating blacks as whole. Who cares if he was black or white there was literally no point in saying it. If he cares that much about how it looked he could watch the gif himself. </TEXT>
