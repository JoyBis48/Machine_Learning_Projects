	<TEXT> I am generally OK with the many larger changes the show makes - Sansa taking Jeyne's place, Jamie and Bronn in Dorne, etc - They make sense given a limited scope and timeframe. I agree that they'll miss out on some great Barristan scenes, but I guess they have a different direction in mind.

I still have a problem with the way some characters are portrayed. I feel the show really misses the subtleties of certain characters, mainly Tyrion and Littlefinger. The actors are great for both, don't get me wrong, but Tyrion is totally whitewashed and is missing his darker side. Littlefinger is portrayed almost comically evil, whereas in the books I feel he is more clever and not an obviously villain to anyone with half a brain.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What an asinine comment.

Major chain bookstores deserve their death - horrid selection of books, prices higher than Amazon, half the floor space dedicated to toys, board games, ereaders, and Starbucks.

Indie bookstores I am more sympathetic for, but more of them need to adapt. There is a pretty charming indie bookstore near me. Browsing their selection, I came across a used book I was interested in that they were selling for more than 40 bucks. I'm not asking for a price match, but a quick look on my phone showed multiple retailers selling it for $0.01 plus 4 bucks shipping.

If you are actually lucky enough to have a bookshop with fair pricing, an eclectic selection, and cool events like author readings, yes, you should probably support your bookstore if you are there often.

I am rooting for local bookshops in this time of ebooks/amazon/major chains, but the onus shouldn't be on me to support them if they refuse to adapt. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Let's be real here. I'm no stranger to gaming myself, and claiming that "you make all the decisions yourself" is painting with a bit of a broad stroke. There are very few games that allow you total or even partial freedom. Something like Mass Effect style choices are akin to choose your own adventure books, maybe even simpler. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't think there's anything wrong with enjoying YA novels - they can be entertaining and should be judged individually rather than as a genre. 

That said, I find it weird that some people choose to only read YA novels, and wear that fact like a badge of honor. Is there something to be proud of in only liking novels that are less challenging and more accessible?

	<TEXT> "As beautifully wrought and subtle and nuanced as some of these tales can be, they still largely tend to serve the function of propaganda, regardless of the authors intention. Even in condemning war, they end up romanticizing, glorifying, and legitimizing it on some level (often on many levels) and are added to a giant heap of stories that do the same."

Pretty much why I won't be bothering to read Phil Klay's book
