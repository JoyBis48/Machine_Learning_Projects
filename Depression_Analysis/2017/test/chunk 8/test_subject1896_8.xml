	<TEXT> Holy shit. This game was my JAM! My father passed away when I was four and one of the things he left behind was a Super Nintendo, this game (and others), and a black book with cheat codes. When I found it at 7 years old, it was like something out of a movie lol. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I used to perform this a lot. My best advice to you if you're worried about this is to either say something when it happens (like "Watch!") or snap with your other hand.


Also worth reminding: don't run when you're not being chased. Enjoy the Raven! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Update: they couldn't do anything. Here's my take away: know that the store (in this case ATT) cannot just give you a new phone. If it's in warranty, they'll have to send you to a special store that carries refurbished phones and has a center just for troubleshooting. If you're lucky, your store is close by and not 45min away like mine! </TEXT>

When you say shoo them, is it appropriate to pick them up and put them near the cardboard?
Also, when you say pen them up, am I using that as a punishment when they start digging?

	<TEXT> I used to work at Disneyland. The family was composed of 2 boys (about 7, 9), a mom, and a dad. I was working on the Jungle Cruise, driving the boat, and telling the jokes. 

One of the kids kept pulling down the throttle and another kept grabbing the gun (which, contrary to popular belief, is a real gun that has the capability of shooting real bullets, but we use blanks that can still fuck someone's eardrums or skin up). I repeatedly asked the parents to control their children as to stop fucking around with everyone else's experience. They kind of just said "Stop that" and kept taking pictures.

Finally one of the twerps took it a step further and shot the gun. I stopped the show and drove back to the dock, conferred with my lead before unloading, and had a manager and security meet us to escort the family out of the park. I didn't hear anything else from it.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Tales from a Disneyland Cast Member Ep. 1 </TITLE>

	<TEXT> So as the title suggests, I used to operate rides in Disneyland. I was there for a couple years and finally quit in February 2013.

I've had much more than my fair share of completely shitty guests. But the most common occurrence is when I'm at the "group" position and we ask how many is in your party so we can divvy y'all into rows and the person says "2" so I put them in row (let's say) 5 and that's the last row in the train so I hold the next group and that person says "OH BUT WE'RE WITH THEM!" (sorry for that monster sentence)

So one night, I was at Big Thunder Mountain and it was nearing the end of my Grad Nite shift (Grad Nite is a night for graduating seniors from all around SoCal to hang out in Disneyland with free reign from 10p-2a). A group of 6 really fat and loud students come up the stairs. The couple behind them scream from behind saying this group cut them. At Disneyland, we can't do anything about that unless we see, but believing them, I bring the couple out of line and reserve a special spot for them.
Now, I ask how many the students are. Not listening, I ask again. Finally, one of the people in the back hits the person in the front to acknowledge me.
"Haha what?"
"How many in your group?"
"2"
Here we go. Not trying to go through this turmoil and dually seeing an opportunity for some fun, I ask: 
"Are you guys 2 or all together here?"
"Oh we're all together."

So at Big Thunder, we don't have seats, we have rows that look like benches that are made to hold 2 adults or three children. But we're encouraged to pack the rows to three. 

"Rows 6 and 7."

I watch the 6 enter two rows and slowly watch them realize that this is going to be the tightest ride of their lives. Squeeeeeeeeeeeeeezing tight they finally managed to pull the lap bar down one click. We sent the train. When they came back it was like watching a clown car unload.

I gave the other couple who told me all about their problems in line a front row spot. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My father passed when I was 4. Now I'm nearly 20, and the only thing that lacks in retrospect was having someone to teach me the things my mom couldn't. 

See, when you're a single parent, you have to act as both parents. My mom tried, and for the most part, she succeeded. However, she couldn't teach me things like how to shave, for instance. How to fight, how to pick up girls (in a way), and general guy-to-guy stuff. But I wholeheartedly believe that having a single parent doesn't affect whether you can achieve excellence or not. </TEXT>
