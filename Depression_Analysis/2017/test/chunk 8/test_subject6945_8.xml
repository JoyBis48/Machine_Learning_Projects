	<TEXT> I know this will get burried but fuck it

I wad standing in the waiting room outside of the operating room while my partner was being preped for her C section.

It was abit suddern, the baby was breached, waters had broken so she was rushed into surgery 

I was given scrubs to change into so i could go in and be with my partner, but the 10 minutes i was waiting in this hospital ward with absolutly no one around ( it was 5am) was the most scared i had ever been. I had shit going through my head at a million miles an hour. 

But once they pulled him out and i heard that tiny little cry and saw him look at me everything just washed away. No more fear, no more worries. It was just him.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Buy an ohm reader before  you hurt yourself. 

Please just remove the battery and don't touch anything untill you do. Expecially  with mechanical mods as you have no way of knowing  whats happening. 

Edit: Then look up battery safety, no good knowing your resistance  if your battery can't  handle it. Maybe should  have started with that  </TEXT>
