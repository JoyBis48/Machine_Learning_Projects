	<TEXT> No offense, but your comment comes off as ignorant as shit. I assume you are white? You clearly don't understand the unequal job opportunities of African Americans in ANY profession, let alone head coaching in the NFL. How many black head coaches were there prior to this rule?? It clearly is working as they are now actually seeing opportunities. It's not forcing any team to hire these individuals. Its forcing teams to actually give them a look. 

Its not like you can just "get rid of the Rooney Rule."  Racism isn't dead, and old white owners usually need to be pushed in the right direction. Sorry, for this mini-rant, it just really pisses me off when people are ignorant of the incredible struggle for equality that is still being fought for by African American coaches. </TEXT>
