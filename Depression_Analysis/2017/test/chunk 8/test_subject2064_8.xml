	<TEXT> Can a man suffering from performance anxiety be forced into having an erection? No. However, that doesn't mean that another man who doesn't suffer from performance anxiety cant become forcibly aroused, nor that that man with said condition can't later overcome his anxiety, and later be forcibly aroused. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Performance anxiety and what you're describing as rape, are two completely different things. There's so much more to an erection than the want to have sex. Not to mention the fact that consent isn't as easy as black and white. Also, you're assuming that male rape is when a man has penal-vaginal intercourse with a woman. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Running Windows 7, using Adobe Media Encoder (problem occurs in CC 2014   CC 2015). Whenever I bring in an AfterEffects composition and render out a Quicktime file using the H.264 codec at 720p, it works fine. The problem is occurring when I try to render it out at 1080p. The render fails as soon as it starts, and the Error Log simply says "Error compiling movie. Unknown error." Why is this happening, and what can I do to fix it? </TEXT>
