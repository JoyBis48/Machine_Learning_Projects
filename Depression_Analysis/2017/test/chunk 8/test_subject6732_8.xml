	<TITLE> What are the best ways to write beautiful freeverse poetry? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-06-04 13:50:50 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm an aspiring novelist. But sometimes I just can't overlook the beauty of language that is presented in freeverse poetic pieces. I recently read Mary Oliver's *House of Light* and rejoiced a great deal of wordly beauty that those pages presented. And Tagore's *Gitanjali* is my all time favourite.

I too write some freeverse now and then, and also I was told by a few friendds of mine that I write short poetic stuff better than I write the regular blogs.

And also on Tumblr I sometimes witness beautiful stuff written by random people around the world. A recent one that I found and became a fan of is Jamie Oliveira. Her [cosmicroots](http://cosmicroots.tumblr.com) blog was splendid. Some of her works were simply sour stirring for me.

Experiencing all this beauty of language and words in shortly woven pieces, these days I'm tending to try out freeverse writing myself. 

What do you think are some of the ways in which I can improve my freeverse writing? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Just now I finished Mary Oliver's poetry (free verse) book, *House of Light*. It was a very pleasing read. It has some great touching lines:

*"There are many stories, more beautiful than answers."*

*"She does not work slowly, nor quickly, like a river."*

*"Its not size but surge that tells us when were in touch with something real."*

*"If the world were only pain and logic, who would want it?"*

*"Fear has not yet occurred to them, nor ambition."*

and my most favourite:

*"This is not a poem about a dream, though it could be.*

*This is a poem about the world that is ours, or could be."*


and many many more...

Now, I'm thinking of picking of Shelley's poetry soon. I just broswed a book or two of his and they appeared to be very promising free verses.

What are your favourite free verse poetry books?? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Harry Potter. Those 7 books are at the core of my heart and the way my morality in life is shaped. What else is so important for a person than his morale! Albus Dumbledore has taught me to always be humble no matter how powerful you become, and Harry taught me it is good to stay down to earth even if you're the most important person to many. Hagrid had taught me trust. The trio themselves had taught me the value of friendship... And above all, the Harry Potter series by J.K.Rowling has showed me that life can be magical and illuminating if one only remember to turn on the light. I'm indebted forever to Rowling. </TEXT>

Write another one.

 My friend said to find a website that I can post on and create a sort of portfolio on, but I don't know if that is a good idea.

That is. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  There are theories like the many worlds/multiverse theory where consciousness can sort of "jump" from one timeline to another causing memory discrepancies (or the "Mandela Effect"), but thats really just a fun guess.

I believe in all that shit.. It helps me cope up with this world's reality knowing that somewhere out there is another universe where I am achieving everything that I wanted to. So soothing! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've recently seen a post here that talked of Mandela Effect. Till that moment I've never heard of such an effect. When I learned about it, I felt thrilled and amazed at the same time. I'm an aspiring writer and now I want to know about these Glitch-causers. So, I request you all to please post in the comments some of the 'effects' (like Mandela Effect) that are discussed frequently in this sub.

Thank you :)

	<TEXT> I don't do anything. I just sit and listen to the book. I listen to audiobooks mostly when I feel like finishing more books in less time. Becaue I don't read fast.. so audiobooks are really a way for me to 'read more' in less time.. And also, when it comes to Malcolm Gladwell's books, I only listen to his audiobooks.. I like his narrating voice so much that I don't get the similar kick when I read his books by myself. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The light that comes out of screen when everywhere around you is pitchblack might actually harm your eyes and lead to headache. I use Kindle Paperwhite where I can regulate the light emission.. and ofcourse kindles are designed particularly for reading, so they've actually considered all of that eye sight thing.. If you're talking about reading on tablets and mobiles I would suggest to keep the light at the minimum so as not to affect your eyes. That is all. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah seriously.. That 'book inside a book' thing... it was literally the most dragging part of the entire thing.

At the beginning of the novel when the concepts such as *Thought Police* were being narrated, it was really interesting. And 1984 being a famous sci-fi novel (which it is goddamn definitely not), I was expecting something of a Hollywood level plot twist.. and then facepalm :/ </TEXT>
