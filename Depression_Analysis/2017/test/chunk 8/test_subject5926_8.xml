	<TEXT> Snipers Ultimate is now toggable and it works like frost arrows  
Shrapnel now damages tower and gets two more charges,  
it also goes trough backdoor protection and once the sniper is picked, whole mid lane is covered in shrapnel.   
Every1 who gets close to him start to hear gradually raising voice saying HOHO HAHA untill your game shuts itself.  
Also Headshot damage is getting nerfed !  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Man i feel for you , I just found out Im gonna get expeled out of year beacuse of not doing stuff i was assigned. I have no problem with my grades or anything, I m not being bullied I just cant get myself to do anything. Im just shutting myself in my room and spending most of my time sleeping and I cant find any reason to do anything. Sometimes I dont even get up to watch Tv and i just lay in bed the whole day. The worst part is when my dad found out and he told me that Im just fuckin my life, that i could have done it if i wasnt lazy. And i know he is right but I just cant...  
  
I wish you all the best, hopefully we can both manage somehow :) </TEXT>
