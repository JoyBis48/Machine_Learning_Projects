	<TEXT> Are you trying to say that /r/coontown and other subs like it need exposure in order to exist because that's not really true. Most of these controversial subs get most of their traffic through word of mouth. If users don't log in they can't vote, post, or comment so who cares about them. People who opt out of seeing this side of reddit will miss out on a lot more than just a few hateful subs. Most people will want to see at least some of that content so this isn't going to exclude enough people to directly kill any of those communities. 

This wouldn't necessarily hurt any subs, but it will allow reddit to isolate that content and sell ad space for better or worse.  </TEXT>

During this period, Robinson cultivated and maintained the outward appearance of a community-minded citizen and family man; he became a Scoutmaster, a baseball coach and a Sunday school teacher. In 1977 he talked his way onto the board of directors of a localcharitable organizationand forged a series of letters from its executive director to the mayor of Kansas City, and from the mayor to other civic leaders, commending his generous volunteer efforts and generally singing his praises. Eventually he had himself named the organization's Man of the Year, and threw a festive awards luncheon in his own honor.

He was an* accomplished fraud.  </TEXT>

Theres a victim in this case ... and sometimes the system stinks, Bartlett said.

Were very proud of the job we do here, and this is not something we take lightly, The sheriff added. I was extremely disappointed in his actions, and he will never again set foot in this building, unless he goes to jail.

Good on the sheriff for turning this dirt bag out on his ass. Hopefully he'll do some real time for this.

	<TEXT> So you don't have a source. 

Because what I'm saying is that Jim Crow laws were unconstitutional and once challenged they were thrown out by the applicable courts including SCOTUS. An attorney should not be telling anyone to break the law, but they can render an opinion on whether a statute is lawful and constitutional. In this case the SCOTUS has already determined the constitutionality of same sex marriage. Senator Cruz knows the law. He's not rendering an opinion, he's advising public employees to disobey the law which is very clear.  </TEXT>

Where those Jim Crowe laws upheld by the SCOTUS? Do you have a source that suggests they were? 

Because, from what I understand your hypothetical is the exact opposite of history. Politicians and lawyers were mostly supportive of the oppressive policies, or in other words, the exact same position as Cruz and friends. It took the Supreme Court to overturn those unconstitutional laws and the established powers were resistant to those changes.  </TEXT>
