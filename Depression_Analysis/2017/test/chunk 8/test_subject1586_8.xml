	<TEXT> God: My child, I use evolution to create that which I want to come into existence. Time is an operating principle of the universe that even I cannot escape. It takes time and intent to create. When you want to create something, you have to get the tools together and work with the materials to create that which you have imagined. I must do the same. So do not fear it there bones under the grass, or that there are stars above with the promise of other races. I have many pallets, and many tools and I take my time to make everything perfect. Because every creation I make is special, and important. Just like you. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I REALLY want to do this.

1: We Bark Together

2: Seattle

3: I cannot do international. I am a minister and my personal funds are way limited.

4: I am a vet of reddit secret santa, but I have not done Drafts for the Draft.

5: After getting really drawn into the craziness of the new Browns energy, I had to find a bigger community. Being a displaced Clevelander is hard. 10 years in ATL, and now I live (hopefully forever) outside of Seattle in the mountains. I am wearing a Browns shirt and orange shorts in San Fran in China Town as we speak.

	<TEXT> I was recently having a conversation with a friend of mine about this. He was upset that Trestman went to the Ravens. He was talking about how he should come home to the Browns, the history of Trestman in Cleveland, and eventually why we cant get those guys to come back. It finally hit me during that conversation. As much as I hate the Ravens when you ask the old timers to come back and help the Browns, their friends arent in Berea. When they think of the old times, they think of Ozzy Newsome and the staff of the Browns Pre-95. All of Trestmans friends from the old days are in Baltimore. One day we will be back to being a contender, but I fear that we wont ever be what we were. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I am going to get one more jersey before we change to the new style. I already have a Seal Brown '40' that was given to me with "Hillis" scraped off and my name stenciled on as a gift (First Jersey) I then bought a Seal Brown Cribbs '16' and a Seal Brown Haden '23'. I pretty much know that I want a Thomas '73'. The question is, do I want to go Seal Brown again, or do I go with my first White Jersey? 

I want the Seal Brown because I worry we wont have them next year, and I think I will still be able to get a white jersey next year. But I dont have a white jersey, yet, and I think Thomas might be really sick in White. 

Suggestions? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have heard from a buddy in Nebraska that he wasn't dirty at all in college and in fact had a large and positive following online. He surmised that there might be someone in the Lions staff that has coached him to play dirty. I don't follow middle America CFB, or the Lions, so I don't know. Just some insight. [Also, not everyone can be as cool as Spencer Lanning](http://imgick.cleveland.com/home/cleve-media/width620/img/browns_impact/photo/16359131-mmmain.jpg)  and that's something we just have to learn to live with. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am the most badass epic legendary neighbor. Here is my story:

I moved into the most beautiful neighborhood near Atlanta, GA. Historic Druid Hills across from Emory University. My house was perfect in so many ways. I had my own room with attached smoking porch, a gourmet kitchen, roommates that I loved, music, fun, parties, pets. It was perfect. Until 10pm every night. I lived next door to this horrible old woman and her 90 year old mother. We shared a driveway that split at the end into each of our yards. Once noise ordinance set in, the police calls would begin. It was a never ending, revolving door of police visit after police visit.

Listening to classical music and cooking a late dinner? Police. 

Laughing at a game of Apples to Apples and watching Craig Ferguson? Police. 

But the night that changed me was the night I came home from working 3 jobs at 11pm. I was, in this order, a Lumberjack, Mexican Restaurant Waiter, Gormet Pizza Chef for Everybody's Pizza  and my day started at 6am.

All I wanted was a milk shake. Sometimes all of life's problems can be solved, at least in the moment, with a milkshake. All of the sudden I hear the 3 hard knocks of an irate police officer. I answer the door holding the blender.

"Hello, Officer. What is it this time?

He points to my blender. 

"Your blender"

I must have looked at him in a really messed up way, because he gave me this 'Don't shoot the messanger' look with his hands up, and said

"Look. Just be quiet over here. I sat outside and you aren't doing anything technically wrong, but she is going to call us every time she hears you and we are 
going to have to respond"

So, being at the end of my rope, I asked a question. 

"What time does ordinance lift?"

"5am" he replied, and turned on his heel to leave. I nodded, closed the door, hand stirred the rest of my milk shake, went to bed, and set my alarm.

5am came slower than Christmas. Once my alarm went off I sat up, combed my hair, brushed my teeth, got dressed, and removed my trumpet from its case. 

*it should be mentioned here that OP played one quarter of a year of trumpet in 5th grade.*

I made my way out to where the split in our driveways began. Standing just on my side of the property, I faced her house, and began the most discordant, obnoxious, sonically discombobulating, racket I could muster. After a solid 2 minutes, the meanest, morning faced, most mad, vile, fist clenched, woman you have ever seen comes charging out of her house at me. I can tell that she has probably just gotten off the phone with the police, and has been informed that noise ordinance lifts at 5am

"STOP IT STOP IT STOP IT!!!! YOU STOP THAT RIGHT NOW"

At this point she is stomping and spitting and her hair is starting to unspring from her head, and I put my trumpet politely in her face and blow it as hard as I can while attempting to play as close to a 26/33 cadance as I can get. She runs back into the house and a few minutes later comes back outside. I like to imagine she called the police again to tell them what happened and they  politely told her to flake off, hung up the phone and laughed to each other about the field this lady was reaping from her actions.

Once again she beelines over to me and tries to take my trumpet. I pull it away and jut my face towards hers.

"If you touch my trumpet I'll have you arrested. You want to own the night. I own the fucking day"

And for a solid week my trumpets calls could be heard all the way to the CDC.

	<TEXT> The validity of this image aside, you should always remember that an information age is also a disinformation age. If this image were real, the image of the jet and missile could have just as easily been pulled from this picture, placed on a dummy site,  and then the SEO of the image optimized for search engines, program a bot to search and click the imagery hundreds of times to drive up the search relevancy,  and now it looks fake. Lotta work,  but if you are covering up a world wide incident... *shrug*  There are definitely people online paid to spread misinformation. They are most likely also on /r/Conspiracy. *EDIT: Spelling* </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think that this article nails it on the head. This front office/coaching staff is amazing. The movement to ManChild was perfect in its timing. We had enough time to see what he could do. Even after that shutout, the choice to play him again was the right decision. Connor Shaw was the correct decision for the Ravens. I'm more than satisfied with our infrastructure and the choices they have made. I trust, for the first time in modern history, that they will field the best decisions available to them. </TEXT>
