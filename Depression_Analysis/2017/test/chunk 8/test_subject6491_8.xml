	<TEXT> As a stock trader I can tell you one thing: You can't mix stock market opinions with political ideology. If you want to make money in the market, put your thoughts/beliefs/tribe aside during trading hours, and treat the market like a book to read from and your positions like a blank paper to write into. 

ZH never picked one of the two. So the results were 5 years trying to anticipate the next market crash that didn't happen. And when you are dead wrong for so long, you stop attracting reasonable people, and start pulling perma-bears and nut cases. Not because it's stupid to predict a crash (it's stupid to predict anything in the market), but because they predict using all the wrong reasons and sticking with it too long.

ZH best moments were when he/they put real inside information from the financial world. their downfall was that every inside story was accompanied by bad market crash predictions and ridiculous conclusions. 

So my stupid prediction is that when ZH  becomes completely  irrelevant or shuts down - that's when the bull market ends.  </TEXT>

That's true, but I think the X here implies some **minimal level** of education, healthcare, living income, water, infrastructure etc.

So they are not saying they want every American to have the same education, just that they want every American to have at least good education. If some can get more, good for them.  </TEXT>

Saying it's a "moral crisis" brings us back decades as far as understanding gay people. 

I personally don't think that it's a make or break for a president, but it's a sure one big minus. 

I also expect his position to turn if he wins the Republican nomination and moves to the national stage. There's no way he's going to stick with the moral argument on general election.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It costs lots of money because very few, if any at all, are issued each year. Almost all of the market is secondary (between old drivers to new) so prices go up. Taxi drivers are the first to object to issuing more medallions because they don't want more competition. 

In many cities there are few large taxi businesses which own all the licenses and they rent them to individual drivers. This way they maximize its usage (the license drives 24/7) and sees its value goes up due to lack of supply, which they fight hard to keep it that way. They are also in position to outbid any new player. Many banks will use the other medallions the business owns as a collateral for a loan for new medallion.

The second reason is interest rates. When interest rates are low, such as today, all yielding products, from bonds to real estates to medallions go up in price to adjust for lower return.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> From the book [AFFC, Ch6]: 

 Fear cuts deeper than swords, she told herself. Arya. She whispered the word the first time. The second time she threw it at him. I am Arya, of House Stark.

 You are, he said, but the House of Black and White is no place for Arya, of House Stark.

 Please, she said. I have no place to go.

 Do you fear death?

 She bit her lip. No.

 Let us see. The priest lowered his cowl. Beneath he had no face; only a yellowed skull with a few scraps of skin still clinging to the cheeks, and a white worm wriggling from one empty eye socket. Kiss me, child, he croaked, in a voice as dry and husky as a death rattle.

 Does he think to scare me? Arya kissed him where his nose should be and plucked the grave worm from his eye to eat it, but it melted like a shadow in her hand.
The yellow skull was melting too, and the kindliest old man that she had ever seen was smiling down at her. No one has ever tried to eat my worm before, he said. Are you hungry, child?

 Yes, she thought, but not for food

(tl;dr she was hungry, but not for food) </TEXT>

I also think that people underestimate the number of decisions an executive (in any business) makes in a week. That's why there's so much misunderstanding about CEO's pay. 

So yeah, someone might get right one show, but let that person decide on every show for few years, and he will probably drive the network to the ground. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As someone who worked a lot with dogs, I must say that he got the main idea. However, it's almost impossible to implement in real life, especially if the dog is trained to arrack (like k9). A more reasonable approach would be to give up the hand, there's nothing you can really do to avoid it. Try to minimize the distance, don't hit or kick (they won't feel anything anyway), and if you are close enough try to fall on the do and position yourself behind his head. If you fell on the ground and the dog isn't beneath you (most chances for trained dogs), you lost. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Out if curiosity I googled season 5 reviews, with 2 weeks time range before the premier. Top results that aren't fan sites: telegraph, frobes, independent, cnet and ew - can't say I'm surprised. Exactly where the current generation hangs out. io9 btw, reported from premier event in SF (probably 1-2 episodes?), which, again, makes much more sense than mass mailing shitty quality DVD. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not necessarily the largest and not necessarily bailout, but many do enjoy government's help. 

Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying their existence is depended on this help or that it's a big part of their survival. I'm saying that it does exist.

Here are top 10% names (rank below 50) from F500 (not the S P):

* J.P. Morgan (#18) - all banks rely heavily on Fed short term loans. The target interest rate is basically a guaranteed loan to the business which they can take and leverage other loans to retails at higher rate. Most banks on the list have this privilege. Also, specifically on JPM, the fire sales of BS during the 2008 was a government deal (backing up BS bad debt).  
Citi (#26) was obviously totally saved.  
BoA (#21) received $50B TARP + $100B losses cover during 2009.

* Verizon (#16), AT T (#11) and other networking companies enjoy shielding regulations and limited competition. 

* Exxon Mobil (#2), Chevron (#3), Valero (#10) and other oil companies do enjoy some nice specifics [tax breaks](http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/mt/assets/business/Oil_and_Gas_Breaks.JPG). Shell (#2 on the global F500 list) is also getting $1.5B tax break from Pennsylvania.

* Berkshire Hathaway (#4) - didn't take money directly, but some holdings did (GS (#74), BoA (#21), M T for example). You can probably add rail stimulus money to Burlington Northern.

* GE (#9) got government backup for $139 Billion of its debt. GE is also getting almost half a billion a year from different states.

* Boeing (#30) is getting $200M from South Carolina and another $100M from other states.

* GM (#7), Ford (#8) - $80B government help.

* Fannie Mae (#13) together with Freddie Mac (#32)  - huge bailout (takeover basically).

	<TEXT> The French director is Michel Gondry, who directed Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and also won an Original Screenplay Oscar on that film. 

The documentary, *Is the Man Who is Tall Happy?*, is nice, but it's mostly about languages and how they emerge. It's more of a conversation than a documentary, so it gets heavy and repetitive (so does the animation). Worth a shot by all means, but it's not a brilliant film.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Look, you are right by using 'demanding'. I never said someone wrongs you by not refunding.

 However, if I'm in a restaurant, the waiter asks me how's the food even after I'm done, and I say I didn't like it. It's a good and reasonable practice to suggest a replacement, offer desert or even not charge. Lots of restaurants will do that. Also, more importantly, lots of customers will not demand a full refund. I personally found myself in few situations where I didn't expect refund. Most people are reasonable. 

My point is: if you as a customer didn't enjoy your game, it's perfectly reasonable to ask for a refund. If you are a game developer, it's also reasonable to offer a refund.

The fact that you 'consumed' the experience got nothing to do with it.

 When I told Costco my printer didn't work afrer 3 damn years, they refunded me. And we all know the old printer is 'consumed' and probably going to the trash bin. It's a good and reasonable business policy. And gamers should know that. </TEXT>
