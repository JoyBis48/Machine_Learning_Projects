	<TEXT> I mean Davos. He's well-played and a compelling character, but it seemed like a bit of a cheat that he survived the wildfire explosion when he was so near he could see wildfire leaking out the back of the ship. With him dying, it seemed to give more resonance to the fleet being destroyed and it gave more of a human face to all the people that died in that scene. As is, the main character we've gotten to know who died at that battle was Davos's son, who was kind of one-note and unlikable.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Like, how did the Soviet news report on their involvement in Vietnam? Did they deny it on their news? Did they say "Yeah, we're doing all this and it's justified for the following reasons"? Did they have televised debates about things? If yes, we're they completely loaded debates?

	<TEXT> I'm not necessarily saying it's the deepest movie in the world, but when people praise Tree of Life (2011) for being like this really transcendent and the like, I assume they'd be able to explain why. But when I saw it, all I thought was "This is pretty! I like the music! That looks pretty too! Oh, this is moody!" I'm basically like a stoned six year-old when I watch that thing.

	<TEXT> I was just watching Interstellar with my brother and he described to me afterwards how towards the end, he was thinking "end! End!" I asked him if what was happening was bad or uninteresting or something, and he said no, but he just felt like the movie should be over. 

I really don't get people watching movies like they have to be film critics. I don't care if a scene doesn't drive the plot forward or if the "peaks and valleys" aren't timed out properly or whatever. I care how interesting the scene I'm watching is or if there's a likelihood based on previous scenes whether it will become interesting. That might say more about me than it does movies, but it just seems like caring about a movie's pace is just giving yourself a reason not to like it.  </TEXT>

I make a couple thousand off stuff I do online and have $30,000 saved up, but I've been worried it will all just crash and burn and then have to move back up here with a worse job.
