	<TEXT> In the United States there is no specific constitutional guarantee on the privacy of correspondence. The secrecy of letters and correspondence is derived through litigation from the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution. In an 1877 case the U.S. Supreme Court stated:

 No law of Congress can place in the hands of officials connected with the Postal Service any authority to invade the secrecy of letters and such sealed packages in the mail; and all regulations adopted as to mail matter of this kind must be in subordination to the great principle embodied in the fourth amendment of the Constitution. 

The protection of the Fourth Amendment has been extended beyond the home in other instances. A protection similar to that of correspondence has even been argued to extend to the contents of trash cans outside one's house, although unsuccessfully. Like all rights derived through litigation, the secrecy of correspondence is subject to interpretations. By Supreme Court precedent, rights derived from the Fourth Amendment are limited by the legal test of a "reasonable expectation of privacy". </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What if britain withdraws from the European Court of human rights?  This is exactly what the Tories are talking.

http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/oct/03/tories-plan-uk-withdrawal-european-convention-on-human-rights

You see your entire copypasta argument supporting guaranteed rights instantly falls apart.


In the US, the Bill of Rights is seen as a sacred text, with any violation intolerable. 

Also compare this to the UK government where the will legally justify mass surveillance 

http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/17/mass-surveillance-social-media-permitted-uk-law-charles-farr


So I'm certainly not the idiot here.  Top tip. Don't use copy pasta.

	<TEXT> While your OP   is certainly aired in jest, I honestly believe we are in the midst of history in the making. While trying to avoid buying into hype and grandeur, let me elaborate a moment.

We've all read some writings from Thomas Jefferson, Alexander Hamilton (this guy is a true hero), Ben Franklin, Thomas Paine, John Adams (no less a hero, ironically HATED Hamilton), etc on these very topics. Similar was their plight and equal was their discontent, though it would inevitably grow much stronger nearer the Revolution itself. Their established, respected government encroached upon their fundamental rights. It was nothing new then, it's nothing new now.

Having watched the video, I am unable to separate them it from those letters and well known quotables from patriots long gone. Granted, no one is asking for revolution, at least, no one of any sense. But the fact remains that one day these silly little sketches from from a silly show finding their way to a website like may find their way into the textbooks text-tablets of our grandchildren. Will they speak of an evil, failed coup to cripple the Government's (No doubt by then the word will carry a capital G while the word "god" will not) enforcement of the law? Or will they be the words of activists who fought for human rights against an overreaching body? 

For all of our sakes, for our children's sakes, I sincerely hope it is the latter. May changes to policy, and more importantly, the world's attitude towards these issues, come swiftly and peacefully.

Let me pre-empt the critics.  Yes  some are reluctant to compare Snowden to the likes of Jefferson and Franklin. Please do not misunderstand. I know it's a big jump, but I don't see it as immediately inappropriate. Americans hold certain historical figures up high as a manner of culture. They deserve our respect and gratitude, but in truth they were humans who spoke up in their times. They were farmers, business men, lawyers. Both sets (activists then and now) committed treason in the name of human rights, and that is to be respected.

Now, we do not need a new bill with his face on it or anything. My position is simply that these events and issues will undoubtedly be marked in history, and that Snowden has had no small part in it.   #NSALookAtMyDick may well be an important chapter and history in the making. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The trouble I find with that system is that it invites exceptions and conflicts

e.g. data protection act versus anti-terror legislation.

The American system isn't great but its simplicity seems better equipped for people to point to fundamental higher rights when making arguments.

Maybe a trained lawyer would have no problem describing the UK system but I get confused by it and don't find it empowering. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Virtually every single one of our international sports were invented or codified by the British. Ping-pong was invented on the dining tables of England in the 19th century, and it was called Wiff-waff! And there, I think, you have the difference between the British and the rest of the world. Other nations, like the French, looked at a dining table and saw an opportunity to have dinner; the British saw it as an opportunity to play Wiff-waff.   So yeah you may call me 'Murican but I know why we have table tennis and why it ain't no ping pong. </TEXT>

Now ask yourself - what if a country offers justice, justice in the form of a charter of liberties, allowing every man to forage for his hearth, to be safe from conviction without cause or prison without charge, to work, eat and live on the sweat of his own brow - and be as merry as he can.  That would be a free and land.  But it would require a royal decree. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> On December 2nd, 2013 a man was shot in Iceland by police officers after shooting two of them with a shotgun (both officers survived).  He was not killed immediately, but died in the hospital later, because the shot was meant to subdue him, not kill him.  The Icelandic police force publicly apologized to the man's family and offered counseling to the officers involved.  

This was the **first** person to be killed due to an armed police operation in **Iceland's history**.  </TEXT>
