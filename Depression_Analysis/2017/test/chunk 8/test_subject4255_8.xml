	<TEXT> You PM him/her over a period of months until you gain their trust. You find out that they actually live in the same city as you, in fact, just a couple of blocks down. You share pictures of yourselves with each other, slowly piecing together your independent lives. You find that you have similar interests including vast collections of fedoras, novelty swords, and NES cartridges. You muster up the courage to let them know you have feelings for them. You find that they share the same feelings towards you. You share more intimate photographs with each other leading into ending every night with a message in your inbox that says "Goodnight, I love you, I can't wait to meet you."

You decide to take the initiative and set up a date together. You invite them out to the local Hilton restaurant for a fancy meal followed by a night out on the town on Monday, April 20th, 2015 at 6:00pm Central Standard Time.

You wait until the eve of that fateful night and never leave your driveway.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah!

I was a little curious after the shampoo washed out of my hair, down my face, and into my mouth. It was very salty!  

Then I noticed that the shower gel is the same consistency! Naturally, I was curious about its taste so I tried it to compare. SAME FLAVOR, super salty!  

That's when I looked at the ingredients. They are the same!   

Yes, I could've skipped the second try but some minds work differently from others. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's because their last emperor's surname was Nguyen and it changing your family surname to match was respectful.

[Source](http://www.ibtimes.com/why-are-so-many-vietnamese-people-named-nguyen-1556359)

By the early 19th century century, the Nguyen Dynasty seized power in Vietnam (which unified the country), prompting yet another wave of surname changes and adoptions. That dynasty, which "awarded" their surname to many people, ruled the country until the end of World War II. Esther Tran Le, a Vietnamese-American journalist based in New York, said that the name Nguyen was the last name of the last dynasty of Vietnamese emperors. Apparently the last King's name was Bao-Dai, but his real name was Nguyen-Vinh-Thu, she said. Many of the Vietnamese [peoples] last names derive from the former Emperors' last names. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey Gordon!  

You should visit my town sometime and slap some sense into restaurant owners around here. I swear we are becoming the burger joint capitol of the work. I think we have at least 13 mom-and-pop burger places for our 40,000 people.  

A taco joint shut down and now someone bought the building and is turning it into ANOTHER BURGER PLACE...  

We have no diversity! It's all burgers or Latin American food!

Honestly, I'm not sure about the IP address. I would assume no. What I meant by that in the post is that there is a survey site we were considering that had an option to only allow one vote from one IP address. 

This poses an issue when it comes to schools and business. Effectively one vote can determine an entire school's opinion. We wanted to avoid that. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hello /r/gifs users! 

We've been receiving a lot of mod mail from you all regarding 'Power Users' (i.e. those who post content to /r/gifs 20-30 times a day). The complaint stems from other users' inability to submit content to our subreddit and collect the karma that these posts accumulate. 

We've decided to create a survey and let you all decided if we should enact a post limit for users. 

Please take five minutes out of your day to answer! There are two  questions that are mandatory and the rest are silly questions we've come up with to get to know our user base a little better.

The survey is open for all to submit answers to but **PLEASE ONLY SUBMIT IT ONCE**. We had the option to use a feature that only allows one vote from an IP address or allows only users with a Google account to vote BUT we decided that these features would hinder our users' votes. 

**[LINK TO SURVEY](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1otfolOwCvjhUVtLo8lwvO5z3iZGWjkCm43b2XrMqIy8/viewform?usp=send_form)**

Thank you so much for your participation in this community and survey. It means a lot!

Sincerely,

test_subject4255

EDIT: I guess I should have mentioned a date at which the polling ends. How about a week from today? 

Polling ends 4/23/2015 at 12:00pm Central Standard Time. 

EDIT 2: **POLLING HAS ENDED. RESULTS WILL BE GIVEN SOON** </TEXT>

	<TEXT> [REQUEST] GTA V


I know. It's posted as a request nonstop. Let me tell you why I'm different! I'm not.

I just simply don't have the money to purchase a game that I know I will enjoy. I've been a huge fan of the franchise and put a lot of hours into GTA: San Andreas when I had it for Xbox. I never really appreciated GTA: IV because I'm a big fan of flying airplanes and I feel like Liberty City is confined.

San Andreas has been my favorite one out of the series because of its size and GTA: V is the closest sequel that mimics it. I want to rob stores, steal fighter jets, take flying lessons, etc. and I know this game will offer it all to me.

Plus, my SO would be ecstatic considering we first connected with her love of driving down sidewalks.

Thank you for considering me.

If you just try and realize what conditions need to be like for you to willfully take the life of endangered species maybe you'd see that it's probably not what they want to do but is what they must do in order to survive.

On the same note, there is a market for what they do. If you destroy the demand the supply will go with it. This is something that the Chinese government is trying to work on. </TEXT>
