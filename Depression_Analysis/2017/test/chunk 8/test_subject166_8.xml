	<TEXT> Conservatives hated the student protests of the 70's, and they blamed the professors for teaching liberal ideas.  They systematically worked (and there could be multiple ways to do this) to increase the costs of studies to restrict enrollment in schools and  to keep students and graduates so indebted that they would stop liberal arts studies and wouldn't have time to protest social injustices anymore.  They also worked to stop professors from getting tenure (where they could say what they believed without threat of losing their jobs) to adjunct professors who could not even support themselves any longer. </TEXT>

Also paying $100 to each person giving a referral and $200 to that person if the new employee stays 6 months.

	<TEXT> The RJ had an article a while back giving 50-50 odds that it will dry up by 2021.  I've seen some photos of the lake near Sacramento that is dry, and Lake Shasta is also dropping fast.  One hope is that we have a good El Nino this year.

	<TEXT> I watch jobs as they come out.  I have seen a bartender apprenticeship job advertised in the past week - not sure if it was through MGM properties or Stations, but keep trying.  You usually have to start as a bar back.  There is a bartender's union also.  Not sure if they are accepting new members, but it might be worth a call to check them out or to see what they recommend.  This is not a job, but the best I can think of right now. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I read about the group out of Washington DC (Mt Pleasant) that started a buyers coop and with tax rebates, were able to get the price down to 1500 per house. I live in LV too. Don't think there are any tax rebates available today, but I'm sure we could do better.  We ought to brainstorm.  I couldn't find the original article but saw a newsletter that said it should cost from 5000 - 7000 now per house. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It is getting tough.  We had a doctor tell my husband he needed surgery when he needed a dentist.  I've had dentists tell me a group of my teeth needed to be taken out - and years later, I still have the teeth.  There is a book called "Trust me - We're Experts" about how lawyers bring in experts for both sides who contradict each other - for a fee.  There is always someone in there for the cash.   I try to look for friends or knowledgable people who are not looking for gain for guidance. </TEXT>
