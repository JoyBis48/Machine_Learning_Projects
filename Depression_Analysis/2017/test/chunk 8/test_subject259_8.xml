	<TEXT> Meat is different colors due to the muscle useage in the animal. Dark red muscle is used for endurance type activities, while pink muscle (white meat) is used for burst movement. Since cows do a lot of standing and walking (endurance) they are red, and chickens dont fly often and therefor are white (needed for a fast escape). The color is due to a protein.
