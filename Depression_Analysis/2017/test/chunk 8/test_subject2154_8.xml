	<TEXT> Let me go through point by point:

 There has [sic] been little to no rumblings regarding Sosh since the 02 run

Wrong. He was on the hot seat as recently as last year. Then he went and led the team to 98 wins and that talk died out.

 The tenure of players like Blanton   Frieri

Both of whom were in the positions they were in largely due to a lack of organizational options. Frieri was good for awhile here, and people hailed him as the bullpen savior. Then he went sour, and naturally people wanted him out. Sosh would've put someone else out there if he'd had good options. He didn't, so out Frieri went again.

Blanton was the same way. You really think Sosh would've kept running him out there if he had other options? He absolutely did not have other options. Blanton was worth trying, solely because the alternatives were just as miserable.

 the absolute stop light to the running game

One thing Sosh does not get nearly enough credit for is managing to his current roster. Sosh likes to run, it's well-documented. You know why he doesn't run with this squad? Because it's not a team that's equipped to run. Trout is the only guy with plus speed, and thus is the only guy who steals bags. You really want him sending guys like Aybar, who is not a good base stealer, just to say he has the running game going? No, you'd complain about how he sends runners when he shouldn't, and how that's a good reason for him to be fired.

Sosh teaches base running very well; his teams' track record will prove that. This just happens to be probably the worst running team he's ever managed. And we still go 1st to 3rd and score on sac flies quite well, given how slow our team is.

 A Yankees payroll of players

Take that up with Tony Reagins and Arte. Those two are directly responsible for every huge deal we've thrown at someone during Sosh's tenure with the exception of Trout (whose deal I hope you don't take exception with or I'm wasting my time here completely)

 He's the longest tenured manager in baseball   his team's [sic] have regularly fallen short of expectations for 10 straight years

Wrong. Wrong wrong wrong. Last year's team was not even on anyone's radar as best team in baseball. Most people had us out of the playoffs. We've had a huge amount of success under Sosh. The only stretch that can be construed as otherwise is the 5 years between 2009 and 2014 where we missed the playoffs, and that was largely due to an extremely competitive AL West, transitioning between core groups of players, and some really bad contracts that hampered our flexibility. 

The thing managers should get credit for, above all else, is maintaining clubhouse morale and cohesiveness, as well as managing playing time and the pitching staff without egregious errors. Sosh has done this to a T since he's been here. Whenever he's had a bullpen to work with, he's used it like a scapel. I'm stoked we have him as our manager. There's a reason he's the longest tenured skipper in the bigs, and has been around longer than all the managers in the AL Central combined. But hey, if you want to end a good thing, by all means. Call for his head. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would imagine it has something to do with unions being made up of lots of people, and thus having a better claim to wielding a large influence. Whereas the Koch brothers are two dudes, and only claim to represent their own interest.

Basically, the unions' level of influence is based upon their large memberships, so they can claim to speak for a lot of people; the Kochs speak only for themselves, but have a wildly disproportionate amount of influence for being only 2 people.

	<TEXT> As a counterpoint to some of the people ITT claiming suicide is selfish and unforgiveable: 

People pontificate, "Suicide is selfishness." Career churchmen like Pater go a step further and call in a cowardly assault on the living. Oafs argue this specious line for varying reason: to evade fingers of blame, to impress one's audience with one's mental fiber, to vent anger, or just because one lacks the necessary suffering to sympathize. Cowardice is nothing to do with it - suicide takes considerable courage. Japanese have the right idea. No, what's selfish is to demand another to endure an intolerable existence, just to spare families, friends, and enemies a bit of soul-searching.

	<TEXT> Middle of the infield has more ground to cover, so it's considered more demanding than the corners. As a result, they get more balls hit their way, or into areas where they're the one who needs to make the play.

2B is considered easier than SS largely because of the arm question. The throw is much shorter, so you have more time to throw and you don't need as strong of an arm to be able to record outs.

Basically, shortstops need both a strong arm (for the longer throw, like the 3B) and a greater range (because they have more ground to cover, like the 2B) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The comments made by the agent make it seem like Hornacek was contacted directly, which isn't allowed and thus forced Hornacek to refuse the request or be in violation of his contract. 

Which would make sense with a lot of what people are saying about Pollard liking Otz and not wanting to do a real coaching search. He may have torpedoed his chances with Hornacek on purpose. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A healthy Miggy might have beat him again, which is where I disagree that Miggy should've beat him in the first place. But without Miggy, it's not even an argument. Just because it was Trout's weakest year doesn't mean he wasn't the MVP. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Bryce Harper will end up being a much better player than Mike Trout, who won't win another MVP

I disagree with you, but respectfully. You're not right, and you're not wrong either

 Michael Brantley should have beaten him last year

Aaaand some opinions are unpopular because they are flat out wrong, like claiming the Moon landing never happened. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am honestly happy that Galarraga's perfect game got taken away on a blown call. 

To me, Galarraga threw a perfect game. Everywhere except the record books will acknowledge that (and I guess some weird sticklers for technicality).

But the grace and forgiveness that Galarraga showed to Joyce, a man who clearly felt terrible about an honest mistake, was incredible, one of the noblest things I've seen. It gives me tears to think about, and it's the kind of thing I want to be able to show my kids as an example one day. One of the best moments of humanity in a game full of them. Galarraga has my utmost respect forever, because of how he conducted himself in that situation. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Glad I can pay it forward! I went to Fenway for the first time last Sunday when the Angels were there, and despite the fact that we lost, I had an incredible time. Great ballpark, and the fans went out of their way to be friendly and considerate and engage in good-natured banter while simultaneously talking about how good Trout was and all that..seriously made the experience even better, blew me away. So thank you! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't think you'll regret it!

Let me clarify though, it doesn't explicitly deal with death. It centers on an old man whose life is clearly winding down, and the existential questions that come into play with that. It got me thinking about death, but more accurately it's about the end of life (in part; there are other things at work obviously. It's a fantastic piece of literature). </TEXT>
