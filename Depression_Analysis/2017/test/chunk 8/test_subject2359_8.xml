The U.S. has about three times as many combat aircraft, so a higher raw number of accidents is to be expected.  

The *rate*, however, of attrition of Russian aircraft should be worrying to the Russian Ministry of Defence, given how slow both their upgrade (of Soviet-era equipment) and procurement (of new aircraft) programs are right now. </TEXT>

And who said anything about denying?  Anyone of any age is generally all right (barring age restrictions, like for pornography) to read whatever they want in their free time.  Saying a child can't be taught a book in school isn't the same as saying they can't read it otherwise.

No ... no, it isn't.  Religious texts *shouldn't be used for instruction* in a public school.  That's what I'm getting at.  

What other books would you disallow 6th graders from reading? Using your own criteria, couldn't "christian fundamentalists" choose 1000 books to burn on the pyre? Using your own logic of course.
