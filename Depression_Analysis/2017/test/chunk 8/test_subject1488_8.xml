	<TEXT> I love working with my hands, putting things together, doing arts/crafts, etc. I need something new, something I can pick up fairly quickly with a little bit of research, and that will MAKE ME MONEY. Some crafts can be sold online but ETSY is oversaturated. I was thinking of making computers but I think that is something I wouldn't get the hang of, plus it cost a lot of money. I'm broke, my job isn't paying, and I do nothing all day, everyday. 

If you know a better sub that could help, please direct me! thanks!! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I just wrote this long response but it got deleted. Basically, yes it does take a while to build up but for me, its different than cymbalta or something. I can tell which days I do or don't take it, and recognize its effects. Other than Xanax, there is a very popular pill (I think a benzo) that is nonaddictive and often prescribed because of this. I can t remember its name off the top of my head but you can search for it and do your own research. Allergy pills can affect your brain like Xanax, so it could be used as a quick fix.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah I love that they care and ask me if i need I talk but the only people that understand are people that have gone through it or are currently struggling. Everyone knows my dirty laundry, but not it's extent.

Giving you advice would be hypocritical fit me because I'm stuck in this cycle as well. I don't care about anything including myself and gave up on getting better. You need someone, done meds, and to push yourself to make memories and do things. 

Also, having a drink is fine, everyone gets through the day in their own way, but it's a depressant. Alcohol makes me want to kill myself and everyone I know that has depression (not many open people) feels worse when drinking. Just food for thought. Msg me if you'd like to talk. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Any antidepressant will have people that say good or bad things about it. It depends on the person and what they respond to, and other factors in their life. I'm on it now and gets me out of bed, no anxiety, but makes me feel nothing. But, in a way I'm back to my old self, as far as personality. It's the best out of the 3 I have tried, but do not feel happy at all. I was prescribed welbutrin in addition for energy and getting my emotions back but I feel it makes things worse and stopped. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Mingle with your coworkers. Even if you don't love them, it's still is something to do, they can introduce you to people, force you to get out, and improves morale. Be friendly with your neighbors in your apt and see if they're your age. Go to a bar, even if you don't drink, and talk with the bartenders. It will help with the loneliness. Join a gym and see if they have classes and you may meet someone. If you tell them your new they may assist you and will give you something to do. All these things will ease loneliness and make you feel at home. Maybe volunteer a day or two a week somewhere like a music venue or something you're into. </TEXT>
