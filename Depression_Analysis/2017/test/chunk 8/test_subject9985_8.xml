	<TEXT> It's pretty tiring to be mindful at all times, but it's useful to be able to identify when you're going through a stressful situation and become mindful at that point. 

Also it's pretty great to become mindful when you're in a relaxing situation like sitting on the beach - everything becomes that little bit more satisfying.


Oh, and sex. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I watched a documentary once about how the drug testing system works. You have to tell them exactly where you're going to be at all times, days in advance. I think one of the people interviewed said they had to work out where they'd be on certain points of their long-distance runs.

I'm surprised this doesn't happen more often. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've read the power of now and whilst I appreciated it, I feel it can be a bit intense and "out there" for some people. Instead I'd recommend The Untethered Soul by Michael A Singer, I find it's a lot more accessible and also is structured in a far more logical way. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The difficult truth is that you need to stop yourself thinking these thoughts. It's something that I've had to do myself and I know that it's immensely difficult. But this sort of thinking becomes a habit and it will become worse and worse if you don't take a stand now. 

From your meditation you've hopefully gained an awareness of what's going through your mind, you need to use this awareness as much as possible to identify these bad thoughts.

The next (and most difficult) step is to take a leap of faith and stop letting yourself think these thoughts. I know how difficult this is, and part of me was scared that I wouldn't be "prepared" for bad eventualities if I did this. However, taking this leap of faith will set you free completely.

When things get tough, think of it as habit training. You've trained yourself into bad thinking habits, you can train yourself out of them too.

Good luck! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't believe in God in a traditional sense, but I'm open to the idea that there could be something out there akin to a God. It could have personality flaws, it may not be powerful enough to be aware of everything it created, hell, it may even be that our universe is a kids toy to teach baby aliens the meaning of life and death.

I simply accept the idea that there are so many things that I will never understand and maybe a God would be one of those things. </TEXT>
