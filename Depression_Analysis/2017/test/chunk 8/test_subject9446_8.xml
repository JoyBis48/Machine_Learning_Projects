	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm attempting the "Path Based Access Control" lesson on WebGoat, but when using Burp as a proxy I'm not able to use WebGoat. Any attempts to load a page (before or after intercepting) result in the following errors in Burp:

"Timeout in transmission from localhost"
"Timeout in communication with remote server"

All other webpages work just fine. I'm only having this issue with WebGoat on localhost. My configurations are below:

- WebGoat is running on localhost:8080
- Burp Proxy is configured to listen on 127.0.0.1:8081
- Firefox is configured to use the Burp proxy.

I've spent several hours Googling and tweaking the configurations, but I have not been able to get it to work. Any help would be appreciated. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> My parents are anti-vaccinations, and I've been trying to educate myself on the matter so that I could address and potentially counter their concerns knowledgeably.

I know Reddit is quite pro-vaccine, and I hear all the time about the flawed and debunked autism-vaccine study. I watch Penn and Teller's Bullshit episode on vaccines, and I see people "poo-poo" any casual connection between vaccines and autism.

But then I come across a site like [this](http://adventuresinautism.blogspot.com/2007/06/no-evidence-of-any-link.html), and I become confused. It appears to be heavily cited, with over 60 papers and studies that present a connection between various types of vaccines and ADS (austism spectrum disorder).

There seems to be misinformation on this topic everywhere, and it can get a little overwhelming. Reddit, can you help me sort out fact from fiction, speculation from science?

*EDIT* Whoops, forgot to include link

	<TEXT> This is great, thank you! I'm not one to take a blogger or even a study at face value, but I sometimes have a difficult time taking apart the research process like you did.

And those are great resources, I'll definitely be bookmarking those for thorough reading :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I understand, but even if we assume that one is completely safe (which isn't the case) that's only a single vaccine. There are studies linking autism to the Hepatitis B Vaccination, for example.

I guess I'm just wondering if vaccination simply becomes a question of risk tolerance? "Am I okay with with the rare but possible side effects of this vaccination?" </TEXT>
