	<TEXT> Superman being pragmatic *is* plot Armour though, because superman doesn't act that way, ever. He would try to reason with his oldest friend, try to talk, try not to kill him ect. And the last time he tried to fly batman into space, he just spat kryptonite gum into supes eyes. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Nope, because if batman was really playing for keeps, he would just shoot superman with a magic, kryptonite bullet from 1000 feet away, that travels back in time and kills him whilst he was still a baby.

Comicbooks are inherently unrealistic, and Superman is *definitely* not OP, especially for the DC universe. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I kind of disagree that DC has been progressive lately. The new 52 and other stuff slightly before it got rid of a lot of diversity in comics, particularly related to the bat-family and stuff. IMO, this was because DC took a while to realize that modern comics are essentially speculator scripts for films and TV, and should only really worry about influencer media. </TEXT>

I beat manus first time. Without getting the other lord souls first

Now, I know what you're thinking, another smug post where a guy talks about his L33t skills or whatever, but the way I beat Manus wasn't really through any sort of trickery of OP weaponry or anything. I just used the 15 free full health potions given to me in the room before, that is, humanity. Because Manus isn't the most high damage, aggressive boss, (at least, compared to say, Artorias or the chuckle brothers) I basically beat him through shear perseverance and the health regen of those sweet humanities. My question is why this tactic isn't considered for noobs having a tough time compared to, say, shooting arrows through the boss door? I mean, why is just gobbling up that humanity the average player has mostly collecting dust not considered? Why is this cheesy tactic considered lower on the priority list than every other cheesy tactic? </TEXT>

(just look at a lot of the death videos on the sidebar of the video) Whilst the whole thing of showing those deaths making you want to 'protect' Lara can be criticised, gory deaths are basically a tomb raider staple. If you wanna check out a really bad sexualised death in a game, check out Heavy rain, where the female lead is strapped up, and the player can choose to *let her get power drilled through the vagina* </TEXT>

Tb attacked both over the yogventures debacle and the yogdiscovery programme (a method of paid promotion), the criticism caused Lewis Brindley, the 'head' of the yogscast, to make a very disparaging reddit post about TB's apparent hypocrisy.

	<TEXT> Well, American animations such as Simpsons, south park, Futurama and Family Guy have had queer relationships pretty much since their inceptions, and you also have a fair amount of stuff in weirder kids cartoons, that can arguably been seen as as explicit. (Ren and Stimpy and stuff) And technically, batman TAS introduced a gay character (Renee Montoya) and had a lesbian relationship (which was later confirmed in comics) in the poison ivy/ Harley Quinn thing. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You're never going to have a truly meritocratic awards show about a subjective art medium, the best hope is to acknowledge as many films deserving of awards as possible. Sure, a Japanese anime will never win best picture, but at least it can get acknowledged in some format, hence why people want a 'best stunts' category, the best action film of the year will never win anything otherwise. </TEXT>

I feel that the premise of ten martial arts masters fighting one Kung fu grandmaster is lost in order to show how badass ip-man is, and it lacks directorial flair (why is the last guy just another mook? he's on his own after seeing ip man beat everyone else, surely he would react differently?) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's a disservice to the animated medium. The clone wars show was completely independent of Episode 3, and George noticeably changed grievous representation from the cartoon. It also had far *far* superior direction and fight sequences to episode 3. (the attack on Coruscant is better than everything in episode 3) f George Lucas actually was influenced by Anime, he would have probably used more camera angles than two for every dialogue scene. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Exactly. Games developers are, as far as I'm aware, all pretty liberal, and almost every game other than really obviously sexist stuff (like duke nukem forever) usually have issues of 'sexism' that are debatable. ("that's optional, that's a playable character ect) Which is why I find praise of good imagery preferable to critiques of supposedly bad imagery. I don't doubt the industry should improve artistically, I just doubt FF's videos explaining in a sentence why dozens of games are sexist are the best way to do so, and tend to trigger incediary reactions from people who are fairly moderate. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Or that developers are just *lazy*. I think most examples of the damsel in distress trope portrayed in games is due to not wanting to bother making a story, and using basic stereotypes (I.E Arthurian romance) to create a situation that universally translates, such as the princess is locked in a castle etc. </TEXT>

Which is the same isolationist, fatalistic approach to games that keeps companies making poor quality games, because the people who play super-creative, well made games are discouraged from talking about them to 'casual' relatives. </TEXT>
