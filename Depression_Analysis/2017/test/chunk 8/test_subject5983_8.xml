The other news videos just seem redundant to me and I don't care about any of the nerd stuff, and the cheesy format is off-putting to me. 

Oh well, I don't care enough to unsub or anything, but I only watch probably 10% of what they put out compared to the 90% or so that I used to watch with the original bunch.  </TEXT>

Sorry. I didn't genuinely laugh once and I didn't care about anything that was happening or any of the characters. Above that, I thought it was boringly written and I thought Bautista, Saldana, and half the other characters did a cheesy job with already cheesy enough lines. I love Pratt in Parks   Rec, Cooper in everything, and I like James Gunn as a director. I was really looking forward to it. In the end, I didn't even appreciate it as a fun, cheesy, space-opera. Maybe I'm heartless. I'm guessing y'all will think I am. </TEXT>
