	<TEXT> It is insane though because they will be all in with still half their stack. It isn't as if they're down to 4 BBs. They will still have a lot of chips to play with but shove every.single.time. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> At the end of the day, it remains speculation until we know for sure AND you're right, it all leads to Christ's return anyway. But I wouldn't say it's not worth wondering about. God included it in His Word for a reason, you know? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I know different sects of Christianity carry separate opinions on who or what the Anti-Christ and False Prophet are, but I was curious to hear some separate ideas. This post was inspired by another this morning concerning the End of Times. So, in being respectful with each others' views, what is your take or interpretation? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't know if people are genuinely unable to hold their tongue or if it is an attempt to tilt players, but the amount of name-calling and insulting is astounding. Anyone have any insight into the major motivation of trash talk? Or, if you talk trash yourself, why do you do it? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would speak to a pastor about this issue. Jesus calls it adultery, but then so is looking at a woman with impure thoughts. Who isn't guilty of that? I would say if she is a believer, you're probably okay, but seek wisdom through prayer and the council of wiser men than myself.  </TEXT>
