	<TEXT> I don't think the FSU fans on the sub is that much of a difference. For starters, we have a quarterback that is absolutely hated by the sub (see [comments like this](http://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/2jny8u/post_game_thread_2_fsu_defeats_5_notre_dame_3127/cldgba4),) so right away the people we want to succeed are getting run through the mud by the masses. Additionally, there are a *lot* of people here who think we don't even deserve to be in the playoffs because of the way we played; something FSU fans disagree with. Those two factors working in concert have given rise to a back-and-forth of persecution complex and actual persecution between the FSU fans and everyone else.  

I think at the end of the day you have to decide the value of "quality wins", or how you look doing it, versus the fact that *you are simply winning.* We can all agree that in marshall's case the former clearly outweighs the latter, and in Oregon's case the latter outweighs the former. FSU is a pretty tricky middle ground though, because they've faced a decent but not too difficult overall schedule and have won unconvincingly, but the loss column is still the best in the country. Deciding which one is actually more valuable is a pretty impossible task. 

I side with FSU fans obviously, in thinking that even when we have a down game (or 6) and are dealing with injuries (11 starters missing time so far this season), managing to end up with the win anyways for 11 straight games is still an immensely value trait to have; and it's something no other P5 has been able to do. I definitely don't think we're the best team in the country, but I do think we're the hardest to beat. 

I think writing FSU off as lucky is extremely unfair. Nobody thought Auburn didn't deserve to be in the championship game because of that miraculous touchdown against Georgia, or the kick-6. I don't see why we shouldn't get the same benefit of the doubt. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Fun little tidbit: As of this past weekend, there is almost a three-way tie for the most wins of the last 25 years. School records for 1990 to present are:

Nebraska: 238-78-1  
Florida:   237-77-1  
Florida State: 237-67-1

There are a lot of scenarios that could play out for the title. For instance, the UF/FSU game will probably decide who takes the lead between the two Florida teams. If Florida State makes it to, and wins, the national championship they could win outright; unless Nebraska makes it to, and wins, the the B1G and their bowl game. Nebraska has a tough final two games, and if they lose out Florida could take the lead by upsetting FSU. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I mean... maybe. As far as potential quality wins left on the schedule, a win over Ole Miss will probably look better than any of TCU's remaining wins, and whoever OSU ends up playing in the B1G championship game. Considering Miss St already has ground on both of them in the eyes of the committee it'll come down to what value a conference championship actually holds, but if I had to, I would definitely take MSU over both of those teams. </TEXT>

You'll probably have more impressive wins than most of them by the end of the year, but you also have two very bad losses. You probably need 2 of them to lose to be in. If both Bama/MSU win out and you defeat Bama, then MSU would still probably go over you guys as well. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think us being ahead of TCU, with a much stronger remaining schedule AND a championship game against a presumably ranked team means that there's about 0% chance we fall out of the top 4 by going undefeated. If ASU jumped us it would be at the expense of beating Oregon, and I think there's basically no chance of tOSU or Baylor climbing ahead of us either.

Ironically enough, I would actually love to see Alabama beat Miss St., and Oregon win out, and us take the #4 seed over the #2/3 seed, because we'd fair much better in NOLA 5 hours away from Tally than at the Rose bowl. Or just taking the #1 seed would work too. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Honestly I would say he's simply gotten better as a coach during his tenure. We probably had the talent to go 12-2 his first two years as coach, and a team that should have gone 13-1 in 2012 (no way we were beating you guys the way EJ played), but his ridiculous conservativism held us back big time offensively; he's shown some really smart playcalling ability these past two years and he's definitely a huge reason we're 22-0 these past two seasons. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Minnesota's last three games are against Iowa (6-2), Wisconsin, Ohio State, and Nebraska. There's a good chance they finish 7-5 or worse and are not really considered a needle-moving quality OOC win.

I hear you though, I think you guys are the better team for sure and are much more likely to make it, I was just responding to the post above that you guys aren't 100% safe as a Big12 playoff invite even if you win out. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I mean if Baylor wins out, they'll have a comparable schedule of good wins (one more better win, against you guys, once worse loss, against WVU), and I would imagine having the conference championship would be the tiebreaker in the committee's eyes. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In no particular order, I think it will be:

1. Oregon - Survives Stanford, cruises through the final three games, and with a healthier O-line beats whichever Arizona team makes it to the Pac-12 championship game.

2. Kansas State - despite all three remaining tests being on the road, being the one elite big-12 team with very good defense allows them to win out.

3. Notre Dame - I think not falling very far after the loss to FSU benefits this teams greatly, and they make it by winning out. 

4. Georgia - For the SEC West, I'm predicting Auburn to lose to UGA but beat Alabama and Ole Miss; Alabama to beat Miss. State and LSU but lose to Auburn; Ole Miss to lose to both Miss. State and Auburn. That leaves Miss St. (who otherwise wins out) the SECw champion at 11-1 and all other teams with at least 2 losses. I think Georgia will beat Miss St. in the SEC championship game and is the only SEC team to make it because no other SEC team ends the season with only 1 loss. (Yes, I realize predicting that many games is ridiculous)

I think Florida State's shady offensive line and lack of run game will collapse against one of the best defenses in the nation this Thursday, and they lose to Louisville and are out of the playoff picture. I'm also predicting Ohio State to win out and beat Michigan State, but with a weak SoS and a bad loss, they end up being one of the one-loss teams on the outside looking in. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The thing with Tobias is that he's way more of a wildcard than Vuc. We, for the most part, know Vuc's floor as a player. Tobias varies between looking like a career backup worth $4m a year, and a career 19/8/3 guy worth max or near-max. I honestly don't even know what I would extend him for; 4/40 maybe? I can definitely see why he's going to be a bit more polarizing in extension talks. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I actually don't think they would. FSU has no ranked teams left on the schedule, so I don't see them getting a win that will launch them back into it. I expect at least one sec west school to finish with one loss and not win the division; and/or Georgia to be in if they win the SEC. Assuming FSU loses, two spots for SEC schools is a very likely scenario. 

With two spots left, I think Notre Dame, Oregon, Baylor, Kansas State, Michigan State, and *maybe* Ohio State would all pass them if those teams run the table, and I think the odds of 5/6 of them lose another game would be pretty slim. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> In the last 30 years Florida State football is #1 in the nation (outright or tied) in the following categories:  
winning percentage overall  
winning percentage vs major conference teams  
winning percentage vs top 25 teams  
winning percentage vs final top 25 teams  
winning percentage vs final top 10 teams  
wins by double digits  
blowouts (20+ point wins)  
bowl appearances  
bowl victories  
Top 25 finishes  
Top 10 finishes  
Top 5 finishes  
wins vs bowl teams  
wins vs 10-win teams  
wins vs the SEC Champion  
wins vs the (eventual) National Champion  
total wins  
Heisman winners  

Florida State also has, by far the longest streak of top-5 AP finishes (14) and top-4 AP finishes (13). The second longest streak was Pete Carrol's USC at 7 for both.

Extending it out a little bit, Florida state is also reaching the all-time bowl appearance streak, currently at 32, and only behind Nebraska 35 (1969-2003) and Michigan 33 (1975-2007) </TEXT>
