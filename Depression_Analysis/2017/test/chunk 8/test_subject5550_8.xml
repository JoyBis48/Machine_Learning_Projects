"We see that they are not stopping," he says, suggesting the fight was now heading south to the port of Mariupol. "It doesn't take a genius to see what they are trying to do. They are taking more and more strategic points." The former ambassador was in the room during the attempts to broker a political solution with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Minsk. "Personally I don't trust him," he says. "You look at him and you think, 'Are you serious?'" "Nobody knows what is going on in his head. I believe he is becoming very emotional [over the two countries' historic ties]," he suggests, calling Putin's intentions "difficult to predict." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> According to what I've read, islamic law changes dramatically when a Caliphate is declared.

Islamic law isn't really affected by leaders, the legal precepts come from Muslim jurists. The basics of Islamic law fall into a spectrum of acceptable opinions (to mainstream Sunni Muslims) and deviations. A caliphate may pick and choose from different parts of the legal tradition, but they don't actually themselves have an effect on the law (in theory). </TEXT>

There's a regular generalization of this sub as a cess-pool of antisemitism due to suspicious posters (Indara-Varuna, etc.), deliberate and self-professed conspiritard trolls (Bip0lar bear, etc.) and the mouth-breathing basement dwellers working tirelessly to discredit the sub as a whole (duck_vimes, etc.). Your post, whether intentional or not, sets up a scarecrow argument, completely ignores the substance of the post made by the person you responded to and alludes to that absurd assertion of some sort of dominant anti-semetic trend across the sub.

So that's what raw, unadulterated retardation sounds like huh? Idiot. The OP asserted that there may be an Israel bias in administration at the site. The post you're replying to asserted that Reddit is presently owned by a Jewish billionaire. A majority of self-proclaimed Jews would identify with some sort of affinity or understanding towards Israel.

His post is an on point observation providing elucidating facts, yours is a desperate attempt to paint the presentation of facts as anti-semitism. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The reason the Japanese and Jordanian death created such an emotional reaction was because they made us first think there was hope for their survival. That there was an exchange. Its like a plot twist to make us angry. 

TBF, there actually is always hope for survival. They're like any other criminal gang, when the price is paid, they've let go of hostages in numerous cases (more times than they've killed hostages). In the case of Jordan, you might not be aware that during negotiations, Jordan allegedly ran a (failed) operation to save the hostage. I have a feeling that played a substantial role in what took place. As a specific example, you might note that the American woman they were holding hostage (who died in a Jordanian operation post execution of the pilot) explicitly mentioned her peers being freed (they delivered that letter we all saw).

Currently they're holding a fuck-ton of Peshmerga as hostages and they're in talks about a trade with the Kurds. I'm willing to bet that those Peshmerga hostages will get traded for the ISIS hostages being held by the Kurds as the Kurds don't have that same mentality of 'we don't negotiate with Terrorists' and though our (US) advisers will probably discourage it, they'll make the deal to save their loved ones. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They are obviously still upset about the previous crusades though.

I don't think so, there's plenty of modern issues to be upset about. The use of 'crusade' is entirely symbolic, the same way Bush referred to it as a 'Crusade' on one occasion as have other Christians in the military. It's not a reference to the original Crusade which no Christian I've known is particularly proud of - just a symbolic phrase.

They are always talking about killing the Pope and conquering rome.

Killing the pope? That's a mistranslation at best - what video did they say that in? When these guys reference "ar-Rum", it's not a reference to Rome proper in Italy or to the Vatican - it's historically been a general reference to "The West". Today - it's a reference to US hegemony / NATO / Allied powers. It's like when in medieval times, Europeans referred to Muslims as "Saracens" - it didn't mean the Saracens proper but Muslims in general.

My two cents - If we want to know what these people's grievances are objectively (something we need to do if there's ever going to be a lasting peace), I don't think its smart to write things off as an 'age-old' desire for revenge. In their statements, they don't say they're avenging the barbarity of the old Crusades - like ever. They particularly speak about activity that took place over the last 50 years and certain conditions that persisted into the modern age. </TEXT>

 They could probably actually have some sort of Islamic State if they weren't so psychotic.

Yea - probably. Doesn't seem like the end game of the leadership though.

I love how obsessed ISIS is with the crusades. I wonder if they realize that most of the western world doesn't even care about the pope. They can't get over some event that happened like 800 years ago.

When they talk about Crusade, they're referring to modern wars - not the actually Crusades or Papal authority.

	<TEXT> He is alleged to have specifically and seriously libeled one of two of the major academic institutions of Saudi Arabia - there's a reason CNN will mention the flogging but you won't find anyone actually discussing the blog posts. The change he (and some other young Saudis like him) was petitioning for is increased secularization, but more importantly, an overhaul of the academic and judicial system in Saudi.

By making this a big international issue (which is what he and his family have been doing - since seeking asylum - through the medical claim, etc.) - the regime will have to step in and over-rule the judiciary. The hope is (in addition to his case being overturned) that there will be a precedent set for greater 'freedom of expression', that will include being allowed to make the sort of claims he did about Saudi establishments.

An unintended consequence though is that an action by the ruler in favor of Badawi could stoke tensions within the kingdom. In Islamic law, there has always been a seperation between the judicial system and the executive role. So when Muslim leaders had a dispute with the populace, they had to be judged by an independent third party. When a judge has a dispute with a citizen, they go to another judge. And religion, in theory, places enough fear in the judges from taking sides because so-and-so is a peer or a friend.

You can see exactly what 'lashes' are in Saudi Arabia as somebody snuck a camera during his Jan 9th lashing. Unless he has some sort of critical condition, at 32 years of age, he can definitely take the caning and did just fine during his first lashing. Regardless of what we might think about the Saudi judicial system [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcYK3xqcAEY) isn't exactly some kind of tortuous punishment. It's arguably a lot less painful than some of the things that happen in our own penitentiaries.

And the administrators of corporal punishment in Saudi Arabia also have rules to abide by so it doesn't actually get more 'brutal' than this. You can't go more than 90 degrees with your arm, you can't hit the same spot twice in a row, you're not allowed to break the skin, etc. The shame associated with the punishment has a more powerful effect (except for this guy) then the physical aspect.

That said, I'm not saying I agree with happened - just clarifying that the images most people have of these punishments outside of Muslim circles is more based on surreal superstitions and hypotheses absent actual context. Hopefully that was helpful. </TEXT>

Lashes are different depending on where you go. In Saudi Arabia, they aren't (technically) allowed to pull their arm all the way back and then lash. They aren't allowed to go more than 90 degress. So he wouldn't die, or even scar - its more about slight pain and plenty of humiliation. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> and the torture

Interestingly, besides the senate report on torturey stuff that we've done - the Extremists aren't actually known for torture. There's no veritable evidence, or propaganda video by them where they actually torture someone. Our allies have plenty of videos like that (the Iraqi army), but the other crazy guys don't. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Muslims believe it's real. Muslims also believe in angels, so this thing isn't really a stretch.

If we suppose that Muhammad fabricated the entire incident though, it's a bit interesting that he would choose an insignificant sounding animal the size of a 'mule' and not something a little cooler like a dragon. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> IT IS HARAM TO REBEL AGAINST **MUSLIM** RULER. Those are words of Prophet Muhammad!

100% agree with the statement, you respect the ruler even if he's a Khariji Muslim who took power by force. But as for Assad - He's a Rafidi, and an Alawi Rafidi to boot...

I dare you. Go and make revolution in USA or Morocco and see how government will react. YOU WILL BE KILLED too if you will fight the government with froce.

So you're telling me if a group of people took up positions, with weapons and threatened government officials in the USA or Morocco, those leaderships would annihilate that entire group of people (women and children and all) - for the sake of shutting down one rally? And then allow the country to be torn apart by civil war? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If a significant portion of an ethnic population in your country ascribed itself to a particular religion, in exclusion to the religion of your own majority ethnic group, and you attacked the icons of their religion (and thereby them) - it's not a leap to draw racism, and at the least, xenophobia...

By your logic, most Stormfront material wouldn't even be racist since apparently in order to implicate racism we need something explicit only. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Terrorist attacks are not logical, sorry.

Sorry, you're an idiot. He's saying it's logical for the perps to be Muslim in Muslim countries given that Muslims are the majority in Muslim countries. It's statistics - but you might want to start with a more basic use of numbers before we journey into the world of probabilities and what-not. </TEXT>
