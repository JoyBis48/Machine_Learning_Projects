	<TEXT> I know its not, but when most people say "early internet", they are referring to "early www".  In a context outside of text-only communications, I assume that you know this.  Many of us know this.

There is never a need to be a dick about it.  Many people think the "internet" and the "web" are the same thing.  In terms of common language, these days it pretty much is.  Get over it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 1. Determine where you get the best antenna reception.
1. Analyze how you can achieve the cabling from your TV to that antenna placement.
1. Act upon your knowledge.  Determine a wiring route.  Measure twice, and buy (at least) a few feet more than (you think) you need.

For my current residence, I ran it under the living room rug, around the perimeter of the room.  Its a longer run, but it doesnt get stepped on or felt/seen in any way when walking through the area.

I also took the opportunity to run other advantageous wiring across the room under the rug.

At a previous residence I used a staple gun to tack the wiring around the wall baseboard, at the crease with the floor.  If you need ideas, Home Depot has tools and accessories for projects like this. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Can anyone recommend a game/server where characters have moral fortitude, stand up for what they believe in, and act as a unified team with their compatriots?

I've been a previous fan of Left4Dead for these reasons, but I'm looking for a larger group-play option.  And I'd really like to play on servers were the admin/mods listen to the players, and move forward with decisions that everyone wants - and not just what seems advantageous for attracting more future players.

Any recommendations would be appreciated, thanks!!! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The issue actually is not about her getting fired.  The consequences of her being fired were the straw that broke the camels back for many mods that depended on her.

The underlying problem is admin/mod communications.  Many subs are not directly effected by this problem and operate autonomously.  But that doesn't mean that there isnt just cause to show solidarity.

	<TEXT> This subreddit has (as far as I can tell) an active scanner that is collecting stats for subreddits that have gone private since "AMAgeddon" began.

	<TEXT> I've seen the responses.  I have been reading through related threads both present and past four 4+ hours now.  I didnt know who Ellen Pao was before today.  I previously could have cared less.  After today's events and what I have read: *I care.*

talking in comments isnt protesting - its discussing.  thats what we typically do on reddit: we discuss things.  protesting is taking action against something, and in this case the protest is using silence.  we cant protest in our discussions because, a) its useless, because b) we cannot interact in any meaningful way with the admins.

you obviously dont care about the issue at hand, and that's fine.  you don't have to be vested in this, or care what direction the site is going in.  and I dont mean that in a sarcastic or demeaning manner.  reddit, like many sites, is a tool.  Use or care for the tool how you want.

If you dont care, then dont complain about it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They seem to be quite on-board with all the privateering.  /r/Portugal is also.  My favorite translated quote from there is:

 hoje  dia de cozido caralho! onde  que vou comer agora?

Which translates roughly to, *"today is cooked ass! where am I going to eat now?"*

No one is screaming.  This is a silent protest against months of admin/mod improprieties.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You could try better rice.  Minute rice is craptastic imho - but, I might be a bit of a rice snob.  Different rices add different flavor nuances as well as textures.

My go-to rice is Nishiki.  Do yourself a huge favor and buy a proper rice cooker. </TEXT>
