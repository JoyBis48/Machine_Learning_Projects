	<TEXT> Another klassic ninja skin? Awesome. Won't be long before we have the full set... hopefully. I know a lot of people really want a klassic Ermac skin, I hope they get it.

That infrared skin, is it just for Scorpion or is it for eveyone? I think Scorpion's got enough costumes already. </TEXT>

Also, each Half Life game that was released pushed the boundaries of what FPS games were capable of, and pretty much set the standard for the genre when they were released. The games might not be what the masses consider to be fun or exciting (although they are), they're technically groundbreaking games. This is why people want Valve to make another one. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The whole false bravado thing they have going on.

"Look at me! Look at how rich I am! Look how much weed I smoke! Look how I wield my AK! Look at my car! Look at those shiny wheels! Look at all these hot women I paid to be in my video! Look at my comically over sized clothes! Look at all this jewelry I wear! Look at how much of a big hard gangster I am!"

Then watch them go home and be told by their wife they're not allowed chicken, so they have to send their assistant out to get it on the sly.

I find the whole thing to be a cringe worthy joke, the fact they take it so seriously only adds to the hilarity. I have no interest in listening to something that musically is extremely basic (often to the point of just re-using music someone else made that was already popular), and lyrically is both vapid and a lie.

There are some good hip hop songs, don't get me wrong. I don't think it's all shit, just the stuff I've mentioned here. Which seems to be 85% of it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's fine. I don't feel like I'm in danger when using reddit. It's just a typical kneejerk reaction to people's freedoms supposedly being oppressed.

It seems a lot of people seem to think that reddit is somehow affected by the US government's constituion regarding free speech. Reddit owns reddit, they can silence whatever they want. I almost cannot believe how much of a big issue is being made over this, and the childish reaction from many redditors just makes me happy that a lot of them claim to be ready to leave reddit. We'll be better off without them.

Also people like to use the slippery slope argument. Whatever. What's the worst thing reddit could to us? Shut down the site I guess, that would be the ultimate form of "suppression of free speech", even though they're stopping people from saying what they want elsewhere.

I guess it depends on what you mean by safe. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  30 used to be the norm

When? I remember Street Fighter II Turbo and Sonic Spinball being 55 back in 1993. That equates to roughly 101 in today's money. Sure most games weren't 55 back then, but some were. I remember the average price of a Mega Drive game being around 40, going up 10 - 15 in 20 years isn't so bad really. Games may technically be more expensive now but considering how little the price has risen since the 16 bit era compared to how much content games now have they've never been better value for money than they are right now. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If they found us I reckon they'd observe us for a while, no idea what they'd do after that. They might just leave once they see how primitive we are compared to them. If this is the first planet they've seen with life on it (besides their own) they'd probably either want to interact with us, or they might do the whole "Don't interfere with nature" thing.

My thing is if they've got the tech to get here they'd surely have the tech to remain hidden from us, and they certainly wouldn't come all the way here to just crash like some people think, they'd be pretty inept aliens if they did that.

Sure there's some unexplained sightings, but they're just that, unexplained. Most sightings have been explained as being something like a plane, weather balloon (cliche I know) or just strange lighting. I think the time to believe aliens have visited us is when there's good evidence to support it, not anecdotal heresay and footage which can be easily manipulated digitally. </TEXT>

Yes they do. People see things in the sky that they can't identify, some people think it's alien ships, I think they're mistaken.

There's so many things these people could have seen, at the end of the day they saw a UFO, the U meaning unidentified, meaning they don't know what it is, jumping to conclusions that it's aliens is silly.

I don't believe anyone has seen aliens visit Earth. I believe aliens exist, but not that they've been here. Based on the fact that we KNOW people lie, and we KNOW people are prone to being mistaken, and we KNOW our senses are easily fooled, and we haven't seen any verifiable evidence of aliens being here, I don't believe people who claim to have seen alien space ships have actually seen alien space ships. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [Serious] Why are the Transformers movies pretty much universally hated? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-06-09 09:06:59 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I like the Transformer films, you know why? Because I like the Transformers, and I sometimes like to watch mindless action. People shit all over Bay's films because he likes to blow shit up, sometimes I want to see shit get blown up. There's always room for Whiplash, Birdman, The Theory of Everything. But there's also room for Transformers. Obviously the human elements of those films always suck balls and should be dropped from all future Transformer films, but I for one love watching giant robots beat the shit out of each other, and frankly I'm amazed that seemingly no-one else does.

How odd.

Transformers 2 is the obvious exception, that film can go die somewhere. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was told I had to preorder GTAV to get access to the blimp. I preordered it 8 months before release to make sure I'd get a copy (this was back when I thought games could still sell out). I was standing in line with my Xbox 360 preorder but changed my mind to PS3 when my friend finally told me he was going to get it. So I picked up a PS3 copy, minus a pre-order, and I still go the blimp.

This was when I realised pre-ordering games was literally a waste of time. </TEXT>
