	<TEXT> [Maho's Japanese VA has pretty good english too](https://youtu.be/dhl_j6gcww8?t=5m32s). Ryusuke's VA has a thick accent but understandable enough.

It also kind of bothered me that Koyuki never bothered learning english until the end of the manga.

	<TEXT> I got confused and thought the colonists already got annihilated but right now that's what they're trying to prevent. I believe those colonists were the group of pacifist that wanted to leave Sidonia. Wouldn't be surprised if the Captain is using them as a lure.

It was also densely packed with ideas relating to technology, philosophy, psychology, sociology, and politics. Even though it can feel academic at times, it was for the most part thought provoking. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The playerbase around 3 million or so. I really doubt most of the players who watched the anime liked it. Personally, I know of several people who disliked it along with others that I've talked to on the internet.

Conjecture and anecdotal evidence are far worse than small sample size data. My point of contention is people better have data to back it up if they're going to claim something is hated by the majority. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I went back to the space scene. The camera was moving at 24 fps but there were times the characters would start jittering which made it look like a framerate problem. Also in these first few episodes I've noticed some panning and tilting shots where the camera moved at 12 fps, which I don't think happened in the first season. I think Polygon might have been stretched thin since Ronja was two cours and demanded more manpower for higher quality art and animation. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Every season I sometimes pickup an anime with a wacky concept (e.g. Kancolle, Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei) just for the novelty of it and with very little expectations. This was my pick for this season and it was definitely better than expected. But now I have some expectations for it and the prospect of adapting a bunch of chapters into 12 episodes doesn't sound too encouraging. I think as long as the show remains funny I'll be satisfied, then give the manga a read sometime later. </TEXT>

Kind of disappointed that the phonetic lip syncing and expressive facial animation that Polygon did in Sanzoku no Musume Ronja didn't carry over to season 2 of Sidonia. This pretty much suggests the budget difference between the two. Action scenes still looked great with great sense of speed. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The problem is the 60 fps is just frame interpolation not actual animation. CG actually hand animated at 60 fps would look great but the man-power and budget required would be ridiculous even for Disney/Pixar and Dreamworks. CG at 60 fps with the use of Mo-cap is probably doable though. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hmm...plans for the 2nd season was announced on November 2014, that's news to me. First season sold really bad (374 discs first week sales). The backers must have known this would be the case from the start, so the anime series was mainly for the promotion of the Garo franchise.

I'm in for the 2nd season. The 1st season had an uneven quality but nothing egregiously dislikeable. It also had some great moments and overall the show was entertaining. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This was my second read through so it didn't affect me as much but I remember being close to tearing up at the "I love you" part. The nice slow build up to that part was what made it so emotive.

The rooftop scene was practically Kaori's love confession so this letter was more of a reinforcement of her feelings and less of a confession beyond the grave. Although some may feel it's still the latter and be peeved by it.

I thought it was a great manga. Kousei's character development had an ebb and flow to it instead of a linear progression. It made his development feel natural since people don't improve and change at a constant pace. The story was also very effective at demonstrating the notion of bonding, healing and expressing oneself through music. I think this was less of a love story and more of a human drama between two people supporting each other through music as they navigate lifes tribulations. </TEXT>

Actually one of the best character and facial animation I've seen in anime is from Sanzoku no Musume Ronja, another CG show done by Polygon.

Really liked how Yona's development through a climactic external conflict was followed by her having to face her internal conflict, which is her feelings for Soo-Won. Pretty damn excited about the reactions from Yona, Soo-Won and Hak in the final two episodes.

Also, Hak is barely making any progress with Yona as it is and now Soo-Won shows up.  </TEXT>

I really appreciate that it didn't go big for the tear jerker, like having Kousei by Kaori's deathbed or something equally superfluously morose. The manga stayed true to her story which is not about that she's terminally ill but the way she lived and her connection with Kousei. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The hand washing scene was excellently storyboarded. The graphic match cuts of Kousei and Kaori's hands working in rhythm with the alternating silence and sound of running water was serenely melancholic.

Also really liked the reserved use of canted framing. It was saved for the right moments. A lot of anime tend to overuse canted shots when things get tense or dramatic and the effect gets lost. The hand washing scene saved it for the last shot and it worked well as a visual supplement to Kousei's emotions.  </TEXT>
