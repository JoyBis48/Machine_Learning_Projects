	<TEXT> Here's the best way to determine if you're an AB.

Do you identify as an AB?

Survey says:

I consider me not being an AB just a DL.

I think if anything you're a DL who's interested in the AB side of things. But that's just my two cents.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi. My name is /u/test_subject1730 and I'm an alcoholic. I've been in Alcoholic Anonymous  for damn near 3 years now. The program is helpful but still full of shit at the same time. I've never been in a bigger real life circlejerk before, but it has helped me stay sober. Everyday I struggle with not drinking and I know that there are people I can call if it gets bad that have been there and can talk me down from the ledge, as it were. People talk about addiction to numerous drugs, but a lot of people forget the powerful effects that alcohol has and that it too is just as powerful of a demon as many illicit substances.  </TEXT>
