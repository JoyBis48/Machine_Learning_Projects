	<TEXT> Yes, but I've only taken methylphenidate orally. I would say EPH is more euphoric then MPH but it doesn't last as long. EPH is also caustic and burns when you snort it, which is a good enough reason for me to moderate my use and keep my sinuses from getting too damaged. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'd say ethylphenidate is the closest you're going to get to coke in the RC market. It's an NDRI that gives a decent rush when snorted. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah I think it popped up in November on the RC market. In my experience 20mg snorted provides brief euphoria that gives way to 2-3 hours of functional stimulation. Less euphoria than EPH but I noticed less vasoconstriction as well. Similar burn to EPH when you snort it. May be caustic. Also, people have reported being pleased with how it vapes off foil and gives a pleasant rush. Personally I wouldn't vape more than 5-10mg though.  
  
For reference I have a moderate to low stimulant tolerance. Remember that RCs can affect everyone differently, so start small with dosing if you get your hands on some. Check out the 3F-phenmetrazine thread on Bluelight for more info :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Jesus OP please don't follow this advice. Please don't give out dosage advice for substances that you aren't familiar with, especially a substance as unpredictable as heroin. Nobody should be doing more than 5-10mg at a time snorted without a tolerance, and that should only be after snorting ~1mg to test potency. Heroin has the potential to be cut with the opioid fentanyl, which is active in microgram doses and can significantly increase the risk of CNS depression. Even when taking dosing precautions such as these, you're still playing with fire and I don't recommend it. Stay safe, you can always take more but you can never take less. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would say low dose ethylphenidate complements alcohol well, as well as 3-fluorophenmetrazine. I feel that their short durations allow you to fall asleep more easily at the end of the night than you would if you were on amphetamines.  
  
I tend to start with a small dose (~20mg) early in the night and redose one or two times throughout depending on how much I drink.  
edit: added dosage in case people are curious </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi /r/opiates, I've been lurking for a while and now I have a question.   
  
I have a few 24mg suboxones that I've been chopping into 16ths and snorting. This gets me pretty relaxed. I find subs pretty recreational during my breaks from H but I use infrequently. I'm looking to try clonazepam at the same time but I'm not sure what dosage I should start with. I'm aware that mixing benzos and opiates can be fatal. Cheers! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You could cut up some lines and scrape them into little baggies, then when you want to snort it take a small straw and snort it straight from inside the baggie. Very fast and discrete way to do a line. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree with your once a month sentiment, it's been working pretty well for me so far. I've found that the best part about using opiates once a month is how your tolerance essentially resets after waiting so long. </TEXT>
