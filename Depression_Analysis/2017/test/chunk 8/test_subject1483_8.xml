	<TEXT> I'm probably going to get massacred with the downvote blade of death but I've grown not to like Halo 3. The only reason being, no sprinting. I had forgotten that Halo 3 didn't have sprint, ended up dying so many times because instead of running into cover he was casually strolling in. I really don't know how I used to play. </TEXT>
