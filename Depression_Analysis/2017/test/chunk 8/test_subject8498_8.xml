	<TEXT> You fucking piece of shit. You are part of the problem that the Internet is objectified in this world. Have some sympathy for a REAL Redditor with a HORRIBLE autistic problem and stop being such a jackdaw. This is someone's SJW or stalker. This comment will probably not do anything to change you from being so rude but I want you to think if this is really the type of user you want to be.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> well i'd imagine most hard drugs must have some kind of appeal if some people are willing to destroy themselves and everything they hold dear for one more hit.  

I had problems with addiction in my past.
 Generally at this point you descrine doing the drug of choices isn't fun anymore, you chase those first highs when you felt amazing and awesome, but it's never ever the same. You kind of get satisfied for a bit and then crave more, and more, until you have no drug left and then you feel like fucking shit. Then you go and buy more, and the cycle repeats.  

You can't stop doing the drug but not because it feels super awesome, but rather because not using feels like fucking hell to an addict.

	<TEXT> I'm trying to think outside the box here, I know this question is probably really stupid, but how do we know is mass causing gravity instead of lack of "no-mass"? I mean, suppose that empty space pushes you evenly in every direction, so, you stay stationary. But put an object with mass close enough to you to interfere with that pushing force, and you start going towards that object, because now your receive the pushing force from one side more than other.  

Does that make any kind of sense?

	<TEXT> Well, towards the end of the 90s (1998) it was discovered that the expansion of the universe is (very contrary to the belief in that time) occurring at an accelerating rate. Before that it was thought that galaxies moved away from each other more slowly as time passed, but since 1998 we know it's not, they move away faster and faster, and will continue to do so. One of the most accepted theories to explain this weird effect from the universe is the Dark Energy Theory, but it's 1:15am here and I'm about to sleep, so I'll leave that to another redditor or go into it a bit more tomorrow. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> These two, both from /r/AskReddit:

-[What is the scariest theory known to man?](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/31nbca/whats_the_scariest_theory_known_to_man/)   

-[[Serious] [NSFW] Redditors who have been on the brink of death/legally dead, can you describe what it felt like?](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2qmt72/serious_nsfw_redditors_who_have_been_on_the_brink/) 

Both had very deep and mindblowing questions. I particularly like the one from the redditors who have died, because most of them talk about the acceptance of death in those final moments, and brings my mind at peace knowing that maybe in those few last instants, I'll be ok with what's happening. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You're saying that a teacher advicing students to study, because otherwise they won't meet the knowledge to approve the class is a threat. I believe you need to learn the concept of threat, because with that logic every advice in "don't do X because Y (bad thing) is going to happen to you" form is a threat to you.   
  
As other people said, if he's doing this out of pure justice seeking, he should also in all the other "sellers" that aren't registered as well. Besides, being in the legal right doesn't mean it isn't a dick move, OP may face jailtime because a very stupid thing.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> PSA: You can config your "mousewheel down" to switch to previous weapon (pistols, grenades, etc) while on a car, so it doesn't change radio stations anymore and avoid missing the desired weapon. </TITLE>

	<TEXT> I've seen a lot of comments complaining about this, the option is there in control settings. In Spanish it has a misleading name (something that in English would translate to "previous car weapon", in Spanish it sounds like it's taking about in-car-built weapons) and assuming the amount of comments I'm seeing here about this matter I'm assuming it also does on English.  

It's among the top 5, just set it to mouse wheel down and you can go back and forth with pistols, grenades, etc on your car with your wheel. Pretty useful, I don't know why this isn't default.  

Cheers! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm pretty sure you are doing this in order to get money from Tobias, but I can see why you are and will continue to deny this. 

You will say that money isn't your primary interest in this course of action, but you know it is. Look, I'm not looking for you to admit it, I'm just saying that you and everyone else here know what's this about. So, I'm going to tell you that besides this being the biggest jerk move I've heard in quite some time, and apart from me criticizing the lack of ethics in your actions (which clearly is a topic you don't care about), I'm going to speak your language: this is a terrible, terrible decision economically-wise for your business.     

Reddit is a huge platform, and you should consider that gaining bad reputation here can really hurt your business. And I mean **really**. The word will come out and a lot of people in the MTG niche will stop buying from you, and as I know you don't care about justice or whatever justification you want to tag on this dick move, but only about gaining more money, I am telling you this is one of the worst ways to accomplish that. You may gain some cash from OP, but that's nothing compared to what you will lose against a angry community that will boicott your operation by not buying anymore.  

So, in the slim chance you'll reply to this, I know you are going to say money isn't your goal here etc etc. But yeah, you, me, and everyone else here knows that's just gibberish. Consider what I'm saying to you, it's in your business best interest. </TEXT>
