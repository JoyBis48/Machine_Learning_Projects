	<TEXT> I talk to my mom about it a lot and she says I will either have to speak up to them or live with it. She will help me through anything, I know that. I'm just afraid. My school doesn't have a counselor, I dont want to talk to one anyway. Thank you for the kind words. I don't think my dad will do anything physically, he hasn't in a while. The only thing he has done to me was spank, but I think he knows I'm too old for that now. He has threatened once in the past few months, I fear he will go through with it, but deep down I just know he won't. My stepmother threatened to slap me in the face, but I don't even fear her. I just despise her. 

I'm trying to take care, but it's just so hard being the only adult around because my father and stepmom won't. I'm practically raising my little brothers. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have tried talking to them... My older brother has as well. When that happened, my dad slammed him into a cabinet. He later moved out to my mom's house. When I tried to talk to them, they just started yelling at me that I have a bad attitude and I got grounded for 3 weeks. 

My brothers wonderful advice was to put up with it and act like I was happy and always have a smile on my face. Then when I turn 13, move out to my mom's house. My brother waited until my dad pushed him (age 17) because he didn't want me to be alone there. But here I am, about to turn 13, and I'm so so scared of telling them I want to leave. My mom knows, she said my dad would take it to court, and we would have to fight. She said we would win, because dad already has lost a son. If CPS has been called before this on him then surely we will win, right? and it's not about the chores; I'm fine with doing chores. It's that the ONLY time they EVER talk to me is to yell at me about them. 

Our family will never come together. You would thing that my bro leaving is a wake up call to them, but it's not. They still think they are the perfect parents with the perfect family, and they will always think that. Some people dont change.

	<TEXT> My dad only ever talks to me if it's to do chores/schoolwork. I can't remember the last time he *actually* talked to me. He always yells, and complains that he's so sore from crossfit. 

My stepmother acts like she owns me, like I'm an *object*. I don't have real conversations with here either. When I'm at this house, I never talk. Just do chores, mow the lawn, get grounded because I have a bad attitude, and do schoolwork that isn't due for 3 WEEKS. They always yell at me, make me call them Sir and Ma'am.

And I hate them for it. </TEXT>

1) Have a microphone, communication is the key to success!

2) Be a level 26 or higher. You can accomplish this by having a full set of rare gear.

3) Have a positive attitude! No one likes that one guy that complains the whole raid.
