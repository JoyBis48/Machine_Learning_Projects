	<TITLE> 26/F/BOS (USA) - Anywhere that will teach me how to be self sufficient and live off of natural resources </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-01-17 20:43:33 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hey there. I just discovered this sub and I'm not really sure how exactly I can change my life but I'm looking for any and all advice/help in getting things together.  

First a little history:  

 I grew up never really knowing what home was. I was abused, put into the foster care system and bounced around from 14-18. Never really knew anything about my father until I was 16 and reached out to him.  

My mom is a third generation American (Irish) and my father is an Israeli (his mother was born in Yemen, from what I understand). I grew up poor and without anyone teaching me how to be self sufficient. I had to learn all of that the hard way. From what I understand, my father was wealthy until he was arrested in 1988 for drug trafficking (he was the head of a local cocaine ring) and left us with nothing (the government seized everything and my mom tried to bribe him so he severed completely with the hopes that we would contact him later in life).  

Basically, for me, I just want to run away. I'm sick of the life I have and I've often dreamed of just getting out and living somewhere I can just garden, hunt, fish and live in the wilderness away from most people. I'm sick of having my income go mostly to keeping a roof over my head and bills, yet still not being able to afford to pay off my debt because I practically break even every month.  

The catch is that I don't have the skills to really live off the land and want so badly to be taken on as someone's apprentice (so to speak). I want to learn it all. I want to get out of the city and work my way up to being completely self sufficient. I'm at the point where I want to just drop everything and walk away from my life. I virtually want to commit suicide of my former self and just find the happy, free person that is dying to get out.  

Maybe this won't reach anyone that can help me, but even the slightest suggestions would matter so much to me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I guess I didn't read "destabilize" as "cause war" and more so just felt that this pope is pretty rad and has made a lot of statements encouraging compassion to a lot of groups that had received a lot of hate (gays, evolutionary biology, etc) that if he was **assassinated** it would cause a lot of outrage....

	<TEXT> It's okay, spunky monkey has a stick up his/her ass. While it's possible for the dog to have been flicked with water; it's doubtful the dog would stay in place while that happens to him (even if OP is holding a treat, a dog would think the flicking motion was OP throwing it and likely stand up). Also, we can't see the other side of the vest so we don't know if it's not drool or rainwater (it was sprinkling where I live today) or anything. Some people just really love to claim animal abuse with little to no evidence...  
I'm not absolving OP because my claims are as good as any other schmuck, but let's give OP benefit of the doubt.   SpunkyMonkey has already commented on this thread the same accusation quite a few times.
