	<TEXT> It's beautiful seeing us play well and beating Boston. Most of my friends are Red Sox fan and they all said we would be dead last in the AL East and that this is the worst Yankees team in a long time. It's lovely to see us in first place, even if it's only the second of May. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You just gotta work at it. It sounds like you need to work with adding, subtracting and dealing with negatives. That's the base you need to build to regain your math. Trust me, it's possible you just need to be determined to do it. I used to hate math, but I realized that I need it for what I want to do after college and this really helped. In my free time I would work on building my basic math and I've tried to stop using a calculator all together and it's pretty spectacular how far I've come. I started in remedial math level courses in college and now I can do some multi step problems in my head.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Best MLB2k franchise mode? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-04-18 23:40:58 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I have xbox 360 so sadly I can't play the show. I'm wondering which MLB2k game offers the best franchise mode. I'm just wondering overall, because I have MLB2k10. I'm at the all star break and there are 7 pitchers with a sub 4 era. In the 2010-11 real MLB season there were 11 guys with a sub 3 era and roughly 25 with a sub 4 era. My main concern is stat simulation realism I guess. 

THANK YOU </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The first game of the season I went to was our win against Boston and you could tell the fans knew he was gonna knock in some runs in his first at bat. If he hits over 275 and knocks in 20+ hrs I would say he's had a successful season and I'm sure most Yankee fans that want the team to win and do well this season are supporting him. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I currently have MLB2k10 and playing franchise upsets me because I'll notice the league leaders in ERA will have an era over 3.50 and only a few guys will be under 4.00. 
I'm really just trying to figure out if there's a mlb2k game out there that doesn't have these issues </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well someone could make the argument that we've never had a good president. I wouldn't agree with that, but the point I'm trying to make is that it certainly isn't unanimous that W was the worst president ever. I'm sure if we had a nationwide vote W would win, but that's only due to the recency of his presidency and the likes of Jon Stewart.  </TEXT>
