	<TEXT> Standard tapered have significant'y more thigh room than slims. I went with a standard tapered because I normally can't wear slim pants (511 is a sausage-thigh fit) and I normally wear normal tapers but I definitely could have gone with a slim tapered. Think of slim as the standard, skinny as the slim, and standard as the "plus".

I will say the standard still has a nice taper to them. They won't look like dad pants.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You should wear light, pastel colors. 

If you want to really go in depth, check out [this](http://www.wikihow.com/Choose-Colors-That-Flatter-Skin-Tone) guide to determining your skin tone. Once you've found it, search your skin tone + color chart to find a palate of colors that work well with your specific skin tone. 

Note that these aren't set rules! If you find a color that doesn't match your skin tone but you think still looks good on you, rock it! And what color your clothes are relative to you matters very little. What's much more important is your clothes' color relative to each other. 

As for what clothes you should wear, check out the side bar's Getting Started Guide and hang around on this sub. 

Good luck! </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Help me find a light gray winter coat? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> I know charcoal colored gets thrown around here a lot but I already have one of those (J. Crew University coat, which I love) and I'm looking to expand my coat selection during the coming end-of-season sales. I am looking for a light, heather gray wool coat.

I love the design and color of [this Zara](http://www.zara.com/us/en/sale/man/coats-and-trench-coats/coats/double-faced-coat-c541817p2161054.html) coat but I have heard bad things about Zara and the quality at this price point. I would rather have something that will last me a while. Is there anything with a similar design? Or should I just go for this one?

I also like the [Schott Car Coat in Heather Gray](https://www.schottnyc.com/products/wool-car-coat.htm) but my size is already sold out. 

The [J. Crew Skiff Jacket](https://www.jcrew.com/AST/Navigation/Sale/AllProducts/PRD~A9716/A9716.jsp?Nbrd=J Nloc=en_US Nrpp=48 Npge=1 Ntrm=skiff isSaleItem=true color_name=CHARCOAL isFromSearch=true isNewSearch=true hash=row0) is also nice but doesn't come in the light gray color I want.

Do you know of any coats that fit my description?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> All this is sound advice, but if he is unmotivated to do any of this with you, there is very little you can do to persuade him otherwise. Some people just don't care about clothing or fashion at all, and no amount of guidance or conversation will be able to change that. If you try all of this and he STILL doesn't want to do it, please don't try to force it or make ultimatums or anything like that, for the sake of your relationship. Just accept that he really doesn't care and drop the issue. 

I really hope everything works out! Good luck! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I used to do the same thing as you when I was first starting out and buying my basic items. Now that I have a good enough wardrobe my shopping experience is a little different. There are a few items that I am looking at purchasing/upgrading to add to my wardrobe (parka, dress shoes) that I am slowly researching and taking my time on purchasing. When I go to stores I take a look at these items but also "impulse buy" anything that I like that is on sale (ie. might not be there when I come back) at stores that have good return policies. I then sit on it for a while and really consider whether I will really use an item or not. Most often I end up returning the item. If what I like is not on sale I'll add it to my list of things to research more. This gives me the "shopping fix" without wasting any money.

I view shopping as more of a journey than a destination spot. I have more than enough basics that I don't have to make trips to buy specific things anymore - instead, I shop to see new clothes that maybe aren't exactly in line with my current style or something I wouldn't necessarily think of wearing. Maybe I will be inspired to try something new. 

A total of zero of my friends care about dressing well, and they view shopping as a chore and only go when they absolutely need something, and try to be in and out as fast as possible. They make fun of me for going every week and coming back with nothing. But I don't care. To me it's an experience that helps me develop my personal style. 

Plus going by myself gets me away from my asshole friends. 

TL;DR: what you're doing is fine and better than what most people do.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Stretch might not be the right word to use... A wool coat will "soften" up over time, conform to your body shape and become much more comfortable to wear after a little while. 

I definitely think there is such a thing as "breaking in" a wool coat. If the fit is fine, just give it a little time to relax and form to you.  </TEXT>
