	<TEXT> I have a similar situation at my school, I can make recommendations but a parent can override me. I have a student who is intelligent enough to do the work but has no work ethic he will make a c in my class. He will fail ap English and make a cs and bs  in his other classes . we have all recommended he take cp next year but his dad insist he take honors class. It sucks because it really throws the who dynamic of the class off. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We have a winner take all system meaning that if one guy gets 49%of the vote and the other guy gets 51% then he gets the seat in congress for his district. So smaller parties never have a chance to win a portion of the seats like they do in other countries. Also the bigger parties often take the ideas of smaller parties so there is no need to vote for them. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I went to an eating disorder clinic many years ago not as a vegan but as a vegetarian. When I checked in I was allowed to list 3 things I wouldn't eat I chose chicken beef and pork (I figured they wouldn't serve much fish and I was right) after three days of complying with the menu they gave me I was allowed to  choose the foods I wanted as long as they met my dietary requirements so I actually never ate meat while I was there had yoghurt a couple times and eggs once when I didn't get to choose. I hope this helps put you at ease a bit . I have been in recovery for 6 years its a hard battle but I am much happier now than I was back then. If you want to talk inbox me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Opportunity cost is it worth it to loose the person you are with to experiment? It may be but it might also do a lot of damage. I feel like some times my bisexuality starts kicking in when I am unhappy in my current relationship and instead of dealing with it I start fantasizing about the sex I am not with.  I am very happy with who I am dating now and even though I have attraction to both sexes it isn't something I want to act on. Not saying this is what is going on with you but just thought I would share my experience. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Your options would probably to bus tables at a restaurant and work your way up. Unless you know someone it is unlikely they will pay you to learn to be an electrian . Charleston is a popular city and jobs can be difficult to come by especially down town. In the city a one bedroom will run you 700$ to 1200$. Their is a party scene here so if you are looking to grow up it also might not be the best place. Not trying to be negative but just trying to be honest. Best of luck what ever you decide. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes you should give up your seat to anyone who is in need... pregnant, elderly, disabled, here take my seat. For no other reason than it is the right thing to do. You can not like kids and still like people. And I am sure I will get down voted to hell for saying this but sometimes this sub is less about being child free and more about hating kids. I like kids I don't have them because I like my freedom more . pregnancy is difficult for most women and if I can ease someone's suffering a bit by standing on the metro then I will. </TEXT>
