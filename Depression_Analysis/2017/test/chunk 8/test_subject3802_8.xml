	<TEXT> But... It does. When you say "overlap" it just sounds like a duplication of features when it is simply not the case, if they have different implementations then they will break and neither gravity box's nor the ROMs implementation of that particular feature will work (see: quick settings on omnirom) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well... Yeah it does. It broke omniroms quick settings before the gravity box dev added an option to disable tweaks individually. And if you install it on cm and enable pie controls in both it breaks that. Its really only meant for stock.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The point is, the exploit they "burned" was one that many jailbreak developers used to find other, more difficult to discover vulnerabilities, since the exploit was apparently a very easy one that has worked on every iOS version since comex discovered it. Now that they've used it, it will be patched, causing any and all jailbreak efforts from here on in to take a significantly longer amount of time. You're probably right about them sitting on an exploit until iOS 8 or 8.1, but the problem is that now, they may not even find an exploit in 7.1 to sit on until 8, meaning the community will have to wait much longer. This also affects all future iterations of iOS, not just 7.1 and 8. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I had this problem for ages on my old Samsung device. I wiped my phone, flashed new firmware on my router, did everything I could but it consistently happened. A data wipe would fix it for a bit but it would simply happen again. The only way I was able to fix it was using an app called Mac Changer, which changes your device's MAC ID so your router thinks it's a different device. Every time the obtaining IP address thing happened I'd generate a new Mac address and it would work for another day or so. Only thing is, the app requires root.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> All of them. Omnirom are focusing on their original features (namely active display and their new incoming call screen) before they start porting over the more common ones. This means that features you have come to expect from custom roms (since they are in almost all of them) are not present, such as lockring targets and quicksettings customisation. In the mean time, I'm using Xposed with Gravitybox to bring those features to my device. Active Display alone is worth flashing for. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Because Android runs on all sorts of hardware, its difficult to write native code that will play nicely on all the devices its available to. So, to combat this, Android ships with a VM - the Dalvik VM. This means that developers can write their apps in Java which are then translated into native code on the fly for the device. This extra compatibility comes at a cost: performance. ART is Google's effort to help lower that cost and increase performance. Instead of compiling the apps at runtime, ART completely pre-compiles all the apps on your phone (theoretically) making them faster to launch.

^ this is a very basic understanding and something that could have been Googled. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's a framework that hooks into the Android system files that allow the changing of those files on the fly (versus flashing or overwriting the files for individual mods). This has many benefits such as ease of use, and increased mod compatibility - such as two different mods that make changes to systemui - instead of having to choose between the two mods (since installing one on top of the other will only make the last-installed one active) they can now be implemented side-by-side. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Nothing that happens to you before 30 matters, in the grand scheme of things; it just doesn't. The sooner teens and 20 somethings accept that, the better off they will be, and the less suicides and depression will occur.

While I agree with you somewhat, let me also tell you why I disagree with you invalidating the way people feel as well. Life is proportional... as you get older, things that may have previously seemed huge to you are not quite as big. This is simply because you have experienced more. Take this [crudely made pie chart](http://i.imgur.com/U59ok5I.png). Say you've been in a relationship for 3 years. For an 18 year old, it is *proportionally* larger than what it would be for a 30 year old. That relationship ending, if we were to scale it, would feel the same way it would for a 30 year old to lose a relationship of ~5 years. It's a bit poorly explained, but hopefully you do get where I'm going with that.

The point is, just because things are insignificant to you does not mean that the validity and strength of the feelings that a person experiences is not real. I say this because at 18 years old, I have been through a bit of shit. And maybe it's trivial. Looking back now, I can see that what was going on was stupid and dumb, but hindsight is always like that. If I could go back to my past self and try to explain it, I wouldn't listen. The vastness of my feelings wouldn't go away because I told myself that it was insignificant (I even did so at the time).

So; I do agree with you. But you should never, ever invalidate someone's feelings. Because that will cause more suicides than people "taking what they go through far, far too seriously". </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The Play Store version won't be 2.0. Reinstall the .apk you have. Google rolls out big updates like this slowly based on your device's IMEI and country, so not everyone gets 2.0 at the same time (even though the app's description says so).

Edit: to understand, go to hangouts in the play store, expand the description and look at the current version. Mine is still 1.2 ( http://www.imgur.com/6kLfCTf.png ) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You did something wrong then. Whenever you flash a ROM, it always comes with a kernel, because otherwise it wouldn't boot (well, it might, but ROMs always come with a kernel that the developers KNOW is compatible to ensure that it actually boots). Franco kernel doesn't even support 4.4 yet, so if you actually did have it on 4.4, you would either not be able to boot or see a shit tonne of graphical glitches. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> While I agree with many of the points you made, I think that a lot of people in this thread are jumping to conclusions. I think its a safe assumption to make that Google were rushed with the nexus 5 release, and have only had the resources to get KitKat optimized for the nexus 5. I'm not going to promise to eat my dick but I'd bet good money that the factory images that drop for the nexus 4 will start with 4.4.1.  </TEXT>
