	<TEXT> We both love cream of whatever soups, Gumbo, and things like Beouf Bourgignon, that require a coating of flour before searing the meat. Of course there are many soups that don't require flour, but I'd like to adapt our favorites to fit her needs. She was only recently diagnosed. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Gluten free roux/soup? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-12-21 16:28:21 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I am planning on making a bunch of soup for a friend with Celiac's. However, all of our favorites involve flour.

I know the obvious substitutions for thickening agents (cornstarch + water, instant mashed potatoes), but what about recipes where you need to cover chunks of meat with flour before searing (beouf bourgignon and the like)? Would rice or almond flour work for things like this?

She is completely broke (not like that "broke as a joke" post, she literally has $5 for the rest of the month), so I want to help her out as much as I can. I was planning on making several types of soup in the next few days anyway, but I never cook gluten free, since I don't have a problem with it.

What suggestions do you wonderful cooks have?

EDIT: thank you all for the suggestions! I will be making quite a few soups with your help this week. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Keep supporting her. Since you said you also SH, that makes it a little easier. Suggest that she go to see a professional, but don't push it too much (I just went through something where my friends pushed too hard). Let her know that it hurts you when she hurts herself, and, if she doesn't already know, let her know that you suffer from the same thing.

Furthermore, do not EVER feel that you can help her pain by harming yourself. I know it can hurt, seeing someone you love harm themselves, but the only person who can help them is them. Do what you can, but always remember that. </TEXT>

First one killed himself five minutes after they left by running around and wrapping the chain around his neck (15 minutes before the dogsitter arrived), the second was the only dog to ever bite me, the third and fourth had to be fostered by someone else because they tried to kill each other and the family cats. </TEXT>

Several of my friends weren't able to go home for Thanksgiving (although they are getting a good dinner from another friend), and I hope to send them home with some leftovers, since I can afford it. So, I'm planning on something untraditional, since I get sick of turkey in a few days. Does this menu sound good?

Dr. Pepper glazed ham (had it last year and everyone seemed to like it)

Curried butternut squash risotto (another favorite from last year, and a decent vegetarian entree)

Roasted mixed veggies (I'm thinking turnips, beets, parsnips, and carrots)

Green beans with almonds

Brioche to go with it all (making brioche is awesome)

And pain au chocolat for dessert (making croissants is even more awesome). </TEXT>

Spicy glazed carrots are also good. I usually saute the carrots for a bit, then glaze with a brown sugar, sriracha, and water reduction.

These are both things I serve at my Friendsgiving, since I have a lot of vegetarian friends. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Mine are technically Katrine and Guillaume (former French major). Kate because everyone I've ever met woth that name is super feisty (my dad only calls my mom that when she's being feisty, haha), and Bill because I hold the belief that all ginger cats should be named after Weasleys, haha.

I couldn't imagine fostering that many! Kate was a foster failure, I only got Bill because she needed a friend. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's still a good idea to get a round of rabies shots after getting bitten, just in case.

My mom got bitten by one that got into the house earlier this year, and the doctor told her to go through with the shots. Sadly, even with insurance, it was $2400 for the whole thing, and it apparently hurt like hell (especially the one directly into the wound the day of, but getting several in a couple weeks would suck anyway). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was one for two years in high school, and I always had the same early morning shift at the school. You get really attached to the people who come to your pool three times a week before work, and they get attached to you. They compliment you on your musical tastes, or tell you stories about "that time I saw Eric Clapton." They literally trust you with their lives, and they ask you about your swim meet that evening (a few of the guys who came in were either teachers or had children on the team). They ask how you're doing, and get excited when you tell them about your future.

It's been almost 4 years, but I still have a huge affection for "my old guys." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is exactly why I got cats instead of a dog (although I didn't intend on getting any pets until my former roommate decided to foster a kitten who stole my heart). Even a large single apartment isn't good to the type of dog I'd like, and class means I couldn't take a big Rottie or Newfie or Irish Wolfhound (my favorite) on as many long walks as he'd need. Once I move into a house with a big enough yard, I will get myself a nice big dog. </TEXT>

I will also suggest going on Amazon and buying what can only be described as tire chains for your feet. I will look them up later, but they're $25, and are perfect for those of us who have to walk everywhere on the ice. Saved me from several bad falls last winter. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> First off, it's great that you're cooking for your family, and that you enjoy cooking.

Don't get too down because they don't express their feelings on the intricacies of your cooking. Some people can't pick them up, and some people don't even realize what the different flavor combinations are that make something taste good. I cook for my friends fairly often, and, while they say it's good, they don't say "oh, the nutmeg is what makes this curry really good," or "this is perfectly spiced." </TEXT>
