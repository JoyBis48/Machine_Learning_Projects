	<TEXT> That's [apple scab](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_scab), caused by *Venturia inaequalis*. The tree is something in the apple family. Probably a crap apple.

Clean up all the leaves in the fall and burn them or give them to the city. Additionally you can spray a copper fungicide just before the leaves fall in autumn and spread a nitrogen fertilizer to help the leaves degrade.

I knew that degree would come in handy. Who wants a date?! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, with strawberries, you can propagate them asexually, so it doesn't matter.

Otherwise, breeders generally consider F7 lines to be inbred. 7 generations increases the homozygosity to 99.2%. 1-1/2^7
Once inbred, plants will generally come true from seed.

If inbreeding depression is a problem with the genera you are attempting to breed, then you need to select subpopulations as opposed to single plants. Say you make a cross, then grow all the seed from that cross. Then, select maybe half the plants and interbreed them. Grow them up again, select again. Each time you'll enrich in the genes you want without (hopefully) causing too much inbreeding. The minimum plants needed to prevent inbreeding within a population also depends on the genera.

So, you've got some research to do. </TEXT>
