	<TEXT> I noted in the description that I'm trying to find alternatives, like day-care or walkers. I have time outside of work to take care of it, and I understand it can't be left alone for 10 hours. So, would taking it to day-care while I'm at work be sufficient? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm definitely planning to rescue an adult (don't feel like dealing with having to look after a hyper/destructive puppy).
So hypothetically, if I could run with my Husky for 2 hours after work, would that be sufficient? I don't think I can leave it alone for 10 hours... 

As for dog walkers, what would be the best way to go about that? Have the walker take the Husky for a walk or two every day while I'm at work? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, on the weekends, sure I could run with it (maaaaybe not 50 miles). But during the weekdays, isn't that what the day-care would be for? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So I really want a Husky, but I'll be working full-time soon, meaning I'd be out of the house close to 10 hours per day. It's also not a big house, and has no fenced-in yard.

What can I do to make getting a Husky possible? Would taking it to a doggy day-care every weekday be okay for the dog? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I want an energetic dog that I can run with. I also think bigger dogs are adorable (which I acknowledge isn't the best reason for getting one). </TEXT>

	<TITLE> About to start working full time, and I want to get a dog. What breed should I get? </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm about to start working full time in a suburban area in Washington state; I'll be living alone and out of the apartment for 9-10 hours every weekday. I want a dog for companionship though, and am willing to do the needed grooming and exercising (1-1.5 hours per day), though I don't think I'll have a fenced-in yard.

I really want a Husky. I'd likely get an adult rescue (not a puppy); would it be too demanding?

Otherwise, other breeds I'd be interested in are Mastiffs, Australian Shepards or Shiba Inus. Would any of those suit my lifestyle better?


Edit: If I were to get a dog walker to walk the dog around midday (so the dog would never be alone for more than 4 hours or so), would a Husky be out of the question? </TEXT>
