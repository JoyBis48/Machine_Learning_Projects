	<TEXT> Yeah, I'm not worried about the mail, I know she'll hand that over. I'm just worried she wont give me the tax information. I'm pretty scared at this point but hopefully it will all work itself out. :/ </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you! I can't afford to take any prep courses, so I'm saving up for some LSAT books that are highly regarded online. Preparing on my own makes me a little nervous because sometimes I hardly have motivation to do everything else that's going on, but, I think it'll be fine! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, I live in Green Bay WI. This is really stereotypical, but gamedays during football season are absolutely amazing, especially if you're actually going to the games or just tailgating anywhere near Lambeau. Everyone is so nice. It's like having a huge family who you can drink with and party with and love the Packers with. It is a totally unreal experience and it was amazing to grow up here, and I'm not even that into sports, really!

Football is our religion here. It's not an exaggeration what you hear about the cheeseheads haha. Everyone takes their prom pictures at the stadium, a fancy night out is taking a loved one to one of the stadium restaurants, or a restaurant named after someone associated with the Packers...yeah. Everyone should visit Green Bay on a game day sometime haha </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This sounds weird, but force yourself to smile and laugh with other people. Even if you feel dead inside, eventually it becomes genuine, and if you are looking for things to laugh at, eventually you realize there are a lot of things in the world that can make you smile. I use this a lot for my depression, and it helps with other situations too. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> An "us" night, complete with food, movies, and lots and lots of sex and laughing. We have a fairly big group of friends who are constantly doing things and hanging out, and it's especially bad when everyone hasn't seen each other in a while. He's a good guy and hates saying no to people, so I feel like I have to compete to get his undivided attention sometimes. </TEXT>
