	<TEXT> Listen to Title Fight's album Hyperview. It's alternative rock but it's almost minimalist. I would suggest it if you enjoy listening to music as an aural experience since they play around a lot with the acoustics of the thing and make it sound very ambient for an alternative record, which is interesting to say the least. It's as if the sound kind of surrounds you from all sides as opposed to just going in your ears laterally, if that makes sense. It's also a very cohesive album so if you hear it in one sitting you'll enjoy it even more. Or if you can wait until July then listen to Tame Impala's new album it's called Currents. Or if you can't wait listen to some of the songs on it that are already out. They're a wonderful mix of, well, you can't really pin Tame Impala into a genre they're just great. They're basically every 60's and 70's band you ever loved reimagined and reconstructed. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My Bloody Valentine has not necessarily gotten better with age, but when you have a phenomenal record like Loveless coming out in 1991 and then 22 years later being able to put out M B V in 2013 with similar results really says something. It's really hard to top Loveless but M B V definitely makes me want to pull my hair out trying to choose between the two so that says something. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There's a French band called La Femme with a debut album called Psycho Tropical Berlin. Beware though they're pretty niche but great. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I' don't know what kind of music you like or tend to listen to normally but think 80's post-punk/new wave. Bands like Blondie, Devo, Dexy's Midnight Runners, Dire Straits, that stuff. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Honestly you can't hate on Ariana Grade for her song Love Me Harder. It is a great pop song, especially the production. But while you're on The Zombies, Time of the Season is amazing. The Beatles' I'm Only Sleeping is great. Honestly my definition of pop is pretty fluid it kind of merges into indie if you're going into the 21st century, in which case I would recommend The Virgins' debut album. </TEXT>
