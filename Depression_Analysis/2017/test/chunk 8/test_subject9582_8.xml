Cartman would have a fitting line here, "I do what I want!"

Chiris Colubus was the truest to the books I think, Cuaron had a pretty cinescape, and was close to to the script. I have nary a clue where Newell's head was. I thought Yates was good with finishing the series, but he was the only one who actually *added* scenes, and that shit drives me crazy.

1. He needed the blood of an enemy to regain his full body, and sure he could have used just about any witch or wizard in Britain because he was basically PE #1 at the time, but he chose Harry.

2. Which brings us to the second part, he used Harry's blood because he knew from Quirrellmort that he couldn't touch Harry without dying, so he took his blood in order to be able to. </TEXT>

He sent Snape to Voldemort, sent Lupin to the werewolves, Hagrid to the giants, Sirius was revealed as innocent, he regrouped the order and he did all of this within hours of Riddle's return.

Not to mention, Harry got the first hug that actually felt like it was from a mother.

	<TEXT> HBP is also my favorite book. I'm not really a fan of the films, but you could say the same.

Harry has that swagger going on, he is like his father, just.. cool. He's worried about Draco of course, and he uses a curse that [SPOILER] Snape taught him to battle Draco, the showdown we finally got to see.

When it came to The Cave, Harry did exactly as he was instructed to. He kept feeding Albus the potion in order to get the [SPOILER] locket from the basin. And then he even chases down Snape and Malfoy because [SPOILER] Snape killed Dumbledore.

IMO, HBP was the best 'whodunnit'. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Harry wasn't a true horcrux, this is BS.

EDIT: Horcruxes require a spell beforehand, and they are heavily protected by dark magic, none of this happened when the part of Tom Riddle's soul attached itself to the only other living thing in the house. The damn cat must have been out hunting.

EDIT2: You can downvote all you like, but She has stated this herself. Harry was not a *true* horcrux. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am going to disagree with the general consensus. Boba is an intergalactic bounty hunter, and I think he has the edge. He's seen all sorts of beings, and I'm almost sure Jango taught him a few tricks of the trade. The first BAMF to escape the sarlaac definitely gets the win. </TEXT>
