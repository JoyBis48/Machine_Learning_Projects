	<TEXT> I just tried.  I got laughed at on the phone.  She didn't know what I was asking, so I told her about top gear and how they race on tarmac, and there's no track around here, so how much would it cost to rent the tarmac for an afternoon?  They won't let me do that.  That was sort of embarrassing getting laughed at by the lady at the aeroport. O.o.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was on acid, but my end table turning into this strange machine that had gears and pulleys, and wheels and belts, and ramps and belts, and there were a bunch of 2" tall people running around making this machine work.  I couldn't figure out what the hell they were making, or what the machine was supposed to do, but it was the coolest thing I ever saw.  LSD is a hell of a drug, and you can see some amazing shit that is mind boggling.

**EDIT:**  I couldn't figure out what the hell they were doing, but I didn't try to engage and just watched it trying to figure out what the hell they were doing.  Whatever those mini-people were doing, they looked busy, so I didn't want to disturb them.  I had this thought of "Woah, what if this is how power really works?" and was looking for wires, but couldn't find any.  Since I couldn't figure out what the hell they were doing, I just watched. 20m later *poof* gone.  Then I decided to walk outside, and I "felt the gas station".  That was the coolest thing I ever felt. :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was up at Stateline about 10 years ago, and they let you race if you have a seatbelt, (or not if your rig was made before 63 or so), and have a $10 bill for admittance for an hour.  I just called the LC airport to see if they'll let me use a runway for an afternoon. :)  That's really the only option I have if I want to keep it off the streets.  I got that idea from Top Gear.  They race on aeroport tarmac, so maybe I can too?  IDFK?  Worth a shot though.

I saw a jetcar explode, and a stock car race.  Watching a high speed collision live is a hell of a lot different than on TV.  I saw that car flip 5 times and land on it's wheels.  The crowd was silent as a grave.  I wanted to see cars go fast, not have a wreck and get towed out after the EMT's and the fire truck came out and made sure the dude was alive.  O.o  I didn't have enough balls to get on the track after seeing that.

**EDIT:**  And now you know why I get into street drags on occasion, but after seeing a couple of videos on this forum, I don't want to do that anymore because even if I was Dale Earnhardt, shit happens.  I remember that race too.  I want to keep it off of the street. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not one anymore, but in my youth I did a lot of shit.

* Keep your car locked, most thefts are opprotunistic crimes.

* Take your keys with you, and roll up your windows.  I never took a rig without easy access to it.  (1998 camaros haul ass BTW)

* Make sure you have a secondary ignition interlock, even if they have a screwdriver and a a hammer, it's not going to do much good if they can't find the secondary ignition switch.

* Surprisingly enough, a push button and a ignition toggle lever.  Most thieves (well kids), want to have a good time, and not jack your rig.  They won't be able to figure it out, and will leave you alone even if they do gain access.

* keep your rig clean on the interior.  Messy car = easy target.  Nobody's really going to notice if I'm driving a broken down ford that looks like a rolling trash can with a broken ignition switch. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes they were.  They were also the first to institute the draft, and print "greenbacks" backed up by nothing, and to institute an income tax to fund the war effort, and rationing of goods to the civilian population.  They also had such a strict "defend the homeland" policy, that they rarely left their "territory".  Had they firebombed DC, they likely could have forced the north to come to terms of peace.  Sherman later did that to Atlanta in 1864-1865 during his "march to the sea".  

Preemptive strikes work, when done correctly.  Imagine the Union's reaction to WDC, NYC, Boston, and Phillidephia being razed to the ground.  It would have been humiliating to the northern efforts to contain the rebels, and likely would have worked. </TEXT>

And it would be different than just not existing, because you're conscious the whole time and you can think of every waking moment.  Imagine looking out to see .... nothing. but you're fully conscious of it.  I'd be begging for my sidearm at that point, and I would only need 1 round.

**EDIT:**  You would go insane.  Look up sensory deprivation.  Most people can last about 72 hours from what I've researched.  I don't mean lock up, I mean total sensory deprivation.  That is the ultimate form of torture.  At least I've practiced for sucking dick by deep throating hot dogs.

	<TEXT> Can you imagine that?  "The Last Perfect Day", and then it gets hotter, the sun gets brighter, and then it becomes insufferably hot, and then all of the organic matter around you starts wilting and dying off, then spontaneous combustion becomes a very real thing, then the world literally catches fire., then the atmosphere is blown off into space, and all of the water on the planet.  Plate techtonics break down because the surface is molten, and the planet it turned into a ball of molten rock, and then completly engulfed by the Sun, and vaporised.  

The only trace of the Earth left would be a slightly higher iron and sulphur and sodium content in the sun.  Then the sun collapses, and earth is gone forever, (and venus and mercury).  Mars would likely survive as a burnt out husk like mercury is today, and the rest of the planets would be unaffected.  I think I would rather just shoot myself. </TEXT>

Not even electrons would exist, and the only thing existing would be some photons, some quantum particles and you?  Alone, forever, in a universe with nothing, and you still live on.  That would be hell, knowing that the entire universe you know and are familiar with is obliterated, but you keep on living on ..... forever.

I think I would rather eat a bullet than see that. I take solace knowing I will never exist to see that day. The thought of eternal life is far more terrifying than knowing that yes, one day, I just stop existing. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  I wish ... I'd live forever

Really?  Want to be alive when the sun engulfs the Earth in about 5 billion years, want to live to see the sun get so large that the atmosphere is blown away into the vacuum of space, the oceans boil off, and the mountains melt?  Then the sun expands, and engulfs the earth, only to vaporize it?  And you get to see it all?  Living to see everything you ever known, cared about, and ever seen, just engulfed by the dying sun?  

I think I would rather eat a bullet than see that.  I take solace knowing I will never exist to see that day.  The thought of eternal life is far more terrifying than knowing that yes, one day, I just stop existing. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We all die.  Shit happens.  It's unavoidable.  It's nothing to be feared, after I die, I won't even exist, so why fear what I can't feel, sense, taste, or touch?  Might as well feat the Space Jews stealing all the moon money.  It just makes no sense to fear death.  Hell, my house could collapse on me right now and crush me under a couple of hundreds of tonnes right now.  The USSR could launch now, and vaporise me in 45m.  Why fear what I can't control?

To put a reverse on an old country song, it's not the thought of being dead, it's the thought of dying that is sort of frightening.  If the soviets launch, well, I won't feel a damned thing.  I'll just be non-existent one millisecond.  If my house collapses for some reason, I might be trapped for several days before expiring.  I think I would rather die in a thermonuclear explosion. </TEXT>

A black man walks into the sheriff's office to register to vote in Alabama.  He goes to pass the literacy test.

The Sheriff says "Can I help you son?"

The black man says "Yes sir, I came to pass my literacy test to vote."

The sheriff hands him a newspaper in Chinese, and asks the black man "Can you read that?"

The black man looks at the paper and sadly states, "Yes sir, I can.  It says here that "No niggers going to vote in this county."  He turns and walks out the door after setting down the paper on the sheriff's desk. </TEXT>

He won't hit me if I don't take it on the public roads".  My grandpa just said "OK, be careful, and don't wreck!"  But he didn't care after that.

	<TEXT> Correct.  WWII would have likely never happened.  (or at around 1960 between the USSR and USA, but it would have been conventional since the atomic bomb would have not been developed in this ATL).  But if the USA remained COMPLETELY neutral in WWI, both the USA and USSR would have likely remained isolationist, so we might still be referring to WWI as "The Great War".

	<TEXT> Wouldn't work.  What if the passenger needs to make a call?  What if, like in 1998 when I was coming up the lewiston hill, somebody coming the other way down flashes his lights at you because you think there is a cop ahead, so you slow down; then you come around a corner and A VEHICLE IS HEADING RIGHT FOR YOU ON A DIVIDED HIGHWAY! 

I cut off a semi, and picked up on my phone, and called 911 to let them know about it, then got on my CB (chan 9), and let "ALL HEADING SOUTHBOUND ON US 95!  ALL HEADING SOUTHBOUND ON US 95!  THERE IS A LARGE VEHICLE HEADING NORTH IN THE SOUTHBOUND LANES ON THE LEWISTON HILL!  I REPEAT!  THERE IS A LARGE VEHICLE HEADING IN THE SOUTHBOUND LANES TO NORTH!  DIVIDED HIGHWAY!!"  

Within 10s of my call, I could hear the sirens behind me.  That was a legitimate emergency, so you bet your fucking ass I'm using my phone and CB!

Yes, I missed him by less that 30 feet.  That was fucking scary.  Had it not been for my phone and radio, who knows how large that accident would have been.  Technologically prohibiting cell phone use in a moving vehicle isn't a solution, education is. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I came across it, and I had to turn it off.  My wife was texting and driving with me in the car.  If she was my daughter, I would have taken her damned phone and thrown it out the window.  I made my wife watch it.  She went white at the head on scene, and started crying at the kid asking mommy and daddy to wake up, and almost puked at the dead baby scene.  I'm thinking about taking her to a wrecking yard and seeing in person what happens when you text and drive.  Somebody in HS did that to me when she heard I was racing on busy public streets.  I got drug out to her truck, and she forced me to actually open up the vehicle and take a look inside.  She then shoved my head in and "smell that?  That's death.  That's what you're causing by racing on US195!  Keep up what you're doing, and you're going to be smelling this!  You will be the cause! This vehicle was going 131 on US195!  Do you want to see who they hit?"  All I could say was "no." and sounded like a child that just got beat by his mom.  I was crying at that point, and she drug me back to her truck and we went back to school.  I never raced on the highway again.  (I'll race on empty ones, but not that one, it's just too busy, and I might kill somebody).  There's nothing like the smell of curdled blood and some hair and skull to remind you DON'T RACE ON OPEN ROADS!.  I got hit after she heard about that, and I deserved it.

**TL;DR:** DON'T RACE!  DON'T TEXT AND DRIVE! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Like I was her own kid.  She was raising me since I was 2yo, and I would rather run to my step mom than my birth mom for help.  My sister and I were the only kids "she ever had".  She got pregnant in 1998 because she wanted a "kid of her own", but changed her mind 6 weeks into it, because "I already have kids".  

My birth mother is fucking useless, but my step mom stepped in several times in grade school and raised hell because I was coming home with marks on me.  She told my dad to stop sending me over to joe's house because he would beat me.  My step mom basically **WAS** my mother, and did all of the things moms do, and dad did what dads do.  

My birth-mother was a negligent parent, and had no reason to even have me for once a week until I was 7.  Although I call her by her first name, she's "mom" to me.  There are billions of people called "mom", or "mum", but only one XXXXX in my mind.  So I call her by her first name, (and have all my life), as a sign of respect.  She only slapped me twice. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My father made me pay my own insurance.  Because I used to be hell on wheels in my 1977 Chevrolet Impala Coupe, (that I dropped a 350 in with dual quads, Yay 4MPG!) I had so many speeding tickets, and "Excessive display of horsepower" tickets that I paid $169/mo in insurance, and had a probationary license.  (I was getting stopped about once every 3 months).  I rolled my car when I was 14 years old, (been driving on the family ranch since 12), and got into my head on collision at 16 years old. </TEXT>

I know police have utility beyond speeders (or dui busts), on the highway, but I'm asking about how they used to monitor speed before radar guns existed. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I live in a duplex.  I have 3 bedrooms, and 2 baths.  I have 2 designated parking spots, and W/S/G included with the rent.  I use one of the bedrooms for a shop, and the other bedroom is completly empty.  I even keep the door shut to that room, and the vent is shut off in that room.  I have 2 floors.  The bedrooms (and 1 bath), are upstairs; and the living room, "dining room" (that I just use to make my living room bigger), kitchen, laundry room, and small downstairs bathroom are located downstairs.  I live in what would be classified as a semi-urban area.  I'm on College hill in Pullman WA. </TEXT>

"shhh billy let your daddy do his job"

gags you with his hand, and silently pumps away

"You like that Billy, don't you?"

forces your head to make the "yes" motion, and goes faster and puts a cowboy hat on your head

"WOO"

Slaps your ass with the side of his pillock and gives you a mushroom print on your ass, then kisses you on the cheek, and goes even faster pumping away

"WOO!"

You just got raped by Rick Flair, and he's your dad. :D </TEXT>
