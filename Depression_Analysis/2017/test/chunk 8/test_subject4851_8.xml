	<TEXT> You are actually in agreement, even though your first words are in contradiction with everything else you/I have said. Education is not equivalent to college. There are many many forms of education. But, a ward of the state must be offered some training to become useful in society. Failure to fulfill this obligation, on the part of the state, is leaving such a person to do what they must to survive, which, unfortunately, very often leads to a life of 'crime'.

So yes, your initial description is spot on. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Young people of Reddit: Free education is, beyond a shred of doubt, the most important factor for growth and development both for the individual and for collective society. Do you think this should be the primary issue in the next presidential and congressional election? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> I'm sorry man. Thank you for clarifying what you intended to say. 
But, because of where I am from, I can not but reject your logic. If desperation is a licence to forsake virtue, then all is lost. Case in point: much of Sub-Saharan Africa. Many of these people can be considered 'descent' human beings as evidenced when they migrate and are immersed into 'developed'/'stable' economies in Europe or America. But take a look at the turmoil, violence, corruption and all manner of ills which, according to your logic, is perfectly acceptable because they are 'starving' to death.

	<TEXT> Cool. I'm almost done with my graduate studies. I'm trying to learn German in the hopes to do a postdoc and work a few years as a researcher there before I move to Africa where I feel there is a much more serious need for education and, to a smaller degree, applied research. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There is no where in the world that says this is what financial aid should be. You describe the status quo, which is broken. For a civilized country, a well educated citizenry is the only way to remain civilized. This is the primary role/function of any state. It is the very reason for its existence!

	<TEXT> Look at this guy. First you ask me to agree to disagree and then you hit me with something I agree with! Just who do you think you are?!
Yes, clearly the planet has gone to shyt with very many people who should not be on this earth. Except they are here because people created an environment suitable for them.
What I think we agree to disagree on is what to do about them. You killing people is different from them dying.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The only place I see a difference is when you are defending a loved one or someone who is in immediate danger, and even in this case, as a last resort.
Note here that the overriding thought is to protect, help, save, these are all good things. But when you delve into the realm of revenge, the overriding thoughts are to inflict pain, suffering, etc never anything benevolent.
I believe it is the volition (thought/wish) behind an act that determines whether it is right or wrong (good or bad). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You're not entitled to making or fabricating hypothetical interpretations where there are facts. According to the accounts Joseph owned his own shop. So hinting that he 'could have been employed by someone else' is just making things up.
But you can maintain your opinion, you are free to have them. Just pointing out that it is wrong. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is a common but deliberate misconception about Him. Joseph owned his own carpenter shop. Think small business owner and a healthy middle class family - no excessive wealth but also not poor. He was well to do. Being a carpenter and owning your own business with several employees isn't being poor!

Edit: Ah yes. Down vote facts because they do not conveniently agree with your self delusions. </TEXT>
