	<TEXT> Start with the name,  "Jamb"=jambon or ham, sausage, tasso but can be chicken, seafood etc.; "ala"= a la, with or everything; "Ya"=African for rice.  
Start with the holy trinity, add seasonings, protein of choice, rice, then tomatoes and stock. Cook until rice is al dente.  The dish is usually heavily seasoned depending on the protein.  It should be somewhat "wet" like a rice casserole so that it sticks together instead of "dry" like a rice pilaf.     </TEXT>

	<TEXT> While there's no hard and fast rule, Jambalayas usually have tomatoes, tomato sauce or both.  With the addition of black-eyed peas your dish looks more like a dressed up version of Hopping John's.  Not that that's a bad thing but it's not what I consider cajun Jambalaya to be.  Note: Spent 10 years cooking in New Orleans.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I went to a grocery store in San Diego to purchase a money order.  When I got home I realized I had $100 too much and the clerk must have messed up the transaction so my husband and I went back and told the clerk.  He called his supervisor and they counted down the register but no discrepancies showed up.  We went on to shop in the store and as we were about to check out the clerk ran up to us and said they finally found the discrepancy and his manager had offered us 2 free deli sandwiches for the $$$.  I could have messed with this young man but I gave him the $100.00 back knowing that if I made a mistake like that it would have been a god-send for a customer to return a $100.00 mistake except that it wasn't a god-send since I'm an Atheist and have empathy for someone in that position.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Okay, this one I did all by myself.  At my first duty station I made some pie dough using the Armed Forces Recipe Cards.  It listed every ingredient on the front except for water.  I made what I thought looked like a perfect pie dough for 300 portions of Cobbler.  Refrigerated it before rolling it out, it then rolled out beautifully with no cracks and baked off to a perfect golden brown.  I didn't discover how important a little bit of water was until they tried to cut up the pie and the crust instantly turned to dust!   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> On a destroyer I was stationed on we had 4 five gallon buckets of used fryer oil stored on the deck in the galley that was all of about 150 sq ft.  We were expecting high-speed maneuvers that day and secured everything we possibly could however, no one thought to check that the lids were tight and the buckets could not move around.  All four buckets spilled at the same time.  Since this was a ship we first had to stop as much of the oil from going down the drain and scoop up as much oil as possible all the while the ship was still in maneuvers, left then right at angles of about 30 degrees.  This happened right after securing for lunch.  Took about four hours to finally clean up the mess and we still managed to prepare dinner in time.  Everyones fault because no one checked.  Wish someone had been able to make a video!

	<TEXT> Yes, it was a version that a young couple brought to Austin in 1972 to people that never heard of a muffuletta.  The big difference is the bread and olive tapenade. 

I worked at a Schlotsky's in Jr High School in 1981 when it was all about the sandwich.  The bread was delivered in the mornings fully baked so the recipe was kept secret.  
Schlotsky's bread is what sets it apart from a Muff. and I should know since I lived there for nine years.  Muffs use a round Italian.  Schlotz uses a recipe that combines a Sourdough starter with a  English muffin type bread and they are very protective of the recipe! </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  There's a historical explanation for this.  The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 effectively stopped all immigration from China to the US and many Chinese who were already here were not allowed to return if they left the US who still had family here.  
 This caused many Chinese to immigrate to Mexico where many opened restaurants or became street vendors.  In the meantime, the Chinese practically invented human smuggling to the US.  
 Consequently the Mexicans, particularly along the border have developed a particularly refined palate for Chinese/Asian food.  Most of the best Chinese/Japanese restaurants in Texas employ a Chef Martinez or Chef Rodriquez as head chef.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When guys say that what they really mean is they believe women can't handle the pressure of being a professional in the industry.
  
To them their mother probably made the best whatever.  With a few exceptions, no one could make it like she could.  Mom was always depicted at being able to cook the perfect Thanksgiving turkey with all the sides plus desserts for 20 family members and look good while doing it in heals! Plus FOH duties which included the table settings and seasonal decor.  Women were perfectly suited to cook in the home for family and manage organizational stress but never in the Big Ole' Capitalist Marketplace.

We're just delicate flowers that need squashi....'er protection.  News Flash...--.--..Women are as capable as men in working under pressure either in Food Service or as US Navy Combat fighters.

 It's a perception thing that screws women out of a fair wage.  Women can be wonderful cooks and great organizers but not when it comes to being a professional because only men are perceived that can do that. </TEXT>

"Where exactly does the half come from? Are you giving me half of someone elses sandwich, or do I have to wait for someone else to order the other half?..........You can't make a half of a sandwich, a half of a whole sandwich is just a small sandwich!"

I wanted to ask for some of my money back in tuition when my chef/instructor admonished me in front of a guest that a small tasting plate I presented as a Croque Monsieur with a wine pairing was actually a Croque Madame (because it was smaller) even though there was no fried/poached egg!

	<TEXT> Exactly,  If Jesus was God then he can't be killed.  Only changed back into his original form which was not a sacrifice for God and himself.  Considering the amount of suffering and death of ordinary humans, Jesus ranks really low. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> While I like the passage you refer to it does not reflect a true sacrifice.  Much like the Peter Pan story, everyone must give up their childhood in order to become an adult.  What Jesus was saying here was not to love your earthly existence but to instead look forward to an everlasting life with God.  If that is the case then there was no sacrifice since the inevitable outcome was to become something greater.  A true sacrifice means a loss without compensation and that never happened with the Crucifixion of Jesus.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was an Admiral's cook at a Flag Mess.  Worked many parties at his quarters.  When the parties started to wind down his wife, who herself held a high level civilian position in DC,  would come back into the kitchen, tell me to grab a "drink" and we would go out back to talk, smoke and commiserate.  She hated most of the O wives.  Most down to earth woman I've ever met.   </TEXT>
