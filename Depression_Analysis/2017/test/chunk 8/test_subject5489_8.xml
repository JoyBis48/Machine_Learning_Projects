	<TEXT> You've allowed what others think of you to be offensive, instead of embracing it. You take power away when you hold it to your heart, not shun it away in disgust. You mention stereotypes over and over again, all I hear is lack of confidence from within. Embrace those ideas, they come from somewhere, and it's really, really funny once you stop caring about what others think of you.

 Let go </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Art can most certainly be offensive. And you've allowed it to do such. But why? Does femininity scare you? Should all gay men be machismo? Should we ignore our history in drag, of Stonewall, of gender bending, of camp, of flamboyance, all for the prevalence of leading, dominating, and repressive heterosexual culture?

I think we have and do. </TEXT>

The bank does work with the local Pride parade. It's art for fun's sake.

It's hardly offensive, it's just fun. Also, it's in one of the most progressive cities on earth for gay rights. The bank, the city, the people have a history with LGBT culture.

...did I also mention it's just, like, art? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah I wanted to post something from Temple Grandin, where she talks about dogs loving that small space, like a cave or a den (couldn't find a good direct quote off the inter webs). 

Though if someone did something to a beta dog in the past, like hurt the pup in a corner, or just ignore them in a kennel for hours and hours, we have to work in baby steps to regain the trust and go forward. Prettttttty sure you get that. Cool. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sorry to hijack this thread too, but I just noticed the 'breed'.

Shibu Inus are high energy, been used for hunting small game for years. Chows, while not so energetic, definitely have a job. Protecting large spaces, patrolling. 

My siberian husky, similar spitz like mentality, strongly dislikes being constricted, limited in mobility. Even as a dog groomer, I muzzle him start to finish.

The only thing that calms him down, allowing me to man-handle him or put him in any size kennel I want? Exercise. A jerby-jerb. He get's out his 'husky drive', I don't have to deal with his anxiety. Just another idea... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ouch. Yeah rescues can be tricky. You never know what they've been through in their past.

Have you tried baby steps? Gated area with you in the room. Good behavior? Treats. Make the gated area smaller. More treats. Work your way down. Good behavior means treats. Talking does little. Her flight or fight response has to be met with no acknowledgement. Baby steps to a kennel without you there.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I had a lot of difficulty socializing and handling stress in a healthy way my first.... pretty much 3 months.

You got some good ideas though! Exercise, MA meetings, prayer, meditation, drinking tons of water, not drinking caffeine or alcohol, all great things that have worked for some people!

I also liked having a creative outlet. I like poetry, personally. So I wrote a lot. Loud music. Playing with neighbors'  dogs. Eating my favorite foods. Sex with my boyfriend all the time (Idk i guess my sex drive came back 100 fold). Channels to move our emotions. Escapism, no. That's what our pot smoking was. This is giving our interests a chance to come back with the weird, awkward 'pink cloud' of the first 3 months.

It's a weird and kind of awesome time.

Mandatory, congrats on being sober! Woot woot! </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2015-01-26 22:35:45 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Spotted a male Romanian mioritic shepherd dog at a coffee shop. I only know this cause the owner told me about his breed history and personal story.

He flew to California on AirFrance from Transylvania. His brothers are herding dogs (this will be an important detail in a bit.) He hates squirrels with a passion, but instead of biting them, he bats them like baseballs with his monster paws.

In Romania, he has three brothers (probably more but the breeder keeps three males). The brothers are raised together with the herder, the flock, and a donkey. The donkey is sometimes the first line of defense from bears and wolves. If the donkey is attacked by a bear, the brothers get in formation. Two brothers will distract the bear by barking and swiping their paws. The third brother will sneak from behind and attack the bear's back legs. This could go on for hours, with the bear then running away, never messing with said flock again.

As the owner was telling me this story in a thick Transylvanian accent, the dog was circling me, he was working me. So cool. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Without going in to too many details, I was guided by a local to pick up a specific stink bug or shield bug. I was then instructed to place the bug in my mouth (alive). The insect released a chemical that tasted EXACTLY like Big Red. I've been on the search for the binomial nomenclature ever since, as my guide just nick named them 'cinnamon bugs'. 

Habitat: Leaf litter near stream beds and riparian forests.

Size? Color?: Not exceptional large, I believe it was either all brown/tan/patterned, though it may have had red markings.

Any ideas? </TEXT>

 Hello! I'm sorry for the late reply but Facebook doesn't alert me of all the comments posted on the pictures 

 Thank you so much for your interest in my work, I'm very glad you like it.
At the moment I don't have prints or originals available for sale, I'm planning on having some art prints soon, I'll post it on this page and let you know when I have them ready. Thank you again, have a great weekend!
