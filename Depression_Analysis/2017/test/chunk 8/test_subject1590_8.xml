	<TEXT> Maybe you are right, but I'd argue that there are very few names that get remembered over time (this is not to say Villa is bad).

Just consider Spain alone, in the past 10 years or so, I'd say Xavi, Iniesta, Casillas, Raul are bigger names than him (not comparing skills here, just saying these names are more well-known), and probably Puyol, Ramos are at his level. There you've got 7 or 8 names already for that decade, so in 50 years basically there would be 40 or so players of, roughly speaking, his level or better. I doubt anyone could remember 40 names from one country (even if it's your country) unless if something special happened that made you remember him.

And plus, people tend to remember more recent players and forget old ones. How many players from the 1960s can you name? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Before you ask this question, you will need to define what legend is. If we are taking about legend as in someone who is, at some point, one of the best players for a top country/club, then I think he is. But if we are talking about legend as one one who could be remembered/recognized 30 or 50 years later (e.g. Maradona, Zidane etc), then I think no. </TEXT>

I think as a Chinese player playing at his level, the state will have an important say on your career, perhaps even more than you and your family.

	<TITLE> ELI5: How does contango and backwardation affect non-commodity futures? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-07-08 15:26:06 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I am reading about contango and backwardation. Essential, if I am understanding correctly, contango is when t futures price (or forward price) of a commodity is higher than the expected price today. So basically, does that mean if the price of some commodity stays constant, the price of their futures will still drop because of contango?

How does this affect non-commodity futures such as VIX futures? Do they suffer from contango as well? If so, does that mean the price of VIX futures will drop even if the VIX index remains constant for a period of time?

And finally, what futures are examples of backwardation?  </TEXT>
