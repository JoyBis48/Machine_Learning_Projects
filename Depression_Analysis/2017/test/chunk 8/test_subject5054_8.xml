	<TEXT> That's one of my favorites as well. I really liked Dalton as Bond. Him and Craig portray/ed a fairly similar Bond.

Golden Eye is probably my favorite though because it was the first one I saw and I got to see it in theaters as a 7 year old. Still remember my dad jokingly covering my eyes during the sexual scenes with Xenia.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What did you think of Youth Lagoon? I credit 'The Year of Hibernation' as the catalyst for a lot of the good things that have happened in my life over the past 2 years. I was, almost exclusively, spurred into going to Outside Lands in San Francisco last August to see YL. I thought the show was great (as was the whole festival) and that trip ended up leading to an amazing group of friends, a deconstruction of my previously self-destructive social/general anxiety, and lots of fun in between.

	<TEXT> Sorry. I'll be more tactful.

At a gas station buy water, mineral water or unsweet tea for a drink and almonds or peanuts or jerky (careful as some have a lot of added sugar but it's easy to find some with minimal - which isn't a bad thing) as a snack.

You're right, it's not easy but it is simple. You just have to adjust the way you approach purchasing food. I was in the same boat and felt the same way you do, but with a little bit of foresight and willpower, it's easy to not consume heavily processed junk food. Buy fruits at the grocery store, take them with you. Buy frozen fruit (i prefer raspberries which are very low in sugar and blueberries) and [edemame](http://www.seapointfarms.com/new_products_pages/lightly-salted.html) for quick and easy snacks that are high in fiber, protein and vitamins.

Drink hot tea or black coffee. Buy chicken breast (bags of frozen chicken breasts are cheap, healthy and easy to work with). Buy seasonal vegetables. Canned tuna is extremely healthy, make a tuna salad with 0% greek yogurt, celery, and whatever else you like in it. If you have to have bread/pastas buy whole wheat with the least amount of sugars (though those carbs are broken down to sugar so even 'sugar free' bread technically has sugars).

Get a crock pot, make stews with lots of vegetables and some meat. Lentils, quinoa, black beans are great sources of fiber and protein, are cheap and are filling.

You'll find it gets easier and easier to adjust your eating and buying habits the further along you go. I consume very little food which has added sugar and it just takes a little bit of self control to get there.

Good luck and sorry if I was an asshole earlier, just trying to help out.

Lost about 80 pounds the past 18 months by adjusting my habits. Cutting out that (excess) sugar is so worth it and I hope you manage to make it a reality.

	<TEXT> Hey Yao!

First I just wanted to say that I'm a huge Rockets fan and you and T-Mac were my favorite players of the 00s. It was truly a privilege watching you play, laugh, joke and be an ambassador for the sport of basketball and for your home country of China.

I've got a question about basketball and a question about your humanitarian work, I'll start with basketball.

What was your favorite moment from your career on the Rockets? My greatest memory was the playoff game against the Lakers were you went to the locker room with an apparent injury, only to emerge a bit later in the game to lead your team to the win in LA.

You've already had a successful public campaign against the consumption of shark fin, and now what will surely be a successful campaign in Africa. What will be the next big project you tackle? Will you follow in the trend of a humane approach to animal protection or do you see yourself shifting towards other projects and problems? Also, would you ever consider teaming up with Deke as two towers of humanitarian work?

Thanks for using your global appeal to change the world for the better. We need more people like you out there that aren't afraid to use their fame, stature and respect to change the world for the better and it was an absolute privileged watching you play basketball.

	<TEXT> Stop fucking shopping at convenience stores. Buy food that isn't in packages. Drink liquids that don't have sugar. It's essy, you're just conditioned to think otherwise because you don't know how to shop. There are so many options, but if you expect to eat what you were eating before just minus sugar yeah you're gonna have a problem. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Why the fuck can't we just enjoy things without worrying whether or not it's true? Jesus Christ, you aren't a fucking detective. Just enjoy, it was a good story and was well written. Yet you whine that it's not "true" enough for your standards.


This bullshit ruins posts. Him writing a fictional story didn't ruin the post, your need for whatever the fuck you're looking for when you go detective mode ruins the post. Why the hell can't you people just suspend reality for 2 seconds, read the story, react to it and move on. You don't have to treat it like the gospel.

Yeesh.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, but you can't value a player based on his team.

Eh, I disagree man. Morey matches that offer sheet if Bosh had signed with us. The market dictated his value so high because team(s) were willing to overpay based on their teams contract situations (Rockets w/ being able to sign RFA over the cap   Mavs w/ Dirk taking a major paycut).

I do however think this was a very unique situation which we won't see again for a long time.

And agreed that he'll be impossible to trade if they ever want to.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not even talking about stats; Parsons had 29 last night. I'm talking about cohesion, chemistry and their complimentary skill sets. This year's team hums like a machine whereas last year's squad seemed to step on each other's toes frequently which would grind the train to a stop. Harden/Lin/Parsons all had similar offensive repoitoires which would create knots in the offense. Now Harden has free reign of the mid range, and shooters on the wings. You know, in theory.  </TEXT>
