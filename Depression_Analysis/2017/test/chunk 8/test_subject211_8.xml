	<TEXT> I fired the event and it gave me a window saying "you're not supposed to see this" I selected the only option and I got the window saying the election was over with a random lowborn receiving over 2000 votes and he was the only candidate. I took this to be a glitch and killed him with console, upon his death the elections began again and they went through without a hitch with me being elected.

Thanks for the help. I feel really appreciative that someone on the mod team would help me troubleshoot this. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not sure if any other candidates died or not. But the odd thing is I've played for a bit more at this point and its been a good 20-25 years since our last president. I noticed the "election season nears a close" event thing hasn't fired yet. Is there any way I could get it to fire manually via console? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> After the end Americanist election glitch. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-05-14 22:45:43 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I'm playing as an Americanist character in the 'After the End' mod and I control what is pretty much the largest realm in the game. Other than some characters down in Florida I also control all Americanist characters and provinces. So, the president of the USA died a few years ago and since then I have been campaigning the become the next president. I have the overwhelming majority of votes, with over 1000 whereas my closest competitor only has 80-ish. But the problem is that the election has been running for the past 5 years. I tried restarting my game twice and it didn't fix the glitch. My best guess is that it hasn't triggered the 'elections nearly over' event yet, so it hasn't ended the elections.

Anyone got any ideas to fix this? </TEXT>
