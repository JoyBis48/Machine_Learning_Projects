	<TEXT> It's hard to compare the two because Fight Club is this weird combo of surreal comedy/drama whereas The Game is a psychological thriller. I feel like The Game is more accessible to wider audiences because it's easier to get in to. It has a, for the most part, straight forward story that, while there may be a lot of twists, it's still easy to follow what's going on.

While on the other hand I find Fight Club harder to recommend to people because of how strange it is. It breaks the fourth wall, jumps around in time, lots of narration, it's very cynical, satirical, dark humor, at times offensive, and other times brutally violent all while maintaing this overall sense of humor and satire. I love it more than The Game, but The Game is much easier to digest. And because it's a lesser known Fincher film, I feel you'd have a better time finding people to watch it with that don't know about it, whereas Fight Club? Pretty much everyone knows about it.

All in all I like Fight Club more and think it's better than The Game, but I go to them for different reasons because they are different. While they are both good WTF movies. Fight Club only gets WTF towards the end while The Game is WTF pretty much throughout. Also, I find The Game to be Fincher's least Fincher movie, but that's just me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> By your logic then, Memento could totally hang with the likes of those films. You say what makes the movies you listed "bold" is that they demand something from the viewer. Memento totally demands the attention of the viewer as well as multiple viewings if you want to truly understand it all. You said Nolan isn't difficult or bold. Maybe to a lover of film like yourself. But to the general public he is. I know plenty of people that cannot sit through Memento or Inception because of the complexity of those films. To the average moviegoer, these films hurt your head to think about and they aren't the kinds of movies you can just turn your brain off for. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I just wanna see Birdman. It's apparently not playing anywhere in or around the city. What's up with that?

We get The Guest which is a super small indie film, heck we get small indie films all the time, why wouldn't we get a star studded film that has gotten critical acclaim?

Is it the theater choosing not to show it or is it the film distributer not wanting to show it here?

Just thought it was super weird. Memphis theaters are always unpredictable when it comes to indie films, but I thought Birdman would surely be here. 

Anyone know of any place that is showing it that I'm just unaware of? I only checked Malco and Ayjay cinemas. Are there any other movie theaters in or around the city? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I glanced over the doc(I'll read more in depth latter) and most of that stuff I'm aware of and hasn't really affected me. I'm definitely aware of the LGBT issues due to my cousin being gay. I can't say I agree with their stance on that. I think that since I'm aware of most of this stuff it doesn't affect me. By that I mean I don't agree with most of it and I don't act out any of it. None of the stuff really directly affects me. Now if I was a woman, it'd be different because of how much it *would* directly affect me. 

Also, the last part bothered me. The part about only Mormons go to heaven and if you leave, you never see your family again. To the best of my understanding, that's entirely false. Everyone goes to heaven. There is no hell. The only thing is what level of heaven you go to. You will for sure see your family again even if you leave, because the family that stays will be able to visit you as often and as long as they want. You can travel to the lower tiers, you just can't travel to the upper tier(s) if you reside in the lower one(s). At least, according to the teachings.

Like I said, I'll continue to read more to inform my opinion better.

But I do want to thank you for the discussion. And I wish you the best as well. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The thing is though, is that I don't want to know if it's made up. In fact, I kind of just don't care if it's made up or true. If I leave, I'd rather it be because it's not right for me because of the way I live. I don't want to learn it's made up *because* my loved ones believe it. I wouldn't want to know it to be false and have my family believe it to be true at the same time. That would make things harder for me deal with. I've never been the kind of person to create friction. I wouldn't want *them* to start questioning it as well, because they're happy believing it. 

I've thought about my future constantly from both sides. How would it be if I wasn't Mormon? How would it be if I was? I can honestly see myself happy in both scenarios. But I can also see myself being unhappy in both as well. So I just take it day by day and have just decided to go with it. Let fate push and pull me where it must.

The way I see it, I'm happy with how I'm living now. I've found some weird equilibrium and for now, I'm okay with it. 

By the way, I wanted to ask you something. I was afraid to ask earlier because I was afraid you would think I was being snarky, but now that things are diffused, What's with your username? If you don't believe, then why that username? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I never once said that what was posted was anti Mormon. I also don't blindly follow this religion. I've seen a bunch of different perspectives. Heck, half my family isn't Mormon. If you were to watch me go through one day of my life you'd see that I'm not a good Mormon. I'm pretty much Mormon in name only. Yeah I don't do drugs or smoke or drink but that's just a personal thing that I've never been in to. But I do and support many things the church doesn't. You and I are not the same. You weren't in my shoes. I'm not saying your experience doesn't hold any value, but people have different lives. Things vary person to person. You said we were taught that questioning the church is a sin. I was never taught that. I was always told it was normal and it was up to us to do the research and figure out for ourselves if it was true or not. 

I'm always struggling with religion. Honestly maybe I don't care if it's true or not. Maybe I like believing there is a God. Believing in an afterlife and great plan for everyone. I stay Mormon not because I'm worried what other Mormons think, but because of my family. I mean they love and support me no matter what, even if I did leave, but there would still be disappointment. I also enjoy the community of the church. I go to the singles branch so no one there is pushy or preachy. They're all really cool and nice people that are around my age that are fun to talk to. 

I know you never said this, but I just wanted it to be clear that I'm not a hardcore devout Mormon blindly following a religion I know nothing about. I'm simply an impostor playing pretend because it's the easiest thing to do right now. Playing pretend until I can discover how I really feel on my own. I consider everything and rule nothing out. That's why I look at both sides. Yeah I may not do a lot of reading. I never said that was a good thing. I wasn't bragging about it. It's a flaw and I will have to read a lot to discover how I really feel. I realize everything I just said may seem hypocritical and might null everything I've said in previous comments, but that's the honest truth. 

I'm just a dude on the internet.

	<TEXT> Well for one I never claimed to know the absolute truth. And I never said I was more right than a Jew or Catholic. I'm just a dude on the internet who likes movies and doesn't like reading. 

I also never claimed anything specific to be anti Mormon. Like you said, I probably never read the stuff you talked about. So it didn't really make since to me why you'd bring that stuff up when I never claimed anything specifically, and especially not the stuff you brought up, to be anti Mormon or hostile. It was all kind of irrelevant. You asking me what about all those publications is hostile is a weird question when I didn't say any of them were. You simply asked me to define "anti Mormon".

	<TEXT> I guess people or things that aggressively oppose Mormons or Mormonism with hostility? I personally use it to describe things that are hostile and aggressively opposed to it. It's fine to oppose something, it's when it gets aggressive and hostile I'd start using the term "anti". Technically, you can totally be anti anything and not be aggressive which is perfectly fine. So long as no one is getting mentally, emotionally, or physically hurt. I didn't mean what was posted was anti Mormon (I didn't read it obviously) or you or anyone here specifically. I was just saying I read that stuff all the time. I mean you come across that stuff frequently on the internet often so you can't really avoid it. And I don't really try to avoid it for that matter. Like I said, I'll read anything, anti Mormon or not, as long as it's not too long. Or I find it interesting. So I guess I should correct myself, I hate reading unless it's something I truly find interesting or love, like film. I could read for hours about movies.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Never said I was temple worthy. I don't pay tithing. I'm not a good Mormon. I agree with you that it's not right to group the Mormons together as people because they're different person by person. That's been my problem with this thread. There's a bunch of people in here saying that Mormons are bad people and "love bombers" and malicious. I'm okay with people having problems with the church as a whole and certain individual Mormons, but when you start grouping them together and call me terrible because I'm Mormon that's when I get upset. I'm not like most Mormons because of my family. I have a gay cousin that I love and half my family isn't Mormon so I was raised to never judge people based on their religion but who they are as a person. 

I was downvoted earlier just because I told someone there are great people who happen to be Mormon and said that I was Mormon as well and just wanted everyone to be treated equally. Why? Who knows. I wasn't being dishonest, I was respectful and polite and non aggressive. 

My motto has always been "Live and let live. Don't worry about what other people are doing unless it directly affects you." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This will sound stupid, but religion isn't about believing with your brain, but with your heart. Religion isn't about finding out if it's factually accurate, it's about faith. And it is up to the individual to choose to have faith or not. See, I always thought the people who call Joseph Smith a con man and call Mormonism a hoax are just as bad as the religious people who push their religion on others. It's the same thing, but instead of pushing their beliefs, they're pushing their disbelief onto others. People should just live and let live. Someone believes in something you don't? Who cares. You think it makes them an idiot? Who cares. I'm sure we all have more important things to deal with than worry about what someone else believes in. I'm not talking bout you specifically, relevantlife, I'm talking people in general including me.

I find myself constantly struggling with my beliefs, but in my experience, yeah I've seen people have a bad experience with Mormons and the religion, but I've also seen people's lives change for the better as well. Just like any religion or belief or whatever. But what do I really know? I'm just a person.

We are all just people. We can't prove (a)God exists and we can't prove (a)God doesn't exist, so that means we are all just arguing about who's hypothesis is better, which is why religious debates are so dumb. </TEXT>

I believe I'm doing a good job at lighting dark scenes and having the right camera settings, but even still, I'm noticing lots of noise. Even when I use lenses that are great in low light situations. Are t3i's typically bad at low light situations and generally produce a lot of noise?

What are some good ways to prevent, battle, or fix noisy footage? And should I just invest in a better camera? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was just saying that the piano scene was just a good scene in general, not specifically the cinematography, although I do think Spring Breakers is a beautifully shot film despite the quality of the film itself, which I like. And I do agree that Prisoners was beautifully shot. You might like [this](http://mattscottvisuals.com/blog/2014/1/10/-what-are-you-looking-at-disecting-the-work-of-a-master). It's a breakdown and examination of Prisoner's cinematography. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> As it says in the title, I have a short film scheduled to shoot on Saturday and my actor bailed. The equipment is already rented and props are bought. I could really use a miracle here. I don't even care if you're an actor or not. If you believe you can act and can appear menacing, please give it a shot.

If you volunteer please know it's unpaid(I'm broke) and it *is* a main role so one other shooting day will be in the future(October 25th). After that you're done. 

The role calls for a male actor. Age unspecified as well as race. The only thing is you have to look like someone in their late 20s or early 30s. Also, I can provide footage of the day 1 shoot to show we know what we're doing and this won't be a terrible home movie.

I'm in a terrible situation here and this is my last ditch attempt to save this project that has already been started and has had the heart, soul, blood, sweat, and tears of other people poured into it. Help? </TEXT>

I have not seen these movies yet but I *do* want to see them. Because of where I live and how long two of them have been out, when Friday hits none of them will be playing here anymore. I want to catch them before they leave the theater.

I'm working and going to school this week so tomorrow/today(Tuesday) is my only free day. And because of the showtimes, I only have time to see three of them. This put me in a position to make a hard choice!

Which of the four, without spoiling things, can I eliminate and wait to see on Redbox or something? Which three are the must see ones? I realize this all depends on my personal taste, but what do you guys have to say?  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> I want to talk about Matthew McConaughey </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-08-27 00:29:41 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> What was it about Matthew McConaughey that changed? It's no secret that lately McConaughey has turned into one of Hollywood's "go to" guy as of late. He has turned his career around and went from being a joke to being one of the most talented actors working today. 

My question is, what was it that changed? Did McConaughey actually become a better actor, or did he just start choosing better movies?

I was watching Sahara, the adventure movie from 2005, and noticed that McConaughey himself hadn't really changed. It felt like the same Matthew that we are getting today. He still acted the same, yet I still felt like I was watching a not good McConaughey performance. I didn't *think* he gave a bad performance but it *felt* like a bad one, if that makes sense? 

So when did this change in McConaughey happen? And was the change with himself and how he acted in projects, or was it simply he started picking better projects? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When I was in high school some buddies and I went to shoot a video for our film class. We needed shots of planes taking off. So we thought it would be a good idea to go to our international airport and film planes taking off while we were on a dirt road that went between the runways. I was also wearing a ghillie suit. 

The next thing we knew three suv's with fully tactical cops came driving up. They made us erase all of our footage. We explained to them what we were doing. We found out they were pretty cool and joked around with us, and even told us where we could go to get permission to film planes. Then they let us go.

That situation could have gone so bad but lucky for us we were dealing with some cool cops. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Interviewing myself. I like walking around the house or neighborhood asking myself questions as if an interviewer was talking to me like I was a famous person for doing something. Usually making or staring in a movie. I play both parts and ask myself what the filmmaking process was like and what obstacles I faced while making the movie. As someone who actually *does* make movies, it often helps me work out problems I might be having with production.

But yeah, I know other people talk to themselves, but I don't think they assume roles and play all the parts. </TEXT>
