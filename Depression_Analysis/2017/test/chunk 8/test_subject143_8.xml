	<TEXT> Yeah perhaps you're right about that, I do hope things work out for you two, and don't take advice from anyone who says "End it now" no one can understand the situation better than you or your SO do, although sexting with my GF does feel a little silly when I'm not in the mood. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've had a period like this for about a month some time ago when I wasn't feeling good about my performance in the bedroom and my confidence in general when it came to sex got quite low because of it and anything to do with sex such as sexting and talking about it just brought me down because I knew I couldn't perform in the bedroom, I don't know if this might be the case with him but perhaps he's just not feeling as confident as he used to be?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You've hit the nail on the head here i guess what it is that i'm most scared of was like you said the guy being better at this than i am, i feel like i would take that the wrong way and knock my confidence, it's not an easy decision to make, losing all control and allowing this to happen.

The part you explained about stepping back has really gave me a new perspective on how to look at it, thinking of it that way i don't get as angry as i would normally, i guess i picture myself in the point of view of the other guy and that's not the best thing to do.

I do need to work on my own insecurities and overthinking the situation and i think i can do it, you've helped me out more than you realise but i know i'm not going to change over night, but at least i have a new perspective to think about, thank you. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Admittedly i have had a bad day today so perhaps it seems a bit exagerated, but i don't think your comment is fair, just because i feel this way now does not mean i can't change my outlook by working on it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you for your reply, I'll talk to her about this later on, but i feel like she'll just think i'm simply asking for this for my own pleasure rather than to help with the jealousy, I will try to explain it to her as best i can and hopefully she will understand.

But what if even after my experience i still feel too jealous, i would feel absolutely horrible denying her the experience that i had, and i'm sure she would be upset if i did that after her allowing me to have a threesome with two girls. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So my SO is interested in group sex and i'm not entirely against it myself, but even just the thought of another guy touching my SO makes me angry, like shaking with rage angry, and even if she jokingly says something about another guy to purposely annoy me it REALLY pisses me off.

So i guess what i'm asking is how can I get over the jealousy so we can try new things, i know i'm not ready now but how can i make that first step? </TEXT>
