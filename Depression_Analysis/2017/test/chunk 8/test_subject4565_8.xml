	<TEXT> 98% is a terrible rating. Next time, try for 99.5 or above. 4 negs in the last month is also bad.

Has he marked the item as shipped? I would wait a few days after that point and then if nothing has shown, i would open a case saying item not received. If the item has not been marked as shipped, I would contact him and ask when the item is shipping out. If you open a case in a timely manner if the item never shows, you will most likely end up with your money back since the buyer has no proof (tracking) that he ever shipped your package. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> the chances of that being the case are stupendously small in comparison with more mundane explanations such as military aircraft, balloons, etc.

The way in which these and other similarly reported objects move, rule out conventional aircraft / balloons / etc. because of the physics and intelligent control involved with their flight characteristics. Combine that with the objects shape, lack of sound, lack of FAA beacons, altitude, and the general frequency of sightings **across the globe**, and you have a phenomenon that is clearly far from ordinary.

While not particularly in this case, similar objects are said to have been reported to exhibit flight characteristics that are impossible (undiscovered) at our current understanding of physics, let alone our current level of technology. E.G. - acceleration from zero to 1000+ MPH instantaneously, 1000+ MPH to zero instantaneously, executing right angle turns at constant mach speed, performing aerial maneuvers that would kill a human pilot due to G forces, doing all of this using an unconventional propulsion system that is inaudible, and that is only scratching the surface of their stated abilities.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> And completely silent as well, correct? 

In my own personal opinion, they are not of this world, but thoughts like that will get you castrated around here, m8. 

Most people can't wrap their head around that possibility. They either don't *want* to believe or their mind will not let them think outside the box. Then again, perhaps they have just not done the proper research in regards to the thousands of yearly reported sightings and experiences had by people worldwide. Unfortunately, this topic is often suppressed in the mainstream media where most of the populace get their information, so it does take a little digging to find what you are looking for. 

After all the recreational research I have done, books I have read on the subject, and the countless stories/sighting reports I have read (from overwhelmingly credible witnesses), to me, at this point, it is the **only** possibility. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What you have is a typical UFO sighting. You won't get any answers here because nobody knows what they are exactly. This is a very common type of sighting in that 3-5+ orbs form triangles and other shapes in the sky and appear to be under intelligent control. The specific movements of the orbs many times eliminate flares as being a possible explanation. They are also almost always located within our own atmosphere, ruling out stars or planets. 

How did you end up losing sight of them? Did them blink out or slowly drift out of your vision range? I have come across hundreds or similar sighting reports in the past several years, none of which have ever been adequately explained. 

Excellent quality on a couple of the photos, btw.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I highly recommend you take the advice of the top couple comments in this thread. Also, it is important to document the abuse, as in be sure to take pictures of the damage your father causes you and your siblings, so you can prove that he is a dangerous person. 

Obviously, be careful with these photographs (whether digital or physical) so that your father doesn't find them before you are able to seek help. 

Best of luck to you, I hope you have the ability to follow through with these steps and take appropriate action. 

Stay strong. </TEXT>
