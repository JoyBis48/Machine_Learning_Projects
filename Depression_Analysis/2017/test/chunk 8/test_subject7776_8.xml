	<TEXT> Yeah, the dealership added the stripes, they also did the tinting of all the cars. I was saying that the Rocker stripes are really just dumb IMO, because while yes, it is 50 years from when Mustangs were made, its just the Base GT with the dealer stripes added. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm sure he figured, Young guy, Brand new fast car, and doesn't want to get chewed out in the Corps for speeding. Since, in the first place he shouldn't have been driving, he got talked to about that before he came back.
Yup, it was literally one exit before PAVS.
I'm not saying he doesn't deserve one, obviously 40+MPH over could seriously hurt someone, and with what we were doing, I'm slightly surprised we didn't actually hit anything. They gave his GF a ticket, which she's obviously upset about, but she was basically doing what we did, on a lesser extent.
If a cop saw us going up to flagstaff on Friday night, woooo, that'd be a funny thing. </TEXT>

And the stripes are sick, until you realize that its not a 50th, and the side stripes are just annoying when you notice that. [This is the one my friend had bought](http://www.bergeford.com/new/Ford/2015-Ford-Mustang-mesa-az-eb8b4eff0a0a0064487c13719b4589bf.htm) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah my friend bought his at Berge, he got 2k off a GT, and that was the most wiggle room they could give him, so they said. So he paid 35k instead of 37, but after taxes and stuff it was low 40 according to his girlfriend. They were really nice and kind about everything. They let us have a test drive (which they're strict about, since who wants a "new" car with 100 miles on it already?). They cracked jokes with us and let him take all the time he wanted with buying. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I love the 15's, Headroom up front is awesome, being 6'0, sitting in the back is kind of a bitch to put it lightly. The new Mustangs definitely turn more heads than any other car in its class. Personally, I haven't driven it yet so I don't know how it handles, but my friend said it handles amazingly.
And seeing him do a slide in a cul-de-sac, I believe him.
Berge Ford in Mesa had a few GT's, if you actually wanted to drive one. They also have a 50 Years Limited Edition, but its a 50k car. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> He got it on the 29th, had it for 6 hours, we went to go to an Instagram meet-up held in Scottsdale. The cop said he saw us going fast but wasn't going to do anything, and then he started going faster, and faster, we hit 95, and then the cop got next to him, no lights on and waited until there was room to pull him over, then he talked him.
From what I was told by my friend and his passenger, is that he told him he was following us for quite some time, and then asked my friend what he does for a living, to which my friend told him hes in the Marine Corps, and the cop said "You don't want to die do you?" and "Do you like your car?", he told him to slow down and to tell me to slow down.
Probably passed at least 5 cars pulled over on the way back.
And his girlfriend got pulled over by the same cop a little bit down the road for 84 in a 55, but wrote her for 74 in a 55.

He was a pretty cool cop, I'm glad he didn't pull me over, or I'd be out a car.

And thus concludes story time. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My friend had planned to surprise everyone with him coming home Thanksgiving morning from his Marine MOS school. I went to pick him up at 3am and we surprised everyone. We had planned a trip to Flagstaff for that Friday and before we went up, he wanted to see a few Mustangs, as he told me he wanted to buy a new car. There was this one, or an 04 Cobra with 78k Miles. He drove the GT and we left saying "We will be back tomorrow." After we left, its all we could talk about that night and into the next morning. We came back from Flagstaff and even before he went to our homes, we went to the dealership. His mind was made, and he bought it that day. He already had gotten pulled over once in it for 95 in a 55 (construction zone). (Thankfully they went after him and not me!) I'm the only one he will let look after it and make sure its clean, so I get to buff and wax it tomorrow, since there already is a scratch.
All in all, it's an incredible car, and I've changed my mind about it. I'd want one. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's a 2004 DSG Mustang GT, 40th anniversary, Premium, has 24.5k miles, no real problems besides just some cosmetic things, like oxidation in the third brake light and on the driver side headlight, has a scratch behind the tire and a small dent, and has a scuff on the passenger side front bumper that I plan of buffing out this weekend.

Overall I'm in love with it, its my favorite body style, has all the little doodads I wanted, (keyless entry and power windows are a god send).

I can't wait to start making changes to it.

	<TEXT> Thats what I'm thinking, but my friend is currently doing Marine training, so hes not here, we're just trying to fix it up for him when he gets back, but I do know its got BBK CAI, Cobra Intake Manifold, Short Throw Shifter, Pretty sure no Muffler that I could see.

Believe me, I'm trying to find the Modlist that he has, Earliest I can know is Tuesday when he leaves MCT to go for MOS school, I can keep you posted! </TEXT>

The car hasn't had tags for 2 years so we're working on getting that all sorted out, but once thats done.. Gonna fucking rev the shit out of it. </TEXT>
