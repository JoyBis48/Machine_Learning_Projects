	<TEXT> That's surprising. Aren't gag orders issued by a judge in a court case so as not to taint the jury? The gov can't just order gag orders willy-nilly,  can it?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I see it as a tactical move to get the results he - and his constituents- want, not a dishonest one. It's pretty clear what issues he stands for and he much more consistent than most politicians. It's what I like about Sanders too. Clinton on the other hand is a typical "go with the wind" politician who will say one thing today and do another thing tomorrow  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> - Japanese kanji will help with reading/writing but nothing else. 
- Mandarin, definitely. 
- Individual tutor (with a native speaker) definitely more effective if you can afford it, but I would combine that with *small* group classes for added variety. 
- set yourself vocabulary goals and stick to them. 
- Don't spend too much time learning to *write* characters; you won't often need to write by hand (computers and phones use pinyin), and it's time-consuming (though perhaps easier for you if you're good at kanji). Reading is much more important.  
- Chinese is interesting historically, culturally and politically, and well worth learning.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> True but at least it's a step in the right direction as insurance is much cheaper than paying out of pocket when you have a serious illness or accident. Making care affordable would require the type of government intervention that is anathema to most Americans.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The problem is also lack of competition. If the cost of producing X widget is too high another business will see the opportunity and enter the market at a lower price to capture market share. With health care, the barrier to entry is so high that's not really an option. And smaller markets can't support multiple competitors, especially for specialized care. (GPs can be more competitive and this is why they don't make as much money and no one wants to be one) 
This is why free market models don't work for health care and it should be regulated to avoid price gouging just like the state does with basic utilities. I favor free markets but this is one case where Europe and Japan definitely have it right.  </TEXT>
