	<TEXT> I've driven in many different countries as well as states, and by far the worst drivers (mainly taxi) are here in NY.  My theory is that the majority of this city goes by public transportation, and having access to a car is much harder.  Therefore, not experienced.  

I've also heard native NY'ers claim they wanted a service/driving job in the city (police, etc) b.c they wanted to drive a car.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There's also this other guy, he's called Jim Harbaugh, aka as the Head Coach.  But of course, he's never to blame right?  He only sits in every meeting for game planning, has the final call as to what the play calling should be etc.  Yeah Roman and Kaep are the biggest reasons.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Posted this in a similar thread:  
If you look at the past 3 seasons, it's been a different team in stark contrasts.
 Year 1, Harbaugh and Roman simplify the playbook and cater to Alex strengths. Remember the genius naked QB bootleg against the Saints in the playoffs? Where has that gone? The offense that year was pretty dismal at times, but we played really disciplined. There were a lot of shits, 2 TE sets, etc. Low scoring affairs, but the D was monster that year.

Year 2, we unleash Colin and the read option. Now the O is passing down the field more often, letting Colin run wild. In all the midst of it, the play calling changed and started to see more delay of games, weird run calls, etc. Let's not forget the last play of the Super Bowl.

Year 3. In the off season, both Harbs and Roman both agreed to clean and simplify the calls and terminology. What happened to our 2TE sets, or jumbo package for ground and pound?  How come Kap still throws 90+ mph fastballs to his receivers only a few feet away?  All these what and why ?s </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I still remember vividly the night of 9/11.  Friends and I were smoking a blunt outside looking up a the sky.  All of a sudden we saw  2 F-14 fighter jets hovering over the SF bay.  

You could barely see their outline, but could tell by the sound and the lights surrounding the plane.  It was unreal thinking no other planes were allowed in the sky other than them.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My own take on this, and from what I observed living in not so great areas, i.e West Oakland and Riverside County.  When it gets hot, people like to drink more, that's a given.  

I noticed the liquor stores got busier, and the prices of 40 oz's dropped a little.  It's a cycle that doesn't stop.  People get drunk, sometimes get more irritable bc of the heat, drink more because their irritable, etc.  

Then you mix that with violence, and with school being out kids being bored, and it's a perfect recipe for crime.  I have no stats on this, just personal observation, but it's a theme that occurs every summer.  And chances are, the hotter it gets, more violence.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> where on this post was it noted that I didn't credit the F.O?  With all these moves being made, and the F.O trying to win a championship, if these moves end up being disastrous, who gets the blame?  That was the message of this post 

You can claim we had the best starting line up, which is arguable.  I don't think we do, nor do we have a championship roster at this moment.  

As for "Cry Monta" Is that supposed to mean something?   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> With GS being in the news spotlight and all, we are now under more scrutiny than ever before.  One thing I'm curious about is the "blame game"  that might happen if we don't win, or exceed expectations.  

For instance, we had a bad bench and blame can be put on Myers and company for providing Mjax with such a shitty 2nd group.  I will give Myers some credit for the trade of Steve Blake.  However, we went into the season with Toney Douglas as the back up PG.  Did he really think that was going to work?  

So the question is, at what point is it more a personnel issue (meaning players and how they're utilized) and a coach issue?  I'm expecting us to make major roster moves this summer, and if the trade doesn't work in our favor, who gets the blame?  I guess my point is, how many freebies does Myers and West get?  Is Lacob so blinded and so awe struck by his F.O that he won't hold them accountable?   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This F.O's message is to win now, not later.  I'm fine with that, and that message has been consistent throughout it all.  I want to see the same high standard held to the players, I.E Klay accountable for his poor shot selection, Steph with multiple turn overs, Lee and his lack of defense.  

I guess what I'm saying is that if the F.O is this serious, expect some major moves this summer to push the chips all in.   </TEXT>
