	<TITLE> A creepy old man in a black cloak, in a cold room, in a nightmare, in an old house... </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-07-15 16:10:57 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> When I was a kid my family and I moved to the countryside. For the first four years we lived in a small town which was fine but we eventually moved, quite litterally to the middle of nowhere. It was this one street town with like 4 houses. It was ok because I spent most of my time indoors anyway (I've always been indoors-ey).
The house we were living in was big, much bigger than anything I had ever stayed in before (before we moved to the countryside we lived in a suburban area of a city with a pretty big home, then a small town, then the middle of nowhere). Most of the bedrooms were upstairs but there was one down stairs. Everytime you went in it it was cold, when I say cold I mean it felt like ice, you could always see your breath. So, as a rule, I stayed out of there. The rest of the house was awesome and my brothers and sisters and I had a pretty cool time living there but I started getting horrible feelings whenever I went near the cold room:
My eyes would water like I was going to cry, I would get a sore chest. I always tried to keep myself calm by explaining to myself that it was just me, I got a sore chest because of my asthma, I had watery eyes because of some other reason I'm sure I found less than convincing.
The part that gets creepy was when our kitchen was being remodeled. Because of the layout of the kitchen we had to move the fridge into the cold bedroom untill the remodelling was finished. I couldn't stand going in there and eventually I straight out refused. You see I spend a lot of time with my two dogs (who were younger at the time) since I'm almost always inside and whenever they went near that room they would show their teeth and raise their hackles, which they virtually never do.
One night I fell asleep and had this nightmare. In it I went into the room to get something as fast as I possibly could but then the door slammed shut and I couldn't open it for the life of me. On the other side my brother was trying to force it open. Then this man appeared he was clothed in a huge black cloak and started mumbling words I couldn't make out before he started choking me. I woke up coughing like mad and had, what I call, a "mini" asthma attack. I told my mum the next morning and she starred as if looking through me not at me. Then she said:
'XboxG4mer I had the exact same dream'
She never wanted to freak me out so straight away she comforted me by telling me it was just a dream. I kept having the same nightmare and I never asked her but I think my mum did too because after a couple of months we moved away.
The man in the dream was old but looked wholly evil. I don't know what happened in that house but there was something about that room. Nothing could warm it and the eery sensations I got when near it were stronger than any I've ever felt. </TEXT>

***EDIT 1:*** So a few of you said I should look into it and see what I can find. When I did a quick google of the street it turned up nothing and gave me the names of nearby locations. I'll update again soon.

***EDIT 2*** So I found it on the googs (sounds weird, google sounds better). However it only spoke about how the "village" once had a larger population, a school and a train station etc but after the coal mining industry in the area was done many people moved and full streets lay empty. I knew all of this and when I say full streets I mean like 15 houses maybe 20, barely anyone lives there today. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> After you eat anything wash the bowl/plate etc. It stops dishes from piling up.

Empty the trash frequently and taking shoes off at the front door is a good rule if you have carpets. 

Set aside a couple of hours one day a week and wash your windows and doors etc.

I realise they were more about keeping it clean. As for organisation:

Keep things in certain places. You keep your clothes in your wardrobe and dishes in the cupboard so do the same thing and set certain locations for certain things. 

A good I dea is a coat rack. Some can be bought that are pretty nice and they stop jackets from piling up.

	<TEXT> What you have to first understand is that the government cannot just print money as it needs to have a value. Here in Scotland our money is worth sterling. So if we wanted we could go to a bank and request sterling (but no one does). Instead of everyone carrying said sterling we carry notes to represent them. 


So the government, here can print depending on the amount of sterling we have. If they print beyond what we have inflation occurs and prices rise. This was a major issue in Weimar Germany 1923 and again in 1929. 

So to answer your question: Governments can and should print within what they have, depending on what the currency represents.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The breeze (Brianna) from the "GONE" [series](http://www.michaelgrantbooks.co.uk/gone/) by Michael Grant.


She and I were around the same age when I read it (14) and she was everything I liked in a girl. Long(ish) Brown hair, witty, smart, a little bit cocky. She was just an awesome, well written character and then...

***SPOILER ALERT***


































They killed her off in the most inhumane way possible! I still cry at night. (Joking) but seriously she was awesome.

	<TEXT> I know I'm late but hopefully you will read this. First of all I'm sorry you guys can't have children. I think you should tell your mum to stop torturing you and your wife. I know it's not an easy thing to do, trust me it's not, but maybe you should give her an ultimatum. Tell her it's not Claires fault she can't have children and if she doesn't give you both a sincere apology and stop upsetting you both then you want nothing to do with her. I know that sounds like a terrible thing to say to her but she will most definitely choose you and I know it will cause friction and tension but another option is that you sit down with her and Claire and explain that adoption is in no way evil and tell her she needs to stop, this is no one's fault. </TEXT>

I am not a a pessimist for they look at the world with negative views and thoughts. Nor am I an optimist for they look at the world and often try and see the good where there is none. I am a realist. I am happy when things are good and face the hard times when they arrive.
