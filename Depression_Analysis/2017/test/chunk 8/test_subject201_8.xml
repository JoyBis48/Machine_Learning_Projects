	<TEXT> Lets say a religious person is in a situation where they are close to death but still have a chance. Why does the will to live usually win the battle when the other option is heaven or what pertains to that individual. To me this means that within even the most hardcore religious person there is a fraction of doubt. How would you translate this contradiction? What are other peoples thoughts on this. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is my hand made variable wattage OKR wooden box mod I made myself. It includes a master on/off switch, fire button, potentiometer, blue LED, and a 5/10 thread to mount any RDA. The internal components include a battery sled, 2 Sony VTC5s all copper wiring, zenor diode, an OKR 1/10 variable wattage chip, a few capacitors, and 4 rare earth magnets to hold on the lid. The wood is hand cut and worked using mahogany and I used guerrilla wood glue to attach the corners. From there I sanded it and stained it.Then did some wood burning  As you can see its a bit haggard from lots of use. It isn't perfect but its something I made and have pride in and something no one else has. This is the first one I've built so the next one I build should be an improvement. Anyways I thought Id share. Open to any questions or critiques.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It doesn't take a scientist to figure that one out. So far your very credible. This is called sarcasm. However, I will answer this... JUST BECAUSE your not being rude *as much*. No I do not think this theory is 100% fucking correct. However plausible because we can not see inside a black hole. Maybe someday we will create something that can pass near the event horizon on a rotating weak black hole and I will be proved wrong (probably not). Until that that day shut the fuck up and stop trying to prove yourself on a fucking Reddit comment section. </TEXT>
