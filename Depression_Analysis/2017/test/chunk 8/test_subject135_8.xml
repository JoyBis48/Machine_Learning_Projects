	<TEXT> It's much more likely that you're smelling something they ate that tends to hang around and gets exuded (like onions, garlic, fish and curry) than you are smelling their vagina. Or they simply don't bathe often enough, so you're smelling stale sweat. 

And this is not limited to women. Men smell bad too all the time for the same reasons. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  You're supposed to assume it's a movie adaptation of that same book :P I think I will have to edit that and make it more clear.

I figured that's what you meant, but the answer is the same: depends on the book; depends on the movie. Maybe some book or movie fanatics will say that one is always better than the other but I think that's silly. Sometimes the book might be better, sometimes the movie might be better, and perhaps shockingly, they might even both be equally good. So how can I have a preference without knowing specifically what book or movie we're referring to? </TEXT>

That is not why they don't work. They don't work because they refuse to go to the army and if you don't go to the army you're not *allowed* to work. 

(This is a very simplified reason but the point is that it is nothing to do with thinking that work is "beneath" them.) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's not about the "inconvenience," it's about the principle that United is engaging in deceptive advertising and they need to stop. Just complaining and demanding a refund is unlikely to stop them. A lawsuit (regardless of whether the plaintiffs win or lose) is embarrassingly bad publicity and brings the information to people's attention when they might not have known about it otherwise and might have been taken in. 

Also, what you missed is that it's not one person suing, it's a class action lawsuit. That means that any money won gets divided up among as many people as sign on. If 10,000 people are named as plaintiffs and they win $5 million it means that each person would get significantly less than $500 after taking off lawyers' fees. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Exactly. A good play will read well and a bad play will sometimes be improved by watching it being performed (but not always). I recently saw and read The Weir by Conor McPherson and it was tedious to read and watch. 

As for OP's point, Shakespeare is obviously more difficult for most people than modern plays so naturally it won't be as enjoyable to read. 

But OP might like Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead by Tom Stoppard. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You can't make such a broad statement based on reviews of one book. You want to talk Japanese literature, Haruki Murakami is America's darling. 

You'll also have to be more specific about what the reviews were complaining about. Could be that it was poorly translated. People said the same thing about Battle Royale so when they reissued it recently, they re-translated it first -- and it still had language problems. They must have cheaped out on paying a translator and editor. </TEXT>

Conservative rabbis have extended the concept of adultery to include a husband cheating on his wife with an unmarried woman (which does not fall under the traditional definition), and are willing to command a husband to offer a divorce to his wife if she wants one, and to dissolve the marriage unilaterally if he refuses (which would not be permitted under traditional Jewish law  only a man can initiate a divorce).

	<TEXT> I think you've taken the quote out of context and it doesn't say what you think it's saying. In fact, he's saying the opposite. He's saying that if people properly appreciated how good (and sometimes bad) the classics are, they wouldn't be so opposed to novelty and individualism in art. Instead, they've elevated the classics to a sacrosanct canon and artists' new works are "canon"-fodder.

	<TEXT> I read a book once by a survivor who talked about how the Jews in Auschwitz hated Christians because the Nazi's were "Christians" and attended church every Sunday.

Either you are misremembering what the book said or the book has no idea what it's talking about. Take your pick.

The Nazi persecuted the Jews based on race, not religion. The church played little to no part in the active persecution of Jews.

The Catholic Church mostly stood by in silence during the Holocaust while the Protestant denominations were somewhat opposed to the Nazis -- out of self-interest. They were against Nazi control of churches; they didn't care about the Jews.

It was founded because Judaism was in the hands of the elite and this was a way of bringing it to the poor and uneducated. It was innovative and almost rebellious. I'm not sure how it got to the state that it's in today, but conceptually Chassidut has a lot to offer, which is why you find a lot of people who become religious are drawn to the less strict and more spiritual groups like Lubavitch, Breslov and Boston. </TEXT>

Most marriages are indeed not happy ones. They are "happy-enough" ones. And the ones that are miserable usually end in divorce. Some guy did a huge marriage survey and did an AMA on it a little while back. He said that the only happy marriages were between two completely psychologically healthy people. And since most of us aren't completely psychologically healthy, neither are our relationships. </TEXT>

Yes, for old or sick people, e-reading can be helpful, but most people are not old or sick. 

Among young/healthy people you're just as likely to find people who say that reading on a tablet or phone is difficult for them because they keep getting distracted as much as you'll find people who say that they've suddenly started reading more because of them.

And if you want to say that easily distracted people should get dedicated e-readers, we get right back to my original point, that now having a tablet and phone and e-reader generates a lot more waste than books.  </TEXT>
