	<TEXT> As a former muslim, I can confidently say that Islam is exactly like that.  There is a very popular hadith that pretty much itemizes how one gets into heaven.  

First, you have to physically and outwardly be religious.
If you can't accomplish that, you must at least be inwardly religious and god fearing.
If you can't do that or are another religion, there's still hope!!  All you have to do is believe in the one-ness of god, regardless of what name you call him by.
If you can't accomplish this, perhaps missionaries were unable to reach you with the holy message in time, then you can still get into heaven.  All you have to do is have an ounce of goodness in you. (pretty vague, right?)

So, not so unique, eh? </TEXT>

He clearly has better dicsipline than Rumble or Hendricks, so being out of shape between fights would never be an issue for him. </TEXT>
