	<TEXT> Scenario 1: Should be no problem for the Klingons tbh. I'm sure their personal deflector shields would easily withstand anything the Predator can throw at them. His camoflauge would be the hardest thing to deal with, but it'd basically be a matter of time.

Scenario 2: Tougher call. I'd say Klingons actual combat abilities are overrated and most of their advantages over humans come from more durability. They have redundant organs and a tough skeletal system, and I believe (could be wrong, I know Vulcans do) a stronger immunity to poisons. This would make it hard for the Predator to actually land a fatal blow.

On the other hand, Klingons are used to fighting unarmoured opponents (since their main combat is with Starfleet/Romulans, who don't wear armour due to it generally being pointless) so I'm unsure how a  Bat'leth would deal with Predator armour. I'm unfamiliar with Predator's combat skills or physiology. Maybe a strong Klingon like Worf wins, but a weaker Klingon would lose. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Batman, Peter Parker, Reed Richards and Tony Stark all appear on Shark Tank. Who can get the best deal? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-07-06 07:37:10 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> It's the current US Shark Tank. Each character goes on assuming a secret identity - that of a young entrepreneur in their early 20s. This eliminates the default perception of the character (ie. investors feeling safer investing with Wayne, a billionaire, as opposed to a mere Uni student). However, they keep their current personalities. **Important note: Any item pitched is free from existing patents, etc., so basically ignore issue of ownership for existing items**

**Round 1)** Each pitches one of their signature items. Specifically:

*  Wayne pitches his utility belt, complete with non-Bat themed grappling hook, boomerrangs and smoke grenades.
* Peter pitches his web shooters.
* Tony Stark pitches a jetpack that can be controlled with body movements
* Reed pitches three uniforms: one flame resistant, one allowing camouflage and one that can be stretched without damaging it (imagine the wash cycles this baby could withstand). He can get a deal on all or one costume.

**Round 2)** Each makes a new invention designed to resolve a common household problem. It can be any problem, but must be applicable to a typical home. They have 24 hours to choose a problem and create the solution. Each has $500,000,000 at their disposal for some overnight R D. And what problem do you think each is likely to address?

**Round 3)** Any invention they have ever made - they MUST have made it personally (eg. Batman didn't make a lot of his gadgets). Pick the one you think would have the most success from each character and pit them against eachother.

Remember to take into account marketability, affordability (even the Shark Tank guys aren't likely to pitch in for a Batmobile) and the individual personalities of the Shark Tank hosts. I haven't seen much US Shark Tank, but I know in the Australian version you can get an idea of which host is likely to go for which products.

If this thread has moderate success, I'll do another for super villains tomorrow. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> MC Hammer's hit "U Can't Touch This" isn't canon, but is simply MC Hammer's dream while in a coma. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-07-05 15:37:05 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> In 1990 MC Hammer released his magnum opus "Please Hammer, Don't Hurt 'Em" to critical and popular acclaim. The album featured his number one hit, U Can't Touch This, which for years people have believed to be a statement of fact.

However, upon listening to the album for the tenth time and going over some MC Hammer interviews and videos, I think I have developed a fan theory that puts this song into question.

**Exhibit A:** The lyrics of "U Can't Touch This" are pretty clear. Hammer claims that he is untouchable. And yet, we can see in numerous photos that he can, in fact, be touched. Here is a [rare photo](http://www.gettyimages.ae/detail/news-photo/adam-yauch-of-beastie-boys-chris-rock-coco-doug-e-fresh-and-news-photo/109566302) of MC Hammer being touched by one Christopher Rock. This shows that it is in fact possible to touch MC Hammer.

So the song is false? A lie? Well, maybe not. 

**Exhibit B:** Let's take a look at the albums first three tracks:

1. "Here Comes the Hammer"  	MC Hammer	4:32

2.	"U Can't Touch This"  	James   Miller	4:17

3.	"Have You Seen Her" (The Chi-Lites cover)

What's that? Track number one? "Here Comes the Hammer"? On an album called "Please Hammer, Don't Hurt 'Em"? Here are some of the lyrics: "When you came to walk on the stage after me / And if you do your catastrophe happenin's / Just like that out like a mall white to black"

The song goes on in this fashion, describing one musician bringing a hammer down on another. One might first assume that it is MC Hammer's hammer. But can we be sure? Perhaps it is a rival musician, striking MC Hammer himself with said hammer, causing him to be knocked out "white to black"!

**Exhibit C:** So then the song goes into MC Hammer's dreamscape, where he can't be touched, mirroring his inability to dodge the blow that befell him at the start of the album. The next song? A cover! Why? Because upon MC Hammer's recovery from the coma, he is too delirious to write his own song!

The evidence stands before you people, but feel free to make up your own minds.  I also strongly suggest you go and grab this album of your shelves and give it another listen, it's truly a top 10 of all time. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Note that I don't do a set amount, I just go until failure.

With sets, I started doing 15 at a time, then progressed to 20 at a time. Usually do 3 full sets and then fail on the fourth.

Doing no sets, I usually do around 30-40, fail, then try again, usually hitting 3-4 more before failing and stop.

Sets I do more all up, but I'm breaking them up. Doing them in one run I do less.

Which is better? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've been playing Dota2 for about 6 months now and I think I've been getting quite good. I'm currently sitting on about 2.5k MMR, but I think my potential is probably around the 7-8k mark. I hope to play in next years International. BUT I've hit a bit of a roadblock.

I've found recently, that when things aren't going while, I can't seem to convince my teammates to do what I say and win the game. No matter what racial slurs I use or no matter how many family members I threaten to fuck they just. won't. listen. I need advice, because I feel like my career in Dota2 has some great potential, but I just can't get past this roadblock.

Thanks! </TEXT>

 So a regular human child would be capable of performing that level of agility and accuracy, while blindfolded, as Ciri did at the start of The Witcher 3, if they just got some training?

If that qualifies as "not bad", then are humans from the Witcher universe just better than real humans? Kind of like how Batman 'doesn't have superpowers'? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> they are basically bacteria encrusted food stuck in your tonsils, ever coughed up some foul small whitish semi hard waxy bit that smelled so foul you imagined satan has consummated with your throat?

No.

I'll get my gums checked on my next appointment, but they've never commented on any issues with my gums and I get a yearly checkup. I will make sure to specifically mention the smell when I floss next time I go. </TEXT>

In 2008, 6.0% of divorces involved separation within the first year of marriage, 32.7% within the first 5 years and a further 21.7% were separated within 5 to 9 years of marriage. Of divorcing couples in 2008, 16.8% were married less than 5 years, 24.6% between 5 and 9 years and 58.6% were married for 10 years or more.

	<TITLE> [Nolanverse Batman] Batman is actually a woman </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-06-28 11:21:12 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Just got watching the Nolan trilogy and it was pretty damn good. But one thing that stood out was how he kept the identity of Batman a secret throughout the entire franchise. A bit of a blow to comic book 'purists' who wanted it to be Wayne, but a very interesting approach nonetheless.

What intrigued me most though where the hints that either Wayne or Harvey Dent are Batman (Rachel hinting at Dent being Wayne, or Alfred making allusions to Wayne being Batman). I believe this was a red herring. Obviously, Dent cannot be Batman as the twist showed Batman killing Dent at the end of the second film.

However, this still leaves Wayne as a potential candidate. But, of course, why would Nolan go to such lengths to conceal Batman's identity if it's just going to be the same character from the comic books? I believe Batman isn't Wayne or any other likely candidate, but is in fact a woman.

The costume goes to great effort to be much bulkier than other Batman costumes - to hide breats, hips, etc. Additionally, Catwoman is the only other person in the Nolanverse to be as skilled as Batman - a hint that in THIS universe, it is actually women who are the stronger gender.

Finally, calling yourself BatMAN is a dead give away. I believe whoever Batman is is smart enough to not eliminate 50% of the population from being potential suspects, so he (or SHE) named herself BatMAN to throw people off her scent.

Thoughts? </TEXT>

I still love Zelda, but I love it because it's fun to play. I don't need to show others I like something. I don't agree with looking down on people for doing that though.

At any rate, I'm not going to let a minor pastime get in the way of making money and 10/10 titties.

Basically, while not always true, there is a general stereotype associated with people who like video game paraphernalia. You're basically labelling yourself in the eyes of others as someone who fits this stereotype. No one wants that's stereotype working for them or dating them. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The point being, you can come to Reddit and access /r/mechanicalkeyboards and /r/dota2 and /r/witcher and /r/dragonsfuckingcars all in one place.

Now say /r/mechanicalkeyboards community hates a change Reddit admin makes. Now the community becomes fragmented. Some people leave, some people stay, the people that leave form different communities. But the other three subreddits stay. You're still visiting Reddit for those.

It's very hard for any one change on Reddit to encourage a significant enough group of people to cause them to care. I loved /r/fatpeoplehate, but I'm not about to up and leave for ten different websites so I can continue accessing communities I like when they're all still here on Reddit. Most people are like this.

Edit: For clarity, yes, it might happen overtime. The key words from my post and the guy I replied to are:

for it fall like Digg did

My point is: Reddit's death will be a slow grind, not a quick fall - if it dies anytime soon at all. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've only played a handful of games, so I'll happily concede if I'm wrong, but at the moment is seems like stuffing your deck with high value cards is the easiest way to win.

There are no 'resources', no progression from being able to play weak cards to high cards or anything else preventing you from just putting all your best cards into one deck.

The depth pretty much seems limited to determining whether to bait your opponent into playing more cards or not on a specific row and how to divide your cards up. It's just a side-game, so not a big deal, but I love card games so this seems a bit disappointing at the moment. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This makes assumptions about the types of people who will hit on her.

For example, perhaps having a large penis makes you more confident in flirting with more attractive women (and vice versa).

Men with larger dongs may actually just flirt more in general.

So while the average penis is 5-6 inches, to average penis girls have put inside them might be much larger. </TEXT>
