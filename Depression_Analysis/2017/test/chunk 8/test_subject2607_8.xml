	<TEXT> I disagree with it. I'll sometimes make jokes about freshmen, but they're not serious. Honestly I try to help them out as much as I can, and be friends with them as much as I can, and make them feel accepted. It's hard being a freshman and I try to put myself in their shoes again. The most annoying thing is new sophomores making fun of freshmen. </TEXT>

We just spent $2 million  that we don't have on a new football stadium for a team that won two games in three years. Our tests scores are in the 40th percentile in the state. Pretty below average. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This might be a stretch, but there's this classic rock song that I know the rhythm of the chorus to, but I can't remember the lyrics or the name. It's really heavy rock and the chorus sounds really loud. It's one of those songs that everyone knows and has heard, like when I heard it at a dance the other day everyone was singing along. I had thought the lyrics were "You.. give me aaaaall I need" but it doesn't look like those are it. Sorry this is so vague, but it's been bothering me to no end. Thanks if anyone has any ideas. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> One thing I notice is that a lot of places and people on the internet really glorify mental illness and depression and self harm. Tumblr especially doesn't shut up about how your scars are beautiful and that mental illness is just this thing for misunderstood moody teenagers. Obviously we shouldn't be criticizing people who have mental illness or have self harmed, but we make it seem like this thing that makes you unique or different or misunderstood when in reality it's awful and doesn't make you feel special. I think that might contribute to it in teenagers especially. It's glorified. </TEXT>

And we adopted the team name and logo from our school, since we wanted to be integrated within the school. So the captain head is the main logo on our shirts and we incorporated it into our rebound rumble robot, also getting us the imagery award.  </TEXT>
