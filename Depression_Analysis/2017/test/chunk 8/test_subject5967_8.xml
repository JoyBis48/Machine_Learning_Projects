They got a chuckle out of it and I thought some of you might too.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Just landed in SF. Going to the game tomorrow, but where is the best place to watch tonight? I've watched at Underdogs before, but it's going to be packed for taco Tuesday, so I doubt I'll get a table.


Edit: I'm desperate for a place in or near the Sunset to watch the game. My sister doesn't get CSN.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Haha yesterday was my first time at a sports book and I was confused by both of those things. You give them the rotation number and they give you cash when you cash out. The woman took my tickets, went to the back where I assume there's some kind of machine that separates the winners from the losers and tells her how much to pay me. She came back and gave me the cash. 


I was and still am confused when betting spreads. Last night I picked 1234, or whatever the rotation number of the Pelicans, to cover. I just said, "1234 to cover." Is that correct or should I have said something else?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If there's runners on first and second or if the bases are loaded and there is a pop up on the infield, the umpire will call the infield fly rule. This means the batter is out whether the ball is caught or not. It's to prevent the defense from intentionally dropping the ball in order to get a double or triple play. </TEXT>
