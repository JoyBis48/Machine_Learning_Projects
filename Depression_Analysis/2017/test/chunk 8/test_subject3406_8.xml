	<TEXT> It's complicated. There is validity to the perspective that it is wrong to take a kid out of the custody of a parent over a parent's choice to not select a certain medical treatment, and that it's wrong to force a 17-y-o to undergo a medical treatment. In a year, she could have said no and nobody could force her otherwise, so why does that year make a difference?

On the other hand, would we allow a seventeen year old with a non-terminal illness to make the decision to kill herself? Would we intervene if her mother was planning to let her kill herself? Would we intervene to forcibly prevent a seventeen year old from killing herself?

Both perspectives apply to Cassandra's situation. Chemotherapy is awful, it's painful, it has terrible side effects, it is intentionally putting poison into one's body. But Hodgkin's Lymphoma, if treated with chemotherapy, is curable at rates of 85%. And once the terribleness of chemo is over, one goes on to live a good, full life.

We wouldn't force an adult to undergo medical treatment, even when failing to do so would kill them. Doing so to someone who is so close to being an adult is disturbing.

But we also don't allow kids to kill themselves. Allowing a 17-year-old to die from cancer instead of undergoing a temporarily awful treatment with an 85% chance of saving her life is also disturbing.

I don't have a great answer. If it was me, I'd take the chemo. If it was my kid, I'd force her to take the chemo. And if I was the kid's doctor, I'd do everything in my power to legally save my patient's lifeI don't blame the docs or the State in this. There's no great, obvious winning answer here. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The wireless service contract that was screwed up was a cell phone wireless service contractit was a contract to provide cell service throughout the metro system, including in underground tunnels and stations.

Currently, many (most?) stations have cell service at the platform, but the signal drops to nothingness once the train moves away from the platform. That is the case at L'Enfant Plaza-there is cell service on the station and for a short distance beyond it, then there's no signal until one gets above ground at the 14th street bridge (and signal then drops to nothingness once one goes below ground until one gets to the Pentagon station).

We were lucky that the train stopped close enough to the platform for the firefighters to still have cell phone coverage. Another five or ten seconds of train travel time and that wouldn't have been the case. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Utterly unacceptable. And we should count ourselves lucky that the train was disabled close enough to the L'Enfant Plaza station for cell phones to work.

Under a federal funding deal in 2008, wireless service was required to be available throughout the Metro system by December 2012. Metro blew the deadline, and said it would take until December 2015. Then the contractor filed for bankruptcy and sought to get out of the contract. That's the last I heard, so, best case scenario is 12 more months, and I sure wouldn't be betting on that.

And cell service is what firefighters had to rely on for outside communications. One more example of Metro's "culture of safety". </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Are you this rude to everyone, Gahgeer?

A crime is a crime. There is no carveout for war crimes or exceptional crimes or this-is-really-bad crimes. 

Moreover, in 1995, there had already been no shortage of allegations of war crimes levied by Palestinians against Israelis and by Israelis against Palestinians. Events like the Sabra and Shatila massacres on one side, and the first intifada on the other side (to give one example each-clearly one could spend paragraphs and paragraphs for either side), were on the minds of all parties. A crime is a crime, and the Oslo Accords give Israel jurisdiction over all criminal offenses in the Territory, be it petty or grand, but it is not accidental that this delegation of jurisdiction includes war crimes-it was intentional.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Under the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, the ICC's jurisdiction is based on delegationmembers of the ICC delegate part of their jurisdiction to the ICC. The Oslo Accords preclude such a delegation on the part of Palestine. Oslo II (Annex II of the 1995 agreement) Article I limits Palestinian criminal jurisdiction to "offenses committed by Palestinians and/or non-Israelis in the Territory", with "territory" referring  to the Gaza Strip, the West Bank, and theoretically, East Jerusalem. Under the Oslo Accords, Israel has exclusive criminal jurisdiction over offenses committed by Israelis in Gaza and the West Bank.

Seeking to delegate criminal jurisdiction over alleged Israeli crimes to the ICC, therefore, is a breach of the Oslo Accords. (EDIT: AKA the Palestinian Authority is seeking to delegate to the ICC jurisdiction that it exclusively gave to Israel under the Oslo Accords.)

Which isn't to say that both sides haven't breached various portions of the Oslo Accords numerous times, but neither side have formally backed out of the Accords either. And so given the Palestinian Authority's most recent breach of the Accords (trying to join the ICC), Israel's suspension of one of its commitments under the Accords (collecting and transferring tax revenue to the PA) seems a proportional response. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No Child Left Behind (NCLB) is mostly a red herring. The Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) has been around since 1965. It has been reauthorized many times since, with various changes and tweaks with each reauthorization. NCLB was the most recent reauthorization of the ESEA, done in 2001. NCLB added various high-stakes testing provisions, accountability provisions, etc., which have been controversial. But the proposed changes aren't looking to do away with just the NCLB provisions-they are seeking to remove most Federal oversight of, and requirements for, Federal education funds.

Traditionally under the ESEA, even before NCLB, there were many strings attached to Federal education funds. Title I funds, intended to help compensate for poor schools and poor school districts, had to be used for Title I schoolsa district with a range of schools, some Title I, some not, couldn't receive Title I funds and apply it to the non-Title I schools. You can't use Federal funds intended to help students to instead buy watches for principals as a reward for a job well done. Or a break room refrigerator. Or cars for personal use. You can't receive IDEA funds intended to benefit special education students to instead buy desks for all students. Etc.

AND, and this is a big restriction, for most Federal education grants, states must use Federal funds to supplement state education funds, not supplant. This means that one cannot get $20 million dollars from the Federal government in grant X and use it reduce the amount the state puts into education by $20 million. That $20 million dollars must be used to supplement existing education funding, not be a substitute for state funds.

Some don't like these restrictions, and want to be able to use Federal funds as they see fit. People calling for the elimination of the U.S. Department of Education or a reduced role of the Federal government in education are not usually calling for the elimination or reduction of the money the Federal government gives to states for education. Instead, they are calling for the strings to be cutfor states to get a big pot of money (AKA block grant) that they can do whatever they want withthat they can treat the same way they treat their own general (state and local) funds, be it buying principals watches or supplanting state funds.

The TL;DR version is that people aren't arguing for a reduction of Federal money going to education, they are arguing that states should have no restrictions on how the money can be spent. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Nope, I'm afraid not. You are confusing the Preamble of the Constitution with Article I, Section 8. What the Court said in Jacobson was that the preamble was a statement of purpose and not a source of substantive power. Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution, however, gives Congress the authority to "pay the debts and provide for the common defense and general welfare of the United States". That IS a source of substantive power-it's the body of the Constitution as opposed to the preamble. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is the first step to Congressional Republicans turning the country into Kansas. Since Kansas, under the leadership of Governor Brownback, cut taxes for the rich and raised taxes on the poor in the name of encouraging economic growth, Kansas has been creating jobs far slower than its peer states and its tax revenues have plummeted, leaving the state with large revenue shortfalls.

Congressional Republicans want to institute similar tax policies. Their problem (besides these policies not working in practice) is that the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the office tasked with determining the predicted economic impact of a bill (AKA scoring a bill) uses reality-based economics to predict whether a bill (be it tax cuts, spending, etc.) will cause revenue to go up, go down, etc. and by how much. Using reality-based scoring, Republicans' economic plans seem unfeasible. The GOP's solution is to fire the head of the CBO and replace him with someone who will go along with their plan to use dynamic scoringa form of scoring a bill that assumes that tax cuts magically kickstart the economy and that tax increases magically damage the economy. AKA using the assumptions that have failed in practice so badly in Kansas.

This is but one more example of the party that believes that government does not work doing everything in its power to ensure that it is right. </TEXT>

Moreover, it's worth noting that the NYPD's ban of chokeholds goes back to 1985, when an order from then-police commissioner Raymond Kelly stated, "choke holds, which are potentially lethal and unnecessary, will not be routinely used", and only permitted their use when an officer's life was in danger and the chokehold was the "least dangerous alternative method of restraint". The 1993 order took away that exceptionno chokeholds because of the unreasonable risk of lethality.

Until its tested, it is unclear if making reasonable modifications to dishes for people with disabilities is required under the ADA. But that it is unclear does not mean that restaurants are under no obligation to do it. Tomorrow, a decision could come out in a circuit affirming that reasonable modifications are mandated by the ADA, and it would not mean that from that day forward, restaurants in that circuit would have to make modifications. It would mean that restaurants should have been doing so all along, and anyone who was denied a reasonable accomodation in that circuit within the statute of limitations (arguably either the state's personal injury statute of limitations or the 4 year federal statute of limitationsthe actual timeframe can be complicated and not relevant here) can sue and have a decent shot at winning.

Court decisions are differentthey aren't making law, they're a declaration of the law is and has been. A court decision saying that people were supposed to wear purple on Thursdays can apply to people who failed to wear purple before the decision came out. </TEXT>

"What might a restaurant or other similar place of public accommodation need to do to accommodate an individual with celiac disease or other food allergies?

A: A restaurant may have to take some reasonable steps to accommodate individuals with disabilities where it does not result in a fundamental alteration of that restaurant's operations. By way of example only, this may include: 1) answering questions from diners about menu item ingredients, where the ingredients are known, or 2) omitting or substituting certain ingredients upon request if the restaurant normally does this for other customers."

Restaurants are not required to serve gluten-free or allergen-free food, but if they can make reasonable substitutions or modifications, they may be required to do so. </TEXT>

EDIT: The Q A may be useful too: http://www.ada.gov/q a_lesley_university.htm  Note questions 5 and 6: 

Five. What might a restaurant or other similar place of public accommodation need to do to accommodate an individual with celiac disease or other food allergies?

A: A restaurant may have to take some reasonable steps to accommodate individuals with disabilities where it does not result in a fundamental alteration of that restaurant's operations. By way of example only, this may include: 1) answering questions from diners about menu item ingredients, where the ingredients are known, or 2) omitting or substituting certain ingredients upon request if the restaurant normally does this for other customers.

Six. What is a fundamental alteration?
A: A fundamental alteration is a modification that is so significant that it alters the essential nature of the good or services that a business offers. For example, a restaurant is not required to alter its menu or provide different foods to meet particular dietary needs"

	<TEXT> Well, one recent settlement agreement was negotiated between the Department of Justice and Lesley University in Boston. The DOJ alleged that Lesley failed to make reasonable accommodations that would allow people with celiac disease and food allergies to "fully and equally enjoy the privileges, advantages, and accommodations of its food service and meal plan system." This was a voluntary agreement, not a court decision, but the agreement says in part, "Food allergies may constitute a disability under the ADA, 42 U.S.C.  12102. Individuals with food allergies may have an autoimmune response to certain foods, the symptoms of which may include difficulty swallowing and breathing, asthma, and anaphylaxis."

There is a difference between a restaurant and a universitythe university setting often imposes the cost of meal plans on students (as opposed to the choice of going to a restaurant or not), so there is somewhat of a special setting involved. But, both restaurants and institutes of higher learning are places of public accommodation within the definition and scope of the ADA. As I said, I'm not aware of a lawsuit against a restaurant over not accommodating a request under the ADA, but I'd be shocked if one didn't rise to public attention in the next decade. (It takes a long time to get to a circuit court, which is probably what's needed to really hit the newsdistrict court decisions, settlements, etc. seldom hit the big time.) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This may be an unpopular response. I know things like this makes life really difficult for chefs, and that there is a point where the kitchen may want to just tell a person no. (And I agree with /u/LittleOrangeCat that it seems odd they did not specify what the food allergens are).

That said, its worth noting that allergies can be a protected disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act. I am unaware of any caselaw on food allergy issues in restaurants specifically, but cases are trickling through the courts on how the ADA as amended in '08 applies to people with food allergies. Generally, post the 2008 amendments, people with food allergies of a certain severity have been found to be disabled for the purpose of the statute, and so failing to make reasonable accommodations for a person with food allergies may be actionable.

Of course, step two is what is a reasonable accommodation? Not every restaurant is going to have the ability to accommodate every food allergy. In this case, if this person meant "new pan", "new spatula", etc. to be a NEW pan, spatula, etc. instead of a CLEAN pan, spatula, etc., that may stretch the definition of reasonable in reasonable accommodation to its breaking point. If they were only asking for extra caution in ensuring no cross-contamination by making sure things were clean, not using dairy/eggs, etc., that might be considered reasonable in a court of law.

Just a point to bear in mind, and I'll otherwise return to lurking, as I'm interested in the food service industry but not a member and I don't want to step on anyone's toes. :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi all. Over the weekend, I bought a korean-style indoor bbq plate/ringthe kind that sort of looks like a hubcap on top of a ring that catches drippings and can hold liquid to steam things/stop things from smoking.

The instructions say that if it does not fit on a gas stove  grate, one can take off the grate and put a cooling rack there instead. I bought a small cooling rack, put the bbq device on top, but when I cooked with it, it started glowing red and deforming (aka slowly melting, pretty much). Not its fault-it clearly wasn't meant for that-but I'm wondering what to use as a substitute?

Are there other cooling racks that are high heat-safe? Would a wok ring do the trick? What am I looking for? </TEXT>

And more importantly, you can learn anything you need to for the bar from a bar prep course. Don't waste a class on something that you aren't interested in and don't think will help you in practice or in the job hunt. If you're interested in, say, Trusts and Estates, then yestake Trusts and Estates. If you think you might want to go into private practice in Family Law, or in General Practice, then yestake Trusts and Estates. If the only reason you're considering taking it is because it's on the bar, DON'T. Classes are preciouspick good ones.

Moving beyond the impromptu PSA to your question, like all classes, Admin law can be made awesome or terrible by a professor, but it is a very useful class. I wholeheartedly agree with /u/shanedoth and others who said it is the second-most useful substantive class after evidence. It touches upon nearly every other area of law. Personal injury lawyer whose client hit/was hit by on-duty Federal employee? Admin law! Food and drug law? Admin law! Environmental law? Admin law! Consumer product safety? Admin law! The list goes on and on. </TEXT>

When out and about with a friend who is blind, I'd see her try to hail and cab and nobody would stop. I'd try and get a cab in 30 seconds or less.

And 20% of the time when I was trying to get from downtown to Bethesda, I'd be told to get out of the cab or cab drivers would try to convince me to pay a flat rate that would be $10 higher than what the meter would be.

Uber is popular because cabs suck, and the DC Taxicab Commission has historically allowed cabs to suck. I'm not shocked that 84 of 308 potential customers were refused cab ridesI'm shocked that the DC Taxi Commission conducted such a study and I'm shocked that they released such a study. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There is a downloadable $70 student version of Windows 8.1 available from Microsoft, but be warned that to actually download it, you'll need access to a Windows machine because the thing you initially download is a 6MB exe app to do the download. (It can be frustrating as mac users to need Windows to download Windows.) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Don't think of it as a "traffic ticket", think of it as a criminal charge and respond appropriately by getting a lawyer. In most jurisdictions, fighting a traffic ticket is about trying to reduce or eliminate the amount of the fine. In Virginia, fighting a traffic ticket can be about trying to reduce or eliminate the amount of time spent in jailit's not something I'd want to handle on my own. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I loved Administrative Law. I think it's definitely a course that is made or broken by the professor, more so than most, given the unsettled and shifting nature of the caselaw.

Leaving aside classes where I was less than thrilled with the professor and looking solely at content, I'd have to say I hated property law the most. It was just so damn pointless. It's the hot dog of the law school curriculum, taking all the scraps and gristle left behind from the good stuff that gets it's own class. Wills, Trusts, and Estates, Divorce Law/Family Law, Real Estate, Commercial Transactions, etc., all the big stuff that one thinks would be property gets it own class, leaving behind the crap like the rule against perpetuities.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You might well be right. Yosemite could come with new hardwareit wouldn't shock me, but I'd be surprised... My guess is we'll see a more major update to the MBP early next year with Broadwell chips and possibly a redesign. July's update just bumped up processor speed. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> At the risk of being downvoted for ignoring what you said about avoiding Coinstar machines, did you know that Coinstar doesn't charge any fees if you get payment in the form of gift cards? I recently took 9 or 10 years of saved coins and got $70 in Amazon.com credit. I use Amazon all the time anyway, so it seemed just as good as cash. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Serving papers can fall within the US Marshals Service's (USMS) bailiwick, particularly where there is danger or impracticality in having others do it. The USMS does not do their own investigations, save for fugitive investigations. They may assist with other investigations where they have particular expertise, but they aren't going to be the lead agency in a fraud case, for example.

As the prime enforcement arm of the courts (but an Executive Branch, not a Judicial Branch agency, mind you), US Marshals go after fugitives, serve court papers (including warrants, summons, etc.), protect judges and courthouses, assists with federal prisoner transports, and runs the witness protection program. 

The USMS can also be the agency given odd jobs by statute, such as Adam Walsh Act giving the USMS responsibility for aiding state and local law enforcement with finding and arresting sex offenders who do not comply with sex offender registration, or the USMS essentially acting in the role of a county sheriff in Washington, DC because there IS no county-level sheriff's office. (In DC, US Marshals handle evictions, for example, something that they don't touch with a 20 foot pole anywhere else. They also handle both federal and DC prisoner transport, federal and DC courthouse security, process servers of last resort for DC-level civil cases, etc.) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> First, does this provide probable cause to pull over every car with a small kid in the back texting on their phone? (Small kid=not something a cop can be expected to see as a car goes by.)

Second, as others have mentioned, with handsfree devices, one can translate texts to speech and speaks to text.

Third, I am skeptical that the technology is savy enough to distinguish between a text and data from legal apps like Google Maps, Waze, and similar apps that are entirely for the purpose of being run while someone is driving. (And if it can distinguish between data and texts, then police are supposed to spend lots of money on devices that can only catch texters but not people emailing while driving?) </TEXT>
