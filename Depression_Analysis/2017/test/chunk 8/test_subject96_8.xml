	<TEXT> This is a clear violation of the FLSA. Even if you weren't missing work for military service, as long as you work or attempt to work 40 hours a week, your employer must pay you your full salary for that week.

It's important for your employer to understand the potential downsides of what they're doing. Exempt refers to an exemption from regular hourly pay and overtime rules. If they violate the specific rules for exempt employees, they lose that exemption. 

That means that they must pay you overtime for all the hours you work over 40 in a week. And this can be applied retroactively. Which means you can sue them for back pay for every hour you've worked over 40 in a week going back to the time you were hired.

	<TEXT> Here's a question for you and for any resume adviser or job counselor debating how to put a McDonald's job on a resume. Do you think that the people most likely to read that resume, hiring manager or HR person or whoever, has never heard of McDonald's or is unaware of the kind of work people do there? Do you think that if you manage to present your burger-flipping and toilet-mopping duties in a sufficiently good light that you will convince any professional hiring person that your job there was any more than it was?

As others have noted, a fast food job can be a positive thing. It shows you can show up on time, learn new tasks, follow instructions and get along with your team. If you try to jump it up with crap like "strategically upselling menu items", the best you can hope for is that you'll make the resume reader laugh. It's more likely that your resume gets thrown in the "no" pile for rank stupidity.

	<TEXT> Your company will tell you how you should treat them. 

If your company treats people with professionalism and respect when they leave, letting them work out their two weeks or simply paying them for that time and sending them their way, then you give your proper notice as expected.

If they abuse people who are leaving, berating them and not letting them serve out their notice, then you don't give notice. Alternately, you can give two weeks notice on Friday, but plan to start  your new job the following Monday, expecting them to fire you. That way your can honestly claim you gave your expected two weeks.

	<TEXT> Hey, you fucked up. It happens. You didn't understand your limitations so you overpromised and underdelivered. That's not a bad fuckup for someone just starting out. 

Just make sure that:

1) You understand what you did wrong

2) You know why it was wrong

3) You know why you did it

4) You know how to avoid it in the future.

Otherwise it sounds like you did some good work there and you don't want to throw that out the window. It might not be a bad idea to call up the place you interned at and see what they're going to say about you when you give them as a reference.

Good luck. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The details vary from state to state, but generally, to collect unemployment you must have worked a certain minimum amount during the "base period" before you file.  

In almost every state, the base period is a one-year period: the earliest four of the last five complete quarters of the calendar year. For example, if you apply for unemployment in March 2015, the base period would be October 1, 2013 though September 30, 2014.

So these two months could be added to your base period credit if you file for unemployment in the future. </TEXT>

And while you may not be eligible for unemployment now, after only working there for two months, that work should be added to the service time with your next job so you'll be eligible for unemployment sooner. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The main downsides of 1099 vs W-2 are:

1) Self employment tax. As a 1099, you must pay 15.3% of your income for FICA/Medicare. As a W-2, you pay half of that and your employer pays the other half.

2) Unemployment insurance: As a 1099 worker, you are not eligible for unemployment insurance. As a W2, you are.

3) Employee protections: As a W2 worker, you have much greater protection for things that might happen on the job. A lot of these protections (sexual harassment, FLSA, etc.) do not apply to 1099 workers.

If you're reclassified, you'll get some of these benefits back and your employer will have to pay. Plus they'll probably have to pay a fine and cover other costs, like workman's comp, that don't apply to 1099 workers.

Good luck! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There's a little more information [at this link](http://easthamptonstar.com/Government/2015605/Uber-Pulls-Plug-Ride-Service-East-Hampton-Town)

A taxi law adopted several years ago and revised in 2014 requires cab companies to have a town business license, licenses for each of their vehicles, which triggers inspections by town ordinance enforcement officers, and licenses for individual drivers. 

I think if there was an easy workaround, Uber would have found it. Seems as if each individual Uber driver has to have a business license, a town license and an office. I suppose a bunch of Uber drivers could club together and get an office, but they'd still need all that other stuff. 

That doesn't fit Uber's business model. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's unlikely that any corporation would attempt to enforce these low level non-competes and it's even less likely that they would hold up in court. But that's not the point.

Your average, hourly worker doesn't know that these agreements are generally garbage and so they create a chilling effect on employees, who will be less likely to leave and seek new employment because of the agreement they signed.

Plus, low paid workers don't generally have access to legal representation if some vindictive business owner tries to enforce one out of spite. </TEXT>
