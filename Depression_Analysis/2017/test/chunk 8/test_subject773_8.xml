	<TEXT> I did look up Indian bits, but didn't find anything that similar.  :/

And as for the rust -- I'm sure that's part of it, but he really likes the fact that it's just a big straight bar and not jointed in any way.  If I could show him in it I would! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hmm, I looked on ebay with no luck.  The Indian bits seem to be similar only because they have the extra rings.  I looked up thorn bits, but no dice there either -- many of them have crazy looking spiked ports.  The only one I've ever found close to it was in this bit collection on ebay:  http://i.imgur.com/ewAftSx.jpg  The third one down is very much the same, except with a slow twist instead of the ribs. I wish I could have afforded it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My barn owns this bit and my horse is obsessed with it, as are many other horses in training.  It's his happy bit -- he works well in it, loves it, and we use it on him whenever its appropriate.  However, we only have one. My trainer pulled it out of some "big rusty bargain bin of bits" years ago and we have NO idea where to get another!  

Does anyone know what this kind of bit is called?  Has anyone ever seen one?  Do any of you own one?  It's a big 'ol mystery to us! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ladies and gents, my good friend finds herself without a job after this holiday season, and is having problems finding something new due to an odd looking resume.  In short -- after some medical issues took her out of the workplace for several years, she decided to become a horse trainer, which she did for several more years, until now.  Basically, she has an odd blank spot in her resume that employers don't like, and even after applying to 65+ jobs, has nothing to show for it.  

Preferences include some kind of receptionist/administrative assistant job, something in a law office, etc.  Really though, retail, sales, or whatever would work at this point.  Part time would be ok.  Things are going to get tough for her if she doesn't find anything soon and I don't know how else to help her than put the word out on here.

I can send a resume to anyone who is interested, or thinks their employer might be hiring.  She is smart and easy to like, and also hysterically funny.  If I could offer her a job I would, but I'm just not in that position right now.

Thanks Reddit, you're the best. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not sure on the footing, but usually it's a mixture of tanbark and sand and dirt.  The green color is traditional for this show and is made from dying woodchips.  

So since this class is all about speed (while maintaining a correct frame) it's a combination of pushing your horse forward while bringing him back a bit to get him to collect.  For most of these ponies, they want to GO GO GO!  When I have shown them, you don't cluck much to move them on, you just stop telling them to slow down!  And you have to slow down in those tight corners as well, and lean into them so you don't flip the cart.  So yes, you can hear the driver's voice telling the pony to slow down, and then as they call for faster and faster speeds, she says less and just lets him fly! 

Conformation and manners also plays into the judging, as well as head carriage and correct motion of the gait.  I'd love to show one again -- so fun! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Wow, quick response, and a good answer!  I had no idea so much went into it, though I'm not surprised it's so complex.  I am not a natural redhead, but I have heard about things related to redheads and anesthesia.  At the time I had both surgeries, I wasn't on any medications at all.  Though it is interesting that you mention Klonopin, because I've been taking that for the past couple years now.  If I need to go under again and am still on the Klonopin, maybe I'll be easier to handle. :) </TEXT>

As in, I think they had to give me more anesthesia than they thought.  Does it have to do with a person's age?  Size?  I'm 27, female, and 120 lbs at 5'3".

Just wondering why I've been compared to "trying to take down a rhino."  Lol. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Holy crap Dan, that was a fast reply!  I may indeed be up for dinner with your and your ladyfriend.  I'll be living in what I think is Near East (right by Olbrich).  I'm a very social person and like having a large group of friends that enjoy doing things on a fairly regular basis.  Generally, I'm up for most things.  Going out, staying in, having potlucks/grilling out, going to museums/concerts/.  

I bit about me, I suppose.  I'm a 27 year old female currently living in Minneapolis and finishing my Master's thesis in Landscape Architecture.  The job at Olbrich is just a stop-gap internship while I find work in a design firm.  That job may be in Madison (if I fall in love with the place and there is work), or I may be moving in the fall to one of the coasts in hopes of getting a job out there.  I will also be continuing my job for the University of Minnesota as the copyeditor of the Landscape Journal, which will keep me a bit busy, at least for the summer.

I really appreciate you writing back so quickly!  The next few weeks are going to be tough as I uproot myself from the safety of graduate school and the friends I have made over the last 9 years of living in Minneapolis.  However, as we all know, change is necessary, and I sincerely hope the best is yet to come in my life!

I'll be in touch,

	<TEXT> Greetings Madison!

I'll be moving to your fine city in about a month.  This marks my terrifying transition from graduate school up here in Minneapolis to the "real world", where people are married, have babies, and don't have time for new friends.  I know a few folks in Madison, but they are all married, or insanely busy, or both.  No babies though...yet.

WHO ARE YOU PEOPLE?  Where should I go to meet up with some lovely, intelligent folks?  I see you have some bar meetups, and I plan on hanging out at coffeeshops, concerts, and the like, but how do you really meet people?  I'll be working at an internship at Olbrich Gardens, but as I'm the oldest intern by quite a few years, I don't think I'll be making many friends there with whom I would like to spend time outside of work.  

Anyways, let me know if you have some ideas.  PM me if you'd like to introduce yourself!  I'd love to get to know a few folks before I move, as this transition is proving to be particularly anxiety producing.  However, let it be known, I'm just coming out of a relationship and won't be looking for a "romantic connection" right off the bat.

See you all in a month! </TEXT>
