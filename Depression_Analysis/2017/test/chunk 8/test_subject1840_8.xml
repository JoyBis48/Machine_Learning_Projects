	<TEXT> Whole idea behind homeopathy sounds really stupid but my experience and my wife's telling that it could help. And I believe more my experience then  top Aussie Uni research centers. I can take stuff from jungle medicine men but only one condition - got to work properly - doesn't matter reason or theory or ideology. 
One big advantage, it is so diluted that couldn't poison you - many thing from chemist shop really can. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you will waiting for last minute to cancel your subscription you'll be definitely charged for the first month.
I enrolled and when I tried to cancel udacity several times (!!!) ask me to change my password to make sure it's really me - and all this time curse was on the list. So, if you want to cancel make sure you have half an hour to end of the trial.

I know , my first post was too dramatic   ;))    - just to make some attention for the problem - you know: in murky water easier to catch a fish

and  sorry for my English - it's not my first language </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is what I thought. But I couldn't find the link to view that stuff only enroll button where you must give bank account details and if you forget cancel enrollment before 1 week trial is done they will charge you for 1 month - $200.

Any one know a way to view nanodegree without giving bank details?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Udacity nanodegree - is it next way to pull money from people who forgot to cancel after they enrolled  and give bank card details? Or is any way to access nano-course materials without banks details? 
Isn't rip off to charge folks $200/month for MOOC? Estimated cost of one MOOC is 100k - 200k $. If will be 100k (as usually) and every one only forgot to cancel that will be profit circa 200M $ !!!???
That's better business than Apple, Google and Microsoft together. </TEXT>
