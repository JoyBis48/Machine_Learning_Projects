	<TEXT> You're right, there absolutely are flaws in the system and the US desperately needs a better health care system but I don't believe for a moment this is the right fix.

Regardless of how we personally disagree, there's no doubt people have had their insurance canceled and their doctors don't take ACA, and certainly a lot of people like me who simply cannot afford it. People like myself aren't taking to the Internet to lie about our experiences. I was laid off late last year because the company I worked for was failing and couldn't afford my salary, I got on unemployment and still had to pay almost $700 in penalties because of ACA. Passing it hasn't helped me one bit. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's great that you've had a positive experience with ACA, but that doesn't negate the negative experiences that others are having.

I couldn't afford insurance then, and I can't afford it now. I took the hit on my taxes cause it was much cheaper than paying just a few months worth of coverage. Just because you can say you've never seen it happen doesn't mean it's not happening. I haven't personally seen the annexation of Crimea, I've never held a billion dollars, I don't know anyone who's won the lottery, but all of those exist, can happen or have happened. 

The other side of it is the affect it's having on doctors. My uncle is a doctor with his own pratice, and the ACA is killing him financially. It's taking months to get reimbursement from an ACA plan, which means he's basically working for free and doesn't have any money to cover overhead like everyday operations costs. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's actually a relief to read this. I'm on day 2 and I know I'm not going to see weight loss *yet*, but I'm fearful of being the rare person to not lose any. Reading all the success stories can almost seem too good to be true, so it's nice to know that if one falters, it's worthwhile to stick with it.
Thank you for sharing your experience!! </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Its day two on Keto. My husband and I are traveling a bit today, so the only decent road lunch option was McDonald's. I got a bacon cheeseburger wrapped in lettuce instead of a bun (no side), and my husband got a large fry with his meal.

The thing is, potatoes are my *obsession.* Fries, tots, hashbrowns, baked, scalloped...you name, I would destroy it.

He ate not even half of the box, and usually I'd finish them off after eating my own large fry, but today? Today I ignored everything in my body that screamed FINISH HIM in a Mortal Combat voice. I balled up my trash, stuffed it in the fry box and threw it all out.
I'm so stupidly proud of myself. Self - restraint is not one of my strengths by any stretch of the imagination, but maybe I can do this after all!!

EDIT: Goodness, I love this community. Every time I post here I get so much encouragement, support, and direction. Thank you, you guys rock :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> True but that's a totally different situation. I will gladly give help to someone, anyone in need. But not someone asking for help because "they get X, I should get Y." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sorry, no magic here!! I made them at home, using nutritiondata.com for the nutritional content, but I put into MPF that I used *all* 2 pounds in 1 taco, then x how many tacos I ate. I feel like such a dope! I fixed it and I'm still over for the day because I had steak for lunch, but it's *so much closer!* </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That makes me feel way better, there's no way I ate a whole pound of meat in those tacos. I'll look into it and see where I can find the mistake, and I'll be vigilant of weighing everything instead of relying on food I search for on MPF's database. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not using a scale yet, it will be in tomorrow. I'm gonna crunch some more numbers and see what's up cause MPF is saying the tacos alone were 136g. I thought it sounded wrong when I saw the amount of calories they supposedly are, especially because I used lettuce shells. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Again, thank you! I ordered a scale, it'll be in tomorrow. I did seriously over do it on meat today. I had steak, seared shrimp then lettuce-shelled tacos. This was definitely a big lesson, I won't let this happen again. </TEXT>
