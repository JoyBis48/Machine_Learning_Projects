	<TEXT> If they were to cancel it, I would want CBS to let the creators give the show a proper send off and finish off all the story points. However I don't want the show to end because it's just too good, hopefully Netflix picks it up and ups the budget (one can dream, can they not?) </TEXT>

	<TITLE> What real life corporations is Deus Ex:HR referencing? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-04-14 06:16:16 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So throughout the series, corporations are obviously a big part of the game and in Human Revolution they go into greater detail of these different corporations, which i'm guessing are loosely based of real life corporations who have monopolies in certain markets. 

1. Tai Yong Medical, could we align them to real life companies like Pfizer or Glaxo Smith Kline?

2. Picus Media, perhaps they are based off News Corp, Comcast, Viacom? 

2. Belltower Associates, this one is pretty straightforward as we can attribute them security contractors like Academi (formally known as Blackwater) or DynCorp

3. Sarif Industries, This one for me is harder to pinpoint, it seems to be an amalgamation of different real life companies put into one company. Maybe Boston Dynamics or maybe Cyberdyne (yes that is the real name of a Japanese robotics company, I am worried).

What do you guys think, I may be completely off here.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey guys I am visiting from Sydney, Australia and I will be arriving on the 23 April and checking the place out for a few days, can anyone recommend a place to take some good photos, especially at night time (neon lights etc). Last time in Singapore I only had a day to check out the city, so this time I will be able to venture around a bit more.

	<TEXT> Sorry but I have to disagree, just because HBO's subscription method is a bit much (although they are releasing a standalone subcription only service soon), the quality of content they produce is still unsurpassed, no other network makes shows as remotely close to quality and production as Game of Thrones, The Wire, Sopranos, Boardwalk Empire. Those are just a few shows as well. If they were to budget this show like Game of Thrones than you would probably see the most realised vision of Rapture or Infinite on television.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So the film adaptation for Bioshock 1 got shut down a while ago now, how do you guys think the story of Bioshock 1 or Inifite would work as a TV series? Ideally it would be awesome to have a HBO budgeted series but I can understand the high risk involved with that. If it was Bioshock 1, should it be set before the events of the first game and show Rapture's downfall? Or do you guys think Bioshock Infinite's overall story lends itself to a television series better?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Do you guys think that FO4's main character should have a voice or be silent like previous entries? I see an upside and downside to this. 

Upside: Greater character development and more immersive for the player (at least for me). 

Downside: More voice work will limit the amount of dialogue choices and the character may not be likeable for every player.

	<TEXT> So I watched the first season of the show and seemed to enjoy it for what it was however I did watch it though when nothing else was on so it was rather a distraction until everything else started back up again. I was wondering how the second season is? Is it worth reinvesting the time to watch the show again? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was at this game and there was lots of booing from the crowd and then it slowly subsided after 10 minutes as everyone probably realised it was more serious.

	<TEXT> Personally I am rooting for the P1. Ever since I played Need for Speed II all those years back, the Mclaren F1 has and still is my favourite super car ever made and the P1 reminded me of the F1 just in it's sheer ridiculousness. My other pick would be the 918 since that car is pushing the hybrid technology forward the most out of the 3 also I feel that it looks a ton better than the La Ferrari. 

La Ferrari is the last one for me since I always feel that Ferrari are always up themselves in terms of how they present their brand. Don't get me wrong they make great cars however how the way they present themselves to motor journalists and car enthusiasts, just turns me off them. I know I didn't really analyse from a technical POV which would come first, this is just who I want to come first.  </TEXT>
