	<TEXT> I'm actually looking at buying a tank. I really like the convenience of not re-dripping as often. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I really did feel very uncomfortable and intimidated. It was upsetting that he felt the need to do that. I'm not cop-shaming or saying all cops are bad, but he didn't do anything to reverse the bad image cops already have. Little things like that make me mad. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I used to have an m80 with a plume veil RDA, but I sold it to a friend and now I have an ABS dual 18650 box mod with a Royal Hunter. I like it quite a bit, actually. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My brother is a long-time user of vapes and ejuice. He originally used it to ease himself off his chronic cigarette use, but he's now turned it into a hobby. He got me into it and I purchased a decent mod and RDA. 

I'm just wondering how many people here vape as well? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Went on a trip to 711 today... </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-07-16 00:44:19 </DATE>

	<TEXT> I do this trip two to three times a week on my way home. I stop by my local 711, pick up a lemon iced tea and a pack of Zig-Zag grape wraps. Usually the same employee is there to greet me each time I enter the store, and he remembers what I get and has the wraps waiting for me by the time I make it back to the counter with my iced tea in hand. Today, however, was different. There was a new employee this afternoon, and upon my request for the Zig-Zags, she sighed, gave me a dirty look, and took her time placing them on the counter. At this point a police officer is standing next to me paying for a coffee and a newspaper. He glances down at the counter, notices the wraps, and says to the cashier, "Do not sell those to him" in a stern, police-man voice. Now just listen to me really quick. I am your typical white kid. I have longer hair, but I usually pull it back so it looks neat and I don't come off as being a dirty hippy. I'm completely inconspicuous and have been living in the area and frequenting that 711 for as long as I can remember. Obviously someone buying blunt wraps sets off a red flag. Nobody I know buys them to actually roll their own cigars. But still! The cashier pauses, looks at the officer, smiles awkwardly, scans the wraps, and places them in the bag. He repeats himself again, "Do *NOT* sell those to him." This time you could tell he was serious. At this point the two of us are just standing in complete silence with confused looks on our faces. She hands me the bag and says the usual "Have a nice day" as I leave the store. I get in my car, pull back onto the road and notice the cop is behind me. He follows me for a good while, turning whenever I turn. I start getting a little paranoid, but know there's nothing wrong in the inherent act of purchasing the wraps; it's what I plan on doing with them  later that I don't want Mr. Policeman to see. I finally take the last turn onto my street and he continues on his route. I was more annoyed than anything during that encounter. I live in a city where it is decriminalized and not completely legal and can understand why that may have happened, but for the officer to tell the cashier not to sell them to me made me upset. What would you guys have done if you were put in a similar situation?

Hoping for the best future for the ents and their trees. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Buy a good sharpstone. Mine was $50, it's anodized, and it's on the bigger side ( I think 2.5-3"). I've had it for over a year and I use it very frequently. It's the only grinder my buddies and I use so it gets plenty of use. It feels nice in the hand, is very smooth when griding, and I definitely recommend it.  </TEXT>
