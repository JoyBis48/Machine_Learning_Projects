	<TEXT> Speyburn Braden Orach, no age date printed on this bottle of single malt scotch.

I take my scotch one ounce at a time, room temperature, with a dash of water. 

Color: pale yellow amber

Nose: yeasty, pear, orange, lemon, vanilla

Taste: honey, lemon, salt water taffy, cinnamon, faint sour watermelon candies

Finish: oily, oaky, spicy, and pleasantly long

This is a better Speyburn than the 10 year I reviewed before. I'm actually enjoying it very much.... and it costs only 21 bucks in Michigan. 80/100.

Now for the cheapskate's questionnaire:

1. How many bottles does it take to upgrade my beginner status? 

2. If I considered changing my titles to "A Cheapskate's Review" what is the maximum amount I should set for myself in those reviews? 

Don't worry, it's not going to keep me from periodically reviewing a pricier scotch. It's just that I see so many reviews of obscure and expensive scotch I want to give us little guys a chance. Thanks for reading!

EDIT: in question 2 by maximum amount I mean maximum amount of money in American dollars.

	<TEXT> Speyburn 10

Is it too soon for my next review? I burned through that last bottle of Glenfiddich pretty quick, damn that stuff was tasty. Oh well...I love scotch! Scotch, scotch, scotch, here it goes down....

I take my scotch one ounce at a time, room temperature, with a dash of water.

Color: yellow like a Cheerios box

Nose: apricot, green grapes, bubblegum, clover

Taste: woody, slighty smoky, dried banana, cranberry

Finish: watery, with a spicy burn, doesn't stay with you very long

This is a good single malt for the price (33 bucks in Michigan). It's not very complex. Not bad scotch by any means... but I'm not too excited about it.  68/100

See you next bottle!   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Glenfiddich 12 yr

Got my paycheck, time for another review!

I take my scotch one ounce at a time, room temperature, with a dash of water.

Color: faint orange like the stripes on a tabby cat

Nose: lime, butterscotch, nutmeg, caramel, roasted almonds

Taste: the box ain't lying when they say fresh pear, cinnamon, faint hint of mint and honey

Finish: oily, a little fire like I just finished eating a red hot candy

Overall this is the best scotch I've had so far (remember, I am a beginner!) and I can see myself buying more bottles of this in the future. I enjoy the complexity that this malt has to offer for the price, 42 bucks here in Michigan. 

90/100

	<TEXT> Glenmorangie 10 yr

I bought this for 44 bucks in Michigan. It was the last of an order of gift sets that my local liquor store had in stock. It came with two very classy scotch glasses that I use pretty much exclusively now. They are shaped to concentrate the nose with a weight that feels nice in the hand. 

I take my scotch one ounce at a time, room temperature, with a dash of water.

Color: very pale yellow

Nose: floral, butter, potpourri

Taste: pumpkin pie, sweet potatoes with marshmallow, pecans, coconut

Finish: fine notes of toffee, very smooth, doesn't stay with you too long

72/100

Perhaps I'm spoiled in my first bottle of scotch (read my first review) but there isnt much complexity here. This scotch doesn't have much personality, but I do like it. I would probably offer it to my friends that haven't tried scotch before to get them started.

I've always hated liqour, but I'm 30 years old now and I thought that it was about time to find a liquor I enjoy. After watching youtube videos for a while, and googling the hell out of the subject, I've decided to become a scotch drinker. Here is my first review.

The Black Grouse

I take my scotch one ounce at a time, room temperature,  with a dash of water.

Color: amber, like leaves in early fall

Nose: under-ripe oranges, lemon, hint of vanilla, maple syrup

Taste: smoke, sugar, burnt caramel

Finish: very dark chocolate, woody

As a beginner, I actually enjoyed this scotch very much. The price is right, too. Paid 26 dollars for this in Michigan. 78/100. 

My next review I'll post with when I get my next paycheck. I'm going to try Glenmorangie 10 year. I love scotch!
