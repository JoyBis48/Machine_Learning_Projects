	<TEXT> God damn I just want the reddit of 6 months ago!! The reddit where I didn't have to see Ellen pap everywhere, or news of how Bernie sanders now manages to have 7 voters instead of 6! I want a reddit where the most infuriating thing I saw on it was an overflow of cute animal pics on the front page. Oh how reddit is pulling out all the stops to fuck themselves over. I feel like /r/pinkfloyd needs a contingency plan for when everything goes tits up. Because this is a really good niche community and it'd be a shame if we lost it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Spotify does have it's own radio feature akin to Pandora, albeit not as diverse, in my opinion. However, every Tuesday Spotify has most of the albums that are released available to listen to. And you can search through all the new releases and play an album to see if it's something you like. Also when you search a band, there are generally 5 artists on the side bar that are "recommended".


And if you don't like the radio stations. Spotify has entire playlists too that you can listen to. For instance, instead of an alternative rock station like Pandora, you can listen to a playlist instead. In the playlist you can see all the songs included and play them when you want.

Also it's so much easier on spotify to keep track of all the songs you've favorited and add them to playlists to revisit later


Sometimes I ramble and don't get my point across, let me know if I confused ya at all. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [Request] Does anybody remember that art project a fellow redditor and posted it on here? It was the animals album cover and involved imprinting it onto wood. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-06-14 22:11:24 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I've searched this subreddit but unfortunately could not find it, so this is the only reason I'm making a post like this on here. So sorry if this isn't the most appropriate way to approach this, but I could really use the help.


There was this craft/project done by a fellow redditor that did some type of wood burning onto a blank piece of wood that was the cover of Animals. It was amazing and I was going to have my girlfriend do one for me, but I couldn't find the post. The original post included links to a DIY website as well. 

Thanks to anyone that is album to help me! </TEXT>
