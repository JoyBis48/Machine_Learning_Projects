	<TEXT> How do you think season 9 will open and where do you think everyone will end up?

I think Leonard and Penny will get married

Raj will continue dating Emily despite being weirded out by her

Howard and Bernadette will ether kick Stuart out within the first few episodes or something will happen to Stuart that forces them to let him stay with them. 

Not to sure about Sheldon. He might try and get Amy back but the way they ended the episode it seems pretty clear the relationship is over at least for now. Really looking forward to see how the writers handle this.

	<TEXT> Mean while Civil War will actually be the big kahuna that we're all waiting for and marvel decided that age of ultron along with ant-man were just a bridge to fill the gap while we wait. It was almost like a filler episode of a tv show setting up and teasing whats to come and didn't really move the plot forward aside from meeting some new characters. Maybe this was intentional or I just picked up on it due to Whedons background work on TV? It just felt like an episode of a tv show that plays before the finale you know what I mean? </TEXT>

I guess we're to assume that a lot of stuff happened off screen between him and cap but id sort of like an explanation of what happened I mean sure he helped out in Ultron but does that make him worthy to be a member of the avengers? I guess maybe stark recommended him to cap as his replacement? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> yea its fair. i liked the first movie and loved guardians and cap 2. I found the first half of ultron a bit boring and tedious to get through.I didn't start appreciating the twins till the second half of the film. It definitely shows that Whedon is running out of ideas and its probably a good thing hes not doing infinity war. id say its fair. Ill be a bit worried if it keeps dropping though.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Heres some of my ideas

Have an original avenger die. e.g stark or cap

Spider-Man swings in making his first appearance in an avengers movie. 

Have the avengers actually do some serious damage to thanos, thanos withdraws but we see a credit scene with him and his real army of villains and what ever aliens he might have at his disposal, ready to return in part 2. 

The guardians arrive to save the day. 

Got any other cool ideas?

	<DATE> 2015-04-19 03:45:38 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> There are too many story lines and we need to choose which ones we are focusing on and lift out the other ones, ie; could reduce father arc to just Roosevelt?
 
Could cut out plane crash and Richard destroying spiders and start on armored car  dont start with Spider-Man.let the danger/stakes to NYC build first and then have Spider-Man enter the scene heroically.
 
Tone down Paul Giamatti performance, so he seems a bit more menacing and less cartoonish.
 
If you cut Richard from the opening and the plane crash maybe you could instead do Harry coming home and seeing Norman at the top of the movie as a cold open.
 
Really love Electro  feels like you may not need the scene in his apartment, which makes him seems completely crazy and hard to relate too.
 
Like the idea that eel goes in his mouth and instead of burrowing, you see it glow within him
 
Need to set up the Power Plant earlier, visually.
 
Seems like the movie switches povs a lotwhy are we in Maxs pov during the car chase, worth looking at this playing out from Spideys pov.
 
There could be a better way to reveal that Peter is missing graduation  maybe when you cut Gwen you cut to the wide shot? 
 
Tiny note  dont think Peter would lie to Gwen about sirens --- maybe he just downplays it
 
Stan Lee Cameo  maybe need a little more emphasis on Peter here trying to get out of his costume and not be in seenset up a little more the pressure of the principal getting closer and closer to calling his name.
 
Instead of seeing the ghost of Captain Stacy, can just here the voice in Peters head and maybe flash back to the last movie?  Dont think we should add Cap Stacy back into car chase.
 
There is too much back and forth with Peter and Gwen  can we recut the Dim Sum scene so that it doesnt feel so repetitive of their break-up in the last movie  Can Peter be more honorable and definitive and less wishy-washy?
 
Why do we need a year to pass
 
Harry story feels like the main plot of the movie  Peter should look into the past b/c of Harry  maybe find some photos of them together as kidsuse obsession wall more to set up this part of his past not just what happened to parents.
 
Not sure what Peter learns at Roosevelt is entirely correct. Were distracted by the idea that Peter became Spider-Man b/c of his fathers blood --- all this special back story with his super-scientist dad fights with the idea that Peter is normal kid from Queens who becomes the greatest super-hero in the world
 
Andrews performance is all over the placea lot of crying and then a lot of mania. Hard to track him emotionally sometimes. It undermines his reaction to Gwens death b/c he gets upset and emotional a lot.
 
Dont like the idea that May tells Peter his parents were spies b/c two seconds later he finds out they are not and it again fights with the idea that hes an ordinary kid.
 
Like the idea that May finds out hes Spider-Man  finds his costume instead of just the rosemary harris wink-wink all the time.
 
Kind of like the morgue, but hate the dancing mortician  clich.
 
Are you using VFX to show how Electro is travelling from one point to another (bursts of electricity).
 
Need to underscore capture of goblinmore sirens as you linger on the clock 1;21, 1:22 am (nice touch).
 
Surveillance scene should be about following Harry not Peterno one should be following Peter.
 
Can Electro hum Itsy-Bitsy Spider before he plays it electronicallymaybe we can use this again.
 
Maybe intercut the ending montage and hearing Gwens speech with someone going into special projects and revealing more easter eggs and see that the rhino case has been broke into and the suit is missinggreat way to transition to rhino ending.
 
Dont need Aunt May in the kitchen.
 
Spider-man needs to feel more directly responsible for preventing the planes from crashing.
 
Dont show New Yorkers looting. </TEXT>
