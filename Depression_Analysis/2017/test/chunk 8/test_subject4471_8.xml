	<TEXT> To add to this anecdote, I used to work in telecomm, working on hydro (power in Canada) lines for the local power companies. While my own company is fairly small and was all guys, the power company was this monolithic public corporation, yet some of the supers were explaining to me they were having a hard time hiring anyone because (a) half of the population (women) never apply for anything but office jobs and (b) graduating college kids with engineering degrees don't want to work in some middle-of-nowhere city. 

These jobs pay a metric fuck ton with amazing benefits AND union support. You practically have an amazing job for life, yet no one wants to work on substations in Farmville Canada. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Gretchen  Elliott had far more impact on Walt than any other character in the show, except for maybe Jesse. Gretchen was Walt's ex-girlfriend and Elliott was his best friend in grad school, the man with whom he founded Grey Matter.

As we see in the show, Walt wants to earn everything himself - when Gretchen's rich family helps startup Grey Matter (presumably, but never explicitly mentioned), Walt becomes infuriated and leaves her. In his chaotic and moody state after leaving the love of his life, Walt gets hitched to some random diner waitress named Skyler, gets her pregnant almost immediately and then goes and buys some boring suburban house like everyone else. Walter then watches for 16 years while his ex-girlfriend marries his best friend, takes Walter's research and uses it with Gretchen's money to forge a billion-dollar pharma company that should have belonged to Walter. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well the writers are clearly inspired by Macbeth and Richard III, two of Shakespeare's plays. In Richard III, Richard monologues quite a bit with the audience in the first act, but as the play goes on, he does this less and less to make him less sympathetic to the audience. By the end of the play, he does not monologue and the audience can see how monstrous he has become. </TEXT>

Or you can do the more bold thing and straight ask her out: "Sorry, I have to go but I want to continue our talk over a drink sometime, maybe next week. Write your number down."

Never ask them for their numbers. Always tell them you want their number, then hand them your phone. I get rejected far less when my phone is already out and it's staring the girl in the face.

Never be scared of rejection. It happens to everyone. Shrug it off and move on. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You didn't ask for a date or anything - you're just making lame jokes for what end purpose? You need to be direct with women and stop beating around the bush. They will respect you for that and it will help outside of dating as well (e.g. in the work place).

As for your picture in the OP, I could say maybe get a haircut or something, but looks are nowhere as important to women as personality and self-confidence. But definitely lose the shag - I can see you with short sides and a bit of styling up top. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't think physical demons exist like we see them in comic books or Diablo 3, but are manifestations of bad ideas, thoughts, habits and activities. Like when someone did something bad they feel like they're "living with demons," when in fact it's just a sense of regret and foreboding.

When someone passes blame to a sort of intelligent evil mastermind behind everything bad, it does a discredit toward's humanity's own craftiness and tendency towards violence. Furthermore, why would God just let these little red-eyed devils run amok among his people if they have no redemption available to them? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Here's a trick: text them back while they're standing with you, using the excuse, "Here, let me send you my # too."

 So do I attempt to call her again?

No. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Something lighthearted and in public, considering it is a first date. Go take her to get coffee or hot cocoa, then walk around a park, go skating or something. 

NEVER go to the cinema on a first date. It's dark. You can't talk to them. It's really awkward and shit. Cinema dates are better later on - great for making out in the back. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  "Be selfish"

I really don't like this, but that's the Anglican in me speaking.. You can be confident, charming and intelligent without having to resort to being a selfish prick.

The first paragraph was good advice though. OP needs to stop complaining and actually put in the time if he wants some results. </TEXT>
