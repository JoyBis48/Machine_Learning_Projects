	<TEXT> Having links to seamlessR's channel would be a start, some links to forums and good free sample packs, create a /r/edmproduction essential pack with samples and patches for well known synths like harmor, sylenth1, serum and massive (probably missing afew) and linking to really well known tutorials for things like side chaining and stuff along those lines  and putting all of those in a beginner tab would really help out a lot of new producers. Having genre specific sections would also be great i.e. hard dance most popular plug-ins, kick tutorials, lead tutorials, sample packs things like that </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey guys! When I get into a new genre I like to go all out and buying a ton of tracks, are their any massive compilations out there or will I just have to buy a ton of EPs? Ok now for the second part of the title, I just haven't been listening to a lot of Hardstyle lately, I don't know why because I still love it, I guess I just got kinda bored :/, but know I want to get back into it, are their any recent releases I should check out?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey guys! I don't know how AMA's are organized on here but I do have afew sugestions: Headhunterz, he made the switch from hardstyle to house a bit ago so I think people would have some questions for him. Angerfist, he had his own festival last year and he released a pretty kick ass album to go along with it. Noisecontrollers, one of the biggest names in the hardstyle scene, he has an album coming out soon and I think it would be cool to ask him afew questions  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> music threads are a great way for a community to learn more about eachother and what better way then talking about music from a game where lolis in rediculious getup's shoot absurd amounts of bullets at eachother! (you have to admit that sounds pretty hype and we're all about hype here ;) ) Ok so here's how this will work 3 of your favorite types of arrangements (because choosing is hard) 2 of your favorite songs and let's say 5 of your favorite arrangements (for bonus points post your Touhou waifu and be juged by the scrublord army). I'll start (it doesn't just have to be electronic, want to post your favorite Celtic folk arrangement? go for it man!)   

Arrangement type: Schranz/Hardcore/Hardstyle

Songs: Reach for the moon imortal smoke and U.N. Owen was her?

Fave arrangements: [Reach The Speed by Round Wave Crusher](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7UVCxcW46Y), [Bad Apple by Shingo Dj](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eU5SQAOdvIU), [Rabies by moro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqOiGJA1nSM), [Trick Gang by Thanatos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFEspH5qt94), and finally [Vampire Majesty by pocotan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEhqj6b1DPQ)
