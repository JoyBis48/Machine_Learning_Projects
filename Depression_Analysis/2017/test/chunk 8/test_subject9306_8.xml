	<TEXT> Yeah, this is probably going to be an unpopular opinion but I'm getting tired of hearing about how introverts are all super special snowflakes that deserve vast amounts of love and care and attention. Especially in the description that extroverts 'take' energy while introverts 'give' it - funnily enough, we're actually people too, not vicious social predators. We also have specific needs and dislike being treated in certain ways. And we give far more energy than introverts - who makes a social event fun, the friendly, talkative person who wants to connect to people and bring them together, or the awkward person sitting silently in the corner trying not to "waste" his precious energy on people who are beneath him? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Musical theatre is a completely different art form to opera. It's much more accessible for someone who isn't a hardcore theatre fan, and the repertoire is considerably more well known by the public (e.g I Go To Rio from The Boy From Oz, *everyone* has heard that song)

OP, if you tell me what city you live in I can give you recommendations of productions.

EDIT: I might add that the timeframe in which something was composed is hardly an indication of its quality. I know hilarious and highly inappropriate operas with brilliant music, that can easily be compared in entertainment style to a modern comedy movie. Just because the accompaniment is a violin and not a guitar doesn't make it stuffy and awkward like most people seem to think.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> AFAIK Asperger's isn't something you treat. It's a mental 'disability' (I don't know if that's the proper term and I don't believe it really disables you, so take it with a grain of salt) on the autistic spectrum, which just means that his brain is wired a little differently to that of most 'normal' people. He will have trouble innately understanding a lot of social stuff and human interaction, particularly sarcasm and body language, and may have trouble empathising. As far as being passive or having no goals goes, I think that's something he will have to consciously work to defeat. There's no reason why he can't (but I'm far from an expert so do your research) but he needs to understand first that these are not really healthy traits when taken to that extreme.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Before we met, he had absolutely no goals whatsoever, no interests or hobbies other than watching TV and playing computer games. He would just go to work at a grocery store (where he still works 8 years later), come home and play games/watch TV until it was time to go to work again.

As someone who has had it since the age of 12, this is *not* the result of depression. Sure it can (and not always) affect your motivation and your ability to focus, but nowhere near to this extent. 

His mental illness is possibly contributing to some serious issues that he already has, not causing them. This guy (I'm sorry, but honestly) sounds like an apathetic loser, who is either using depression as a get-out-of-life-free card or is just completely unmotivated to do anything. There is no reason why he can't have goals and ambitions with depression.

EDIT: Or he has some other additional, possibly undiagnosed, mental illness. Is he medicated for depression at the moment, and if so, how heavily? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Reddit seems to be strongly biased against people with low self esteem, and loves to tell them to 'just respect yourself more.' Holy shit Sherlock, is that what I've been doing wrong all along? Especially when the esteem issue is medical and from a legitimate mental illness like depression, you can't just decide to like yourself overnight, and more importantly - *it's not their fault that they are depressed in the first place.*

It'a like telling someone with cancer to just harden up and get better already, and that if they die then they didn't try hard enough.  </TEXT>
