	<TEXT> There is no rational reason that someone can't make it to the polls, which are usually open for 12 hours on election day, if they wish to vote.

Does it take longer than 12 hours for Democrats to travel to their neighborhood polling center?

Can you show me one documented case of someone that couldn't make it to their *neighborhood* poll in less than 12 hours of travel? 

Get up early.

Vote on your lunch break.

Vote after work. 

Vote anytime if you don't work.

Some states actually require employers to give you time off to vote!  

There is absolutely no legitimate reason for early voting.
