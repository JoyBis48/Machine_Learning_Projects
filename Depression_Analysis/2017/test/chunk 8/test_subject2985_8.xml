	<TEXT> This is what I posted on Facebook:

Tomorrow is the 15/15/15 Moneybomb for Bernie. Join this Thunderclap to maximize its impact.

 One of his most impressive stats is that he's received 400,000 donations from 250,000 different people, averaging $33. To give that some perspective, Obama (who defeated Hillary last time) had 180,000 donors by this point in the 2008 cycle, and Hillary has gotten donations from 50,000 people, but has raised 3 times as much money. She has the 1%, Bernie has us, the 99%.
 
 So join this Thunderclap and let's drive those numbers up even higher to show everyone that Bernie is the candidate FOR the people, BY the people!

Feel free to steal use any of it if you think it'll help. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> From [the sub's rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/wiki/rulesandregs#wiki_do_not_create_your_own_title.):

Your headline must be comprised only of the copied and pasted headline of the article, a continuous quote taken from the article, or both the headline and a continuous quote taken from the article.

That's exactly what I've done.

Title:

Jesse Ventura: Bernie Sanders Has Got Momentum

Exact quote:

Hats off to Bernie Sanders. Ill help him anyway I can, although Im not quite as socialistic. Bernie believes in power to the people and the people controlling the government, and I believe in that also. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Sanders might just become some GOP-leaning voters' favorite 2016 Democrat -- and not just because he's giving Hillary Clinton a tough time. It's not hard to see some of his positions appealing to more libertarian voters like former Ron Paul fans who prefer Sanders over Rand Paul. </TITLE>

Police and firemen are the ones that I often reference. When you dial 911, it's not a corporation coming to save you. </TEXT>

My bad. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Get your friends to take a candidate compatibility test (like ISideWith.com). There are a lot of people out there who agree with Bernie that don't know it. Post the test that you like the best on Facebook, Twitter, etc., and help them realize that they do, in fact, Feel The Bern! </TITLE>

	<TEXT> I think many Sanders supporters have come to see the light by seeing just how aligned with Bernie their personal beliefs are, and these tests are a great way to show them that. I posted a link to [ISideWith.com](http://www.isidewith.com) on my Facebook wall today, and I think my friends were surprised to find out just how pro-Bernie they are.

Personally, I like ISideWith.com's test. I think it offers some really great resources and offers a very thorough set of answers across the political spectrum. But there are many out there, so post the one that you think is the best to the social media of your choice. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I actually think that if he wins the nomination, democratic turnout would skyrocket, which would be huge. The republicans are going to show up and vote for their guy, they always do (that's why the country is so much more liberal than the government, the left is underrepresented among actual voters). But if we give the left someone to get excited about, like Bernie, then I think they'll actually turn up and elect him. </TEXT>
