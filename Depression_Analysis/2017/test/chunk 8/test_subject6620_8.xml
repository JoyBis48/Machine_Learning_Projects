Then I went to a public high school were the following apparel/colors were banned: 
Baby Blue and Black, Yellow and Black, the color Pink, NY Yankees gear, Georgetown University gear, the number 22, and any random Mexican kids that security wanted to stop in the hallways. 

The punishment was going to the Dean's office and changing into these giant Pepsi t-shirts. I'm constantly baffled as to why neither school just made us get uniforms. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> YES! Sullivan needs to be way higher on this list!

[Legendary moment with Sullivan:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qye101BNhWE) 
People seem to forget that he scored two short-handed goals after getting hit with the puck. 

Also, I remember him having an epic game on St. Patty's day one night. His trade to Nashville was so infuriating; scores a hat-trick in his first game as a Pred and puts up 10 pts in 3 games.

Recently, I ran into the Edgewater Jewel early one morning and had a guy remark to me how cold it was. (He's parked next to me, so I happen to notice that he has the same make and model car; only his looks crappier) I thought it unusual that he needed to walk around my car to get to his, but wasn't suspicious. As I come out of the Jewel, lo and behold, I had a few center caps that just happened to be missing.   </TEXT>
