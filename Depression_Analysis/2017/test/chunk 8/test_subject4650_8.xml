	<TEXT> Absolutely. It's easy to ride and pleasant to get about on. You're not getting Yamaha reliability - but on the other hand if you don't mind getting the spanners out now and then to do minor tighten ups and check things over, it'll teach you more about maintaining your own machine than you'll learn on a Yamaha.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The one dunk I ever got in a game. It was a D-grade women's game and I was reffing. All alone on a fast break, this lady puts up a layup, and I can see the instant it leaves her hand exactly what's about to happen. It's going to sit pretty right in front of the rim.

I was obsessed with dunking. At 5"11 and white, this was not a healthy obsession. I used to jump off things to make it happen. I could jump straight up and hang on the rim with both hands, but was an inch or two short of being able to throw it down. It just burned me inside, I used to dream about dunking at night.

So when I saw that ball, something snapped inside me. I was already at full sprint, but I changed course to head for the basket instead of the baseline... One, two, launch... I caught the ball with one hand and jammed the fuck out of it, and roared like a mountain lion.

Then I had to blow the whistle and give somebody a sideball as they all looked at me in total shock. And to make things worse, one of their kids on the sideline started crying and saying "NO JORDANS, NO JORDANS."

Doesn't matter; got dunk. I never got another dunk in a game but I can now die happy. </TEXT>

It reads the revs on your engine and then transmits the sound of a huge V8 to your car stereo so it feels like you're driving a monster truck. 

But it relies on revs - to do this for an electric vehicle, you'd need to simulate the presence of gear changes. It would ruin the effect. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The Gigafactory is all about cost reduction. But every battery company on the planet reckons they've got something with twice the energy density on the bench due to better structures or chemistry. Obama threw 6 billion dollars at the industry a few years back and there's just a constant stream of new ideas coming through. I have a lot of faith that major breakthroughs will change the game in the next 5-10 years. I'd love to see a graph of battery improvement since the 1990s, ni-cad through to Li-po and beyond, I suspect you'd be surprised.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> He's right - full throttle at a standstill doesn't take off like a rocket. It's an immensely powerful and torquey motor locked in a very high gear. I suspect most gas superbikes would beat it to 40mph. But hit the gas at 60mph, like I was on the Skyline road, and there's *nothing* I've ridden that comes close. It's absolutely insane. And if I owned one I'd downgear it as far as is practical, because I ain't gonna be doing 218mph any time soon and I'd want that monster performance as accessible as possible. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Melbourne is one of the best places in Australia to ride a motorcycle. Nice wide lanes you can split down, and you can park your bike on most footpaths for awesome access to just about anything. So if you're at all interested in bikes, this is a beaut place to ride them. Sure as fuck shits on public transport.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's how basic traction control works when it has different levels you can select. Slide control is a bit more complex as I understand it. 

The latest and greatest bikes are starting to run inertial control units that can get very accurate readings of things like your lean angle, the pitch of the bike, g-loads and yaw. I believe slide control uses the lean angle and yaw readings to allow the bike to get a certain amount of sideways happening before it gently intervenes. 

I've only had one quick track session on it, and I was focusing on the active suspension out there, so I didn't play with that setting. But the electronics are just getting more and more amazing.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Melbourne, Australia. It's about to become legal here in a limited sense but has been tolerated add long as I remember. I split every chance I get and will change lanes if I can't get through. I'll fold in my mirrors if things get tight. I make sure I don't hold car drivers up, and they don't hold me up, that's my rule.  </TEXT>
