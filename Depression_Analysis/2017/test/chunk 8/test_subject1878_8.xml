	<TEXT> Nice spin, but as usual factually inaccurate (suggesting that *this* is what sets precedent for EPA to do cost-benefit, lol!)

I'll keep it nice and simple:

EPA was planning on taking costs into account at the next stage of the MATS development. SCOTUS says "Go ahead and do it now."

So this simply rearranges the timeline, doesn't invalidate the MATS and certainly doesn't change anything about CPP.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Did you mean CPP? 

Because like I just said, this [kicks out one of the legs of the CPP plaintiff's arguments](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-06-24/obama-may-win-by-losing-in-quirk-of-supreme-court-epa-review), that since coal plants are regulated under MATS they can't be under CPP. So unless you're seeing some  way for a new lawsuit because of the MATS ruling (which would be novel because IIRC the CPP already did the cost accounting that MATS didn't yet ) then I think you're mistaken.

If you did mean MATS, then it's still not accurate since this ruling just kicked the suit back down to the DC court to make the EPA consider costs now instead of later when designing the enforcement. Doesn't throw out the MATS rule, just says the EPA has to take costs into account. DC court may throw out the rule, but since it upheld the rule last time it's not likely to toss it now, but instead will probably just tell the EPA to go count costs, thereby just delaying enforcement.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Re: SCOTUS decision, you're confusing MATS with CPP. MATS ruling has no effect on CPP, except getting rid of one of the CPP critic's arguments (that emissions were already regulated under MATS so they couldn't be under the CPP.)  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's my paraphrasing of paragraphs 4-6:

"Yet, there is a marked lack of publicly available information and analysis which would help New Zealanders decide on the best course of action."

The government had hurried its consultation process on its a negotiating position in the United Nations Paris meeting on climate change in December last year, to a period less than four weeks.

The NZAS was concerned about the lack of publicly available information, as well as the minimal involvement of key New Zealand state-owned research institutes and universities. </TEXT>

So by shutting them out of the process, they were denied the ability to provide their scientific input, i.e. were gagged.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> ...why the exclusion of Title+Quote? Seems like if title is allowed, and quote is allowed, then the combination should be allowed. I feel like quotes without the context of a title aren't going to make sense, and submissions with the flashiest quote that may or may not represent the full article (as a title would) are going to proliferate. 

Which means that the mods will now have to subjectively decide if a quote is an accurate representation because the title is no longer there to provide an overview of the whole piece.  </TEXT>
