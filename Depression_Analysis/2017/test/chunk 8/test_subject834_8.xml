	<TEXT> The side effects of the drugs don't seem worth it anymore. I was such a zombie that didn't care if he lived or died. Someone could've came in my house and robbed me and I would've just sat there and watched. I'll obviously continue medication if I ever get symptoms again but for the time being, I feel much better without the meds. I've always thought that the medication should only be used short term for when psychosis props up (obviously some people need them all the time, but a lot of us dont). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There obviously isn't much studies around it just yet but there has been a bunch of personal exp that I've heard over at /r/schizophrenia that say that it helps with negative symptoms (the most damaging symptoms of schizophrenia). Antipsychotics right now, don't help at all with the negative symptoms and if they do its very, very minimal. So if CBD is an antipsychotic that can help negative symptoms then it would be an insane breakthrough for people like me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Advice from a non-schizophrenic is always welcome mainly because it helps me understand people that are "normal" a little bit better, and gives me a completely new perspective and ways of thinking about things I guess you could say, just like if I told a non-schizophrenic about my perspective then it could also change theirs (if that made any sense at all). 

I wouldn't say she reacted negatively but she reacted in a weird way, maybe passive-aggressive? I'm not sure. I think she likes but also hates that I can't empathize as well as others. I CAN empathize it's just weakened most of the time unless I've built a strong strong relationship with you which usually takes so long that people give up.

It's never really caused a full blown argument with anyone, they usually just stop speaking to me for a while (or I somehow stop speaking to them). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Okay, okay, so I know that I will never be cured of schizophrenia and I will most likely have a psychotic episode some time since I'm off of my medication but how long can it take for the psychotic symptoms to come back? I've been off of my medication and I don't feel too bad at all. Usually I would rapid relapse and become psychotic in under a month, but this time seems different. My psychiatrist is always fucking off, I'm seeing my psychologist though but I don't think they know too much about schizophrenia and the medicine. Also, the reason I came off of Seroquel is because it made my functioning a lot worse. </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2015-04-21 19:00:55 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Lately I've noticed that some of my ADHD symptoms have been coming back (I was predominantly inattentive), so I've been thinking about going back to my psychiatrist and asking if I can go back on medication for that also but the only problem is that the stimulant medication was the only meds that worked for me and as you know, stimulants can cause psychosis. Could I technically try the stimulants out again to see if they might work without causes psychosis or am I just putting my health at even more risk? I don't even know if she'll prescribe because of the schizophrenia, but it's causing problems with keeping attention on school stuff that I have to get back into.

Has anyone ever had experience with being on ADHD (stimulant) medication and having a mental illness like schizophrenia, or even bipolar? </TEXT>

Basically what I'm asking is, why isn't nausea considered a form of pain when in my experience it's a form of pain? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have schizophrenia and don't medicate anymore (around 2 months off). Medication wont prevent you from making your life go to the "metaphorical" shitter, it'll just be a helpful tool. Being off of medication also wont make your life go down the shitter either, I'm willing to bet you'll make it through, yes you life may be different in 6 months but that doesn't mean that it'll be worse. I had ADHD as well when I was a kid and a teenager, and was on ritalin most of my life and if I'm going to be honest, it sucked. The medication probably MADE my life go down the "shitter". As /u/jepyang said, people make it through this shit all the time and people make it through worse stuff as well, you'll get there, just go through the proper channels whenever you can. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Some people don't like opiates, simple as that. Even though they're the most addictive class of drugs on planet earth, not everyone likes them. Opiate nausea is pretty common before a tolerance builds, then once you've used for a while it kinda comes back (for me anyway, but I have an unknown stomach condition). The euphoria from opiates is different from other drugs, it's a warm, fuzzy feeling and a feeling that everything is just, fine (especially when nodding out). As I said though, not everyone likes them, there's been countless people on opioid painkillers before and never, ever got addicted (or even felt a buzz or liked the buzz) and then there's people out there that gets addicted to them and loves the high.

Maybe you're someone that just doesn't like opiates... Just because they're extremely addictive doesn't mean that everyone loves the feeling, consider it a blessing. </TEXT>

I can go to the shop (about 2-5 mins walking distance) and see around 2-3 heroin addicts every time and those are just the ones that are really bad because they've been addicts for decades. Pills on the other hand are probably slightly bigger but definitely nothing like the US, I can find some oxy here and there but mainly the pills consist of prescription stimulants (mainly ritalin), benzodiazepines (namely, valium and temazepam)... Prescription opiates aren't all that big on the streets, because after all, why do we need prescription opiates if we have a shit ton of heroin? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It depends on where you look but they are fentanyl analogues. For example, carfentanil which is tens of thousands more potent than morphine while heroin is only around 5x more potent, but that's pretty much unusable without overdosing. Fentanyl is also stronger than heroin and is around 100x(ish) more potent than morphine. Ohmefentanyl is also a lot stronger at around 6000x (can reach up to 18000x) more potent than morphine. 3-methylfentanyl is also a lot more potent. But if I was to say what was the most potent I would go with either carfentanil, dihydroetorphine or maybe even ohmefentanyl but these opioids cannot be used in humans because they are that potent, for example, carfentanil is active at around 1ug.

Btw, the way you measure opiate potency is by looking at how more potent it is than morphine. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Opiate withdrawal will make you feel lethargic/tired but you won't be able to sleep (or if you can, it'll be minimal and low quality). You should expect mild normal opiate withdrawal (since you're tapering) but you should also expect SNRI-like withdrawal because of the tramadol, most common of these symptoms is brain zapping. Also, ask your doctor (if you can) about clonidine, that can be helpful when you're having uncomfortable symptoms, good luck.

	<TEXT> I'm usually better at social interaction over the internet or through text as well, but if I know a person irl and I'm speaking to them over text and they start getting emotional, I still don't know how to deal with that or show that I care. Sometimes, I simply don't FEEL like I care but I know in my own thoughts that I care, if that makes any sense? My social interactions no matter what are never really smooth mainly because the things I say don't make sense a lot of the time (especially in person but even through text my words will sometimes still get jumbled and I'll still be at a lose of words 90% of the time).

I've always been kinda cold, distant and detached even before my first psychotic break. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Just another post by me, basically writing to myself but also to the sub reddit, like usual. Anyway, I've recently been speaking to someone I was very close to and she's started opening up to me and stuff but the thing is, I have 0 idea how to react to the stuff she says. Like, she'll tell me something really emotional and I'll seem cold and distant, maybe I am cold and distant but I want to try and seem like I'm not, if that makes any sense? It's like when she tells me something really emotional I just won't know how to react to it, hell, I don't even know how to react to stuff that isn't deep and emotional, I just usually send funny pictures to people and joke around that's pretty much the extent of my social skills. I really want to change that but I don't know how. 

Does anyone else have experience with this? I know a lot of you probably don't have a lot of social contact (like me, except two people I know in real life and 2-3 people over the internet), but maybe some of you can either relate or help me? Thank you.

Also, this is a progression (or what feels like a progression). As in, it's been getting worse and worse for about a year. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I've been doing some reading about why schizophrenia is so prevalent in modern society even though it seems useless and I've came across a few articles that suggest that schizophrenia may actually be favoured on an evolutionary basis for some odd reason. Some articles suggested that maybe its been favoured because maybe schizophrenics were/are the ones that draw and separate people from the herd (crowd) and allow humans to be more diverse in their thinking, rather than just mindlessly following everyone else. It seems like a good explanation why schizophrenia is so prevalent even though it has great social and human cost. 

I hope this doesn't sound either too confusing or insanely stupid, but what do you think about this? I can link the articles if people ask. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Like others have said, you can't force anything. You'll have to wait until he's ready, I've lived with two alcoholic parents and I know all too well that forcing someone into treatment is just a disaster waiting to happen, they won't only resent you but they'll relapse over and over and over. My dad has been in and out of treatment for alcoholism for a little over ten years and the longest he's been sober is around a year, now there's not much hope for him. Just be there when he's ready to get help, don't shun him and don't ever turn him away, once he goes through withdrawal (cold turkey, which isn't sustainable btw, users always go back either before the WD is fully complete or after, they need a maintenance) a few times he'll wonder what he's doing and then he'll truly want help.

Also, you can also try /r/Opiates (even though it's full of addicts posting pics, they can be helpful) and /r/OpiatesRecovery

Good luck! </TEXT>
