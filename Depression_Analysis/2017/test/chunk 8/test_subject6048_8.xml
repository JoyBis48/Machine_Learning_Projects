	<TEXT> Appreciate such a comprehensive response!

You are correct in identifying them as Stafford loans(4/6 of them are anyway).

To your questions:

1) I do not have an emergency savings. I just started building it up a couple weeks ago, opened a savings account and designated auto-deposits. 

2) About 5% of my monthly income.

3) Stable as it can get. Catastrophe a la financial crisis is really the only scenario I see losing it, but let's be honest that could happen at any moment these days.

Sounds like the best strategy is to allocate all of my extra $ (my  goal is for 50% of monthly income) towards emergency fund and loan payoff. Having the mindset of paying off the loans being the equivalent of a 6.8% ROI is the best way for me to rationalize it.

Thanks! </TEXT>

Obviously if you have any heart/respiratory issues you shouldn't take it, but this could easily give you the edge that puts you into passing.

EDIT: Keep in mind a lot of these practice exams are by design more difficult than the actual test. Don't let your scoring on these affect your confidence. There's a good chance you're actually just as prepared as you need to be. Don't give up! </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Should I be investing savings into ETFs/Mutual Funds or paying off my student loans? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-07-09 14:48:46 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I have about ~$14,000 left to pay in student loans. The interest rates on these vary from 5.35% - 6.8%. 

I'm anxious to put money into investments and save, but obviously I see the benefit in just paying these off. Do these rates seem particularly high/low to those with experience?

Thanks </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Worth it to start with Betterment before moving to Vanguard? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-07-07 23:15:16 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm just starting to allocate funds to savings, so I'm only starting with a few hundred $ at the moment. My plan is to stick with Betterment for a few months, once I reach $3,000(the minimum for most Vanguard accounts) I'll transfer it over to them.

I've heard people complain about the Betterment fees, but honestly an annual .35% charge over a 3-4 month period doesn't bother me.

Is this smart? Should I just be keeping it in a Savings account until I hit the 3k?

Obligatory thanks for the people in this community. I've had questions before and the responses are always super helpful. This sub is one of the main reasons I've wisen'd up and started to manage my finances seriously. </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2015-06-18 16:47:20 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm a big ol' investing noob. I bought 60 shares of a stock NKA at around $2 back in February. My intention was just to hold, and monitor the stock as more of a learning experience(I couldn't motivate myself to really follow any stocks unless I had money invested). Anyway, it was recently announced that NKA is going to be purchased, with shareholders receiving a little over $4 in cash for each share. The price skyrocketed to about $3.75 when this was announced. My inclination is to just wait for this buy-out to happen and take then $4 a share. However, what if something goes wrong in the purchase? Should I just take the profits I have now and sell all my shares at 3.75?

Wanted to see what some members of this community would do if they were in my position.

P.S. This subreddit is awesome. I've learned so much just by reading through the comments section and following discussions. </TEXT>
