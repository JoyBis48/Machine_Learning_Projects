	<TEXT> Right, back in the day say the 90s, it really was a boom in paranormal on TV

I'm from the UK so the best we had was Strange But True, check out this archive...

https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7D63E9D27340FF44

Then the US had various shows from Sightings to Unsolved Mysteries with Robert Stack

There were other themed shows like Outer Limits but not factual reconstruction TV shows

I would love to see the complete Robert Stack Unsolved Mysteries episodes but you can't stream any online thanks to the guys that own the modern inferior version hosted by Dennis Farina which changed the theme tune and gave it a very boring studio feel with non of the charm Robert Stack gave </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Bruce Lee should have played some sort of super hero and had his own show

Instead he was sidekick to some douche and had to fight an inferior Burt Ward

Rumour is he didn't want to lose so they made him and Robin tie, way to go lol

Bruce would have kicked the hell out of Batman and the rest of the cast for sure

Bruce used martial arts to beat his opponents, Batman uses those wonderful toys </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am still on Windows 7 so am awaiting 10 very soon but will WMP be available in Win10 as know Microsoft have killed Media Centre so what of Media Player?

Seen they're having standalone apps for these tasks so is there a need for WMP, I have used it for years to transfer files to music device but version 12 hadn't really changed from XP and still had outdated options, codecs and functionality, it could have been so much more 

They should have merged Media Centre with WMP and tied in massive downloads services like iTunes, think then Microsoft would've stayed relevant instead of getting lagged behind for many years  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Can anyone list the available file formats Windows 10 will support when released?

I mean various formats from codecs / audio / video / image / office / PDF / zip files

Heard 10 will offer wider audio and video format playback as well as image viewing </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Also, after the year, a physical version will still work while downloading after the year will be a paid upgrade so having a few physical copies dotted around is a good fail safe plus installing from physical media is a lot quicker than having to download the thing which could take overnight for some people </TEXT>
