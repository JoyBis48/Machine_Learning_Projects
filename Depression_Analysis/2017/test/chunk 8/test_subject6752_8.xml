	<TEXT> Your second analogy is actually great. Questioning can feel a lot like not knowing who you are and being wrong about it. That's why, when a person finally comes to a real conclusion, it's better safe than sorry. They won't be offended by you trying to hard to accept them, but may be hurt by you seemingly not trying have enough. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You're putting words in my mouth. That's not even close to what I said. She earned the medals while presenting as a man and being male. I don't know the rules for trans* Olympians, since I'm not the least bit interested in the Olympics. In my opinion, people should participate with the gender they present and/or identify as, regardless of sex, and if that changes in the future that has no bearing on the accomplishments, but I don't make the rules. 

Since you are clearly looking for a fight, please go TERF elsewhere. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In typical babydyke fashion, we talked about marriage from about 2 weeks in. It was always an inevitable. There was never a huge proposal in a super immediate way. On our nerd anniversary dating I gave her a ring in Texas Road house and asked her to marry me at some point. However, setting a date was done by us sitting in a college sociology class and me realizing that her father's income took her out of financial aid. I wrote her a note explaining such and we talked to my parents (who we live with) and got their okay. We talked to her mom the next day.  </TEXT>

My brother is constantly calling my car a go kart and just a general dick about how much better he is than me. It really hurts me and I really hate it. He is completely irrational and talking to him about t would do nothing.

TL;DR my brother is a dick. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I am a 20 year old woman. I last shaved my legs the night before my wedding, which was December 10th. I last saved my armpits roughly one month ago. I last shaved my pubic hair sometime in January, I think. 

I'm a small part Native American, and it presents in low body hair and reddish toned skin. My legs don't really appear hairy, as what there is is blonde and thin. My armpits have enough growth to feel the breeze from the fan if I'm shirtless. 

I absolutely love it. I feel sexy with more body hair. I feel more myself, not working so hard to remove what is naturally growing. I bathe regularly and wear deodorant, so smell isn't an issue. Not shaving makes me feel at home in my body. 

My wife loves that I'm more confident. She loves that I like my body more. She also knows that, if she asks, I will remove all of it for her. 

I wear shorts and don't care, though I don't quite have the confidence for tanks right now. 

My sisters in law are all 14 and 15. They are all super feminine and don't get why I'm comfortable this way. I don't need them to get it. I need me to be happy, and this helps me be happy. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It seems like I went through webMD and picked symptoms. 

I have irrational, uncontrollable anger that I can't handle well in many situations. I'm very emotionally unstable; I can go from ecstatic to livid like the flip of a switch, and I handle neither particularly well. I have really bad abandonment issues for no apparent reason and it manifests in my testing relationships and generally being an asshole to make sure people don't abandon me. I nearly always feel empty; the only time I don't is during extremely special happy events and when I drink. I make a conscious effort to control my drinking and drink less than once a month, and I'm a lightweight so literally two Smirnoff ice and I'm drunk. I drive and spend rather recklessly and I find myself dissociating and unable to really change my off the wall actions. I also have a history with self harm.

I've read that BPD is often hard to diagnose because people with it don't want to be criticized so they won't mention shitty things they do. Because of that, I feel like a fraud, like if I really had it I couldn't be this self critical. I've had some of these symptoms for a long time, but stuff like the dissociating is very recent, like within the last year. The only stable relationships I have are with my wife and my mother. I go through "friends" like water and I admittedly am a terrible judge of character so I pick them poorly. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My mom is my best friend. She supports transpeople, just not me transitioning. She fostered over 50 children, partly because she was infertile. Almost all of those children were boys. She wanted a daughter so bad. When she got pregnant with me, she was 38. She says she knew immediately that God wouldn't make her wait 16 years for a sick boy and that I was a healthy girl. She had my brother two years later; my older brothers were adopted before me. 

When I came out as gay, she struggled with it. That didn't last long, but at that time she made it clear that I could "transition ten years after (she) was dead." She reiterates that periodically as well. When I started keeping my hair short, she struggled, but I tease her and tell her that I brought home my high femme wife so I'm no longer obligated to be femme. 

In 2012, she ended up in the ICU for 11 days and almost died because of a whole host of medical issues we didn't know existed. We worked on them for two and a half years before learning that she has non alcohol related cirrhosis. She remained sober her whole life (her father was a drunk) so that she could avoid that exact problem. If you didn't know, there is no treatment or cure for cirrhosis. 

I don't get very many more years with my mom. I know that for sure. It's in the early stages, but it sometimes progresses very quickly. I don't want to waste what little time I have making her view me as a man when I know that is the last thing she wants to do. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I (20 AFAB) identify as genderqueer and transmasculine. I have done nothing to transition, medically or socially, because I don't want to risk my family for it. My mom got three sons and me and has made it clear that she will not support transition. Recently I've started to realize that I have a lot of symptoms of Borderline Personality Disorder. One of the symptoms is inconsistent identity. I bounce around from full male to almost female identity all the time, but it doesn't feel the way genderfluid is often described; it's harsh and difficult and hurtful and confusing, not fluid at all. I also have depression and anxiety. I was reading the post about dysphoria and it's effects on you without you knowing and I was just wondering if this could be at all self inflicted. I know you guys and gals aren't trained mental health counselors but if you know anything, please share. I'm sorry if this sounds crazy or in any way transphobic, I don't mean for it to. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think you're leaving something out. You come off a bit misogynistic, or at least completely oblivious, for other reasons. 

I am very high libido married to someone very low libido. She was low libido before we got married, but it got worse after. It isn't that she doesn't want to fuck me. She truly just can't get there. She can't force herself to be in the right head space. She also leads me on quite a bit. She'll spend a day promising me and sending me dirty texts and at night she just can't get there. Its not that she intentionally lied, she just isn't there, and that isn't her fault. 

You aren't wrong for wanting compatibility, but it seems like you never really tried to have a heart to heart with this girl about this. Her explanation sounds like she was raised to believe that sex is for marriage, and she feels shame for having it before. It's a really destructive mentality that causes a lot of issues. It sounds a lot like you got an answer you didn't like and didn't want to work on the issue.

For a lot of people, security and love are needed to feel comfortable to have sex. If she was asking you to listen more, she wasn't feeling enough of those things to be comfortable. 

You were a bit of an asshole in telling her that was the reason. You took something out of her control that you knew was an issue early on and threw it at her. Her libido is something she can't change. The only reason to give a reason when breaking up is so the person can work on themselves for their next relationship. All you did was make what already seemed to be a big insecurity worse. I think She dodged the bullet. </TEXT>

I used to be friends with this guy. One night, I'm driving him home cause we had been hanging out. We are all just chatting when he says to my wife and I, "Do you think Canada wants to kill us since we share such a big border with them?" I flipped out explaining to him why he was a goddamn moron. 

I worked for 18 months as a companion to a man with Down syndrome. It was mostly to help me build my resume as I'm a social work major looking into mental health, and it's related enough. The same guy as the Canada situation **tagged me** on Facebook in a picture of a cat with "Down syndrome". In fact, the cat was missing a facial bone and I explained why that was impossible and why saying it had DS was insensitive and actually extremely offensive. He said that people would do their own research and that he wasn't taking it down because he wasn't offending anybody. 

I no longer associate with that individual. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm basing that opinion on the men that I know, not any real evidence. You are beyond free to disagree. 

I subscribe MFA because I love the community and a lot of the stuff they post is great. I can't actually afford anything they recommend but it gives me an idea of what looks good and what to pair it with. There is also /r/lesbianfashionadvice and /r/boifashionadvice, which I mod but it's like totally dead air. </TEXT>
