	<TEXT> Murder is the deliberate taking of life without justification.

A Canadian can kill another person and be justified under the law in having done so.

Killing is certainly a better fit, as we do not yet know if the shooting was justified or not. </TEXT>

Bizarre.

	<TEXT> Murder? Based upon what?

Do you have access to all of the evidence and witness statements?

I've the distinct impression you've made up your mind, despite not having access to the totality of the evidence. </TEXT>

We need to win this election and handing our opponents ammunition is unwise, when you consider how fickle undecided voters are. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The NDP **will never** hold office unless they shed their socialist, big government  spending  roots.

I am a member and regular donor to the NDP and am both pleasantly surprised and thrilled at the direction our future PM is taking the party.

If you want to win, you must campaign from the centre, as you will lure both centre right and centre left undecided voters that are necessary for a win.

Do you want change or do you want more Harper?

If you want change, follow Mulcairs lead.

Edit - For my party, the fringe left ( which is in abundance on/r/Canada) does as much harm to it, as the fringe right does to Harpers brand.

I know, the truth hurts.  If I wanted to turn an undecided voter off my party, I'd sent her to /r/Canada. </TEXT>
