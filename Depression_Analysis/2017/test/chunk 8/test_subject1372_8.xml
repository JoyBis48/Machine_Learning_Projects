	<TEXT> As long as RNG is used properly, there's nothing wrong with g with it. "What direction should this random chicken go? RNG says 8, so northwest. Now where should it go?" And so on.

But crap like "should I totally miss this enemy again? RNG says 1, so yes. And it keeps saying 1."

And crap like "yeah, your enemy is totally gonna do his almost undodgeable move 3 seconds in instead of 60 seconds in."

There's a right and wrong time for RNG a, and it should always be balanced slightly in the player's favor if it's going to randomly effect difficulty. But, it should never affect if something is winnable. Tester totter around a difficulty level, but not randomly have some shit be really easy and some shot be absurdly difficult.

Candy Crush does it all fucking wrong, AND THEY DO THAT ON PURPOSE. Some people get stuck on level 1. Some on level 14. Some on 212. While some players just breeze past those and get stuck on levels 34 or 56 instead. Who cares? It's random. And King evil-company bitches want you to pay up every time the game randomly sticks you on a level.

Ocarina of time uses the RNG to determine the direction of chickens and Bug's movements. It never makes a chicken impossible to pick up. It never makes a bug go in a random direction when it should go into a patch of soil.

In Majora's Mask (another Zelda game for those who don't know), some bushes drop items or rupees based on RNG. But rupees are never hard to find when you need them. Neither are bombs or arrows or hearts. Especially because some bushes and pots, mostly around soaring points, have definite drops. That's important because when you reset time you lose it all and have to soar right to one of those points. So it's a good thing those points won't screw you over by somehow not dropping what you need. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Are you kidding? I live that I have so much trouble against Zelda. It's a much different challenge than simply trying to play around a faster character. Zelda is extremely unique in that she has the strongest toolset for a control playstyle. Some other characters have defensive play styles. If everyone was just extremely fast and aggressive, the game wouldn't be so awesomely diverse. It may have well been all Fox final D no items mod.

I feel like everybody complains about slower charavters because it makes the game seem slower. But I don't want everyone to play like a super fast power-house of combos. That seems to be the point of all other fighting games, but not Smash which is more about fast thinking on your feet. Speed Chess if you will. Not to say slower characters don't have the potential to be a part of that game, they can be. But just because your character moves a little faster, doesn't make them superior or better to play. And just because a character is slower doesn't mean they're less fun or inherently defensive and annoying. 

Bowser love to tank through everything, soo being damage through reading and calling out your opponent on their next move. NEWS FLASH, that's how high level smash is played. Fast or slow, general neutral game is about calling out your opponent and conditions g them to do what you want them to do. Converting later into combos and KOs is how the game is won. The best players are the ones who consistently turn a proper neural game into that all important KO. It's why I suck. I hit plenty, but getting a KO I rarely get against higher skilled players.

If you think Zelda is unfun to play against, play against more Zelda players and learn Zelda's common strats and meta game. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The problems I've had with Reddit apps lie within the things we do most often that Reddit apps don't get. Some of them don't let us edit apps, other apps maybe don't actually mark any messages as "read". Some apps don't let me check mod messages or submit text posts. Some of their UIs suck despite being as good as they can be on such a small screen. And I've even encountered apps that don't even let you browse an individual subreddit. I've even seen apps where I can't sort comments by new instead of best. And basically all apps suck if you're a mod of any subreddit and you're trying to mod on mobile. Not to mention, on most of them I've encountered, you can't even see the sidebar. That's important for a lot of subreddits.

Personally, I can't stand any of these apps. None of them offer everything necessary for an avid Reddit browser. I don't use any of them. I actually browse Reddit on the Safari mobile app. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I can agree. It's sometimes fun seeing the pathetic bot users who have an absurd amount of channels they follow because they're following a lot of bots and spam that's giving them lots of fake followers. Bots and spam that follow me get reported and blocked because I'd rather have 100 real followers than 1,000 fake ones.

Not to mention, channels like "Best Vines" and "Best Voiceovers" that blatantly steal vines and parts of YouTube videos and never offer any credit. It's best to report these as fake accounts and block them. Same for the channels that try to steal other channels by using the same name and profile image on vine.

And of course, just like Myspace and Facebook before it, *EVERYBODY* is going to look at the number of followers or friends they have as a means of popularity and/or self-worth. It's a horrible mentality. I look at the number of followers I have to see if I'm putting out good content. 107 followers is pretty good for the average user. And hey, if a few of them unfollow me because I didn't follow back, then fuck them.

Don't look at vine as another place of social media. It's actually not that social, and you definitely will run into that group of channels that seem to know each other. And don't be afraid to unfollow anybody when their posts stop being like their old posts. I prefer to follow funny viners, so if someone stops being funny to me, I'm definitely going to stop following them. Yeah, I've been disappointed by looking up "funniest" viners lists and seeing the same viners over and over. The worst part is, some of them aren't even funny, but make jokes toward a niche community.

I wish I could find 20 more people worthy of following, but as it stands right now, I can't find many other pages I want to follow. Meanwhile, I'll continue to post a vine almost every day. I edit all my vines, and I love video editing, so I'm glad I've found a place that will let me do something small for what I love every day. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You're very welcome. I've been using this method for quite a while and have had to figure out what works and what doesn't. As far as I'm concerned, Loader GX and Wii Flow simply don't work.

Don't forget, with updates, you'll need to once again make sure that SD:\usbloader\codes\ has the updated codes file. Using old codes files can cause glitches and crashes. (I unfortunately discovered that from accidentally playing 3.0 with 2.6b's codes.)

Any other problems, just ask. I'm very glad I could help. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Use Configurable USB loader. Before you even start your Wii, open your ad card on the computer. In SD:\codes\ you will see a file called rsbe01.gct. Copy this to SD:\usbloader\codes\.

Now go launch CFG on your Wii. Go to Brawl, but don't launch it yet. Go to the settings. Set "Ocarina" to on and set the hook type to "AXNextFrame".

Save your settings and launch the game. It should boot up directly into Project M. </TEXT>
