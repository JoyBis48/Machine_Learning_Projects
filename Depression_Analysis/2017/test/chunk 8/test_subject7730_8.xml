	<TEXT> Only problem I see with this clarification, great job on that btw, is that Blacks are not the only ones not getting their 'food'. Let's not pretend for one second that only black minorities are the only victims in society. 'All lives matter' to me means that, sure blacks are at a disadvantage to a certain extent but so are muslims (who probably have it worse in the USA), sikhs, Latinos, and any other minority that don't even have prominent leaders within the culture or the ability to come together and address problems they face in society. They all get swept under the rug which I can't stand to see. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I wouldn't say I'm religious per-say, but I do believe there is a 'God' (physical being or not) in some form or fashion. Isn't it crazy that we as humans, planets, and universe exist. I mean the universe had to have spawned from something, right? (God or Big Bang) But, how did that something come into existence for it create the universe? and it just becomes a vicious cycle that is impossible to fathom. We are something from nothing...literally, which defies any and all laws of this world that I know of. Truly, mind-blasting that a relatively new-born species can even have the cognitive ability to recognize or contemplate it's own world's creation and stem away from the programmed 'Eat, Survive, Procreate' that all animals have. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would explain myself but I was traumatized after watching it and have since forgot the premise but I do remember thinking that the story was either poorly put together or non-existent. Never felt anyone was in real danger. Hell, I don't even remember who the villian was, so that should say something in itself. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> "Red Eye" by Big KRIT gives me chills and I've never been in a tough relationship like that. It takes REAL artistry to make me feel like I've experienced what the artist has. And the way he tell the story of this situation while rhyming and staying on beat is amazing. Not to mention that the instrumental, especially the piano backbone is so powerful even on its own. </TEXT>
