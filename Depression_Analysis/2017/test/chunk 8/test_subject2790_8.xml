	<TEXT> No problem, I'm getting jealous at all the options you have in the US. In the UK only a humanist celebrant, registrar or priest can marry you as far as I know.

I found [a link](http://humanist-society.org) to the Humanist Society in America, hopefully there's a celebrant in your area which gives you another option. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As a fellow bride with a strained relationship with my father - he won't even be coming to the wedding - I can see where your concern is coming from and massive Internet hugs to you.

Would a possible compromise be, as someone else suggested I'm sure, having your DJ play a song dedicated to your FH and FMIL but have the dance floor open to everyone? This would allow them to have their dance to a song of their choosing without the implications of a spotlight dance. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> UK here, we're hoping to have a humanist celebrant marry us. We have to become a member of the humanist society for 2 years prior to the wedding  (they offer a package for engaged couples). Humanist ceremonies are much more personal than a traditional registrar and as FH and I are both atheists and marrying in an observatory it felt fitting.

[Here's a link to their website](http://www.humanism-scotland.org.uk) </TEXT>
