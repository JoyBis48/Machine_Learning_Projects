	<TEXT> thanks for giving me the same cliched answers everyone else has. i appreciate your trying to help but telling me 'it will get better' doesn't fucking help. it doesn't get better for everyone, so unless you have a crystal ball i don't want empty meaningless reassurances, sorry but I'm so fucking sick of the bullshit lines you've just fed me.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm just doing what the doctors have told me to do, I'm doing everything right and its really upsetting me, thats the problem all I'm plagued with now are the good memories from our relationship thats the only feeling of being content i have had so I'm constantly plagued and poisoned with thoughts of her, they tell me there called ruminating thoughts from the anxiety. its a fucking poison and all my ambitions and hope for my life, writing something that changes the world, hearing a girl say she loves me, being happy and okay with myself, not needing approval from everyone else. it all just seems like vein pipe dreams people keep telling me i'll be happy one day. well for some people it doesn't get better what if its like this for 10 years, fuck that.i don't want a life of mediocrity i'd rather die </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Have depression and anxiety i've had it since i was 16-17 (I'm 21 now), i only started doing something about it in december because this is all i know so i didnt think anything was wrong, i thought everyone felt like this because i had no feeling of contentness to compare it too. got into a relationship and i still felt the same although i had some superficial happiness, i thought something must be wrong, got broken up with two days after christmas out of the blue after spending christmas with her family, my family was on holiday so i was left alone broken up with for the rest of the holidays. she lives next door and had the same circle of friends so i still had to see her everyday (i felt like this way before her so this isn't a my girlfriend broke up with me I'm so sad story) i started with counselling and medication to combat this depression started exersiing more and tried everything in the book, eventually to suicidal and tried hanging myself a bunch of time, got sent into a mental hospital for a week, got kicked out of my university house and banned from talking to all my "friends" and ex because of my 'behaviour' by which they mean my depression. now I'm left alone in a flat still suicidal, toy with the idea of killing myself every day, last night i spent 5 hours standing on a train platform trying to be brave enough to do it. 

this is the edited version maybe one day i'll write a directors cut.  </TEXT>
