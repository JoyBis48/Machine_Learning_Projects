	<TEXT> Judging from my own experience, I'd say classical music (in the widest sense of the word) would gain a bigger audience if the performers and promoters started presenting more 20/21st century pieces.  For listeners coming from a jazz or rock background, I think Stravinsky, Glass, Shostakovich, Whitacre or (insert your favorite modern or  contemporary composer here) are much more readily accessible than music from the Classical and Romantic Eras.

	<TEXT> The [most authoritative study](http://www.bloomberg.com/bw/articles/2014-04-17/kansas-governor-brownbacks-lab-for-steep-tax-and-budget-cuts) of the effect of these measures is a January report by the Kansas Legislative Research Department, a nonpartisan arm of the legislature. It found that revenue isnt keeping up with expenses even after cuts in spending on K-12 schools, colleges, libraries, local health departments, courts, and welfare. If nothing changed, the research departments numbers show, the states general fund would have a shortfall of about $900 million by fiscal year 2019, or 14 percent of expenses that year. The states constitution requires a balanced budget, so either taxes will have to go back up or spending will have to come down even more. **The tax cuts dont pay for themselves,** says Duane Goossen, who served as state budget director under both Republican and Democratic governors. **That just is not happening.**

But I doubt any number will rattle the true believers.  Tax cuts are always good, and any contrary evidence is denigrated or ignored. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Like Sara Palin, Walker plays the politics of resentment quite well. Wisconsin's biggest economic problems center around the still shrinking manufacturing economy, but Walker's managed to convince part of the electorate that Wisconsin's problems are the over-educated liberals, overpaid civil servants and welfare recipients.  Meanwhile he's greatly reduced public services, ended many employment protections, and has ground down Wisconsin's education system, which was one the finest in the country.  He wants to makeover Wisconsin into the low wage model, typically found in the reddest states. I see the strategy he's using, but why people keep falling for it, I wish I understood.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Wisconsin has two electorates, one that only shows up in Presidential election years and one that shows up for every election. In Presidential election years, Wisconsin elects senators like Tammy Baldwin and Russ Feingold, and almost always votes for the Democratic Presidential candidate (albeit sometimes by very thin margins).  In off year elections, when the voting population skews older, Wisconsin elects conservatives like Walker and Ron Johnson.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This comment from Temuzjin summed it up pretty well

To create jobs, you generally need supply of goods and demand for goods.
A rich entrepreneur who hires people to make goods helps with the supply side. These are commonly called "job creators."
However, you could just as easily call a guy who buys a loaf of bread (or another good) a "job creator" because he or she helps with the demand side. Without demand, jobs that supply goods soon become unprofitable, which means that those jobs vanish. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Telling us they're the 'job creators' was another pretty good one. People have been falling for that one for decades.

Edit: I don't think I've ever posted anything on Reddit that recieved this many responses, 
(some of them quite good). So, while I have your attention, please let me elaborate a little:

Take your investment capital and try to run a successful job-creating business in a place that lacks.

- a government that enforces contracts

- a government that protects you against physical assault and fraud.

- Government services (Take your brilliant idea for a business and open it a place with crappy roads
and no public transportation.  Or for a real challenge, a place with no public water and sewer.)

- competent employees (who in America, have usually been educated at public expense)

- or most importantly, customers with money to spend

Sure investment capital plays a role in creating jobs and wealth.  But it's not the whole game.  The conservatives have exaggerated the role capital plays in the economy, and used it as a reason to justify low taxes or public giveaways to business, to reduce the rights and protections of employees, and policies that reduce labor's share 
of the [national income](http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/09/why-labors-share-of-income-is-falling/l).  </TEXT>
