	<TEXT> True we don't lack talent.  
The problem is freshers aren't being recruited or are not giving any form of training after getting out of an engineering college.   
Without that skill the talent is wasted and you have a massive unemployment.  
Big firms want people with experience and where do you get experience from the new talent pool or without any training?  
Small firms also want people with experience because they need a solid direction and skills to survive.   
Hope things get better.    </TEXT>

[Elemetary OS](http://elementary.io/) has done a major major job on polishing Linux for the mainstream - they still need work on the marketing though  
KDE 5 is still with the Shiny shiny graphics(I love it) but i've moved onto GNOME3(which is more flat in look and switching between apps fast is just out-of-the-world)  
There are still polishing touches required in GNOME3 but i can live and work with it without any problems.

I still stick with [Fedora](https://getfedora.org/) because it suits be well and has everything latest.  
Ubuntu and Debain are pretty good in terms of usability and stability(Debian is KING)   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For me it all 'just works' works now.   
My initial install only involves partitioning and hitting next-next-next on the installer screen.  
Its really a breeze these days.  
Graphic card is the only addition work I do.(windows also requires nvidia drivers)   
Since nvidia is going for optimus(Hybrid cards) i use the bumblebee package; for other nvidia cards a package from RPM fusion is all it needs.  
Fedora 22 pretty much identified everything on its own wifi, camera etc. Hell even my wacom tablet works - plug and play style.  

The other fine tuning i do which isn't system level stuff is install vlc, freetype-freeworld(for MacOS like font rendering) and apps like MyPaint, Krita, GIMP and Inkscape for drawing and Blender for 3D.   
Have VirtualBox also incase i need a Win environment within Linux for testing and Wine for some stupid windows only apps(which i rarely use these days)  

Have another system with Ubuntu and it works great as well :)   </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  And if they decide "fuck it. Not worth it" then what? What can Mozilla do them?

Probably court i guess. Things like this might have a legal background.   

I understand your frustration. No one with good tech knowledge wanted DRM on the web, but there was no viable alternative at that time too, even now.   
Plus one for-good; do-good organization standing up against behemoths of the industry can't win the fight, its quite obvious.  

Problem is normal people don't care about ethics and whats good for all as long as it work. They are willing to sacrifice privacy, good-will etc. as long as "it works"  

And yea Mozilla still maintain its anti-DRM stance with a non CDM verison of firefox. So up to you as a user to suit your needs.  
They dont force you and you still have a choice.

	<TEXT> Yes I agree to what you've said.  
People can hopefully afford the cost bump also.   

But bumping up ram to accommodate apps is not the right approach to this problem.   
Min requirements for Android or a Linux based desktop environment is 512Mb and I think it should stay as such.   
Optimization should be carried on the apps that consume a lot of memory.   
More stringent testing and restrictions should be made to ensure apps run on the minimum requirements before being released into the public.   </TEXT>

There a heck load of junk in a browser that's absolutely unnecessary and nothing is being done to address that.

	<TEXT> I think i wasn't clear.  
I'll take the example of moto g here, its perfectly engineered.  
Solid build, great plastics, and amazing design. It fits in your palm without any effort and stays there perfect.   
Software and battery life is highly optimized because they choose the best components on the market and assemble them.  
No heating issue's because again great engineering.  
ROM is highly optimized. Goes on for weeks without restarting.  
Great call quality(i only find this in moto) and network range. - Decades of experience.  

I don't care much from which place a phone is manufactured be it india china etc. I want good quality for the price i pay.  

I had the Micromax canvas 2 a110 before, that thing had a massive battery drain, lack of OS updates, build quality was okay when compared to the moto g, touch screen ghost touches when connected to a charger. Also had a visit to the service center to get the touch fixed and had a wonderful(/s) time there.    
These problems don't get addressed really well when you rebrand a phone, because you had no say in the manufacturing. You just put a stock rom with bloatware and ship for a good price.  

So in-short rebranding is okay, but as a company you will never grow.  
And atleast if you are rebranding optimize, optimize and optimize the Software.  
Thats the least you could do if you sell a rebranded phone.  

EDIT - the cam in the canvas 2 was good though! :)   </TEXT>
