I could then re-name the file "foo2" and move it to a different folder. It doesn't matter, all that does is change where *I* see the file. To iTunes it's still 12345 and it's still stored in the same place on the disk. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Is there such a concept as malemployment in economics as there is with malinvestment? That is, reducing UI might lead to a lower unemployment rate but a higher malemployment rate - people working in jobs that are not close to the economic optimum because they feel forced to take the first thing that comes along. 

Underemployment doesn't quite get at what I'm thinking about here because someone could be underemployed just because there are no jobs equal to his or her level of training, whereas malemployment would be more of a search problem for those jobs that do exist. The difference between the two would sort of be like the difference between a liquidity and a solvency problem at a bank. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If OBE's represent physically real phenomena, they should be relatively easy to test. Just put some random objects in a locked room and have someone who is out-of-body float over and take a look at them. Very simple and very scientific. Monroe claimed to have a technology that could reliably produce OBE's.

However, he seemed far more interested in cataloging scads of "other realms" and altered states which he numbered like Focus 1-100 and encounters with alien beings that were completely unverifiable. It is interesting stuff and might very well represent real *inner* experiences (that is, I don't think Monroe was just making stuff up - he was a wealthy man before starting his paranormal research), but he was not a proper scientist.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It does more than "stink," it will strangle the economy in the long run. Health care doesn't work as a market because prices are opaque, there is no time for price discovery anyway in an emergency, demand is almost completely inelastic, and there are no substitute goods (can't buy anything else if you're dead or incapacitated.) 

If Obamacare fails companies are going to push more healthcare costs on to their workers or drop plans altogether, and then you really will see perceived disposable income start to fall, since most will consider health insurance a necessity. Consumer demand will take a big hit and the economy will suffer further. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not so sure it's arbitrary. At least with the specific example you refer to (xenia), the Greek religion believed gods would travel disguised as humans, rewarding good hosts and punishing bad ones. 

Of course this reflected/reinforced an underlying cultural attitude, but I don't think that just comes out of nowhere. Caring for a guest can be expensive, not to mention possibly dangerous. There must have been reasons why such customs arose despite these costs. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, I've thought of that - NOT that I am claiming to be a bodhisattva!

I always thought the compassion and non-attachment sides of Buddhism were in conflict with each other. Compassion seems to all be about caring for others, and non-attachment seems to be about withdrawing from the world, including others.

Maybe it's a creative tension though. I can see how compassion can get people past their self-attachment, but that makes compassion instrumental (i.e. "I am only trying to feel for you in order to ease my own suffering"), and I'm not really comfortable with that.

But I am only a Level 1 Laser Lotus so I'm sure your insight is far more advanced! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't necessarily believe in some of the "mystical" aspects of Buddhism (cosmic Buddhas, reincarnation, siddhis, etc.), but I've been influenced by Buddhist philosophy since I was a young teenager. I meditate and admire Buddhist leaders and speakers. 

However I've never called myself a Buddhist or even a "secular Buddhist" and recently I've realized my main "block" to the tradition is that I'm ok with suffering. If that's the price for loving the world and trying to build a self, I can accept that. To eliminate suffering by giving up that attachment to life seems like a bad deal to me.

Anyone else feel the same way? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't think that actually goes on a lot in the US. It is so easy to destroy someone's character image or reputation, you don't need to be blatant about it and actually kill them (see: Assange, others.) JFK himself is a different story since he had real power to change things, but I doubt any witnesses to the assassination were themselves assassinated. In any large group of people there will be strange deaths.

Extreme Republicans got themselves worked up thinking Hillary Clinton was offing dozens of people to cover up her shady real estate deals by basically going through the list of everyone she knew. Guess what? Some of them had died in weird ways... that doesn't mean she killed them, it means she was a politician who knew a ton of people. </TEXT>

That might be exactly what he's doing. If he really does want to consolidate power, the chaos of a revolutionary situation might be his best bet. Of course, if you lose that bet you lose the country, but he might be willing to roll the dice. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't think NATO ever stopped fearing a Soviet invasion, right up until the fall of the Soviet Union. Also, I don't think it was ever proven that the more extreme actions of some Gladio groups were directed by NATO, or part of a coherent NATO strategy to undermine native communism in Western Europe. Most historians believe that a few of these groups decided to take matters into their own hands, or that Gladio recruited extreme rightists thinking they would follow orders, and they didn't. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would distinguish between a honeypot and something like Gladio. A honeypot is a government agent or false group that poses as an extremist leader or oganization to attract followers, then the whole group is rounded up, since of course the leader knows who everyone is, etc. 

Gladio was a covert stay-behind guerrilla force set up by NATO in preparation for a possible Soviet invasion. Unfortunately the kind of folks who are eager to join covert stay-behind guerrilla forces are not always the best-disciplined people on the planet, and several Gladio units started freelancing in organized crime and extreme right-wing activities, most notably in Italy and Turkey. </TEXT>
