Every time I bring in a texture in as a .tiff or .psd, nothing shows up. It's just a "Replace Me" cube. What do I do?
Please don't point me to the manual, as I have already read it. The cryblend manual dosnt work either.
Tell me please, what are the steps to add textures to my blender exported model. Maybe I'm not doing it right.

However, when I want to add texture, I have to add materials to each seperate section of the mesh. If I join all the objects together, it makes a huge mess. What do I do? </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT>   Okay. So, what we do is we create one big ass map in a 3d modeling program and compose a texture atlas. We export that as an fbx and bring it into unreal engine. Using gimp or photoshop, we create an even bigger ass image texture. Finally, we unwrap that kush and bam, a realistic map. I think this would do great with terrain, as Unreal Engine isn't good with rendering dirt or sand.
The only flaws I see with my idea is:
A: How do we get the image to unwrap in specific areas?
B: How big of an image would we need? </TEXT>

I was in third place, and edging ever so close to passing the individual in second place. Suddenly, the unthinkable happens. I fall. I go from 3rd to last place. I fall in front of my family, my girlfriend, and 1000 people. 
But this isn't the first time. It's been like this for ages. I just never meet my own expectations whether it be sports or school. I'm just done. I'm ready to go. </TEXT>
