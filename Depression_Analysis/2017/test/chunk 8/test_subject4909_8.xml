	<TEXT> Well you have to note one thing about the case. He presented his opinions on Twitter, not on a news broadcast. On his own time and not on company time so to speak. What happened then, and what is incredibly common, is that readers of the tweet took the time to track down who he was and mount a campaign, spreading a call from computer to computer, to **get** him. It worked. No doubt the campaigners felt that they had truly 'accomplished' something. When the dust clears, however, nothing in the social positions of the groups mentioned nor in government policy has changed at all. The 'victory' was purely symbolic and illusionary.

As the author mentions these sort of campaigns - and campaign it was - have become the standard crusades for both left and right. They serve as a substitute for real political action. The net result is a more restrictive public space and a build up of ill will on both 'sides' of what is called the 'culture wars'. 

This results in a certain amount of harm for a gain of nothing at all. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well I disagree. Invoking the 'tu quoque' card may be a debate ender in philosophy seminars, but in the real world where interests are at stake (always) and it is a matter of political debate it is very much legitimate. In other words 'academic purity' is only applicable when there is absolutely nothing at stake. Life is not a seminar.

To be all academic about it the 'argument by analogy' I presented is very much to the point. No doubt any debt can be paid off if it is reduced enough and delayed long enough. A recipient of such generous largesse isn't on the 'moral high ground' when dunning others to 'replay their debt' unless, of course, they are willing to extend the creditor the same advantage they had. The whole matter is actually in the Bible where Jesus speaks of motes in your neighbour's eye and beams in one's own. One of the many quotations about hypocrisy. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The first thing you should 'make of this' is that you should chose evidence that actually supports your case. The article you linked to states *very clearly* that there were times when the debt was reduced ie part of it was written off and the payment term extended. It is as if I were to take out a $5000 loan with an agreement to pay it back in five years. One year later my debt would be reduced to $4000, and the new terms were ten years. Six years later the debt would be reduced to $2000 and I would be given 20 years to pay. Finally, ten years later, the sum would be reduced to $500 and I was given a final 5 years to pay. At the end of that term I paid it off. I'd like it if I could get loans from the same lenders as Germany did.

As to 'tu quoque' it doesn't apply in a situation where the argument is about the moral standing of one party in relation to its denigration of another party. In that (this !) case "you too" is very applicable because the subject is very much the moral standing of an accuser.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> One of the "missing pieces" in the general debate about what Syriza should or shouldn't do is the matter of 'tax dodging' amongst corporations and wealthy individuals in Greece. From what I understand the prevalence of this in Greece is higher than it is even in Italy. I don't have the references in hand, but my understanding is that Syriza's efforts on this issue have been weak at best. The international bankers and other institutions are quite unconcerned with this aspect of the Greek crisis. One might suspect that tightening up is the *last* thing they would want. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes, it's sad but predictable. I'm interested in what will happen in terms of the internal disputes within Syriza itself. Also in the actual story behind the story of Varoufakis' resignation. From what I have seen he is reluctant to speak plainly about the disputes that led up to his replacement. Trying to 'reform' a social democratic party is almost always a fruitless quest given the 'coalition' nature of all such parties. Greece differs from other situations only in the speed with which events developed and the importance of the subject of the internal debates.  </TEXT>
