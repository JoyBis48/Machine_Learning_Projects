	<TEXT> Just downloaded and installed Witcher 3 for PC.  

Some problems:

1.  it's slow - any way to speed up the action (witcher runs in slow mo, etc)

2.  mouse is really sensitive, even on the lowest setting it spins witcher around if I'm not careful

3.  key bindings say "none" - do I have to set key bindings on everything or is there a default setting?

Thanks! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The population is going down across the board, and teens are not looking for jobs (recent NY Times article).  76,000,000 Americans are either retiring soon (including myself), or are already retired (the Baby Boomers).  Where's the incentive to have children now?  America's birth rate is the lowest it's ever been, 12.7 per 1,000 people in 2013.  

We're not having babies and we're dying off.  Millennials and teenagers are not looking for work.

1  Burning any yeast or honey in offerings to God

2  Failing to include salt in offerings to God

3  Eating fat

4  Eating blood

5  Failing to testify against any wrongdoing youve witnessed 

6  Failing to testify against any wrongdoing youve been told about 

7  Touching an unclean animal

8  Carelessly making an oath

9  Deceiving a neighbour about something trusted to them

#1 - we've already outsourced most of our jobs to Mexico, China and India.  Nothing new here

#2 - copyright is already a thing.  you will be fined if you sell something that's copyrighted without permission, you may even go to jail.

#3 - admittedly this may be bad, but inspections in the US have been bad for over 30 years.  In my state alone, there is only 1 inspector for over 1,000 funeral homes and veterinarian hospitals...some of these places haven't been inspected in 10-15 years.  

#4 - as a medical doctor in a busy ER, we are already seeing how much control pharmacy companies have over the hospital.  It can't get worse than it already is (bad)

#5 - from the language of the article, it is not clear whether or not environmental protections are indeed affected by this.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I came to Reddit about 8 years ago from Fark.com  There were only a few hundred people using it at the time.  It was a great community.  I remember when people started comparing it to Digg...that was a huge kerfuffle when that all happened...and a bunch of top Digg submitters created subreddits here and became bigwigs again and the controversy and the naysayers and the whiners... this is just another "thing" and those people who are upset most by it will leave as they did during the last two or three "things" that have blown up on Reddit in recent years.

Meanwhile, I'll stay here, enjoying the site as I did 8 years ago. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Here's the OP's original text

The original thread where this all started: https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/345ssr/rconspiracy_new_queue_moments_ago_notice_anything/cqriaap

The more recent thread where it was discussed: http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3bf43o/the_modtalkleaks_continue_major_moderators_caught/

If you dont want to sift through the above threads, the TL;DR is this: He got caught using alts to upvote and agree with himself as well as creating SRD threads to discredit the sub. Despite the indisputable truth, Flytape bullied the other mods into removing his ban, thus calling into question his own motives for allowing someone who clearly works to discredit a sub that "he cares about" to continue to shit up everything he posts on. Now they are both lying to cover up the trail.

Blacksunalchemy has now deleted those accounts even though there are artifacts of them still around (such as the redditfun link you can find in the thread). At the time of the instance, I sent several mods the info and they all agreed that he was, in fact, clearly engaging in this behavior, but Flytape continues to bully them and protect his "buddy".

He is now back on a new alt, GorgleGoo, and started gaming the sub to try and establish credibility by posting in his own thread here: https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3bmwac/cops_livid_over_proposed_police_reform_measures/csnno6v

Fortunately other users noticed this strange behavior and called him out on another thread he derailed here: https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3bmqbt/pentagon_changes_laws_of_war_to_declare/

He follows the same MO every time: 1) Disrupt and derail the conversation with garbage. 2) When this is pointed out, claim to be an honest arbiter for the truth. 3) If that fails, then claim that you are an innocent victim of these baseless attacks!

One thing that I noticed and found extremely curious is that, on his new alt, he used an acronym that I only remember seeing one other place: https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3bmqbt/pentagon_changes_laws_of_war_to_declare/csoaxzk

I consider myself a CT

This immediately brought to mind another user who constantly disrupts and harasses others on the sub, CT_Warlock. This would follow the naming convention that he likes of dark wizard stuff from MagicTG blacksunalchemy and nomed_yob (boy demon). 100% proof? Nope but just another coincidence that I thought should be pointed out.

Furthermore, lets also not forget that he likes to claim to be a video expert. He draws signs in photoshop for a living as he has freely admitted several times. Nothing wrong with that. This, however, does not make one an expert in video, which he claims to be in order to make the invalid argument from authority in order to debunk others. I, for instance, am a materials scientist, but I dont claim to be an expert in rocketry just because they also call themselves scientists the whole idea of that is absurd. Example of him debunking the faked ISIS videos here: https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2thvuu/debunked_the_latest_isis_video_of_two_japanese/

Since we cannot count on the mods to help the situation on this subreddit, and even have to question what motivation Flytape would have for defending a user who was caught red-handed gaming the sub and posting SRD threads to discredit the sub, I think it is only prudent that the userbase be the ones to police themselves.

Great job to those in that thread who caught on quickly to his games and called him out. We need to be the change that we want to see. Keep up the good work, guys.

The Intercept

Of the MSM, I read the New York Times headlines, and other related sites, just to get a sense of what's going on.

I skim the new posts off GLP to see if anything grabs my attention (it's mostly junk, but once in a while something interesting appears).

Then just a shitload of other middle-of the road sites that are too peripheral to mention here.  I read between the lines and don't take anything too seriously...I read them to get a general "pulse" of what's happening

It is interesting because there have been more reports of bear sightings not just where they are more common (like Montague for example), but in Holyoke, East Longmeadow, Northampton and Amherst.

	<TEXT> A lot of fundies here too.  Consider the posts about the rapture and related nonsense about prophesies, etc.

Also a lot of unsourced stories that are probably hoaxes and frauds.  Consider anything from Infowars, prisonplanet, alex jones to be an outright fraud; and anything from Veterans Today to be at least 40% lies (according to Veterans Today Editor, Gordon Duff).

Sure people here are less likely to believe whatever latest crap is being trundled out by the main stream media, but there's a lot of alt media crap posted here also. </TEXT>
