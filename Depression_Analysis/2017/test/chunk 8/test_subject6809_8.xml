	<TEXT> Sweden's efforts address a problem that all countries face. At least they are doing something head on to combat the issue of waste streams.

	<TEXT> The $2.40 figure comes from an economic study published in the journal of Energy and Buildngs (linked here: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778813007652)
This dollar value was calculated by performing a 50-year life-cycle cost analysis of white roofs versus black roofs. Regardless of cost savings, this article points out that those who are concerned about climate change "should choose white roofs, which are three times more effective than green roofs at cooling the globe." </TEXT>
