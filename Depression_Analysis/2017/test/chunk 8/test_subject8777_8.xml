	<TEXT> I am leaving on a 6mo contract next month with Royal Caribbean as an audio tech/stage hand and I still have some questions but the company is being quite vague with me. Here are some questions I have and feel free to let me know how your overall experience was as well! Thanks!
My 5 Questions:

I am a drummer and would not enjoy not being able to play for 6mo. Is there a staff lounge with say a piano and drum kit you can play?

How easy is it really to change rooms if you don't get along with your roommate?

How are the hours of work? I have heard many different things, anywhere from 12+hrs all week to some days are 12hr days and some are 2hr days.

Can you fast track yourself to a higher up position during your first contract? Can you do it at all?

Are you allowed off the ship when in port if there is no work to be had?

Thanks everyone! I look forward to some responses! It will help me out greatly :)

	<TEXT> I honestly don't know if me having a gun would have made the situation better or worse. Trying to go for a gun when one is already drawn on you, unless you're a quick draw, I feel like it would do more harm than good.

I do not own a gun, have never fired a gun nor do I plan to purchase one for my own safety.. I don't feel like I live in an unsafe area even tho this happened to me. The police said it was the first armed robbery in over 10yrs to happen in the town so a freak incident. Altho I have been toying around with the idea of hunting for the last year or so..

After the robbery I was very hesitant to go back to work and my bosses actually wanted me to close the bar the very next day and I literally had to plea with then to give me the night off and they reluctantly did because I think they knew I would have just quit. I was able to talk to a counselor and therapist a couple times that the victims unit of my police department provided. I was having a hard time wrapping my head around the whole ordeal and why it had to happen to me and to a degree still am but I have kind of come to grips with the fact that it was a sign to start making moves in my life and have started to do just that. And yes, I still close the bar at night but am much more cautious and nervous when doing so, but I put my two weeks in tonight so not too much longer  </TEXT>

So I actually got a new and much better job that I could consider a career and put my two weeks in tonight. So it definitely gave me a life kick in the ass. 

 He had hosiery or tights over his face so I could not really see his face bt I saw what he was wearing and could recognize the voice again if I ever heard it.. Something I doubt I will ever forget </TEXT>

That's really what I want  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  I was about 90% sure I was going to die that night. He could have done it so easily and my co worker didn't give him all the money (although the robber didn't know that) bt if he did that would have been all the reason he needed to do me in. When I think back about it, there are so many things I wish I would have done, but in the moment there was no chance I would have actually done it. But it is interesting to look at the situation from a few different ways in my head. I will have to check out that book tho, sounds interesting to me, especially now  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you, and it was actually kind of hard to bring myself to go back.. I am not the kind of person who has things really bother me after the fact, bt this shook me up and I didn't really want to go back to work right away. My bosses actually wanted me to close the next night which floored me and I literally had to plea with them to let me take the night off. Reluctantly they gave me the night off but it was like twisting their arm which kind of soured me on the establishment even more. I will say I am way more cautious/nervous closing now, but actually I put my two weeks tonight and got a new job. It's just too much of an uneasy feeling at my current job </TEXT>

	<TEXT> At first when I saw him come from the back I thought it was a joke until he came right next to me and put the gun in my face and put his hand on my shoulder and pushed me to my knees and then down on my stomach and told me to stay there. What's funny tho is I have thought in the past if something like this was to happen to me, I would totally just knock the gun out of his hand and tackle the dude and blah blah blah but when it happened, none of those thoughts came into my head. The robber said if I moved, or saw the cops or didn't get all the money he was going to spray my head all over the floor and even though he got everything he came there for, I was about 90% sure I was going to die that night because he could have done it so easy.. And the only thing that was honestly going through my head was I didn't want to die and that it was very cold on the floor and not a place I wanted to die. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well the short of it is, I was closing up at the bar I work at in my little Mtn town I live in around 12am on a Friday. Guy came out the back, drew a gun on me and made me get to the floor while my co worker emptied the register.. All the while having the gun pressed to my temple as I lay on the ground.. Ask me anything, I can give more details and nothing is off limits.
