	<TEXT> In the UK there have been multiple, upheld court cases where drivers have been prosecuted for crossing red lights (by automated cameras) to let through emergency services vehicles. 

Not our finest hour, and I'm sad to say that if I'm at the front of a set of lights with a camera and the choice is sit tight or get a ticket, I'm turning the radio up a notch... :-/

	<TEXT> Sorry, I disagree. This quote:
 "If we don't have a competitive engine in the near future, then either Audi is coming or we are out," said Marko.

...is pretty inflammatory and doesn't really need a whole lot more blowing up.

When did you last hear someone from Williams say this. Or Lotus? Or even Marussia, FFS. Not impressed with Red Bull this year. My six year old son handles defeat better than they do. And he can sulk like a champion too! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Note: In the UK, the chances of him driving again any time soon would be pretty much zip. Unsurprisingly, we are somewhat reticent about letting people back on the road if they might fall unconscious at the wheel. IIRC, 1 month if they can find a cause, 6 months (or more) if they can't and therefore can't be sure it won't happen again.

Tough love, but it would be for his benefit, as well as those about him. He could very easily have killed someone there...next time, he might find that he's burnt up all of his luck credits already :-/

Anyone know what the situation would be in the USofA? </TEXT>

Alonso was also competing but his shorts exploded at the 15th mile marker. He was, however, upbeat and said that Honda were due to deliver uprated shorts in time for Barcelona.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Is it me, or are those wheels just downright _wrong_ for the car? They look to me to be the incorrect offset, forgetting the obvious fact that they are clearly too big!

In the UK, at least, they would be illegal as the protrude from the wheel arches and would thus be dangerous to other road users, but especially "soft targets" such as cyclists or pedestrians. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Does anyone have any feedback on how good, technically, this kit is?

Looking at the raincoat and softshells, which are upwards of 100, there's very little information on what they are made from. If I was buying in a shop, I'd probably expect gore-tex or Windstopper type materials at that price....

Obviously, I'd expect the very best here, especially as they are being subsidised by the sponsors' logos ;-) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In the UK, never had to have a sick note for anything less than a few days off (honestly, I can remember how long and it's been nearly 10 years since I had more than a couple off in a row).

If I put my manager hat on, I perhaps would get a little grumpy at "Morning After The Night Before" illnesses. Not because of the time off, but more because of the diligent staff that have to pick up the extra work and cover for those who aren't as conscientious.

I'm pleased to say that for the last 10 years I've worked with a great team who wouldn't dream of dropping people in the shit like this, and arguing about the odd sick day here and there would never have crossed my mind.

Treat people like kids and they'll just return the favour... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Quite right too, sir!

All I saw on Sunday was a team *and* a driver who were /so/ excited to win. It was great to see regardless of which team you support.

There were no losers this Sunday.

I supported Lewis last year, but I'd be lying if I denied that a bit of me wants to see Vettel win with Ferrari.

Just because people support the sport and not necessarily a specific team or driver does not make them less of a fan... </TEXT>
