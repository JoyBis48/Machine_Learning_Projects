With the video evidence it would still be considered a no-fault accident, and i'm sure the insurance company would sue the PT driver for causing the accident.

Even so he has video evidence that proves he was trying to avoid an accident.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They probably drive just like OP. Guess growing up in LA traffic has made me more aware of other drivers. 

Even just watching the video made me want to slow down seeing the traffic merge. He practically drove into her blind spot.

Don't get me wrong, the PT is completely at fault. 

Edit - I will take the downvotes because this was completely avoidable accident.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If OP were to apply the brakes (not slam on them) and make a move to the left lane, that PT wouldn't have hit OP. Why is his first reaction to just honk the horn? If you are a defensive driver you would be letting off the gas and slowing down and ready to hit the brakes moments before OP just honks his horn. OP didn't even try to slow down even after he honks.

Even if there was a car in the next lane that OP hits trying to evade, he has video evidence he was trying to avoid an accident.

20 years of driving defensively i haven't been in any accidents, and have been in OP's situation many times. Don't expect other drivers to be paying attention at all times, especially when they are merging in the lane next to you. </TEXT>

hoping the impact might be a bit lighter

OP had enough time to realize what was happening for him to honk his horn, instead of making a controlled maneuver to evade. By the time the other driver has time to realize what the honk was for, OP could have got into the other lane. </TEXT>

Edit - ~~I'm not going to try to argue this anymore~~, this accident could have been avoided if OP was a defensive driver.

edit2 - Just realized that another comment was downvoted to hell for saying the samething.

	<TEXT> Even if this quote "rifle behind every blade of grass" isn't really made by Isoroku Yamamoto, it speaks the truth.

 In 1960, Robert Menard was a commander aboard the USS Constellation when he was part of a meeting between United States Navy personnel and their counterparts in the Japanese Defense Forces.
Fifteen years had passed since VJ Day, most of those at the meeting were WWII veterans, and men who had fought each other to the death at sea were now comrades in battle who could confide in each other.
Someone at the table asked a Japanese admiral why, with the Pacific Fleet devastated at Pearl Harbor and the mainland U.S. forces in what Japan had to know was a pathetic state of unreadiness, Japan had not simply invaded the West Coast.
Commander Menard would never forget the crafty look on the Japanese commander's face as he frankly answered the question.
'You are right,' he told the Americans. 'We did indeed know much about your preparedness. We knew that probably every second home in your country contained firearms. We knew that your country actually had state championships for private citizens shooting military rifles. We were not fools to set foot in such quicksand.' </TEXT>
