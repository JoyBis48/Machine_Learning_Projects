	<TEXT> Tolls on all highways and major roads around Detroit. (People don't leave the city. If people wanted to avoid tolls, they go on other roads = more congestion = more business development). Cut Taxes on houses, businesses, and industry, which will attract people from outside the city. Add more police patrols to reduce crime. Build from the inner core and expand outwards. Build Public Transit Infrastructure, once there is density. Education, healthcare, parks, social services, etc later on.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Modern because we decided that we should send our factories over there and China decided to explore capitalism. Double Edge Sword? We want to "help developing countries", but doing so might hurt us. Then, we complain that we aren't growing as fast as them even though China has more people and it should be expected that they will have the largest GDP in the world. The real surprise is how the USA maintained its economic power for so long.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree. Over-specialization can bad. Look what happened to Detroit, when automation and outsourcing happened. If any major war. financial crisis, or whatever happens between the US and other countries, we wouldn't have the facilities to produce our own goods. We would be hit with a recession first, if that happens, since other countries would block imports to us. Prices will rise for all of us. In reality, nobody knows what the true cost of goods are, since there are so many external factors.

It is interesting though. Could the USA should export more goods than imports in goods to pay down our trillions of dollars of debt?

Think about the comparative advantage of producing in "developing" countries! (This is a better term than "Third World", since this isn't a Cold War setting). 

We get cheap goods. Living Standards increase for developing countries. We specialize in something else rather than manufacturing. :) </TEXT>
