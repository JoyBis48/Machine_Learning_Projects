	<TEXT> I bent the ones on my z97n wifi motherboard by putting the usb 3.0 header from my case in the wrong way. It will bend the pins so bad if you dont line it up because there is a blocked off pin on the cable to "prevent" it from going in. I tried a straw and it was a bit to big, so i used the mini straw off of some canned air and carefully bent the pins back. Luckily, they work perfect now. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Most of the people I have talked to that wanted to go into the game industry (quite a few) changed their mind very quickly. Just because you like to play games does not mean you will like to make them. That field is a big money maker for the small "ITT Tech" schools and they know that. So many people want to go into game design that you have to be the cream of the crop when it comes around to getting a job, or you have to hit it big as an indie developer. If I were you I would seriously reconsider your job path.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Your CPU is running a bit hot, even on idle. I would clean the CPU with isopropyl alcohol and reapply a good thermal paste like arctic silver. 

That should be the cause of the temps, or either your CPU cooler is not making good contact with the CPU.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We have the next best where I live, and that is Cookout. Cookout milkshakes are so good, it makes the milkshake in that picture look like a garbage Wendy's frosty. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think the gpu they decided to use is underpowered for an almost 4k resolution display. Even a single gtx 780ti/titan black has trouble playing games at 4k, which is what this computer is marketed as. Laptop gpus are much weaker than their desktop counterparts.  The only game that i see running at 4k maxed out on this laptop are source engine games and various others. (counter strike, dota 2, team fortress 2, etc.) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Exactly, you hit the nail on the head. I have built "gaming" computers, but when I tried my first macbook pro with retina display, the OS just sold me. That influenced me to build my hackintosh, and it was the best decision i ever made.  </TEXT>
