Maybe The Stand? It was 1200 pages long and it never felt like it. Even books half that size start getting annoying. So,yea, I guess The Stand by Stephen King.

	<TEXT> Well I'm glad the reccomendation got through.

Sometimes books are the best medium for story. Like, imagine that The Stranger was a movie. 

How would they show the things he thought?

They just wouldn't be able to.


I guess they could have him narrarate his feelings, but that's lazy. 

I guess, to understand the appeal of books, you have to read good books. Books that are special. And "The Stranger" is def special. </TEXT>

Honestly, one of the reasons I signed up for the navy was for this very thing. I hated being in college. Not knowing what the future was gonna be like, but now I know that in two or three years ill be inside some navy ship doing my job. Before I signed up I had no idea. </TEXT>

When I talk to a girl, every little thing becomes a potential snowball. Hmm. She doesn't like action movies... So when we're married, how am I gonna watch new releases? 

I'm going to the navy soon, I knew about this eight months ago, and honestly, these months have passed by so quickly and I haven't accomplished anything else beyond waiting. All I do evry day is think about it. I lost eight months of my life. Just waiting.

I quit my job a year ago because I didn't want to be there my whole life.

I forget about the past because it happened already.


Anyone else like this?

	<TITLE> Do I understand evolution correctly? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-04-04 07:59:29 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Don't know if this is going to be long, but here we go.

Basically from what I've retained from secondary education, science documentaries and basic critical thinking I've come to accept evolution like this:

An animal or plant, whichever, mates with a compatible mate. Their offspring takes a little bit of each of the animals. They grow up to eventually have their own offspring. Somehow there is a mistake in the passing down of genes, and the offspring of this animal has brown fur. Peers of this animals find this unattractive and the animal doesn mate.

Generations later this mutation comes up again and this animal mates. passes down his mutation. Then that offspring moves away to a further tree by another river. Generations pass, and another mutation happens, larger feet. It gives this animal superiority, so he takes over. Suddenly generations later this tribe that moved away to this other river has brown fur and big feet, not like their black fur small feet having neighbors. The neighbors meet up at the big feet havers decide to kill the others. Now all animals of this species start carrying the brown fur and big feet genes.

I can keep typing but i guess that this is good enough, so do I understand evolution? </TEXT>
