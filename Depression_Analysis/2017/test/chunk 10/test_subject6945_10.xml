	<TEXT> No chance. I went to the last rally more so as a spectator, and the behavior on both sides of the rally was disgusting. 

I saw counter protesters assaulting and spitting on people.  

I also saw the reclaim Australia people screaming racial slurs and trying to intimidate people in smaller groups. 

Honestly it was an embarrassment to say the least. Both sides should be ashamed of themselves. Neither were proving anything except that people are arseholes no matter what side of the argument they are on.       </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Accidentally dry humped my cat the other morning. Jumped into bed after i finished a 12 hour night shift, and for some reason im always super horny when i get into bed after these night shifts. 

Anyway i snuggle up to my sleeping partner and try to wake her with a gentle grind.. After about 2 minutes i hear a faint meow. I lift my leg and look under the blanket to see my poor indy with a horrified look on her face. 

Poor little fucker.  </TEXT>
