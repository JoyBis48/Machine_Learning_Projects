	<TEXT> I've actually rolled a car when I was 14.  Valentine's day, 1998 to be specific.  Icy roads, and my dad was too drunk to drive, so I did.  I rolled a 1972 Toyota Corona.  Ever had to roll down the window to roll it up, and shove a 330 lb man off of you because he didn't wear a seat belt?  I have.  I won't drive anything anywhere if people aren't belted in.  

I don't care if I'm in ID.  No seatbelt = me no drive.  I'll turn off the car and put it in neutrual.  It's amazing how strong a 95 lb 14 year old kid is in a life threatening situation. (a 330 lb man who is my dad is laying on top of me, pick him up and throw him to the passenger side).  take off the seat belt, and fall down to the roof.  Then the mile long walk to the ranch house, "grandpa, I had a wreck, the cars upside down, and my dad is stuck inside".  That was a great year, 98.  Best year ever.  I wish I could re-live 02/14/98 every day.  NOT.  

We were supposed to have lobster that day.  Didn't happen.  My dad got his ass kicked by my grandpa, and I had to drive the now fucked up car home.  Fun times.  NOT.  I drove to town later that night and picked up papa murphy's, because the lobster went bad.  I haven't went on that road since. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I didn't notice any give when I was a dumbass 19 year old kid driving down the road trying to read my mail.  One second, on the road, the next, 20 feet down, and desperatly trying to stop, (and couldn't because I was literally in the water and going 50), , and then hit something under water so hard that it sunk my stereo reciever in my dash by a foot, and almost got hit in the head by by sub, (unsecure load).  I almost shot out my rear window until I realized "hey what If I try and roll down my driver window?.  It worked, so I crawled out.  I had my .45LC lined up and was about ready to shoot until I remembered "try rolling down the window before shooting".  That saved me about $710 of glass damage.  I had my finger on the trigger and was about ready to squeeze off a round.  I thought I was trapped because my doors wouldn't open.  That sudden stop, (still don't know what I hit underwater when I was in that ditch even 12 years later, but that sudden stop hurt like hell). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's why the HANS restraining device is mandantory in NASCAR and NHRA racing.  Don't have it?  Simple solution.  You're not on the track.  Dale Earnhardt's death made it mandatory in NASCAR.  I remember that wreck on the final lap of the 2001 Daytona 500 very well.  I broke the news to my dad that "Earnhardt is dead!". :(  We never watched NASCAR again together again.  I tried back in 2007, but it just wasn't the same without "The Intimidator".  Haven't bothered watching it since.  I used to keep a race schedule 2 years in advance.  It used to be our "church".  Now, I have no idea when the next race is besides "sunday?" </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In WA, it says I either have to have a windshield, or wear goggles.  (understandable).  Legally, there's nothing stopping me from chopping off the entire top of my truck off, and driving it down the road with a pair of ski goggles on.  (no, I'm not doing that, I've already drove with a failed heating fan, and that was cold enough to freeze up the inside of the windshield so I had to put on my shades and hang out the window at 60 to see where the hell I was going).

Good point about the noise ordinances. :)  I completly forgot about that. :)  I rebuilt my father's 93 Geo Metro back in 2001, and decided "fuck the exhaust, and just ran a straight pipe.  He got a warning about 121 dB :D  I put on a muffler. :D I didn't bother with the cat since no emissions control around here.  (why I put on a glass pack on a Metro?  because I had an extra one, so why not?)  It met noise ordinances. :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> OK, assuming the DMV approved it, and gave me registration, what would a cop do if I got pulled over for I don't know, taking an improper right turn? but when stopped, and he looked in, I was strapped in like I'm on the track, and was wearing a full helmet, a 5pt restraining device, and had a HANS restraining device strapping my head in to I didn't snap my neck in case I did a Dale Earnhardt, and had to actually take off all of my saftey gear before I could even get access to the glove box to get my DL/Reg/Ins?  (No, I don't have like $250,000 to put into such an old truck, so this question is purely hypothetical).  For the sake of argument, noise ordinances don't exist, so I didn't get stopped for being as loud as a jet taking off. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> OK, I did a lot of stupid shit to my rig when I was 16, (my door wouldn't lock shut one time, so I slammed it shut, and welded it closed).  I had to get out of my car NASCAR style for 2 years until I got into a head-on and kind of had to get rid of that rig because I ruined it).  But as a grown ass man, I know how to fix a door that won't latch shut, and I don't need a mig welder anymore.  :)  But good point.  Although the thought of duct tape never entered my mind to use for anything besides the air intake manifold, (and it worked).

Hmm, so what if I had endless money, and decided to convert my truck into a "race ready, street legal" truck, and got pulled over in a converted 1997 Blazer LT obviously purposly rebuilt for the track, but met legal requirements to be a legal road vehicle.  (hey, if people can ride horses on the street, why can't I legally drive my hypothetically converted truck down the road so long as I obey all laws?)  Let's say I met all NASCAR/NHRA requirements, but also had indicators, plates, lights, (and in some areas a muffler and cat)?  (and if I had endless money, there's no way in hell I would waste my time with my truck, I'd just build one). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've rolled a car when I was 14, and my dad wasn't wearing a seatbelt.  I was.  A 330lb man landed on a 95 lb child.  He was too drunk to drive, so I did.  It was Valentine's Day, 1997.  It's amazing how strong a 14 year old kid is when he's upside down and trapped.  After that incident, I refuse to move a vehicle unless everybody is belted in.  I literally picked him up off of me, and thew him back to the passenger side.  Then the mile long walk back to the ranch house.  That was fun.  NOT.  It was confusing enough getting out of a standard seat belt in a 1972 Toyota Corona, (after I shoved my dad off of me).  I had to crawl UP to the underbody of the car and get out.  and roll my window down, (which is now up), to climb out.  My granddad kicked my dad's ass because he was too drunk to drive, and had to pull us out with a D6.  Yes, the car still drove when righted, (but very shittily).  I had to drive home because my dad was drunk, and just got his ass kicked.

Good point about the fire though.  Had it caught on fire, I would have likely decided "fuck this!" and just ran.  Getting out of a 5pt restraint harness would have been almost impossible.  That's a good reason. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, but why?  I could get behind the wheel of the 51 ford (with no belts at all), and go 60MPH down the highway, (legal speed limit), if I wanted to, but I won't because I don't want to be road pizza.  I think a **minimum** of a 3 pt restraining harness should be mandatory, but if you want to strip your rig and make it a race vehicle, you should be allowed to, (so long as your street legal).  Why would they care if I gutted my truck, put in a roll bar, plexiglass shielding, welded my doors shut, put in a roll bar with cross members, put in a racing seat, and a 5 pt restraining harness with a HANS restraint device, and wore a helmet, and drove down the road?  (I mean besides the fact I'm taking a truck designed for the track out on the street).

	<TEXT> They've had that page up for 3 years now.  It's just flat out wrong.  When I called the cable company earlier this year, I had a question about why in the 90's that I was able to pick up cable TV with my antenna if I pointed it SSE, and had a complete channel line up, and would it work now?"  (yes, it really did happen, I was able to pick up a cable system over 30 miles away if the conditions were right).

They said likely a signal leak from a neighbor, but "it won't work now because every device connected to the network must be authorized."  I know that statement is false, because my analog TV just works like it always has, and my HDTV works perfectly fine to pick up both analog and ClearQAM service.  I never registered my serials with them, and just plugged them into the wall.  Cable here works just as it always has.

I still haven't gotten a satisfactory answer to how come I was able to pick up a city over 30 miles away cable TV system on my antenna back in the 90's. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I still have full analog and ClearQAM service here.  TWC on the phone says "you need a cable box".  Um, no you don't.  They say even for basic service, you need a DTC for $4/mo.  No, you don't.  Just plug your TV into the wall, and away you go.

**EDIT:**

To get access to the cable hookup, you'll need one of [these](http://www.techtoolsupply.com/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=lk03009276):

And if the terminal is capped off, you'll need one of [these](http://www.techtoolsupply.com/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=RMT-LTT7):

To properly torque the connection, you'll need one of [these](http://www.techtoolsupply.com/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=TWAF-71630):

Congratulations, now you can hook up cable in most places.

	<TEXT>  [MS15-078](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/security/MS15-078) is the patch for a vulnerability in Microsoft font driver that could allow remote code execution.

The security bulletin stated:

This security update resolves a vulnerability in Microsoft Windows. The vulnerability could allow remote code execution if a user opens a specially crafted document or visits an untrusted webpage that contains embedded OpenType fonts. This security update is rated Critical for all supported releases of Microsoft Windows.

Under vulnerability information, Microsoft wrote:

OpenType Font Driver Vulnerability - CVE-2015-2426

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Microsoft Windows when the Windows Adobe Type Manager Library improperly handles specially crafted OpenType fonts. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

There are multiple ways an attacker could exploit this vulnerability, such as by convincing a user to open a specially crafted document, or by convincing a user to visit an untrusted webpage that contains embedded OpenType fonts. The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how the Windows Adobe Type Manager Library handles OpenType fonts.

When this security bulletin was issued, Microsoft had information to indicate that this vulnerability was public but did not have any information to indicate this vulnerability had been used to attack customers. Our analysis has shown that exploit code could be created in such a way that an attacker could consistently exploit this vulnerability. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They cannot tell what you are watching.  A TV is just a receiver, and does not transmit.  The only way they can tell if you are watching is if you have a cable company cable box.  You could watch it to your heart's content.  If caught, (doubtful), the most that will happen is they'll put a trap back on the line, and one day you'll come home and have either nothing on TV, or basic service (local broadcast channels), only.  

Then just wait a week, and go outside and take off the trap yourself, and you'll have all the channels again.  You can get a terminator removal tool on eBay for like $5, and a P-key is about $15.  The chances of getting caught are nil.

**EDIT:**  Just don't report a cable TV outage. ;) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Because of the enormous weight of the towers, they have to be anchored to solid beddrock, or a large concrete slab with enough mass to prevent the tower from falling over in high winds.  After that part is done, it is built in a lattice structure, much like the core of a skyscraper is erected.  The diagonal struts add structural integrity to the tower, and make it more resistant to twisting in the wind, (or in event of an earthquake).  It is typically built from a wide base, to a narrow top where the transmission antennas are, and if extra stability is needed, guy wires are added to the tower, and angled out at a 45 degree angle for maximum torsion strength. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You know you're starting to get old when the shows of your youth are aired on TV land and Nick At Night.  When I grew up, Nick At Nite played Mr Ed, and now they air "The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air", (it used to be on NBC at 1900 hrs). When I was a youth, TVLand didn't exist.  They now have a station called "Antenna TV".  I'm old enough to remember when that was the only way I could get TV.  I was living in a giant antenna, and got 2,3,4,6.7,10,12,22,24,28,35,40.  I wired my room to be a huge antenna.  One of my friends came over during the summer of 95, and saw my setup.  "Bad reception?" was her question.  "No, it's actually pretty good now, I have 12 channels now! Wanna watch TV?" </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I already got counseled by a dietician in the hospital.  I now have several recipes for high calorie, high protein, high fat meals.  I just need to buy a blender.  And yes, my step mom is sort of mean, (and hits hard), but I obviously need it, or she wouldn't do it.  (Yes, I still get hit even though I'm a fully grown man). </TEXT>
