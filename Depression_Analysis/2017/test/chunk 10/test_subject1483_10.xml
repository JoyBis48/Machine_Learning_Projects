	<TEXT> I don't mean make it only work via headset but when the headset is plugged in it could use the headset instead of it's internal mic to pick up voice commands. It would be a lot easier for the user to give the command and for the console to hear it. The camera in the kinect is still used of course to identify the person giving the commands.


It';s just a small thing that will make the experience a lot nicer. People wouldn't have to be shouting across their living room, instead they could speak into they're mic.  </TEXT>

So for people who use the Kinect, they know that when the TV is a bit too loud the Kinect cannot hear you, which is understandable.


My solution is simple and could be done with a software update. Allow Kinect to hear your commands via the headset.


I would make the Kinect user experience a lot more tolerable, as a lot of people enjoy blasting game volume to get immersed and not being able to use the Kinect properly when doing this can ruin a game if Kinect commands are allowed within the game.


It's a small thing I know but it's a small thing that will make the console feel a lot more responsive. </TEXT>

Hadn't really thought about the fact that it would have to be 3 separate 1080p displays, I was thinking more along the lines of one big image chopped up into 3 (I'm a moron). 


I see myself getting a PC quite soon tbh, see what all the hype is about! </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Xbox One Multi-screen Windows 10.? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-07-14 15:16:12 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> For a long while now I've been wanting Xbox to make multi-screen a feature on it's console. [This latest image I've seen](https://i.imgur.com/HJ0QMju.jpg) makes me want it even more.

 nbsp;

Now I'm not sure about the capabilities of Windows 10 on Xbox One but is this something that could be done? Or is it more on the hardware side of things? Maybe an official Xbox multi-screen HDMI splitter?

 nbsp;

I'm just brainstorming ideas, but if anyone has any info on the matter it would be much appreciated.

 nbsp;

Edit: Damn. Thanks for the info guys! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well that's just like your opinion I guess.


If his story is true (which tbh is believable compared to other stories on the internet) then he got screwed over by bad/ negligent customer service and Gamestop should correct that.


But then again, that's just like my opinion I guess.
