	<TEXT> You can't really hear those quad copters.   

Especially if you're inside.   

They don't really make sound.... they are there... and then they are gone.  

Most people think its just some dude playing with his new toy if they do see it.   


I fly my quadcopter over the street and into the park... most people don't even look up at it.  and the one's that do.... "OH COOL!!! I WANT ONE!"

	<TEXT> All because he was missing a front license plate.  

Why do cops always want to just escalate the situation?   Every interaction I've had with police, even just routine traffic stops, they are so fucking MAD.   I have to ask them to calm down so that we can handle the situation in a calm and professional manner.

	<TEXT> All fictional stories aside... I'd rather reddit start a gofundme for my work here in the philippines.  

I have been helping communities rebuild after Yolanda.  

One particular baranguay, Santa Cruz, in San Francisco Southern Leyte, desperately needs a water system repair.  These people don't have water...in the jungle.     

I blew the funding for it by accidentally telling the man I was to meet with to "go back to the fucking usa" about 2 days before our meeting.  He was flipping out about a woman breastfeeding inside McDonald's in Tacloban.   I didn't know who he was or care.  It was pure coincidence.  

2 days later, he walked into the hotel lobby, sees me, laughs and walks out.   I blew the funding for water project for over 1200 people.  

So I've been trying to fund some of the repairs out of pocket.   But I can't afford to drop 40,000 dollars to fix them up.   I'd rather not take out a personal loan... but I will if it comes to that.   

Edit: I felt like editing it.

	<TEXT> [Plasma gasification](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_gasification) doesn't need a continued power source.  Once the temp is high enough, it runs itself off what you shove into it.   Like garbage.    It also recovers elements and gases and also provides other useful byproduct that is extremely hard and strong.   

The problem is... the upstart cost.  It won't turn a profit for long time. 

But I'd argue that profit is a stupid reason to generate power.   That's a whole different of worms tho.....

	<TEXT> [This one.](http://www.computerworld.com/article/2936346/byod/samsung-swiftkey-mitm-itbwcw.html)

And the thing is, samsung had a fix just kicking it on the shelf but couldn't push it out on account the carrier wants it's dick in everything.  


And this problem didn't effect unlocked devices because those did not have swiftkey bloatware.   You know.. that stuff that makes your phone "cheaper" and ruins the battery life.  Simply turning off the swiftkey or uninstalling it did not fix the security hole.  Once it was installed, it was embedded in the system.   

And the people with unlocked devices, that voluntarily installed swiftkey, were able to remove it by reflashing the rom. 

But verizon demands its devices be locked down "for protection of the network".   There is not a single fucking case where an unlocked device has harmed the network.   So verizon also likes to claim it's for support reasons.  Welp... here's a case where holding people's hands and locking their devices actually caused a massive fucking support issue.   

The ultimate point is: STOP BUYING THE RIP-OFF SUBSIDIZED LOCKED DEVICES, PEOPLE!!! It's bullshit.   You'll save money by having the freedom to shop around for carriers. And you won't have all your personal data get ripped off by bloatware hacks.  

Edit: And lastly, people with unlocked devices fixed that 5.0.1 memory leak a LONG time ago.    </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Many 3rd party dealers offer financing for a fully unlocked device.  

Then there is buy now pay later on paypal.   

I pay with a credit card and pay off the device over about 4 months and pay less than if I add up 

1. never owning the device and changing the software as I see fit.  Samsung galaxy owners just found out about a HUGE hole in the security of the device that samsung had a fix for for half a year.  But they can't get updates past the dumbass carriers.   Security holes are a HUGE cost when that bill comes due.  

2. being locked into 24 months of contracts where i cannot switch carriers and bargain for a better deal elsewhere.   

The unlocked devices generally support more bands and allow me to switch carriers and still enjoy the full benefits of the network.   

And the carrier is not fronting any cost.  That cost is paid by the bloatware companies LONG before you purchase  the privilege to use the device that they maintain control over.

The thing is, you save 200 bucks total cost but you spend that on the contract.   And if the device is 700 new I view this as a 500 dollar loss as I spent 500 dollars to USE a phone...   Where as if I paid 700 I paid to keep the phone and actually have an owners rights to the car.  

And not one single auto financing company ever tells you that you cannot service the vehicle or make changes to it yourself, or move to a different state, or refinance the car under a new lender....    </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is what Linux needs to get past.  Something so benign and, not really having to do with the linux system itself, can change a setting and bam no more desktop environment... ever...  

Or you shutdown a machine in perfect working order... and then you boot up (or not boot up) the next day and nothing fucking works.   

That being said, I've never had a problem with linux that I couldn't figure out how to fix myself.  

Windows is a fucking mystery.  And log files on windows are a joke with most of the time not even Microsoft Support can look at it and say what went wrong.   

I've had to reformat/reinstall windows more times than I can count.   At least when I've really borged my Xorg, I'm able to recover.    

I learned early on... when everything is working smoothly... make a copy of the xorg file and stash it somewhere.   You may need to replace it.

	<TEXT> I don't support Bernie in this.  


I support livable wage.  Decided on local cost of living.  

The reason being, $15 an hr goes a lot further in Ballground Ga than it does in Seattle Washington.   In seattle you can't live off that without roommates.  And you can't easily raise a child there on that.  

In Ballground, GA... you're getting that double wide trailer upgrade you've been wanting and that horn that plays Dixie for your lifted truck.   To the envy of everyone around you.   

All jokes aside, we need liveable wages.  Not this kicking the can hourly wage hikes.       That being said, it's okay if Bernie and I don't agree on *everything*.   He's a much smarter man than I.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes... you're correct.  

However, a company is going to respond to its customers.  And if people are calling and writing letters and flipping the fuck out... Amazon is going to react to that.  

People need to take a chill pill and focus on what's important; not allowing symbols of repression to represent our government.


Personally, I view this whole thing as ridiculous.   We are flapping a piece of cloth in the air and all hopping around hooting and hollering at it like a bunch of thick skulled cave men.

	<TEXT> This really isn't true.  The quick-charging shuts off if the temperature gets too hot.   

And if you have ceramic tile or stone counter top to rest the device on, it doesn't even feel warm during a quick-charge and it actually gets topped up faster since the battery is staying cool. 

Even so... if your battery is getting hot because you do something dumb like recharge it while it's sitting on your couch cushion, the device voltage will automatically drop when your battery heats up.   

Your battery gets much hotter during mobile network usage, video playback, or gaming than it does when it quick charges.

	<TEXT> My exynos lag never returned.  I use the app switcher pretty heavily.  

Chrome slows it DOWN Down down though.   

My snapdragon, nothing helped it.  Not turning off talkback... setting animations to 0... nothing.   The difference between my snapdragon and exynos is night and day.  

Sure the snapdragon gives me an extra hour and half battery life each day, but it runs like garbage.   I gave up after I exchanged it a second time and still got a laggy piece of shit in return.  

This is my last samsung phone.  I love the note 4 exynos... but damn samsung.  WTF!  

I would switch to LG but I heard they lock their bootloaders down pretty tight.   Maybe Motorola?  Motorola is like paying a premium price for an upper midrange device.   I don't know anything about how they do their bootloaders now.    

HTC got dumb after they released the Rezound.  

Nexus devices... ok.. but ZZzzzzzz.  They always seem cheap to me.   


Sony is abandoning mobile.   Damn android sucks right now.   Hopefully Ubuntu phone will make gains.  They had a good first attempt.... its not there yet.
