	<TEXT> Its something that's been talked about for years and every major sport has huge alcohol sponsorship and advertising how much longer until you think they ban it? 

Personally I hope they don't unless another sponsor is ready to take its place as they do give the sports a ton of cash and I don't really see who would be willing to put that much money into it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> it's a good game and i recommend playing it the story is really good but pretty short (20 or so hours) graphics are good for a 2011 game

a few things about the gameplay that you might not like

potions can't be drunk during combat you have to drink them beforehand (this includes potions like swallow)

no climbing or jumping down unless there is a certain spot the game allows it

no fast travel or horses </TEXT>

i get that i have a lot of skills and good armor and what not at that point but some of the monsters and even high level enemies put up a better fight than him

i didn't even need to use a single potion as it was just way too easy to dodge and when he was using magic he was basically a sitting duck

was a bit a of a disappointment after everything you had to do to prepare to fight him for him to go down so easily </TEXT>
