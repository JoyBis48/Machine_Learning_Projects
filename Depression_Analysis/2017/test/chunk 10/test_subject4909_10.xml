	<TEXT> Actually he's doing no such thing. Have a look at his posting history, and you may begin to understand why he is possibly the *most banned person on reddit*. As I have said before I am not the only person he copies from, and actually not the major one. He has bots that scan certain people and subreddits to pick up what they post and repost it, not uncommonly in more than 15 or 20 places. In actual fact postnationalism is the most **ultimate** points grabber I have seen in all my years on reddit. Also, to repeat myself I have made it plain *several* times that I don't give a shit if he copies anything of mine without attribution **except for** items that come from r/worldanarchism . That is a sub that I wish to promote because it has a clear and consistent ideology that I wish to propagate. As for pn he will gladly repost totally contradictory opinions for the sake of his karma. He *doesn't care*.

I don't know how many times I have communicated my displeasure with pn's parasitism to him, but I most certainly intend to continue doing so. Now, as to pn's being a "friend of the workers", once more examine what he actually posts. In fact he has only *two* political views, maybe three if you include his use of 'free speech' as a defence after he offends people for totally non-political reasons.

These two views are 1) being in support of open immigration - which is ok **and** continued promotion of any and all free trade agreements which, of course **reduce wages** and not only in the wealthier countries but in the poorer countries that sign them. That's it. Nothing more. To misquote Churchill, "some living, some wage". The 'dialogue' about a 'living wage' is all over the internet, and you can easily find it. If you want to stick to reddit follow r/labor, r/progressive, r/demsocialist, any of the 'reform' socialist subreddits launched in disgust with the Stalinist influence at r/socialism or God knows how many more.

The last time pn and his habits were discussed on this board was about 3 months ago See http://www.reddit.com/r/AnarchistNews/comments/31hxwo/so_upostnationalist_seems_to_be_blatently? (The title continues "...spamming/trolling us at this point). A lot of the evidence presented there was in reference to my own posts, but at least one other person chimed in with how pn was "reposting his items **within seconds**" of his posting them. 

I said there what I said here today. I didn't care then about his copying in matters unconnected to the subreddit I am presently promoting. I, however, have opinions that I wish to promote, and unlike pn I have promoted these opinions for coming on 45 years *without any personal gain* and sometimes with personal loss. This sort of willingness to fight for a cause is alien to the mind of somebody like pn who is dedicated only to himself. If I was a better person I'd pity him, but my moral development isn't that high.

There is a simple solution for pn - if he ever stops acting like a two bit con man - in my case. He can post anything from me that is not connected with r/worldanarchism under the pretense he has found it and is familiar with it or even vaguely knowledgeable about the issues involved. When, however, he attempts to pretend concern about issues that are promoted by r/worldanarchism I *demand* proper credit **because** the causes promoted there are *very much not anything to do with any personal advantage of mine*.

That's it, except for the fact that it is a sign of maturity to not begin comments -even on the internet - with the words "fuck off".  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you had bothered to look it up rather than depending on your social circles you could have spared yourself a lot of embarrassment. Please try googling 'wu mao' to come upon the [following Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/50_Cent_Party) . To save you the trouble of reading the whole thing here is a relevant passage:

"*The term is derogatorily applied by cynical Chinese netizens to any person who blatantly expresses pro-Communist Party thoughts online.[4] However, there's another word "5 US cent ()" used by some pro-party netizens to denigrate anti-party, pro-democracy comments, with the implication that those commentators are hired by the governments of the United States, Taiwan or other "western" countries. Zhang Shengjun, a professor of international politics at Beijing Normal University published an article Who would be afraid of the cap of "50 Cent Party"? on the Chinese version of Global Times, claiming that spread by western media outfits, "it has become a baton waved towards all Chinese patriots" to make the Chinese government a constant target of criticism.[6][34]*"

[Here](https://chinese.yabla.com/chinese-english-pinyin-dictionary.php?define=wu+mao) is the dictionary definition where 'hairless' occurs. The tone of the words is different, but without the accents they are the same when transliterated into Latin script.

I think you are quite confused and very willing to leap into battle with imaginary Communists at the drop of a hat. To repeat myself, not *everyone* who brings up a piece of writing from China is therefore a supporter of its government.

	<TEXT> Look it up. You'll find that the term is indeed used by the two different groups. That is the irony of its use, and that is what is amusing to someone looking in on the way people use it. It seems there is some side taking here and both sides fail to comprehend that the vast majority of people are on neither side of their internet battle. 'Wu mao' as in hairless is a homonym in Pinyin just as "hare" and "hair" are in English. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I guess it's possible. Amethyst is basically silicon dioxide, and both silicon and oxygen are common elements on comets. The color comes from iron impurities, along with other transition elements, and there is no reason that these can't be present in at least small quantities on comets. On the other hand amethyst is a form of quartz which, on Earth at least, is a product of either igneous rock formation or hot springs. I don't think such conditions have ever been present in comet formation, though I am not expert enough to totally rule it out. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My opinion is that you should continue with the present format of both news and discussion. I have a low opinion of 'discussion' subs on reddit, and hopefully the presence of news anchors the discussion to something at least slightly connected to reality. There is presently another subreddit titled 'r/radicalfeminism' that is, if not dead, at least comatose. You might consider cpr for it if you are interested. Give it a good think first.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Interesting article. I note that the author is quite happy in quoting the 109 out of 201 members of the Syriza Central Committee who signed the statement against the government's acceptance of the EU terms. They are less forthcoming with the fact that the 39 MPs who didn't vote for the agreement were outnumbered by the rest of the 149 Syriza reps. Nor do they mention the fact that some of these 39 either abstained or were conveniently absent at the time of the vote.

 It's a normal human failing, selectively choosing the evidence, but it gives a distorted picture of the strength of the Syriza 'left'. It should also be pointed out that the author refers to *3* different oppositions within Syriza, 'Left Platform, Left Current' and 'Red Network'. The opposition to the 'moderates' in power within the party are anything but a united force. 

Personally I wouldn't hope for much success on their part. The difference between the numbers in the CC and the numbers in Parliament show one thing that anyone familiar with faction fighting in social democratic parties know. The winners, who are pretty well always on the right wing, have a clear realistic picture of what realpolitik it takes to win. They will set out to capture the important levers of power within the party. The leftist islands can be left for a later cleanup. The leftists, meanwhile, are almost always obsessed with having the 'correct program', the fine details of which they will argue endlessly about with each other while the world outside goes on. I wonder exactly how one is 'elected' to the CC of Syriza.

What happens in the next year will be interesting to watch. The situation is complex because not only is Syriza a coalition of factions but so are the oppositions, both inside and outside the party. For me it's like a refresher course, so to speak, of how social democratic parties operate internally.

 Given the relative youth of the party the controlling elements haven't had time to develop the usual unspoken levers of control that the right wing of such parties usually has - I "think", there may be routes of influence impossible to see from the outside or even to the 'inside' of nave but enthusiastic members unconnected with a faction. 

Syriza is also different from a lot of social democratic parties in the Anglosphere in that there is no 'two front battle' within affiliated unions. Or, to second guess myself again are there also union battlegrounds in those brought in by PASOK deserters to Syriza ? Watch these buggers. They are crafty indeed as the case of both Spain and France has shown. The bureaucrats are totally able to change their visible ideological clothes while never getting up from the desks they occupy.  </TEXT>

Even though present consensus says "no connection" there is a long standing dispute about pollutants from the tar sands and higher cancer rates downstream. As far as I can see the FN involved, Fort McMurray 468 First Nation, has sort of "made peace" with the oil companies, but the matter still simmers. The FN has a [Facebook Page](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Fort-McMurray-468-First-Nation/480886971005) which is presently not vehement on the matter, but should conditions change.... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I really don't know about the strength of the solar wind in the vicinity of Pluto though I suspect your statement has some merit. As to helium (and other gases) the molecules don't have to have the energy implied in 'escape velocity' to *gradually* be lost from a planet's atmosphere. All that is required is the kinetic energy needed to move "a little bit up" from a gravitational source (the planet). Given time the molecules gradually drift, bit by bit, away from the planet. With each tiny step the energy required to make the next one becomes less and less. I presume this is what you imply in your last statement. Release any gas at ground level and at least 'some' of it diffuses upward, gravity or not. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There are probably at least a few success stories, but I'm of the opinion that the overall picture isn't so pretty. At the time of the Haiti earthquake, and earlier after Hurricane Katrina, there was a lot of questioning about what was the best NGO to donate to. The Red Cross was definitely *not* one of them. There is a group, [Charity Navigator](http://www.charitynavigator.org) , that provides a good evaluation of various NGOs. </TEXT>

1)The IWW itself has a good history file with numerous items. See http://www.iww.org/history 

2)Jim Crutchfield's IWW Page. See http://www.workerseducation.org/crutch

3)University of Washington's 'Strike' page (mostly for the Pacific Northwest) See http://depts.washington.edu/labhist/encyclopedia/browse.shtml#iww

4)Marxists.org IWW file. See http://www.marxists.org/history/usa/unions/iww

5)Libcom has an archive of IWW pamphlets over the years. See https://libcom.org/exhaustive-list-iww-pamphlets  This file even contains G. Jewell's 1975 'History of the IWW in Canada'. People of my age may remember Jewell with less than total fondness.

6)I even found an online source for Fred Thompson's book on the history of the IWW. See http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015073497490;view=1up;seg=5 . Holy copyright violation Batman ! Get it while it's still up. An excellent book.

Hope this helps. B </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Actually postnationalism's personal sub for "anarchist stuff" is "postnationalist" rather than "postnationalism". I think he ran into trouble with the second title. He also has gained control of some other subreddits (he searches reddit for dead subs to take over) and has started at least one on his own. Postnationalist is far from being the most active or popular anarchist sub. That title is held, unfortunately, by r/anarchism from which postnationalism was banned a long time ago.

The guy is certainly in the running for the title of "Most Banned User on Reddit". The great majority of his bans have been for behavior that was in no sense 'political'. His case has been discussed before on this board.  I'll try and get back to this unpleasant subject later. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Enough is enough. I'm only tolerant up to a point. Some people will never learn. This post is yet another item copied from r/worldanarchism without either permission nor proper attribution by postnationalism. In this case his bot picked the item up **13 seconds** after I first posted it and reposted it here. 

I've made some unpleasant efforts to make this person see reason. As I said I don't care at all if he copies anything I post on reddit **except for** things that come from r/worldanarchism as that is a sub I wish to promote. So...to make myself totally clear **every single post on r/worldanarchism** is open for anyone to copy **except** for postnationalism. From this point forward anytime he does this it is understood that I have said "**no**" for all time. 

I am not the only person, and certainly not the most prolific one, that postnationalism parasites on. The main poster here, u/shatterededifice , will be copied on r/blackflag to the tune of 10 times for every time he copies me. That would be fine and good if postnationalism were to **ever** credit this board as the source of his material. Nope, he wants to pretend that he actually reads the items he posts or perhaps even glances at them. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't think so, but it could have been a contributing factor. Perhaps the FBI investigation may turn up something that suggests that the police knew something about the victim at some point. Even if they did, however, there is no guarantee that such facts can be found. Is each search in a police computer logged and saved ? I don't know. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well it may certainly be 'incomplete'. The thing is that it offers a metric that can be based on actual numbers. When you get into things like "importance" or "presentation" you enter a world of opinion rather than fact. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is an interesting article. By coincidence I have just finished reading a book on the founding of the Labour Party ie its 'prehistory'. Not that the analogy is totally the same, but said book shows how what was a very small minority eventually became a major political force. The path was complicated and devious, but reading about how such struggles overcame seemingly insurmountable obstacles shows that there is hope even if one is originally small. Different results this time I'm sure we all hope. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Maybe they do. Probably they don't. The two authors are the usual run-of-the-mill journalists. The vast majority of journalists who write for non-expert publications aren't closely connected, are not experts, to the fields they write about. People who write for Rolling Stone are only rarely musicians themselves. The only example to the contrary I can think of is 'Scientific American', and even they have to rely on regular science journalists rather than experts from time to time.

I'm sure that there are some things about the comics medium that you would have liked to have seen included. Can you explain. It might be interesting. As an old time comic collector I can say that the wider implications of the comic book world are interesting to me.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A few thoughts on the above:

1)I note with pleasure the end of paragraph ie "...with political unity in the organization but not necessarily full ideological unity". In this they, along with Embat and Apoyo Mutuo, seem to be following the lead of Latin American 'especifist' groups rather than the 'platformist' groups in Europe, North America and South Africa. Not that the platformists have ever been very successful in their quest for 'ideological unity'. In practice they have all been far more pluralistic than their goal of 'unity in theory' might suggest. Far more pluralistic, in fact, than their 'post-left' critics are. I have generally been supportive of the platformist efforts, but setting a goal of 'unity of thought' has always seemed counterproductive to me. Never mind that, for various reasons, it has proven to be impossible in practice - thank God.

2)These sort of organizations have set themselves the goal of being open and public. In this they differ from the still existing FAI of Spain which remains rather closed, and hasn't seemed to 'take off' in the way the anarchosyndicalist unions have. To my mind this is also very wise.

3)The problem of disorganization and a 'retreat from the world' that Aunar, Apoyo Mutuo and Embat complain of is actually far less prominent in Spain than amongst anarchists elsewhere. To see this problem in its full "*glory*' the comrades should look at the USA. There is a significant faction in American anarchism that seems quite determined to be as separate as possible from ordinary people whom they hold in great contempt. These people glory in their isolation, seeing it as some strange sign of superiority, and they do their damnedest to be as unappealing as possible. To them attempting to actual appeal to ordinary people is a grievous sign of not being radical enough - *and therefore not being superior enough*. Isolation is bad. Fooling yourself that it is good is worse. 

4) The Aunar document mentions the problem of a tendency to think in terms of 'grand abstractions' rather than whatever problems are at hand and can be at least partially solved. This has often been a problem amongst anarchists, and it's good to see it being addressed in an organized fashion. I hope they have the best of success. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's not like they are being 'voted on' by people from across the world, but government's do in fact react to the idea that they are being watched. If for no other reason than the fact that *all* governments contain factions that are in competition with each other, and sometimes the 'moderate' faction finds such exposure useful in the internal battles. No, the Sudanese government is not made up of 'nice people', but some are worse than others. </TEXT>
