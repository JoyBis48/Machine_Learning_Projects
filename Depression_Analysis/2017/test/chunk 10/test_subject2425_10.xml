	<TEXT> At first I took offense for your comment, but in reality I shouldn't. You are absolutely correct that it is my fault for not taking the time to learn to read a book right. Upon further research, it isn't just me. The screw tape letters is just a hard book to comprehend, and that is the case with a lot of college freshman (based on amazon book reviews).
I'm not trying to stray off from the fact that you are correct about my laziness, but upon further inspection of your profile comments, you are just a redditor that takes satisfaction in humiliating others. Every other comment on your profile is mean and negative.  

Edit: Also, I made it pretty clear that it was a bad decision of mine to do what I did. I didn't ask for you to reiterate it. I asked if there were discussion groups for particular books where people like me can ask questions. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So, r/books, I am going to be 100% honest. I have never read a book in middle school or high school. I used spark notes for all of my quizzes and tests. This is now coming back to haunt me, but for the most part I am understanding The Golden String ( an autobiography). However, The screw tape letters is the most confusing thing I have ever tried to comprehend in my life. I know it is a pretty popular book, but for the life of me I have to study each and every sentence. What should I do? Are there any discussion groups that are linked to a book you are reading? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It would be a lot more than a $2,000 payday, you are thinking of the on contract price of a phone ($99-199). A new iPhone 6/6 plus sells for ~ 500-700 dollars on eBay. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am against a lot of the things in the show, but Transparent on amazon prime had an amazing pilot that had me hooked. Also, the youtube series called "theater class" is another one (a bit old) that had me hooked.

	<TEXT> For some reason, this is the first comment on reddit that I have laughed at in a long time. Just imagining that shit flying off in the distance without your control makes me giggle.
