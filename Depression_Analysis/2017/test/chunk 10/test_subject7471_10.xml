Even if you ignore this, animal agriculture has a huge contribution to global warming, leads to large amounts of nitrate runoff, and uses a disproportionate amount of water and other resources. Even if you completely ignore the harm to non-human animals there are substantial impacts to other humans to consider. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Just imagine if we allowed experimenting on humans without their consent though. We could very likely have expanded that age even further.

Nonetheless, (I hope) you would be on the side protesting against that. Extending life for some is great, but cannot be justified at any cost.

Our society does not yet fairly factor in the complex and sophisticated interests and lives possessed by many other animals when deciding how we allow them to be treated. If we were to give just consideration to other animals we would find that many of the experiments we conduct today still would not be justified. We would also need to acknowledge that the animals being raised for food on contemporary farms, and animals being used for entertainment in circuses or zoos are also facing a brutal injustice. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  If you take out factory farming, the numbers change considerably. Just because the most popular method for producing meat is harmful doesn't mean they all are. Here is a detailed article going into depth on why pasture grazing is needed. Pasture grazing creates critical habitat for many species.

The reason these cruel factory farms exist is because they are efficient. Yes, there may be more diversity when allowing cattle to graze on uncultivated grasslands, but it comes at a far larger cost of land, and [higher greenhouse gas emissions](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2535638/):

Adding the carbon debt resulting from the additional cleared land required by the two-thirds less efficient grass finishing process (26.6 million acres  10,400 lb/acre/year, or 276.6 billion lb/year) results in the organic system totaling 770 billion lb of CO2-equivalent GHG emissions; or 58% higher than the conventional systems total of 487.5 billion lb. </TEXT>

Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence, and for athletes.

Similarly, the [British Dietetic Association](https://www.bda.uk.com/foodfacts/vegetarianfoodfacts) describes veganism as a type of vegetarian diet and continues:

Well planned vegetarian diets can be both nutritious and healthy. They have been associated with lower risks of heart disease, type 2 diabetes, obesity, certain types of cancer and lower blood cholesterol levels.

Well planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for all stages of life.

The position of the Australian Government's [National Health and Medical Research Council](http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/_files_nhmrc/publications/attachments/n55_australian_dietary_guidelines_130530.pdf) is that:

Appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthy and nutritionally
adequate. Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the lifecycle.

Finally the [Dietitians of Canada](http://www.dietitians.ca/Nutrition-Resources-A-Z/Factsheets/Vegetarian/Eating-Guidelines-for-Vegans.aspx) state:

A vegan eating pattern has many potential health benefits. They include lower rates of obesity, heart disease, high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes and certain types of cancer. Other benefits include lower blood cholesterol levels and a lower risk for gallstones and intestinal problems.

This eating pattern can take some extra planning. Vegans must make sure that enough nutrients like protein, iron, zinc, calcium, vitamins D and B12 and omega-3 fats are included.

A well planned vegan diet can meet all of these needs. It is safe and healthy for pregnant and breastfeeding women, babies, children, teens and seniors. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> But what if, like the REG article states, it is possible to get much more money donated to the groups ACE recommends by donating to ACE, which will then get many other people to donate to the charities they recommend?

For instance: Donating $1000 towards the staff of a meta-charity may generate several thousand dollars of direct donations that would not have been made otherwise, or would have gone to less cost-effective interventions. Instead of donating my money towards helping people directly and thus creating one additional direct donor, I might be able to create many direct donors by going meta and donating towards the promotion of charitable giving.

GiveWell, whose main meta-activity is cost-effectiveness research, tracks their money moved. If we compare this amount to all their expenses so far, we get a fund ratio thats in the ballpark of 30:1, too. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> **Ingredients**

* 1 can chickpeas, reserving a small handful for the avocado cream (you can cook dried ones as well)
* 3 cloves garlic
* 1 small onion
* 2 teaspoons ground cumin
* A BIG bunch of both fresh parsley and coriander
* Salt and pepper
* 2 Tablespoons olive oil
* 3/4 cup chickpea flour (sometimes called gram flour)
* Burger buns and fresh tomato for serving

**For the avocado cream and tahini mayo**

* 1 avocado
* A small handful chickpeas left from can
* A bunch of fresh parsley
* 1 garlic clove
* 2 tablespoons tahini
* The juice of one lemon
* 2 tablespoons water

**Directions**

Throw your chickpeas, peeled garlic, onion, cumin and salt and pepper into a food processor and pulse until roughly blended. Youll need to scrape down the sides. Now add in the fresh herbs, oil and flour and blend until you have a nice thick texture, but it will still be fairly moist. Place into a bowl and if you need, add a little more flour to help the mixture bind as you form them into the patties. Make them small or big as you prefer. In a flat frying pan, heat about half an inch of oil over medium to high and add in your burgers. Cook for about 4 -5 minutes on both sides and once they are on their second turn, press them gently to make them flatter if you need. They should turn a nice dark, golden brown and smell divine!

For the avocado cream, simply add to your processor the avocado (without skin of course!), the remaining chickpeas, parsley and 1 garlic clove and blend until smooth. For the tahini mayo, drop the two tablespoons of tahini into a small bowl with the lemon juice and water and whisk with folk until you have a creamy consistency.

Toast the bun, add the burger, then the avocado, then a slice of tomato and finish with the oozy, lovely tahini mayo! </TEXT>

One thing you may find helpful is to commit to going vegan a day or two a week at first. That way you can find new foods that you enjoy without cutting everything else out at once. From there it becomes much easier to be vegan another day per week until you get up to full time! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Avoiding animal products does not limit someone to a single dietary option. You still have a huge diversity of foods to choose from. You can still mix up your ratios of macro nutrients to cover any extreme or anywhere in the middle. You can still eat low or high calorie, target specific micro nutrients, avoid sugar or eat lots of it. 

Being vegan isn't a single diet plan. It is a choice people make to behave in a way that causes less harm to others, but that doesn't mean removing any aspect of choice from our lives. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think this is one more important step to getting people to change their eating habits. People are aware of the terrible cruelty to animals that happens on these farms. People are increasingly becoming aware of the large environmental impact of raising animals for food (not just in terms of global warming but they also require a lot of water and produce a lot of waste, far more than we could ever appropriately use as fertilizer, which leads to runoff, pollution of drinking water, and dead zones). People know that there are many healthier and often more affordable alternatives to animal products available. People are increasingly worried about antibiotic resistant bacteria and other health hazards created by factory farms. Adding this outbreak will only hasten the shift toward alternatives.

Per capita meat consumption in the US is down by about 10% since 2007. People do care about the huge negative consequences of animal agriculture, and within the next 10-20 years we will see some substantial progress. </TEXT>

I'm not dating anyone now, so no success story for me, but that is probably my fault more than OKCupid's. It also means you can find me on there if you want to ask me out ;-). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> **[American Dietetic Association](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19562864)**

 It is the position of the American Dietetic Association that appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases. Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence, and for athletes.

**[Dietitians of Canada](http://www.dietitians.ca/Nutrition-Resources-A-Z/Factsheets/Vegetarian/Eating-Guidelines-for-Vegans.aspx)**

 A well planned vegan diet can meet all of these needs. It is safe and healthy for pregnant and breastfeeding women, babies, children, teens and seniors.

**[The British National Health Service](http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/Vegetarianhealth/Pages/Vegandiets.aspx)**

 With good planning and an understanding of what makes up a healthy, balanced vegan diet, you can get all the nutrients your body needs.

**[The British Nutrition Foundation](http://www.nutrition.org.uk/publications/briefingpapers/vegetarian-nutrition)**

 A well-planned, balanced vegetarian or vegan diet can be nutritionally adequate ... Studies of UK vegetarian and vegan children have revealed that their growth and development are within the normal range.

**[The Dietitians Association of Australia](http://daa.asn.au/for-the-public/smart-eating-for-you/nutrition-a-z/vegan-diets/)**

 Vegan diets are a type of vegetarian diet, where only plant-based foods are eaten. They differ to other vegetarian diets in that no animal products are usually consumed or used. Despite these restrictions, with good planning it is still possible to obtain all the nutrients required for good health on a vegan diet.

**[The United States Department of Agriculture](http://www.choosemyplate.gov/healthy-eating-tips/tips-for-vegetarian.html)**

 Vegetarian diets (*see context*) can meet all the recommendations for nutrients. The key is to consume a variety of foods and the right amount of foods to meet your calorie needs. Follow the food group recommendations for your age, sex, and activity level to get the right amount of food and the variety of foods needed for nutrient adequacy. Nutrients that vegetarians may need to focus on include protein, iron, calcium, zinc, and vitamin B12.

**[The National Health and Medical Research Council](http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/_files_nhmrc/publications/attachments/n55a_australian_dietary_guidelines_summary_130530.pdf)**

 Alternatives to animal foods include nuts, seeds, legumes, beans and tofu. For all Australians,
these foods increase dietary variety and can provide a valuable, affordable source of protein
and other nutrients found in meats. These foods are also particularly important for those who
follow vegetarian or vegan dietary patterns. Australians following a vegetarian diet can still meet nutrient requirements if energy needs are met and the appropriate number and variety of serves from the Five Food Groups are eaten throughout the day. For those eating a vegan diet, supplementation of B12 is recommended.

**[The Mayo Clinic](http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-living/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/vegetarian-diet/art-20046446)**

  A well-planned vegetarian diet (*see context*) can meet the needs of people of all ages, including children, teenagers, and pregnant or breast-feeding women. The key is to be aware of your nutritional needs so that you plan a diet that meets them.

**[The Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada](http://www.heartandstroke.com/site/c.ikIQLcMWJtE/b.3484249/k.2F6C/Healthy_living__Vegetarian_diets.htm)**

 Vegetarian diets (*see context*) can provide all the nutrients you need at any age, as well as some additional health benefits. </TEXT>
