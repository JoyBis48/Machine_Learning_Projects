	<TITLE> 5 Things Productive People Do Each Day </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-07-06 15:56:39 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> [Source](http://www.azsmartoffice.com/articles/2015/top-5-things-productive-people-do-each-day)

We all want to get more things done in less time. With all the distractions we have each day that is an increasingly more difficult aspect of our careers to work on. After having a couple kids and taking on more work than ever before, here are the top 5 things I do each day to ensure maximum productivity and minimum insanity.

##1. Stick to a Sleep Schedule
We all know that sleep is important, but if you don't believe me you can see what the [Mayo Clinic in Scottsdale](http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/adult-health/in-depth/sleep/art-20048379) has to say about sleep. Make sure you are setting a sleep schedule and sticking to it to ensure you are getting the right amount. Go to bed and wake up at the same time every day. That means weekends and holidays too. Many experts agree that [consistency is important](http://www.inc.com/eric-v-holtzclaw/consistency-power-success-rules.html), so make sure you are being consistent with your sleep habits. Being consistent reinforces your body's sleep-wake cycle and helps promote better sleep at night. 

##2. Pay Attention to Your Diet
You literally are what you eat. food is fuel, and the kinds of foods and drinks you consume determine the types of nutrients in your system and impact how well your mind and body are able to function. That sugar and caffeine filled can might give you a quick short boost of energy, but is 15 minutes all the time you need? Try drinking a large glass of water first and see if that helps you feel better and wake up. [A symptom of dehydration is tiredness](http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/dehydration/basics/symptoms/con-20030056).

##3. Focus Your Mind
Meditation is not a luxury like a reflexology foot massage. Its a way to disconnect from everyday stresses, if only for a few minutes a day. You deserve to feel good, to have the energy you want to enjoy life, to be healthy and happy. Start living the life you were meant to live. Learn to meditate.  Dr. Marcia Hootman

There are [many benefits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_on_meditation) that come when you take the time to practice some sort of meditation, from increased focus to more happieness. It is understandable to be afraid of somethign you haven't tried before, especially something as personal as meditation. Being quiet and alone with yourself can be scary, it's one of the reasons why our society is so obsessed with technology, entertainment and distractions. We are afraid of our true selves. Once you are able to build up the will power to overcome that fear you will put yourself on a path to greater mental focus and productivity.

Reddit has many great resources like r/mindfulness and r/meditation if you want to learn more.

##4. Set Goals

By [setting goals](http://www.codeofliving.com/articles/5-powerful-reasons-why-goal-setting-important) we give ourselves focus and a way to measure our progress during the day. Having daily goals is a great way to remain undistracted, help us overcome procrastination and motivate us to succeed.

Goals are what take us forward in life; they are the oxygen to our dreams. They are the first steps to every journey we take and are also our last. Its very important that you realize the significance and importance of goal-setting and apply this knowledge in your life."

##5. Make Email More Productive
Ever been overwhelmed by emails at work? Experts report billions of emails are sent every day and they're still increasing. With so many messages arriving throughout the day, email can easily become a continual interruption and distraction from getting real work accomplished. Try some useful tips like scheduling time for email and only working on them during that specified time, use the subject line only for quick messages, and replace large Word and PowerPoint file attachments with PDFs.

Our work and our lives are better when we are more productive, less stressed and able to use our time more effectively. By setting a consistent sleep schedule, maintaining a healthy diet, exploring meditation and your own mind, taking the time to set and track goals and finding better ways to manage your email you will be on a path to a more productive life. I'm not saying that these things won't take practice and some work on your part, but the reward is well worth the effort involved. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As long as you're willing to continue learning and put in real work and effort, anything is possible. Even doing your own SEO.

There are lots of fun things to learn to be good at SEO. Skills like research, strategizing, writing, reputation management, networking, web design and more. The sidebar of this subreddit has lots of great resources. Moz has a ton of great stuff on their blog as does searchengineland. 

The benefits of hiring a professional are the same as with any job or task. If you hire someone who knows what they are doing, who will create a marketing strategy for you with a way to measure results and tweak your plan, you will hit the ground running and benefit from the professional's many years of experience and expertise.  </TEXT>

You know when you're going to have a tough day, and remembering not to beat yourself up about it is so important. It's tough having a growth mindset all the time, thanks for the reminder :) </TEXT>
