	<TEXT> What I don't understand is why so many people are so eager to be aggressors. I mean, look at all the facts and avoid war at all costs, right? Even lower- and middle-class people get behind these aggressive ideas (people who have absolutely nothing to gain from war). It's disheartening. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I keep seeing "illegal is illegal" and "they have to follow the law just like everyone else" as rebuttals to sympathizers of illegal immigrants. That's nonsense. Maybe the problem *IS* the law. Slavery was once legal, soooo

Not to mention the fact that many immigrants are just trying to survive and we have all these right-wing assholes obsessed with deportation and protecting the Mexican border (also nonsense).

Only argument I can maybe understand is that illegal immigration facilitates more criminal activity? By allowing criminals into the country? I think "it hurts our economy" is also another argument, but how? On the grand scale, how?

Someone please explain the mindset to me. </TEXT>
