	<TEXT> I have a daughter.  She's now in her 30s, but when she was younger, she wanted to "model".  I got her an agent and a manager.  She did a few photoshoots, and got a couple local tv spots, soon got tired of it and went on with her life.  She's nurse manager at a hospital in Atlanta, GA now.

Let this be a lesson to all of you.  Always hire professionals, never do anything without a signed contract up front, a deposit and a lawyer's blessing.  Work with a legitimate agent and manager.  Communicate with everyone you know about what your plans are.  Leave your cell phone number, itinerary with your manager and check in ever 30 minutes when on a "shoot".  Never travel alone to a shoot.  Always go with a friend, your agent, a parent, a trusted companion.  Always have a backup "plan b" incase it goes wrong. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think cheating is wrong, but I don't think society should punish cheaters, rather I think it's up to the couple to question the reason why they are together, and be honest about it.

For example, my wife and I lived together for almost 8 years before we were married.  I was working at the military base and a teaching hospital in Seoul, South Korea.  We enjoyed being together.  We had lots of sex, traveled all over the world and rarely ever talked about marriage and children.  Eventually, we decided we were ready to talk about children and then we formed a legal bond in order to protect them (we got married).  We had five children together, one died in a car accident in 1995.  We have three sons and one daughter, and seven grandchildren.  I'm not saying ours was the way to do it, just saying that if you're up front with the person you are with about what you hope to get out of the relationship (sex, partnership, money, security, family, travel partner, etc), then you will last longer.  We've been married 29 years! </TEXT>

The Fed buys all the stuff and rebates all the coupon income back to the US Treasury

It doesn't matter if rates go sky high. The Treasury issues the debt, the Fed buys it coining new money (digital form) receives the interest income and turns around and hands it right back to the Treasury.

A closed and nested circle jerk.

This is not an assumption, guess or proposal, it's how the thing really works.

	<TEXT> 63 year old MD here (raises hand).  Dieting doesn't work long term.  If you want to see your daughter all grown up, the #1 best thing for you is walking.  Every day.  60 minutes or more.  Uphill.  Get your heart rate up to 150 or more.  If you want, you can try to keep your calorie intake down to 2,000 a day.

1. Breakfast is the most important meal of the day.  Make instant oatmeal cereal (get the bucket of plain oatmeal, cook it in a little pot, covered with water.  you can toss in a handful of nuts (protein) and raisins (sweetener).  Serve it with plain nonfat yogurt and fresh fruit.  Water for beverage.

2.  Lunch: skinless/boneless chicken or turkey is easy to cook - get the breasts or leg pieces, throw a few in a pan with olive oil, garlic or onion and mix up a big bowl of salad greens, fresh tomato, cukes, shaved carrots, whatever you like.  Put the chicken on top and serve with home-made salad dressing.  I take a bowl and mix 1/3 cider vinegar (or red wine vinegar), 2/3 extra virgin olive oil, 1 tsp onion powder, "italian seasonings" to taste, mustard and salt to taste.  Takes 2 minutes to make and tastes delicious.  Beverage: water.

3.  Dinner.  Something light - soba noodles with veggies is a personal favorite, or kimbap or even bibimbap.  Beverage: water or a glass of red wine.  Dessert: fruit.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I remember when the internet started.  I got my first desktop computer in 1987.  It was an 80/88 with dual 5.25" floppy drives, no hard drive and ran DOS.  My brother in law at the time gave me a 500mb hard drive for my birthday and helped me install it.  It came with a 13" color monitor.  A couple years later, I "upgraded" to a 386 with GEOS gui OS.  Kind of like Windows, but cuter.  It came with AOL, which, at the time, was the only way to get online.  

A lot has changed in the years since.  I think the #1 thing I disliked from the beginning was any spam or advertising.  You could see it from a distance and avoid it pretty easily back then.  When the first adblockers came out (they were individual programs you had to install on your hard drive), I used them all.  Now you can easily install extensions in Firefox and Chrome and there are dozens to choose from...also blocking facebook and google tracking, hiding your IP/Location and much more.  I use them all.  I don't want to be tracked or sold to.  Never did and that is never going to change. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is why I don't like most redditors like you.  They jump to conclusions and never give anyone the benefit of the doubt.

Take this whole Ellen Pao thing.  Someone didn't have the whole story, but made up the parts they didn't know about (that Pao fired Virginia), the whole site blew up and everyone was against her, forcing her to resign.  Turns out it was someone else named Alexis who fired Virginia, and it had nothing to do with Pao.

Keep it up.  You're what's shitty about the world today. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Benjamin Fulford talked a lot about this on his blog 5 or 10 years ago.    Just do a Startpage search for "benjamin fulford new world order putin china brics" and you'll see the articles I'm talking about.

This was planned all along.  

But what does it matter?  Unless you're the CEO of a major corporation, or a the head of a Union or something, there's not much you can do and it won't affect you all that much.

I'm assuming most of you guys are young, probably in your 20s, maybe 30s, correct?  I'll be 65 in 2 years and then I'll retire and be on my merry way.  I guess if you're under 30, you'll be living in an interesting time.  You'll be seeing some strange things happening in the market.

Me on the other hand, I'll be dead. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Millenials (people born after 1985) are living at home with mom and dad.  They are not buying homes and they don't have good jobs.  They have HUGE student loan payments/debt and almost zero cash flow.  That means they are not buying cars or refrigerators or any of the big ticket items.

And the boomers (people born 1945-1963) are dying off.  By 2020, almost 76,000,000 people will be unable to make any sort of large purchases...

That leaves people born between 1964-1985, sometimes called Generation X.  This is the generation that can afford to buy stuff.  And there's only 82,000,000 of you.

The American birth rate is way down.  Millenials can't afford to leave mom and dad's homes, they can't get married and they don't have jobs.  That means they are not having kids.

We're shit out of luck unless we do something drastic. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I wonder to what extent was Ellen aware that they were using her as a scapegoat?  She seemed genuinely distraught about the result of all of this.  She replied to my first message, but not my second, which means she's probably quit Reddit altogether, and who can blame her?  I doubt she'll be back.  I didn't read all of the vitriol posted about her, but I guarantee you, even an old fart like me would be devastated if even a percentage of that were directed at me!

As to your comment about her being an Asian and Female, I remember early articles where details about her relationship with a married "black" male were cooked up.  This is meant to light a fire in certain circles where Asians and Blacks should never mix.  To a skeptic like me, this kind of negative press early on set the stage for people's dislike for her, that somehow she was not to be trusted.  Of course they presented no evidence in these articles.  And I prefer to give people the benefit of the doubt. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Obviously I believe you're incorrect, otherwise I wouldn't have posted it.  I'm hardly a troll.  I think it's a genuine question that a lot of people think.  For those of you who are not aware, 84% of American citizens are religious, something like 79% of them are Christians.  That's 286 million Christians in the US alone.  I guarantee you, ever single one of them is asking this question.

Now you may think they are nuts, silly, or just plain wrong, and I would agree with you generally.  But how are you going to change their minds?  

It's a topic worth discussing in greater detail and just removing my post because you think it's "trolling" or "disrespectful" just buries a potentially worth-while discussion in my personal and professional opinion!   </TEXT>
