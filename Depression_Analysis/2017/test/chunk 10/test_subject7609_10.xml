	<TEXT> Brooks is saying that Coates negative view of American history is wrong (point #2, ""I think you distort American history"), and that even if he is actually right, stop to stop his complaining (point #4). Then he has the gall (point #6) to claim that Coates' writing is actually hurting the country/American dream.

Brooks isn't wrong per say, just missing the point, and straw-manning. Brooks did not need to point out the obvious fact that "White America's not all bad!" It's hardly a review - it's just smug condescension from his ivory tower.

	<TEXT> interesting take on american psycho [here:](https://italkyoubored.wordpress.com/2011/10/20/american-psycho-maybe-not-the-book-you-think-it-is/)

A two decade old novel might seem appropriate now, of haves in glass towers and have nots protesting in the streets, a book which is supposedly either a literal story of an investment banker who is a serial killer, or an investment banker who only imagines that he kills a series of men and women, his murder spree a metaphor for his professions indifference to larger society and the damage he does to it. Curious about whether this book would shed light on the turmoil now, I found a third theme  the book is a cryptomorph, its subject neither mass murder, or a metaphor for the financial world, but about being gay and closeted during the first years of the AIDS outbreak. This is not a case of a symbolic undercurrent; almost all the male characters, including Patrick Bateman and Timothy Price are gay closeted men, with that aspect of their lives, off-stage and unspoken directly of, but most certainly there.

	<TEXT> Harry Crews is a master and virtually unknown. *Feast of Snakes* is a good place to start but everything I've read by him has been unreal.

If you like southern gothic - Larry Brown, William Gay, Flannery Oconnor, Faulkner, etc, you should give Crews a try, although he is very different from all in his own way.

Nice article on him from the millions: http://www.themillions.com/2012/04/harry-crews-and-the-death-of-southern-literature.html </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not arguing that, I think it's just a fact that this is a win-win situation for Cruz.

What I'm saying is that the NYT can't simply claim it has sources that show manipulation through bulk sales in the face of multiple other sources/newspapers contradicting that statement, and expect to come out of the situation unharmed (whether it be public opinion, integrity, litigation, etc) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm pretty sure the word is not solely reserved for legal matters...

If you're going to exclude a politically charged book on the basis of bulk sales without providing evidence, it's going to cause a media frenzy. Your publication gets some unfavorable opinions printed about it, Cruz gets to drive home the point that the liberal media has an unfair bias against him, and sales are driven for the book you took off your list for cheating in the first place.

	<DATE> 2015-07-07 20:25:02 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm looking for help in upgrading this machine I ordered pre-built a year ago. I've built a machine before, but ordered this prebuilt because I had very little time to do the research/work. I mostly play indie and 4x games that aren't too graphically intensive, but I'm looking to upgrade for Fallout 4 (and Witcher 3 probably while I'm at it).

Looking to drop maybe a few hundred on what's likely a new graphics card, unless you build gurus feel otherwise. Can probably wait until November to do this if there's something to wait for. Apologies if this is the wrong place. I appreciate the help.

Basic specs:

AMD FX-Series FX-6300 (3.50GHz)

16GB DDR3 1TB HDD

Windows 8.1 64-Bit

NVIDIA GeForce GT 740 4GB

	<TEXT> The book is alright I guess. Chuckled here and there, didn't feel too strongly either way about it. You're correct in that it's pretty much a poor man's Vonnegut. It has the absurdist humor, but is kind of lacking the trademark Vonnegut worldview/philosophy.  Haven't seen the movie.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Here's my humble advice as a dad of a four and two year old:

Don't worry so much about *which* books to get. You will probably end up with a book overload from friends and family from gifts and hand me downs. My kids like books like *Where the Wild Things Are*, Mercer Meyer's *Little Critter* series, Dr. Seuss books, etc, but the books themselves aren't that important. (Edit: u/wjbc's list is great... very similar to what we read in our home)

Focus on making the books fun for your kids. Picture books are much better than reading them things for older kids like Harry Potter, as they can point things out, and you can ask them to find certain things ("Where's the frog on this page"). Interactivity is also pretty key - taking an imaginary apple from the page and eating it, doing wacky voices, dances to certain parts, stupid things like that.

Also, you'll be reading some of these books hundreds to thousands of times, so pick something you can have fun with as well.

Finally, most important piece of advice! Start reading the day your new baby comes home and do it every day! So important, develops vocabularly, letter and color recognition, and hopefully a lifelong love of learning. Good luck! </TEXT>
