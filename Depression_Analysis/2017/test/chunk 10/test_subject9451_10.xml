	<TEXT> I can't believe it! This solves every problem I've been having, especially with my boobs! Since starting keto, I've had to put ice packs on my chest every shark week and taking off my bra has become the *worst* part of my day.

Thank you so much for this, can't eat to try it! </TEXT>

They do serve alcohol at French Press, at least in the form of bloody Mary's and mimosas. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Everyone is going to say French Press but I found it horribly overpriced and the food was terrible. I was with a group of 6 people when I went. We all got different meals and sampled from one another's plate and agreed the only decent thing on the table was my god son's flapjacks.

It cost $40 for just my husband and myself to eat.

Another Broken Egg is fantastic and reasonably priced, but it's incredibly packed on the weekend mornings so get there early. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> ZERO Carb Protein Powder </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-05-31 20:24:02 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> My husband is also on keto but is weight lifting to build muscle. As many of you know, this can cause some problems in the muscle-growth department. Also, I have a nasty habit of not eating breakfast, and after being at work for a few hours I cave and eat cashews from a vending machine.


So he did a lot of research and found [Isopure](http://www.theisopurecompany.com/product/isopurezerocarb.html), an incredible low/zero carb protein powder that we could both drink in the morning without throwing our carbs off for the day.


The only one I've found in store that really has any carbs are the chocolate flavors, and they're 1 net carb per 2 scoops. All others (that I'm aware of) are zero carbs per two scoops. 


If you aren't used to protein powder, the taste *will* throw you off, but you can acquire a taste for it. The flavors themselves are very good (my current favorite is Strawberries and Cream), but there is a very noticeable metallic after taste due to he other ingredients. I find it's best to have my coffee ready in the morning and drink a cup after I drink the powder.


The only true downside is the price. ~~The smaller "sample" bags are about $25, and depending on the flavor you can get 1 or 3 pound cans. I'm not sure on the price of the 1 pound cans, but I know the 3 pound is $60.~~


If you have any questions, I'll do my best to answer them. Hope this helps!

EDIT: I just checked Amazon, and the prices are apparently much better than in-store or I just got the prices totally wrong.

Example: 3 pound can of Mint Chocolate Chip 0g Carbs = $42.79 ($14.26 / Pound) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Congratulations and welcome to Onederland!! Other people seem to know everything about weight loss, regardless if they've actually done the work to lose a large amount of weight and if they have, not one thing works for everyone. Good for you for sticking to your guns when you could have easily given up. </TEXT>

I've been on Keto for for exactly 6 weeks today and I'm back in the 100's for the first time since August 2014!!

Since March 8th I've lost 19 lbs on the nose which is just unreal, both because of the short time and the fact that I used to be a die hard carb addict.

Here's the thing: I "cheat". Ive had a few slices of pizza, I've been eating chocolate since Easter, and I eat things without logging them first and later regret it when I do log it, thinking my whole day is ruiuned.
But I KCKO, and I never once got "kicked out of keto." I kept losing weight. When you have a bad day, don't freak out and give up. KCKO is a saying around here for a reason!! Even if you screw up, DON'T GIVE UP!! You are still going to do great. The only way you won't reach your goal is if you quit trying.

I know it's hard when you're having a bad day, so look at some progress pics (yours or others), maybe plan what your next few meals will be, relax, and have faith in the system and the system will take care of you.

Lastly, and most important; please don't let the scale define your self worth. The scale is a 4 digit representation of your relationship with gravity. Losing weight is fantasict for your overall health and can make you so much more confident but no matter what it says, you must believe you are an amazing, beautiful person because YOU ARE!! 

Good luck, I hope you reach every goal you've set for yourself and live a healthy, happy life! </TEXT>
