	<TEXT> They're a tartare mixture, one with tuna the other with salmon. They have a little fish roe, Japanese mayo and some crunchy tempura bits. We would have added some scallions if we'd had any. The only reason they're not sitting on rice is because we ran out.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not planning to upgrade the portrait lens at this point. The results from that, little inexpensive lens are astounding.  Really I'm looking for a telephoto lens and potentially a wide angle. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The biggest thing that I'm lacking is zoom.  My kids are getting older and I need to be able to take some sport action shots from a distance.

I'm currently using the Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 portrait lens quite a bit, but I do use the 18-55mm when I need it. </TEXT>
