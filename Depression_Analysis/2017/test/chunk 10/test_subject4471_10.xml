Additionally, since you want to model human figures like in that drawing you linked, learn how to DRAW human anatomy decently before learning to model the human body. It will make your work much more accurate. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If someone asked your male friends "Would you have sex with whitestadultyouknow?" 9/10 will say yes. The 1 left is lying or gay.

But if someone asked you "Would you have sex with x y or z (your male friends)?" you would likely answer no (or correct me if I am wrong).

That makes it inherently a one-sided friendship. The man wants it to become sexual, but you do not. Friendships between men are two-sided; neither of them wants sex, since they're hetero. They simply enjoy each other's company and are not expecting anything more from the relationship. It is a more "pure" kind of relationship, since both parties are upfront about what they want from the other person - just friendship.

 I'm an amazing friend to those who deserve it.

How modest. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>   I think my generation is a bunch of pansies and complainers

Agree entirely.

Good lord, the amount of people my age (I am in my mid-20s) who complain about not being able to find a job is staggering. Take a shit job and suck it up until you build some experience. Holy shit, they're practically giving jobs away in Alberta right now (I am Canadian). I never see the Chinese, Indian or other foreign students/20-year-olds complaining about a shitty job at McDonalds. They recognize they got to do hard work and put up with shit; they're not pampered. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I wish you luck, but maybe the reason more women aren't interested in you is because you sound incredibly generic. "Funny, nerdy, normal" is all we know about you. Funny and normal are essentially requirements for even friendships...try telling more positive, unique traits about yourself.

And I don't mean "I also like movies and music." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Additionally, find a GOOD 3D modeler on YouTube and watch his/her other videos. I am in school and have access to Digital Tutors and other professional tutorial sites; about 2/3 of the "tutorials" on YouTube are absolute garbage in comparison but there are some good channels out there. </TEXT>
