	<TEXT> I used to always be one to check a movies rotten tomatoes score, or my favorite critic's reviews before seeing a film, but I've found that when doing so, It can alter my expectations for a film before seeing it. So now I stay away, but I have seen films that I normally wouldn't have watched if not for the positive reception they received. So, what are your views on this subject?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Could be about anything from Comic Con really, for me, Henry Cavill doesn't feel enough like Superman for me right now, maybe because I thought Man of Steel was just okay, but I wish he had a stronger presence I guess, anyone agree? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think my only problem with the trailer is that Superman didn't talk once (unless he did as Clark Kent in the one scene with Fishburne). After Man of Steel, Superman doesn't feel like that strong of a character, hopefully he can redeem himself in this movie but it may be hard due to all the new characters. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> BUT WE HAVE KOBE AND CLARKSON! Guess who hasn't been winning with that backcourt (I know Kobe's been injured), Kobe's got limited time left in the league, and who better to mentor our new young guard. Hopefully we pickup a free agent big to provide a decent season, plus Okafor is basically Brook Lopez without the jumpshot range, good but won't take you to the next level, In Mitch We Trust. </TEXT>
