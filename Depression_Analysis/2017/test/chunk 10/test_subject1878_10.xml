	<TEXT> Really? You don't think vaccine deniers should be dismissed? Flat earthers should be given just as much credence as rounders? Phrenologists and psychologists put on equal footing? 

Scientific debates don't care about your feelings and if you're offended. It cares about evidence. And those who refuse to examine it, and deny the reality of scientific evidence are in denial. Coddling them just devalues the meaning of "skepticism."  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> And? 

Had they happened in a warmer world, they would have been even worse. The point is that climate change amplifies the impacts, and without it Sandy wouldn't have been as damaging. 

It's pretty simple logic. Just because something happened naturally in the past doesn't mean man can't influence how it happens in the present. 

There were forest fires before humans existed. Does that mean humans can't start forest fires?  </TEXT>

citation needed.

If I turn the temperature of my freezer up .55 degrees is my ice cream going to melt?

And if you turn it up .55F again tomorrow? And the next day? And then turn it up .65F the day after? And then .75f? 

Because this warming hasn't ended. And with the CO2 we've already released, won't end for thousands of years.

But the natural warming that would be taking us out of it takes hundreds of thousands of years to acheive the temperature changes we're experiencing in just decades. So no, it's not natural.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Uh, yeah, if you're going to accuse NOAA, NASA, et al of being so bad at science that their corrections to the record are actually not correct at all, nothing I can say will change your mind. 

The fact is in the past things were measured differently (i.e. using buckets scooped from boats vs engine intake suction, or the biggest difference was when in the day measurements were taken. Morning and afternoon temperatures are pretty different, after all, and correcting for that takes no small amount of time or effort.) 

Updating and correcting for those errors is an ongoing process. Science is iterative, not conclusive, after all.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For one thing, rising sea levels set the stage for a more damaging storm surge, as Hurricane Sandy broke records with a 13.2-foot (4 meters) storm surge in New York City's Battery Park, said Pennsylvania State University climatologist Michael Mann.

"At least 1 foot of those 13.2 feet was arguably due to sea-level rise," he said. That's because sea levels are 1 foot (30 centimeters) higher than they were a century ago, he continued.

And if you stop being accurate for fear of upsetting deniers, you've failed at science for a particularly poor reason. 

The thing about deniers is nothing real scientists do will have any effect on their beliefs. That's why they're called deniers. They've concocted this whole conspiracy theory about how scientists are all evil marxists out to destroy the economy, and anything scientists do is evidence of that sinister plot.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, there was a study at somepoint that looked at the full record and found just as many downward as upward adjustments, debunking that particular denier talking point. I can't find it now, but here's the next best thing, a researcher who looked into the adjustments (with some Koch funding) and found them to be legit. Even more, without the adjustments, the record would show even MORE warming than with the corrections! http://www.carbonbrief.org/blog/2015/04/prof-richard-muller-not-adjusting-global-temperature-records-would-be-poor-science/

	<TEXT> I'm confused as to why you think comments determine activity for subs beyond /r/askreddit and other specifically-discussion-based subs. 

9/10 of all posts get zero comments. That was my point when I directed you to /all/new. Most posts die in the new queue, it's a fact of reddit, and part of the upvote-merit system. Judging subs by that is simply ignorant of how reddit works. 

And the nerve you hit is the one concerning false claims with absolutely zero evidence.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Comments are an inherently weak metric for activity, because as this demonstrates, a massive number of comments could be generated by just two users (or one talking to themself) and would give the impression of a large amount of activity when in fact there's not. See /r/counting for a prime example of comments not meaning anything substantial. 

Subreddit growth would probably be the best measurement, since that only includes new, active users (whereas subscribers includes some number of now-inactive subscribers). 

So compare: http://redditmetrics.com/r/climateskeptics

to http://redditmetrics.com/r/climate 

Or don't, and stop with the baseless claim that subreddits you don't like are dead. Just because you don't understand and refuse to acknowledge how reddit works doesn't mean you're right to declare subs dead.
