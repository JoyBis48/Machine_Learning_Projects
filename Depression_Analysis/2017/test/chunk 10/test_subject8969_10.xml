	<TEXT> I just want to be able to laugh, you know? I want to be able to play video games and go outside and have sex and be happy while doing those things. I want to be able to find things enjoyable, and when I dont, I don't get the point of living. I would give anything for the meds and therapy to work and make me better. I would sell everything I have and become a monk if that somehow got rid of my depression. I would do anything </TEXT>
