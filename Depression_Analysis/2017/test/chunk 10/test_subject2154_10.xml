	<TEXT> It does not assume all of his actions are those of a patriarchal racist; it *argues* that his actions are those of a patriarchal racist. That's an important difference, and it's not at all a claim made without evidence. 

It does factor in Atticus's gender and skin color; it certainly doesn't reduce him to it. I think race just might've played an important role in TKAMB, don't you? Doesn't that make it worth talking about?

In what way is this begging the question? It makes a statement and provides a good amount of textual analysis to support that conclusion. That's not begging the question at all.

You're not wrong for reading it that way. I find this reading more compelling. I'd love to discuss it with you and everyone else, but it doesn't seem like you're interested in that conversation. The whole point of posting this is to have that conversation, not to downvote it into oblivion because it proposes a theory we don't like hearing.

In what way is him wanting to keep Scout in permanent childhood baseless? It's certainly not explicitly stated, but it's not at all baseless. And how is that the reviewer being bigoted?

I really don't think you've thought this through as much as you say you have.

	<TEXT> Explain to me how the article is bigoted, not seeing that. It's certainly not on the apotheosis-of-Atticus side of the fence, but that hardly makes it bigoted.

The two books are separate; that's how they've been published. It's not being advertised as a first draft of TKAMB. If anything, it's being advertised as a sequel. Moreover, you can read it as a first draft of TKAMB or as a sequel or as a separate entity without being wrong. Books admit multiple readings.

EDIT: look, I don't agree with everything the article argues, but that doesn't mean it's not worth discussing. It's a really interesting viewpoint at the bare minimum, not without merit. But I'm getting a strong fuck-that-noise vibe from the downvoting, which doesn't seem to be the way to go about dealing with things you disagree with. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> "Like many fly fishermen in western Montana where the summer days are almost Arctic in length, I often do not start fishing until the cool of the evening. Then in the Arctic half-light of the canyon, all existence fades to a being with my soul and memories and the sounds of the Big Blackfoot River and a four-count rhythm and the hope that a fish will rise. Eventually, all things merge into one, and a river runs through it. The river was cut by the worlds great flood and runs over rocks from the basement of time. On some of those rocks are timeless raindrops. Under the rocks are the words, and some of the words are theirs. I am haunted by waters." -A River Runs Through It </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Did you analyze how far the teams that didn't win got in the playoffs vs. how far they were expected to go? Is your sample size big enough to be statistically valid? I find it incredibly hard to believe that getting better pitchers does not make your team better.

Whether or not it's worth it depends entirely on who you acquire, how long they're under contract, how much that contract is worth, and who you give up to get them, among other things. Certainly a debate worth having. But getting better players seems like a pretty black-and-white plus. </TEXT>

All year lineup depth has been killing us, but the bottom half guys (Aybar, Freese, Iannetta, Joyce even) have started to hit like they're capable of, and all the sudden we've taken flight.

	<TEXT> Once again, you're not wrong. And once again, if you think MLB is doing anything that will invalidate billions of dollars in TV contracts, you're also wrong.

It's the right way for them to move going forward. But there is so much money to be made now that they won't do it until they have to, until there is no viable alternative left. Channels and cable companies both view sports as one of the few DVR-proof offerings they have, so they're willing to pay a premium on it, and they'll probably continue to do so for a few years because they have their heads in the sand regarding the shift to Internet content.

You're absolutely correct in identifying the trend. Where I think you're mistaken is in both how long cable companies are going to be willing to throw huge dollar amounts at sports (IMO, a few years left yet), and in how willing MLB is to move on from these contracts while they're still being offered (answer: they won't.)

	<TEXT> Aybar getting a vote! .550 average, 1.495 OPS in the past week. A huge reason our offense has clicked into place all the sudden, Hopefully dropping him back to 5th in the batting order is what he needed. He just seems to feel more comfortable there.

Also, he hit his first-ever homer to CF against the Yankees last week, and it was the winning run. Right after Albert tied the game two pitches before too, back-to-back :)

	<TEXT> as /u/jigokusabre said, baseball is a local product. Teams negotiate their own local TV deals, and in that they are able to sell exclusive regional broadcast rights. This nets them quite a bit of money, as I'm sure you know.

If you were to take away the blackout rules, now those regional broadcast rights aren't exclusive. The value of non-exclusive rights plummets, because there are quite a few people who subscribe to cable/satellite TV packages in large part because they want access to their team's games. Many of those people would become cord-cutters, or at least feel a strong pull to do so, if they could just pay $100 to MLB.tv and get all their team's games. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well assuming the player who has a markedly better career line than Harper but doesn't hit well in the postseason exists (I'm not sure that person does, Harper is a stud), I guarantee the data will show that that player's career line is a better predictive major than his postseason line.

I understand the point you're making, I just don't see anything in the track record that supports it, at least on the level you're claiming. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Honestly, I think that works against your point. Yunel Escobar is 8 for 19 in the postseason in his career. That's a small sample size, but also excellent performance. Why do you not want him up there? He's hit over twice as well as Harper in the postseason by batting average. Is he not clutch until he proves that he isn't? Why? 

Personally I agree. I absolutely want Harper up there, even though his career playoff numbers aren't as good as Yunel's. But you're wrong in saying you can't quantify that info. I absolutely can. By career slash line, Harper is a much, much, much, much better hitter than Escobar. And that's why I want him up instead of him, despite the fact that he has a career postseason batting average of less than half of Escobar's. Because I believe that career slash line is a much better indicator of his ability to perform in that spot. In short, because I don't believe in the predictive ability of the clutch hits that Yunel has gotten. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not saying you can't classify the hits as clutch, I'm saying you can't infer that based on having gotten hits in those situations in the past, you will get them in the future. (Ishikawa I think btw). 

The reason you need sample size on these things is because that's how you determine whether or not such a phenomenon is actually occuring. The smaller the sample size, the less confident you can be that what you are seeing is the result of anything other than random chance. It's like the old flipping a coin thing. If I only flip a coin ten times, there's a very good chance I will end up with a ratio that isn't 5 heads and 5 tails, or even 6:4/4:6. But if I flip a coin 1000 times, there's a very very very small chance that I end up with something that is proportionally far away from a 1:1 ratio between heads and tails. Just because there are relatively few high-leverage/clutch opportunities compared to other types of statistics, does not mean we get to throw out the rules of statistical significance. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Trust me, I've played sports haha. The answer to that is sample size. 5 games is not nearly enough to determine that a dude is clutch. As soon as there's legitimate, statistically valid evidence for clutchness, all aboard! But not til then.

Haha, these are still anecdotal examples. If you look at the data, you won't find evidence for it. Also, Sandoval is playing terrible right now. So is he just only good in clutch situations? Seems like he should step it up every day. And Kershaw doesn't turn into a bum; Kershaw gets left in the game too long because the Dodgers bullpen is so bad. He throws too many pitches, the opposing hitters see his stuff too many times, get settled in, and boom he gets roasted late. 

This stuff slices the other way too. If Harper's so clutch, how come he's a career .200 hitter in the playoffs? Why does he only get on base at a .268 clip in the playoffs? Either he put his clutch socks on to hit those homers and mysteriously forgot to wear them in 2012, or those events aren't explained by his clutch quotient. </TEXT>
