	<TEXT> They must have gay marriage there - because weather is only caused by god and he uses it to punish people for gay sins. Yep, after the scotus decision, and unlike tx/etc, PR amended their laws to reflect the change.

See, all this is so simple when you adopt a conservative view of existence. Allowing gays to serve or marry = droughts, hurricanes, etc. Science is so much easier when you become a super intelligent conservative.

Techs who have worked in the enterprise for years have seen first hand the problems caused by updates (One company I worked for we had to skip an NT update on our core software our reps used wouldn't be able to run on the server).

Give people the option to skip updates - I predict this will lead to headaches, will fail, and as usual microsoft will have to admit they didn't listen to actual users and remove this 'feature'. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Now, think about this:
1. We were told Obama would take all our guns. Not try to, or think about it, but that he could and would. Gun sales soared.

2. The right claimed Obama was banning all wood burning stoves. 

3. The right said Obama was banning chores for kids (I still chuckle over that one).

Go back to 2008/2012 and look at all the fear mongering from the conservatives. It was like code red alert end of America we are all gonna die (probably from ebola or isis flying those libyan jets the right swore they stole and would use to crash into buildings here).

It is all the right ever has. Scare people. Why do you think churches talk about the end of the world and hell? Scare people into obedience. It is how the conservative mind works. It doesn't require intelligence or thinking.

	<TEXT> Naw, trump just knows weak minded people will follow a leader who tells them they are in danger and so is the country and that by voting for him you are saving America, and are therefore a sort of hero.

It's been this way forever. Always some evil force coming to kill us all, elect me and I will save America. It's like the education system. Politicians have said since the 80's it was broken and they would fix if you elect them. 35 years later and they are still saying it is broken and they will fix it.

It's all BS. Tell people there is a problem, tell them you are the solution. War, terror (didn't we just have a few wars over this), immigrants flooding in by the zillions to rape, murder and steal your jobs (that don't exist, remember, because Obama....so not sure where all the  immigrants are working).

People fall for it all the time - while all the real issues that are harming us are internal and swept under the rug. The people in power use fear like religion, to keep the gullible voting for em. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Trump relies on people who don't think but react with emotion. 

He is one of those people who believes that if he just tells you that America is doomed and he can save it that people will vote for him. He knows how to play people.

2 Wars this century and drone strikes across the globe were supposed to make us more safe - now the right wants to go back to war in Iraq and attack Iran. You know, to keep us safe.....

Trump adds in immigration to the mix to add to the fear. More money to spend on borders and troops there, spend more on wars and weapons. All the while people starving and not able to get medical care....well, screw em. Just cause the real things hurting Americans aren't exciting and don't make 'heroes' in epic over powered battles. </TEXT>

Oh yeah, I forgot - Jesus told them "Screw the poor, but if you don't support Israel I will curse you" or something like that. So they help Israel because they believe it is a sin not to, and don't help the poor because they believe it is a sin to do so.

I never will understand those people. </TEXT>

It's so...well, comical :) </TEXT>
