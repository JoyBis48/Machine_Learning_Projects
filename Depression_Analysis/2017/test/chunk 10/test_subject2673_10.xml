	<TEXT> Yes, I do. Whenever I have some I take two 25mg hydroxyzine 10 minutes before I dose. I've found that it increases the nod. Can't say for sure whether it increases thr duration though. Comparatively I think it works better than diphenhydramine (Benadryl) for potentiation. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I use subs on a somewhat frequent basis and recently I had a conversation with someone who's been on them for way longer than me and had experience IVing them. He told me the naloxone is almost completely inactive due to buprenorphine having a much higher binding affinity for the mu opioid receptor, essentially 'outcompeting' the naloxone molecules at the receptor sites. Is there any truth to this?

edit: If this were true it would seem to imply that the naloxone would be inactive regardless of ROA </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thought I could be a chipper and avoid the physical thralls of addiction. I still am, for now. But for me the psychological aspect of addiction has proven to be just as devastating as the physical withdrawals one can go through. I was naive to think that using infrequently would not lead to persistent, daily cravings. Intense cravings that eventually lead to rumination and thinking how good that next high will be. Not sure how long my love affair with opiates will last. Probably the rest of my life. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I understand for the most part we live now in a world where crackheads, drunks and junkies seem to have this kind of hidden feud as to who is the better of the 3...

lol +1 for junkies, spending more time actually being high and less time fiending compared to crackheads is an advantage in my opinion </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Last night I had a dream that I picked up a few hundred bucks worth of 30mg oxys for the amazing price of 20 a piece off this girl I know. I was ecstatic, but as I began to crush up the pills I woke up. Needless to say I was very angry and frustrated.

I find this strange though because I'm a chipper and haven't used in over 50 days, even though I still get cravings every day. I realize mine wasn't particularly interesting, but I thought I'd ask here and see if anyone else had any similar dreams they would want to share. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not as euphoric as Xanax but still good. The only bad thing about them in my opinion is the long half life, so if I take a few too late in the day I'll wake up groggy and still a bit high the next day. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you don't mind me asking, how's your working memory on this combination, and how do you focus at work without nodding really hard? Obviously if you're shooting .15g you must have a massive tolerance to dope but whenever I combine benzos and opiates my working memory and motivation goes to shit. Is your job very mentally demanding? </TEXT>
