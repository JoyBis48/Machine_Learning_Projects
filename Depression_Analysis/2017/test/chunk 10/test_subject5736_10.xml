	<TITLE> [Request] How to be a better reader? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> So I find with most of the books that I read, i read the text but i don;t really retain a lot of the information. This isn't usually too big a problem because most books don;t have too many different plots/characters/etc. However I'm currently reading the Silmarillion, and dear God is there a lot of information. Does anyone have any tricks on how to retain the information that you read better? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm trying to jailbreak my iphone 5s running on 8.4 but the TaiG installer is telling me "Apple driver hasn't been found. Please download and install iTunes". I don't really feel like re-installing itunes and having to go through ratings and playlists again. Does anyone know of a fix for this? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is actually a very good analogy, I think this one would be a bit more controversial because we talk about pizza a lot more than planets (says something about society doesn't it). Change is good but change is hard I guess.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In my mind its simple, it is a dwarf planet, based upon new information that wasn't available when it was first discovered. Things change, we have to adapt. If you still consider Pluto a planet, why? (besides the fact that you like it, or want it to be a planet, that holds no scientific meaning) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When are you no longer a beginner? I've been lifting for a while now, saw good progression at first but it hasn't been as fast recently. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So I'm just starting to follow the beginner PPL Routine (https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/37ylk5/a_linear_progression_based_ppl_program_for/) and it says to add weight linearly 

    2.5kg/5lbs for upper body lifts (bench press, row, overhead press)
    2.5kg/5lbs for squats
    5kg/10lbs for deadlifts

I'm assuming this means add this to only the first lift of the day and with thew accessory lifts increase the weight when i can do the max number of reps per set in the specified range. 5 Pounds per week seems like a lot for bench though, I've only managed to up it by about 10 pounds in the past 2 months (not following this routine albeit). Is that really feasible while eating at a 700ish cal deficit since I'm on a cut?

	<TEXT> I work 9-3 Saturdays and I think I'll bring along a gym bag and if i have energy hit the gym for legs after work. Thanks for all your help, hopefully the next two months can show as much progress as the last two. I think between changing up my routine and adding some HIIT i can really get some good results before i start my first bulk in the October (that's the plan at least). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I really like the look of the beginner PPL (https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/37ylk5/a_linear_progression_based_ppl_program_for/) . I'm wondering if I could do a PPLPP and still see good results? I'm really set on working out on every weekday because it fits really nicely into my schedule and I like my weekends to relax. I have a pretty good base for legs already from running and cross country skiing. </TEXT>
