	<TEXT> I played St. Andrews in west chicago the day before and shot an 88. Shot a 103 on Dubsdread...  but it was also 91 degree with 80% humidity and cart path only.  My drives were all off, and I flubbed 6 pitches or chips into the sand. 

I want to play again in a few months when it's not so hot.  

On a Friday afternoon the pace was great.  4 hour round.  I've heard the weekends drag to 5+, which is unacceptable as far as I care. 

The fairways were great, the rough was really long, and the greens were lightning quick. 

Is it worth it? All things considered, I'd day yes, on occasion.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes, my total was 25 instead of 20.

But I was trying to argue against the guy who's post I was replying too.   

That yes, many blacks do have a poor attitude and appear not to work, and that I have experience that can back that up. 

But then I also said that I blame the "black culture" that has been developed due to oppression and poor education. 

It's your white guilt (I'm assuming) that is making you think I am racist. 

I don't work near poor white trailer parks, but if I did, I'm guessing that the hiring pool would be rather crappy there too.  </TEXT>

And yeah, it's a manual labor job, as it says in the add posting.  And yes, it's the poor attitude that disqualifies anyone from a job.  Much like you seem to have. 

Sorry that I'm not hiring CEO's, owners, or recording artist. I'm just a guy working in a warehouse with 50 other people, trying to keep the product coming in the door, product getting assembled, and then shipped.   It starts at $11, but I have guys making $20.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As someone who has been responsible for interviewing and hiring recommendations, I can attests to this.  Out of 20 people interviewed for a factory job (basic assembly using hand tools, paying $11 to start), 5 will be black, 5 white, 10 latin, 5 other.  9 out of 10 of the blacks don't show up on time or at all, and then are greatly unqualified (mostly poor attitude).  I blame the "black culture" somewhat, but mostly the education system.   We've let down entire generations which is the cause of this "black culture".

From 13 till now, all I think about is seeing women naked and on my penis.  I'm 35 and have some standards now, but as a teen, those standards were A LOT lower. 

That being said, I knew a kid who's mom pimped him out to men, and I've heard of some other fucked up shit, and that's wrong.  

But an older woman that wants to have sex with teenaged boys? Sure,that woman has mental issues, but as a father I wouldn't be upset if my son was WILLINGLY hooking up with some hot older lady.  </TEXT>
