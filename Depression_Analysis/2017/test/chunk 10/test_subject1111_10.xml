	<TEXT> It's well worth reading Chris Evans' various biographies. I've just finished #2, which covers the period where he was married to her.

Honestly, how it comes over is two people that loved each other very much but came to understand that they should no longer be married to each other. They remained close friends and have both since found other partners. Not all divorces end unhappily and not everything is about money. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sure, I'll bite:

* Red Bull - moaning about leaving all year. Can't see them here in  2 years without a major shakeup (e.g. Audi)
* Lotus - financial problems for years now. Clearly in trouble.
* Force India - ditto (but, to be fair, doing quite well this year.)
* Torro Rosso - why would RB keep a B team if they stop racing?
* Sauber - poor results, really poor management and are clearly chasing pennies. Surprised they are still here, TBH.

There, and I've not even started barrel scraping yet... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Good luck! The first year is tough (and for me at least, not that rewarding) but every day now brings a wonderful new experience!

Spent yesterday with child #2 at Beavers camp having a whale of a time and spent today with the whole family visiting at stately home, walking in the parkland and enjoying watching my elder daughter trying to count all of the books in the library in her head (she did pretty well too :) )

Life is full of cool stuff and I enjoy every minute sharing them with my kids. I'm sure you will too :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'd be interested to know how enforceable they are, actually. After all, if your contract says "You are not allowed to make sandwiches for a competitor for 2 years" but the only thing you know how to do is make sandwiches, then the contract is effectively denying you your livelihood. In the US, the contract would probably win, but in the UK, it would not.

I guess it would be argued that all three of them (but especially Clarkson) /have/ done non-automotive related shows before and they could make a living doing something else for a couple of years, but I'd very much doubt it. On the other hand, if it meant Clarkson was forced to spend two years making more war documentaries, then I'm all for it :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I for one welcome what's happening!

We've gone from one Top Gear which, let's be honest, was getting a little stale and could have done with a bit of a kick (even the presenters admitted that they had "done" everything now) to two Top Gears both of which will get a really good opportunity to do new things with a blank sheet of paper.

Sounds pretty good, if you ask me :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> UK person here, finding it hard to get my head around the processes here.

In the UK when you fire someone, it's both serious and requires due process. It certainly can't be done overnight (at least, not for someone who has worked there for a decent length of time). If you did kick someone out of the door without due process, you'd better know where your lawyer lives...

You can also lay staff off for other reasons, most typically due to downsizing. This again requires due process and can't happen overnight for normally employed people. In general, the larger the organisation and the more people they intend to lay off, the longer and more complicated the process is.

An employee "let go" as part of downsizing would never refer to themselves as "fired" which would be reserve for people who had done something bad. They would typically refer to themselves being "made redundant".

No idea how long this has been brewing of course, but I do cringe at the US corporate-centric "hire em, fire em" ethos. Bloody glad I'm on the right side of the pond when it comes to employment law! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No cynical or funny comments from me. That video was, quite simply, the most uplifting thing I've watched for a long, long time. The smile on his face was so utterly genuine that you can't help grinning while watching it

Interesting to watch the "making of" companion video. That first push off the top really was their first go and they weren't at all sure how it would go. Check their expressions and their absolute joy when they realised that it would actually bloody work.

Exceptional and inspiring. Awesome! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I like Cars, personally and my kids /love/ Cars. In fact, if pushed, they'd probably rate it their favourite Pixar film. I've never understood why people (read:adults) look down on it so much. It's a clever concept, well executed with a good storyline. Which of us doesn't enjoy (at least in secret!) watching McQueen come to the realisation that Old Doc is actually the famous Hudson Hornet!?

That said, many animation studios would love to make a feature that is nearly as good as Pixar's worst. That's a track record they can be proud of!

Did Pixar make Planes? Now /that/ was bloody terrible :-/ </TEXT>
