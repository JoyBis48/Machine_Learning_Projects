It's just that though, I'm lazy, or selfish, or something but I just can't help people, but feel like shit that I can't. I've pretty much determined the best way to help people is to not exist at all in my case. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I awoke with a jerk.

Today was the day, the day I would finally get to ask Lord Willakers my question. He was returning today after going to H'cet to assess the damage the elves had inflicted.

Long ago, Lord Willakers ruled over an area within a land called Dong Dank; a place filled with dwarves that acted like all sorts of races, but the pure would reside in the Dwarven District, which he ruled. However, ages ago this place fell into disarray, with warring factions and accidental destruction plaguing the land, Willakers set out for a new homeland for his dwarves.

In his travels, he came upon what we now call a shrine. Hidden deep within the Chocolate Mountains, it had a sort of allure to it, a glow and a power that made him feel stronger and more agile. Finding no adverse effects, he would return to Dong Dank and would make an announcement: all the dwarves that wanted to live in general peace, come with him.

Most of Dwarven District did, with a few from the other districts coming as well. They would build a stone keep in those mountains, centered around the shrine they now praised. This is where I am now; Mount Willakers.

I sprung from my spot on the floor to my feet and put on my boots. We don't have much for commodities here but I was able to fasten myself a pair after collecting bits of leather for weeks. I headed outside the great entrance and looked out into the field. Around the entrance we had a wall, and past that, a camp filled with makeshift tents and campfires. You would think we hadn't been here long, but in fact, we've been here ages.

My great-great-great-etc. grandfather came here from the Dwarven District, and I was raised here in Mount Willakers. Our infatuation with the shrines seemed to halt all other progression of our construction, and so we've lived in a camp of tents for centuries. Being one of the original dwarven families however, I was able to sleep inside, which was a treat, as the weather we've been having recently was rather dreary.

Out into the distance I saw the source of our blight in recent times, as storm so black we thought it may have been bugs instead of clouds. It had been swirling for weeks and stayed just to the edge of the field, by the hills at the front. I walked over and found myself a chair, it wouldn't be long before Willakers arrived.

Slowly a crowd would build by the outskirts of the field, awaiting his arrival. Many dwarves adored the Old Man, and while I could say I did, at the same time I was not infatuated with him. He was a dwarf, same as us all, more powerful yes, but just dwarf all the same. After a few hours, I finally spotted him, coming over the hills with his companions; Nisovin, another Lord of Dong Dank, but also the last known Gnome of his time, and Roamin, a rank 11 paladin that was a descendant of the Lord of Brickton.

A path formed between the dwarves for them. Fearing the Old Man's death stare, they knew they had to step out of the way, or be made to. I stayed where I was, I was in no rush, as Willakers would of course remember that it was my turn for a question, an inquiry, and that I would not have to bother him with such petty reminders.

But he didn't, he walked by with his group of gawkers and proceeded to the entrance.

"Well, maybe he did just forget, he is rather busy." I muttered to myself, grudgingly. 

I walked up behind him as he observed the group of dwarves around him, and tapped him on the shoulder.

"YOUNG DWARF, YOU DARE TOUCH ME." He bellowed, with genuine anger in his voice.

"Well, Mr. Willakers, it's just..." I said, trailing off.

"JUST WHAT, WHAT COULD BE SO IMPORTANT YOU TOUCH ME?" He yelled, louder this time.

"Well, today is my question day, and you just, wandered by, is all." I said to him, half shaking.

"Oh, I see, I'll be right with you, sit back over there." He pointed at the seat I had been in.

I put my head down and walked back, sat and observed him. He dismissed his two companions and talked to a few dwarves before he walked over to me, and pulled over a chair.

He sat down and produced a flask of juice from his pocket, swigging it and then putting it back.

"H'cet survived, barely. They've begun to rebuild and this time, will better protect their shrine." 

I stayed quiet. It did intrigue me, these other shrines. Long after Mount Willakers was founded, other dwarves would venture out and discover more, and under the Old Man's guide, would build more keeps around them to protect them from any attacking force. H'cet was one of these, a smaller one, but extremely fortified as it sat right at the edge of Elf land.

"Well, I suppose I should get going quickly, so, what is your question?" He asked, before preparing to stand up.

"Yes sir, of course, well I wanted to know if...." 

BOOM. A lightning strike from the storm beyond, but not just a normal weather occurrence, this was blinding, even for the Old Man. After my eyes readjusted, I gazed out and saw a new anomaly in the sky. 

A dark cloud? No, it looked, like a ship. 

"Dear God, I knew this day would come." Willakers said under his breath.

"We have until nightfall. GET THE WEAPONS READY, FORGE ARMOR, BUILD A WALL, WE NEED THIS PLACE READY FOR WAR, NOW." He screamed out, so that all dwarves could hear.

I was dumbfounded, I had never seen such a structure before and nor had many of the other dwarves, but I did as the Old Man said. I found myself a juice, a runeblade, and a shortbow, and got to work. I was given armor and fletched arrows until nightfall.

We all stood at the edge of the massive forward wall we erected, stretching halfway across the field.

Beside me, another dwarf would remark "I feel kinda sick.", with a few others around making moans and one falling over.

All of a sudden, my comrade fell flat, and then, within seconds, would spring back up, with his flesh falling from his face and armor shedding off, he began to run at me, maw wide open.

Practicing long ago with a sword and bow, I knew the basics of their function but not much else. I swung wildly at him, successfully pushing him back so he could not bite me, and instead ran after another dwarf. After some time, these "zombie" dwarves would drop dead, and dissolve into the ground.

But this wasn't the worst, floods of monsters, ranging from zombies to wolverines were springing from the ship and decending upon the land. We would do our best to defend against them, shooting and swinging at whatever wasn't dwarf. Many of our men began to realize that our blades and shovels had magical properties, that they could roll and "proc" monsters in quick succession after killing one. Using this to our advantage, we would push back the monsters many times to their ship, but when night fell, they pushed back. Hard.

We would be driven back to the inner wall, then the inside entrance, and eventually we found ourselves in the halls, tandem sword fighting and proccing anything that moved. We could hold, but not forever, and eventually we were pushed into the shrine room itself.

The shrine's light, while empowering us, was beginning to dim, as more and more monsters piled in, until finally, it gave way, and after a thunderous BOOM. I found myself without weapons or armor, and suffered a quick death.

Or did I?

I then woke up, found myself on the floor of Mount Willakers once more, with Willakers shouting at the men to armor up and build a wall to defend against the zombie hordes.

"Oh no, not again." I said, with a sigh.

It's endless. </TEXT>

A "silver" sword that does 15 attack damage and blinds mobs, making them slowed. The glint of the blade is was blinds them, its very bright. This sword is weilded by the Deathseeker, a dwarf with immense power, as he is the only one that can use it.

**Weapon:** Brenna

Its mine. A bow that has such a graceful "twang" when she fires, she pierces the hearts of mobs with double damage, and a spurt of fire erupts around the mob for a second. </TEXT>
