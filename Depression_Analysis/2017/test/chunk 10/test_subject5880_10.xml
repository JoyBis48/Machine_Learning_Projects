	<TEXT> Vape Dojo, eh? Nice to see you still around here. 

I have a question for you. Last night I found myself having a full body craving for Zen Juice - the first Eliquid I've ever had. 

The question is, do I buy all the Zen juice you've ever created, or no? 

Edit: I just bought a lot of Zen Juice anyway. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In my eyes, it's still a really, really great device. While I've stopped recommending it to others as I don't feel comfortable giving them something they'd have to fix, I'm confident in my ability to do so. I don't regret the purchase at all and I don't want to return it. I really enjoy this device. 

However if I had to do it over, I'd plug up the screw on the top of the device closest to the firing button, and I'd insulate the space between the sliding plastic window and the black iStick enclosure - either saran wrapping it to keep liquid out or something else creative.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A user on here seems to think it's about a T6 if that helps.

However, I had your same exact problem. If you need a vape right away and don't have the Torx, here's a couple of workarounds that got me through. 

This isn't going to sound serious, but in all reality, I banged it onto my leather steering wheel a few times right below the button to try to force the button mechanism out. Worked fantastically. 

Another thing that worked was unscrewing the atomizer, screwing another one one, and screwing back in the old one. 

However when you get the Torx drivers, check out this fix I posted today.

The only time I wouldn't present a chemical to a vape is if I believed it were to have the chance of heating up and me inhaling the fumes. However I'm sure that isn't really a hot spot. 

 hell if you really wanted to, you could put some saran wrap under the center sliding plastic window and out over the walls it slides into, and then cut off the excess.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You're not ignorant at all :). However I have seen just a small few people talk about their 30w's autofiring. I've seen way more 50w posts, however. The 50w was also the hottest product on the market at the time, so that could also account for the difference in amount of posts.

I wouldn't stress about it. When the iSticks started autofiring, people really, *really* lost their cool very fast.

When I saw the issue, I just kept doing what I was doing - turn your iStick off when you're not using it. In addition to that, I started sometimes taking off the atomizer if I was going to leave it sit in my hot car during work. That way there is nothing for the iStick to fire.

I had an autofiring iStick, yet I still made use of it for a week, since I really wasn't feeling my mech mod setup. As long as you just unscrew the atomizer as it's autofiring, you're still in control of the device. 

I don't know much about the VT60! What I can recommend doing to learn a bit about it is to punch it into the search engine for /r/electronic_cigarette. Try punching in VT60 autofire, or various other google-fu terms. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Holy shit, dude. I have no clue.

The only thing I could think of is melted glue - as none of that is supposed to bend. The chip is stuck to the batteries and the batteries are stuck flat to the chip. That's some f'd up gore, though, man.

While mine didn't autofire past the 10 second limiter (so far that I've seen), I have seen some that have. Maybe it's possible that this thing fired all night, and the batteries got so hot that it just melted shit up?

If you wanted to check whether or not it was actually the batteries that were an issue, you'd have to peel back or cut through the insulation on both terminals of the battery so that you could put the leads of a multimeter on there. If the battery were to be around 0 volts, that *could* be the reason it won't take a charge, as 18650's won't charge after they stoop down to a certain voltage. However it could also be a faulty chip in that situation. However if the batteries were to be around 3-4v, you know that you've got a chip issue.

I'd ask /r/openpv. I'm not by any sense a master of electronics. I just happened to find a fix for one of the many issues with this device :\. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is a thought provoking idea.

How would you charge it? You couldn't just really wrap the sides, you'd need a full enclosure.

I once saw a tablet on the front page that had a battery vent overnight and the tablet actually burst, showing a full charging bag looking thing. It was pretty interesting. 

I think the issue is that when a battery vents, it lets off so much gas. You'd need that material to have a lot of space to move or it will burst   cause an explosion. I have a charging bag, and it is made to still release gas, but just not flame. </TEXT>

It is mainly due to [this issue I had with them.](http://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/2m5km4/horrible_customer_experience_with_eciggity/)

It is also due to the issues felt by many of those who participated in their Black Friday sale. Many orders were charged upwards of 8 times, totaling over $1000. Here's [one case](http://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/2nowen/eciggity_ruined_my_weekend/), [another](http://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/2o6yo1/eciggity_charges_have_finalized_no_refund/), [another](http://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/2o28ww/anyone_got_any_money_back_from_eciggity_yet/), and [another](http://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/2p4952/continue_to_be_disappointed_with_eciggity/)

It's also because I feel that they participate in vote manipulation on reddit, both on comments made by their official account and on posts relative to their company. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I didn't have the veritas long enough to determine whether or not it was a product I loved - I just know that it never leaked on me and that's my biggest priority.

I've always just brushed off the hardness of building (which is why I own a fogger, the hardest thing in the world to build). However I would like something easier to build, which is why I'm totally into the idea of the Marquis.

However I never had to build my dual coils with only one wire on there! I was able to use two. I can dig up a picture of my build if you're interested.

Edit: I stumbled across my only build image. It's not too helpful anyways, but I still love the color of that 'Nana Cream. http://i.imgur.com/EAEdSlU.jpg </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is super interesting. Thank you for posting this here.

It's very possible that this might not be a forever fix. While jiggling around the button - it does seem to be a piece of shit. However he does attribute humidity to being a possible cause for the button not working - and this should solve the humidity/wetness problem. I still think that the reason the button sticks inside is due to eliquid getting in there.

It was a fix for me, but there is a whole variety of issues some people have with the 50w that this sadly might not fix. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What's up ECR.

I know we had a pretty long period of everyone's homes being destroyed by iStick 50ws. I was confident that my home would remain safe, however my iStick 50w too fell victim to autofiring. 

However I didn't toss her, as I'm poor and cheap - I instead decided to take her apart, have some looks, and see if I could locate a problem. I did this about 2-3 weeks ago, and waited to see if any problem has returned, and I'm happy to say that I have had no further issues at all.

The issues I were having with the iStick 50w came on very suddenly. I was getting high one day, and the dog knocked over my iStick and it leaked liquid all up onto itself, and upon grabbing it a while later, I noticed the firing button would not work. I could adjust the wattage, but I could not fire the device or turn it off.

I later found out that this was because the firing button was stuck on. As I drove into work the next morning, the device actually began to autofire in my hand. I just unscrewed the atomizer, used a buddies vape for the day, and used the device on/off for about a week before deciding to do something about it - as there are no other products on the market that I'm really interested in right now.

So here's a little treat for all of those who didn't throw out their iSticks instantaneously :) - hopefully it'll stop your house from burning down.

Here's a shoutout to /u/ddo405 who tracked me down a few days ago looking to see if my fix was successful. It took me a little bit, as work has been hectic, but I put something together for ya. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm pretty bummed out. I haven't been in a strong relationship for quite a while. I sadly can't even remember when it was, as I got heavy into benzodiazepines toward the last half of our ~14 month relationship, and I really wiped out a lot of my memory for that ~6 month period. I got cheated on, again, by a beautiful woman I was living with. I think its been maybe 2 years since then, but I haven't been able to commit to anyone since.

I'm trying to get back into the game. There was a girl this semester in college I was obsessed with, but it didn't take off. My old friend with benefits who I haven't seen in quite some time said she wanted to get down on Wednesday and I got so fucking excited, and then she called it off. Two nights ago I just got the number of this adorable girl I work with, and we had a date set up for tomorrow, and just now she canceled. 

It's like, I just want a partner to be by my side. I've been diagnosed major depressive with a side of a severe anxiety disorder. In the end of 2013 I went through the hospital system, and early 2014 I did months of therapy, but since the end of 2014/beginning of 2015 I've been really trying to climb above it and feel normal, and mostly succeeding at doing so. I've been working out, getting out, doing fun things, but in these last months its like nobody around me is down for the count. I really struggle to find people to do things with anymore. Although I was there to support all of them at their lowest, none of them turn around to just spend some time - so I'm stuck at home with my depression, getting high and/or drinking, when I'm not bold enough to go out and try to have fun solo.

When I was in that committed relationship, with that partner, we'd do everything together - spend every moment with each other, and never tire of each other. I'd have someone to talk to on long hikes, someone to go cruise beautiful roads and hang around lakes with to just watch the damn sunset and feel alive - but lately I feel that I've got none of that. I get my hopes up so much when I get the slightest indication that things are really starting to look up - that someone is taking an interest in me and I might get a new friend or special someone, but I feel like I keep getting let down again and again. I don't know what it is, but it's got me sad. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I had a similar thing happen to me this semester at college. There was a girl that I was super obsessed with. I tried to move my way closer to her slowly, and I think we decently hit it off, however the opportunity to get her number never really presented itself. I gave up on it, thought about it and she didn't seem right for me anyways. Luckily I've just met a girl through work , and have already started texting her back and forth :). 

In my freshman year of high school, I dated my best friends sister. While me and that friend are still great friends, I can not recommend the dating of the sister.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Congratulations on becoming one step closer to healing. Learning more about yourself is always a great step to make.

The hospital can be a frightening environment, but it is also where I learned some of the most important things I'll ever learn in my lifetime. Don't expect yourself to be fixed as soon as you leave the hospital, but do realize that you will have the tools to much better deal with the problems you encounter in life - and that really makes all the difference. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It changes all the time! I'm into anything but country, but I have to admit that I dabble the most in electronic music. Dubstep is really my best friend (excision shambhala mixes) when I'm having a really controlled energetic mind late night high. Right now I'm spacing out to the metahuman album by eprom. 

Aside from tame impala, other great vibe artists have to be Rebelution for sure, pink floyd is always a given, and I've recently dropped back into Smash mouth ( sugar ray  everclear) as well -  more specifically their astro lounge album I had as a kid. 

Aside from that,  regular everyday music would range from Cake's Satan Is My Motor album, psychostick, tech n9ne,mac Lethal, Eminems old stuff, big chocolate (trap-ish music), Green day, and blink 182,   </TEXT>
