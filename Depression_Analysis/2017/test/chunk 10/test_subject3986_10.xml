	<TEXT> I guess just living in a small town with nothing to do makes everything worse. I don't have many friends, and when I actually need them as a support system they're all out of town :(

I hate waking up and having the same monotonous routine of laying in bed and moping in my room, but I dread interaction and having to get up.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> How to find joy in my bleak and mundane life? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Before I can remember, I've never really felt true joy. Depression runs in my family, and it was no suprise to my mom when I was diagnosed with it last year. Since then, I met my (now ex) boyfriend and for once I was extremely happy because he was patient and kind, but under certain circumstances he broke up with me. Since that day, I have reverted into my old lifestyle of laying in bed for days on end only getting up to use the bathroom. I don't find joy in my old hobbies, and I just spend my days sleeping, crying, or staring into space. 

I have realized that this behavior needs to stop, I'm going to college in September and I need to learn to cope, but it's so hard when nothing except him make me happy.

How do I make the best out of my bleak life? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Today in the mail, I got a letter from the IRS stating that my request for my 2013 tax refund has been accepted and they are mailing me my check. The problem is, I already deposited my 2013 check and have proof with my bank statement. I had a job at an icecream store and quit last year, and since then I havent been working (I am now 18). 

I tried calling the phone number but it was only an IRS automated number. Does this mean identity fraud? If so, what are my next options?

	<TEXT> I dont know much about the jacket, but I have been making props and masks for a while. If you choose to modify the mask, BUY PRIMER! specifically for plastic (I would assume the mask would be plastic) and it comes in a spray paint can. Acrylic paint would work the best because its bright, but the downside is that it chips if you dont seal it. 

Now if you want to make a mask, the quickest way would be to use worbla and shape your own mask. I would recommend using a foam head that they use for wigs as a form. Worbla can be expensive, and a little tricky to work with, but it looks very professional as a final product.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This by far is the best advice. Dont be afraid to give her space and let her cool down as well. The most important thing is to also be understanding, compassionate, and patient. There is not one true way to reach out to her and "cure" her anxiety, but as someone with GAD, the closest thing there is to a remedy is support.

	<TEXT> I posted this answer in another Ask Reddit thread, so here it is:

I'm 5 years older than my younger sister, and when she was born I could never really grasp the concept that she had severe mental retardation. My parents always said she was "special", but I was too young to understand. I grew up loving and caring for her and I doted on her. She was too mentally retarded to walk or talk, and only communicated by pulling hair. 

Fast forward and at this point I'm now a middle schooler who is ashamed and embarrassed of her own sister. I refuse to let my friends come over and rarely ever talk about my sister even though she was the light of my life, I cared more about fitting in. I constantly used the word "retarded" even though it made me uncomfortable knowing thats what people would call my sister. 

One day, the first time I brought a friend to my house to hang out, they saw my sister and called her a "disgusting retarded freak" and she started to cry. I was distraught at seeing her cry and being FULLY AWARE of peoples opinions and what they said about her. I kicked my friend out and hugged my sister for a full hour. 

After that, I realized that my sister isn't something to be ashamed of. She's my best friend, and to this day she will always be the love and light of my life.

	<TEXT> I've got relatives in Boston who frequently send me their winter parkas, snow pants and snow shoes (not that I need them...) so the winter clothes is already taken care of. I was planning on taking public transportation at any school, and would probably just invest in a bike. Not an excuse to go up north, but I atleast have the winter gear covered.

As for fitting in, I guess I am also partially biased but I did one of those programs where you can "spend a night" at a university. I did that for MSU and really enjoyed it. Now my dad lives ~20 minutes from Chapel Hill, and he always like to take me there to hang out and explore, so I dont get much interaction PERSONALLY, but my close friends who attend CH all agree that they feel sort of "lost" at times because they can't quite find their niche.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  does your dad expect you to live with him if you attend UNC?

See thats another issue. This will turn into a war between my parents. They both live equidistance from Chapel Hill and will do whatever it takes to get me to live with them, and they WILL NOT allow me to live on camps. I really want the whole "college experience"  and don't want to have to live in the middle of feuding parents  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My boyfriend is still a junior in HS :) The *main* reason I dont want to go to CH is that I don't find myself fitting in. Yes, I know I'll find my "niche" but I generally dont like North Carolina at all. I just really want to leave for good, which is probably another reason why my dad is so adamant about picking Chapel Hill. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That makes sense. My dad went out of the country for college (Mexico to Boston) and he HATED that he couldn't come home. But I, on the other hand, feel more comfortable "out of the nest".

I will talk to him and ask him if visitation is what's going to bother him, and see what he says.
