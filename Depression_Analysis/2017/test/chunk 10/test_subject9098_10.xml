	<TEXT> True, but I wonder if he just says that to Marty and it's not actually true.  Otherwise, why would Doc be so confident standing in front of the Delorean while Einstein is being sent ahead 1 minute?  Doc and Marty easily could have been ran over if the experiment with Einstein failed. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So at the beginning of the first movie, Marty shows up at Doc's place and all of the clocks are being shown.  While Marty is talking to Doc on the phone the clocks all ring 8:00 am and Doc says "That means my experiment worked".  Referring to the clocks all being 25 minutes slow.  What experiment is Doc referring to in regards to the clocks?  Did he possibly time travel already himself?  If he already time traveled, then that would make sense that he knows Marty will be at his place at that time.  Otherwise, why would Doc call his own home if there shouldn't be anyone there to answer? </TEXT>

Concession stands and small games to play.  Drivers talking and some autographs.  They didn't have anything extra opened up for the garage area or shop/museum though.  We actually had to park in one of the lots for the track and they bussed people in and out of the place since there wouldn't have been room for parking there. </TEXT>

PS1 was just over 100M compared to N64 with just 33M.  SNES compared to Genesis is a bit closer at 49M to 29M.  But regardless if you look at the percentages of sales, the Wii over PS3 and X360 is considerably smaller than any of the previous 3 generations. </TEXT>

Even if you buy the larger 5 quart container it isn't much savings.  Either way, I'm agreeing with you that it isn't worth doing it yourself for the price it can be done at a store.  Maybe a $5 savings by doing it yourself for most vehicles with standard oil. </TEXT>

In regards to the bounty transformer, he was working in secret with whatever the government agency Kelsey Grammar worked for.  Their job was hunting down any hiding transformers.
