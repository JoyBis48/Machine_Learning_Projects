	<TEXT> Not sure about you guys but I'm getting a bit tired of the avengers fighting a large army I'm hoping infinity war will rectify that with Thanos all I want is the aveners vs Thanos thats it.But with AOU I think I was starting to get a bit superhero fatigue because there were just so many heroes involved. 

I like how Ant-Man went back to basics. It was small up close and personal and it was a solid origin story and it was just overall a more enjoyable film for me. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I watched this a couple of nights ago and I gotta say its now one of my favorite DC animated movies. The plot twist was pretty predictable but that didn't take away from the movie though.Some people say the joker was miscast in this but I actually enjoyed the voice actor they chose same for Batman both were really solid.

Its a great animated feature and you guys should most definitely watch it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I found this gem. 

margot robbie is ugly, a bad actress, a home wrecker in real life, and has no charisma to be harley quinn. So many women that have pulled harley quinn off at comic cons, yet hollywood butchered her in this film... Lets see if she acts like an airhead and says funny shit like the real character does... And will smith (which was/is having an affair with margot robbie in real life, since focus) will always be a comedian and suck at being a serious actor... He doesn't even look like deadshot... I guarantee they will both be each other's love interest (again) in this film, since joker is out of the suicide squad. Deadshot should not be a black man... If they made luke cage into a white man, people would cry racism. Then you have ben affleck as batman as the "good" likely protagonist that could never be as good as micheal keaton... The joker doesn't even appear to be the joker... Lets see how charismatic he will be like ledger or nicholson... Killer croc is too small... This is the worst cast i have ever seen for any comic film... And i really wanted to like this film, but the cast killed it... I'm sick and tire of you assholes responding to me when you know i'm going to delete your comment by deleting this one and pasting it again without you shit talking... Let me express myself and leave me alone!!!

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So D23 is coming up and Disney and Marvel are rumored to show the first trailer for Civil War. This past weekend comic-con happened and lots of leaked trailers have been appearing online. 

WB intially only released the Batman V Superman trailer but tried to keep suicide squad comic-con exlusive for as long as they could but eventually caved in and released it in HD as well. 

I hope Marvel learns from this and realizes that its better to release the trailer officially rather than have people watch it in crappy cam quality since its going to leak anyway especially at d23 where the security isnt as tight as comic-con. 

Studios need to stop with this exclusitivity bullshit. Hopefully Marvel learned from this years comic-con and wont repeat the same mistake as WB.  </TEXT>

If something happened to AMD what would happen to the ps4? who would manufacture the chips? would sony outsource development to someone else?

Getting below 70% doesn't mean its a bad movie by any means there are far worse movies out there and besides chances are it could increase to at least over 70% enough to get it certified fresh. Remember the embargo just got lifted so its to early to call the RT number just yet so chill out and go see the movie, enjoy it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For one the ps4 is pretty slim as it is. What I can see happening instead of a slim model coming out is they keep releasing new hardware revisions sort of like the iphone. We've already seen that with the new CUH-1200 model. With an 18% saving in power consumption, A smaller motherboard and memory modules etc.  Well probably get a "4k" compatible ps4 in the future with a bit more horse power. The only thing I can see going wrong is if they make new games only available only on the newer ps4 models. That would just piss people off.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think your partly right. I think they will assemble to take out a bigger threat Baron Zemo? But it will be the last time we see Stark and Rogers team up until Infinity War. I think when Stark finds out Bucky killed his parents Stark wont be able to forgive Rogers for keeping that from him. They will put a side their differences in Civil War for the greater good but once the dust settles in Civil War stark and rogers will part ways until Thanos arrives.  </TEXT>
