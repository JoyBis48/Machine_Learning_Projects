It's a good show, but you aren't really missing out. It's like, I would recommend it but there's other shows I would tell you to watch first.

	<TEXT> What level are you? If you are below 20, complete the story, do bounties, play some strikes. Just get a feel for the game and how it operates.

Once you get to above 20, now you grind strikes to get vanguard marks and level up your vanguard rank. Once you get to rank two, you probably have a full set of blue gear that makes you a higher level. You can also buy gear from the vanguard person to make your level even higher. 

We can talk again once you get to level 28-ish. If you have any more questions about the game, PM me and I will try my best to answer them. Also, if you have Xbox One, you can shoot me a friend request to play missions, do bounties, or play strikes/PvP. My GT is 'Moreos'  </TEXT>
