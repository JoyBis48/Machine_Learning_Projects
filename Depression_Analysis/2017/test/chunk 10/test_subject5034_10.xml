	<TEXT> It is the Supreme Court's responsibility to protect minority rights from legislation which oppresses said rights. They now set precedent to avoid anymore legislation which would infringe on gay rights. This is exactly where this should have been decided. Just like it was the right place to resolve segregation and the infringement of African American rights. That is the whole purpose of Judicial Review. To prevent oppressive legislation by the majority. Good job SCOTUS! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not saying the Vikings had a solid defense in that game. But an offense without Peterson and with Ponder sucks. It's inefficient (time of possession) and has turnovers. That makes success for the defense incredibly difficult.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sproles is much older and certainly did not look better than Shady last year. That Shefter tweet about McCoy being 2nd in NFL in rushing behind Demarco weeks 5-17 last year proves that. He had a slow start, but is still a dominant back.

With that said, I still think the Eagles are the winners by being able to shed that cap hit and getting a potential stud in Alonso. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Are you implying he shouldn't have been charged with a crime? Pretty sure that selling a fake illegal substance is illegal in every state. And if you are dumb enough to try and sell pop tarts as crack you should go to idiot jail anyway.

Edit: Really can't believe this comment is getting this much hate. The guy broke a law and was arrested. Pretty much all I said.  </TEXT>
