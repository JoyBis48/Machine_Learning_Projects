	<TITLE> Think I had a lucid dream, woke up briefly but went immediately back to sleep/the dream, and dreamed that I was still lucid </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So then I started dreaming that I was lucid dreaming because I was before I "woke" up even though since I woke up it broke it and I'm not actually lucid but just dreamt that I was.

Anyone ever had this happen before? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not really looking on ways to get rid of them because I'm lazy and am satisfied with just blowing/wiping them away at the start of each reading session. 

However, what is with them? They just appear. I read that they are common on old books, so why are they on my copy of The Casual Vacancy, that I bought back in February or some equally dismal month.

They do give me a bit of anxiety though, nothing major, but just the expectation of seeing them as I'm scanning each paragraph. I know they're not harmful to humans but I have a thing with bugs. My main issue is spiders. Just last week I was minding my own and  reading "The Five People You Meet In Heaven" by Mitch Albom in my bed and this spider struts up to me on my pillow, and I recoil. Good book though, sorta depressing but I enjoyed it.

So, yeah. What are your experiences with booklice or other insects? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This guy is awesome,  but I think he went a bit too far with sending unsolicited dick pics.

But the satire and making fun of SJWs had me cracking up;

"Did i trigger you"

"You're an obese tumblrina..." etc, that whole section was great.

and then the ending

"The patriarchy is watching ;)"

You played right into his hands and gave him what he wanted: a beautiful reaction. </TEXT>
