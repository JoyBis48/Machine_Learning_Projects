---  
Miss you terribly already  
Miss the space between your eyelids,  
Where I'd stare through awkward sentences  
And void through awkward silence    

 nbsp;  

Miss your teeth when they chatter,  
When we smoked out in my garden  
When we couldn't sleep for all the heat,  
Soft talk began to harden    
  
 nbsp;  
  
Miss your small hands in the palm of mine,  
The fact they're good at making  
Miss you sitting up incessantly,  
And the fact you're always waking in the night  
And night    
  
 nbsp;  
  
And I,  
I hope for your life  
You forget about mine  
Forget about mine    

 nbsp;  
  
Miss your teeth dug in my shoulder,  
As we rolled in early morning,  
Miss your arm dying beneath me,  
As I lay there, simply yawning    
  
 nbsp;  
  
Please forget me, you were right dear  
I am cold and self-involved  
And though I'll miss you, recent lover  
I am weak and therefore fold    
  
 nbsp;  
  
Get distracted by my music,  
Think of nothing else but art  
I'll write my loneliness in poems,  
If I can just think how to start    
  
 nbsp;  
  
Dot my I's with eyebrow pencils,  
Close my eyelids, hide my eyes,  
I'll be idle in my ideals,  
Think of nothing else but I  
I
And I    
  
 nbsp;  
  
And I  
I hope for your life  
You can forget about mine  
Just forget about mine    
  
 nbsp;  
  
Oh, mine  
Mine   </TEXT>
