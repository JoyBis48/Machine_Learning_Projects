	<TEXT> I love Ty Lawson, but this is no longer his team, and his issues on the court have been eclipsed by horrible distractions off the court.  He has been a good player, a good teammate, and a good Nugget - but he is no longer in the right state of mind to be any of those things.  Our organization should reward his past efforts by providing him will all the help he needs off the court, whether that be substance abuse treatment, A.A., or something similar.  In the interim, suspend him indefinitely.   If Ty wasn't locker room poison last year, he will be now.  If other teams come knocking for him, then we'll listen.  If he never shows the F.O. that he wants to be back on the floor as a Nugget, then we waive him when appropriate.

This team no longer belongs to Ty Lawson, and I don't think he really cares about that, either.  Ill Will can tell just from watching a Summer League game that Mudiay is the new face of this team, and I do not want Lawson sulking around feeling shitty about himself and his lot in life and distracting our new leader with his bullshit lifestyle.  Mudiay's head is on straight and I think he plays the game right (and for all the best reasons), so I don't think Lawson's attitude will rub off on him or anything - but I also don't see what Lawson can contribute in his current state.

tl;dr - Lawson has been a good Nugget; he deserves help with the support of the front office, but not to step back in that locker room until he has sorted his life out.  If he doesn't, cut him.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think more than anything, I worry that BvS will be too focused on establishing a gritty or dark tone to the detriment of everything else.  I think that was one of the issues with Man of Steel.  And, what we saw from Lex Luthor in the trailer bodes well for BvS, because it possibly indicates that the filmmakers are avoiding that same mistake.

	<TEXT> Please relax just a little.

First, you're completely correct - these are both trailers, and I think I do a pretty good job of judging the trailer, not the movie (how could I judge the film - I haven't seen any of it!). I am identifying a potential issue with BvS: DoJ and remarking that SS will likely not face that same issue.  I could be wrong.  Who knows, I am just inferring what I can from the trailer.

Superhero movies don't have to be fun and lighthearted to be great, and I welcome them to explore whatever themes and subjects that the film makers would like.  You mention *V for Vendetta*, which I think was fantastic.  But it wasn't devoid of joy.  *Man of Steel* was.  And if BvS: DoJ follows in its footsteps, it will be weaker for it.

Finally, you can disagree with my opinion all you want - that's fine, and I welcome debate and interesting conversations; it's why I like to talk about movies.  But to charge me of judging these films, when I clearly am judging their trailers, and then throw out a dismissive "This is why I hate critics" is an unfair reading of the situation.

Thanks for the comment, and I hope you will start more arguments with me on other entries on the blog!

	<TEXT> I can definitely come with you on *Death Wish*, as you could almost say that it birthed this specific "pedestrian vigilante"genre.  The classics definitely embrace this, but recently it is much more often that a professional, or at least someone *with skill* goes on the revenge plot.

You even take something like The Brave One with Jodi Foster as an example.  True, she is an everywoman - but she is also pretty good at her revenge plot.  The character in *Blue Ruin* is almost define by his struggles and ineptitude (even though he tries really, really hard).

	<TEXT> I really liked this movie, and posted a review on my blog [Plot and Theme] (https://plotandtheme.wordpress.com/2015/06/16/blue-ruin-is-a-brilliant-grounded-deconstruction-of-the-standard-revenge-thriller/).  The opening paragraph is reproduced here to give you a basic idea:

The revenge genre has experienced a small renaissance of late with films like Taken and John Wick portraying purposeful and expert killers running roughshod through those who have wronged them in some way. The audience is generally encouraged to recognize the protagonists ability, and celebrate his or her violence. The low-budget film Blue Ruin, from director Jeremy Saulnier, turns this dynamic on its head by providing us with an everyman thrust into a revenge situation. The resulting story arc follows familiar beats, but the unique perspective infuses this stark film with a beauty and realism that is rarely approached in this exploitative genre. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> YouTube has the retrospectives on our two cup seasons.  I think they are called "Landslide" and "Mission Accomplished".  This will teach you our general history and also showcase our greatest moments.  You will be familiar with the greatest moment in Avalanche history, as it included a famous Bruin at the center of it.

There's also great highlight reels of our current boys like MacKinnon, Duchene, and Landeskog.  

Finally, it is important to learn about Todd Bertuzzi and Matt Cooke, and also just Google "Avalanche Red Wings Rivalry".  These things are all in the past, but they are still formative.

Other than that, just familiarize yourself with our current roster, and pay attention when the season revs up. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You can argue simply from consensus:  T3 hovers around 70% on RottenTomato and TS is at about 33%.  Obviously, RT is not the be-all, end-all for the quality of a film, and you're free to appreciate TS over T3, but as an aggregator of critical praise it gives you a reasonable ballpark at the very least.

And that ballpark says that for every 1 person that liked TS, 2 didn't, whereas it is the exact opposite for T3.  That is surprising to me, as I would have placed T3 somewhere in the low 50s.

Also of note, and of relevance to OP:  TG is currently struggling in the high 20's at RT, so you can certainly argue that it is the worst received of the franchise at the moment. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> He isn't *entirely* contrarian, though.  He agrees with the tomatometer 75% of the time.  He reviews so many films, though, that you can easily point to times where he has disagreed massively.

I don't know if he purposefully wanted to pan Inside Out because everyone else loved it, but he did end up on a C+ for his grade (which, in my book, is above 75%, so rottentomatoes should consider it a positive review).  I consider the film a masterpiece (i've posted my own review recently in /r/movies), and I think he missed the forest for the trees in his evaluation, but that's his loss. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In the following blog post I review and discuss Steve McQueen's first feature [*Hunger*] (https://plotandtheme.wordpress.com/2015/05/27/mcqueen-dissapears-fassbender-in-hunger/).  But, I would love to discuss specific aspects of the film that are not appropriate for a straight-up review, as well.

First, I was absolutely amazed by McQueen's ability to introduce us to this world with very little dialogue.  The brutality is foreshadowed when we see the first prison guard rinsing his scabbed-over knuckles in the sink, and the dreadful tone is established simply by having him inspect his car for bombs as his wife looks on, worried.  This type of world-building continues in the prison, and is simply masterful.  I had known little about these events before watching the film, but it did most of the work for me!

Second, I'd love to talk about the strangeness of the point of view of the film.  Do you think that his film actively takes the side of the Provisional IRA in a political sense - or is it merely revealing the horrors perpetrated by a government over-wrought with power?  I get the feeling that the theme of the film focuses less on political matters per se (so, it isn't about a unified Ireland, or even religious freedom or anything) and more focused on integrity and the treatment of ideological adversaries during war times.  There's also clear themes of propaganda, white-washing, and political statements.  

Finally, I can't get over the climax of the film, which in my opinion begins with Bobby Sands and his priest friend talking, continues for a 17-minute long shot with no cuts or camera movement, and concludes when we get a single cut to Sands getting a new cigarette as he prepares for another 5+ minute long soliloquy detailing his justification for the hunger strike.  I name this the climax of the film because, from this point, all of the drama is merely resolution of the thematic elements introduced here. Haunting and beautiful. 

If you haven't seen this movie, you should really give it a shot, despite how unflinching and brutal it can be.  I simply can't get over it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have a post on my movie blog, **Plot and Theme** where I discuss this movie at length:  [Spoken Language as a Stylistic Choice in Quentin Tarantinos Inglorious Basterds] (https://plotandtheme.wordpress.com/2015/04/24/spoken-language-as-a-stylistic-choice-in-quentin-tarantinos-inglorious-basterds/).  I look at three great scenes where different spoken languages play pivotal roles in generating tension, humor, and plot development:  the opening farm scene, the diner scene, and the bar scene.

Suffice to say, I really love this film, and it's great that is has been added to Netflix, even if only in a few regions. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Alicia Vikander: Great in Ex Machina and Looking Forward to Upcoming Films </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-05-13 21:20:55 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> After seeing *Ex Machina*, I was incredibly impressed by Alicia Vikander, so I looked more into her career and posted the results at my blog Plot and Theme, [here](https://plotandtheme.wordpress.com/2015/05/12/alicia-vikander-is-exploding-and-thats-a-great-thing/).  In that post, I detail some important roles that Vikander has played in the past, and make the argument that she is soon to become a household name due to her future films.

If you're not aware, Vikander has a large number of high-quality films to be released in the near future, and I was surprised at how many of these films I found very interesting.  She is not only working with some talented directors (Guy Ritchie, Tom Hooper, and Derek Cianfrance, to name a few), but a host of A-list actors as well, including Eddie Redmayne, Michael Fassbender, and Tom Hanks.

So, what you you think?  Did you enjoy Alicia Vikander's performance as Ava, or think that it was nothing special?  What about her future films: are there any that have you particularly interested?  I think *The Danish Girl* could be very good, but it has an Oscar Bait kind of feel to it which has me a little reticent.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> IMDB has six films listed as being released in 2015:  five that I mentioned (not The Circle, which is in pre-production) and *Ex Machina*.  But, movies like *Son of a Gun*, *Seventh Son*, and *Testament of Youth*, which she had roles in are listed under 2014, even though some were released in 2015 in some markets.  So, if you include those three with the six I mentioned, you'd get to nine.  Maybe that's the maths behind that number. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> On the contrary, I think *Ex Machina* makes a profoundly feminist statement.

Ava begins the movie as an object in the eyes of the two men in her life.  As the drama unfolds, she expresses her own individual desires and goals, ultimately shaking off her patriarchal captor and knight in shining armor in favor of her own realized personhood.  I have a post at my blog [here] ( https://plotandtheme.wordpress.com/2015/04/30/ex-machina-portrays-a-unique-exploration-of-feminine-independence/)
where I review the film with this precise question in mind.

	<TITLE> A Discussion of the Six Movies To Star Alicia Vikander in the Next Year </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-05-12 20:41:07 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I was incredibly impressed by the performance that Alicia Vikander gave in Alex Garland's *Ex Machina*, so I wanted to look more into her career for my movie blog, Plot and Theme.  The results can be found [here] (https://plotandtheme.wordpress.com/2015/05/12/alicia-vikander-is-exploding-and-thats-a-great-thing/), but suffice to say that I am very excited about these films.

Up next for Vikander is *The Man from U.N.C.L.E*, an adaptation of a british TV spy show from the 70s. Directed by Guy Ritchie, Alicia co-stars with Henry Cavill (*Man of Steel*) and Armie Hammer (*The Social Network*).  Then the European period piece with Christoph Waltz in *Tulip Fever* as the subject of an artists painting during the Dutch Tulip craze.  Late this year, Vikander is set to star beside Oscar winner Eddie Redmayne in *The Danish Girl*. This film, directed by Tom Hooper (*Les Miserables, The Kings Speech*), tells the true story of Einar Wegener / Lili Elbe, a Danish artist who transitioned from male to female in 1930s Europe. Shell also star with Bradley Cooper and Jamie Dornan in the comedy *Adam Jones*, about a chef who assembles a crew to create the best restaurant ever. Continuing this run, Alicia joins Michael Fassbender and Rachel Weisz in *The Light between Oceans*, a story about an Australian couple who raise a baby rescued from an adrift rowboat (hopefully more cheery than director Derek Clanfrances *Blue Valentine*). Oh, and if that was not enough, it was announced this week that Vikander signed on to star with Tom Hanks in *The Circle*.

It is hard for me to even choose which of these I am most excited for, but it would probably be the recently announced *The Circle* with Tom Hanks.  I have always been a sucker for a good techno-thriller.  Although co-starring with Eddie Redmayne in *The Danish Girl* could be something special as well. What about you - were any of these films on your radar?  If not, are you excited about any of them now? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> A Review of Duck Soup Cinema: "The General" from my movie blog, Plot and Theme </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-05-08 23:24:36 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> For those cinephiles out there unaware of some of the great offerings our little capital city has, I have published a short review of Duck Soup Cinema:  *The General* at my blog Plot and Theme.  You can find the particular post [here] (https://plotandtheme.wordpress.com/2015/05/08/duck-soup-cinema-and-the-general/).  

Duck Soup cinema endeavors to show old silent movies with live musical accompaniment, with original film stock and projection.  The shows often begin with live, vaudevillian-style acts, but I haven't mentioned that in the blog post (it tries to focus on movies and movie news).  It was absolutely one of the most fun experiences I have ever had at the movies, and I am looking forward to future shows, which can be perused at [The Duck Soup Cinema page] (http://www.overturecenter.org/programs/duck-soup-cinema) at the Overture Center website.  And yes, tickets are only $7, which is likely cheaper than most movies you'll see in modern theatres. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Lots of people here are saying "cash", but I think it is clear that you'd prefer something else.  You're asking about a payment methods that is safe, secure, and can't be faked, while at the same time not exposing you or the buyer to holding large sums of cash.

You want bitcoin.

I know, I know - bare with me.  If the buyer wants your car, they can set up an account at a place like circle.com or coinbase, or a number of others.  They will be able to buy bitcoin with their bank account, transfer the bitcoin to a wallet (on their phone, for example), and then come to meet you.  They can inspect the car, and if you agree to the sell, he will transfer the bitcoin to your wallet (again, on your phone, or computer, or whatever; I recommend the Mycelium Wallet).  The transaction will show up almost instantly, and you'll be able to see the bitcoin leaving his address and going to yours, but there won't be any confirmations.  Wait for six confirmations (about an hour) and you can be almost certain that the money will not be double-spent, and it is yours.  Then, sign over the title to the buyer, and you are done.  If someone were to try to take your phone (to get at the bitcoin), simple passwords and 2FA will keep them from spending it until you recover your wallet.  You can keep your new bitcoin or deposit it into an exchange to turn it back into your local currency, whichever you prefer.

The biggest difficulty would be getting your buyer to buy all that bitcoin.  But, if you're willing to learn how to use it, it will most certainly be the most secure and safe way to transact.  Best of all - you can do it at any hour of the day (no need for an open bank!) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It is certainly true that Tarantino builds and releases the tension in the opening scene in a variety of ways; I am sure that one could write an entire piece on just that idea and find it very fruitful.  There's the claustrophobia that you mention, the movement of the camera and the closeups on two outstanding actors, but that is only the beginning.  The scene seems to breathe with tension as it alternates between interrogation, comic exaggeration (Landa's pipe), and horror.

I would agree with you that this is Tarantino with his full powers realized.  But where I think this scene truly shines is in teaching the audience everything they need to know to understand how the rest of the movie is going to work.  It shows us how spoken language will be important; how comedy, tension, and gore will interact, and introduces us to the titanic character of Landa, who drives the plot as much as anyone.  It truly is a great opening scene.

	<TITLE> Spoken Language as a Stylistic Choice in Quentin Tarantinos Inglorious Basterds </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-05-04 20:41:27 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> In my newly-launched movie blog, *Plot and Theme* I have recently posted [this essay] (https://plotandtheme.wordpress.com/2015/04/24/spoken-language-as-a-stylistic-choice-in-quentin-tarantinos-inglorious-basterds/) on Quentin Tarantino's *Inglorious Basterds*, wherein I analyze three scenes in which the language(s) spoken by the characters greatly enhances the drama, comedy, and tension in the scene.

I have chosen the three scenes:  the opening scene with Colonel Hans Landa, the diner scene with Shosanna (now named Emmanuelle) and the underground bar scene which kicks of Operation Keno.  In the essay, I discuss the importance of Tarantino's decision to use communication and language as a specific stylistic choice, instead of defaulting to all-English for the sake of the audience.

Most of the readers of my nascent blog are friends who are more interested in my reviews of more recent movies, and so they are not as interested in these more-developed pieces as I imagine a community like /r/TrueFilm would be.  As such, I have provided a link and brief description of the post, as well as its full title in hopes of sparking more discussion on what I consider to be a critical choice which makes *Inglorious Basterds* a seminal movie in Tarantino's filmography - and perhaps his masterpiece.

How do you respond to the manipulation of spoken language in this film?  Can you think of other scenes where this happens in this, or other movies? </TEXT>

If, however, you adjust for inflation, you get [this list] (http://www.boxofficemojo.com/alltime/adjusted.htm).  There's a bunch of reasonable answers there, with *Dr. Zhivago* probably being the highest-grossing film meeting your description. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It is a little rough nailing down exactly what it meant by "critically acclaimed" (not your fault - there's just different metrics from person to person), but you can make a little headway.

If you look at the highest grossing box office returns of all time, there are some standouts.  *Frozen* sits at #5 all-time, and was very well received by the critics, and there are some other very good animated films that have a similar standing (see:  *Toy Story 3* at #14 and *The Lion King* at #21).  The best films in blockbuster trilogies tend to be well-represented, too:  *The Return of the King* is at #9 and won 11 Oscars and both *The Dark Knight* and *The Dark Knight Rises* sit in the top 20.  The best answers that are not animated or comic book / fantasy franchises are things like Inception (#43), *E.T.* (#48), and *Forest Gump* (#76 ).  All of these films made over 2/3 of a billion dollars, but once you go around 500 million you start to see things like *Saving Private Ryan*, *American Sniper*, and a bunch more. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> /u/All_Seven_Samurai is pretty spot-on here:  A Clockwork Orange's reputation makes it seem like it is going to be fantastically uncomfortable to watch, almost as if it is some kind of taboo, but this just isn't the case, for a few reasons.

First, violence in movies (both sexual and physical) has come a long way since 1971.  I don't want to downplay the horrific acts that occur in *A Clockwork Orange*, because they are integral to the story, but suffice to say that you *probably* are building them up in your imagination.

Second, the violence is very stylized and almost comical in some senses (which I think is where /u/All_Seven_Samurai's characterization of it as "tasteful" comes from).  The bottom line is, whenever there is violence on the screen in this movie, you are absolutely certain that it serves some artistic purpose - that it is not violence for its own sake (or for pure shock value).  That, in my mind, lends great credibility to scenes that otherwise might be questionable.

And finally, the violence actually plays an incredibly important role *in the plot of the movie* (in more ways that one, actually).  Hence, you can be rest assured that even if you watch it and feel upset because you don't like the violence - then Kubrick has you right where he wants you, which will likely give the film more punch.

Happy viewing!

PS:  *2001* is life-changing.  Keep it on the DVR; one watch is not even close to enough. And *Barry Lyndon* was the last Kubrick film that I watched, and is quickly climbing the ranks in my estimation. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you watch the scene just before this one, you see Jack walk through the Overlook hotel and look around.  As he walks into the office, it is clear that it is completely contained within the Overlook (so there is no wall of the office that could possibly be in common with the outer wall of the Overlook).  Hence, this window shouldn't exist.

This is just one example of a number of architectural anomalies the Kubrick shows us in the Overlook hotel.  You can find more if you pay close attention to when Danny is biking around and such.

	<TEXT> This is all correct, and I in no way wanted to point to this study as a faithful representation of either Nigerians, black women, or any one single group other than women with HSV-2 who took the questionnaire.  That is clearly, as you have pointed out, absurd on its very face.  But, having their questionnaire plus actual serological data gives the researchers the ability to correlate certain activities of the women in the study with their HSV-2 seropositivity.  Obviously, correlation does not equal causation, but these correlations let the authors state a conclusion like, "The women who participated in sexual activity at a younger age were more likely to be seropositive" or, "The women with more sexual partners were more likely to be seropositive" and so on.  And, as I suggested, it is wrong to immediately assume that these correlations would prove true all over the world (due to myriad factors), but they do provide possible explanations that could be tested with further studies or by data-mining previous ones.

Essentially, this study provides data which can be helpful for informing new studies or directions to look - not because the woman were Nigerian or black or anything like that, but because they correlate HSV-2 seroprevalence to specific behavior. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As with most questions in science, the answer is both:  1.)  Complicated and 2.) Not completely understood, but I can point you to some possible explanations.

Late last year, [Kalu EI et al](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25116666). published a study of Nigerian pregnant women dealing with the sero-prevalence of HSV-2.  Interestingly, they found a prevalence very similar to the study which is linked by OP: 47.3% of pregnant women given the survey and tested had HSV-2.  The possible explanations  that they derived based on their questionnaire were:  "early exposure to sexual intercourse, number of sex partners, involvement in polygamous marriages, involvement of husband in extra-marital affairs and hormonal contraceptive use."  And, while it would be wrong to assume that what is true in Nigeria is 100% applicable to what is true in the USA with regards to this question, I think as long as the science is rigorous, we can learn from it.  Obviously, this study did not attempt to answer the question with regards to race or socio-economic status, but it does give us some directions to look (for example, do black women engage in sexual intercourse at younger ages than other racial groups, on average?  Do they generally have more sex partners?  Etc, etc.)

	<TEXT> I have an eerily similar, equally-crushing story.

Last year for Christmas, my new wife (we got married on the 20th) spent some time with my mom and her parents.  Also in attendance were children and grandchildren from this grandpa's first marriage.  The Christmas dinner included two full Prime Ribs, which were to be prepared in a rotating slow-cooker.  We were very, very pleased.

As you have guessed, my non-biological grandpa and his family were in charge of the Prime Ribs, and they like their meat well-done.  Hence, when it came time to serve the Prime Rib, and I was looking for some correctly cooked slices, there were none to be found.

Now, I am not some kind of unappreciative asshole - you buy the meat then you get to cook it however you want, even if I think it is abominably incorrect.  But, why would you need to do that with a Prime Rib Roast?  The losers can eat the ends and outsides and we professional meat-eaters can have the middle, red, delicious parts.

But nope, solid grey throughout *both* roasts.  Boo. </TEXT>

It is worth pointing out that the defense given by the players was that it has been "six weeks" since the team won a game at home, and that they were disgusted by that fact and using it as a rallying cry. This makes some sense, as the team last won at home on Jan 14th, against the Mavericks. But, the end of the season is six weeks from tomorrow, so it was about six-and-a-half weeks from both events when the chant happened.

And that kind of unfortunate coincidence completely describes exactly how the Nuggets' season is going.

	<TEXT> That would be great, but we're tanking fairly well now as-is.  We'd effectively have both our ping-pongs and theirs for the upcoming lotto (which, atm, would give us almost a 1-in-3 shot at #1 overall, and a top 3 pick about 4/5ths of the time).  That is pretty sweet.

But, I think the dream scenario is to tank all the way to #4 or #5 (#4 requires the Lakers to gain 3.5 games on us; not impossible with 20+ to go), and snatch a top 3 this year.  Then, next year, have the Knicks suck again and grab another top 3 while we compete for a playoff spot.  Two years running with top 3 picks is almost what the Magic did in the early 90's (when they got back-to-back ones in Shaq and Webber), and is definitely the best shot we have at building a strong team (coupling new superstars with the strong role players that we have now, both from foreign finds like Nurkic and Lauvergne and established talent like Lawson and Gallo). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree with you regarding D'antoni/Karl.  While there is likely at least some merit to taking advantage of the altitude with a high-octane offense (D'antoni's signature strength going back to the Nash-led Suns, and a tradition here in Denver going from Karl all the way back to Doug Moe), I think that approach is fundamentally flawed.  And that flaw comes with the way the NBA playoffs are structured.

During the regular season, the Nuggets get teams coming into town on the second night of back-to-backs, or even a 4th game in 5 nights.  Those teams are certainly at a disadvantage.  Even teams coming in on a normal road trip can have an issue, as there is less time to devote to defending this high-speed offense.  But, in the playoffs, that all goes out the window. 

Generally, you get the 2-2-1-1-1 structure (I am aware that the finals are different - but the Nuggets have never gotten that far, so who cares?).  In this structure, there is at least one day between games, and sometimes two or even three!  Hence, you get rested, well-coached teams which have time to prepare for this specific, unique, fast-paced offense.  This traditionally results in the Nuggets losing badly in the playoffs, even when they are favorites.

So, I agree - the Nuggets need to move in a more strategically sound direction.  You can still take advantage of the altitude during the regular season, but do it not by running up and down the court, but through sound ball movement and a punishing defense which forces an offense to work for every shot attempt.  Then, in the event that the team finds its way back to the playoffs, that kind of non-gimicky gameplan can travel well and compete with a well-coached team. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Especially if we only have to ship one of the protected first that we have (I think we have a Cleveland one and a Nicks one left?  Hard to remember where everything came from).

Point is - we may have the bargaining chips to send a 1st for Thibs without impacting the future, and it'd be great to have him, as you said. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, exactly - something where keeping Shaw around was permanent damage to the team (in your example, by making the players feel like management didn't support them - likely leading to players wanting to book it for greener pastures). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am in agreement - Brooks often looks horribly outcoached in playoff series, only to be bailed out by his supremely talented players.  I shudder to think what will happen if he is forced to go from Durant/Westbrook/Ibaka to Gallo/Lawson/Faried (I love 'em, but seriously). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is very interesting.

Now, I know that man people who frequent this sub were tired of Shaw, and wanted him out, so I can understand the elation that I am seeing everywhere, but I'd like to draw attention to how strange this is (in my opinion at least).

It is pretty clear that this team in in tanking mode.  If they end up with more than 25 wins this year, it will be a mistake (fortunately, we are well on track for the #5 slot in the lottery, which gives us a good puncher's chance at top 3 (almost 30%, with 9% chance at #1 overall).  That being said - why not just let Shaw carry out the rest of the year?  What is to be gained from having an interim coach for the last month and a half?  The only conclusion that I can come to is that the front office thinks that the longer Shaw stays around, the more damage he does to the players we have.  They want him out ASAP so that he doesn't frustrate Lawson (for example), or so that he doesn't keep wasting opportunities to get rookies minutes, or so he doesn't poison the culture beyond repair.

Anyway, it just strikes me as a horribly negative view on Shaw as a locker-room presence.  It may be justified, but that doesn't make it any less surprising for me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Also, Bender has an odd obsession with the concept of "irony", there's a great circuitous "Gift of the Magi"-esque plan, and while there are a lot of subtle jokes, there are also many great jokes which basically just involve a character explaining how they feel (which makes me feel angry).
