	<TEXT> For once I would like someone to take care of me, to tuck me in and wake me up with breakfast. 
For once I'd like someone to miss me when I'm not there, and think about me when I'm not around. 
For once I'd like to be spoilt, like I should have been when I was a child, spoiled with cuddles, kisses, cuddly toys, wine and anything else!
For once I'd like to stop pleasing other people and have someone just impress me. Take care of me. Love me. 

I'm fed up of taking care of everyone else and not getting it back. Right now I deserve to be looked after. I hate being depressed.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've been depressed for 8 months (diagnosed) and around 4 years undiagnosed. I'm a female, and I work full time. I Still live at home, and I hate my life. I come home after work just to be a slave to my parents. Doing all the things they should do but don't bother. My parents and siblings constantly berate me and tell me I'm not depressed. They refuse to understand why I may be upset, why I take strong anti depressants. My mum refuses to come to the doctors with me so the doctor can explain it. I break down weekly to my therapist about it. I find it exhausting to continuously come home and be asked to wash up, dry clothes, clean up, vacuum. It's frustrating, and physically tiring. 

Eurgh. Help.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh :( the gym is good! I do that too, therapeutic. 

Numb isn't the nicest feeling, but I'd rather that then be close to psychotic. I don't enjoy being emotionally unstable.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've suffered with depression for a long while, and the worst.thing my SO could ever say is that I'm an attention seeker. He has made the mistake a few times and it breaks my heart as he doesn't realise how it affects me.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've been on anti depressants for 6 months and I've tried so many different ones like sertraline, citrolopram and another th at I can't quite remember. I work best with citolopram. I do find sometimes I feel numb, but it doesn't make you happy. It just balances out your moods! You can still be happy and take them, it really just balances the serotonin in your brain to make it better balanced. Maybe see a therapist or a councillor whilst taking the tablets. There's no harm in trying them, and stopping if you feel wrong. 

Best of luck.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Think positive, and perhaps if you feel yourself getting irritated, take yourself away from the situation and calm down.. take a breather. I get really moody, but people around me know my situation so know I can't really help it. Good luck x </TEXT>
