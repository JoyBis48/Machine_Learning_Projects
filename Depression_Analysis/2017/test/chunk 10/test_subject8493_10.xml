	<TEXT> I second that last comment.  
China can be a great experience with a positive attitude; most of all, the people are very nice - especially in the northeast where you are going. Gruff on the surface but great friends once you get to know them. Take every opportunity to mingle and spend time with people. 
Also, be on guard that employers  will try to use you, so don't be afraid to politely stand firm when you feel it's necessary.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ignore the negative reddishit; if you come with a positive attitude and a true desire to educate as well as learn yourself, you'll do great. Rural China might be tougher than you expect in terms of living conditions. I would start in the city.  </TEXT>
