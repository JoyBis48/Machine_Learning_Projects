	<TEXT> It has been an eternity and i long for the feeling of affection, to care about my meaningless things, be loved or touched by someone but i can't get out. I really start to freak out wondering if i have broken my brain, gone too far. Would my sober life now consist of me being stuck in an asylum. I am now a nutcase and this weird feeling of everything is driving me crazy but there is no escape. I soon come to grips that i am powerless to change these facts, so i might as well make the best of it. Fuck it, this feeling is good and i am good. It is what it is, everything that was and everything that ever will be. I started to feel a nice sense of comfort with this realisation, all my trip buddies are feeling the goodness and are good. I think to myself this is why i like them so much, slowly everything starts to calm down as i begin to pick the pieces up of my sober life. I realise that i am going out later, that it is a saturday; tomorrow will be sunday and so on. time finally exists and I am free to do whatever i want.

I can relate to this so much </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I sometimes get so busy and stressed that I spend even an hour just sitting down and thinking in a circular pointless way trying to remember what should be done as if I am always forgetting something. I feel stuck all the time so I resort to just focusing on one thing for example studying for a statistics exam. Eventually I get into a thought loop where my mind wanders and then I forget about something important and I just feel frustrated. This has been happening for 3 years and I have been failing college as well I don't know if this is related. I feel like I have a disorder or somekind but would like some input.

	<TEXT> Im 120lbs and I heard that low doses of DMT seem to almost always induce a bad experience and that trippers should go for a breakthrough dose such as 30mg-40mg and that it isn't scary once you are in the experience. I am aware that it is one of the most potent substances and my only experience is with acid and shrooms. I want to test the waters since I don't know what my reaction to DMT will be like.

What is your suggested dosage? to those who are experienced with dmt </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  actual antidepressant


These have made me worse. Shrooms is the best anti-depressant in my experience. 


Tripping all the time in an effort to stave off feeling the symptoms of depression would be as counterproductive as any mindless drug habit


It seems to me to be a treatment rather than an addiction since the positive effects lasts for weeks after taking the psilocybin.

It's more of a relief from depression than a numbing escape from it. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> I think nofap and noporn have no effect on me </TITLE>

	<TEXT> I'm not saying it doesnt work for everyone of course everyone is different but after going on 90 day streaks multiple times and experimenting I find that nofap and noporn have no effect on my life whatsoever. 

If anything; it has a negative effect overall in that I am unable to sleep due to high libido as well as being unable to focus on work or college. My usual routine is pmo once or twice a day but I will keep it at once a day and I will try to cut out porn if I can.

Women are still attracted to me whether I have fapped all day or am on a long nofap streak. I perform the same at college as well. I guess this is good bye to nofap but I will return every now and then to check out how people are doing. 

Good bye :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> After a lont time I started to learn a couple of truths about life. Ive been thinking a lot and some important thoughts have been crossing my mind..

Anybody else think that "happiness" is overrated? We have a climate problem + we have overpopulation with 7 billion monkeys on the planet. 80% of these 7 billion live in poverty and misery on less than $10 a day. 20% who live out of poverty are overly consumeristic and unhappy. 

I think old ideas of "happiness" dont apply. I think a revolution is going to come soon in the form of either war or natural disaster and it will be about survival more than the petty "american dream".

I think studying 5 years of your life for a degree and then throwing your resume into a pool of other resumes only to find out that either the job sucks or that you can't find a job because of unemployment is a path that too many people are taking.

The last topic I would like to discuss is love. You may find that special someone and spend the best years of your life with them and you will be happy or you may find that your partner is only there to take advantage of you and ruin your life in terms of divorce and child support.


I dont know why I am rambling. I could be completely wrong. But I just wanted to discuss these topics. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [Question] Toxic Black smoke </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-05-01 10:34:14 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I vaporised some weed in a lightbulb (I had cleaned the inside so there is no toxic coatings etc). I kept on heating it up with a candle just to make sure that all the thc will get out even though it already looked used up.
Some black smoke started coming out with a really bad smell and as I inhaled I felt sick and dizzy and even now (1 week later) I feel like an idiot as if this caused me some brain damage. I feel sick like I could pass out at any moment and I have been like this for 1 week now. That black smoke looked really toxic as if I was breathing in a car exhaust pipe.
Is all damage caused by smoke healed and reversed over time?
I feel like I was heating up and smoking ash and burned sugars :/.
All of this just to make sure that I dont waste thc :( </TEXT>
