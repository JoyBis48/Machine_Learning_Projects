It's beyond ridiculous. I'm all for the rights for Israelis, Jews, or however people prefer to classify themselves to exist and thrive in safe harmony, but what you don't get to do is be persecuting discrimatory hyperbolic hypocrites and think that's ok, because it really isn't. On a separate note, much of this 'military foreign aid'is used to buy American materiel, so it's not so much giving taxpayer dollars to the Israelis as feeding it back to the domestic military-industrial complex. Then these relationships include political contributions, political approval for military spending, lobbying to support bureaucracies, and oversight of the industry. And that's why they'll probably get their $4.5 billion.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> [Dragon's Egg](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Dragon's_Egg) by Robert L. Forward. Absolutely magnificent. I'd link to the wiki, but it gives away the whole plotline. But here's some reviews.

"Knockout ... One of a handful of books that stretch the mind." ~ Arthur C. Clarke

"A tour-de-force meticulous creation of an unbelievably alien race ..." ~ Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine

"This is one for the real science-fiction fan."  ~ Frank Herbert, author of Dune

"DRAGON'S EGG is superb. I couldn't have written it; it required too much real physics." ~ Larry Niven

"Never in the history of science fiction, I think, have so many of the
most exciting contemporary scientific concepts played a role in a book." ~ Frank D. Drake, Director, National Astronomy and Ionosphere Center

"Exemplary hard SF . . . There is no more dazzling practitioner of the form." ~ Locus

"Forward has impeccable scientific credentials, and ... big, original,
speculative ideas." ~ The Washington Post

"Forward's plot, both simple and grand, is the whole history of an alien civilization and the effect contact with us has on it. Those who crave real science along with their fiction will be mightily pleased with this mind-expanding and engrossing example of SF in its purest form." ~ Publishers Weekly

"Dazzling, beautifully worked-out scientific extrapolations
... An adventure that's sure to please fans of 'hard' SF." ~ Kirkus Reviews </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The best way to get rid of a leech is to just leave it until it is full. After 10 minutes it will be full, stopped the blood flow, and will leave the body. While it is untrue that ripping off a leech will result in part of it being left behind, the leech uses an anticoagulant to prevent the blood from clotting, so removing the leech will result in the wound not healing quickly and a loss of even more blood. The leech will seal off the wound when finished drinking about a teaspoonful. Burning the leech will make it vomit which may result in other blood it has collected going into your body.  </TEXT>

If I were to answer though:

* Many rumors, none substantiated.

* Vic was well loved by redditors. Also, [see this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/3c5jec/mod_post_the_timer/).

* See previous.

* It's poorly handled, sure, not sure there is a great way to approach it that would make things better.

* No, of course not. They don't have the staff to replace the volunteers. I hadn't heard that one before, but this one is certainly false. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As a current mod of /r/technology, I feel I should update our current circumstance. We had a few moderators who had added terms to Automoderator such that posts containing these [terms would be automatically blocked](https://pay.reddit.com/r/undelete/comments/22yewf/i_have_identified_a_list_of_keywords_that_are/). This was obviously scandalous. Those moderators were removed, and a raft of changes drafted to ensure it would not be repeated. Along with open recruiting of a new mod team based on skills and merit, new rules for the sub were proposed, voted upon and adopted by the community. The CSS for Automoderator is available for anyone to check [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/wiki/config/automoderator). Mods can be messaged via the /r/technology sidebar, and yes we do read and respond to them all. Whether we're default or not doesn't particularly faze us, we have a huge community who I'd argue now feel they have greater ownership of it. We only have 27 moderators for 5.146 million subscribers, we rely on them to help us keep it as we would like the technology subreddit to be. Anyway,  we may never outlive how those who came before screwed up, but we're doing ok doing what we do. Hope that helps.. </TEXT>
