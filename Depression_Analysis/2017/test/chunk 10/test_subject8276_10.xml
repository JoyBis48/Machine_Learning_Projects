	<TEXT> So I live with my family my mom, dad, brother, and my sister is visiting from college. Also my cousin is visiting for the summer too. Anyways I go to work usually and I mostly just do that and come home, I also go to the movies a lot like twice a week. My mom and sister though have been sneaking out and going to the cinema by themselves I think they tell my dad sometimes but noone else. Like just today they were gone for like 7 hours and didnt tell anyone, It just annoys me when they do that mainly cuz I always go by myself and so I love when someone else is with me plus I like going as a family. But whenever they do that it just peeves me off like "oh I dont need to tell you, its just us girls". The weird thing is too my mom rarely used to go to the movies shes only started going when my sister is here, it just pisses me off, next time they leave the house I am gonna go with them!!!!  </TEXT>
