	<TEXT> This summer I was given a summer reading list for my 9th grade Honors English class.I looked through the list and picked out Uncle Toms cabin.I've started reading it but haven't been able to get into the book.I don't know if its just what happens with most books where the begining starts out slow or is it just the time of when I am reading it and the reason why I am reading it ? Has anyone else experienced this ?
Thanks </TEXT>
