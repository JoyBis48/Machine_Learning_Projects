*"Ganot's Physics," 1886, and "Aspects of the Earth," 1889, both of which have wonderful illustrations. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Her comment about Ambrose beating his whores, when explaining her motivation for helping Kvothe steal back Denna's ring.  It was obviously based on personal experience.  That, and other subtle clues that she very frequently entertained males guests of, shall we say, brief acquaintance.

She also offers to sleep with Kvothe in exchange for getting into the archive, like it was a usual business tactic of hers.

EDIT: And there seems to be a bit of downvote brigading going on, for no reason.  Anyone else notice this? </TEXT>

Not particularly.  Even when Israel faced an existential threat in '67 and '73, they didn't use nukes.  They didn't use them against Iraq in the '80s.  Why expect a nation like Iran to behave any less rationally?  They don't have any use for nuclear weapons beyond pure deterrence, same as Israel, India, and Pakistan. </TEXT>

So weird that 2000 years of history is dismissed

Yes, it is weird that you're ignoring almost 2000 years of the Palestine region having a very small, non-sovereign Jewish population, while being heavily inhabited by Arabs, some of whom still live there and would like to keep the land they're currently living on. </TEXT>

Yeah, because that makes sense, when talking about gun laws.  Hey, let's talk about other, non-related stuff!

because the point of gun laws is to reduce the overall homicide rate, not just a particular type of homicide.

That's the opposite of reality.  That's like saying seat-belt laws are intended to reduce the overall mortality rate, rather than the car-crash fatality rate.  Because that's pretty fucking stupid. </TEXT>
