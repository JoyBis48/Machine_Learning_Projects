	<TEXT>  144 deaths, 1,391 injuries and 8,061 device malfunctions were recorded out of a total of more than 1.7 million robotic procedures carried out between January 2000 and December 2013.

That's less than a 0.1% failure rate on robotic surgeries (factoring in deaths and injuries, but not device malfunctions). I'd be curious to learn what the comparable rate is for human surgeons. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Recently came across this list (https://www.avelist.com/list/5-surprising-causes-of-adult-acne-and-inexpensive-solutions-18512), and while most of the items listed make sense to me, I was wondering if #1 was really an issue?

I talk on the phone for work a fair amount, and now I'm thinking that investing in a headset will not only help rest my arms/hands, but also help keep my face clear.

Curious to hear your thoughts/comments... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It also probably depends where in the US (or in the world) you live in. I'm a in a pet-friendly college town, so there's a lot less weight restrictions and plenty of single-floor/first-floor options. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, that's a fair assessment. I think most of those breeds do fall under or near 50 lbs, but it's definitely important to consider living situations (like you mentioned, stairs, etc.) :)

I would say this is just a starting point, not every dog here will be great in every situation...I think it's important to do a good bit of research on your intended dog type. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> While your dismissive and critical tone doesn't warrant a gracious response, here are my thoughts anyway:

You're incorrect about the Boxers needs. It's generally recommended for Boxers to receive 45-60 minutes of exercise a day (more is always better of course). [[1]](http://www.allboxerinfo.com/boxer-dog-exercise) [[2]](http://www.atlantaboxerrescue.org/exercise.html)

I never said **all** of those breeds have **all** of those characteristics. It's a wide mix of dogs that in some way or another have some suitability for a young adult. I think the linked videos give a great breakdown of each breed, so you can learn about the tradeoffs there.

I never claimed to be an expert. If you're an expert, good for you, you're allowed to dissent. My recommendation would be to do so more cordially in the future. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> While of course differing in looks/size, the breeds listed are similar in that they fit into some of the following categories: "friendly, easily trained, less vocal pooches with moderate activity needs".

Think of them as dogs that are lower down on the "maintenance requirements" list. I think the author's goal was to offer a widely varying selection of breeds :) </TEXT>
