	<TEXT> The Congressional Research Service found that the vast majority of unauthorized immigrants do not fit in the category that fits Trumps description: aggravated felons, whose crimes include murder, drug trafficking or illegal trafficking of firearms.

I don't disagree with the idea that we'd be better off with less illegal immigration. But it sure seems to me he's exaggerating the criminality of illegal immigrants in some rather heated language. And he's ignoring another group of criminals. The most frequent crime involving illegal aliens is employing them.  Somehow I rarely hear these secure borders advocates talk about cracking down on illegally hiring immigrants. Seems to me fewer employment opportunities for illegal immigrants would do a lot more to reduce their numbers than any wall on the border. </TEXT>

Another change made over the Fourth of July weekend eliminates the states long-standing living wage law and replaces all references to a living wage with minimum wage.

	<TEXT> I have two issuesv with your argument.  'Many Republicans like Rand Paul' doesn't consist of very many Republicans.  Only a [dismaying small percentage](http://www.businessinsider.com/10-percent-of-republicans-think-climate-change-is-human-caused-2015-7) of Republicans believe that climate change is caused by humans. Secondly, 'strong capitalism' isn't going to fix climate change by itself.  If you want a market based solution to climate change, you need to provide some incentives, some way to profit from addressing the problem.  There was support for that among republicans in the past (solutions like cap and trade), but it's virtually non-existent now. </TEXT>

A 2004 Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel investigation found the law would cost Wisconsin $1.8 billion dollars over 25 years and bring prison spending to par with the states university system.
