	<TITLE> The Acrolith, Part 2 </TITLE>

**1:01am**

Ive been hiding in my my house now for just over a day and it has been quite. I think I may be safe-ish from Rufus, or *The Acrolith* for the time being. Im guessing he, or *it* doesnt know exactly where I am, but I cant imagine him giving up on me. I havent slept or let the picture out of my sight. About an hour after I got home since the incident at Moss Hill I heard sirens of all types blaring past my apartment complex. But what is bothering me the most is there is no buzz about it. Nothing on social media, nor the local news. But I found this, an Acrolith is a sculpture made from stone and other materials such as wood. So I suppose that correlates with the disgusting stone arm, and terrifying monologue.

So I suppose there are two options for me:

1.) Hide here and hope to god that thing doesnt find me, then live the rest of my life in fear

2.) Try to fight back, most likely with this picture


By reaching out on the internet Ive found that my best option is to burn the photo. Im gonna throw in some salt and whatever holy, monster killing mumbo-jumbo I can think of. But first Im gonna try and get some shut eye, but I doubt that will happen. Wish me luck




**6:23am**

I dont know if it was restful enough to be called sleep, but whatever it was I was woken up from it by an email from someone using the address  *xDrzt7n@gld.n* . Now that adress brought me no where, but the anonymous sender did. They wrote:

	 You cant do a single thing to him, or any of them. Surrender all memory of him and your photo and you just might survive. Good luck.

This short message is more than a lot to take in. How the hell should I feel about that? According to this stranger I can give up my memory/memories to him along with the photo and be quote unquote survive? And what does he mean by them?! Are there more demon-freaks now?! Who the hell is this guy anyway?!

I sent a reply asking for elaboration, but got nothing in return. I felt like my time was running short. I decided to risk going back to the asylum. Not inside, but around the adress to get a look. So I threw my old binoculars around my neck. But I realized I should have the photo somewhere hard to reach on my person, where it would be safe. So I slipped it into my sneaker and went to my car.




**7:02am**

Its gone. The whole fucking building is gone. There no rubble or anything, even the driveway is gone. Its just... woods now. Am I in the right place? Whats the address again? Shit my head is **not** cooperating. What is happening to me?




**7:30am** 

I began to feel uncomfortable as I explored what I think is the lot. It started so faintly that I didnt even acknowledge it. But it began to grow painful, specifically in my foot. I panicked when I realized it was the foot that was in the same shoe as the photo. I almost broke my ankle tearing the shoe off in fear, but I didnt dare lose possession of the polaroid. Once the shoe was off I clamped my hand over the opening, in case rufus was nearby. Heat radiated out of my shoe like a space heater. So I plugged the hole in my shoe with a sock and threw it in my trunk.

Why the fuck is the photo hot? I dont know what to do at this point. Im going back to hiding.





**3:44pm**

He found me. For a split second my phone laptop and tv all switched to a view of my apartment complex from across the street behind. The image was looking up from a bus stop. Ive barricaded all doors and called the cops to report a break-in. Im in my bedroom with my gun (Yes I know it wont do me much good but Ill take my advantages where I can).




**3:59pm**

The building is beginning to, oh fuck I dont even know! *Morph* I guess. Its disgusting, the whole structure almost seems organic. The drywall is flowing and climbing on itself and making a horrible crackling and gurgling sound, it almost looks like its breathing. I can hear the other tenants freaking out in the rooms around mine. Its grown deeply cloudy outside and the polaroid is hot again.




**4:13pm**

Moments after the sirens arrived outside, The Acrolith finally spoke ***NO MEMORY OF ME SHALL REMAIN. I WILL CONSUME YOU. WE ARE ANCIENT*** his voice tore through my mind like bullets. Fuck this, Im so furious and terrified. Im gonna do it. Im uploading the photo for all of you to see, Then Im gonna burn it. I have no idea if this will do anything to him, but if you have the guts, please save the photo. Maybe even print it off and hide it somewhere. If its existence hurts him then I want you all to see it.

	<TEXT> Sadly no, I used Elun and Nova launcher. Elun is 0.99 and Nova launcher is free, but themes are fun for me so I am using paid features in that app to make it look more sleek. Nova paid is 5.99. I would recommend Min icon pack with the free version of nova If you want a nice minimalistic free theme. [This is what is capable with Min](http://imgur.com/o6Sumwy) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Part 2: https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3dzlvu/the_acrolith_part_2/


Countless google searches have brought me here to this forum. Never used reddit before, but I guess this is where people who have had experiences like myself accumulate. Ive never had to fear for my life before, despite my line of work and I dont know what to do. Running seems pointless due to my situation and the police are of no use. I dont feel in control of my own existance anymore. I feel like I'm going to be ripped apart.

Ive worked at the Moss Hill Institute for the criminally insane for just over 2 years now. I never went to college. But when you 66, 230 lbs, and own a security guard license; its easy enough to be hired as a guard. I used to enjoy guarding, its stressful, but rewarding work. But this is NOT what guarding should involve. I should never have been put anywhere near something like that without knowing about it. I swear if I make it out of this Im suing anyone I can. Fuck Moss Hill. I wish I never worked there.

 Well, I didnt always work there I used to work as a bouncer at a nightclub two towns over. When I heard about security work only about 20 minutes away, I was so deeply relieved. A job that didnt require 2 hours of driving every morning and every night. And an even better perk than a short drive was the fact that I got to work in the security room , monitoring the CCTV screens. easy-peasy. I had landed the job I was going to ride with all the way to retirement. Little did I know about the one person that would make that job hell. Rufus Baker.

Rufus Baker was not my angry boss. Nor my shitty co-worker. Rufus Baker was a patient in our mental hospital. I had heard his name at least 10 times on my first day. He was a high-profile patient kept in restraints at all times. Though no one really knew why. He had been there since he was a young adult. His origins were unknown. But we knew asking questions about Rufus was an easy way to get fired (That was in fact the reason for my position being open). He was a very thin, light skinned with thin grey hair. But, the most definitive feature of Rufus was his stoney grey eyes.

Rufus seldom stirred. And is he did stir it was to stare at a different part of his pale blue room. He looked at the wall as if he could see straight through them, to all corners of the building. When switching through the screens, I always seemed to come back to Rufus. He was our only patient kept in high security at all times, but in comparison to some of the other patients, he was completely harmless. Twice a day two people would come in and feed him and a Doctor would look at him and a little screen next to his bed, then write stuff on his clipboard and leave. Watching him was completely mundane and boring, but I couldnt stop. I had always been into mystery novels and the horror genre. So trying to figure him and some of the other interesting patients out was a lot of fun for me. 

Things began to change when I had done a routine check of all the cameras and went back to Rufus to see if he had changed positions. He had not. Bored with the cams I decided to try and draw Rufus (Im no artist, but doodling kills time). I pulled out my sticky notes and drowsily reached for a ball point pen to my right. I tried to pinch it between my fingers, but I realized there was no pen to grab. It was now about 5 inches from where I had originally saw it. Puzzled, I grasped at the pen again, it then skittered like a bug across the entire width of my desk, and fell down between the frame and the wall. I sat there for who knows how long in complete awe. I looked around for any sources to the pens movement, but found nothing. To make it even worse I couldnt reach the pen now because the desk was built into the floor.
	
I sat back down and laughed it off. I opened my desk and reached for a new box of pens and popped it open. Luckily these put up no fight I turned towards my sticky notes and scrawled on the top one was  ***DONT*** . Similarly to the pen incident, I searched for a source to the note, and found nothing. Due to my usual choice of media, I have a tendency to jump to conclusions and freak myself out. I calmed my senses and began to think rationally. This was a prank, it had to be. I shook it off thinking I would discover the source later.

And I did discover the source, but sooner rather than later. On screen was Rufus, looking straight at me. I felt shivers run down my spine and goose bump crawl down my arms. I got up and swiftly backed away from the screen. His stony eyes followed me the whole time as if we were in the same room. Very unsure of the situation, I fled the room to take a much needed coffee break. I had to clear my head, and get away from the screens. I thought it couldnt have been real, I was just sleep deprived. Or maybe I had too much to drink the day before? When I returned, I didnt switch back to rufus for the rest of the evening.

I was nervous to go to work the next morning. I actually had the phone in my hand at one point to call in sick, but I was also excited that something was finally happening with rufus. I finally felt like I was in a mystery novel. Ive spent my entire time at Moss Hill trying to figure Rufus out, and now I was starting to know why. But when I got to work I didnt even look at Rufuss cam until 4 hours in. And when I did he was just sitting there, as usual, like a statue. I was deeply discouraged, But something caught my eye, in the corner of his cell, were a pile of pens. My pens. All of my Pens were gone! I promptly got up, and let my boss know I was going home sick.

I didnt return to work for a few days. I instead used my time to try and figure out what to do about the whole situation Being a very superstitious person. I decided that it was most likely safer find a job as a mall cop, but I would regret dropping it for the rest of my life. So I did some research, and it came down to either I was crazy, or he had some form of telekinetic power. And he must not want his image recorded, at least on paper (I assumed this because he seemed to leave the video recordings alone). I wouldnt resort to telling my superiors about this yet, because when people get involved with him, usually results in their termination.

I brought a new pack of pens with me and an old polaroid camera, to test my theory of him not wanting to be on paper. I didnt let my bag containing my pens and camera out of my sight until I was ready to try it. I tried the pens first. I got a hold of them fine, they put up no fight. I started to circle back to my assumption that I was crazy until I discovered that I couldn't get a drop of ink out of any of them. This surprisingly made me excited. I reached down for the camera with shaky hands. As I aimed the viewfinder at the screen I saw Rufus slowly crane his neck in my direction (Or at least the direction of the camera in his cell). My heart was now beating like bass drum. I snapped the picture.

Almost instantly Rufus did something I don't think anyone has ever seen him do. He stood up. Not like how you think someone who has spent their life in bed would stand up either. He stood up swiftly in a single motion, pulling through his restraints like they were fashioned out of pipe cleaners and paper mache. All lights in the building began to flicker and dim. The building seemed to shake. Not shake like earthquake style, but like jiggling jello. It was like all of reality seemed to tremble. Everyone on the CCTVs seemed to react too. A deep voice rang in my head and shook my body to its core.
***I AM THE ACROLITH. BEFORE THERE WAS LIFE THERE WAS STONE. BEFORE THERE WAS STONE THERE WAS ME***
He jutted his arm out to the side in a violent manner, his stony eyes seemed to emit a deep, grey light. On one of the cams I saw something that straight out of a nightmare. A patient in the cafeteria began to grab at his torso like he had a bomb inside of him. Suddenly a giant, malformed, stone and wooden arm burst from his chest cavity.

The arm fluently grabbed another patient and threw him at a group of tables with incredible force. The poor man with the abomination jutting out of his chest collapsed to the ground and the arm went limp.
***YOU WILL NOT REMEMBER ME. I WILL CONSUME YOU***
I could now see that everyone heard and felt the voice. Patients and guards alike were holding their head on all of the video feeds. You could feel the presence of Rufus all throughout the building. It was like being in a sauna and having someone with a hot wet towel wrapped around your neck. I felt fatigue grip my whole body and I collapsed to my knees, then puked up what little I had eaten. When my senses returned I ran from the asylum faster than I thought possible.

So now here I sit at home on my little laptop holding my gun as closely as I can. 911 dispatch keeps brushing me off as a prank call, and I think Im going to die. But there is one thing I have that gives me confidence. I have a picture of him, and Im going to try and figure out why he doesn't want me to have it. </TEXT>

I have a 500gb HDD in my Gaming PC I built a while back. I just bought a 120gb SSD and want to make it my boot drive.

I intend on factory resetting my current harddrive using [this method](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RA1LSmLwEfI). (I thought doing this was better than installing windows on the ssd because I want it blank anyway)

Then Migrate my data to my SSD using [this method](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxNyDBSBNxg) and then configure it using [this method](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMo8krAJd5Q).

Is this a good Idea?

The way he leaves the fiery cracks on the board when he is played is awesome. I think it would be super satisfying if legendaries had a  small effect around them when they were played that stayed there until they died.  </TEXT>

That or people modding the game in ways which the developer doesn't want. Which I don't think the developer should care too much about. </TEXT>
