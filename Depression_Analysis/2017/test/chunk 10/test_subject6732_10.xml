I watched the movie... and hated it, especially because of such a heartbreaking climax. I like Stephen King very much. Will i be able to enjoy the book of the movie that I hated?? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I finished the book at around 2 AM and today is also my birthday.

Starting with the idea of having a dog as the narrator to the way it sees the mankind, their relationships, their emotions and its own, their lifestyle, the satire, its persona... all these have hit the chord and the book has filled great many places in my heart. I recommend the book to anybody who love to read something sensible about life from time to time.

**EDIT:** Ok. That was a small math mistake of mine. It was my 17th birthday. I guess I was too excited about my 18th birthday that I added year to the actual 17th. Sorry, my bad :)

	<TEXT> I would recommend people to read atleast one book about nature and environment each year.  I strongly believe that we should pay attention to the planet's grave perils such as climate change and global warming which are being caused because of us. These problems deserve to be known.

*Walden* by Henry David Thoreau would give you a kick-ass start.. and then there is lot of non-ficiton about the subject. Am currently reading *The Sixth Extinction* by Elizabeth Kolbert. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Just take one day off from your daily fapping routine and keep yourself off from all the usual thoughts. Do whatever is possible to keep yourself busy and productive for that one day. Meditate. Read. Dance. Sing. Roam. Eat. Paint.. do anything but masturbation, or even spend the whole day dreaming and imagining yourself as the person you want to be in life. Live one day like that. And see if you like it. Ask yourself if you want to experience more of such days... and you know what, you already have the answer. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> From:

 I used to fap like twice a day and incest was the only thing which gave me the pleasure.

to:

 Now, after reaching nofap, I fap like once in a week or so and I am in total control of it.

That's quite a good change. Many people here might disagree with your new fapping routine, but I completely agree. After all, the purpose of NoFap community is not just helping people get over their fapping addictions, but also helping them do it in a way that they think is best for them. So, you're fine there.

Even I, before I knew of NoFap, used to take long gaps from masturbation whenever I got bored or lost flavour in M sessions. The rarity of the event itself makes it much more enjoyable for me. The titillations that I get, now and then, when I keep myself away from M for a long while, like more than 10 days or so is very pleasurable. And when I do it after such desire and titillation filled arousal, oh it simply is an inexplicable feeling.

	<TEXT>  I can tell you biweekly relapses (once every two weeks) aren't the most effective way in tackling NoFap.

Looking at what the OP said in the post, I don't think he is *relapsing*. He is quite clear that he took up NoFap by deciding to fap once in 10 to 20 days, so I think his new fapping schedule need not be counted as relapse. I belive that relapse to this OP means fapping again like he used to do before, very frequently and only to those incest fantasies during all those times. </TEXT>

I mean, having a girlfriend and having sex with her before marriage is not a norm here, moreover it is seen as a very indecent thing in most of the households. So, unable to have actual sexual experiences at regular intervals, we tend towards porn. So, if we take up NoFap, it almost always ends up as a Hardmode. </TEXT>

**A Breathtaking Sight**

I stood there enchanted

under the umbrella of cosmic light

and witnessed a spectacle undaunted

that showcased the beauty's magic and might.


*"What is it, that sharp light?"*

I asked myself, with a wondering heart

A voice spoke to me from that very sight

and the heavens answered, *" 'tis our master's everlasting art."*

	<DATE> 2015-07-09 08:01:27 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> HI BROTHERS.. LONG TIME. HOW ARE Y'ALL??

IN THE LAST FEW WEEKS I'VE BEEN PRETTY FUCKED UP IN MY HEAD. LOT OF OVERWHELMING EXPERIENCES IN MY DAILY LIFE. SOME DEPRESSING AND SOME ENCOURGAING. BUT MOST OF THEM HAVE ENDED UP WINNING IN MAKING ME FEEL LOW EVERY MORNING. 

I DIDN'T LIKE THAT. I'M SCORNING THE FUCKING FEELING OF WAKING UP TO THE MISERABLE THOUGHTS ON LIFE AT EVERY SUNRISE. 

I WANT TO THE CHANGE THE FUCK OUT OF IT. I WANT TO CONCENTRATE MY MIND ON THE INTERESTING ASPECTS OF MY LIFE RATHER THAN ON THE GLOOMY ONES. SO I DECIDED TO LIST OUT WHAT ARE THE THINGS THAT MAKE MY LIFE INTERESTING AND NON-INTERESTING AND THEN SHIFT MY FOCUS ON TO THE GOOD ONES.
 SO HERE IT GOES -

**INTERESTING ONES:**

* READING BOOKS (I LOVE THIS. BUT I FEEL LIKE I NEED TO LOVE THIS SOME MORE)
* READING NON-FICTION BOOKS AND WRITING THEIR SUMMARIES TO BETTER REMEMBER THE STUFF LEARNED (THIS IS A NEW THING I JUST TOOK UP)
* STUDYING MATH  (I WON'T TALK ABOUT THAT)
* WRITING FICTION AND POETRY (THIS IS THE PUREST BLISS OF MY LIFE)
* NOFAP CHALLENGE (NOT AN ADDICT THOUGH, BUT WANTED TO TEST MY MIND'S CONTROL LEVELS AGAIN - LAST TIME DID 131 DAYS IN HARD MODE)
* TRYING TO IMPROVE MY PUBLIC SPEAKING SKILL (THIS IS VITAL FOR SOMETHING I PLANNED FOR MY FUTURE)
* WRITING INFORMAL LOG ENTRIES FOR EACH DAY (INSPIRED FROM THE NOVEL [*THE MARTIAN*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Martian_%28Weir_novel%29) BY ANDY WEIR)
* STUDYING/RESEARCHING ABOUT ENVIRONMENTALISM (CURRENTLY READING A BOOK: [*THE SIXTH EXTINCTION*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sixth_Extinction_%28book%29) BY ELIZABETH KOLBERT, WILL SOON PICK UP A BOOK ON *GLOBAL WARMING* - **BECAUSE FUCK GLOBAL WARMING**)
* ALGORITHMS, MAN. I NEED TO STUDY SOME REALLY IMPORTANT ALGORITHMS IN MACHINE LEARNING AND DATA ANALYTICS

**NON-INTERESTING ONES** (THINGS I'M NOT LIKING IN MYSELF):

* BEHAVING SOMETIMES LIKE A GODDAMN LOSER 
* NOT STICKING TO MY DETERMINED CHANGES IN LIFESTYLE

	<TEXT> Change the names. Otherwise the book becomes too much alive for those people and, in the long run, to you too. You're still very young, so let's say you've written a memoir using the original names of those people, and later in your life, due to some obvious and unfortunate reasons if the relationship between you and any of those people becomes a bit shaky, then the book might start to carry a lot of different and disappointing aura and meaning around it: when you read those lines again using the original names, and when you know the reality behind it has changed away forever, you will start feeling the void in your own words.  So, it is highly advisable to change the names. This would atleast leave a version of reality untouched forever in the form of the book.

Why I'm telling this is because of a minor personal experience I went through. I had once written something very nice for a person, and at the time the work meant a great deal to me, but later when I faced some opinion mismatches with the person, the kind of sense I had towards my words in that work changed. It started to act as an eternal reminder of what was not. I didn't like it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Non-fiction books are something of a knowledge repository. Currently I'm reading *The Sixth Extinction* by Elizabeth Kolbert. The book is quite interesting and has some really great things told about some of the species that have gone extinct, the causes behind those extinctions and other such vital data was discussed. 

After reading three chapters into the book, I realized that I'm not able to remember every little detail about the things explained in the book since its beginning. So, I decided to write chapter wise summaries in a Word document. 

I would just like to know about how do you guys keep track of the things that a book teaches you? Once time passes by humans tend to forget a lot of stuff, so how do we take care of such data loss from our minds, data that we collected by doing the hard work of reading many great books?

It's not particularly technical at all. I would say somewhere around 1 on the scale of 5. The book has won Pulitzer Prize for Best Non-Fiction, so it is assumed that the book was written for the general lay public, like you and me. Do try picking it up, it's quite a interesting and worthy read. </TEXT>

And the first thing I ever read that's written by Neil Gaiman, and which in turn made me fall in love with him, was [this writing advice post on his Tumblr.](http://neil-gaiman.tumblr.com/post/107713982316/i-have-been-trying-to-write-for-a-while-now-i) That's just a pure and fantastic genius of a mind he is.

	<TEXT> **The Sixth Extinction, by Elizabeth Kolbert**

I picked it up after seeing it recommended by Bill Gates on his [gatesnotes](http://www.gatesnotes.com/Books/The-Sixth-Extinction) blog. Also, recently, moved by hundreds of deaths that are caused due to the overheat in my country's (India) climate, I've taken up an interest in studying the perils humans are causing to the environment. This book is quite interesting and captivating in talking of the extinctions that happend in the evolution of the Earth. </TEXT>

(Also, I love those erections that I get after not fapping for a long while... those tempting titillations are sometimes better than having an orgasm - and such *long while*s are possible only through NoFap challenge.)

	<TITLE> Yesterday I watched the revealing documenraty 'Going Clear' about The Church of Scientology. What do you guys think of L.Ron Hubbard, that a writer had founded such a cult that made some people ecstatic while immensely troubling others? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-07-06 06:28:16 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I didn't know that the founder of Church of Scientology, L. Ron Hubbard held a Guinness Record for the number of books he wrote (more than a 1000 books). In the documentary Going Clear, they've told about how he tortured his wife and the kind of financial views with which started the new religion of Scientology, and also his stature, arrogance and demeanour while giving interviews or while on the ship with other members of the church and many, many other such instances repelled me very badly. 

I wasn't least bit impressed that he was a prolific writer of so many books because of how the Church of Scientology turned out in the lives of a large number of its past members, who were physically and psychologically abused to great degrees, and  tortured by punishments such as licking the bathrooms with their tongue, throwing a person on the floor and kicking him cruelly in the name of teaching lessons for their wrong doings against the teachings of the church... and also how they tell the members to completely disconnect from their family members who do not believe in the church... all of this has just gave me a very negative opinion on LRH and his church of scientology.

What do you guys think about this entire concept and how the church of scientology treats people who seem to be future threats to the church's reputation?

If you don't mind me asking, can you please PM me your flash fiction blog? I would like to check it out and take whatever help from it.

Thanks :) </TEXT>
