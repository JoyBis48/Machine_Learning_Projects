	<TEXT> I love AEON NOX. I won't use any skin without home screen customizations amd custom buttons. I use smart Playlists to organize my TV shows. I have one category that only shows TV shows I've tagged as anime, and one for kids cartoons. Then I have a Playlist that shows all TV shows except for a young contained in the anime or cartoon Playlists, that way my base TV show list doesn't just have every single TV show </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I wonder if we're getting to the point where we won't be seeing significant meaningful improvements in phones year after year. The only thing I can really see that has a lot of room to improve is battery life.. But as far as screen resolution and processor speed, and storage space, not so much. 

I feel like the only reason the M9 is getting panned is because of the M7 and M8. A lot of people felt that the M8 wasn't much of an upgrade from the M7,even though the M8 is a fantastic phone. I'm seeing the same thing going from M8 to M9. The M9 is a great phone but that's two generations in a row where people felt that the next iteration wasn't a significant upgrade from the last </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I feel like I've read this before. 

Also as someone who works sales, I recommend you tell customers of the place to ask the place to put their menu online. Stores are always apprehensive about new things and since you're presenting them with this idea or tool, even if it's completely free, they feel you have something to gain from it that they're missing out on.

If enough customers or sometimes even just one regular customer requests it, that puts the power in their hands to do it because the customers are wanting it. I've had stores order things I didn't have any intention of selling to them because it wasn't something that did well but a customer wanted it so they ordered it </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It isn't always so bad. One time I went to buy a new wallet and couldn't decide between two that I liked. I decided to get both and decide at home because I didn't have all day to stand there. I'd just take the one I liked less back. Well each wallet was like 20-25 base price and we're something like 20% off. So I was expecting to pay $30-40 for the two. Well little did I know, there was an additional sale where if you bought items whose base price was 40-50 in one transaction, you got an additional percentage off your final total. Long story short, I kept both wallets because buying both ended up being cheaper than buying a single one on sale. I don't recall seeing any decent wallets for less than $10 when I was there during the no sale period  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I *hate* the diagnosis after a 5 minute conversation type deal. My wife has been through a lot the last couple of years and only in the last year was she able to find the right therapist for her and the end of last December she found a fantastic psychiatrist through her therapist. 

Her previous doctors were giving her bogus diagnoses after 5 minute discussions without really working with her, one had said it "sounds like you may have bipolar but I don't want to make that diagnosis because it's difficult to treat". Sounded more like she didn't want to spend the time actually doing anything other than collecting a paycheck. 

But when she scheduled an appointment with this psychiatrist she had to do a 70 minute questionnaire with him and they ended up talking for about 3 hours before he diagnosed her with bipolar (I believe II). But they started working with medication and he had her on a mood stabilizer but she was still rapid cycling after a week so he had her on an anti-psychotic for a month and ever since she's been really stable with the mood stabilizer  </TEXT>
