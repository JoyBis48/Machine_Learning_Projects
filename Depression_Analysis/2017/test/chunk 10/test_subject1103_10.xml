No one cares if you read or not. I will forget about you in 5 seconds, and so will everyone else in a few hours. I like it when people don't read. It makes my life easier.  </TEXT>

First she was on an internship then started dating some ashole in medical school, then she goes crazy and gets sent the asylum.But I'm not sure why Joan was there at the end, and how she killed herself. Ending is confusing, anyone wish to explain? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Never been to those states, but I live in CA, and in summer it's about 95-100 degrees most of the time. The difference is CA is just hot  where as Japan is humid. You feel sticky and that is what makes you feel the hottest. I've  never used an umbrella  for the sun, before either but there's a first for everything.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Unfortunately you lack discipline, unless you have a mental stigma. There is no teaching this, as you will have to endeavor this yourself. My best advice is to travel, every new country I visit, my lust grows for reading. You just have to find your beat and follow the rhythm.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I started reading when I was 17, but gave it up at 19 when University and work started to take my time away from me, as the internet did as well, but you know what made me read again? Not having access to the internet. As banal as that advice sounds it works. I am 19 currently studying abroad in Japan, and I have no access to the internet most of the time, but I took a book with me even though I don't have the habit, I still enjoy reading - this contradicts itself, but I take a book with me, in a case where I do actually read it. However, I find myself constantly at a coffee shop or park bench reading. It's so amazing when you don't have the internet in your ear, or worrying about Facebook. You really need to travel to get the urge in you again, that's how I see it. Or just cancel your internet to rekindle the connection, otherwise you're just going to go on the internet instead of picking up a book.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Usually when a person is mean, it's due to "projection". When an individual projects a certain attitude leads to many possible solutions; in this case, I'm using the internet as a way to vent my loneliness. I figured it out, but there is little I can do without continuing the vicious cycle. "I'm sorry" is an ideal apology, but I will do it again tomorrow, so what's the point?
