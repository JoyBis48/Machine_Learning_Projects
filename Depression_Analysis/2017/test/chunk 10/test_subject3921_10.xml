	<TEXT> Simply just think it is a beautiful movie. The cinematography is phenomenal as well as the acting. Also love how it is about everything, such as knowing your place in the world, how others view you, what an ego can do, and mostly love how it explains what is flawed about modern blockbusters and movie goers and how most Michael Bay type explosion extravaganzas are just pointless cash grab, but Birdman really is a piece of art in my opinion that I have been waiting a long time to see. Hopefully that answered your question! </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Why is "Cars" so widely disliked? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> I like the Pixar movie "Cars". It's not my favorite Pixar movie of all time but I definitely do not think it is shit or isn't up to par on Pixar's usual films. I thought the movie was about much more than just winning a big race. To me it was about a full of himself race car who discovers how to be humble, grateful, and makes some quality friendships that he never would have made prior to his entering of Radiator Springs. That's just my opinion on the movie I simply want to know why some people don't care for it. Cars 2 was shit though. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It bothers me a lot when it is used an excessive amount. If you see Ted 2, there is an obscene amount of product placement in that movie.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It kept me entertained from start to finish and the last thirty minutes of the movie felt like authentic Jurassic Park and it had the best ending I could have possibly hoped for. I had no problems with the acting, at some points the CGI looked a little cheesy but still did not take away from the film in my opinion. Were there some flaws? Yes. In the grand scheme of things did I think it was a solid action movie that excited me almost as much as Jurassic Park? Absolutely.  </TEXT>
