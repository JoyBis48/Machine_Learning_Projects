	<TEXT> I made an ice cream cake (two vanilla cakes with some strawberry ice cream in between) and it is currently in my freezer setting up in a spring form pan. I want to put some icing on it and maybe practice decorating, but I don't know what will freeze well. My roommates are gone for another week but there's no way I'm waiting for them to get started on this thing. So my question is what icing will hold up to being taken in and out of the freezer while I slowly devour this cake over the course of the next week or two? Will buttercream be okay? Thank you. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have a Polar FT4 and after about 7 months of use it started giving me erratic readings (ave hr of 45, max 205 for a steady state day on the water) but I machine wash it once a week and it now works fine. So whatever you buy make sure you wash that chest strap. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A couple of people I know really like them, but I'm not a big fan. The first few times I sculled with them was in bad weather, and it really irritated my wrists and forearms. I had tendonitis in my wrists a couple of years ago, and it felt like the extra effort it took to square and feather started to bring that back, especially in the choppy water. I try to avoid them just to keep my wrists happy but better and more experienced scullers than me really like them. </TEXT>
