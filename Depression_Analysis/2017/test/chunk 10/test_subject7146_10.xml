	<TEXT> Ok, let me explain this to you in a way you might understand. See, the video was taken with a device that is known as a "smart phone", "iphone", "android", or something along those lines. When they shot the video they were holding their device vertically (that means up and down, not side to side) and so the result is a tall, skinny video. (Bonus fact: if you hold the device sideways, it will take pictures and videos that actually look right on screens.) So when the video is shown on a short, wide screen, there's nothing for the sides, usually they're just left black. But rather than  showing black, some folks will extend (extend means stretch) the edges out, or show a blurry piece of the video so it's less distracting (distracting means it draws attention away from where you're supposed to be looking.)   

Sorry about the big words. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> lol I just noticed you posted in Straight Talk, sorry. Well Straight Talk has terrible customer service. I kept getting the Indian folk who could only read back from their computers, they had no real knowledge or power outside of what they see on their monitors. I did some Googling and finally found a number that got me American support. They had actual knowledge and was able to help me with my activation. I was able to buy an activation kit (really just bought a code)  over the phone, and got me going. I would assume an unlocked phone would work, but it might take a bit of effort to get going.  </TEXT>

I felt a little wrong getting it, and don't do things like that anymore, but the girl saw the readout, looked at the box, gave me a look, and let me have it. So I didn't feel too much like a thief. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Slippery slope there. If changing the functionality of the game using knowledge gleaned outside of the game isn't cheating, then they should go ahead and let us level up weapons. It's all the same, using something outside of skill to gain an advantage over other players.  
That's my outlook on it, anyway.

It's easier to ask once, and get responses from folks who know what you mean no matter your wording or nuance, than to hunt through Google hits searching for your solution. Which isn't a bad thing at all. It's when a simply worded search suffices to bring up a page full of answers that bugs me. You simply drop your legwork into someone else's lap. Er,  not you as in you, you as in anyone. You know what I mean.  </TEXT>
