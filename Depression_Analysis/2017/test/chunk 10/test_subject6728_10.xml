	<TEXT> I sadly have to agree, it's one of the reasons i am afraid to say i'm a Portuguese player.

I think it's because they still haven't left that "roleplaying-phase" we all had, where the first characters everyone usually made were terrible anime cliches or bland copies of other media.

We all leave that phase but it has to be by our own accord, can't force it and you can't ask your weaboo friends to help you because showing up at a dnd table with Sasuchigo the demon shinigami who's destiny is to save the world and then get mad when people when they try to explain how things work and how they don't.

(this has happened to me some times it does not end well)

i could go on to explain in more detail but i don't wanna fill this thing up without good reason. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Portugal has a very small community mostly Dnd, pathfinder(Implying it's not dnd) and V:TM.

I have seen one rpg that was made by Portuguese people and it's about children who were commissioned by death to rapture souls of other people in turn for a chance at heaven i believe.
It's darker than it sounds. </TEXT>
