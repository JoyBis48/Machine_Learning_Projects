But I guess, good job on having a marginally higher population than the second most populated metro area in your state, I guess?

PS Houston has more people than Dallas.

	<TEXT> Smith is the kind of guy who needs boundaries, structure and supervision to succeed. When he went to Detroit, he went into an environment where he was given almost free reign over himself. It was easy to look at him in that situation and think, "well, here's a horse who can never be tamed, who does what he wants, who doesn't care where his hoofs land."

Yes, Smith is a wild stallion at heart; and all wild stallions can be tamed, though not everyone can tame one.

The Rockets were in the perfect situation to tame him, to put a saddle on him, and to man the reins.

For Smith to reign supreme, he needs the reins of a *team*.    </TEXT>

	<TEXT> i mean, yeah. it's a bigger number. it's a big number. i don't think it represents a bigger impact on the game than boogie's night. i just think that at the end of the day, 50 is flashier and more noticeable to the average person.

i mean, this thread has 260 comment versus 66 in the Cousin's stat line thread. kinda speaks for itself.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I somewhat agree, however Harden also had 8rb/6a/3stl. I think they're both equally impressive individual performances but 51 points is simply flashier. Boogie had a monster game though, he looked like a superstar.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Across the board, I wouldnt Curry's numbers are head and shoulders above Westbrook or Harden's. They all are posting MVP caliber seasons purely from a statistical standpoint and they all make worthy candidates.

 I think at the end of the season, the votes are going to come down more to "what they think they did with what" - do they prefer Harden leading a challenge for the SW division title and 2nd seed with an extreme dearth of normal starter minutes logged; Westbrook with triple doubles left and right, a nasty bark and nastier bite and a taste for upset on his tongue; or Curry, putting up one of the most beautifully efficient exhibitions of guard play in ages, on one of the most dominant and successful teams the regular season has witnessed?

I think it's gonna be very close, with Harden or Curry taking it home.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It confuses me that the attitude towards Harden isn't the attitude that is expressed towards Westbrook; they even take the same amount of FTA per game (never hear his FTA mentioned). Harden is just a silly, fun loving guy while Westbrook is the kind of guy you don't want to invite to happy hour.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Curious now what the average length of a Rockets game is vs. other teams. Can't be that substantial and Harden is a quick FT taker. I mean, the Rockets average 25 FT (4th in the league) and only take 6 more FT per game than the lowest FTA team (Knicks at 19) - so there isn't much of a spread in FTA between teams. 6 FTs take, what, an extra 3 minutes of game time? Max? </TEXT>
