	<TITLE> The new noise just before the nexus blows up needs changing... </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-07-10 12:44:13 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Since the last patch, every time the nexus blows up there's a new explosion noise played.

Here's my plight with the new sound; I play a lot of Zed and at the end of a game, just before we're about to win and blow up the nexus i like to quickly type "/j" (the joke emote) in which Zed says "Forbidden shadow wins!". HOWEVER since the new explosion noise has been added to the nexus blowing up, it muffles Zed's voice! This is absolutely game breaking

Riot i will be writing a strongly worded letter to your player support team each day until this is fixed. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> there's no secret to gaining elo it's really just a case of working on what you already know like CS well, dont back when your mid laner is roaming (if you play mid that is), dont go for a kill unless you're 100% sure it'll be a success. It really is just a case of working on what you know and making small tweaks constantly. Oh and LOOK AT YOUR MAP MORE YOU DONT DO IT ENOUGH </TEXT>
