"Oh he shook the marine's hand!  Terrible presidential protocol!"
"Oh my god, he fucking BOWED to a jap and respected their culture!!  How unamerican!!"

Before he even started actually doing the stuff they were truly angry about, like talking about torture, Gitmo, gay rights, DADT, and healthcare.

And now you're angry at everyone for not jumping on your bandwagon.  We hated the last CEO towards the end of her tenure after she did a bunch of stupid shit.  This guy hasn't even done anything yet.  Nothing.

Oh wait, he talked about doing something.  Totally the same thing, my bad. </TEXT>

So, if I have a $100 bankroll, I bet a flat 10% on my bets.  But that doesn't mean that my unit is $10, right?  Cause that 10% will cause the bet amount to change daily.
