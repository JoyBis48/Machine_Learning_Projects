The NFL is easily the most injury-inducing, particularly of the career ending and mentally impairing variety , sport in America, yet its the only one that doesn't provide players with post-career health insurance. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I can only see technology improving safety by changing the style of helmets, something that would limit the movement of the head/neck areas. Something like this would probably limit each players range of motion, possibly resulting in less acrobatic plays. I don't see Defenses ever going back to the older style of hitting at this point, the trajectory the league is on is to make hits less violent, I don't see that trend changing, whether or not its better/worse for the game.

-To your second point, like you said everyone believes Bran and Rickon to be dead. It would be a stretch for a bastard to claim the throne of Winterfell, but at this point he's the last remaining Stark.

-The reader is meant to be unsure about Clegane. Most would assume he's dead, but many are also hoping he somehow survived, we don't know at this point in the story.

Congrats on finishing the book, its a tome so don't feel bad that it took a long time.

No matter how bad the job might be, working regularly is a great source of pride and independence. You'll find just doing this for a small period of time will make your realize how capable you are and open up other avenues to you. Having an ambition to be a comic book writer/artist is awesome, and its something that can be pursued and developed in your free time. There's a lot of good resources out there on where to begin with something like that.

I'd suggest going on Craigslist and seeing what's available, start narrowing it down from there. </TEXT>
