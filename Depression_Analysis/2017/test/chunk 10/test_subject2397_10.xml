	<TEXT> So in the store you will notice TV's playing stupid commercials about products they carry. These have been around for awhile, but recently they installed newer monitors that have what appear to be webcams at the top of the screen. I'm assuming they're for facial recognition software, but I just though I'd let you all become aware of this latest installation.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This was really just a strange episode. I like the Robin Sparkles videos but to have a whole fake documentary on a character was kindof pushing it big time. It's awesome they got all those cameos but it also felt like a bit of a waste of their talent to say one line. Just more weird attributes to Robin's character

Also why would they ruin the whole Marshal Lily story like that? For the sole reason of justifying what Ted is doing by being a stalker? Had they seriously ran out of that many ideas at that point? Seemed totally unnecessary to make Ted feel better </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Pretty douche move by Brad, which is too bad because I always thought he was funny throughout the show even though we don't see much of him. 

There must be like, 5 episodes where we see that Ted is apparently the only reason Marshal and Lily are together. And everytime it's used as some justifiable thing for something he does wrong, like with the birthday picture plot earlier in the show with Lily </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Why would they not make Ted the godfather instantly? Lily and Marshal would never ever choose Barney to be a godfather, seriously. And then of course they all 3 are at the end, just like they were co-best men.  I know it's just a show but when it's this completely unrealistic with the gameshow and cheesy music it just makes it kinda cringeworthy </TEXT>
