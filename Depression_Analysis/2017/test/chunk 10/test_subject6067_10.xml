Sales have been climbing for us every month since March, but suddenly I'm finding June to be really slow.  Is it just me lol? This is our first year in retail so I have no idea what types of sales trends are normal.  Thank you ahead of time! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi everyone!  My husband and I finally were able to get a plot in our community garden (yayyyyy)!  We've never gardened before (outside of succulents grown in containers on our balcony), so we're unsure of what we should do next.  Currently there are things growing in our plot, but I really want to pull everything out, build some raised beds, and start growing some delicious vegetables.  

Here is an instagram photo of what's currently growing in our plot: https://instagram.com/p/1RT2cNkMgd

We are in Zone 10a :)

Thank you for your help!! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi everyone! I have a large round pedestal table already and would like to make a few smaller cake stands to stack on top just like the pink ones in the picture. I figured I could purchase the round wooden plates pre-cut from Home Depot, but I can't seem to find the legs. I have seen a few thick candle holders, but nothing tall enough. Any help would be appreciated! Thank you DIY :)

	<TITLE> My 1 week experience with the Surge </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-01-02 08:27:06 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hey guys! My husband bought me a Fitbit Surge for Christmas and I thought Id let you know my experience wearing it so far. 

Band: The band is thick on my wrist, but its quite comfortable.  The closure is like a regular watch so theres no need to worry about it undoing itself.  There is also a piece that slips over the extra watch flap and locks it down. This way you dont have to worry about all that extra watch band hanging over if your wrist is thin.  Ive been wearing it all day and only taking it off to shower. So far I havent experienced the gross smell that most watch bands usually give.

Clock face:  Its big and very easy to navigate.  The backlight is great, but I have found myself tapping it a few times at night for the light to come on.  The swiping is easy, but sometimes I find that its displaying other screens except for the time.  Im sure its because Ive touched it on accident or something.  Perhaps there is a way to lock the screen on clock?

Music control: Love running spotify on my phone and being able to control it with my watch.  

Text/Call notification:  I have yet to receive a single text on my watch.  I have however been notified 1 out of 10 incoming calls.  Ive reset it once so maybe I'll have to do it again. 

Heart rate: I havent tested the accuracy, but its been pretty fun to see what my heart rate is throughout the day and night.  I have noticed that on some nights my pulse is 10 points lower than on other nights.  Is that normal? 

GPS: The GPS is a little wacky.  Ive only used it 2x but both times the google map drawing was completely off.  Ill use it a few more times before I write to fitbit.  

*Battery: Charging seems to only take an hour, but man does this thing have a terrible battery life.  I charged it till it was full yesterday afternoon and it's already showing that it's 1/2 way through right now.  Is this happening to anyone else with the Surge?  I'm so sad because when I wore the Force it seemed it last forever! 

Thats it so far.  If you guys have any questions Id be more than happy to answer them :)

*edited to add the note on battery life </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi guys, the last 3 days my iphone 5 has suddenly been having problems with my home wifi.  I thought it was because I hadn't upgraded to the new iOS, but since I've upgraded it's still been the same.  Either I don't see my wifi, connect for a minute then it drops, or it's painfully slow.  I've tried to reset network settings, change my DNS to 8.8.8.8, turn off location settings, and a bunch of other online suggestions I've found.  I don't know why things have gotten so bad overnight while all the other devices in this house seems the same.  Any help would be appreciated.  Thank you :) </TEXT>
