 I loved the show. I loved the characters. I loved the music. I was tremendously sad when it was cancelled. 

But I don't think I ever said, "I wonder what happens on Treme tonight" because I really didn't care what happened. I just wanted to pop open a beer and spend an hour with Antoine Batiste, Albert Lambreaux and the rest of the gang. 

I lot of people have problems with a show like that, so they didn't watch it.

Think about the MASH finale. 125 million people watched that show. over 60% of all households in the US were tuned in. If there was an apotheosis for the mass media, that was it.  

Remember, that was in the days of three broadcast networks and very little else of note. Cable was in its infancy. The VCR was just starting to catch on. If you weren't watching one of the big three, you were probably watching old movies or re-runs.

The only thing that compares to that now is the Superbowl.

	<TEXT> They've been talking about it for over a year now. It's a pretty serious proposal and doesn't require approval by congress, so I expect some version of it, maybe not the full salary bump, will go into effect some time before the end of Obama's term. 

I expect that a lot of organizations like yours, that rely on abusing low-paid, exempt employees, will have serious issues when it goes into effect.

Hours are hours, even if the task load isn't onerous. In my job, there's often time not a lot of work to actually do, but I have to be there and be attentive to the situation. Stretches without significant off time can be very wearing.

Can you push back on the events some? Either that or just start giving everyone, including yourself, days off mid-week? 

Also, if you're working so hard that you're sleeping on the office couch you need to stop that shit right now. You will seriously damage yourself and that's not going to help anyone.  

Sometimes for things to get fixed, you have to let them break. You working yourself and your staff like crazy to keep all the plates balanced is justr putting a band-aid on things. Maybe you need to call in sick for a few days and let things take their natural course.

Good luck!

	<TEXT> Can you bring your concerns to the board? Speak with each of them individually and express your concern?

From the sound of it, things will probably fly apart there once the new FLSA rules for exempt employees go into effect. All of the low level exempt employees who have been worked hard to keep things running will have to be either bumped up to the new exempt minimum ($970/wk) or be paid hourly.

In the meantime, you need to establish boundaries. You can't work yourself sick because there's not enough staffing. Work a reasonable amount and then go home. If things don't get done or fall by the wayside, so be it. As important as the work you're doing might be, it's not as important as your physical or mental health, The same goes for your staff.

There's probably not a good long-term solution here, so I'd think about planning your exit strategy now. </TEXT>

If you want to, you can start documenting your interactions with Jane. Keep track of the work you've done for her and all the times you've helped her. You might even think about sending your boss e-mails with reports couched as status updates. Something like, "Just FYI: Did my ten TPS reports this week and, as per your instructions, I did the eight assigned to Jane as well".

Will this help? Probably not. 

The best thing you can do for yourself is get your resume together and start looking for a new job. Maybe if enough actual workers leave, the company will figure out what's going on.  </TEXT>

Two important things:

* Don't ever ever EVER work off the clock. As an hourly employee you must be paid for every minute you work for the company. Unpaid work is theft. Don't let them bully you into working for free.

* Don't do anything that you feel is unsafe. No job is worth getting injured for.

Otherwise, try and figure out when to put your head down and take it and when to stand up for yourself.

It's not cringey bad or particularly stupid or annoying. It's a breezy 90 minutes with a bunch of minion business for the kids, a few jokes for the adults and a nice sixties vibe that plays pretty well, all things considered.

It is incredibly lazy. There's really no story or point to anything. Just a lot of running around and silliness and then it ends.

It made me think of some of the interviews Pete Docter gave about Inside/Out. Apparently the early versions of the script had a lot of funny bits with Joy and Fear, but it didn't go anywhere and didn't have much of a point to it. He worked on it constantly for months after that trying to crack it.

Whereas, when the Minons team got to the point they obviously just said, "Fuck it, good enough" and called it a day. </TEXT>

Also, he was accused of more than just downloading science journals. He caused quite a bit of trouble for the MIT computer staff and his shenanigans have changed the way that people on MIT networks may access JSTOR.

Finally, sad as his death was, there's no evidence that his suicide was related to his prosecution. Swartz was a troubled young man who suffered from depression. He left no note or other indication of why he ended his life.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't remember Blade Trinity being all that bad, although truthfully I don't remember much of it. 

I do remember watching it over at this chick's apartment and, in the opening scene the title says "Syria" and there's a sweeping aerial shot of the desert and it stops on this giant, pyramid thing. The girl I was with stands up and yells at the screen, "There are no ziggurats like that in Syria! There are no ziggurats like that in Syria!"

In that moment I knew that someday she would be my wife.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't know. I never bought or sold anything there. Redditors on other threads have said it worked well for them.

Thing is, I have no problem with Reddit closing the marketplace. Sometimes you try something new and eventually you realize that it's not really working or it's not profitable or a distraction from your core competency or whatever. I don't think there's any moral imperative to keep services up and running forever. 

But, if you're going to close it down, give people some notice for fucks sake. Let people have at least a little time to work out a transition plan. What kind of shit-tastic organization shuts down a bunch of online stores without giving anyone any notice at all? </TEXT>

The people who run the site have show that they'll do whatever they like, without reason or notice, and if people are inconvenienced, unhappy or otherwise left hanging, that's their own issue.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As a Hymie from Hymie Town (actually Hymie Island, east of Hymie Town), I was never a big fan of the Reverend Jackson. I always saw him as a self-important, self-aggrandizing, blowhard. But this makes him pretty much the same as 95% of the political class.

Now I never liked him, but black people, a large majority of them, loved him and still love him.  For a long time he was one of the few black people who could get the mainstream media to listen to him. When there was a racial issue, Jesse would fly in and help shine a light on it, get it some media attention. 

And the racists, of course, hate him for that. Because the story of modern racists is that there is no racism. Anyone who tries to convince you that there is still racism and that racism is a still a problem is a con-artist, a "race hustler" in the parlance of the racist shit heel.

Has he done some bad things in his life? Sure. Pretty much all great men or those who aspire to greatness are serious assholes in one way or another.  But the inchoate rage that he inspires is people is all out of proportion for the things he's done or purported to have done. 

Look at the whole Hymie Town incident. To say he handled that badly would be an understatement, but it was over 30 years ago and people still want to throw that brick at him whenever his name comes up. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No. He has no right to grab her wrist at that point. 

If he really felt that that that drunkenly raised fist with her arm bent fully at the elbow and pointed at her own ear was a threat he could have raised his hand to ward it off or taken a step back. 

Instead he grabs her arm and roughly twists it downward. He had absolutely no right to do that.

She want to break free of his hold, so she raises her right knee and then comes across with a weak left.  At that point, again, the correct action is push off and step back. Instead he pops her hard in the face and then lets go and walks away.  </TEXT>
