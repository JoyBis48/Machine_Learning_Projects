	<TEXT> This was all shot with the camera on auto, it's tough to work out exposure etc using a small phone display outdoors.

Immediate things I noticed: DJI Pilot automatically saves the video to your phone/tablet, which absolutely destroys the battery. My Note 4 died before I got the third battery into the Phantom. The ultrasonic sensor/visual positioning thing screws with your shots if you're trying to fly smoothly, best to turn it off or fly in attitude if you're looking for stable footage.

A fair bit of chromatic aberration in the final image, and it really doesn't like being pointed into the sun. I was happy to discover after my phone ran out that it'll fly without the phone connected, and because there's a record button on the controller, you can still film even if you can't see - the last 5 or 6 clips were done blind.

Oh, and it hates taking off on a slanted surface. Out in the bush I couldn't find a totally flat spot for liftoff, and the little "whoosh whoosh" warmup routine it does when you start the props ended up tipping it over. Grrrrr. Anyway hope that's helpful to somebody! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 10C is a great product - but it's not as good a headset as the 20S, and it's not as good a camera as a GoPro. The headset is similar in quality and usability to the SMH-10, so it's no bad thing, it just doesn't have the huge 2km range and voice controls of the 20S.

If you don't need pro quality vision I think it's an awesome and very convenient piece of kit. Very easy to use. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> He's a wonderful combination of arrogant, I'm-the-best-fear-my-wrath bluster, mixed with a comically mercenary habit of ditching his team to play with other huge talents or recruiting like mad to stack his own team. There's nothing organic or real about the teams he won titles with, and this year he "came home" by gutting the shit out of Cleveland's roster and stacking that to the rafters as well. 

I respect his court vision, his outrageous physical gifts and his ability to make big plays at important times, but I hate his bullying style of driving to the rim and just bashing his way in. There's nothing pretty about the way he finishes to me. 

I love nothing more than watching him get shat on, looking forward to seeing it again, hopefully in an earlier round of the playoffs. Also looking forward to watching Cleveland struggle with massive salary issues in the wake of GM James wanting more talent and more money at the same time.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I spent last week doing my RPA license course... I don't think unlicensed operators are gonna realise just how much controlled airspace there is. Here's a quick look at Melbourne, for example, the first legal bits of sky are out as far as Brighton or Williamstown. Forget about going North, there's a wide controlled zone around Melbourne airport. http://i.imgur.com/jIbQAUG.jpg

People are just going to break the laws that are left, and not get caught. CASA seems insanely understaffed as it is (it's taking them 6 months to put a stamp on an Operator Certificate at the moment) - there's no way they'll be chasing every guy with 2 drone shots in his video that look like they were taken near a building, or within 3 nautical miles from a helipad.

Meanwhile, those of us that slogged through the process will still be obliged to plan, risk assess and log every flight and the charge levels of our batteries, wait our 30 days for area approvals and whatnot. I dunno how rational it's all looking to be honest. </TEXT>

Damnit, I should have hedged with a bet on the cavs too, so that my burning hate and fury if they win would at least be slightly quenched by some guy running around in a cockenballs hat. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That was a pretty shit game by the warriors. I felt they were lucky to take it. Steph never got going and they needed a couple of Iggy threes to stay in the hunt.

Lebron beasted, Thompson made me feel like golden state was lucky to get a defensive board, Smith regressed to the mean and the whole Cavs team dropped their bundle when Kyrie went down.  </TEXT>
