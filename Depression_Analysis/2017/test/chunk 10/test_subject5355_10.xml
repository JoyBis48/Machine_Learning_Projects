Therefore, wouldn't it be better to brush after lunch for maximum efficiency since there is actual food matter in my mouth then?

	<TEXT> It should kill the bacteria that builds up in my mouth overnight, but will not wash away physical matter - which itself is damaging and will attract more bacteria.

I figure, if there is no food stuff in my mouth (as I would have brushed before bed), it seems like a waste of time brushing when I could just mouthwash. I'd rather brush after lunch for maximum efficiency (as I hear brushing more than twice a day is bad, I'd rather 'use up a brushing session' when there is actual food stuff in my mouth). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Batman and Michael Cera face off in the children's luck based boardgame "Candyland". Each player has **two years** prep time to learn the rules of the game and play it with their friends.

The cards are shuffled independently by someone else in another room, and neither contender gets any gadgets or can interact with the board or card in any way beyond their intended use. They play a best of five.

I think the proof seems to be "if it wasn't for that clue, Batman never would have caught the Riddler". But if the Riddler wasn't leaving DELIBERATE clues, Batman might find clues that he he accidentally left. Maybe the crimes are riddled (cough) with clues that Batman doesn't need to find because the Riddler gives away his identity anyway.

Basically, we don't know how good the Riddler is at covering his tracks because we never need to look in the first place; he always leaves obvious fucking shit around. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's literally just preference. There are albums with no cohesive narrative or reason for their ordering that I like to listen to in order (or sometimes not!) and there are albums that do have an intended listening order or even have songs that flow into one another and I don't even own the entire album, because their hits are fine for me.

Listen to the album in whatever way increases your enjoyment. For most albums, I'll listen to it in full or on shuffle quite happily. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I crafted some decent gear and did a lot of sidequests so now I outlevel everything. I still use them for bosses or throw the occasional Tawny Owl out just to speed things up a bit, but most enemies die in a few hits and are easy to dodge regardless of whether I use potions or not. I might get hit once per fight so it's not worth the hassle of opening the menu up and scrolling down to my pots.

I think that's the main problem with this game - there are lots of sidequests, which  is great, but the leveling isn't spread out enough. You just end up outleveling everything by exploring and before you know it you can equip some mean ass sword or armour. </TEXT>

Film critics reviews are tools. If you generally agree with a critic's opinions, then it's a good tool for determining what movies you watch down the track. Or you can read around the opinions to determine if the movie is something you might like based on their summary. Or they may save you from seeing particularly bad movies (most of the stuff at the bottom of RT wouldn't be to your liking, right? So statistically reviews aid you).

No one can see every movie ever made, reviews are useful. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No, but they know about their preferences over a failed product vs a delayed product. The can see the numbers of sales for franchises, gauge consumer interest, and other financial data to determine their preference in this area.

It was also likely the last Arkham game so hurting the brand isn't as important.

Knowing how to actually play the game is irrelevant. Just as they're out of touch with how to put their face in a WiiU, you would probably be completely out of touch with how to make a good return on investment.

They knew what they were doing and it would have worked if not for the unfortunate timing with the refunds system. </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2015-07-15 03:46:24 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I did this a short time ago with [heroes](https://www.reddit.com/r/whowouldwin/comments/3c9t4h/batman_peter_parker_reed_richards_and_tony_stark/) and said I'd consider doing it again with villains (well, antagonists since I included Adrian). So here it is. Some of this will be copy pasted from the other thread, but I made some changes to the rounds:

It's the current US Shark Tank. Each character goes on assuming a secret identity - that of a young entrepreneur in their early 20s. This eliminates the default perception of the character (ie. investors feeling safer investing with Wayne, a billionaire, as opposed to a mere Uni student). However, they keep their current personalities. **Important note: Any item pitched is free from existing patents, etc., so basically ignore issue of ownership for existing items**

* **Round 1)** Each makes a new invention designed to resolve a common household problem. It can be any problem, but must be applicable to a typical home. They have 24 hours to choose a problem and create the solution. Each has $500,000,000 at their disposal for some overnight R D. And what problem do you think each is likely to address?

* **Round 2)** Any invention they have ever made - they MUST have made it personally (eg. Adrian had Manhattan's help). Pick the one you think would have the most success from each character and pit them against eachother.

* **Round 3)** Each must gain funding for a plan to cause mass destruction. Specifically, they must pitch an item, project or service to that Shark Tank crew that can secretly be used for ulterior evil motives. For example, tricking them into funding a new brand of toothpaste that contains mind controlling fluoride. Remember, the investors will be watching the project careful, so you can't simply take the money for one thing and build a nuke with it.

**Remember to take into account marketability**, affordability (even the Shark Tank guys aren't likely to pitch in for a Batmobile), rough manufacturing costs, etc, and the individual personalities of the Shark Tank hosts. I haven't seen much US Shark Tank, but I know in the Australian version you can get an idea of which host is likely to go for which products.

Finally, major problem with the last one: The Shark Tank guys are rarely ready to invest for more than a few hundred thousand. Is getting an Iron Man suit to market at all possible with that amount? </TEXT>
