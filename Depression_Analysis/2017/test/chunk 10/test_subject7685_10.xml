	<TEXT> I like to fly low to the ground and close to buildings, you can't beat the situational awareness of 3rd person IMO. If you're in VTOL mode trying to nail enemies first person doesn't cut it unless they're far away. When in air to air combat I can always get a better view of my opponent looking around with the right stick in 3rd person than I do in 1st person. By definition the 1st person view limits your range of vision compared to 3rd.

At least that's how I see it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ah I get it now. People played UMK3 in the arcades. Living in England (but not in a major city) the only time I ever got play an arcade machine as a kid was when the fair was in town. And even then, we were lucky to get MK1, and at 1 a go (which usually lasted no more than a couple of minutes) we didn't get to play on it all that much.

And so I keep forgetting about later MK games being released in the arcades.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I had it when I was around 13 I think on the PS1. Loved it. Had no one to play it with mind. But I'm pretty sure it had all the characters in the franchise up to that point. Including a playable Noob Saibot (my introduction to him), Rain's first appearance, and even various kostumes for some characters.

With Kano you could play as the MK1 or MK3 versions. Kung Lao MK2 or 3, Raiden (or Rayden back then) as MK1 or MK2 and some others too. The old versions were updated with kombos and shit.

MK Trilogy was to UMK3 what UMK3 was to MK3, simply a better version with more characters. This is why I'm always confused when people express love for UMK3 like it's the best version of the klassic MK games.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> And now dambladge is how I'm going to say that word lol.

I was disappointed to find out that Reptile's slide doesn't go under projectiles. Sub-Zero has always been my main you see, and I'm used to being able to close distance when the enemy uses projectiles.

Just googled Reptil buffs and found this comment:

"Lol, I just checked the notes. He got NERFED if anything. Nerf to his nimble combos due to 4 having lower damage, buff to his absolutely pointless strings that no one uses. The only buff that matters is overhead doing 2 more damage but that doesn't affect him a lot exactly. Wow."

Can you confirm? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They'd probably just put in the story character like Sindel, Baraka, Kabal, and Rain as they seem to be the most requested of the story characters. I can't see them soon smoke since he's a faction kill.

	<TEXT> Or it was just that the zombies mode had very little story until BO2. It was mostly fan speculation that eventually became canon. Zombies was made in a rush as a direct response to horde mode in Gears 2, so they didn't have time to make a story. The game came first, then the story followed.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My only advice is you must get all the challenges done, all of them. You'll fail if you don't. Make sure you know what the challenge is just before the fight loads. If you do all 5(?) in a row you get crazy points. I think I took part in about 7-10 towers before I won one.  </TEXT>
