	<TEXT> So anyway why did you go on to give detailed statements to thirdparty dank memers first, before speaking to us? The place with the tagline 'Hitler did nothing wrong'? The people you slighted in the first place? Hell even 4chins got info before this statement from m'lady...  
  
Edit: /u/kickme444 responded to me, but I anticipate m'lady will be heavily euphoric so here's the reply  
It was hard to communicate my dank memes, because my comments were being downboated. I did comment on (le)reddit lmayyyyo and was tipping my trilby on a private subreddit. I'm euphoric now." </TEXT>

You know, some dogs are just ugly, even without "defects." And what about all the pictures of dogs with underbites that have been posted? Isn't that a birth defect?
