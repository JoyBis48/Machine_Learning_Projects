	<TEXT> I would argue that Palpatine is the main villain of the PT - he's not present as much as Vader is in terms of actively terrorizing our heroes, but he's the one pulling all the strings.

I think each of the TFA villains will mirror an OT one-

Hux - Tarkin
Phasma - Boba Fett
Kylo Ren - Vader
Smoke - The Emporer </TEXT>

Episode 4 villain: Tarkin

Disney happens to be very protective of their properties, and Jurassic World really isn't the same as Star Wars. </TEXT>

Star Wars, BvS, Civil War, X-Men, Suicide Squad, Independence Day, Finding Dory, Warcraft, Star Trek, Ice Age, Ghostbusters, Borne, Gambit, Doctor Strange, Fantastic Beasts, Assassin's Creed, and Star Wars again....

	<TEXT> Affleck one his Oscar for Good Will Hunting, not The Town. 

Mad Max is just as much a risk as Furious 7 is. It's still a sequel, and it's an action movie. That appeals to a lot of people.

And nowadays the standard budget for most major studio films is somewhere around 100 million, and if the studio really didn't have confidence in those projects, they wouldn't have greenlit them. Only a few of those examples flopped, most were financial or critical successes. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Suicide Squad takes place before BvS - Batman is in it, and the Joker is in it. In the latest BvS trailer, we see Robin's suit with presumably the Joker's handwriting on it. I doubt they'd take the time to tell this story in that movie, so it's more likely that they would wait for Suicide Squad - or possibly Affleck's solo Batman movie. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I definitely wouldn't call any of those projects risks particularly.

Nolan and Cuaron are critically acclaimed directors, Affleck is an Oscar winner, and the Wachowskis have made many successful projects in the past. 

Those are not risks. Most of those projects payed off, and it wasn't expected that they wouldn't.

It would be risky to throw 200 million dollars at a director who's only directed 1 feature film - and Universal are the ones that did that  with Jurassic World, not WB. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> First of all, Plinkett elaborated as to why that shot didn't work in comparison to the opening shot of A New Hope.

Second, there's no way Roger Ebert gave TPM 4 and 1/2 stars because his rating only goes up to 4 - it was 3 and 1/2 stars.

And third - there was tons of effort put into the prequels by the actors and most of the crew, but George Lucas is not a good director. Watch the interview Ewan McGregor did on The Graham Norton show the other week, where he tells a story about how Lucas has a lot of trouble directing characters. He puts visuals above story a lot of the time, which leads to a bad movie.

I could very easily go out and make a crummy movie, and say that it's a homage to bad movies like Howard the Duck and Jaws 4, but that doesn't justify it being bad. </TEXT>
