	<TEXT> Try to think of your diagnosis like diabetes. :) I find it easier to brush of peoples ignorance that way, because I wouldn't feel ashamed or upset if someone tried to make me feel bad for having a broken leg or something, just laugh at them for being an idiot. At the end of the day, your brain is an organ and can get unwell just like any other.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you for that. I think the hardest thing has been, after having the diagnosis explained to me and what the symptoms are, I had this epiphany-type moment where I went back through all the shit that has gone on in my life and, with the revelation of this disorder, realizing that every single episode was caused by me and me alone. My entire understanding of my past and my friendships has been completely flipped, and it makes me sick to think of the things I have done to people because I thought they deserved it, how I pushed people away and yet expected them to come back and save me. I'm so deathly afraid of the road ahead. Its bittersweet in a sense because for once in my entire life I have an understanding of the chaos that is inside me, but at the moment I can't see it changing or getting better (even though, logically, I know it can).  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> I just got diagnosed with BPD and I am reeling </TITLE>

	<TEXT> I'm a 20 y/o guy that has struggled with episodes of rage and depression my entire life. I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder in 2011 and have been treated on the basis of that up until today. A few days ago I had my first major depressive/suicidal episode in almost two years and was admitted into a psych hospital after much convincing by my doctor (I could feel myself sliding into a depression so I decided to see my doctor to get a referral to a psychiatrist). After speaking with some of the doctors here they are confident that I have BPD. I never even knew what it was. After reading up on the symptoms, every single thing is applicable to me. Intense mood swings, splitting, issues in my friendships and relationships, impulsive behaviour, self destructiveness and suicidal thoughts etc etc.

I've been reading up on BPD and I feel so so much worse. I always knew there was something really wrong with me, and I thought it was Bipolar - I WISH it was bipolar because at least it is treatable. It feels like a death sentence. I cannot see myself ever finding love or holding down a meaningful friendship (my life is a long, smoking trail of destroyed and failed attempts to connect with people). I feel lost and upset and confused. I don't want this. Where do I go from here. FUCK </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The issue is that she is practically living here and not paying rent. I do like her as a person, I consider her a friend, which is why the situation is so difficult/complicated because I want to resolve this without damaging the friendship. I probably should have mentioned this before but she was actually living here before I moved in. She was living here with Roommate B until they split up, and I took over her lease. They got back together after a few weeks which is when this all started. Putting her on the lease is not an option because of a few things: 

- the apartment is simply not big enough for four people (its a two bedroom apartment, and the room that I'm in isn't really a room)

- there is only three car spaces, with no other place to park within 3km (she currently parks in the visitor spot when she comes over, which residents aren't allowed to do)

- the landlord would not allow her back on the lease anyway, because she handled leaving so poorly last time (she basically just up and left and stopped paying rent - it was just luck that I happened to be moving around the same time because I was looking at other places before Roommate A asked me to take over the lease)

Having said all that though, myself and roommate A have discussed asking her to pay a share of the utilities bill when it comes next, based on her being here literally every weekend and having showers etc.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Me [20m] and my roommate [22m] - I'm on the edge of insanity (LONG) </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> **TL;DR: My roommate has no respect for myself or the apartment, does not make any effort to keep the place clean or contribute to the household in any way. His girlfriend (who does not live with us) is at the apartment basically 24/7 and does not respect the boundaries of myself or my other roommate. There is constant drama in the household, and despite my best efforts to tame the situation, nothing is changing   it is affecting my work performance and getting me down. I don't know where to go from here.**

I moved in with roommate A   roommate B in February earlier this year. Roommate A is great - I have been friends with him for over 10 years, and we rarely have issues between us when it comes to household stuff. Roommate B (who I had only briefly met once before I moved in) on the other hand is an absolute fucking nightmare.

So there are a lot of issues at play here; Roommate B

- Never cleans up/washes his dirty dishes

- Never contributes to shared items for the household (toilet paper, cleaning products, milk etc.)

- Refuses to do stuff like take out the rubbish

- Has a total disregard for the noise he makes when other people are sleeping (Roommate A   myself both do shift work and generally work weekends while Roommate B has a day job and weekends off, so he's always having people over for drinks   coming home late over the weekend and just being as loud as fucking possible)

These are some of the more minor grievances, which are sort of a non-issue because of one thing - his girlfriend. His girlfriend will come over and do his washing, cleaning, cooking, and buy his share of the household shared items (they have a joint bank account). But that is also sort of the problem here.

Roommate B's girlfriend is over every single day of the week - from the afternoon when Roommate B finishes work (~4pm) until late into the evening (10-11pm). As I said above, she'll come over   cook for him, clean up all his mess, do his washing and pack his lunch for work the next day. The only reason she goes home is because myself and Roommate A sat down with them and told them that she could no longer sleep in the apartment during the week (after she had slept there for 15 consecutive days). So now it just feels like they're taking the piss. She is here as often as possible during the week without actually sleeping over, so technically following the agreement we had made with them, and then she is here from Friday afternoon until late Sunday evening (and will stay on a Monday if there is a public holiday because 'its apart of the weekend'). 

This has been a constant issue in the household, and myself and Roommate A are constantly having to address it. The issue isn't really so much even the time she spends here, its the way she treats the apartment   the fact that she comes here not as a guest, but to basically live in the apartment (without paying rent or utilities). Further issues with Roommate B's girlfriend;

- She does her washing here (not all of it, but regularly enough to be noticed)

- She has her own bath towel   hook in the bathroom

- She frequently refers to the apartment as 'home' or 'our place'

- She will invite her friends to the apartment without letting any of us know (has brought them over for dinner)

And just yesterday she walked through our front door unannounced, with a friend, while Roommate B was not home (he had given her his key to get in).

So all this stuff is going on on a regular basis, just constantly building up my frustration at the situation and both Roommate B   his girlfriend's total lack of respect for myself and Roommate A, and then on TOP of this, every single weekend (or close enough to not make a difference) they will go out for a drink, come home and have these loud, melodramatic arguments that go on for MINIMUM two hours. This is not just bickering, its huge episodes where she's screaming and crying and threatening to leave him forever. If he hasn't cheated on her, he's spent too much of her money or he's taken drugs again. This is of course followed by them making up and having ridiculously loud sex. I haven't been living here all that long but I have already lost count of the amount of times I have had to go into work with NO sleep because of this shit. 

This honestly sounds like an episode of some stupid TV show and I legitimately feel like I'm trapped in the big brother house. I have voiced my concerns numerous times to the both of them on all of the above issues, and they say all the right stuff and it gets better for about a week, and then quickly descends right back into where it was.

I just want to be able to feel comfortable and safe in my own apartment. I want to be able to sleep   have my roommate respect my space and the apartment. I am on the lease until January and I am at a complete loss of what to do here. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Last Friday night I met up with a friend and a couple of her friends that I had not seen for a few months - after a few drinks we ended up getting our hands on some ecstasy and took a few pills each. These were the strongest ones I'd ever done and I ended up on a completely new level - it was fun and awesome, we basically just hung out at a bar until they closed at 7am. By the time we got outside I had started to come down, and after getting a bite to eat I started having mild hallucinations (likely due to sleep deprivation) and decided to go home. Up until this point the night had gone fantastically, but my friend and the other guy we were with instantly turned nasty as they wanted to keep going (there is a club where I live that is open 24 hours Fri-Mon and is generally filled with people that don't want the good times to end). They started taking advantage of the fact that I was coming down (both physically and mentally) and were trying to scare/guilt me into staying. I have only just moved to town so I didn't really know where we were, and they refused to give me directions to the nearest train station and even actively tried to make me confused/lost - I tried to get my bearings by walking the direction I thought we had come and they followed me, laughed at me and told me I was going the wrong direction. I was becoming extremely upset and just wanted them to leave me alone but kept my cool and did not give them the reaction they wanted - just pretended like that weren't doing it and gave them both hugs and thanked them for a good night when I finally got on a tram home (thanks to my phone).

Why do people do this? I have no issue with going on multiple-day benders but when someone decides they're done, why on earth would you try to make them feel like shit for making that decision? Because I was coming down extremely hard it really rattled me and I ended up in tears on the tram. It has truly affected the way I view this person (after being decent friends with them for 3 years) and I probably won't socialize with her ever again. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes, you can do this by shrinking the existing partition to whatever you desire (the minimum being the amount of data currently on it, so 400gb) using Partition Wizard in windows or gparted (from a live linux disc). You can then create an additional partition to install OS X to. 

Just FYI, it's recommended for beginners to install OS X on two separate hard drives as installing them on the same harddrive can cause issues that may be difficult to solve for someone that has never hackintoshed before. The OS X installer will refuse to install on a drive that does not have a GPT partition table (windows machines typically have MBR) and you will need to patch your installer to allow you to do so. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When I was suicidal I used to write letters to the few people I thought I owed an explanation to if I were to actually commit suicide. By the time I finished each letter, the feeling would pass and I would promise myself that I would sleep on it and if I still felt like doing it tomorrow, I would. Each time I would wake up the next day feeling really silly and dumb and continue on. I kept each letter that I wrote in a book. I wrote about 10 in all, and then a day came where I realised there was nobody else I felt I should write a letter to - which means I no longer had something to distract me from the suicidal compulsions I had. I left the letters on my bed and stood outside my parents bedroom door for about an hour, hoping that they would somehow be able to sense that I desperately needed help. They didn't, so I got in my car and drove to a stretch of road that I often travelled to clear my head, which I had never seen any other cars on at night. I closed my eyes and just put my foot down and let go of the wheel, ended up going off the road and rolling a couple of times before crashing into a tree.

What went through my mind? Nothing. Not to take away from what other commenters have posted here, but I have noticed a lot of people are posting about having a rough night and thinking about suicide. When you really make the decision to end your life, you don't think about anything. You have considered every single option and to your (irrational) brain, suicide isn't just the best option, it is the *only* option. An overwhelming sense of calm and clarity overtook me. My mind was blank. 

I walked away from that car with a couple of stitches in my head and back (crawling through the shattered windshield) and a broken finger. To say I was incredibly lucky was an understatement. 

Depression is no joke. If you think someone you know might be struggling, PLEASE do something. The thing that made it the most difficult for me is that I had reached out to people and nobody really took me seriously. My parents wrote off my behaviour changes and general deterioration of my mental state to being a teenager. Please, don't ignore shit like this. Suicide is a fucking horrible thing.  </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2014-09-05 07:19:20 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm having issues getting my Wifi USB adapter to work. I previously installed Mavericks on my PC via Niresh 10.9 and after seeing how well it worked I decided to create a clean install USB and reinstall OSX (Niresh comes with a lot of extra kexts and random apps and I wouldn't really feel comfortable doing anything that requires me to put in a password on it).

The USB adapter I have uses a 8191s Realtek chipset, and on the Niresh installation all I had to do with download the Mac drivers from Realtek's website (used the ML drivers as they were the latest one). No issues there, all up and running perfectly.

Now, with the clean install, after installing the drivers and wireless utility app that comes with them (using the exact same install package that previously worked on 10.9) and then restarting (as per the installation instructions), the Wireless Utility app refuses to start. I open the app and I can see the icon appear briefly in the dock before immediately disappearing again.

Things that I have tried:

* Installing different/older versions of the driver (tried every driver available from realtek)

* Tried modified drivers from macbreaker forums

* Manually installing the kexts that are contained in the installer.pkg

All with multiple reboots - no dice. Still the same issue.

One thing that does stick out to me, on the Niresh install, when viewing USB devices in System Report, it listed the USB as RTL8181S Wi-Fi Adaptor, whereas with the clean 10.9.4 install it is simply listed as Miscellaneous USB device - which makes me think its an issue with a missing or unmodified kext that had already come with Niresh and I have yet to install; only thing is, I have no clue how to figure out what I'm missing. Is it a motherboard issue?

Any pointers would be great! </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Hi /r/melbourne! I'm moving to Melbourne in January and could use some advice </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-08-18 09:14:40 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hello Melbourne-dwelling redditors! I have plans to move to Melbourne (from the Gold Coast) in January and wanted to get some advice on a few things:

1. **Housing**: Firstly, I need somewhere to stay. I intend for the move to be permanent, so I am looking for something long term, and was leaning towards a house share with a couple of other roommates (so I don't get lonely). My question is this: I would really love to have living arrangements sorted before I head down there, but a lot of people I have spoken to have advised against making a commitment to a place that I haven't seen in person, as people will often post misleading photos on the internet and places are generally a lot less favourable when you actually get there. I'm also a bit worried about getting scammed and sending a bond payment to a person for a house that doesn't even exist. How prevalent are these scammers in Melbourne? Is this something I should be looking out for? How realistic is it of me to expect to have living arrangements made before I go down there? Would I be better off staying in a hotel for a few weeks while I inspect houses? Would people be willing to agree to let me rent from them without even having met me first? I thought having a Skype call might mediate some of these issues - myself and the ad poster would get a feel for each other and then they could give me a sort of 'virtual tour' around the home. Also, how early should I start inquiring for accommodation? I have noticed a lot of the Gumtree ads are looking for people to move in ASAP, so I don't think they'd be willing to wait for me to come down in January - but I really don't want to be leaving it to the last minute.

2. **Work**: As well as living arrangements, I would also like to have a job strapped down for when I get there. Many of the same questions apply here; how likely would it be for an employer to hire me based on a phone/Skype interview? I would like to start working immediately when I get down there. I have approx. 1.5 years worth of hospitality experience, the last 4-5 months of that being in a senior supervisor role - how marketable is this experience? Are there a lot of hospitality jobs going down in Melbourne?

3. **Transport**: This I'm not too worried about, but thought I'd mention it just in case I'm being a little naive. I've been to Melbourne about 5 times in the last 2 years, so I have a fairly decent feel of the inner city suburbs and how the public transport works. However, I will be without a license until mid February, and without a car until I can afford one. How survivable is Melbourne without a car? Will I be able to rely entirely on public transport (I would like to avoid taxis at all costs, those things are killer expensive)? I have no family or friends down there, so I have nothing to fall back on (other than taxis...) if I get stuck somewhere there isn't public transport. I intend on buying a bicycle as soon as I get down there as well, and I am used to riding around to get myself from A to B. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When someone is having an anxiety attack its important to 'ground' them. Usually resting a hand on an arm or a shoulder and speaking to them calmly will be the most you can do. Generally the person suffering the anxiety attack just has to let it pass. Just let them know you're there. If you realize they're having a panic attack, tell them. "You're having a panic attack. You are not dying. It will pass soon. Try to steady your breathing." in the calmest voice possible. </TEXT>

I get that it can take a significant amount of time to create a gif, especially high quality ones (I've just started doing it myself so I can appreciate the effort that goes into them), but unless the reposter is making real world $$$ from it, I don't see the issue. </TEXT>
