	<TITLE> The Moment Before Death </TITLE>

	<TEXT> The moment before death is one of the most terrifying parts of dying. I know this experience first hand. Let me first start off by explaining a few things. I was 16. About to make the biggest mistake of my life. Not Sex. Not Drinking and driving, some thing else. We lived in a very bad neighborhood, the kind your parents warn you about, in a very conservative area, so being openly gay was a huge challenge. Dealing with verbal abuse got through to me very quickly, and within a year, I was diagnosed with depression. It soon turned dark and I decided to commit suicide. I hung the rope, and slipped in. It tugged and tugged. When I lost consciousness, everything went black. I knew I was about to die. I was suddenly faced with extreme regret, anxiety, sadness, happiness, and most of all, fear. Out of the darkness, walked a figure. I was suddenly able to walk around. The figure was an average sized man with a dark grey beard. He asked me if I was ready to go. "Where?" I asked him. "I do not know" he said. 
Just then a hand reached out of the darkness and grabbed my arm. Next thing I know, I woke up in ICU.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Block update detectors are pretty useful. Its some glitch with the game engine that was discovered a long time ago and was never patched due to its usefulness. its called a block update detector, or BUD switch for short. Its used to detect changes in a block such as stepping on a redstone ore, or opening/closing a door. Its very hard to understand exactly whats going on in the game engine, i just know how it works.  </TEXT>
