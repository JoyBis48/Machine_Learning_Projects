	<TITLE> Looking for recommendations for an Irish 'experience' I can gift to my honeymooning brother </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-06-10 03:28:34 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> My brother is getting married in a couple months and he and his fiancee are honeymooning in Ireland.

They have asked for wedding presents to be monetary contributions to their trip.

I'd like to keep to their wishes, but in a way that will make my gift be more memorable and meaningful than an amount of money going into a pool. I'm looking for museum tickets or special excursion passes that I can pre-purchase for them and give to them at the wedding. 

Please share recommendations! Thank you! 

Also I have been informed they intend to stick to the southwestern parts of the country to see greenspace and castles. </TEXT>

Thanks!

	<TEXT> I mainly research Civil War POWs, and there were a few anecdotes in this podcast that stuck with me.

1. German POWs in Aliceville had so much food they buried the extra to get rid of it

2. American officials treated the German POWs so well because they feared retaliatory treatment of American POWs (but then continued after they discovered how American POWs were really treated).

It's amazing how 80 years, a World War, and an important treaty changed ideas towards POWs in this country. For those interested in reading a modern historical perspective on POWs in the American Civil War, I recommend [While in the Hands of The Enemy](http://www.amazon.com/While-Hands-Enemy-Conflicting-Dimensions/dp/0807130613). It's very critical of both sides and their treatment of POWs.  </TEXT>
