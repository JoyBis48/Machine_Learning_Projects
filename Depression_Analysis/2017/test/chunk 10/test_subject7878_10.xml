I, on the other hand, when in the same place will include cleaning up my crap before I veg out and watch television.

She has friends.  She definitely has a supportive husband.  She might be depressed due to me not being around a lot.  Work has gotten crazy lately. </TEXT>

The teenager doesn't give a crap about money surprisingly.  If she doesn't have it, she has an "oh, well" attitude about it.  Totally annoying. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> $300/month for food is low unless you love eating ramen or beans and rice.

Typically, housing should be 25% of your budget.  Right now, your rent estimate is 34%.  It's manageable if you make a budget per month and stick with it.

Okay, not sure where you are (and what the standard cost of living is), but in Baton Rouge, LA (where I live) your situation is totally doable. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes.  I've even said, "Y'all have GOT to help me clean.  I'm not doing it all by myself."

That gets them to help some.  But I end up doing 60-70% of it on my own... and I'm one of five people in the house. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I make passive-aggressive/guilt-trip statements like, "Man, y'all are messy," "Hey, it'd be awesome if you cleaned," etc.

I even asked my wife this evening (after taking kids home to the dirty house and going back to work for the second part of my day) what she did all day.  "I dunno--hung out.  Why?"  I replied, "I dunno... just thought you'd clean up some or something..."  I got no reply. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My wife of 5.5 years and I have a 15yo (step-daughter), 4yo son, and 3yo daughter. I work long hours on weekdays: in by 7:30AM, home by 9:00PM or later. I come home, and there is crap everywhere. It builds and builds until the weekend comes.

I can't relax in a messy house. Dishes (sometimes still with food) in sink, trash all over counters, toys everywhere, etc. I end up cleaning on the weekends because I can't stand it. I make the kids clean their crap (whining about how much it is), ask my wife to help (as she's playing Candy-effing-Crush or Face-effing-book) clean.

Why can't they just clean up their own crap? I spend time cleaning up a house that had literally NO messes made by me. I tried the don't-do-anything-until-they-do-it-themselves trick. That backfired miserably. I had TWO weeks of crap to do.

Case in point: my wife stayed home today with the 15yo who is recovering from a tonsillectomy. I brought the 3yo and 4yo to a sitter. I had hoped she would've cleaned the house, done laundry, done frickin' SOMEthing. NOPE. It eas even MORE messy than when I left this morning. What the hell can I do?

tl;dr - Wife and kids are lazy as hell; they won't clean up; husband/dad does everything after working 14+ work days all week. </TEXT>
