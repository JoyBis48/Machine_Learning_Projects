	<TEXT> But none of the technicalities you listed stophim from being like batman. He still had a sidekick, is still a detective, (literally the first issue of his new series is about detective work) still uses gadgets, still uses batarangs, still had a batmobile and batcopter, still fights crime in a costume that looks like batmans, still glides around like batman, (and one of the most iconic elements of batmans character is that he glides around) has an insignia costume etc. The stuff about Khonshu is debatable, too, as it's constantly questioned whether Khonshu exists. For a reader that hasn't heard of him, the closest approximation to Moon Knight that they'll have heard of is undoubtedly Batman. Same goes for a lot of other peak humans in the Marvel universe, Like Daredevil and Black Panther, even though they have far fewer similarities to batman than Moon Knight. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Just weigh the negatives up against the positives, and your personal sentiment towards the film. You don't need to have a 'list' to go through, as it's not like you're gonna crack some mathematical formula that makes everyone agree with you. The reason a five star system is used a lot is because it's deliberately vague, and means that the majority of the time you don't have to judge one movie you really liked as objectively better than another movie you really liked.


My advice is to read a lot of criticism to see how they do it. Look at den of geek, or Roger Ebert.com or Total Film, or listen to Mark Kermode and see how they appraise things. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Animation is usually conceptualized at the storyboard stage, which is where the majority of the camera movements will be visualized for the artists to work on. The director an cinematographer should be on hand at every stage of animation (3D animations in particular goes through 4-5 different 'builds' of the film) to make sure this vision gets translated to the final product. Interestingly, Mad max: Fury road was also essentially made from a 'script' of 2700 storyboards. Claymation will either us a mix of these techniques or be shot traditionally, just on a smaller scale </TEXT>
