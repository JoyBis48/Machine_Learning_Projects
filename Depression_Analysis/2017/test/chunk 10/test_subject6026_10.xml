	<TEXT> Stumbled across this thanks to someone on twitter. Looks like some black magic shit. Honestly has no idea. I recently found a youtube channel related to a name that's tied to the website. Their only video can be found [here(WARNING LOUD SOUNDS)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SM90-L2g0tc). Its quite disturbing honestly. I also searched the website to find that same image. It was titled "Help me". In the archive of the website there seems to be a video capture that was deleted. I havent found a way to access it. </TEXT>
