	<TITLE> with Puss in Boots 2 in 2018, I think Dreamworks should do spin-off/prequels involving Shrek and Donkey </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-07-22 13:21:43 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> What I mean is a prequel focusing on Shrek's life before Shrek 1 and a prequel on Donkey's life before Shrek 1 etc. If Puss in Boots was successful, then these could do just as well in my opinion. I especially would pay to see a Donkey movie!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I had no "hopes" for this film. I just saw it was critically praised and me and my friend watched it for something fun to do (+ i wanted to see what all the fuss was about). And imo it was disappointing. 

and sorry "they're supposed to be dumb" thats just idiotic to me.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> watched It Follows for the first time last night - most overrated movie of 2015 so far imo </TITLE>

	<TEXT> 1. I thought the soundtrack was cool but very misused. WHY they played it during the silent driving scenes where there's no tension or fear building up i will never know.
2. The main girl was such a dumb character. On the beach, she should have been constantly looking around for "it" rather than just look out to sea, then she gets hit by it. So dumb!
3. There was no tension.
4. It wasnt scary. 
5. The ending was dogshit. 

anyway, thats just my opinion. (let the hate begin) </TEXT>
