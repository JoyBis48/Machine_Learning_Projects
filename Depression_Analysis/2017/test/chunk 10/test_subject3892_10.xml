	<TEXT> Samesies. Although while reading a few of the side stories you can tell which ones were left on the cutting room floor. I liked them, but if I were an editor I can see why you'd cut those if you were forced to chop down some pages. They didn't really contribute to the overall story, but they were fun in their own, dark way.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The imagery at the end was just inciredble. All the dancing and the scene with the bear and just complete and utter chaos. For the judge, it was very much a God-like moment for him. It was his world and you were lucky to be alive in it. He knew it, felt totally in control, and was comfortable enough to dance like a maniac in light of all these revelations. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks for the feedback. This was actually my very first book by him. I do have "All the Pretty Horses" and "The Crossing" as well, all of which were fantastic finds at a recent library sale. 

I rarely ever read two books in a row from the same author and I may need a little palette cleanser after this one, but I can definitely see myself tackling one of those in the not-so-distant future.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey, even Babe Ruth set the original home run record on a healthy diet of hot dogs and beer. Sometimes it just works.

Of course, slugging lumber and jogging around the bases is completely different than hockey, but I digress. 

The point is, there is something magical about hot dogs. For me, excessive gas and a trip to the vomitorium. For Gretzky and Ruth, success in different forms.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Just finished this tonight. At times it was a bit verbose, other times beautifully on point, and finally it ended with what can only be described as Heart of Darkness meets the Wild West.

I loved it. Having spoken to a number of people about this one I've discovered that everyone interprets the ending differently. And to that point, even McCarthy won't go so far as to say exactly what happened.

If you've read it I'd love to hear your two cents.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They're often times fairly uneventful. If anything most of the controversy comes in seeing who teams don't protect from the expansion list or where the definitive "journeyman" lands. Then when he gets drafted by an expansion team devout fans go nuts until they watch him phase out on a struggling team. 

Just look at the 2000 Draft. Jim Dowd, Joey Juneau, Lyle Odelein. All guys who did their time, and then some.

And that's coming from someone who has never been to the city.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't think we have to question Donaire's abilities. I think we have to question his heart. If his heart is in it, if he's committed to the sport and to fitness, he's a top contender against any of those guys. What we've seen in recent fights is that he's just not into it like he was two or three years ago.  </TEXT>

Outside of that he seems to be a man of few words, but likely because English isn't his first language.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A different time, different technology and a different sport, but something like that almost happened in the 60s to the (then) Minnesota Lakers.

http://nypost.com/2009/02/08/1960-lakers-will-never-forget-plane-crash-that-changed-their-lives/

The NBA did a really great in-depth piece on it on the 50th anniversary a few years back. 

http://www.nba.com/2010/news/features/steve_aschburner/01/15/lakers.anniversary/index.html

We've seen it happen in the KHL to Lokomotiv and even at the college level with Marshall, but hopefully we never have to see it again, regardless of sport or division. Scary stuff.  </TEXT>
