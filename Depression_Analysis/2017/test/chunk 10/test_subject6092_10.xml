	<TEXT> Play against  the computer. Start at whatever difficulty you want. If you're comfortable that's good. If it gets to the point where you aren't losing and are easily winning, go up a difficulty. If you just getting into soccer watching more and more of it can help you play fifa.
 I have a friend, he started playing it on fifa 13 and I would beat him 7-0, he now beats me most of the time, although he plays much more than I do.
Watching youtubers can help too. It may sound ridiculous or nerdy, but studying how others play can make you better.
Here are my tips: 
1. Be patient with the ball.
2. Be patient, but not too patient on defense.
3. Get comfortable with a few skill moves. 
4. Learn what's OP in the game, abuse it and learn how to stop it. 
5. Develop a style of play you're comfortable with. 
6. Be deadly with set pieces. (Free kicks have been OP for years now, and corners can get easy.)
7. Know the players you're using. (This might be the most important aspect. You don't want to try long shots with a guy who's long shot is 62. You don't want to head a ball in with a guy who has 50 heading accuracy. You should know weak and strong foot as well as skill moves for the players.)

	<TEXT> Gervinho-Doumbia-Ibarbo for a cheap front 3. Although Cuadrado is solid too if you prefer him to Ibarbo.

But really, I've loved the NIF Griezmann. He's great, I have him in a team with NIF Pogba and Benzema linked up with him and Griezmann has been brilliant. I also use him as a super sub in my other squads. 

Reus is simply amazing and fairly cheap. 

I like NIF Bolasie is you know skill moves fairly well.

Enner Valencia is an amazing striker, and he is almost always in perfect position. He's poached plenty of goals for me. He's not rated highly and he's cheap. 2 star skills though, but unless you're a skiller that shouldn't matter. 

Wayne Rooney if you love long shots and strong strikers.

I've got a team with Doumbia and Teves, I think they compliment each other really well and Teves is a beast - very similar to Rooney I think. 

A brilliant CM for La Liga is Perez, I forget what team he is on. Great attributes across the card. 

I think the best CDM in the game is Khedira. Obviously he's slow, but he's been rock solid for me all year. 

For fullbacks, I've liked Evra, Luke Shaw, Kyle Walker the most. David Alaba is or was over 10k and I found him underwhelming. 

For center backs I like Benatia the most, although his high attacking work rate can be kind of annoying. I really like Rojo too.

My favorite goalkeeper in the game has been De Gea. No keeper has impressed me as much as he has or has saved me as many times. 

Also, Lewandowski has been one of my favorite strikers to play up front. Great long shots, positioning, solid speed and he's strong. 

Edit: Chicarito has been very fun to use as well.

	<TEXT> So I consider myself a solid fifa player. I'm d2 in seasons and d4 in ultimate team, but the one thing I struggle with the most is when players can just sprint right by my defense. I can't seem to stop that. I've tried being more patient on defense and playing less pressure but I can't get it to work. Any tips are appreciated! Thank you </TEXT>
