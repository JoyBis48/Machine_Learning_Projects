	<TEXT> A while ago friend of mine got scammed out of his unusual and I managed to get the scammer marked on pretty much every trade site, my friend got some compensation from a couple guys who heard about it. He showed me the items he got back and it added up to around $85, considering that he got scammed out of a $50 unusual he was pretty happy.  
  
Those items now reside in my backpack because I bought his backpack but they live on through me I guess. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Scouts are very annoying, but you need to remember that they tend to earn the kills they get by shooting you and then talking whatever shit they want, they did outskill you to get the kill, maybe they got lucky but when you compare that to a Spy with 300 ping running around going "trickstabed noob" after a facestab a Scout seems like a blessing. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I know, that's why it looks bad, but just saying it's bad and therefore ugly is like saying "I enjoyed this movie" is the same as "10/10". There's no reasoning behind why you enjoyed and rated the movie so highly.  
  
I could have just said 'It looks bad and is ugly" but that's not explaining *why* it looks bad.  
  
Ugliness isn't just looking bad, it's *living* bad.   
[My friend Spongebob said it best.] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N0yXGVWS1Y)  
  
If something wants to be bad it needs to be open for criticism, just look at that movie Quarantine, it's an awful version of something good, just like the Bazooka vs The Stocket Launcher, I'm not going to go any deeper into this but basically America took the movie [REC] and made it ugly, an American took the Stock RL and made it ugly.  
  
The [duct tape] (http://i.imgur.com/boQuHqI.png) is still awful so I'm glad it gets held behind me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The Beggar's Bazooka not only looks like shit but takes a shit on players. This horrendous pile of trash has dropped too many ubers while looking worse than ramen noodles thrown onto bread with butter. (But for real noodles in bread is SO good but looks awful.)  
  
[Look at this thing.] (http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/777183914644516158/36652D6B073BF227551DFA753D64AE7262DDF5EB/) What is the appeal for the design? "Yo guys have you ever wanted to take the normal rocket launcher, and throw garbage all over it!? Well for only $2.49 USD this can be all yours!"   
  
Let me break down this item for you.  
Starting at the back we have [this] (http://i.imgur.com/LJQLuer.png), it's the missing piece of the [Stainless Pot!] (http://tf2wiki.net/ww/images/thumb/b/ba/Soldiertinpan.png/200px-Soldiertinpan.png)   
And then that Pot Lid is DUCT TAPED ONTO THE ROCKET LAUNCHER.  
  
Now we can move past the only thing keeping it on, without the duct tape I'm sure it would fall apart. Wait no don't worry guys, [there's a belt.] (http://i.imgur.com/nwCW9BS.png) Just in case your pants fell off mid fight.  
  
I can only assume that [this is for aiming] (http://i.imgur.com/TWEV0cY.png) good luck putting this into use when it spreads like butter on ramen noodle bread (Really guys, try it, it's great.)  
  
[What's this for?] (http://i.imgur.com/otT3vlf.png)  
  
[This handle] (http://i.imgur.com/Q4MVHx3.png) is held on by [cable ties] (http://www.samuelgrant.co.uk/productsbig/135.jpg)  
  
You didn't think that the Stainless Pot was the only hat here did you? This isn't just any [handle] (http://i.imgur.com/ac39anE.png), this is the [Handyman's Handle!] (http://wiki.teamfortress.com/w/images/thumb/a/a4/Handyman's_Handle.png/250px-Handyman's_Handle.png?t=20111210080558)  
  
[Why is this here? Incase the rockets get jammed?] (http://i.imgur.com/W0wooyy.png)  
  
[No idea what this is but it's dumb] (http://i.imgur.com/vNJy0p7.png)  
  
So in summation, it looks bad. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> What item has been crafted the most times? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Title. Every item that can be crafted (To my knowledge at least) gets a craft number, only 100 of them can be seen ingame, but like [these canteens] (http://i.imgur.com/atD8a3y.png) they have a number visible on backpack.tf, so that got me thinking, what item has the highest crafted number?  
  
I'm sure that metal would be the highest if it had a number, but come on now, let's not be bitches about this, let's talk about cooler items.  
  
Personally I think that the item most people need to craft at a point is the MvM Upgrade Canteen.  
  
What are your thoughts? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This one time I ended up doing something that made me feel dumber than dirt.  
  
I was playing some Team Fortress 2 in a public game and somebody was sitting in the spawn not moving.  
I think nothing of it and go out to fight the good fight.  
After about 10 minutes of playing I hear a voice say "Mmph, shorwy I waws ghetting foowd."  
Clearly the guy had food in his mouth and didn't know to chew with his mouth closed.  
From what I can tell he was probably autistic or something because he talked in all the Heavy's lines.  
I play Medic alot so I ended up healing him.  
He always called me "DOCTOR" because that's what I was for him, I was his Doctor.  
In TF2 there's a mechanic called "Ubercharge" which you can google to learn about, not gonna explain it for you.  
The kid yells "DOCTOR, CHARGE ME WHEN BABY TEAM IS NEARBY! HIT IT DOCTOR, CHARGE ME!"  
I pop the uber and he wipes out the whole enemy team.  
He adds me and I accept.  
Every time we play together I go Medic and he goes Heavy.  
He always yells Heavy's battle cry or laughs like him all the time.  
Always thanks me, "YOU ARE GREAT DOCTOR!"  
I think he was poor because he never played any games other than TF2.  
Whenever I asked him about it he said "Doctor, money is needed, must collect money, but money is hard now."  
He sounded so sad so I asked him if he ever saw [Meet the Medic] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36lSzUMBJnc) to brighten up the mood.  
When he said no I gave him a link to the video.  
He was very ecstatic and eagerly asking about the part where the Medic put the uber part into the heart.  
He asked if it was possible to get a new heart with uber.  
I said heart transplants are possible, but without uber.  
He got sad again.  
"Maybe in the future."  
He then gave a Heavy laugh and said "THEN DOCTOR, HEAVY WILL WAIT FOR FUTURE."  
  
A few weeks pass.  
  
He messaged me saying "DOCTOR, Heavy will not be fighting until later in the night."  
It wasn't until tomorrow until he got on.  
For the record he called himself Heavy because that's the only class he ever played and it was his Steam name.  
  
I got a message saying "DOCTOR, Heavy doesn't feel well. I go to other doctors but they were nowhere near as good as you, DOCTOR."  
He sent this message when I was already asleep, I have no fucking idea where he lives.  
Last message said "DOCTOR, Heavy will go now. But do not fear baby men on other team. You are good doctor. With you, victory is always good. Heavy will join in future.  
By the time I got the message he was already offline.  
He never came back on in a year.  
One day he came back on, I messaged him and asked why he'd been away the whole time.  
It was his mom.  
"David, (Heavy), died of heart failure, I'm sorry. Are you the doctor he was always talking about? You're the only friend on his friends list. He was always going on about how him and the Doctor were best friends and how you always lead the team to victory. I don't know what he was talking about, but I was happy that he was happy. We're selling this computer because we never had much money to begin with, if we did he would be here right now."  
I sat there and looked at the screen for a good 5 minutes before another message popped up.  
"Before I sell this computer, I have one question I need to ask."  
I replied with "Please go ahead."  
"I need something."  
"What is it?"  
"I need about tree fiddy."  
  
Now it was around this time that I realized Heavy was 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleozoic era. Goddamnit! That Loch Ness Monster had gotten me again! "I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy you god damn loch ness monstah!"  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The saddest thing I've ever seen was when my son stole my money and basically changed my whole perspective of him. Reader beware, you're in for a tear.  
  
It wasn't too long ago. I was doing some work around the house, and he came and asked "Dad, can I ask you a question?" so I said, "As long as you didn't get someone pregnant, go ahead."
He asked me if he could borrow $50 and I said "If you're just gonna spend it on booze you can go work for it."  
He just stared at me, looking real sad, then he went back inside. I started to contemplate if he actually needed something or if I was right about it just being beer money. I decided to trust him with the money and hope he wouldn't come back home reeking of liquor.  
About 4 hours later he came back looking incredibly proud of himself, he told me that he spent the money on a new suit to be made for him so he could get a job.
I was extremely happy about his decision to get a job, I had to sincerely apologize about accusing him of wanting cash for booze.  
I then asked him: Son, was there any change? He replied "Yes, About three fiddy." which he refused to give back. It was about that time I realized my son was a 7 stories tall crustacean from the paleolithic era. That damn loch ness Monster had gotten me again. Damnit, monsta, you ain't getting no three fiddy. </TEXT>
