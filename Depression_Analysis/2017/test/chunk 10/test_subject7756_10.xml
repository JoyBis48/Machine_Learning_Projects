totally equivalent.

	<TEXT>  I guess I'm worried that I'll make this choice, and then regret it. Or not do it and never be happy...

ah, the eternal dilemma of a trans person. damned if you do, damned if you dont. that's something i struggled with for the better part of 30 years (i've known since i was 7, came out when i was 39)

i dont have much to offer, except that as much as i pushed it away, and LORD knows i tried my hardest, it always came back with a vengeance. i just ran out of energy to fight it, and gave into the NEED to be a girl.

i'm much happier now, but i had to go thru a whole lot of shit to figure that out. i envy the kids who just know, and fight like hell to come out. 

 HUG 

i dont envy you the choice you have to make, and i wish i could offer more advice than "i'm sending positive vibes". but that's part of the journey that each of us has to figure out on our own. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Pride right now, for a lot of us, is a celebration of us surviving coming out of the closet. let the haters hate. we'll have the twinks in codpieces hanging from the sides of floats. we'll have the drag queens standing 7 feet tall with their beehive hairdos and sequined ball gowns. we'll have the big hairy bears holding hands in their leather harnesses. 

as much as queer culture has been assimilating into the mainstream, there will always be that element that  sets us apart. that comes from being a part of a minority, we will always be "different" than other people. and there's nothing wrong with that. it's perfectly normal for us.

and i'll leave you with Nomi's Pride speech from Sense8 because i havent heard a better one yet.

i'm just saying that there ARE people who detransition, and their trans journey is just as valid as ours. 

The problem here is that Cummings and Lopez are trying to impose THEIR outlook as the only one true way. I'm sure it seems that way to them, but it's wrong. wrong in every way it can possibly be. </TEXT>
