	<TEXT> I was scrolling and scrolling, looking for someone to have posted Anchorman. I almost thought it may have not been posted. Thank goodness you had the good sense to post it!

	<TEXT> Hahaha... Why do I have so many down votes? This wasn't a negative comment.  I was basically saying that I wish this was the first image I saw on Reddit. It is hilarious.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I just immediately opened this link in Safari and saved the image so I could share it with like 17 different people(ok, maybe 3 people). Can I just delete my Reddit account and open a new one so that I can tell everyone a year from now that this was the image that brought me to Reddit? This is probably my favorite thing I have seen on here, so far. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh my God... Thank you. I can't handle when people do this. A little piece of me dies when someone I love says "seen this" without something like "have you" preceding it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Your mother's behavior sounds extremely erratic. I really think that maybe your dad should push seeing a psychologist or something along those lines. If she has never been like this before, yet all of the sudden is so mean and unsupportive, there could be some much deeper issues going on. I am in NO WAY condoning her behavior. It makes me sick to think that a mother could be that demeaning and evil towards her own child and their spouse. I just think that maybe she could have developed some mental issues that need to be handled by a professional. However, I highly suggest that you have your Dad push the issue of seeing a professional. Until she can control her ludicrous behavior, I that you and your wife should cut off all contact from her. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have done both. Should such occasion arise that I am in need of nail polish remover, I would find a nail salon. A polish change is only about $5. </TEXT>
