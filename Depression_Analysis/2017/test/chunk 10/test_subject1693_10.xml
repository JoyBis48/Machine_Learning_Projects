	<TEXT> I live in Lebanon so nothing is ever available in my region. What  I did (and this works for my google chrome browser, not sure if it works for anything else) is install this thing called Hola! that helps me browse from other countries. I just tried it with the NPR website and it worked. But you should really count your blessings at least you have a chance to see Tame Impala live in Australia. Hope this helps. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> LOL try to find Amy Schumer's skit from her show. It's from season 3, and the episode is titled after the sketch I think it's called something like 'Sorry'. It's basically what you picked up on but she takes a funny twist on it. </TEXT>
