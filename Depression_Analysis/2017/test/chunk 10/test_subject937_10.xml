	<TEXT> The power of the Supreme Court rests almost exclusively on its perceived authority. If that credibility is lost, so is its power. Also, the Supreme Court has very little control over what subject matter it adjudicates - cases are brought to it, not the other way around.

The other two branches have military power (the President) and the power to tax and spend (Congress). </TEXT>

Clearly the public will not "punish" all businesses for being anti-homosexuality. We have a modern example where the business actually benefited from it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  I want to enable people to live freely.

Surely you acknowledge there are limitations (e.g., freedom to kill other people).

Non-discrimination in public accommodations is simply another reasonable limitation. The government has said that as a condition of receiving the perks of being a corporation, that corporation must follow certain rules, including not refusing service based on race.

The freedom argument only makes sense if you think, say, your freedom is unjustly restricted because you can't kill anyone you want. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Can you find any analysis of this private free speech principle? I've looked and haven't ever really found anything.

Personally, I don't think it exists (because it is unworkable). The public just assumes it does because of how important the well-known public free speech principle is.

I do agree that anyone who promises no censorship but then censors is hypocritical. But they didn't violate my freedom of speech.

I'd also like to point out that we're really talking about degree here. This site is already moderated and censored (no child porn).

Edit: As for questioning a private company that doesn't allow "free for all" free speech, I strongly disagree. Businesses are not public discourse vehicles. If my employees tried to debate the merits of slavery with my customers, I would likely fire them (with good reason). </TEXT>

Do I owe you freedom of speech? If I invite you over and you tell my child he shouldn't be able to get married because he's gay, am I wronging you in some way by asking you to leave?

	<TEXT> That's my point.

I'm really not aware of a concept of "free speech" apart from the public right. The government is supposed to get out of the debate so it can be freely had. And the point of all this is not to debate _per se_, it's for ideas to compete, and win or lose based on their merits (e.g., feeding babies = good, child rape = bad).

But when a private individual says "_X_ is wrong", it's no one's place to then force that individual to say otherwise. I'm gay but don't think I can go into Mike Huckabee's house and force him to give me a platform to advocate gay marriage. However, if he has opened his house up to debate (better analogy to Reddit), and then decides to close it - well, all we can do is leave.

But in both examples, no one's free speech has been violated. It just doesn't seem to be a concept that withstands scrutiny when invoked as between two private individuals.

Do you have a link to a treatise on non-public freedom of speech? I'm genuinely curious because this comes up every time a corporation does something that someone disagrees with (e.g., Chick-fil-A). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't think a "private" right of free speech makes sense as a concept.

How would that work? Is Reddit supposed to be prevented from banning FPH (and by whom)?

The marketplace of ideas isn't desirable simply to have concepts lobbed back and forth, it's desirable to discuss those concepts _and judge them_.

Edit: Can anyone link to an analysis of the "philosophical ideal" of a private right to freedom of speech?  </TEXT>

On the day the decision is released, supporters of gay marriage will gather for a rally outside of the Richmond County courthouse (Walton Way) between 4:30 PM and 7:00 PM.

The date is unknown but the time and place are being [coordinated](http://georgiaequality.org/issues/marriage-relationships/day-of-decision/) by Augusta Pride and Georgia Equality.

It's similar to refusing to refer to a gay spouse as "husband" because a husband is married to a wife (woman).

It's an understandable mistake given the nascency of the transgender movement. But knowing that it is offensive and refusing to adjust is not. </TEXT>
