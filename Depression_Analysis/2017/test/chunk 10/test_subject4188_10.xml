	<TEXT> Yeah great film and awesome visuals but all space films are fabricated anyway, it's impossible to build in space so we can only imagine space environments in our world </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Practical Effects v CGI </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Well going on the new Star Wars film coming out soon, it's really refreshing seeing them go back to its roots

I wish it would become the way forward for all studios now to see the benefits of real sets and practical effects

I think bad practical effects can stick out like a white elephant but at least practical models and effects will always age well whereas bad CGI never ages well and looks bland after a few years

In decades time you will always believe another world in older films because it is all real, nothing was faked whereas older CGI oriented films will look ropey as hell and because it was largely faked and made up, nothing is real to believe

I would say look at Jaws as a prime example, they had 3 model sharks that hardly ever worked but the film was a masterpiece, instead of having the shark as the focus, it had great characters and put suspense and that music to full effect meaning what you didn't see was far more unnerving

CGI in 3D looks ridiculous no matter how much money they throw at it, it will always look fake, then there is IMAX, I wish this format was the standard in films nowadays, all films should fill the frame and be as real and clear as possible, Nolan's Batman films are a shining example of it being used correctly </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well in recent images lately he looks like he's been hibernating for the past few years

Looks a bit rough and ready, maybe he went in to deep hiding from the authorities

So will we see him suited and booted soon, Scully looks like a million pounds, oh yeah </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Think it'd be great to have a few cameos occasionally featuring people from the Batman world

This can be actors, film makers, authors, artists or anyone connected with the Batman universe 

Imagine cameos from West, Clooney, Kilmer, Keaton, Bale, Conroy, Freeman, Basinger, Kidman or DeVito, Carrey, Pfeiffer, Jones, Thurman, Barrymore, Eckhart, Nicholson, Hardy, Hathaway and not forgetting Hamill </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There should be an episode discussions section down the right hand side for each season

Think this would be a great addition and give more coverage to lesser known episodes

It should be headed by season  episode style and would tidy the main section up a bit </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am guessing he had a murky past and Fish saved his life by giving him a job

Maybe he was a homeless thug or something and she hired him or something

Then am sure he would owe his life to her after she saved his, maybe that's it </TEXT>
