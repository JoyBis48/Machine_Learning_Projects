	<TEXT>   Why would he respond any other way than to just say sorry and get on living his awesome life? Why would he further antagonize an old ass dude who is clearly a hothead and is/was involved in very real crimes and likely murders?

GFK called him to clear up the situation, and AB posted some half-assed tweets ...then deleted them.

That was the last straw for GFK. 

AB brought it on himself. Many years ago, even saying what AB said would get hands laid on you. Not saying I disagree, but this is VERY serious. This is how GFK eats. GFK basically made it possible for people to even listen to AB's music. 

AB should have known he was playing with fire and he chose to pretend like he could boss up in front of the cameras and it didnt work. 

If AB was really about that life, he wouldn't have apologized.  </TEXT>

But hey, whatever you need to remind yourself that you think you're "above petty rap beef" when in reality, you're a sheltered clown with no sense of cultural perspective or appreciation instead of trying to gain some sense of masculinity from a genre of music you innately have no connection to. You're a vulture and I can tell you're struggling to come up with a riposte. 

You wouldn't tell me to "go die" in my face, so get real.  </TEXT>

GFK and the rest of the Wu are some of the most certified guys in the history of musical entertainment...we're talking FBI files and all of that. 

And for AB to even think the SLIGHTEST degree of disrespect would go un-noticed lets us know that we've gotten to a point where people think they can disrespect LEGENDS in the game </TEXT>

Its merely the RIGHT way. I don't care if rappers get along. I enjoy it...but don't pretend like everything is supposed to slide off your back and go unchecked. Some things you say has consequences and you need to be prepared to deal with it. 

But if you want to call it a "little jab" then you must understand how disrespectfully it will be received. 

Its telling that you don't think AB should have kept his mouth shut anyways. But no, its GFKs fault for putting AB in his place. </TEXT>
