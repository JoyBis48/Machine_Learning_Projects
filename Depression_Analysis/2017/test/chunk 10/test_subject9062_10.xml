	<TEXT> It's the NRA astroturfers. In reality, the majority of America is tired of the gun terrorism and the blood spilled every day. Not sure how much of it is covered in international press. It's abhorrent. Six toddlers this week were killed in America by guns. 
From Women Against Gun Violence's facebook page:
6th TODDLER SHOT THIS WEEK: A 3-year-old boy is in critical condition after shooting himself in the head with his grandfather's gun. The loaded gun had been left on the nightstand next to the bed where the toddler was napping. This is the sixth child, 4 and under, to be shot this week. http://ow.ly/PeMUA </TEXT>

	<TEXT> George C. Deutsch
Deutsch, who worked on Bush's reelection campaign, was appointed to NASA's press office. A creationist, Deutsch attempted to have the word "theory" added to every instance of the phrase "Big Bang" on NASA's website. He also allegedly kept the press from talking to Dr. James Hansen, an expert on global warming. He was released from his position in 2006 after blogger Nick Anthis discovered that Deutsch had lied on his rsum and had never actually graduated college. He later claimed that the only reason his appointment was controversial was because he was a Christian.


Oh fuck. I'm going to throw up.

Investigators are asking for the public's help in locating a 1970s full-size, single-cab Chevrolet or GMC pickup truck that is a faded single-orange color with black primer on the driver's side body. The pickup also has a full-size bed and round headlights.

Residents should pay special attention to the rendering's distinctive headlights, Larimer County Sheriff's Office spokesman David Moore said in a media briefing. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Bravo to you! Been so long since that's happened, I can't even say. Actually I can - it has been since 2010. When my ex left me alone with my kiddo not long after he was born I became 100% mom. Have him always, so no time to ever meet a partner. I'm both envious and happy for you.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In a post on an online forum for Texas supporters of the concealed carry of handguns, Cotton wrote, "he [Rev. Pinckney] voted against concealed-carry. Eight of his church members who might be alive if he had expressly allowed members to carry handguns in church are dead. Innocent people died because of his position on a political issue." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Dad gifted him a gun after he'd recently been arrested. Hoping to see charges against the father for that. I had a similar thought - could picture this full-on KKK picnic in the back country celebrating this shit. Seriously, I watched this PBS special [Klansville USA](http://video.pbs.org/video/2365401775/) recently that had the most appalling footage. I know the history, but seeing it is another level of nauseating.

	<TEXT> It's always bizarre to me the things that the FBI/NSA does crack ahead of time, and then stuff like this where he claimed to plan for six months, was a mess, more than likely posted shit online or searched - yet, they're sending out notices to people about illegally downloading media. I respect the rights of artists to make their money but GMAFB.  </TEXT>
