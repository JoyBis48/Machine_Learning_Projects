	<TEXT> Removed as a consideration for others.  Even though you used spoiler tags, they don't work on mobile devices.  If you want to talk about this better to use a spoiler flared post with a title describing the nature of what you are speculating here but not actually revealing anything..    

e.g. This post seems good for heavy speculation around teasers and trailers

	<TEXT> This sub is for discussing public information around battlebots.    If people want to post a reaction after something has been broadcast, I can't see any problem with that and encourage it.   

The only time spoiler flairs are really  used and people are asked to be  careful about titles is when people are discussing trailers and teasers leading upto the  broadcast of an episode.   

Other spoilers like results of matches gleaned from inside information are prohibited.

	<TEXT>  I'm not harping on about official videos

fair enough. Maybe i should have directed it at the OP.  I'm just a bit wary of a sentiment I see emerging on here that the nature of the source is important.  People have virtually stopped sharing current video clips in recent weeks and I blame it on a mild jerk about sticking to the official stuff.

 I just said that I don't think it is.

The link here is definitely the official youtube of the battle bot creators. 

You can see it link from :

http://battlebots.com/

https://www.facebook.com/battlebots

https://www.twitter.com/battlebots

https://www.youtube.com/user/battlebots
etc.  

Thankfully, the battlebot creators are good enough to make their stuff avialable to all countries.

abc who bought the series do their own marketing and have their own youtube, twitter etc complementing it.

	<TEXT> From variety

 And while most of it is meant to be viewable on plain old TVs, it would also feature special scenes that break the frame, allowing viewers equipped with virtual reality (VR) headsets to look around and explore the inside of a spaceship or immerse themselves in an alien firefight. Its a very interesting blend, said Betuel. The otherworldiness of it lends itself to VR.

Sounds like the alternative angles DVD feature.  Could be good for the success of the series which I'm looking forward to

	<TEXT> /r/battlebots 

A subreddit about robot combat and competitive robotics.  We are trying to get away from the TV brand and make our subreddit more about reddit and reddit's community.    So some kind of snoo would be great or even a whole design for our header.


Something that works on a dark background is probably a good idea.  Also it would be nice to have a snoo's as a user flairs.    

Any suggestions or help appreciated.

) .

People are still building bots and may share their local experiences in combat or engineering.

There is also the possibility of a reddit community funded bot but not heard from them for a while.

Review old stuff and general discussions.

Other television shows such as BBC Airheads might be of interest as it sounds like it is going to be of a similar flavour to robot wars.

Hopefully enough to keep all the robot combat subs ticking over.  It may be a little quieter though.

Ideas for this subreddit are most welcome especially people willing to implement them. </TEXT>

It was sufficient explanation because  in this revision you say, ... "I apparently can't ask you to upvote..." This is an indication that you are  starting to understand basic reddit rules !  I'm not sure why you feel entitled to any extra attention nor the need to dedicate your revision to me.

	<TEXT> Arguably it isn't really a spoiler.  It is just a teaser and has been put out there by Battlebots.  It is the same as any other episode preview or trailer.  This sub discusses public information around battlebots.  The real spoilers that we would probably remove rather than flair is inside information about the results of matches.  Another way to handle this is to just get rid of the spoiler flair altogether because it seems to imply that certain content is off limit when in fact it is on-topic.    I'd rather just encourage descriptive title such as "Episode 5 sneak peek" and even just use the flairs to add this information..


Just to note, we have started to sticky ["spoiler-free" discussion threads for episodes](http://redd.it/3cewrv
) for those that want to avoid teasers and previews.  We also flair things as "robot combat", "bot building" and "general robotics" where the topic isn't battlebots the tv  show.  These are also good for people that want to avoid teasers and previews.

	<TEXT> To address your specific issue, I have changed the existing "spoiler" flair  to block thumbnails as well as label posts.  


nsfw is a bit of a hack and hides too much content from casual users and people don't necessarily want to enable NSFW  on their reddit accounts to view battlebots tv gossip.  Only in very small tight knit communities would it work nicely.

I've removed your post because I don't want people marking stuff nsfw based on your suggestion.

The fact that they have not sold the licensing rights to a proper merchandising company makes me think it is unlikely we are going to see anything quality in the near future.  Next season maybe

	<TEXT> /u/Jamesterjim -  the top mod of /r/robotwars told me he has the original hyponodisc in his garage.  (don't try and figure out who he is or post personal information. I'm just username mentioning him here in case he wants to say hi but he is pretty inactive on that account.)  You are right that it was the most iconic robotwars bot.  It was definitely a collectors item if the original team did not hang onto it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sure support the official youtube channel.  Maybe we will put that channel in the sidebar along with hulu and abc go. 

However, ABC need to make their clips available internationally and not restricted by country.  There may be licensing reason not to do that ..e.g they want to sell the show in other countries.  However,  if it remains as it is , then the fan-made edits become the go-to option for discussion forums and finding them becomes a main topic for discussion.  I think the hype and interest we have on reddit encourages more people to watch the show live and so it isn't doing harm.

	<TEXT>  Nothing for females, yay. 

PR disaster for them.  They  are using udella.com which is a create online and sell .  So they deliberately chose not to have any female sizes, models or products . It would have just been a click  to make it happen.

  Actually, I'd MUCH rather have shirts from the builder teams representing my favourite bots and have some of the profit go to them for repairs and future designs.

This should happen.  They can promote them on /r/battlebots provided they stick around and talk to people.

	<TEXT> If you want, why not create a  thread for pre-episode [spoiler free] discussion of the fights and predictions .  I'm sure people will respect it and you can make your own rules in the OP for the discussion.  In fact, if you or someone wants to organise and police it properly, I can give them some moderator permissions and it can be a sticky at some point.

As you say, the show is putting the information out there and things like  promos are always going to be dissected in the comments.  I think it is easy to avoid direct discussion of the show and still find plenty of stuff here.  

The only stuff I would moderate against is things like the results of matches being revealed by people who have been to the filming.

Now what annoyed me most recently was Terminator Genysis -  every big plot twist was revealed in its [trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNU_jrPxs-0) </TEXT>

The critisim of filler was a big topic here : ["Lets cut to the chase: There was 10ish minutes of watchable TV in the first episode."](
http://www.reddit.com/r/battlebots/comments/3at8pz/lets_cut_to_the_chase_there_was_10ish_minutes_of/)

Below is what battlebots executive produce said to a subscriber of /r/battlebots regarding fillers

[It is the /r/battlebots top post of all time](https://www.reddit.com/r/battlebots/comments/3ax944/contacted_battlebots_was_not_disappointed/)


 
 HI Sepheroth998 - This is Greg the co-founder of BB and EP of the show. Ive been browsing this Subreddit (and all the comments elsewhere on social media. Ive also forwarded the link to the other EPswere listening.
 
 There are many answers to the many comments on the thread, but the bottom line is this:
 Were on ABC. 
 
 The show many hardcore fans seem to want would never be on ABC. It would more likely be on something like Discovery Scienceand a small cable network would never have the budget to produce the show we want. Because were on ABC we cant make a predominantly science / tech / engineering focused show. We would lose a huge chunk of the audience and never get a season 2. 
 
 We have to appeal to a wider range of people, hence the sports casters, tale of the tape, background packages, etc. Wall-2-wall robot fighting and would fatigue a majority of the audience and the show would fail. So we need to walk the line between fights and filler. 
 
 Do we have too much filler? I definitely think so. Im actually agreeing with many of the comments Im seeing. But Im a tech/robot geek (probably like most of the Reddit posters). And we cant make the show just for people like us, we need to go broader. In the end its all about balance.
 
 That said, more tech and real robot analysis is coming. Bobak Ferdowsi is a real robot engineer and he will be doing breakdowns of many of the robots in future episodes. And were learningmore importantly our production partner Whalerock is learning, and season 2 will most likely incorporate many of the suggestions were reading from fans, and the balance will be a better mix of fights and relevant talk. 
 
 So please stick with us and keep the faith. At worst use the fast forward button on your DVR : ) (or better yet just Mute and get a snack)
 
 And we did try and get Grant on the showjust didnt work out this time around.
 
 Email me anytime
 Greg

	<TITLE> Experience with Twitter feeds ? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-07-04 15:52:01 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> A lot of subreddits have twitter feeds pumping out links from the new queue.  

I made one for /r/Battlebots .
https://twitter.com/RBattlebots


I want it to grab some of the audience who follow  #battlebots 




However, it was quickly banned from appearing in search results.

That seems fair because it was just spamming links.  

So I want to know how did other subreddits get their spamming twitter accounts into good standing with Twitter.  I don't know much about twitter.  

Should I be asking my reddit subscribers to interact with it?

Should I give the new account some time to overcome age limitations ?

Should I stop posting links and just post the titles ?

Is my account banned requiring a new account?


So the questions are mainly about how to use twitter to spam reddit links .   I think there are some general lessons and warnings here for setting up a twitter feed .  Any help apprecaited.

Use it in whatever way you want.   Add pages and improve the formatting if it helps.   Your account needs to have had a small amount of activity in this subreddit to edit it.  If someone wants to put a lot of work into it and curate it, I'll throw them some mod powers to help them manage it.    Meanwhile, I want to try and make sure that our sidebar is promoting community content.

Again, it is just for fun and to identify who is actually a builder of a particular robot .  "Verified Roboteers "  need to remember not to edit the text of your flair or else you will lose your verification status. 


*Posting:*

I just wanted to remind people that we are interested in everything around competitive robots and not just Battlebots the television show.  So feel free to share some crazy Ideas, concept art and stuff from other robotic events and tv shows.     
 
/r/battlebotsmeta  exists for ideas, feedback and whatever .   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Outside the US, there are no options.  Our sidebar has some official US links.  Full episodes are easy to find on youtube. So it doesn't look like they are clamping down on it.  I'd say that it is in their interests to get people widely interested in the brand again in the 1st season.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Verified Roboteer flairs </TITLE>

-----------------

Only Mods can add this type of flair in the flair setting menu 

https://www.reddit.com/r/battlebots/about/flair/

Mods need to add  "VER" as the CSS class and then save. 

This adds the text "Verified Roboteer" and the yellow background.


---------------
Possible discussion: 

Is the styling right? 

Who gets flairs? 

Do we need any other types of flair?



I don't want it to be untidy and I want people to feel equal unless they have some genuinely useful experience/achievement that a flair may help advertise.  I can do some fancy hovering or animation but then I thought it is better to show the information.


It might be cool to have a selection of grey flairs that users can choose from for fun.  But I'm not bothered to do that work at the moment..

------------------
Edit: I don't think the old flair templates were set up quite right.  I cleared all the flair templates.  It wasn't a thought out decision, so sorry to whoever took the time to do that and if it was that way for good reason that I did not understand.

Anyway....

It is now user editable text rather than a limited range of flairs.  

Those who change their text to their own bot can then get verified by mods.  

The old system was too dull and people were choosing flairs like "Robot Wars".  I think it is more fun to let people choose their own text in flairs.

	<TEXT> The mods help enable the community.  Part of this means that the door is left open for people willing to step up and make things happen.  Are you offering to do something specific and useful ?  What is your plan for "some energetic positive moderation"?   The other question is, does your plan actually require moderator powers or mod support.  

All the mods so far were added by me for a reason  and they have done a lot of good for the subreddit both in hard work, giving it credibility and offering experience.  No one is holding this subreddit back and we are all keen to make as many ideas and activities happen.   We also need "positive community" as opposed to an "entitled community" .   </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2015-06-28 20:57:15 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Big Spoilers

For me spoilers are things like who wins and loses matches . If I see such information in the title of a post before a TV show I will remove it and maybe ask the user to repost it with a better title. If I see a title of a post warning of spoilers inside, I may tolerate it depending if the information is important and more than just spoiling the tv show for others.


Mild Spoilers 

Mild spoilers are things like photos of bots, tv adverts and who is participating. If the title of a post reflects the content, then there is nothing for moderators to do. If a post title invites people to look at photos, adverts or match line-ups, then a user can to decide for themselves if they want to look at it. They don't need any extra warnings as it is obvious that it is a mild spoiler of sorts.
If people are so adverse to mild spoilers and incapable of reading titles, then they should not be browsing a subreddit about battlebots.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> These have been well done and encouraged some good interactions. 

However, I think they can be technically improved by assigning CSS classes. within the flair menu.  With the right styling  "verified roboteers" or teams can have colored flairs or icons.  

I can do the CSS for this but if we want to have some icons and graphics, then some help and ideas.   

I could add a  flair specific mod in the same way other subreddits do ?


----

There is also an argument to keep the flairs similar and dull as this encourages an atmosphere where there are no "power users" .

	<TEXT> At the moment we allow anything related to competitive robotics.

We aren't removing anything and accept all behavior.  I don't think a tv show is going to bring out the worst in people but who knows.

 I think the community is really good and mature.  The downvotes will sort out the really bad trolls. 

If anything is removed (comment or link), we inform the user unless it is obvious and random spam.   

Some of those repetitive questions such as where to find episodes can be removed if we catch them early and can redirect to an older thread.   </TEXT>

Moderators simply need to edit the sidebar text to change these

https://www.reddit.com/r/battlebots/about/edit/ 

Add this to the **top** of the sidebar:

    * [](#notice)[Thing 1](link-to-thing-one)
    * [](#important)[Thing 2](link-to-thing-two)


----------


The css code for this change
    
    .side .titlebox .md ul:first-of-type li a[href="#notice"] + a:before {
        content:"NOTICE";
        background-color:#A0C55F
    }
     
    .side .titlebox .md ul:first-of-type li a[href="#important"] + a:before {
        content:"IMPORTANT";

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> We don't promote full episode links in any official capacity . There are a lot of people who cannot access the show as it is only broadcast in america and there is literally no other way to access it. Hence, we tolerate it. The sub also tolerates other long clips of the show because people want to talk about them.
You are right that it can be a problem as piracy can strangle a show. So this policy may change if the sub grows very large, if we get targeted by spammers, if the community demand the mods take action (as you are now), if battlebots talks to us and explain that it is actually a problem or I start to see DMCA takedown requests in /r/chillingeffects .
Right now, we are trying to grow the community and see what they want. So no heavy moderation or rules just yet but rather encouraging people to talk and share stuff. This and other possible rules is definitely something that we should keep talking about though.
Meanwhile, feel free to point out the problem to the people sharing links either directly or by addressing the community in a self post.

--------------

Our sidebar now caries links to official episodes (US only) .  This is to show that we do primarily support people using the official methods to access the show. </TEXT>
