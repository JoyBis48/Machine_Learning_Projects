	<TEXT> My mom is just getting more and more mad at me as she figures out how messed up I am.

A girl I look up who I thought was 'recovered' and has helped me through certain things is suddenly binge eating (like two whole jars of nut butter in one day, pints of ice cream even though she's weight-restored) and that scares me.

Is giving up an option? I know it's not, I just wish someone would tell me it is. I find it really hard to think people can get truly 'better'. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It really is a bad day. Yours truly can't get away with nothin' and is missing out on hibachi :(

Maybe try to scare yourself with how bad IP is? Being monitored on the clock drives me insane. </TEXT>
