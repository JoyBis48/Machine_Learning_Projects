	<TEXT> That's exactly it. Thank of a single spot in space the the longboarder passes through every time they complete a circuit.

Now think of how much time the camera sees the longboarder versus the background. Clearly, the background is what is seen for a majority of the time. Since there's no extra light in the longboarder vs the background, the background is what shows up in the final picture!

You could do many things to change what shows up and get various results and degrees of "transparency" for the boarder dude/dudette  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My friend had a stress fracture, and after six weeks, she was fine. Assuming yours is similar and not much more serious, It's just rest that you need. Once you get back to running, you'll start off slower of course, but you'll be back to your original form in a few weeks.

The important thing is to listen to your feet once the cast comes off, and not push it. Two years later, the few weeks you lose won't matter. But you'll regret it terribly if you push yourself and cause a more serious injury. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm attending a friend's wedding in Switzerland and I then plan to hike along the via alpina from Geneva to Nice (about 550 km). Does anyone know the scene in terms of camping along there?

From what I read, there are a lot of huts. But are there enough that I won't need to take a tent along at all? What about a stove? 

Any other hints and tips would be greatly appreciated! </TEXT>

The study says this too, though:

 Westerners with a Christian background also became more tolerant after being exposed to Buddhist concepts, though only among those with a predisposition for valuing the welfare of all people and an aversion towards authoritarianism

I wonder what they mean by by that...that only those with a predisposition for valuing the welfare of all people had their prejudices reduces? </TEXT>

On other hand: in India, Buddhism rose as a response to the caste system, i.e. to reduce prejudice that was at the time, extremely inherent to Hinduism.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> How do you guys know when a camera is right for you? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-03-29 17:49:27 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> When I was in grad school, I had no money and my brother gifted me a D40. I loved that thing and took thousands of pictures over 5 years.

Now I'm a little better off financially and am looking for a camera...I thought having more options would lead to a much better choice, but I've now bought and returned/resold the following cameras (and corresponding lenses at times):

EPL3 - NEX6 - D5300 - D7000

I haven't felt the same magic or freedom I felt with the D40. In fact, I'm beginning to feel like I'm setting myself up for disappointment in always looking for a better camera, but on the other hand, every camera feels like I'm settling.

Do any of you feel the same about your gear? Any advice?

EDIT: Thanks for all your responses, guys. Getting out there and shooting is the important part. I get that, but I really have to train myself not to think of the gear. It was easy when I couldn't afford better when it was forced upon me that I couldn't have better gear. Photography really is an emotional thing for me, and I really want it to stay that way :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think there's an India Coffee House in Bangalore too...somewhere near MG road.

I can give you directions to the shop where my dad buys his coffee...maybe you'll like it:

Go to Gandhi Bazaar (Uber if you don't know how to get there) and ask someone for directions to "Srinivas Coffee Roasters". You can walk there from wherever you get off the cab. It's just like I described -- small place with one guy. It really doesn't look anything like anything you would find in Forum mall. I just looked for it and there certainly wasn't a website. You might encounter broken english :) While there, eat the masala dosa at Vidhyarthi Bhavan -- it's awesome. Actually...eat the spicy masala dosa there and then have a cup of coffee! I do that at least once on every trip back home. Sorry...got a bit carried away!

Also buy the Indian coffee filter and learn to use it if you don't know how already. Have it Indian style w/ hot/steamed milk (but no/less sugar) and see how you like it :) 

If you want, you can PM me, and I'll give you more details!

	<TEXT> There are lots of shops that sell beans. India has a very strong coffee culture, but it's not well advertised like here, and the culture (as it existed before) is very different. The shops are really small (source: I'm from Bangalore). The shops aren't fancy, or anything. They're just a guy and lots of beans and big burr grinder if you want them ground. My dad was telling me that when he was a kid, they would buy green coffee beans, go get them roasted at a roaster and then come back home and grind them by hand at home. 

The fact that Indian coffee is milk and sugar doesn't make it automatically bad. In my house in India, the stuff we get out of our coffee filter is so thick that you have to add milk. The milk is part of the flavor, and not there to hide it. It's just a different way of making coffee. Plus we don't add sugar at home. It's also drunk in small amounts at once, but lots of times. If you visit south Indian homes, you'll see that the first thing they offer you is coffee. Conversations happen over coffee in every house. 

I use an Aeropress and Hario mill and Stumptown at home here in Seattle, but when I visit home, I really don't feel like I'm having inferior coffee when I drink the super-strong 4 oz cups of filtered freshly ground coffee and milk.

What India does not have is a strong CAFE culture. The cafes (so far) have really bad coffee, that I can agree. Cafe Coffee Day, Costa Coffee...all of them sucked when I tried them. 

Plus, they're all aping the espresso-latte trend instead of showing off India's own culture. This is not in itself a bad thing. I do hope Starbucks helps Indian cafes bring up their latte game.

EDIT: I just realized -- North India is, indeed like you say, predominantly tea country. I'm from the South, so results may vary. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Doesn't this paper assume that there _is_ in fact, condemnation of the Zors' treatment of the Aree?

It seems the moral "consistency" becomes subjective. If you condemn the treatment and are still non-vegan, you are being inconsistent

If you don't condemn the treatment (food chain, tastes good, law of land, mighty wins) and you're non vegan, consistency is maintained.

	<TEXT> There's actually a few things to consider:

1. Timeline: Most companies that release "crippled" products do so because of deadlines and timelines, not because of increased customer satisfaction along the way.
2. Competition: I think this is an extremely important factor, especially in cars. If a company releases a detuned/undertuned car, a different company will release a better performing car for the same price. Car 1 will be reviewed badly, and sell badly. 

On the other hand, if companies *could* get away with it, they absolutely would. Intel comes to mind, as mentioned in some of the other comments

Edit: Ethics aren't important at all. An ethical company tries to make customers happy WHILE maximizing profits AND staying ahead of the competition in at least one factor of their product/design </TEXT>

Today, I went on a date. The date actually went well. 

But...I came back home and cried. Me...a 31 year old male. I don't know why I'm crying.

The scariest thing is that I thought I had close friends. Then I thought of who I could talk to right now about the fact that I'm dying here, and there was no one. Not family, not friends.

I've gone into a shell after the last few months and I can't come out. I don't know what to do. I'm lost... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Drag files here or just start typing. Imagine those poor files, being dragged everywhere, against their will.

But then, it isnt really against their will, is it?

People are rioting in Missouri and here I sit on my bed in the bedroom me a sort of conservative Indian guy on the bed in the bedroom sort of high and sort of drunk and that couchsurfing lady is in the living room just about five minutes away from snoring and weve just seen Guardians of the Galaxy and people are rioting in Missouri and a sort of innocent kid died and a sort of guilty cop now is free except hes sort of not a cop any more but all the punctuations gone away but the feelings stay and I feel sort of sad for all the kids that die but Im so far way that I dont really understand and there I can see the punctuation coming back.

Heartbreak doesnt make a sound, though Im sure there have been poems written about it. Maybe its the sound of silence shattering in slow motion. Is the sound of my heart breaking here louder than the sound of glass and guns and riots and rage in Missouri? Is my sorrow greater than their anger? It is not greater, but I cant help that it is a shallow pond that is getting me wet, as many roaring waterfalls plummet with the force of a million voices elsewhere.

I wish all the grammar and all the structure would leave, not needed by either me the writer or you the reader, and we would communicate with pure meaning. Who knows what is lost between my mind and the keys and and all the electricity and your screen and your eyes and your brain. Do we really know each other?

I think I know the sound that heartbreak makes. Every heart makes a different sound. Even the same heart sounds different at different times. Sometimes its a glass of whiskey, shattering against the wall. Sometimes its a fist punching a wall again and again and again and again till the sound is softened by swelling. Sometimes, its the silence of tears. Sometimes its the joy of freedom. There is no certainty and certainly no consistency. 

People are shooting at police. Police are shooting at people. Police are people. How does it get to this? 

My day today wasnt bad. My head is aching a bit. Its a bit heavy and Im high and low. High and low. I was laughing at the movie, now Im saddened by Missouri. And Israel. And immigration. I wish everyone found peace, you know. Not the peace of war and peace. But the peace of a light heart. The peace of a satisfactory silence. The peace of a broken heart hopefully picking up its own pieces and patching itself back together. Everyone should be at peace.

I remember Kalalau. I remember those people living there on the beach. They were at peace. But their peace was born of ignorance. Could peace come with knowledge? Could there be peace in misery? 

The silence fills my ears and I can feel my eyes closing. I yawn bigly. Ill be asleep soon, while the world burns in a hundred thousand places. While fifty thousand people have bad sex and fifty thousand people have good sex, and fifty thousand people sleep in their bed with no one to hug.

I think you find what you look for in the world. Forrest Gump, he had it wrong. You get the chocolates you pick out, and the chocolates you pick from that big box of life chocolates, it isnt chosen by you. Your choice is but the interface to a million little events and books and scoldings and experiences that lift your arms, open your fingers, reach for that chocolate that is either joy or sorrow or anger or lust or sloth or video games or mountains or god or God or NoGod or MaybeGod or love or hate or regret or joy and it all those things in the past and present that guide you into the future where you become one or not or die or live or do something or nothing but even nothing is something. Maybe its because Im high that the full-stop runs away from me and my thoughts have to run really hard to catch up but because theyre running and stumbling, nothing is clear and everything is a mess of words on the page like the villains head after its smashed in with a hammer.

Except, I dont know my thoughts and I dont know what a smashed-in head looks like. Except in the movies.

Guardians of the Galaxy: Good movie.
Sad news is sad, but there is hope.
Some people will live and every one will die.

Good night. </TEXT>

1. No biking directions, which is okay, because I can bike where i can walk
2. No Google Now integration. This is the thing that breaks it for me. My most common use case for maps is talking to my phone and telling it to navigate to home, or a restaurant. I wish Google gave us the option/API to use Here Maps as the default. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm just tired. Today, as I was driving my car, I was by the lake and just wanted to drive in it. I have no clue why I didn't. Maybe I'm a coward.

There are people who love me, I don't know why. Maybe because they've never seen me at my lowest, or even low. 

Suicide sounds so peaceful, for me at least. And if there's one thing I'm certain of, it's that it's only my pain that I'm feeling now. But even as I'm thinking of killing myself, I know I won't do it. I just like to dwell for a bit in the thought of a final peace.

I can go rest my face on the grill to distract myself, or cut off one finger. But I won't do that either, and I don't know why. Maybe I don't want my family to go through all that drama. Maybe I don't want to disappoint them. But then, am I really giving them joy if it's all a lie and I curl up into my blanket and cry the night away as soon as I turn around?

I don't know. I read the posts on here a lot. You guys are brave, both the ones that find a reason to live on and the ones that don't. I feel like a coward...just hanging on to a rope of nothing because I don't know to do anything else. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I was glissading about 3 weeks back and injured my lower back. So now, for the last two weeks, my back has been hurting a decent amount. Not too much - I can walk and talk and work and be happy without having to cry out loud.

However, I decided to take some time off running to rest while I recover. The problem is, it's been 3 weeks and I still haven't recovered fully...and I really want to get back to running! All the trails must be so lonely without me.

I'm 30 now, and my body isn't what it used to be at 22 :) So I ask, is it okay to run with lower back pain, or should I wait it out a bit more?

	<DATE> 2014-08-12 17:17:45 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> This is an emotional rant more than anything else...feel free to ignore.

I saw all these reviews saying the NEX-6 took amazing photos...and maybe it does. 

I came to the NEX-6 from a Nikon D40 with an Olympus E-PL3 in between. I was determined to reduce the size of my camera bag.

At first the E-PL3 just felt wrong, and now the NEX-6 just feels wrong. The Nikon D40 somehow just felt...real. 

Maybe it was the viewfinder? The NEX-6 has an EVF, but it's not really much better than seeing it on the LCD. Maybe I'm just technologically backward? 

I don't know...Maybe I just need time to get used to it? Anyone else have a similar experience?

EDIT: Wow..I was off reddit for a day...thanks for all the responses! I'll give it more time and if it doesn't work, with upgrade to a nice DSLR....maybe even go all the way to full frame..My backpacking bag won't be happy, but maybe I will!

	<TEXT> I've been using a Hario Mill Skerton + Aeropress for the last year, and I've been quite happy with it. However, I drink only a cup or two a day at home.

My dad is visiting and he drinks a lot of coffee. I bought a larger french press for him, and now I'm thinking of getting an electric burr grinder so he doesn't have to grind by hand all the time. 

What's the difference between a $35 one (http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004T6EJS0) and the Baratza Encore that I see recommended on here over and over. Is the Encore really worth all that much more, assuming I won't be using either for anything other than the Aeropress or the french press?

EDIT: You guys convinced me thoroughly. I bought the Encore. My dad will probably be mad to see me spending $130 on "just a thing to grind coffee"...but Oh well...the taste of the coffee better be worth it :) </TEXT>

I'm in agreement with all of your rules, except for keeping tabs on my shoes. But only because I've never done that. I will keep all of this in mind. We have very similar running philosophies :)

The 50 I'm looking at is not really an event. It's the West Rim trail in Zion National Park. 48 miles, 7000 ft gain, lots of fun :)

Good luck at Mt. Hood!

	<TITLE> How do I get to 50 miles (from 20)? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-06-30 04:21:05 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> What's a good training program to get to 50 miles? My most recent trail run was a 20 mile trail run (Peterson ridge).

I have very good endurance (well...relative to my peers, I guess). The 20 miles didn't tire me too badly, but my feet were hurting quite a bit. So, I guess I should have increased distance in a more planned manner, rather than jumping into it like I did. 

What kind of training program should I follow? The simpler, the better...I like my runs to be peaceful. Pain is okay, but I don't want to be constantly monitoring my heart rate and so on...Ideally, the program would get me to 50 miles in 9-10 months of enjoyably torturous running, even if a bit inefficiently. </TEXT>
