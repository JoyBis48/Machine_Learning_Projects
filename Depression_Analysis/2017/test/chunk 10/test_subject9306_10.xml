	<TEXT> The goal of the conversation is to enjoy the conversation. If you're willing to spend ages having a boring conversation just to get laid, then you're way over invested in sex for the sake of sex, and you need to start expanding some other areas in your life. E.g being more than a walking penis, and treating women like more than a walking vagina. Why would you ever want to be with someone who isn't interesting to talk to? </TEXT>

That's not because you're good looking or more muscly or whatever. For some people, 'romantic' behaviour - flirting, interpreting signals, displaying interest in the opposite sex, etc - just doesn't come natural at a base level. These kinds of people need to learn the long and hard way. And often being the kind of person who is very rational, intellectual and analytical, it most suits their natural talents to go about learning how to do these things in this way.  </TEXT>

Dude, for your sake, you need to go an read a LOT more inner game stuff, because these beliefs are a) extremely shallow and b) fucking you up.

Edit: you're also fixated on 'opening' my eyes.' Why should I, or anyone? If any male on this planet who is butt ugly is capable of pulling hot girls, why should he 'open his eyes' and give that up for your theory? </TEXT>

There is no such thing. Nothing about your personality is nailed down. Nothing about is anything other than what you decide it is. Right now you are deciding that your personality sucks, and that's all that will come out in your behaviour.

After some work and dedication I am now DLing 70kg (140 pounds) - slightly less than my body weight. Now, or at any stage of that process, if someone had told me to try DLing 160kg (320 pounds) I would have very seriously injured myself. That is not a mental blockage or lack of effort. 

Edit: My PTs DL is about 180kg and he's been training for 14 years.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You say you're balding and overweight? I'm moderately overweight (about 28% BF) and, as much as I know that I shouldn't care and be more self confident, I'm struggling with it. I'm lifting four times a week and working with a PT, but that isn't going to show for another four months at least, and in the mean time I'm really struggling to approach and display genuine interest because I don't see how any girl could find me attractive. I'm a university student, and for all of my advantages - fairly smart, high achieving, good sense of humour - there's always other guys who also have them and are ripped. 

What have your experiences been like with women when at less than 'average' physical attractiveness? How old are you? Is it different after uni when less men seem to be in good physical condition? How did you learn to not care about your body or face? Do you find that you need exceptional inner game compared to the men around you to make up for it, or is it more or les equal? How much do girls ACTUALLY care at various ages? I realise that having muscles and a low BF% is always an advantage but that doesn't happen overnight and I'm fucking sick of being single. I want to start working on game now, not in six months, because I feel like I'm wasting time and potential effort/knowledge/advancement. 

I realise that's a lot of questions, don't feel pressured to write me a book. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.  </TEXT>

No, don't be *upset* by the interaction or let it affect your happiness, confidence or sense of self-value, but there's nothing wrong in being irritated by someone being rude to you. 

IMHO the whole point of Models is that you can be an attractive 'alpha' male without sacrificing your morals or being a dick to people, so at the end of the day, as long as whatever you're doing doesn't affect your happiness, confidence, or ability to give value, it really doesn't matter. Be nice to people who don't deserve it if you want to. You're then the bigger person.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Got rejected yesterday. I'm 20 and I've had one girlfriend, which lasted for a month before she cheated on me. I'm trying hard to be confident and outgoing, but I can't help but think it's because it looks like baby me's face got run over by a tractor. Give me tips on things to change? Beard or no beard? Without facial hair it's hard to believe that I actually have a jawbone, so i've been rocking it for about two years now, but I'm not sure. If there was one thing I could change it would definitely be my nose, I want to chop it off. And then replace it with one half its size. Been going to the gym for about a month and a half, no change yet but I'm working on it, still have about 10% body fat to drop and a lot of muscle to gain before that looks decent. 

You're not getting any pictures of me smiling, I have braces at the moment and it's definitely still a work on progress. I know that looks hideous so there's not much point making anyone else endure it.

Me at the moment ([front](http://i.imgur.com/x2oxBE7.jpg), [side](http://i.imgur.com/l7qbxV7.jpg)), just got out of bed, had a pretty average haircut yesterday. 

[Me two years ago, with no beard](http://i.imgur.com/gEkthbW.jpg) - keep in mind that this was a professional photoshoot and it has been touched up, I just don't know in what way.

	<TEXT> On top of what the others are saying, I think you could use a better haircut. </TEXT>
