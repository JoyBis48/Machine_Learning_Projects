	<TEXT> I may be wrong. Unlike water,  bandwidth has a very large and beneficial use to society, a merit good with a large positive externality - unlike water (I am aware we need water to survive). The benefits vary from providing education, training,  entertainment, political accountability (at least in democratic nations), healthcare, increases long-run aggregate supply, allows for more perfect knowledge etc. Examples abound. Therefore, bandwidth, internet and similar other goods and services (such as Wikipedia), ought to be provided for free as their benefits far outweigh the costs. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I may be ignorant/wrong but I believe in my humble opinion that finance/accounting/bookkeeping is the only real tangible thing one can learn to prepare for business - everything else being learnt through experience. I also believe it is the bedrock of all other departments (marketing, hr, production) and that by learning it first it would help in the long run (not that I didn't learn about marketing either). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey!
I am a pre-university (IB) student 17 years old) living in Paris. I would want to apply to UCL, LSE and/or Oxford and I would want to have some work experience. I already am doing a 3 week internship this summer, as well as read up on a lot of material. Just as John D. Rockefeller began almost two hundred years ago, finance and numbers is something that I appreciate and having some bookkeeper experience is something I will value greatly. I understand that I would only be of limited use, but I would love it if you could give me a chance.

Here are reasons why I may interest any of you:

I do not require any pay at all

I have free time

I consider myself very knowledgeable (albeit inexperienced) for my age*

I have a good grasp on Microsoft Excel, Access and other software

I have satisfactory grades: 
near perfect IGCSEs (including ICT HL, Business HL and maths HL)
40 in IB (according to latest report) (including Math SL and Economics HL)

I am willing and able to provide more information as well as evidence that I actually can/did these things.

I would want to participate in accounting, finance, etc. for any of your firms. PM me for further details if you wish so.
I hope I am not sounding too pretentious or arrogant, I am just excited at the prospect of working with entrepreneurs, craving to be one one day. 

PS. I will only work for an actual start-up and/or SME. It will have to be online as I am not able to move away from Paris.

*I have already began investing in the stock market after reading both the II and SA, as well as 'Titan: Rockefeller' and many other books; I have pursued small entrepreneurial ventures and have already worked in a couple of events organising several things. However, I overall lack the experience that you may require of me, and I am willing to compensate by working hard and learning fast, without pay. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A very utopian and unrealistic idea, but what about: a nation where a majority of people are shareholders of companies that use robots. Incomes of most people would derive from capital gains and dividends, whilst a minority gain their income from managerial roles (CEOs, politicians, non-profits, military, etc). I've thought about it, but being 17, I would love to have this idea challenged. </TEXT>
