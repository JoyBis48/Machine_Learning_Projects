	<TEXT> Okay, in this book I'm working on I have character A and B. They're sisters. A is a button down, rule-following, reliable salt of the earth type who works the family garden, and B is a more devil may care, adventurous one and the parents tolerate it because in her adventures she has made the family more money than her sister. Both of them want to leave home but the outside world is too big and scary since their village is surrounded by vast jungle and on the other side of that are strange communities. One day there is a huge crisis in the village and in the end, both of them are instrumental in saving the day. 

Which sounds more interesting as a postscript: 

A. Characters A   B, having proven to themselves that they're up to facing the dangers of life head on and left their family with enough money to get by without them, plunge into the largely unknown darkness seeking new sights, new experiences, etc. Character B is more outspoken in her enthusiasm while B is more quietly excited. 

B. Character A finds that now that she's experienced real danger, she's more of an adrenalin junkie than her sister, who learns that real danger isn't as much fun as the trouble she used to get in. So  Character A wants to set out on this adventure and Character B goes along to look out for her sister and to not look like a coward. 

Thank you for your time  </TEXT>

Anyway, if the sacrifices to keep the "Gods" happy affect every country in CitW, they can effect every religion. Different types of religious/supernatural figures are featured in the movie and various supernatural means are used to defeat the monsters that get unleashed (e.g. the Japanese kids putting their pursuer back to spiritual sleep) One of those in question can be the God/Satan of Christian theology. That hand that emerges at the end of the movie? That's Satan's or a being like it. And then he made his way to LA for This is the End.  </TEXT>

This morning I did some work digging up a shrub in an undershirt and missed putting sunscreen on both my upper shoulders. So when I took my shirt off, I had chocolate arms, strawberry lower shoulders, and vanilla upper shoulders and clavicles.

Tried to take a picture but my camera's a potato so it didn't really photograph very well.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yesterday there was this guy who looked in pretty decent shape. He was there for awhile with someone and as far as I saw he was just doing a typical workout. But seemingly with every rep, he would make a "HHHRRRUUKK!" noise like he was about to vomit. It didn't sound like physical exertion. And he did this for half an hour, really loudly every time. I wasn't the only one that noticed him either, I heard other people commenting on it. So weird.  </TEXT>
