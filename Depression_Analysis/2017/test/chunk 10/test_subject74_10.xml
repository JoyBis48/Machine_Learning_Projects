	<TEXT> * If you're into drug store stuff...Definitely Herbal Essences 'naked' shampoo and conditioner. 


* If you use salon stuff, bedhead was always my favorite...S factor smooth/shine products would be perfect from the sounds...All bedhead stuff smells delicious enough to eat as well! 


* Andddd, hair gets tangled easier the longer it is...Maybe try to keep it up when exposed to wind etc. That might help a bit as well </TEXT>

Another option would be to make it wisped with the thinning sheers...like twist the hair and then cut to get a wispy look. </TEXT>
