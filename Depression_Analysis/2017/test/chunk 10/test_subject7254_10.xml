	<TEXT> Yes, the USA supplied Free Syrian Army factions with Tow missiles to fight Syrian forces.

Yes, the FSA now has the name ISIS in Western media.  They are the same force.

'In February 2015, The Carter Center listed 23 groups within the Southern Front of the Free Syrian Army that have been documented using US supplied TOWs.[23]'

Edit: Would love to hear the Obama followers explain how American TOWs w/  scratched off serial numbers made it to Syria.
