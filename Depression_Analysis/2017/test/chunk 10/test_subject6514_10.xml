	<TEXT> Thanks for your advice Scrubstadt.  By the way, this:

If you accept that dying will happen, and try your best to learn from your deaths, the deaths themselves will become less frequent.

is a badass quote. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi everyone,

This game is so highly rated and looks amazing, but I would really love to know why it is that you like it so much. I really want to buy this game and like it, but the idea of constantly dying and reloading in games doesn't really sound like my cup of tea, it just sounds like punishment.

Do you really die every 5 seconds like people say? And do you have to be an amazing hardcore gamer to be able to play? Are the lowered difficulty levels?

Any advice is much appreciated!

	<TITLE> 4G Wifi Router as an alternative to ADSL2+ Router? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-07-14 05:27:00 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi guys,

Located in BNE, Australia. I have been having huge problems with ISP traffic congestion on my ADSL2+ network between the hours of 5-10pm, which I understand is peak traffic time. What is frustrating me is that there appear to be few other options available for a steady data transfer rate at all times.

My wired connection runs at 10mbps during the day, then drops as low as 0.5mbps to 2mbps at peak times, making streaming video difficult.

Is a 4G WIFI router a viable alternative? I get download rates of 100mbps over the 4G cellular network at peak times and this would be far more preferrable.

Does anyone have any experience with this sort of thing? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I thought so. So why are some Christians so up in arms and using homosexuality as their argument? Seems if they have a problem with being gay they should protest that instead of marriage? Marriage has never been a solely Christian tenement so I feel I must be missing something here......??? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Can someone help me out? (non-American here). 'Man shalt not lie with a woman as they do a man, it is an abomination' - this seems to be the go-to argument. But they're referencing homosexuality which has been legal for more than 50 years. To me this is not the point in case, today's ruling is a victory for civil liberties and equal rights, not actually being gay. Or am I wrong here? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Lots of employee comments here, I wondered if anyone could lend advice from the other angle; I am a manager of a small business, I have four fantastic hard working staff under me. I can almost never fault their effort and detail the put in. How can I reward them for the work and show that I appreciated them? And also, if the constantly give me 100%, how can I make sure they don't burn out and keep enjoying what they do?

Any suggestions welcome - thanks all. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [Opinion] Laptop GPU - 965M or 970M </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-05-17 10:10:12 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi all, trying to decide whether the extra ~$400 is worth it to upgrade to the [P37W](http://www.gigabyte.com.au/products/product-page.aspx?pid=5349) from the lead in [P37K](http://www.gigabyte.com.au/products/product-page.aspx?pid=5375). The laptops are not cheap so I am trying to keep it reasonable. I specifically need a relatively high powered, thin gaming machine with internal optical drive at a min 17" screen.

From what I can see, the only difference is the upgrade from a [GTX 965M](http://www.notebookcheck.net/NVIDIA-GeForce-GTX-965M.134120.0.html) to a GTX 970M in the P37W. According to GPUBoss, the 970M is up to 35% more powerful, has a larger memory bus and higher clock speed.

Does anyone have an opinion as to whether the GPU upgrade would be worth the extra cash? I'd love some help. Also, please let me know if I am overthinking things and the 965M is perfectly solid.

Thanks! </TEXT>
