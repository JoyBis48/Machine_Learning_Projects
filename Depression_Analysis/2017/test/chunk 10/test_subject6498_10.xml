	<TEXT> If you don't want to read Pippi Longstockings I can recommend Ronja Rvardotter or Brderna Lejonhjrta. They're not aimed at as young an audience as most of her other books. And are more in line with traditional fantasy genre.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> First post here. 

I enjoyed The Lost Symbol on a vacation 2009. Almost as much as The Da Vinci Code. But after having read almost 300 pages of Inferno, I just don't feel it. 

The mysteries and puzzles are nowhere to be seen, and it feels like the plot has been one big chase for a third of the book. (Run! Oh nice hiding place! Oh fuck, the police! Run! Oh nice hiding place! Etc.) 
The secondary character is pretty interesting but hasn't had that much of screen time. 


I just want to know. Is the book worth getting through? Does it get as good as the previous two books in the series, or close to it? Because as of now I just want to quit it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Soon (very soon) I'm going on a road trip through Europe. Our route is basically

Lbeck -
Stuttgart -
Milan -
Marseille -
Barcelona - 
Alicante

If we get tired of CD's and Spotify playlists it would be nice to have some old fashion FM radio to listen to. If you know any good Radio Stations avalible along this route. Please share.

Both music and talking (english speaking though) stations are appreciated. We are fans of rock, pop and metal of different kinds. 

If you got a favourite station that is not in English but plays good music you are free to share that too. 

Thanks </TEXT>

Once he has that power he will say that there is a dire need for everyone to take a good look at their representative local politicans and make sure they have voted in their best interest. If not. Find someone who has and support them instead.

If he wins. Things will change for the better for you. Mark my words. How much will change basically depends on the American people's political involvement. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't think you should throw this in a rural area where people can see the butt if you want to make use of the seed for a tree anyways? So that is kind of a moot point in this case. 

Of course littering has a psychological effect that just causes more of the same, but that is not really relevant with this tree cigarette since it goes to waste if it's thrown on asphalt and such. </TEXT>

I'm pretty sure that when media gets that the next president of the united states (touch wood) have mentioned Sweden as well as other Scandinavian countries as models for healthcare and education it's gonna flood our news.

We are mighty proud of our healthcare system. And we love to hear the praise of it.

	<TEXT> I'm sorry. That was a good comment you linked to. I didn't go that far back as to more than a *month back in time* But I still didn't see a post from you in this sub, and the few ones I saw on the subject of Bernie were strangely familiarly formulated not discussing any policy of his. Just broad key words like socialism, anti globalism, stagnated economy. Etc, etc. 

I didn't accuse you in that sense. It's just there has been A LOT of fresh accounts coming here trying to cool things down. And when you didn't answer my question if you think Bernie has got enough name recognition but instead talked about how neutral you are  I began suspecting something was wrong. And I waited a good while before I said something about it. 

I just thought that everyone agreed what Bernie's main concern is, is a certain other runner's name recognition that Bernie really lack. And found it weird you didn't think so. 

Not everyone needs to be a vocal supporter. I don't think that. 

I'm sorry if I offended you. I hope we can put our "pitchforks"  down and be civil. You seem like a good guy that stand up for what you believe. And hopefully we can end this discussion here on good terms because I really don't have time to do this anymore.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> First. I know there are Israeli communities that work. That's not relevant when talking about Bernie Sanders. So why you would bring it up to a hater is beyond me. And why you would hang out in a subreddit which very name is "Bernie for President" and not think he will win the general if he wins the primary. I'm not a campaign representative either. Heck. I won't even before for him. Because I can't. But Me and dare I say it everyone else are in this sub to promote good ideas on how to make Bernie the next president. And I don't feel you have done that at even a single time. 

And second. Your first response basically said that you think the name recognition Bernie Sanders is getting from msnc is plenty. And you think this viral campaign is "badly timed" 

I'm calling it. Call me a loony if you want. I think we got a Shill. A sneaky one at that. 

And that's all I got for this time folks. I don't have time for this anymore. But that's my opinion.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's great. I would love to be able to donate. But am neither allowed to nor have the spare money to do so sadly. 

And of course you should be open minded and I praise you for it. 
But I looked and you haven't written anything positive at all. Not that is perfectly clearly positive. 

And you even wrote in a thread about bernie in response to someone who don't think socialism works.... in /r/politics and I quote: "Actually. Socialism does work out well.....When applied on a small scale like the tiny communal villages in Israel." 


I know that YOU know that he isn't a absolute Socialist. And you explained that in a later post. But people won't always read every answer all the time. And I don't think that the first comment you made really benefit Bernie. Actually it is kind of a shitty comment to make if you advocate for Bernie because the American people don't know the difference between branches of socialism. 

And I think everyone here that wants more followers of bernie need to think about what they say in relation to him because not everyone know what he talks about. They might only know he's a Socialist and that is what we need to change. Correct me on that last statement of I'm wrong. And any other statement or assumption I made.

But I think my opinion is well founded, and I would love someone's opinion on that.

American students abroad, and foreign students in America will make this a global issue. I think Sweden can use a bit of the billionair talk. We abolished the inheritance tax some years ago..... And the new budget yesterday didn't mention the really wealthy... 

And I'm sure it's not just Sweden. UK got a real (real)  problem too.  Some insanely rich Swedes are actually moving to UK because of this.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> edit: So.  You think he get's enough name recognition? 

Just to end my curiosity. How come, every comment you previously made about bernie make about him or any of his policies come across as completely neutral but seems to point towards pre ww2 politics, anti globalism and other short general expressions?? There is no positive feedback. Only subtle resent as I take it. 

I'm just curious and you are free to explain this and we're done here. 

Because we have different opinions and mine is. 

The time to act, is now. Not later.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> EDIT: IMPORTANT  **Tl ; Dr** conchobarrmacness has no previous post  in /r/bernieforpresident.  and  we have a long and extremely boring discussion below. My opinion: I think he subtly speaks against bernie. That may be because that's just his way of expression. Or it might not be. Quotes below. 
two comments down he basically says this video campaign needs to go viral later,  not now because Bernie already got a lot of name recognition.  Correct me if I'm wrong.  (he never respond to why he said that, even though I ask him several times) 

On an ending note, after the "wow"  response. I'm positive. This needs to go viral asap.

End edit. 


A viral video can include something that puts another candidate in a different light than they are currently in. And it is achievable by just speaking the truth in good manners. Without saying anything negative about anyone. </TEXT>
