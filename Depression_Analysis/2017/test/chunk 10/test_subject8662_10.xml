	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm working towards being a screen writer and my father, not raised in the most enlightened of atmospheres, has said he thinks I should do a story about the challenges of a same sex couple raising a child of the opposite gender. I didn't think that would be that interesting as I didn't see that there would be that much difference from a regular couple; he thinks issues of sex and puberty would be more difficult to go over without a member of the opposite sex. What are your experiences? Is it that different from your heterosexual friends or is my dad completely off base? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Kev, First off thanks for all that you do, the pods and the flicks have been a huge influence on me.
Second, This is a tired ass question but very important to me right now so if you'll allow, I write screenplays with a partner and we're nearing completion on a few we're pretty satisfied with. I know you're all about the get a camera and do it yourself and we would love to but we don't have the money, time, equipment, or talent pool to draw from. If we're going the "old Hollywood route" what's our best bet for getting our stuff out there and maybe getting some representation/work? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Don't know where else to post this story so I'll try commiserating with yall. I ordered a year in time portrait for my mother On Dec 2nd from the website www.plowhearth.com/ after a little over a week I emailed, and received a response stating i had to allow 3 weeks, which was not stated anywhere on their site. After another week and a half I called and was routed to the shipping department (bad sign.) The shipping department said they would leave a message with Service and I would receive a callback tomorrow. This process repeated itself three more times up until today, where they said that it had shipped fedex direct and no tracking information was available. So my gift for my mother has yet to arrive with 30 hours to Christmas. Do not order from plow   hearth if you need your order inside of a month apparently. So reddit, what's your story?

No questions just, you're awesome.

Also I sent you an email like a year and a half ago that I later realized came off super creepy so... sorry about that.
