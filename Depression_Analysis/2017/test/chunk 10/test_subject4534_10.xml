	<TEXT> Yep still live with my parents. I'm from a small town and getting your own place is almost impossible. I also think it's cultural. I'm also a student so I live at home to qualify for student funding. I still have my own place when I'm at Uni but when the semester is out I'm back at my parents. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes. But I've learned to invite people to concerts I think they'll enjoy. Eric Church and FGL? My brother. Don Williams or Charlie Pride? My dad. Keith Urban or Brad Paisley? My friend who plays guitar.  Carrie Underwood or Miranda Lambert? A female friend. 

Most often they repay me by forcing me to go to concerts with them like Nicki Minaj or some metal show. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Classic country would be:

Hank Williams, Roger Miller, Kitty Wells and Patsy Cline.

Modern would be:

Kacey Musgraves, Kelsey Waldon, Lindi  Ortega and The Pistol Annie's (Ashley Monroe and Angaleena will also play their solo work). I would add First Aid Kit but I don't know if they would be country exactly. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah I was thinking of putting the 3G network back on so on the off chance it's switched on I'll get a notification.

Edit: hopefully they didn't pull the SIM card? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> iPad mini was stolen </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> My iPad mini 3 was stolen. I reported it stolen. Had the sim card suspended. I have Find My iPhone turned on and put it in Lost Mode. It has a lock screen. I have restrictions set so no one can make changes unless they know the password.

But since I found out it was stolen I've checked Find My iPhone and it's been offline. I've checked the notify me but so far, nothing. It's only been two days.

The thing is I'm not sure if they were able to restore it somehow. I usually customize the names of my devices but this iPad is just listed as 'iPad' which is odd. I might have forgotten to rename it when I reset everything a few months ago. I'm just wondering if there is any way possible they could have restored the iPad mini which could result in the name change and the offline status? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It seems traveling will be an issue then. My cat is fine with traveling now and seems to know what to expect. But if cats in general are not fine with traveling then I can't predict if the second cat will get used to it as well. 

I'm moving from a roommate situation to on my own. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've already listened to it a few times through already. I love it! I think it's quickly becoming my favourite of the year along with Randy Rogers and Wade Bowens recent release. Same Trailer, Different Park was good but I found I tired of the music. It sounded all the same. This seems to have more variety to the tracks. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> A second cat? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-06-23 20:23:44 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I have a 2 year old cat and I'm thinking of getting a second cat. I think my cat is lonely when I'm not home, he seems to sulk whenever I leave. I think he could use a companion. But I'm wondering if it's the right decision.

Some things I'm concerned about:

- I travel every few months to visit family either by 16 hour road trip or by flying. Traveling with two cats is doable but does complicate things. 
- I would be committing to another cat for his or her lifetime. Though a companion would be great for my cat, my cat doesn't have to worry about vet bills, moving, etc.
- I'm moving from a 3 level townhouse to a 2 bedroom apartment in a few months
- I'm starting College in the fall so the cats will be alone for a better part of the day, the pros are that my college will be across the street from my new apartment

Otherwise my cat isn't affectionate but does love humans and their presence as well as their attention. He's playful but not very creative. </TEXT>
