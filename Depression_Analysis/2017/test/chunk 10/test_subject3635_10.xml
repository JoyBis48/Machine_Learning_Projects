	<TEXT> Near Delhi University. I think it was Vijag Nagar. The name of the restaurant is "The Roast House". It's near the "Big Yellow Door"

It was a pretty good experience there.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I like the one in British council, but I doubt if this is the best Delhi has to offer.

I tried getting a membership of the Jwahar Lal memorial library, but was denied since they only allow people who are perusing PhD or something  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> I'm going to lose a chess game </TITLE>

	<TEXT> I often play online chess with a friend of mine who recently started playing. We play these long correspondence games where one gets ample time to move a piece. 

I don't know how but suddenly after 2 weeks the guy has improved tremendously. We are in the middle of a game right now and I'm probably going to lose my light squared bishop and it's just going to be very hard to recover from this.

Chess is the only thing I was good at. I've been playing for years and got a 1700-ish rating on some online websites and even won some online tournaments.

Man it's gonna hurt if I lose </TEXT>
