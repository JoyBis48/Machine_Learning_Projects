	<TEXT> The picture was ok but somewhere between my photos folder and uploading to imgur it just disappeared. I waited awhile for my phone to stop being a brat and reposted. Damn you technology! So mysterious, so powerful.. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's rough. My SO is similar in the sense that he tends to keep things totally inside his own head before he is absolutely certain of.. Whatever he needs to be certain about, like a solution or getting over the emotions or whatever it is. I've had to learn not to hound him even when I know something is wrong, and wait for him to talk when he is ready. Sometimes he doesn't talk and just feels better on his own and I have learned to accept that and just be a quiet support system.

If she doesn't want to talk about things, maybe she just needs a rock, a constant; the next best option is allowing yourself to that for her, even a distraction from her problems. Let her feel normal and not be focused on her problems. She knows you are there if she needs anything, she knows you love her and are there to talk and in the meantime just let her get it sorted in her head. 

Is there maybe some indirect way you can comfort her, maybe massages or a bath together or even something non-romantic like cook her a meal or bike riding or something you both enjoy? Maybe she would respond more openly if you could take the pressure off and just let her come to you if she decides she needs a shoulder to cry on. 

Also, just from my own personal experience; the worst thing you can do when someone if upset and doesn't want to talk about it is keep asking them to talk about it and not let them get over it on their own if that's what they want to do because it just makes everyone feel worse. And definitely don't put yourself down or get mad at yourself on her behalf, it's counterproductive and it will just make everyone more sad.

But my main advice is just try to be her rock this time; maybe she's not used to having that and just needs time to open up to it.
