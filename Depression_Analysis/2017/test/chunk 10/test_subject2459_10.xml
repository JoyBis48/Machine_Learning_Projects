	<TEXT> Nofap won't magically make you into a better (wo)man. You won't magically start to see girls queue up around you. Your muscles won't magically grow but nofap does give you the drive to make these things happen. It takes time and persistence but in the end you will be more confident (and clear headed) but only if you force yourself into certain situations.

You won't get a girl by sitting on reddit all day. Just go out into the world and meet people (I know, I know easier said than done but it's possible). And I know  it sounds cheesy but just be yourself. Girls must be sick to death of sex obsessed men who just want to get into their pants. Talk to them like you would anyone else and you might find that you really like her. Don't get down if you get rejected a few times.

You won't find going to the gym any easier (if you're new there) and it won't make lifting any lighter but it might give you an extra drive (and a way to get all of your energy out without fapping) and it will make you feel better afterwards. 

So go outside (even if it's just for a walk, make yourself walk for one or two hours everyday) and you might be all the better for it. Learn to cook there are quite literally millions of videos on youtube! Start drawing, if all you can do is stick figures, who cares keep going (every master was once a begginer). Learn a language, play and instrument, volunteer! There's so much ***you*** could be doing right now, so go and start. 

Nofap is about persistence and patience and hard work and it won't pay off unless you make it. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm not going to write a review of any kind, I'm just going to talk a bit about this book.

I'm really into history, I've read and studied for hours on end about all sorts of things. I spent a long time studying the time periods between 1850-present (although I love ancient history and, well any history really). I heard for years that I should read: "All Quiet on the Western Front" but I always put it off because I was reading sonething else. I finally got round to it. 

When people talk sbout Germany the topic always seem to turn to Hitler and often people are severely under-educated on the subject matter. I really feel sympathetic for the German people of today. They don't feel pride for their country because of what happened.  


Anyway, the book focuses on a group of German soldiers during the first world war and it really captures the essence of innocence lost. Even though the book is a work of fiction it tugs at the hearts strings because to many people went through these situations. It shows that the German troops were just as annoyed about the war as the allied countries. 

It also captures the feeling of camaraderie that was the high point of life in the trenches, like I said this is not a review but I do feel like anyone interested  in war, history or simply looking for their next read should pick up this book.

	<TEXT> So I walked in on my brother, let's say, jerkin the gerkin'. I immeadiately closed the door but he was obviously embarassed which reminded me one (of the many reasons) that I'm abstaining from fapping. 

The embarassment on his face showed me how shamed he was. People talk about it like it's normal and healthy and that "everyone does it" but if these were true then why do people get so embarassed when the subject matter comes up?

I'm writing this cause I've seen a ton of posts recently about people who are edging. So if you consider it try and get it off of your mind and if you start think about the pain you'll feel if you continue. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 'How you holding up?' Asked my mum as we arrived home from my best friends funeral, she died in a car crash just over a week ago

I look at her and she can tell I'm hurting:

'I'm, ok. I'm just gonna go up to bed'.

She leaves me as I retreat to my place of solace. I lie in bed and think about all the stuff we did together, we were friends practically since birth. Her name was Liara and she was only sixteen! 

I fall asleep and dream about my recently deceased pal.

Bleep.

I hear the familiar sound alerting me that I've just recieved a text message. I take my phone and stare in horror, the screen reads:

"1 unread message from Liara"

A million and one thoughts rush through my mind and I finally decide to open it, it simply reads:

'Hey'

I immediately respond:

'Who is this?'

Bleep

'It's me, Liara, wanna do something later'

I reply straight away

'I don't know who's doing this but it's not funny, have some god damn respect for the dead' send.

A tear fills my eye.

Bleep.

'What do you mean respect for the dead? Are you feeling ok?'

The text message makes me want to punch something, someone is using my best friend, my dead best friend's phone to taunt me!

'I don't care who you are, just stop. It's not funny!'

The phone rings after I send the last text. Caller ID says it's liara. I answer it and practically scream the words:

'Fucking stoo it, Liara was buried less than two hours ago, don't you have any fucking respect!!'

'What are you talking about, I'm right here' replies the person on the end of the phone... Liara.

'Wh-what?! How. We, we burie-' I reply in shock

'I don't know why you're acting so weird, I'm fine, it must've been a nightmare'

I convince myself she's right but I'm still shaking from the shock. Then she says something, something Liara would never say...







I would continue but I have to go, nice writing prompt though. </TEXT>

"I love you pewds you're so funny!!! :D :D D"

	<TITLE> A creepy old man in a cold room in a nightmare in an old house [UPDATE] </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-07-19 21:53:22 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So here is what I wrote in the original post

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 

When I was a kid my family and I moved to the countryside. For the first four years we lived in a small town which was fine but we eventually moved, quite litterally to the middle of nowhere. It was this one street town with like 4 houses. It was ok because I spent most of my time indoors anyway (I've always been indoors-ey). The house we were living in was big, much bigger than anything I had ever stayed in before (before we moved to the countryside we lived in a suburban area of a city with a pretty big home, then a small town, then the middle of nowhere). Most of the bedrooms were upstairs but there was one down stairs. Everytime you went in it it was cold, when I say cold I mean it felt like ice, you could always see your breath. So, as a rule, I stayed out of there. The rest of the house was awesome and my brothers and sisters and I had a pretty cool time living there but I started getting horrible feelings whenever I went near the cold room: My eyes would water like I was going to cry, I would get a sore chest. I always tried to keep myself calm by explaining to myself that it was just me, I got a sore chest because of my asthma, I had watery eyes because of some other reason I'm sure I found less than convincing. The part that gets creepy was when our kitchen was being remodeled. Because of the layout of the kitchen we had to move the fridge into the cold bedroom untill the remodelling was finished. I couldn't stand going in there and eventually I straight out refused. You see I spend a lot of time with my two dogs (who were younger at the time) since I'm almost always inside and whenever they went near that room they would show their teeth and raise their hackles, which they virtually never do. One night I fell asleep and had this nightmare. In it I went into the room to get something as fast as I possibly could but then the door slammed shut and I couldn't open it for the life of me. On the other side my brother was trying to force it open. Then this man appeared he was clothed in a huge black cloak and started mumbling words I couldn't make out before he started choking me. I woke up coughing like mad and had, what I call, a "mini" asthma attack. I told my mum the next morning and she starred as if looking through me not at me. Then she said: 'XboxG4mer I had the exact same dream' She never wanted to freak me out so straight away she comforted me by telling me it was just a dream. I kept having the same nightmare and I never asked her but I think my mum did too because after a couple of months we moved away. The man in the dream was old but looked wholly evil. I don't know what happened in that house but there was something about that room. Nothing could warm it and the eery sensations I got when near it were stronger than any I've ever felt.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 

UPDATE:



So I spoke with my mum about the house. She said she felt the same (she has gone through quite a lot as far as paranormal sightings go) by that I mean she has seen her fair shair of... whatever you want to call them. She said in her dream it was her being choked and she woke up in a state of sleep paralysis. When she managed to get back to sleep she had the dream again but this time I was in the room and she was trying to get in. 

The house was built around one hundred years ago. The village used to be pretty popular, it had a mining tunnel, a school, a bar, train station and more but when we lived there it was dead.

I should also mention that it was pretty foggy in my mums mind. When I brought it up she remembered it but it was lime she hadn't thought about it in a long time. </TEXT>

Nofap is a nice thing because it helps motivate but make sure to take initiative and make things happen for yourself. As far as hair loss goes I can't really help I fortunately have long hair but I've read that it helps a lot of people. Good luck!! </TEXT>
