	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I started this book after Sanderson doing a great job of finishing the wheel of time series.  To be honest I expected something very similar to the Wheel of Time books in this book. Instead I found a very intriguing world that was slowly built up. There was a lack of "action" but i always found myself interested in where the story was taking me and as clues fell into place I started to piece together the larger story. I'm very interested to see where the 2nd book goes from here and if develops in the same way. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Inivisible Man by Ralph Ellison. Read during High School at a point in time where I did not have a lot of confidence and was struggling with my identity... I'll always love the quote:

"And my problem was that I always tried to go in everyones way but my own. I have also been called one thing and then another while no one really wished to hear what I called myself. So after years of trying to adopt the opinions of others I finally rebelled. I am an invisible man" </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Recently I played a game as support Skywrath. http://www.dotabuff.com/matches/1596931228

At the end of the game I have Eul's, Force Staff, Scythe of Vyse, soul ring, Tranquil Boots, and Agh's. This was a hour long game but I feel like i have too many items. I placed at least 8 wards during the game since that was my compendium challenge, I know had some sentries for a while that i was using to secure vision in certain areas like near Rosh. I pulled some camps during the start of the game..I just feel like I didnt buy enough sentries or was missing something i should have been doing.

I bought my items for the following reasons:
soul ring + tranquils: allows me to harass in lane a lot while keeping mana up

eul's: my idea was to hopefully eul's the sk while he was channelling epi or keep me to safe to allow my cooldowns to come back up

force: maneuverability/safety for carries

scythe: the enemy team had a storm that was carrying..wanted to use my silence + scythe to focus him down

aghs: late game had 4k gold just chilling there </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I've been watching a couple streams including HR's recent dotapit match against C9 where they picked Huskar. Huskar is part of my Compendium 10 hero challenge so I was particularly interested in this match. Thoroughout the match the commentators frequently commented about how good Huskar's "Armlet Toggling" was. From context clue's I figured it has to do with the active of Armlet but what is it? Why is it good? How should Huskar correctly use it? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> as long as you have just black coffee you should be fine..if you add sugar and creamers then you just need to account for those calories over time...

as for what your eating...i would guess that you are probably not eating "too few" calories as most people underestimate calories they are eating especially when it comes to snacks. 

but here's real talk..are you taking pictures of yourself every 30 days? Are you taking measurements(ie waste size, bicep size) every 30 days? If all you're doing is looking at the scale you may "see the results" but you will be getting them.

If i recall correctly I had a maybe 5-10lb change after the whole 90 days..but my body looked significantly different

	<TEXT> Hi! I play League as well(Silver 4 noob) and will try to address some of your questions.

* playing support is one of the most knowledged based roles in dota2. Similar to how in league you need to know how to ward/keep dragon nashor timers/keep flash timers/level 2 rush there is a lot to know in dota2(smoke, dust, sentries, ward positions, jungle pulls). I would avoid playing hard support until you get a little more familiarity with the game

* Similar to LoL, bots is useful for playing a hero for the first time and figuring out how that hero works. If you go against a hero and are having a hard time play that hero in a bot game to figure out his skills

* if you are having a hard time with builds dota has an answer for that once you enter the game [click the book in the upper left hand corner](http://i.ytimg.com/vi/l0k2TUvkc4E/maxresdefault.jpg). this will provide you with a selection of the highest recommended builds which usually have item progressions as well as explanations for that item. Also it even highlights the ability it suggests you learn at each level

hopefully some of these tips will help you out :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> not sure it's a big issue but I would work on having a solid foundation when unracking the weight. On a squat get into a squat position under the bar and then lift to make sure you are in good position...same with OHP, get into that front rack position like a front squat and then use legs to lift weight out of rack

squat: crank your elbows down a bit, this is going to help you keep your frame upright. on a couple reps(especially the last one) it appeared like the weight got forward of you and you were doing a good morning </TEXT>

I've also done SS, ICF, and then have done crossfit for 2 years. What I've found is that whatever motivates you to get into the gym/workout consistently is what's the "best" and gets you the best results.

If you want to try to do p90x and money is no issue I would HIGHLY suggest doing the p90x/Insanity hyrbid plan to get most results quickly </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You replied to me in 2 places but i'll condense my reply here :). While I agree for heroes the 96k number looks good the question is "Is it a good number for ESPN2?" ESPN2 averaged 212k viewers on Sunday and a 30for30 repeat last week in the same time spot averaged 300k+ viewers. I'm just not sure if the 96k makes ESPN2 more likely to show another Heroes event. If that entire 96k is in the 18-35 demo then it might be a win for ESPN2 based on how highly they covet that demo

	<TEXT> bad idea to get a PhD in computer science unless you are wanting to be a professor. In computer science the amount your paid is usually directly related to your real world experience coding. You would benefit better from starting to learn some type of programming on your own(ie create a github project where you develop an android app, create a video game using the newly free Unreal Engine 4,etc)
