Sort of silly, but it's such a perfect illustration of the bulk of anti-GMO folks. "I fundamentally lack understanding of modern agriculture and genetics, but I'm against it." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No, the camera was outside a styrofoam cooler. The more important parts were inside with a hand warmer. Even still, it got to -10C inside the cooler. Without the insulation, and the fact that chemical handwarmers will not work at altitude (they require oxygen), it wouldn't stand a chance. Though it might have given us a few thousand more feet.

Things to engineer for next time! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Our primary tracking system used a [TK-102 GPS/GSM tracker](http://www.ebay.com/itm/like/161578074970?lpid=82 chn=ps). It works by texting GPS coordinates when pinged. Although, there is no cell reception above 15-20,000 feet, so for most of the flight we were in the dark.

It landed in a soybean field a little east of Stoughton. It was very close to out predicted landing.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> On Monday a small student group in the physics department sent up a helium high altitude balloon. This is one photo we recovered. It's a little blurry because the payload is nowhere near stable.

This photo is from about 20,000 feet. The camera continued to collect images until the battery froze at about 33,000 feet. The balloon continued to 95,000 feet (18 miles!) before the balloon burst. Total flight time of about 2.5 hours. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The ice only exists in certain regions, but the atmosphere mixes easily and is remarkably uniform for the size. It takes just about a year for, say, the molecules in a liter of gas in one place today to become evenly distributed around the globe. This has been measured with stable heavy isotopes and various nuclear disasters/explosions.

The ice has a resolution of about one year, since the snow fall that traps the gas pockets happens on a yearly cycle. It is a great and reasonably high resolution way to estimate global CO2 levels for the last 800,000 years (Maximum so far achieved for the EPICA program.) Sea sediments can go back as far as 200 million years with lower resolution than ice cores.

So how is it irrelevant? Facts are relevant to science and this is a fact. CO2 levels are higher now than ever in the last million years. There's good confidence to say that and a mountain of supporting evidence with well defined error bars. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Different carcinogens expose you to more risk than others. In this case, glyphosate was put into group 2A, a [list is available on wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_IARC_Group_2A_carcinogens). 

Other things on that list are long-term exposure to frying foods, working a night shift, hot mate, and UV light. There is also at least one antibiotic and one chemo drug.

So protect yourself, and most farmers know that. Life is a game of relative risks. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [clue] Constellation Cassiopeia in the Funny Pages </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> The fifth panel of the first comic in the funny pages shows to two people on the moon. In the background, the stars appear to show the constellation Cassiopeia.

This might be a coincidence, but it looks uncannily similar. I googled "Love cassiopeia" without anything that looks relevent. The photo for "cassiopeia" is 192, a stone stairway.

Edit: [photo](http://i.imgur.com/FxRtKF3.png) I had to rotate the image from my astronomy program so the star names are upsidedown. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The slap .45 logo has lines around it. Most lines (not all) can be translated as Morse code. Some can be translated in either direction (away or towards the "Slap .45" text).

[photo](http://www.imgur.com/23RAUzk)

My translation yielded:

MOKMNGNCNANUNKKCCKQKC

OR:

MOKMAAWKANANUNKKCCKQKC

Neither may be correct, since some can be broken into two letters. Neither sequence makes any sense in Ceaser decoding. Hope this helps! </TEXT>
