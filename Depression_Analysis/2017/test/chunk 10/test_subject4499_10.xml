	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Just finished watching The Hunt, and while I thought it was a fantastic film, I need to know, who the fuck shot at Loucas? Are we to assume what happened to him will follow him indefinitely? Or am I a blundering idiot who missed a giant part of the plot somehow?

Thanks in advance! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So, I am a creature living in the sewers of the audiophile world. I am a father of two small children, so therefore my budget is fairly limited. Today my Onkyo TX-NR609 amplifier ceased to exist. It was nothing fancy, but it did the trick. I would game/movie watch/listen to tunes through it VIA xbox/xbox 360/xbox one/PS3 (media server). So all I would like to know, is what would be a decent replacement for the amplifier? This is assuming my speakers/sub are still operational. I'd like to stay around $500.00 CAD. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I had a dream the other night where I was back in a department store in my home town where my mom would take me shopping for back to school clothing. The place was so dimly lit and eerie. As I was walking through I felt like I wasn't me, and I somehow hijacked someone else's body as I roamed around. I ended up bumping into 9 year old me trying on baseball hats in the mirror and it freaked me out. I like to believe that I had time travelled in my sleep, and that frightens me.

EDIT: redundancies. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks for the input. This is my first time really messing around with audacity and/or recording anything at all really. But I think you're right, that as long as it's listenable we shouldn't worry about quality too much. Also, I'm not aiming for professional studio quality, I just want everyone's levels to be somewhat similar. When I listen to it driving I noticed the internet streamed voices were a bit of an ear assault. 

I'm scared of the effects menus, they're scary and it makes me frightened. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As some of you may know, /u/Jafvalla and I are conducting an interview themed podcast of sorts. We are beginners, busting our way through an age old established formula. As anyone could have guessed, we are running into a few production/quality issues.

I've managed to figure out how to record a stereo mix of the audio through google hangouts, however with that, everyone's sound quality suffers slightly. 

If anyone with audio/recording experience could give suggestions, we would be greatly appreciative. My questions are as follows:

 * How can one record their own voice in addition to a stereo mix of what's coming from the internet? (When I attempt to open two audacity windows and alter "stereo mix" to my microphone, it automatically switches to the same recording settings in the second window).

 *  If all parties involved record their own voices, how does one match them up simultaneously/ seamlessly? Is some sort of queue required at the beginning like a [clapperboard](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clapperboard)? That to me seems to be the only way, but I have no idea what I'm talking about.

 * If a stereo mix of audio is recorded from my station, where my voice will be crystal clear, and others may sound "tinny" or louder than mine, what is the best way to equalize the audio?
