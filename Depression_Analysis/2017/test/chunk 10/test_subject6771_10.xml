	<TEXT> Thank you adamkovicsnipple for your submission! Unfortunately, your post has been removed for the following reason(s):

***It breaks rule 1:*** **Use the correct title formatting.** Titles should be to the point, and all extra information or context should be added in the comments. 

Here is how you should format it - 

Your artwork - "Title, Medium, Size" 


Also remember no extraneous information in the title means do not state that it's your first time using a medium in the title, or write 'Hey Reddit', 'What do you think?' 'A ____ I did' or any variation or be subjective in the title ("awesome work," "amazing piece" etc). Also do not mention your 'cake day' or use karma-bait titles.

what properties do you manage or own? 


 bitch and moan- GO. STAY AWAY. Stop breathing my air.


what a fucking dick. you should respect the opinions of others. 


 What I do hate about our system are those fucking machines. Having to stoop down to use an awful UI that takes minutes instead of seconds. And then having to go BACK and put the slip on the dash. 


tells us not to bitch.....then goes on to bitch. yah okay buddy.  </TEXT>

***It breaks rule 1:*** **Use the correct title formatting.** Titles should be to the point, and all extra information or context should be added in the comments. 

Here is how you should format it - 

Your artwork - "Title, Medium, Size" 


Also remember no extraneous information in the title means do not state that it's your first time using a medium in the title, or write 'Hey Reddit', 'What do you think?' 'A ____ I did' or any variation or be subjective in the title ("awesome work," "amazing piece" etc). Also do not mention your 'cake day' or use karma-bait titles.

	<TEXT> def not a combative thing to ask but you've been on the defensive since you showed up to "pile on". **it's fine.** **it's okay.** there are other subs on reddit that i can post this to (and I have already) and def other places on the internet. reddit is not the *friendly* bastion it wants to perpetuate to the masses. 


god forbid, moderators actually do their job of moderating and *actually moderate.* so what if you had to remove some ugly comments. Guess what: You. just. did. your. job. instead of coming on the scene in the defensive manner as in you did. I'm not even a freaking troll but you treat me as if I'm a cancer upon your fine subreddit. Don't worry I'm not even fighting the removal at this point meaning you do not have to comment back b/c I'm done with this. the other mod did great, you did not. suggesting that i only shared the question to start drama is why i'm mad. and if you could think of another way of stating it in a less combative wording then why didn't you do so already.  </TEXT>

that was teeth gritting. like i said, "i don't want the average redditor to know the personal details of my life". i don't think i'll choose to participate. "we" as moderators sometimes are caught in between a hard place and a rock when upholding the rules of the subs we govern and i understand this and this is just one of those very rare times. thank you for your time and have a good weekend.  </TEXT>
