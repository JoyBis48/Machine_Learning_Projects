	<TEXT> My book backlog is beyond ridiculous. I find that my main problem is that while I'm reading, sitting in silence actually hurts my concentration. Of course, a lot of the music I've tried tends to be rather distracting (or at the very least, doesn't fit the mood). What are your thoughts? Any recommendations? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sci Fi- the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. It's easily my favorite book of all time (the first sequel as well, the rest kinda got away from me) and outside of Foundation, a good candidate for greatest Science Fiction novel. 

That being said, the Foundation books are probably also on there. I can't say for certain, I've never actually finished them (sorry)

Superhero/Graphic Novel- Watchmen. Fuckin'... duh. 

Though as for graphic novels, I would also like to give a shoutout to the Neon Genesis Evangelion manga, if only because I love NGE, and the graphic novel is pretty spectacular.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is Wall Street

Back together

And I'll never have a recession at the hands of the stock market because we're doing much better

And the economy is saying "go get her"

The Upper Class ain't gonna follow your rules

Come at me without any of your commie fools

Let's go, just me and you

Let's go, my profits grew

Go ahead and overthrow me if you're able

Can't you see that the economy is stable

I can see you hate the way we trade under the table

But you're just mad your revolution's been disabled </TEXT>

	<TEXT> According to Bruce Campbell, Evil Dead 2 actually is a sequel in the traditional sense. They couldn't get the rights to their own movie, so instead they made the first part of the movie a sort of modified recap of the first movie. If you took the end of ED1 (when Ash gets hit in the face with the first-person thing) and put it in ED2 when he gets hit again, you'd have the proper continuity.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It starts out with bands like One Direction to catch the defener crowd, but by the end of the show they're delving into more loved classic bands like the Beatles. "But /u/test_subject8582," I hear you asking "Surely there are people who would be perfectly accepting of the Beatles' songs 24/7. Many people probably already do that." So my solution: start off with their good stuff (first couple days alternate between Lucy in the Sky, Sgt Pepper, etc.) but as people refuse to leave, slowly start replacing songs with their worse songs (Swap out Yellow Submarine in the rotation for Octopus' Garden for example). By the season finale, we have people listening exclusively to Yoko Ono's contributions.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's not as cerebral as some of the stuff you have listed, but Hideaki Anno's directorial debut, Gunbuster, has some existential themes. It's also badass as fuck and i reccomend it as a knee jerk reaction to just about anything. 

Ghost In the Shell (the original movie, and to a lesser extent the show) fits what you're looking for pretty nicely.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The only thing I could think of would be to find your own 1-2 inch Squid Girl figure and just replace the Inkling girl. If you did this, you'd probably also have to paint the ink on the base Ika's shade of blue.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There's no real *counter*evidence to the order being Rebuild then NGE, but there's almost no evidence in favor of that theory. NGE then Rebuild, on the other hand, has loads of evidence to suggest that it directly follows NGE in the grand timeline. Kaworu's dialogue in both his cameos in 1.11 and 2.22 as well as a couple lines in 3.33 imply that he's been through this before, while episode 24 has no such implications. Even a bunch of the Angels (notably Ramiel) are more powerful than they had been before. Combined with the red sea and potential Mass-Production Evangelion (from End of Evangelion) outline on the hill in the opening of 1.11, there's really not a lot to say that Rebuild isn't a sequel to something, assuming you buy into Time Loop theory at all, that is. 

Really, we'll probably end up getting confirmation one way or the other when 3.0+1.0 comes out.  </TEXT>
