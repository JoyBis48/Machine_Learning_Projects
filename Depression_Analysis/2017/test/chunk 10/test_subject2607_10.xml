	<TEXT> I'm an indie and alternative rock girl, and although I usually don't admit it, I also know how to rock out to Kanye, Childish Gambino, Kendrick Lamar, and Frank Ocean.

I'm a very shy and quiet person, but in my first hour Spanish class, I talk a lot and make a lot of jokes, even though I don't have any friends in that class. No idea why I'm so comfortable in that class. Maybe it's the teacher.

I'm a band student, and most students have that "band kids are great we stick together" mentality, but I think a lot of band kids are really annoying and have huge egos and are sort of douche bags. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Kind of. Loved this dude to no end, then we broke up. And he straight up told me he doesn't like me as more than a friend anymore after about a year of us still having feelings after we broke up. Now he's talking to me less and less and obviously trying to get away from me and it breaks my heart because I can feel him slipping away and I can't handle that. As melodramatic as it sounds I've been flirting a lot with other guys lately, because I figure that if I give myself to guys that don't matter then I'll forget the only one that does. My friends hate him, his friends hate me. We fought a lot and at one point this summer he was being such a dick to me that I told him I was done and I wasn't gonna talk to him anymore. That lasted about a week. Then I smoked weed once in like, September after I promised him I wouldn't (he's really against drugs and alcohol), and then texted him high off my ass. Basically after a spell of us being really good with each other, I broke it and he said "I broke the best bond we've ever had with each other." Then he ran off and his friends found him at the smoke shop because "if she's gonna stoop that low then so am I." And nothing has been the same since then. I love this guy to no end, he's the only thing I ever think about, and he's pushing me away, and I think about it and it just makes my entire body hurt because I know it's completely over and won't happen again. Sorry for the wall of text, but I started typing and it felt good to let it out. </TEXT>

My other friend who always asks for nudes and who I always say no to because I don't do that decided that he doesn't want to be my friend if I won't send him nudes. So, it was a day. But at least I aced my Spanish test. That was cool. </TEXT>

About 2 years from now you'll accidentally come across a boy who breaks your heart over and over again and you still care about him. He cycle started because you were the first to let him go. Don't do that. It will be tough, but stick with him because he's worth it. Stay motivated in school, because in 3 years you'll be in your AP classes regretting the times you could barely pass 8th grade math because you were lazy. Just look to the future and keep your goals in mind. Tell Mom you love her. Hang in there. It gets easier."

	<TEXT> I live in Michigan, which is a state that requires the ACT, and very few people take the SAT. I'm trying really hard to get into UMich, and I'm wondering if taking the SAT would look good, and if it would make it seem like I'm motivated and diligent. To take the SAT here, it costs money and isn't required or even necessarily encouraged at my school, so I assume that most of the applicants only take the ACT. Would it be to my advantage to take both, or is it more trouble than it's worth? </TEXT>
