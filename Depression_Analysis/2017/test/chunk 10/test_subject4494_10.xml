	<TEXT>  I state you haven't learned anything new, because before waking up, according to the game, you know with 100% certainty that you WILL wake up, and you do.

That's not what you said above; you said the probability was either 100% or 200%. If in the analogous case where you wake up 1% of the time waking does tell you something new, and you're using the exact same model but in reverse in the 200% case, why don't you accept that waking tells you something new as well?

IE; if I played the game, I would know, well before going to bed, and long after, that the probability is, was, and forever shall be, 1/3, upon my waking.

How does that statement imply anything about whether waking is new information? You could make a similar statement about anything you update on that "after it happens, you know the probability in advance".

I think you're confused about what those words mean. If we condition on X happening, and that causes us to change our probabilities, then observing X is teaching us something. How do you simultaneously say that we're updating on something, yet then turn around and say that it's not actually teaching us anything?

Now let's change the probabliities.
If heads, the doctor will visit you 100% of the time.
If tails, the doctor will visit you 200% of the time.

I said pretty much this somewhere else in this thread, although I'm a tiny bit uncomfortable with probabilities greater than 1, and would prefer some model that does the same but without those probabilities. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Because Beauty cannot differentiate between what scenario she is in, she cannot use that to inform her decision on whether or not heads was rolled.

That doesn't follow. Just because she can't know for sure which scenario she's in doesn't mean she doesn't know anything at all about it. It's probabilistic knowledge, like I said.

I'm not sure what you mean. She knows a coin was flipped, and she knows that a heads flip means one awakening while a tails flip means a million awakenings. Except none of that matters because Sleeping Beauty cannot ever, in the course of the experiment, know she has been awakened any more times than one (because each time she is put back to sleep, she forgets having been wakened) and because she knows that she is awakened at least once in either scenario. In other words, Beauty acquires no new knowledge in either scenario.

The new knowledge is that she woke up *today*. That has a different prior probability depending on whether it was head or tails. If it was heads, then half of the days she won't wake up at all. If it was tails, then she wakes up every day. So P(awake|tails)=P(awake|heads)*2, and a Bayesian update on awake changes the probabilities. She doesn't need to know that she'd been awakened multiple times; the fact that she was awakened once is what she'd updating on. Yes, this would happen at least once either way, but the fact that it happens more than once in some cases is evidence for those cases.

That's probably not too convincing, so let me frame this differently.

Before she goes to sleep, there are 4 possibilities for the future, all equally likely. H/Mon, H/Tue, T/Mon, and T/Tue. True, she'll never see H/Tue, but it's still there. As soon as she awakens, she finds out that it isn't H/Tue, so now there are only 3 cases, all with equal probability.

Or like this:

If instead of being awoken 2 times on T, she's awoken less than 1 times, e.g. .5 times by flipping another coin after tails on Tuesday and waking on one outcome, then the Bayesian update is straightforward and it changes the probabilities. As the number of times increases towards one, the update becomes smaller and smaller, until at 1 it's nothing. I claim that when the number goes above 1, we should do the same update as when it's under 1.

I don't see why that matter. Yes, it's a single update (possibly done multiple times), but why does that make it invalid?

When she wakes, she knows she is in the experiment--but she also knows that she cannot know which scenario she is in.

	<TEXT> If you agree with that, then it should be trivial to work backwards to the thirder position.

We want to know P(T|B). We can decompose this into P(T|B, Monday) and P(T|B, Tuesday), and add them together after multiplying by P(Monday|B) and P(Tuesday|B) respectively, since they're mutually exclusive and exhaustive

P(T|B, Monday)=P(B, Monday|T)P(T)/P(B, Monday) 

=P(B, Monday|T)(1/2)/P(B, Monday) 

P(B, Monday) is equal to P(Monday|B)*P(B), which is 1/2.

So those cancel out above, leaving P(B, Monday|T) equal to P(T|B, Monday)

P(B, Monday|T) is easily seen to be 1/2, so P(T|B, Monday) is too.

P(T|B, Tuesday) is obviously 1.

So P(T|B)=P(Monday|B)P(T|B, Monday)+P(Tuesday|B)P(T|B, Tuesday)

=(2/3)(1/2)+(1/3)(1)=**2/3**. (The 1/3 for P(Tuesday|B) is 1 - the 2/3s for P(Monday|B), since they're exhaustive)


By the way, you can remove all of the |Bs from this to make it simpler, and just take it as background. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  But I'm not seeing how this tracks back to the original problem. In the original problem, you wake her no matter what you flip. Being awake is therefore not itself evidence for any particular outcome. Thus, since she has no information she did not have when she went to sleep, her answer should not change--the probability of your flipping (or now having flipped) heads remains 1/2.

That's a fair argument. Let me quote from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleeping_Beauty_problem#Halfer_position

	<TEXT>  It does not matter how many times you ask the question -- the probability is always still 1/2.

This is trivially false. If I ask the question 0 times on tails, then the probability of the coin being heads, given that SB was asked the question, is ~1. If I ask the question .5 times (meaning I ask only half of the times that I get tails), then the probability of heads also clearly goes up, because being asked the question is Bayesian evidence for heads. So if I'm asked the question 2 times, shouldn't we be doing the same calculation? </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  But yeah, I'm pretty much in agreement with what someone else here said - we're all arguing semantics.

It could be much of the argument here is semantics, but the actual SB argument isn't. There are several differing views that I don't think can be put down to semantics (see the various views on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleeping_Beauty_problem for the kinds of arguments I'm refering to).

As phrased in the video, the answer to the question, "what's the probability the coin came up heads," is 1/2. If we're talking about the probability of SB guessing correctly, if she's asked each time she's woken up, the probability is 1/3 that she would be correct in guessing that heads was flipped.

There's a third question; what is her subjective probability that the coin was heads? The halfers and thirders disagree on that exact question, no semantics involved.

Maybe read through https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-indication_assumption and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-sampling_assumption, and you'll agree that it belongs in philosophy and isn't solely about semantics.

(Also see http://lesswrong.com/lw/oj/probability_is_in_the_mind/ and http://lesswrong.com/lw/s6/probability_is_subjectively_objective/, which might help clear up some confusion).

Like, if they got tails, they wake her up on monday, ask her which she thinks it is, then wake her up on tuesday and ask her what she thinks it is?

Yes, and they wipe her mind in between so she doesn't remember being asked.

Let me restate the problem, because you asked:

SB is put to sleep. A coin is flipped. If it is heads, SB is woken up on Monday, asked what she thinks the coin was, then put to sleep forever. If it is tails, SB is woken up on Monday, asked what she thinks the coin was, then put to sleep. We then give her some memory pill so that she is reset to the state she was in at the beginning of Monday. On Tuesday, we wake her up again, asked her what she thinks the coin was, then put her to sleep forever. 

See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleeping_Beauty_problem for more.

There's the probability of h v t

If you want to know the probability from the subjective view of someone not in the experiment, then yes, it's 50/50. We're talking about her subjective probability expectation, which is allowed to be different. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  She is not asked what is the probability of saying heads will be correct, she is asked the probability the coin landed heads.

And the answer is necessarily subjective, because it's a probability. See [this article](http://lesswrong.com/lw/oj/probability_is_in_the_mind/) and perhaps [this wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_interpretations#Subjectivism) if you want to understand the subjective claim better.

If by probability you mean what that last page calls "physical probability" (which you seem to), then yes, nobody disputes that. We're talking about the subjective expectation of SB. Bayesian updating works on subjective expectations.

Bayes theorem is hard probability and math, so applying it to "subjective confidence" is not very useful.

You misunderstand at least one of these concepts. Could you explain what you *do* think Bayesian updating is, with some toy example? What is being updated, if not subjective confidence?

Your counter example does though have conditionals, the conditional that she has evidence of the toss. The SB problem is not set up as such. she has literally no new evidence, all she knows is she has awoken.

That's exactly what she learns, though; that she has awoken. That has different probabilities in the two different worlds. To be sure, the probability that she awakens *at least once* is equal; but the probability that she awakens is twice as much in a tails world than a heads one.

If you concede that her probability of waking is different in each world, i.e. P(awake|H)!=P(awake|T), then she can't think it's 50/50 anymore. If you're fine with an example where P(awake|H) is 1 and P(awake|T) is .01, then you already agree with that. So your complaint is that P(awake|T) is 1 and equal to P(awake|H). My claim is that P(awake|T)=2 if she awakens twice.

Getting back to my example above, if you are correct and P(awake|T)=1, then P(T|awake,Monday) (she is told that it's Monday) must be (by Bayes)

P(T|awake,Monday)=P(awake,Monday|T)P(T)/P(awake,Monday)

=P(awake,Monday|T)(.5)/P(awake,Monday)

Now, P(awake,Monday) should equal P(Monday), and that's 3/4 under your theory (1*.5 for H, and .5*.5 for T)

so

P(T|awake,Monday)=P(awake,Monday|T)(.5)/(3/4)

Now, P(awake,Monday|T) should be 1/2, so plugging that in

P(T|awake,Monday)=(1/2)(1/2)/(3/4)=**1/3**

This means that learning that it's Monday causes SB to think that the coin was tails only 33% of the time, and is a direct consequence of your view.

Now, if I modify the problem so that she *only* gets woken up on Monday, then presumably her probability of tails is now 50%. You need to explain why the *possibility* of her awakening on Tuesday affects her probability estimates, even though she knows that it didn't happen. What causality can there be there?

Your example simply institutes a test which is completely solvable, and therefore a tautology. P(X|X) is always 100% and isn't seemingly a very useful insight.

I'm trying to motivate a model where the likelihood of her awakening matters. If it matters for sub-1 probabilities, then it should matter for over-1 as well. Those might not be standard probabilities, but they do seem to work. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Me saying heads 100 percent of the time does not imply that the probability of a tails event occurring is absolute, just that it is the only thing I will observe.

We're not talking about some abstract property of the coin, called "probability". We're talking about what she will observe, if she goes and checks the coin.

If I only show you the coin when it lands on heads, then my telling you that I'm about to show you the coin is evidence which causes you to update your probability to ~1 of heads. Yes, the prior probability remains unchanged, priors never change (barring updates to prior selection policy, but let's ignore that). The posterior does change on new information.

 Finally for Bayesian updating to be relevant at all, SB would need some information to condition her expected probability on. The problem is set up so that no matter when she is asked she will not have any info that changes her assumptions on the mean of the population being observed.

This *is* one of the harder parts to accept about SIA. You can model the new information as "she wakes up", which has probability 1 if heads and probability 2 if tails (because she wakes up twice). That *should* produce all the claims of SIA.

You haven't answered my reverse example, where she lives on tails only 1% of the time. In that case, clearly the fact that she lived is evidence for heads. If you gradually increase the rate at which she lives on tails, you gradually decrease the evidential import of her learning that she lives. I see no reason to stop at one; if she has 2 lives, their probabilities should add (if you deny this, I could cook up other scenarios that should force this kind of anthropic thinking on pain of paradox, like cloning her and then killing one copy with some probabilities).

I think there's also a terminological difference between us. You're referring to the "mean of the population" as the probability. The problem with that is that different people will calculate different means. When I say probability I mean subjective confidence. You need to take into account all information you have to get the probability.

(If your dichotomy matches mine, then we already agree, but I'm not sure if it does). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Intuition breaks down with such large numbers (see: Pascal's Mugging). Your brain can't represent 1000000 and rounds it down (see: scope insensitivity).

So while I share that particular intuition (and the related one in the Presumptuous Philosopher problem), I think it's a feature of those large numbers messing up our intuitions. (There's also the issue of uncertainty; if you're not completely sure of all aspects of the scenario, that can easily change the answer with these sized numbers, and while the problem is stated with surety, the brain "knows" that things are uncertain. To be explicit, your intuition refuses to assign a super-low probability to something that started out with a probability of 1/2, possibly in part because of uncertainty over whether any mistakes were made. If the probability of a mistake being made (or of SIA being wrong) is even 1/1000, that still makes for a far higher probability than your 1 in a trillion. So it's possible that you're doing a similar calculation subconsciously, and therefore rejecting something because of intuition despite the intuition not really applying.) </TEXT>

	<TEXT>   Even if she did know, Bayesian updating would only alter her strategy to answer correctly. The probability of answering correctly only has to do with the test parameters, which do not change the physics and resulting probabilities of a coin toss.  

Nobody's saying it changes the physics. Anyway, I'm struggling to understand how you understand Bayesian updating. I understand it as directly updating probabilities, but you seem to think it doesn't? Surely one can obtain evidence for any particular outcome without impacting physics?

You also seem to be using probability in some sense of "a priori". Which definition of probability are you talking about?

edit: from another of my comments:

 I lock SB in a room and put her to sleep. I flip a coin. If heads, I let her out. If tails, I pick a random number from 1-100 with a rng, and for all numbers except 100, I kill her in her sleep. If I picked 100, I wake her up. You are SB, you wake up. 

What would be her subjective probability that I got heads?

What if I always kill her on tails? If you concede in that case, it's a pretty straight line back to the original case.

	<TEXT> Well, the point of SIA is that you're more likely to exist in worlds with more of you. So if there are three possible copies of you, two in world a and one in world b, then you're more likely to be in a than in b. Your probability of being in b is 1/3, then.

It's important to remember that all these probabilities are subjective. Either the coin landed on heads or on tails (multiverses aside), the reason we assign probabilities to things that won't happen is because we *don't know* what will happen/has happened, i.e. uncertainty. So it's perfectly fine for different people to have different probabilities for something (for an extreme case, imagine I saw the coin land and you didn't, or the coin is biased but only one of us knows.)

Also, what I was getting at above is that you don't avoid the problems by halfing. If you learn the day is Monday, then your probabilities must change by Bayes theorem, but that seemingly should be equivalent to the case where she's only woken up on Monday, in which case it should obviously be 50/50. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So if I see the coin land on heads, I should still think there was a 50% chance that I imagined it, because math? Or, perhaps, evidence *can* change probabilities.

To give a more intuitive case: I lock SB in a room and put her to sleep. I flip a coin. If heads, I let her out. If tails, I pick a random number from 1-100 with a rng, and for all numbers except 100, I kill her in her sleep. If I picked 100, I wake her up. You are SB, you wake up. Does your "math" say that the probability of heads was equal to tails? This is pretty much the negative version of the problem.

Or as I've said elsewhere in this thread, consider her posteriors after learning that it's Monday. She can't still think heads and tails are equally likely, but you would naively claim she still should. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They answer two different questions. If the exact question is "What is the probability that the coin came up heads?" the answer is 1/2 and if the question is "What is the probability that you would be correct if you guessed the coin came up heads?" the answer would be 1/3.

Probability is inherently subjective, the first question is meaningless unless it means the second question.

If you disagree, explain what this "probability" you speak of means without referencing any individuals' experiences.

(If you mean "is the coin fair" in the frequentist sense, then obviously the answer is still yes; I wouldn't call that probability until it was turned into expectations, and anyway that's not what is meant by probability here. I think you're actually conceding that the basic reasoning is correct but you're using different definitions or something. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> its a silly notion at best. The probability of the coin being heads or tails is always 1/2. Unless i seriously misunderstood this, then the probability of the coin being heads or tails is 1/3rd because there are 3 possible outcomes from the observers perspective. The silliness here is assuming that because there is an unknowing observer, then the probability changes from the perspective of the observer. Personally I think this is wrong, the probability of heads or tails is the same. I also think its wrong from the observers perspective. I think that there is still a 1/2 chance of it being heads or tails, but from the point the question is asked the probability of it being monday is 3/4's and the probability of it being Tuesday is 1/4. If i've missed anything i hope someone lets me know. Who knows, this kind of thing might lead somewhere one day, I wonder what the probability of that is. 

So if she is told that it's Monday, what is her posterior on heads after a Bayesian update? How is that case different than when she's only woken on Monday regardless of coin flip? </TEXT>

(Also, consider her Bayesian update upon hearing that it's Monday.

	<TEXT> /u/CMAuGaming already recognizes that the probability of the sleeper being woken/asked in a scenario where the coin landed heads is truly only 1/3. But the question of probabilty of the coin landing heads is still simply 1/2.

Probability is subjective. If you concede that the subjective probability is 1/3 (I.e conditioning on being awake and being asked a question), what do you mean by saying the probability is 1/2? Do you think there's some objective "fact" that something has a probability of happening even if it doesn't happen? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> First, very few emails now days are sent in plain text unencrypted.  Almost all users have started using TLS, which means the emails would be transmitted encrypted in transit.  

You missed the point. It doesn't matter if the user accesses his email securely, because the emails themselves are sent over the internet unencrypted. Any server that processes the email (of which there are many "hops") can see it.

On the third point, if you have the key, then you have to be able to see the traffic between the site and the user in order to decrypt it.  That means you have to be tapped in very close to the server or very close to the end user.  Neither of those are easy, most require physical connections at the location.  True a proxy server would be a great way to go, but the user would still need to be using the proxy server.

It is simply too much work to steal an SSL key and then try to get that traffic.  Sure, if it were Amazon or Bank of America, then yea, go for it, having a key like that might be really useful.  Having a key for Bob's Putty Store who sells putty to 20 people a month isn't going to be as useful.

Bob's putty store doesn't need HTTPS if he doesn't need the security of HTTPS. This effectively reduces the security model of HTTPS to HTTP+email interception.

If you signed up for HTTPS, you should expect your keys to be safe.

	<TEXT>  Drones symbolize a failed war that is based on false pretences and lies, which are creating more terrorists rather than eradicating terror.

http://patrickjohnston.info/materials/drones.pdf

We find that drone
strikes are associated with decreases in the incidence and lethality of terrorist
attacks, as well as decreases in selective targeting of tribal elders.

...

A systematic analysis of the data reveals that drone strikes have succeeded in
curbing deadly terrorist attacks within the targeted territory in Pakistan. Specifically,
the key findings of our study show that drone strikes are associated with substantial
short-term reductions in terrorist violence along four key dimensions. First, drone
strikes are generally associated with a reduction in the rate of terrorist attacks. Second,
drone strikes are also associated with a reduction in the number of people killed as
a result of terrorist attacks, i.e., the lethality of attacks. Third, drone strikes are
also linked to decreases in selective targeting of tribal elders, who are frequently
seen by terrorist groups as conniving with the enemy and acting as an impediment
to the pursuit of their agenda. Fourth, we find that this reduction in terrorism is
not the result of militants leaving unsafe areas and conducting attacks elsewhere in
the region. On the contrary, there is some evidence that drone strikes have a small
violence-reducing effect in areas near those struck by drones.

If you've got actual data showing that it creates more terrorists, as opposed to some disgruntled former officials, let me know. </TEXT>

First of all, you don't need to hack an email; these are sent in *plain text unencrypted*, so anyone on the network path it was  on can see them. Second, if it's so useless, why don't you publish all your SSL keys for all the websites under your control?

Third, what "easier" method is there for passive decrypting https connections or actively mitming an https connection than this? 

The end user would need to be identified, then a MITM attack or network snooping setup on them.

Or set up a proxy server, then mitm all https connections through it that you've got the key for. </TEXT>

Nobody even thought these priests were abusing children untill the word got out so you can't truly know the actual rate of abuse the Catholics are only out because they were caught. 

You haven't provided any evidence of that. Surely you see the fallacy involved in going from "we can't know" to "one is definitely higher than the other".

Have you got any reason to believe that priests' abuse is less likely to be reported than other people?

I couldn't find a study of how many children were kicked out of their parents house onto the street because they had different religious beliefs (or none at all), so this is very much a hidden rate of child abuse (and yes this happens frequently in more conservative states and countries).

That's a very different problem than what you originally said, and requires different solutions. I fail to see how allowing premarital sex would address that at all.

	<TEXT>  One of the things I'm interested in is good-enough heuristics for when we don't have the time or ability to evaluate arguments. 

My heuristic is "if the idea isn't mainstream, and additionally I don't care enough to evaluate it, it's probably wrong, but keep an open mind about it seeing as you haven't looked at the arguments in depth".

And if the idea *is* mainstream, the reverse; accept that it's likely true, but keep an open mind about rethinking it should you suddenly start caring enough to do research.

The trick here is to get good definitions of mainstream. (Left as an exercise to the reader.)

There's also the point that even if you don't *know* that people believe something, they often will. You sort of get this intuitively once you've happened across enough worldview-challenging moments, and then you really *get* on some level that almost every viewpoint has some really strong arguments for it, and you should just be skeptical about things you can't research yourself.

I think that diminishes the usefulness of the heuristic, because you don't *have* first-person knowledge of what people believe.

 I would argue that getting some sense of what people believe in, even if it's not exact, is actually pretty efficient relative to argument evaluation (for most argument-person pairs).

In some cases, but only when you're explicitly not interested in being able to defend your conclusion, and are willing to accept a lower level of confidence. Also, I think the vast majority of the weight of evidence will come from a binary isMainstream.

(As for mainstream definition, you could say "mainstream among experts", but that can get complicated sometimes. [This post](http://nostalgebraist.tumblr.com/post/119000645209/slatestarscratchpad-nostalgebraist-my) is kind of related.) </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  I mean, I think "people believing in it" isn't just "at least one person believing it"; if more people believe in something, that's informative.

This might be more useful if we used specific examples. My standard one when talking about these kind of stuff is UFOs and aliens (which was also mentioned in another comment here). So, fine, the fact that people believe in them is evidence that they exist; but this is extremely low evidence.

Now, take an example where fewer people believe something. I can't actually give any examples, because if I've heard of it, probably a number of other people have as well, and some people believe everything they hear that agrees with their worldview (yes, really, read through comments on conspiracy websites until you're convinced of this). But if we imagine something that isn't that convincing to such [people, and therefore has fewer believers, is that reason to assign the evidence lower weight? Maybe, but the numbers are so small here that it doesn't really matter.

Some other things to factor in: maybe we should calculate (number of people hearing X)/(number of people believing X), to adjust for more people believing things that more people have heard of; you should also adjust in the other direction for correlation between popularity as opposed to belief, and truth.


In the end, I think other methods of finding truth are far more efficient; finding out how many people believe something requires you to do a survey, and if it's already been done, then chances are there's enough info about the topic to make a judgement anyway.

You also need to make sure you don't double-count this evidence; if people's beliefs are based on arguments, then conditioning on those arguments partly screens off those beliefs, and it's probably really hard to properly adjust for that. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes, but very weakly. In general, if a question even comes up and you're thinking about it, *someone somewhere* believes each side.

In your example, if nobody had ever believed in god we would never even ask the question! So as a heuristic, this seems useless, because it doesn't distinguish between anything you'll actually deal with.

(Put differently, the selection of possible beliefs you happen on already adjusts your implicit priors, making the question moot.) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Saw a quote once that said that most arguments end in a disagreement over who has the burden of proof. 

If you think you're right, you'll automatically think the burden of proof is on the other side. You need more subtle and robust ways of determining things. 

(Also, for any non-completely-batshit-crazy view, there will be a decent amount of "proof", and as it takes 10 times as much effort to disprove bs than to say it, you'll quickly need far more efficient heuristics for sorting through claims. Logical fallacies are good for debates with people who make them, but if you have any real debates they have diminishing returns.)

Edit: source is http://www.cawtech.freeserve.co.uk/pond_ap.2.html, full quote is

So any credit card with greater than around 1% rewards meant profit, and since everything was online there's almost no risk of the price changing.

I ordered 3 $100 cards, then tried to sell them to saveya. A few minutes later I got this from saveya:

We experienced an issue during balance verification for the following gift cards that you have submitted.

and

This code was previously acquired from this seller

listed as the reason.

So apparently you can't sell cards to saveya that saveya already sold at one point in time. I couldn't find anyone saying this, a [search](https://www.google.com/search?q="This+code+was+previously+acquired+from+this+seller") for the message turned up 0 hits, and I can't call saveya today because it's Sunday. Tried on giftcards.com, got a "security error".

Anyone have this experience? Anyone had this and succeeded after calling? Are there other buyers that will reject cards they've seen before? </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  In investing, if you don't think something has intrinsic value and I do, I win.

I'm not sure what you mean by winning here, but why is the default to assume intrinsic value without proof?

Besides, if we accept your claim that all you need to show that something has intrinsic value is someone claiming it does, then bitcoin *does* have intrinsic value, contra your above claim. ([Here's an example of someone who thinks it does have such value](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/12846/you-say-bitcoin-has-no-intrinsic-value-twenty-two-reasons-to-think-again/)). </TEXT>
