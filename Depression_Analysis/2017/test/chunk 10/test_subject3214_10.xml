	<TEXT> I think it's pretty interesting that the article mentions that the leader of the American Federation of Teachers actually sits on the board of a pro-Clinton Super PAC and then proceeded to have the entire union give Hillary its endorsement. Sounds like a favor that was waiting to be repaid.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey guys, I have a memory card with all my pictures on it from when I used to have a Blackberry (iPhone 5s now, please don't burn me), but I don't know how to view these old pictures when I upload the files to my PC. I've got about two years worth of pictures on there that I would like to finally see. Does anyone out there have a solution or are these files just stuck in encrypted limbo forever? Thanks so much for your help.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well today's our anniversary so we're re-creating our first date and having a picnic in the big park in our city. After we eat, we're reading love letters that we wrote each other for the occasion (her idea, but it works nicely). I'll make sure she reads hers first and the I'll read mine. I've got a nice cheesy line at the end of it that makes a nice transition to me getting down on one knee. I know she's going to say yes, but I can't shake these nerves.  </TEXT>
