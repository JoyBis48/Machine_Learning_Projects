	<TEXT> It's the original hardcover from January 1996, but the words "First Edition" aren't on the copyright page. What does the number line mean? Can I tell which print it is? Would it technically be a "First Edition # Print? It's never even been read, if it's a much later print, why did he sign it? Thanks in advance. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> By the way, I know all about the withdrawals. Hands down worst withdrawals of my life. Those are the kinds of withdrawals they portray in movies (Ray, Trainspotting, Johnny Cash). In movies they're always exaggerated like crazy... but now I'm beginning to think the directors of those movies are just fentanyl addicts.

I've only had acetyl fentanyl once, about 700 mg, and every time after that I've gotten butyr fentanyl instead.... and for some reason acetyl fentanyl is way way way fuckin worse. IDK why. Doesn't make much sense to me, but it definitely without a doubt is. I couldn't even go to work on acetyl withdrawals.... I can't do anything the first day except lay in bed and shiver and shake uncontrollably... butyr doesn't come close to making me do that, and I can go to work on butyr too, although I'm not the most productive on those days, lol.

	<TEXT> Butyr is 4 time less potent than fentanyl, acetyl is 15, but other than that, i'd have to say the effects are still the same. I prefer butyr fent by far, since my most frequent  ROA is vaping and acetyl fent just requires vaping too much powder. 

Unfortunately I couldn't compare the duration between acetyl and butyr because as I said above, I can't smoke acetyl.... therefore I ended up snorting it, and I will say that snorted acet does last longer than vaped butyr, but that's to be expected with most anything when vaped vs. snorted, no? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm sure it's there, you just gotta find the right people. Tons of people are probably shake and baking. and I'm sure at least a few are doing anhydrous cooks. Your best bet would be to find the anny cooks, because although shake and bake can be decent, most don't know how to do it right. Anny cooks generally have a better understanding of what they're doing. Forget about finding ice though. You'll have to hit up the darknet for that, son. Whatever you decide to do, don't start cooking it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Acetyl fentanyl is 6% as potent as fentanyl. Butyr fentanyl is 25% as potent as fentanyl. So if acetyl fentanyl is being sold for 60 bucks a g, then butyr fentanyl should be somewhere in the range of 240 a g, correct? 

So, go to whichever site you're looking at and compare the prices. The acetyl fent is generally the one that's always priced worse, bang for your buck wise. </TEXT>
