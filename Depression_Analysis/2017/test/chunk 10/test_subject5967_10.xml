	<TEXT> At our store, we're more concerned about a candidate's ability to drive sales, get along with coworkers and provide good customer service to our customers than we are about their knowledge of books. Our interview questions generally begin with, "Describe a time when..." We carry 2 million titles in the store, so even the most voracious reader won't be very familiar with the vast majority of what we sell. We're looking for team players who are friendly to customers and don't shy away from the selling aspect of the job (we are there to make money, after all). Good luck!  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Idea: Instead of writing letters to the editors of our local papers, why don't we write them to papers in Iowa? </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm sure many of you either participated in or at least saw the Facebook event last Saturday for a letter writing campaign. The goal was to get as many Bernie supporters as possible to write a letter to the editor of their local paper stating why they support him for president. This was a fun and quick (most newspapers have a 200 word limit) way to potentially reach a lot of people. 


Why don't we do the same thing, but send the letters to various papers in Iowa? I guess the letters are supposed to be submitted by locals, but I don't think that's a requirement. Imagine if, this Sunday, every newspaper in Iowa has at least one letter to the editor in support of Bernie Sanders. That could potentially make a difference in the race.  </TEXT>

The book is less than $10 and **all authorial proceeds are donated to charity**. Consider it your good deed for the day AND you get an excellent book out of it. 


Also, I can't confirm this, but another user mentioned that putting the book in your cart will raise its rank on Amazon even if you don't buy it. 


Lastly, Bernie has another book called *[Outsider in the House](http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/1859841775/ref=pd_aw_sbs_14_4?refRID=12267PXWT3J0095Q5C2P)*, currently #924,515 on Amazon, although it appears to be out of print.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You've already received some good answers, but I want to provide another perspective. Look at [this chart]( https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2delGcbK8FF7ck_fgtGWaA1iE5c=/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3657424/bernie_hillary_donations.png) showing who the largest donors to Hillary and Bernie are throughout their careers. You'll notice that Hillary receives most of her money from large corporations like Citigroup, Goldman Sachs JPMorganchase, and Lehman Brothers. In fact, almost every donor on the list is a major corporation. Compare that list to the list of Bernie's donors, which are almost all worker's unions. 


Organizations donate to political campaigns as an investment. They think the rewards they get from having their candidate elected will be greater than their initial investment. Now I don't know your situation, but I would guess that you, as I and most Americans do, would benefit more from the success of laborers, engineers, teachers and machinists than you would from the success of Citigroup, Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley. 


If you want to know who a politician will be loyal to, just look at who their major donors are.  </TEXT>

My advice is to only ask people to use one hashtag and to make it #Bernie2016. People will throw in other hashtags that they like, but #Bernie2016 is simple an it gets our message across.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> One of the biggest problems we face is the lack of media coverage. Writing letters to the media will go a long way in resolving this, but it's also important that we thank those websites that do cover Bernie by giving them their clicks. At the end of the day, websites are trying to get views and they will notice if they get an abnormally high number of views every time they post a Bernie story. When this happens, we can expect to see more coverage. So, don't just read the headlines on the front page. Actually visit the website; comment if you have the time. Make it a smart business decision for websites to cover the campaign.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would say 33% on July 2 puts us ahead of schedule. Most of us expect, reasonably I would say, to get another bump in the polls once the debates start. There's also the fact that Biden, who has shown no signs of running is at 7%. Who are those 7%? Could they be polling for Biden as an anti-Hillary protest. I suspect that those 7% could easily switch to Bernie supporters, assuming Biden doesn't jump into the race late.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Here's mine: short and sweet.


 Good afternoon,


Due to a prior commitment, I was unable to watch the live stream of Bernie Sanders' campaign rally in Madison last night. I figured I would still be able to read about it this morning in the NYT. Disappointinly, there wasn't a single mention of the event in today's paper. This is shocking because an estimated 10,000 people attended the rally, making it the largest campaign event for any candidate this election season. Senator Sanders is rising in the polls and is making the race for the Democratic Party nomination very interesting. In the future, please provide some form of coverage of rallies that draw crowds this large, for any candidate. It's a noteworthy achievement and a possible indicator of an exciting race this year.



Thank you,

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I haven't found a "real" job yet, although I haven't seriously looked. I'm still working the same retail job I started when I was 18. I was recently promoted to a lead position and I have an interview this week for a manager position. I don't want to make a long term career out of this job, but I figure it can't hurt to be able to put "manager" on future resumes. 


In the meantime, what can I do to make myself a desirable applicant in the future? The problem is I don't know what I want to do, so I can't tailor my skill set to my dream job. What are the skills I should teach myself or experience I should get if my goal is to land a 30k+ job within one year? 


I apologize if this question gets asked a lot, which I assume it does. I'm new to this subreddit and I really appreciate your help.  </TEXT>

[Combo #1](http://imgur.com/j1HnoRF) (Gingham shirt, knit skinny tie)


[Combo #2](http://imgur.com/75HJB11) (Solid white shirt, floral skinny tie)


[Combo #3](http://imgur.com/Z3HGqV6) (Solid white shirt, stripped knit tie)



All three seem a little off to me, but I can't quite put my finger on why. Maybe it's just because I'm not used to seeing it.  </TEXT>
