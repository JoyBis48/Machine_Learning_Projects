	<TEXT> One of the inhibitors I feel when thinking of starting a business of my own is my age (I'm 40), I feel like the ramp up of a business would take too long to pay off relative to my rather good paying job.  How long has it taken you to get your businesses self-sufficient?  (I believe they call this "crossing the valley of death.")

	<TEXT> We should be able to respond to users without our usernames being visible.  We can send messages from the subreddit, but we can't respond to modmail this way. If you're explaining the official stance of the subreddit to a hostile user I don't see why your username is important. (The number of users who argue that the rules should not apply to them is too damn high!) It's just a way for users better target individual mods.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree, actually, the admins need to actually do something, most of the time there is just no response.  having a fully open mod log would allow bad actors to laser focus on the person who just enforced a rule.  This already happens way too much.  If you respond to a mod mail to explain why something was removed, even though you didn't do the removal, you can end up being comment stalked, and doxxed. 

I think there is a disconnect because users don't see the incredibly hostile messages the mods of big subreddits constantly get.  We have constant reminders of how terrible people can be. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Wicking is a balance between gravity (the density of the fluid) and the surface adhesion of for the wick.  Trees are essentially ground water wicks that bring water to their leaves. Since water has a high affinity for cellulose, trees can grow quite tall!  But that's not your question.

If we are looking for an unwickable liquid, we would want high weight, and strong cohesive forces.  Off the top of my head, mercury fits this.  Mercury will spread out on certain metal surfaces, like aluminum, but it is actually dissolving the metal in the process, which would make for a poor wick!  It doesn't spread on normally found materials like wood, or plastic or glass.

Another possibility would be fluorocarbons, since they tend to repel both hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Subreddit Policy Changes: New Rules for Headlines and Link Flair </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-07-11 20:30:46 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi everyone,

A constant complaint we've had is the sensationalism of headlines, we've discussed the issue, and we're going to start enforcing some new rules for headlines.
 In addition to the [existing rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/wiki/rules#wiki_submission_rules), we're adding these.

**Headlines may not:**

  - **ask a question** (anything with a '?') Linked articles which have a question in the title should be re-written to describe the content of the paper in keeping with our existing rules against editorializing and sensationalizing.

  - **make claims of resolving a long standing issue/cure/mystery.**

  -  **use an exclamation point.**

  - **makes general statements about large groups** (e.g. "men don't trust women", "Doctors hate him") The headline should indicate the group that the finding applies to.

  - **have a list mentioned.** (e.g. top 10 things you must read)

  - **makes reference to the thoughts or feelings of the reader.**  (e.g. "You'll never expect this")

  - **contain the word "[Video]" or related terms** (since we don't allow videos, linking to a page that contains a video is not allowed.)


**All Submission must have flair assigned**

The mods have been assigning appropriate flair to unflaired submissions, but we are no longer going to do this.  Unflaired submissions will be removed.  There will be 5 minutes of time to flair a post, after which it will be subject to removal, with notification.

If you have additional thoughts on how to make more specific headline rules or add rules, we'd like to hear them.  We will be testing things out and we may make changes as needed. 

Thanks!
