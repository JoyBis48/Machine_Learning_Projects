	<TEXT> Personally I actually really loved [Skyfall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4gdhsVKTcs) but there are tons of classics, Casino Royale also had a great opening which felt very much in line with the theme of the film. The Brosnan era had some great ones as well apart from Die Another Day. Which ones do you guys rate?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So on more than a few occasions my PSN store will never load, nor will any of the content under any of the games I own. The only way to fix this is to restart/standby my PS4 and go instantly into the store as soon as I log into my account. Anyway to fix this permanently as it's really annoying.  </TEXT>

Really? I think it's one of the most intuitive UI's I have seen in a racing game. Easy to navigate and it remembers your previous selections so you don't have to mess around selecting what you wanted again. Also the addition of pressing the HOME button to go back to the base menu is a function every game should have.

The full game adds a lot more cars, especially since they have released quite a few cars for free as well and then full game also has 5 more locations (Norway, Japan, Scotland, Canada and Chile). IMO it's worth getting it since I hear its pretty cheap now as well.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> **Sense8** So the reviews for this show have been fairly divisive but I am currently on episode 11 and the show has been getting really good in my opinion, the first few episodes are very exposition heavy as they are setting up a rather complex scenario but once that is all out of the way it really gets flowing. Really strange that the show went from 8+ on imdb down to around low 7s and then went back up to 8+, I am guessing that people felt the show picked up and got better as well?  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So do you guys/gals think that we'll ever see a mature rated Star Wars television series? It doesn't have to be mature in terms of violence but perhaps with much more heavier/serious adult themes instead that aren't really tackled in the films all that much. I remember hearing about the cancelled Star Wars Underworld series which was in development before Disney bought Lucasfilm which revolved around the Coruscant underworld, sounded amazing in my opinion. Imagine if HBO were allowed to develop a Star Wars series *drools*.  </TEXT>
