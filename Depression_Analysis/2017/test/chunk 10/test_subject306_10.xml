	<TEXT> Hey, fellow WVD!  When I was diagnosed at birth, my parent's didn't get too involved, but as I got older I wanted to learn everything there is to know.  I also used to work for NHF, so if you have any questions, feel free to PM me.  

[National Hemophilia Foundation](http://www.hemophilia.org/Bleeding-Disorders/Types-of-Bleeding-Disorders) is a good start to understand the basics as well as other bleeding disorders.  Also, you can 1.800.42.HANDI and ask for any VWD educational info.  They will send it to you free of charge

I would also contact your local chapter depending on what city/state you live in.  They will be a good resource for you depending on the types of programs they offer. 

If you don't know yet, you must learn to self infuse.  Your HTC should teach you this.  

I'm sure other people in this sub will chime in.  Good luck and no worries </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think Lee's liability on defense will limit his minutes esp come playoff time.  Going against Aldridge, Ibaka, Duncan, etc he's going to be outmatched.  Also the pace of playoff basketball slows down to a lot more to half court sets, which is another knock against Lee.   </TEXT>
