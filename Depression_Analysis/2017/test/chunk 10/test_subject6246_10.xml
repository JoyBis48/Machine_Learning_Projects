	<TEXT> Tried both hard killing and clearing cache. I would like to be able to set the clock to 10 seconds for some exercises like the L-sit. I'm a total newbie and still use the lowest reps and seconds for each exercise. Values higher then 15 seconds works fine. Thanks again! :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have a problem after the update. Towards the end of my workout today my clock got "stuck" at 00:15. I cant change the seconds to anything else than :15 if I don't also add at least a minute. I can change the settings but as soon as i click "ok" the clock goes back to 00:15. It worked just fine when I started the workout. Maybe I'm the only one with this problem? Love the app! Thank you!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have to keep reminding myself that even if I don't reach my goals as planned it's okay. I will get there eventually. Goals are fun and motivating and they should stay that way. Don't let them mess with your head. Soon you will reach your one year anniversary a much healthier person than before. Take a moment to celebrate your accomplishments and then keep on going for round two.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is actually my first time with C25k but I used a similar program years ago when I first started running. I never stopped thinking about it either. Feels so right now. Congrats on your comeback too!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm starting Zombies, run! this sunday. My first goal is to have fun with that for some time. Then I will be working on both distance and speed. My longest run ever was 12k and it would be fun to beat that. I also hope to be able to run a 5k under 30 minutes some time. Not very ambitious goals maybe but they are enough for me. :) </TEXT>
