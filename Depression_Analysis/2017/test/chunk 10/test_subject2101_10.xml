	<TEXT> Um, no.

 Catholicism and its adjectival form Catholic are used as broad terms for describing specific traditions in the Christian churches in theology, doctrine, liturgy, ethics, and spirituality.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholicism

The major difference about Catholics from other Christians (disclaimer: I am a baptised Catholic, but not a trained or practicing one), is that they believe the Pope (you the one, ~~Dr. EverythingBeAllright~~ the guy with the tall hat ^^^^^St ^^^^^Peter ^^^^^was ^^^^^a ^^^^^rabbit that lives in the Vatican) speaks the word of God (or something similar), and therefore holds sway over the Catholic Church and its believers world-wide.

The reason people freaked out a bit about JFK being a Catholic, is that they thought that would mean that Rome could secretly control or otherwise influence JFK if he was elected.  A somewhat realistic fear based on hi~~s~~story]. </TEXT>

As an IT guy and wire-runner in another life, I always recommend to go through a place and check all the telco outlets.  Open them, and clean them.  Yep, clean the contacts.  Old wiring will accumulate dust even in between the contacts that are screwed-down.  Unscrew 'em, clean or cut the wire, and re-attach.

For myself, I will go through a premise and re-punch/attach/whatever all the wiring that all my future communications depend on. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Nothing empirical.  Only concerns regarding family ties and/or loyalties to the emperor.

AFAIK from what I learned at Manzanar, there were no discovered cases of Japanese-American disloyalty of any of the people interned or otherwise having served in the US armed forces during that time.

The problem is always with "concern" though, and the fear mongering that goes with it.  This was also on the heels of a lot of *"they took our jobs"* backlashing against Japanese immigrants.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If I may add a point, not doing well at something is not a sufficient reason to be racist.  Particularly not a reason to round up an entire race of people, force them to lose all of their possessions (only allowed to take a suitcase), take them out to the middle of nowhere (hundreds of miles from where they lived) and make them build their own "housing", keep them within a fortified encampment with guard towers, force them to sign documents with unclear ambiguous statements, ...   you know what - I'm just gonna stop here.

Manzanar was disturbingly close to a Nazi concentration camp.  I realize that a nazi comparison is strong, but in terms of US history, its true.  Hindsight always shows you at your worst, but its not an excuse for a "but" statement.  What we did was wrong.  There are not "but"s to excuse this.

2. **OP intercepted property that was exchanged in a business transaction**.  The original owner made a choice of what to do with their property, and who to give it to.  It wasn't discarded as "trash".  It was recycled for a fee and with an intent.  You dont get free dibs on items that are still going through a business cycle.  OP is interfering with the recycling process for personal gain, instead of letting the related businesses thrive from the business.

	<TEXT> No they didnt.  I live in LA, and watched the entire event live.  ABC7 interviewed a CalFire rep about this (the drone), and the rep said that they did not ground any aircraft - although it is typically procedure to.

In this situation, they did not ground or otherwise prevent and helicopters or other aircraft into the airspace to assist in putting out the fire.

I'm not saying its not a serious issue, etc, etc.  But its untrue that any aircraft were grounded or deterred because of the Cajon Pass fire on Friday afternoon. </TEXT>
