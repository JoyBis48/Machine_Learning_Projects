	<TEXT> With the exception of 1976 and the three-party elections of the Bill Clinton Era, when the Democratic share of the vote actually went down, but Clinton won some Southern states due to Perot, the GOP swept the field in the South after 1964. The democratic share of the congressional delegations from the south more gradually deteriorated as incumbents held on, often by becoming Republicans in all but name (Zell Miller comes to mind.)

The whole discussion is confused by the fact that the political parties were not as ideologically aligned back then as they are now. There were plenty of Republicans more liberal than most Southern Democrats.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Those links show exactly the trend I was talking about... there was clearly a shift in the Republican attitude towards Civil Rights after Goldwater won the nomination in '64 and then with Nixon's Southern Strategy (yes, 5 deep southern states went for Wallace, but the rest went for Nixon.) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The racist white southerners voted for Democrats locally and at the State level but GOP at the national level? For Senators and Congressmen?

Correct. That voting pattern persisted for decades and is well-documented.

30 out of 32 GOP Senators voted for the CRA.

What CRA are you talking about? The Community Reinvestment Act?

Why would racist white southerners vote for Democrats locally who didn't push civil rights but a national GOP that did?

Because the GOP was to the right of the Democrats on Civil Rights on a national level after 1964. Goldwater and Nixon were seen as being more sympathetic to Southern white "interests" than LBJ and Humphrey. 

P.S. LBJ was a southern Democrat

So was Al Gore. Politics is strange.

	<TEXT>  1) The Republican party lost the the black American vote over civil rights in the 60's. 

More accurately, the Democratic Party lost the *white* Southern vote in the 60's due to Civil Rights, then the GOP lost the black vote as they swept in to pick up those voters. At the time, the Republicans were trading a smaller voting bloc for a bigger one. Smart politics. At the time. But karma's a bitch. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not necessarily. To be regarded as scientifically valid, a phenomenon needs to be replicable. Most reports of "supernatural" phenomena indicate an unpredictable and sporadic pattern of occurrence. A person might claim to experience precognition, or see a "ghost" once or twice in a lifetime. This could very well be because such phenomena do not in fact exist, and are the result of malfunctioning brains or sense organs, but if they do exist, this unpredictable pattern could be why they have never been scientifically proven.

Another thing to consider is the relationship between subjective states and physical objects. Some subjective states (for example, seeing the color red) have a physical correlate (an object that emits light in the red wavelengths). These states can thus be studied by science in an indirect manner since their causes are known, even if the exact relationship between the object and the subjective state it engenders is still a matter of fierce debate.

However, if there are subjective states that *do not* have a physical correlate, than these states might forever be outside the realm of scientific examination. Examples might include mystical experiences, the feeling of subtle energies such as chi or prana, etc.

Science can certainly observe the brainwaves of people who claim to be experiencing such states, but that is different from directly studying the (potentially supernatural) *object* that could be engendering these states. Note how this is unlike studying a brain that is seeing a color red, where the object emitting the light can be directly observed.

None of this proves anything about the actual existence of the supernatural of course, it merely casts doubts on those who believe that science itself is an "all-seeing eye" with a truly universal method for obtaining knowledge.

I think these considerations answer your second question as well: Science has no choice but to assume that only naturalistic phenomena are at work because its method can see nothing else.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> "Actually collect taxes" would be good, but it's difficult. There is actually a clause in the Greek constitution preventing the taxing of shipping. Guess what the biggest industry in Greece is? Therefore Greece relies heavily on sales taxes, and even taxes on utility bills, which fall most heavily on the poor.

Some labor market reforms are called for, but severely cutting the pensions of people who are already retired, and often supporting multiple unemployed adult offspring, will only be counterproductive. </TEXT>

This is the first explanation of this move that I've seen that even halfway makes sense, and that manipulation is documented already in the case of Hanergy, where the CEO was borrowing from shady shell companies he controlled so he could buy more of his own stock every time the price threatened to go down.

You are too modest sir...

yet "something" would be similarly empty--it would be merely static existence.

Good post and I agree with 95% of what you wrote, but I think we need to explore this statement a little more - why would an "absolute" something be static?

	<TEXT> Quantum physics shows that vacuum states are unstable, and while this is very interesting, it doesn't tell us why there is something rather than nothing, and if we feign that it does by defining "nothing" as vacuum states, or something like this, then we're guilty of a fallacy of equivocation.

Good point, and actually one I've made elsewhere, pointing out that Leonard Krauss commits this fallacy. To clear up what I meant, QM "nothing" is obviously not an *absolute* "nothing" with no laws, no physical objects, etc., but the fact that the state as close as you can get to "nothingness" within that system is unstable is suggestive of the theory that "nothingness" within *any* system, even a necessarily true one like formal logic, is also unstable. Not a proof of this assertion by any means, but suggestive none the less.

How can something be both necessarily true and contradictory, i.e. necessarily false? 

Logic is necessarily true, but it's not necessarily contradictory. It's only contradictory if we allow it to refer only to itself. 

Also, why should not having "a final referent to something that's not a logical statement" make a logical statement contradictory?

If logical statements refer only to themselves, eventually they will form a self-referential loop with all the self-reference paradoxes arising. Many attempts to axiomatize logic put limits on logical self-reference, but this requires a ultimate "ground" or referrent that is not itself a logical statement.

But if we re-frame consciousness as being primarily about choice...
Then we're just changing the subject.

I think there's a connection - [see my reply to OP here](http://www.reddit.com/r/PhilosophyofScience/comments/32kp1i/the_connection_between_the_origin_of_matter_and/cqcxfj9). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm having a hard time conceiving of what you mean from a hard materialist position. Do you have anything else you could say about it?

It's hard to stay a "hard materialist" once you start contemplating these questions, in my opinion. Basically there needs to be some sort of free agent to make the primordial choice for what exists. It doesn't follow that this is a conventional "God" in any sense, however. It could be more like Schopenhauer's Will. 

I'm not familiar with these, what are they? I can also look it up myself of course but I'd love to hear your thoughts if you don't mind. 

The multiverse theory holds that this not the only Universe, there are other Universes out there, perhaps with their own laws of physics, etc.

As for the paradoxes of the actual infinite, you can start with Hilbert's Hotel or the fact that the infinite sum of the series 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 +.... actually equals negative 1 if we assume you can actually do "infinite sums" instead of treating them as approximations of very large but finite operations.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've recently realized that "why is there something rather than nothing?" is actually the *easy* question of fundamental ontogeny. While scientists and philosophers don't have an exact answer yet, it is obvious that somehow "nothingness" is unstable/impossible, as seen in Quantum Physics.

My own personal preference is for the theory is that formal logic is necessarily true, but also contradictory if it doesn't have a final referent to something that's not a logical statement (that is, a material object or something like it rather than an abstraction like a rule of logic.) This creates a need for a "necessary object."

So if what was called the Ultimate Question is really the easy question, then what's the hard question? It has to be why *this particular* something, rather than any of the other possibilities that might have served as adequate necessary objects.

Even if we live as part of a "multiverse," this doesn't solve the problem, as there can be only a finite number of universes, or else all the logical contradictions of Actual Infinities would arise.

What does any of this have to do with consciousness? Not too much, if we define consciousness in terms of awareness, qualia, etc. But if we re-frame consciousness as being primarily about *choice*, with those other qualities emerging later as consequences, then I think we're on to something. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am trying to make my way through Yanofsky's "Outer Limits of Reason" and I am on the section about the Incompleteness Theorems. I was following his argument pretty well until it got to the following:

He defines a predicate as a function that takes a number as an input and gives a logical value (true or false) as its output.

He then defines a fixed point of a predicate F(x) as a logical statement C such that F("C")=C, where "C" is the Gdel Number of C.

It appears that our predicate F(x) now outputs a logical *statement* instead of a logical *value*. Am I missing something here or is the author being sloppy in his explanation?

I agree with everything else you said, but wouldn't suppressing demand pressure yields *higher*?

	<TEXT> Pick any number. Let's use 30:

2 is a factor of 30. But the next number after 30 that's a multiple of 2 is 32...

3 is a factor of 30 too. But the next number after 30 that's a multiple of 3 is 33...

...and so on.

See what happens? Poor old 31 is always left out. It can't ever share any factors with 30 (other than 1 of course.)

As for a formal proof, take any whole number "x" such that x1 and x is a factor of n. 

Since x is a factor of "n", then n/x is a whole number. 

But what about (n+1)? Well, for "n+1" to have "x" as a factor (n+1)/x would have to be a whole number. But distributing the division in the previous statement yields n/x+1/x. 

We already showed that n/x is a whole number, and 1/x is obviously not a whole number (since x1), and a whole number plus a non-whole number is never a whole number. </TEXT>
