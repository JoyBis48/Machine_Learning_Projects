	<TEXT> This is not the point, nor is it the case.

There's a reason why they wanted the Xeon Phi. Because for supercomputing applications, it's either that or the (also U.S-dev'd) GPU accelerators. 

The actual point is that the U.S. just hastened the development of competitive chips (lower price, power, etc). This was probably happening already, but it was a firm kick in the ass to start kicking ass.

The people that design the policies and trade restrictions do so in a technological vacuum. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So much CFD is done on workstations. But for building clusters turned for ANSYS and other applications, sometimes it helps to attend training sessions at user conferences. I know ANSYS has them, in fact, most do. Other integrators do training sessions for end users but would be happy to host someone looking to learn. And the universities with HPC centers would prob be willing to chat hardware with you. Always read stuff too, there's not a lot of HPC specific stuff that isn't PR from HPCwire, which used to be great before they lost their good writers, but Beowulf boards (Beowulf.org) is great for specific questions  </TEXT>
