	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> This came out BEFORE Warehouse 13. It was a website that people could submit content to. The format was that you were reading files on a secret asylum for dangerous supernatural objects and/or creatures. Each story was given a case number and some of them were terrifying. I seem to remember one of them was about a man sized doll like thing that always stood in the corner, but if the lights went off, or someone stopped watching the camera feed, it would move to a new location. (Pretty sure this is Pre-Weeping Angels) Any ideas? I've looked and looked and haven't come back across it. Thanks in advance for any help. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As much as I want to agree, we fired him and Cincinnati gave him a place to land. Instead, we should be proud that the Ohio NFL is completely in honor of Paul Brown. Cincinnati is the only team in the AFCN that I have respect for, and the way they treated Paul Brown is the main reason. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It started originally in fiction as the symbol that the High Priestesses led by Vivian, The Lady of the Lake, wore in The Mists of Avalon. It has become, through pop culture, a symbol of women who are leaders within Wicca. It shows a person who is empowered. Not everyone uses it, but it was a powerful day when the women in our group decided to get their tattoos. Since getting hers, my woman is now the leader of the largest Wiccan church in the world: The Aquarian Tabernacle Church. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I just want the people on my team to have some social media sense. They need it to be a good example for the man literally rehabilitating off of social media. I'm not all in on Johnny, my history will show me as a Hoyer fan, but I understand addiction, and social media is part of his addiction. I DO want him to succeed. This kind of stuff hinders that, imo. 

Additionally, I would be willing to bet that if West, Crow, and Duke are in a three way tie, it will come down to personal conduct, and this kind of stuff shows a person as not being mature. Will that impact the front offices opinion on him? *Shrug* I just hope for a good, powerful, responsible, team. **We Bark Together**

The most made up part of this whole account is the stuff you threw in there. I told you no one was home except for me, my wife with long red hair, a tattooed man and his long haired, heavy set wife. We live in the middle of the country. We don't even have sidewalks. No kids were home. Also, the dog rolling in the yard wouldn't allow anyone to just randomly be there. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A little background. We just returned home to our house in GA. It is also a small local church with a small congregation that has been meeting there while we have been gone. It has always been haunted. You can just feel it, hear it, doors won't open, lights will go funny, etc. We have been gone, and the people watching it had vacated and it was in a level of disrepair that had me really unhappy. Two people from the folks from the church were there. A tall skinny man and his wife, who is very heavy set with long hair.  I took this establishing shot because my wife and I were considering selling it. I then thought I had caught a weird energy ribbon  on the porch. I freaked out because I thought it was an apparition. Then I realized it looked just like the man who was over, and I decided to prank  my wife and show her the "ghost" I found in this picture. She freaked out just like I did. I then told her it was just our friend and she laughed and commented that it looked so creepy we should a how it to the guy himself and tell him it was a ghost, only to reveal it is actually himself. It would be hilarious! So we did it. Only he sobered us up in return. This was actually looking in the same 2 hours, mind you. He said: "My hat's red, man. And that arm of mine is covered in tattoos" He pointed to his Nascar hat (the hat in the picture looks brown), and pulled his sleeve up to reveal a wizard tattoo. Then my wife notices the second figure crouched down in front of the lowest red circle on the wall, seeming to be sitting. But there is nothing but a shelf there, and then we noticed where the man pointing toward the door is standing was nothing but building supplies and junk. 

So, there it is. I don't know, but I know those weren't people that were here. My wife says that they look like Kenny Paradise (the tall skinny guy) and Doc Thompson (the sitting guy that looks like he is wearing glasses and blue scrubs) they both used to live here, and she says she has met them both before they died. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I bought this off a Jain (follower of Jainism) who explained to me that the color comes from the idols in India where they smear a paste of tumeric and the red color that they use to make the dot on their third eye, which makes this color. Awesome picture, btw! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, I would have a show like Oprah. 
I would be the host of, everyday Christmas
Give Dusty a wish list. 
I'd probably pull an Angelina and Brad Pitt. 
And adopt a bunch of babies that ain't never had shit. 

Give away a few Mercedes like, "Here, lady, have this". 
And last but not least grant somebody their last wish. 
It's been a couple months since I've single so. 
You can call me Travie Claus, minus the "Ho Ho". 

Get it, I'd probably visit where Katrina hit. 
And damn sure do a lot more than FEMA did. 
Yeah, can't forget about me, stupid. 
Everywhere I go I'mma have my own theme music. 

I'll be playing basketball with the President
Dunking on his delegates. 
Then I'll compliment him on his political etiquette. 
Toss a couple milli in the air just for the heck of it. 
But keep the fives, twenties, tens and bens completely separate. 
And yeah I'll be in a whole new tax bracket
We in recession but let me take a crack at it. 
I'll probably take whatever is left and just split it up. 
So everybody that I love can have a couple bucks. 
And not a single tummy around me would know what hungry was. 
Eating good, sleeping soundly. 
I know we all have a similar dream. 
Go in your pocket pull out your wallet and put it in the air and sing.

	<TEXT> "The only coach in the NFL not connected to Paul Brown is Chip Kelly"

The funny thing about that in my opinion, is no coach reminds me of Paul Brown, with his ability to create new ways to play the game while skirting the rules, like Chip Kelly did with the remote controlled car during mini camp. Brown would have pulled that same card if they had portable video and remote controlled cars in 1950. </TEXT>

I can only defer to the people I asked, and if you think it's a Summer Tanager, and they DO look very similar, I am going to assume I just saw the most vibrant avatar of the Summer Tanager in existence and be proud!

	<TEXT> It was about the size of a cardinal, but it had no crest. The pictures that have been suggested are not what I saw, but thank you for the interest. I have been busy and am just getting back. The top half of it was cardinal red. Like it was the neck of a [Makers Mark]( http://img3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20111216193258/whiskey/images/a/a1/Makersmark.jpg) whiskey bottle. Then the lower half of it was yellow to orange, or orange to yello, but the difference between the red and the rest of the body was dramatic. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was driving down to the boat launch, and near the bend in the road, this bird was standing in middle of the street. It had no black on its body. If a Phoenix was actually a canary, then this little candle flame of a bird was a Phoenix. It was so neat and as an avid bird watcher, I screamed when I saw it, because I had never seen anything like it. I couldn't get my phone out before it flew away. I have been on WhatABird and all over Google and I can't find it. Any ideas?
