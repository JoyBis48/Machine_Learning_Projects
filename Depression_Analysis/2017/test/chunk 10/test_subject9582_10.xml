	<TEXT> If you think about it, per an earlier post about the common rooms, The dungeons are cold and not really a place for a snake to be active. I understand how something as large as a basilisk could hibernate in the chamber. It's cold, and snakes sleep when it's cold.

I also understand that the students aren't snakes, but the Ravenclaws were in an aerie(tower), Gryffin(dors) a tower also, Hullfepuffs(badger) were a bit below like a den. Do snakes really sleep that far underground?

**totally unrelated:**
I was watching the 1973 Disney version of Robin Hood today, and Friar Tuck is a badger, so was the Fat Friar. When they showed reward posters for Robin Hood, it was paid in **ingotts.** </TEXT>
