There are a wide-range of myths scattered about the U.S. in relation to a specific area and it would make the story that much more interesting if the myth could be proven or debunked in the exact location where it was said to have taken place.

	<TEXT> Pros: knowing that you're changing to something that works.

Cons: complete utter hell. I spent a few weeks gradually weaning off of Cymbalta, even though my doctor was against it. I wanted to change medications and it was my only option. I experienced horrible mood swings, I would want to scream and throw things (I had a tendency of doing this before taking antidepressants), my body felt numb, I couldn't eat, all I wanted to do was sleep, and is something I hope I never have to go through again.


This may not be the same thing experienced by other people, but weaning of an antidepressant such as Cymbalta has it's downsides. BUT it is definitely worth it if you are changing to something that works.

I am currently on a medication that works and doesn't interfere with my anxiety meds. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well at least everyone will know where to find the command centers.

I would just like to put it out there that they know we expect an attack on the 4th..meaning that they'll want to hit us off-guard and NOT attack on the 4th. Especially if they know we are prepared.

Also, enough with the scare tactics. People are paranoid as is, try not to make it worse. Best thing to do would be to not publicize what the FBI plans to do and just do it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In case there is a pay wall,

The Senate joined the House by approving a session-ending bill Friday making adjustments to legislation imposing a state tax increase of $432 million next year that constitutes the largest in Kansas history.

Public begging and private bullying that defined the session's votes on tax policy prompted adoption by the bare minimum -- 21 votes in the Senate, 63 in the House -- of legislation  endorsed by Gov. Sam Brownback and designed to respond to a projected $400 million deficit in the fiscal year starting July 1.

The House came up with a slightly different mix of tax additions than was passed Sunday by the Senate, which required the upper chamber to vote on a bill matching the House action. That bill was in peril on Friday afternoon until Sen. Rob Olson, R-Olathe, changed his vote to "yes" and provided the ending margin.

In recent days, heavy political muscle was applied to GOP lawmakers to vote for a tax increase or face a primary election opponent in August 2016.  The Brownback administration also triggered a public backlash by declaring failure to raise taxes could result in sweeping budget reductions in Kansas higher education.

The battle to frame the tax increase in a politically palatable way erupted on the Senate and House floors.

"I view this as tax reform, not a tax hike," said Sen. Julia Lynn, an Olathe Republican who voted for the measure.

Sen. Jeff Longbine, R-Emporia, said the tax package was deficient in many ways but voted for the legislation because it might not improve if the session was prolonged. He denounced tactics used to persuade legislators to vote for revenue enhancements.

"We've had blackmail from the executive branch to the legislative branch," he said. "We've had blackmail within this body."

Brownback, in a meeting Thursday with Republicans in the House and Senate, said he was desperate to make a deal.

"I'm pleading with you, really," he said.

That GOP gathering helped inspire passage by the House of a two bills revising tax law, but likely requiring Brownback to take a knife to state spending in the next fiscal year. The chamber slipped over the hurdle around 4 a.m. Friday after hard-core conservatives who had stiff-armed leadership and the governor for weeks folded.

"Colleagues, weve had a long session, but our diligence has paid off and were making an additional $50 million in cuts to the budget," said Rep. Steve Brunk, R-Wichita. "Our goal is to enact a long-term stable and predictable revenue source to provide necessary services while protecting taxpayers pocketbooks. This bill accomplishes that.

Though dozens of Republicans ended up voting to raises taxes -- some in violation of anti-tax pledges -- some couldn't hide their displeasure.

Rep. John Whitmer, a Wichita Republican, spoke through tears as he explained his "yes" vote.

"I voted for something I am not proud of," Whitmer said, "but I feel it's what the folks need."

The legislation retained a business tax exemption Brownback delivered to 330,000 businesses in 2012, but raised the statewide sales tax to 6.5 percent from 6.15 percent on all purchases. A provision dropping the sales tax on food to 5.95  percent was withdrawn by Republicans who want to consider that adjustment in advance of the 2016 elections for House and Senate.

"It gives us the highest sales tax rate on food in the nation. Low-income people will be paying the highest rate in the nation," said Senate Minority Leader Anthony Hensley, D-Topeka. "Brownback's tax policy is Robin Hood in reverse. He steals from the poor to benefit the rich."

House Minority Leader Tom Burroughs, D-Kansas City, said Republicans were dedicated to adding $164 million to the sales tax, wiping out $97 million in itemized deductions and boosting the cigarette tax by $40 million.

"We are literally increasing the cost of living in Kansas on those who can afford it least," Burroughs said.

The plan would freeze state income tax rates at 2.7 percent and 4.6 percent through 2017, which saves the state $26  million. The deal also dropped language requiring all Kansas sales tax exemptions to expire in four years.

The session has consumed 113 days -- longest in state history and well beyond the standard 90-day session.

The break in House gridlock followed warnings by the Brownback administration that savage cuts would be made in the state university system and the state's bond ratings would collapse absent a compromise about Republicans.

Brownback and the GOP-controlled House and Senate struggled to respond to a budget deficit that trailed approval of the elimination of state income tax on limited liability companies and other businesses as well as the reduction of individual income tax rates. The bill contains a $24 million hit on these business entities, but the presumption is savvy accountants could help most owners avoid the hit.

The higher sales tax would be implemented July 1, but businesses wouldn't be obligated to assess that rate for 30 days. That could clip the state for one month of the projected revenue increase from the sales tax by $13 million.

The legislation also depends on the Kansas Department of Revenue pulling in $30 million this fall with a tax amnesty program for people who have dodge taxes.

The two bills now in play with the House and Senate would raise $384.6 million annually for the state, but a separate piece of legislation sent to Brownback would deliver $47.8 million from a new tax on managed care organizations in Kansas. </TEXT>
