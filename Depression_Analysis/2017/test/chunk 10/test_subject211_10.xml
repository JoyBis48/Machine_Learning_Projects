	<TITLE> Why do Monotheistic religions always seem to dominate over Polytheistic ones throughout the course of history? </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> It seems as though whenever there is a monotheistic religion introduced to an area it seems to dominate. We saw this in various places, such as Christianity supplanting Hellenic, Germanic, Celtic, and Slavic beliefs. We saw Islam supplanting Zoroastrian and African pagan beliefs, and we saw Judaism supplanting polytheistic beliefs in Judea. Why does this trend seem to also carry though history? As whenever Europeans colonized a new area of the world the natives seemed to usually convert very quickly. Is there a reason Monotheistic beliefs have so much more power over people? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Just because there were a lot of them doesn't mean they weren't centralized. When I say centralized I simply mean that the way the governments of those nations worked was by having a series of small scale administrators running the nation and paying nearly all of their collected taxes, men etc forward to the Emperor. Contrast that with CK2 Mechanics in which there are relatively few larger lords who take cuts of everything from taxes to levies. The closest analogue China would really have with CK2 mechanics would be having the Emperor control all of China in his demense, but due to the nature of CK2 that just wouldn't work. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Honestly the Feudal aspect is why I don't think it would work. At the time of CK2 China was operating under a centralized Empire rather than a Feudal society. The reason I don't think China would work is because they didn't even have Feudalism (at least not in the sense of Europe and the middle east) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They both do, but HIP only adds more provinces, not any new areas (There's no Persia or India either) whereas Lux Invicta expands the map to include a lot more of Africa/Asia. What I thought you were asking was where the even comes from, which is the VIET events thing (I forget the full name) which is a part of both modpacks. If you're wondering what mod OP is using in the picture, it's Lux Invicta. </TEXT>
