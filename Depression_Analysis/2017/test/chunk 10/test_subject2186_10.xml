	<TEXT> It looks like a healthy beluga to me.  They're known for being very fat (which helps with the cold) but also very flexible (which I'm sure is helpful when you have to navigate through sea ice), which gives them a smushy appearance.  Something may have happened to it that may have caused a scar to form there (certainly isn't a fresh injury), but my guess is that that's just the way this beluga's fat rolls meet when it moves its head like that.  Definitely one of the most interesting cetacean species :) </TEXT>
