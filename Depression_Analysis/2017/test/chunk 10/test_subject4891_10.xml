	<TEXT> Fuck it, done. Like I  said, third time posting here, and why? Why do I keep on going through this shit? So here I am, fucking rock bottom. Let's look at what's happened with me, shall we?
I'm running hurdles. I think I'm pretty damn good. It was my very first year, never even took interest into sports until then. I get 4th or 3rd place. I was running with the big boys too. I thought my family would be proud, but fuck no. Dad never went to my meets, for he is in the Navy. Can it get worse? With my family? Of course. Everyone compares me to my cousin. Everyone say's she's a genius in school, yet I'm the one who leads her and tutor her. I'm even compared to her in my favorite sport: Hurdles.
I'm tired of the comparison. One day, I decided I loved movies and took up a hobby known as Visual Effects. With help from people like Gleb Alexandrov, I created this: http://imgur.com/VhhuCFd
I thought my family would be so proud, but rather everyone justs says, "That's cool and all, but did you see what your cousin did in her soccer game/hurdles?"
Then there's tonight, fucking tonight. I'm currently in High School, and I'm living with my divorced mom and my sister. My family members are SJWs , so I can't talk rude to my sister despite her talking rude to me. Anyways, we are all watching tv, and being the shit service AT T Uverse is, it stops working. I offer to fix it, but I fail. I tell my family that it's just AT T being shitty. And they fucking say,"Oh stop it, AT T is cheaper. Your just being ungrateful. Besides, you only have yourself to be mad it, you thought you could program it." Program it? Are we in a fucking 4chan cringe thread? How do you program a tv? I know OpenGL and Pixar's Renderman, not whatever shitty code language AT T uses. And then my family complains that I'm always grumpy.
What the fuck do I even do at this point? This has gone on for years and years and years, we have shitloads of pills everywhere. What am I to do? </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I paint ptex in mudbox, send that over to maya. Add renderman attributes which include ptex supoort and subdivision scheme. i then go into slim, create an allpurpose material, and attack a ptex color node. I go back into maya, select my object, go into slim, right click the allpurpose material, hit assign as surface. go back into maya, choose renderman ris, hit render, and nothing but black?
  what should I do?
Also lets make this a general renderman questions thread while we are at it. </TEXT>
