	<TEXT> When I was in school, there was a group of Sorority girls that lived in a house that looked similar to a cabin. They were eventually dubbed the "Slut Cabin" by a fraternity. 

Three different sets of girls later, they still call it the Slut Cabin.

EDIT: Forgot to mention that even the girls in the Sorority called in "Slut Cabin" the name just stuck with everyone! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> [Song Meaning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance_with_the_Devil_\(Immortal_Technique_song\))

 I made myself more of a part of it when I wrote the song, and it eventually became an urban legend, and what's sick is that people thought it was about rape [when] it was really about how we are killing ourselves and destroying the most valuable resource that the Latino/Black community has: our women. </TEXT>
