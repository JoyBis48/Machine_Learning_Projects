	<TEXT> I just watched an expert on C-Span who wrote a book on The Bill of Rights.  She went back to the discussions at the time and said it was ALL about well-regulated militias and not at all about personal rights.  The militias were run by states and were designed to keep the states free of the potential tyrannical control of a central government.  http://www.c-span.org/person/?carolberkin </TEXT>

They were going to a restaurant in the Bay Area and were afraid they could nor get a cab back, so invited the driver to dine with them.  He hit it off with her friend and was asked to drive while they got in the back of the cab. If you knew my friend, you would be laughing on the floor to hear the story. </TEXT>

I would make myself known at offices of elected officials and the party you are associated with.  You could get hired as a representative or hear about a 501(C)(4) position associated with policy.  Find a new candidate, do some fundraising to pay for your salary, get your candidate elected, then start your own consulting firm.  You could start out as a political writer like Jon Ralston.  You can get government jobs.  If you are a Democrat, check out Organized Karma.   If it doesn't look like there is potential in the long-term, go to law school.

	<TEXT> I worked as a job counselor for 8 summers for a federally-subsidized Summer Youth Program where about 1,000 kids worked for nonprofits, schools, etc. for 8 weeks during the summer.  Some even worked as firefighters.  This program operated for years and Congress kept reducing it to almost nothing,  It gave young people the opportunity to see how the working world works, and many of those kids went on to become successful, productive citizens.  I think it was worth it.  They also had a short-term program for adults - and when the economy was down, more money was allocated.  You may not like it, but it keeps people in the job market, the money gets spent in the community and we all do better.  I hate this trajectory we are on.  All the money now goes to the rich in terms of tax cuts.  And contrary to what many believe, they are not necessarily the job-creators.  We subsidize the rich with their low-paying salaries through tax benefits, and in making up the difference in low-wages with welfare, food stamps and medical. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I voted yes on all three.  The legislature is unable to pass a tax to help schools.  They had time through many sessions to come up with other options.  When they don't do anything,  we have to wait another two years until they meet again.  In the meantime, nothing is done.  We have to do what they are incapable of doing.   25% of the children in the schools live in poverty.  I do not have children, but believe that all children need a good education.  Teachers also have a great investment in their education and need to be paid a decent wage also.  I believe they cannot recruit enough teachers because the starting salary is so low.  This is crazy.

Mining has not been taxed since the State created its constitution. They had lobbyists even then and wrote it into the state constitution that they be exempt from taxes.  They have had their free ride and now need to contribute to the state's wellbeing also.  

I voted for the Court of Appeals, but do not have a passion for the issue.  I just can imagine that the other courts are backed up too.  </TEXT>
