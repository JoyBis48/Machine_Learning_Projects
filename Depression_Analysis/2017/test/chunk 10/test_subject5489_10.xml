	<TEXT> Well known? Maybe. Accessible to all types of folks across socioeconomic levels (below mid-middle class [making a distinction between various levels of middle class]), I highly doubt it.

As conservative as this article is, it brings up another good point.

Poor people can't pay toll violations. Rich people can. Rich people also fund these toll road projects with investment and government subsidies.

	<TEXT> Sobriety is "not" something to promote... people that want/need to quit weed need to find out about a community somewhere...

I disagree, but completely respectfully. Addiction is scourge on our world, and people need a way out. A community does that.

As for what normies do? I could give two shits. Half my family smokes weed and they handle their shit fine. Legalize it for all I care. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So... here's one.

I take a toll road sometimes. But in order to do that, I have to sign up for a pass online. The pass has an infered signal that tracks when i use the toll road and charges me either per month, or everytime I use it. Also, I don't have to have the pass in my car. My car is registered online.

If you don't have the pass, a computer, and a debit/credit card, you kind of can't drive on the same toll road as me. There are no coin machines or employees. It's all electronic. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I used to be addicted to... and you may not believe me.... but weed.

Smoked about 5 years since turning 18. Was sloppy. Not productive. Desperate. Ended relationships, friendships, and ties with family in pursuit to get high. Almost went to jail a few times. Contemplated prostitution. Pretty familiar with CraigsList. I sadly could go on and on of the terrible decisions I made. To quote MC Chris, "Weed is by my side, it's always been there."

Been sober almost 2 years now. Sobriety isn't for everyone. It's kept me sane.

	<TEXT> Here's our story...

I had an OK cupid account, and in my bio I wrote about dog grooming/breeding and the conservation of endangered species, two things I care deeply about. So he messages me:

"Tell me about how you would groom a panda."

He's cute enough, so I do. I tell him about their habitat, their thick coats, their behavioral tendencies in capitivity, animal husbandry, etc.

He's dumbfounded and we make little banter after that.

Fast forward three weeks... I'm sitting in English class, and I see him on Scruff, but I didn't put two and two together, I hardly remember talking to him on OkCupid. We talked for days straight.

So we agreed to coffee. I looked like a disheveled mess with all my books and notebooks for school. He thought it was weird that I called him versus texting him about a change of coffee shop.

It was an awkward first date, I was head over heels for him, he was mildly interested but needed me to wow him.

We were saying our goodbyes, he said he was sure we'd just be friends until he saw me lean on my car, like in the movies. One leg on my car, one on the ground, confident. 

He asked me for a kiss right then and there. </TEXT>

I also saw roofs so thick that explosives used to not penetrate them, bomb shelters every 10 yards, 18-22 year old military members on constant patrol, fences and concretes walls not to block out the Palestinians, but to stop snipers. 

They live on the edge of oblivion for the Jewish people to have one country. One home. One place to raise a family that is their own. 

I don't know how this centuries old situation will work out, I just pray peace comes soon. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you disagree with the idea of AKC purebreds, look in to landraces and pariah dogs. They are bred for job and function, and not appearance. Bali street dogs, Canaan Shepherds, Central Asian Shepherds, Armenian Gamprs, etc.

Surprisingly, Russia is and has been on the forefront of good dog breeding in this regard. Form AND function. Not cuteness and marketability. 

These ridiculous American designer dogs and overbred AKC dogs will be the down fall of respectable dog breeding.

	<TEXT> Just brush your cat. Honestly. That's all the issue is. If the groomer sees a matt, they can shave it out.

Whether your cat is happy or not is sheer anthropomorphism. Aside from hormone levels, you'd have no idea. 

All this aside (which I am right, I see it everyday), it probably doesn't matter anymore, because your cat's coat is at this point trashed and unsalvageable, like a blonde that gets platinum hair dyed every single month. </TEXT>

Please don't get a lion cut!

Your cat is safer and better for just a bath and a blow out! They will get all the undercoat out. Plus, it's cheaper.

You cut the hair, it will never grow back the same after 2 or more haircuts.

Also you risk thyroid problems, acne, the cat getting cut; it happens. </TEXT>

I don't know how many other gay men feel this way, but you've been a huge inspiration for me through out the years. It sounds odd, I know, but you just ooze raw empowerment, and don't give no fucks. So thank you so much. You've helped me out of some dark places, and brought up the volume on some of the better times in my life.

Can you discuss some of the writing process, maybe some of the inspiration, for
your album Young Bitch. Since you've released it for free, I've been listening to the entire thing daily. Me and You is like my theme song now.

I really hope you're high as fuck right now. You got mad love coming from the Valley.
