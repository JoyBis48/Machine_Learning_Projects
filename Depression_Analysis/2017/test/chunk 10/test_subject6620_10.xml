[Here's my favorite from the playoffs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8FKbhcILWc index=15 list=PL5Ieao-D3SgZ7pDJ_iIqdYqaQK0P5rFnu) 

Couldn't find one of my favorite Sharp plays though. You guys remember when he stole the puck against the Sharks and sent a home-run pass up the ice for someone to score a breakaway? ...it was like 3 years ago.

Anyway, [here's a fight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8FKbhcILWc index=15 list=PL5Ieao-D3SgZ7pDJ_iIqdYqaQK0P5rFnu) against the Blues for good measure. 

I'm going to miss saying "That's a 2 min penalty for being too handsome" so hopefully he heads the the penalty box a few times when we see him next year in green.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Alright. Confession time here. Chris Farley died when I was in 4th grade. I told my 5 y/o brother that he got too fat for the earth to support him anymore and he caused the elevator in the John Hancock Center to fall so fast that it burst through the earth's crust, subsequently causing him to be perpetually falling until one day in the future he will break through the Earth again and re-emerge in China.

He believed this for YEARS, and would constantly ask me if he was still falling or if there was a hole in the floor of the Hancock Center that you could "see through the world." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Let's give the man a chance before we decide he isn't a good fit for this team. I, myself am very excited to see him play on the 4th line. I watched him quite a bit when he was in town with the Wolves. He is speedy, has good hands, and is Shawzian in his ability to get under people's skin. 

Many of you were flipping out at the thought of Desjardins replacing Ben Smith, and we all seem to be fine with that now. Garbutt possesses more offensive upside than Desi or Smith. 

I predict we'll get about 12-14 goals out of him this season, and while he'll make trips to the penalty box, he and Shaw will be earning us a number of power plays.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Good wishes to your family, sir or madam. While in a different point in my Mazda 3 journey, you've inspired me to write my own ode: (excuse the (no, not Nissan) stanzas for not existing)

Aspirations of high school coolness were put to the test

When I was handed the keys to a Cavalier RS

17 years of Chicago winters have must 

Caused the doors to be completely consumed by rust.

Things looked up in college you see, 

As I saved up enough for a Grand Am GT

With a badge of Ram Air and faux dual-exhaust

I destroyed the power-steering for an $800 cost

Surviving thieves, snow, winds, and ad-vers-ity

The coupe failed safety tests in the state of Vir-Ginny.

Feeling dejected, down, and just out of luck

It was sold in the shithole of Maryland for $4000 bucks!

I used public transit for 2 months or less 

Until I bought a punchless Elantra GLS.

Indeed alloy wheels and privacy glass it had,

But when obliterated by a RX350 I wasnt overwhelmingly sad.

But I enter the Mazda 3, and grabbed the wheel,

I became enthused by its unique steering feel. 

Despite its blue-eyed goofy grin, these 6-speed Mazda 3s 

Are in a class of their own with those MPGs.

	<TEXT> So many memories of this guy.

I remember watching him dominate the Wolves in the 2005 Calder Cup finals next to a young Mike Richards   Jeff Carter, and a reprehensible parasite named Jon Sim. 

Then, I remember seeing a short blurb in the back of the Sun Times' sports section saying that the Hawks traded Matt Ellison for Patrick Sharp. Exciting news for a Hawks fan who was chomping at the bit to see the next wave of "stars" like Tony Salmelainen and Pavel Vorobiev. 

Then, many years later in 2011 or 2012, my future wife and I were walking through her neighborhood of North Center, and spotted a very nice yet old fashioned couch in an alley behind a monstrosity of a new home. We decided to take the couch back to her place. I learned shortly later that Sharp had just moved into that house. Soon, the "alley couch" became the "Patrick Sharp couch." 

The rest is a blur right now with the exception of this beauty against the Preds.
