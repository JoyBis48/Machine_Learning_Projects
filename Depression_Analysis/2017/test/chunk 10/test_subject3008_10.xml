	<TEXT> I clean the ovens every other Sunday at closing. Last time, I came in and there was a well proofed pan about to be thrown out. (We throw out unused pan pizzas at close of day). I grabbed the pan and poured a little bit of butter, cinnamon, and powdered sugar all over it. Put it in the oven 1.5 times. Poured sweet icing all over it after I cut it. Let it cool. Became the physical incarnation of diabetes. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> APN issue </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-12-31 21:58:01 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I recently bought the LG G3 and the default texting app doesn't appear to let me set individual notification sounds for each contact.

I did some research and found Textra. I like Textra but when I tried to send or receive a picture message (MMS), the app is telling me it can't detect MMS settings. I'm guessing it means APN info.

I did further research and tried a few APN URLs with no luck. It's stuck, not failing or succeeding.

Does anyone here know the APN for the MMS  protocol? </TEXT>
