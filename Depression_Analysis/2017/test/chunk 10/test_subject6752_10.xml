I tried to sit for an hour before and drink coffee in Dunkin Donuts, but a stranger literally just sat down with me. I had to leave.

I feel creepy but I didn't want to be late, so here I sit for an awkward length of time.

This is My first therapy appointment since my assessment, which my wife came to. I'm nervous about being alone with my therapist.

Its really hot in My car because it's raining and I have no gas to use the AC with. </TEXT>

four sets of braces - who says their kids want them or need them?

music lessons - see above

tutors, sports team fees, gymnastic class, dance recitals - see above.

pediatrician co-pays - maybe they have great insurance

babysitters, vacations, the minivan, the driving lessons, the teenage car insurance rate hike - not needed, wants. 

four SAT prep courses, four college educations - not needed. Scholarships, grants, etc exist as does saving through summer jobs and kids who want trade school.

They will tell you you can't sleep alone

In a strange place

Then they'll tell you you can't sleep

With somebody else

Ah, but sooner or later you sleep

In your own space

Either way it's okay

	<TEXT> In your brain, you have a "map" of your body. It's the reason you can touch your nose without a mirror and why you can wipe your ass without missing a bunch of times first. This map tells you where all of your parts are. For transpeople, their map tells them that they have parts they don't and don't have parts they do. For instance, many transmen have a "phantom penis", extremely similar to phantom limp syndrome. Their brain map says that it's there, so, even though it physically isn't, they can sense it. 

Gender identity is solid, and inherent. It cannot be learned or learned away. In a case of a set of twin boys, one received a botched circumcision, so the parents chose to have him Go through sex reassignment surgery as an infant. As an adult, he transitioned back to being male, despite being raised as and told he was a girl. 

The only proven treatment for Gender Identity Disorder is transition. As I said before, gender identity can't be learned away. There is a really high suicide rate for transgender people; they face massive amounts of discrimination, are very often disowned, poor, homeless, and especially for transgender women of color, live in constant fear of being murdered. Once a person has transitioned enough for them (it varies due to cost and outlook of surgeries for what a transperson may want out of transition) that suicide rate falls. Incidentally, being prevented from transitioning makes it rise, even with counseling.

Now, I don't know if it was intentional, but you cut off the end of my remark on chromosomes being irrelevant. I specified that many intersex people (those are people who are born partially male and partially female either chromosomally or physically in appearance) do not usually stand out as being "in between". They are raised and presented as either boys or girls, most often girls because the surgery is easier and better. That shows that, unless there is a medical problem or a transition, an intersex person can live their entire lives not knowing they were intersex and strangers wouldn't know either. This goes back to gender being assigned at birth but identity being inherent. In resent times, there has been a move away from performing sex reassignment surgery on infants for any reason, including intersexism and botched circumcision because very often, the parents guess the wrong gender identity, leading to force a person into a transition they wouldn't have had to make. 

I'm not sure if you were trolling asking for more information, but if you have any other questions or if anything I said was unclear, please ask. Sorry for any typos, I wrote this on mobile. </TEXT>

As for Rachel, well race is a social construct, so how one can identify as something that isn't real I don't get, but maybe she identifies with what she stereotypes to be black culture, and I guess that's okay but making up all these bullshit lies isn't. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My mom has really bad health, and for the last three years, every trip to the doctor for her has delivered worse news. I finally have insurance and I should go, but thinking about it gives me anxiety. I think I have hypothyroidism, which my mom has, and I know the best thing is to treat it, but I don't like needles. My depression and possibly the hypothyroidism has made me obese, which I've been since childhood (I'm 20) and thinking about getting on a scale is giving me severe anxiety and I know having no choice would send me into an exhausting panic attack. Can I refuse? Should I explain on the phone first that it's a trigger for my panic attacks? Can I insist on only testing thyroid stuff with blood work? I don't have the energy to deal with anything else and the idea of more is causing me anxiety. I don't know if this is the right place, but I just wanted to know. </TEXT>

You aren't below average; just average. That's normal.

You have survived to 23, so you aren't a failure.

Your life is not the lives of those you graduated with.

23 is like 60 years more to make a change.

You know some flaws so you can change them.

You're well articulated.

You're capable of admitting to not understanding. That's a hell of a lot better than most people winging it.

Adulthood isn't having all the answers; it's being willing to look for them.

I like when it's about the messages and such, but I unsubbed when it became just cruel. I think that, along with fph and related subs, it should have been taken down.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am liking not working. My mom is very sick and physically disabled and work was the one thing I could cut out reasonably - education is paramount to me, so I'd rather struggle for money than not go to school. My job was contributing for sure. I worked as a companion to a man with Down syndrome and, while it could be rewarding and was like no real work (I actually got paid to go bowling and play in parks) it was stressful to be responsible for him especially when they stopped paying. It has helped, but it's hard to judge as, two weeks after I quit, my mom was diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver because of fatty liver disease that we didn't know she had. That's been really hard on me, but I know it would be much harder if I were working on top of it.

I am very extroverted. I love talking to people in person. I just have strong opinions and I'm sort of judgmental. I look forward to meeting new people and I want to help. I am a social work major and I want to work with mentally ill adolescents, so I will be happy to make suggestions. 

I'm very excited about school. I'm switching from community college to a university, and it's a large state school with a massive gay community (I'm butch so since I'm very visible that's important to me) and I'm hoping its a more adult atmosphere than kids screwing off in CC. 

My wife is my rock. She helps with my mom and does anything I need to help me. She is a wonderful person.

I don't feel cursed, lol. The girl's ex told me about it. I have an acquaintance who is weird about stuff like that who gave me some sage to keep in my car "just to be safe" but I don't really think she "cursed" me, at least not in any way that really affects me. 

I will certainly check that book out. I've tried talking on here about building friendships and something I learned that worked (other than the fact that I used it on someone awful) was to act like people are already your friend, and the friendship will built; that even though it's scary, you need to ask people to hang out first. Right now I'm just isolated and having a hard time finding people to build friendships with. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's my understanding; that we are all similar.

I quit working in part because of my depression and in part because my job stopped depositing my pay. My wife is on board with that decision and works more to pick up the slack so I can work on me. I haven't started group yet but the only people I really talk to are redditors and rarely conversation on Facebook. I have been told that I'm peanut butter and a lot of people are allergic to peanut butter; I don't make friends easily. I had to drop out of college this semester due to family stuff, and I am starting at a New school in August, so I'm hoping I can make friends there, but a year and a half at the first one only got me a Santaria witch that tried to put a curse on me so that wasn't great. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Don't think you don't help her; it probably just hurts that it's long distance. I'd bet a 100 bucks that it's the distance that hurts her, not you. Maybe in a year you guys can close that distance and resume. Try being friends. Without being pushy, tell her that you love her and care and are there for her in any capacity she needs you to be. Show her that you won't leave her that easy; I've noticed that women especially fear abandonment due to depression. (I'm also a woman who has this.)

Also, people can't be fixed without fixing themselves. Trying to fix someone else will never fix you. If you have health insurance or can afford to, seek counseling, even if just for a short time. I don't know the intricacies of your relationship with her, so I'm just going with what I know. Someone else may be able to help you more. 

Don't be afraid to look elsewhere for love. You may surprise yourself, but note that it's hard to love someone else when you don't love yourself, so work on you a bit before jumping right in head first. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not saying you are wrong, I just offering another point of view. Feel free to disregard.

Porn: even if you severely limit is ability to get it, he will see it. Its a world of smartphones and WiFi everywhere. Perhaps explain, instead, that porn can quickly become a dangerous addiction. Maybe offer to on-the-sly buy him magazines; they are less hardcore and not the videos that many people are hooked on. If it matters to you, explain that pornography actresses are actresses, they are real women doing not real things. You would never want your wife/mother/sister/etc to be in a situation where she was forced into it; most pornstars are such because of limited options. 

Premarital sex; I actually hope my kids have premarital sex. My mom, before my wife and I ever got married, told both of us to "try on the shoes before you buy them". She and I agree that you should be sexually compatible for the best chance at a strong marriage. We also think you should live with someone first before marriage to make sure you can live together.

Sex in your home: if he is going to have sex, he is going to. By outright disallowing it in your home, you actually put him at risk. If his partner's parents do the same, that leaves public places and a chance at arrests. My parents had an unspoken don't as don't tell policy on sex in their home. 

A big issue with religion in the modern world is that it struggles to line up with it. In a society where tinder is a thing, it's hard to expect a 16 year old kid to remain abstinent. Its hard for that kid to remain abstinent. Try to mold your beliefs around the world, where possible, and offer explanation beyond religion If you want your children to remain Christian. </TEXT>

We are gay, though, so pregnancy was never really an issue and we were both so young that we were only ever each other's sexual partner so neither were STIs. Because of all that, my parents were lax when my brother, at 16, started seeing his girlfriend. They are still together at 19, so I guess it worked out okay. </TEXT>

As you said, there has to be a cutoff and she was after said cutoff and to a point where most people would agree It's far too late to abort. I don't know if it's mentioned in this article, but the CNN story says that the boy lived for an hour before finally passing away. That's wrong, to intentionally do that. I don't think she should receive the death penalty, but she does deserve to be punished; she intentionally ended a viable life. 

Edit: apparently the charge has been dropped. http://www.wcvb.com/health/murder-charge-for-woman-who-took-abortion-pill-questioned/33501262 </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I wanted a garden really bad, for vegetables. But to get it, I had to dig out the spot of the old one and lay chicken wire and bury it all. Then I had to buy and plant plants. It was too overwhelming and I couldn't do it. Now I'm depressed that u don't have my garden. </TEXT>
