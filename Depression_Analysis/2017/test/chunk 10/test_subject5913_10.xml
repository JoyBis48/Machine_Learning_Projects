	<TEXT> Man, I plan on moving to SLC, Utah, once I having the funds. I'm a freelance artist, but since I'm not getting any work, I'm gonna have to a get a "real" job. Hearing what you said really worries me. Do you think, if I ever get a job interview, that I should lie, if I'm subtly asked about my religion and say I'm Mormon?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For me, it's all of the different sounds. For example, the droid that answers the door to Jaba's Palace, it just sounds cool! I love that different droids sorta have their own indistinguishable languages. It makes some of them sound gritty and depth to their worlds. Another sound I enjoy is when a big ship, like a cruiser, is heavily under attack, or very badly damaged, they make that sorta "arooga" sound(I hope that makes sense. That's what I hear, at least). Lastly. hearing the range of emotion in R2's beeps. 
I love it!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have very terrible anxiety issues. I honestly don't think I could handle taking a bus or riding a train, as pathetic as that sounds. That's a main reason why I'm trying to hard to get my own vehicle.  </TEXT>
