	<TEXT> See the second picture I posted.  

I have no idea how to remove the backing without busting the glass.  Should I just bust it? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Holy crap.  My brain did not even go that direction with it.  It was custom framed.  I've never seen a frame like this.  Apparently, the framer didn't want their name attached. http://imgur.com/Wkz8uIA </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Just found at the Salvation Army. Anyone know the artist or the story behind it, by chance? Aside from the obvious religious stuff lying around, I'm at a loss. It was a whole $3.99. </TITLE>

	<TEXT> I have had sleep paralysis issues for nine years now. Typically, the dreams that end with the paralysis involve something horrifying (being thrown around a room or stalked by something unseen).  Those suck.

Three nights ago, I had the first one in two years.  It was a dream within a dream within a dream.  I remember waking up twice only to find that it wasn't quite over.

I felt my hand sting.  Then it started to really hurt.  I was on my back, so I pulled my hand to my line of sight.  Expecting a cramp or my hand to have been asleep, I peered down towards my hand to find a deformed, hairless head with its mouth wrapped around my hand, up to my thumb. The body wasn't visible, and I can still remember the expressions it was making while it chomped down.

Then the paralysis!  Finally, I woke up with a yelp.  A literal yelp.  I had fallen asleep with a paintbrush in hand.  I had clenched so tightly onto it in my sleep that my hand cramped.  Weird. </TEXT>
