	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I just came home from work and a neighbour that I never met before  wanted to speak with me. He asked where has my father been because he noticed that he hasn't seen him in a while. My father died 7 months today from a four year battle with pancreatic cancer. This is the first time when someone asked where my father was and wasn't aware of his passing. It's a really horrible feeling, I've been dealing with his loss in a healthy way (getting help , finding hobbies etc), but it made me miss my dad more. The neighbour though told me when he first moved onto the street, my dad was one of the first people to greet him, it made me smile. Sometimes, curses can turn into blessings!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm so sorry for your loss. I just lost my father last December and my stupid cousin was on snap chat while we were at the cemetery and apparently took a picture. There are a lot of shmucks (idiots) out there. Since my dad's passing, I realized who were my friends and who arent. I stopped being in touch with one friend because she wouldn't seek help with her fathers death and kept on guilt tripping people and wanted attention. You are upset and honestly it's not worth it. Focus on yourself and you should find yourself new friends   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I recently went through a similar thing. My friend lost her father suddenly and is not grieving in a healthy way. She's more interested in getting a boyfriend than getting help. I stopped being friends with her because i lost my father just a few months after to cancer. She freaked out on my friend because she told her she needed help because every time the word heart or attack came up she would bring it up that it reminded her of dads death so  i knew i had to get away.

	<TEXT> Death is apart of life, everything eventually dies from plants, animals and humans. No one knows what to say until they are the ones experiencing it.  Everyone deals with it eventually, but unfortunately, some deal with death earlier than others. My father died recently on December 8, 2014 from a 4 year battle with pancreatic cancer. Besides my father being diagnosed with cancer 4 years ago in 2010, this was also the hardest day of my life. But, I can sit and cry for years on how my dad was taken away from me at the age of 21 and how he won't be there for my birthdays or my graduation in 2 years or if I walk down the aisle. My father was the one who cheered me on with school, went on ski trips with, bought technology with (phones, printers) and went to Tim Hortons so he could visit a camping store nearby. My father wasn't my best friend, but he was my mentor who I looked up to and who was my light to my darkness. I've been battling depression for a year now and it's hard, but knowing my father would want me to continue my life as it was before he died and succeed. I want to make my father proud and I will.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm very sorry, I recently just lost my father after a 4 year battle with cancer. It is not easy what you are going through, its mentally, emotionally exhausting. Every day I wish my father would walk through the door because my dad was always a fighter and when he passed it still hasn't hit me. I know that he is in a better place because seeing him in the hospital unconscious killed me. You need to associate yourself with people who will be there for you. This will be a time where you see who your real friends are. I would also recommend you see a professional, although you may think you don't need it. There's nothing wrong expressing your feelings to a professional. I like my social worker, she tells me I'm awesome. 

Keep your head up high 

It's hard I know, but you are not facing this alone  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Dear Professor, Mental Health is not a problem </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-01-20 22:15:43 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Im sitting in class listening to my professor repeatedly say mental health problems and this is not the first time I disagreed with a teacher's choice of words. I have a hearing loss and instead of the teacher saying that I have a hearing loss, she decided to use my least favourite words hearing problems.  Im trying so hard not to raise my hand as well as to rebuttal the topic. I have depression and anxiety which makes my life sometimes a little bit complicated, but I do not see it as a problem. There is a lot of stigma revolving mental health and as for someone who is trying to educate us, using problem and mental health in the same sentence is doing more harm than good. A problem is defined as something to fix and mental health cannot be fixed. There is medication as well as therapies to help assist with mental health to make it easier for the person, but it doesnt always help. The reason Im writing this is because mental health is not a problem and by saying that makes it seem that I as well as the many others have something that needs to be taken away. The topic Mental Health has been brought up in many conversations, advertisements and media outlets, but there needs to be a CHANGE on how WE talk about mental health.  </TEXT>
