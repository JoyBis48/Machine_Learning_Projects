	<TEXT> The "professional-looking dude not wearing pants" thing is sort of a comedy trope; it's been applied to news anchors, judges, etc. If either party is a woman then the under- and overtones shift too far. When it's just guys then it can work if employed advisedly. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A couple of years ago I met a recruiter at a conference and we hit it off immediately. At some point he asked me a somewhat personal question and I answered without a flinch. Then he said, "I probably also shouldn't ask this, but are you wearing panties?"

I said, "Who told you about my panties?" and he busted out laughing.

The job and I weren't right for each other, but I would have loved working with that guy. </TEXT>

Funny story: While gathering information I learned about the WELL, so I called their office (this would be about '94) and asked someone to send me an info packet. He sounded very apologetic when he said "I'll be sending this through the mail, so it will take a couple of days to reach you. Is that OK?" </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This will probably not be seen, but ... someone said something interesting to me along these lines, relating to a discussion about young people's impressions of 9/11: that we miss out on that gray area between current events and taught history that happens in our youth.

 Adults don't usually talk to kids about the news of the day, and news sources aren't usually very accessible to children. And by the time those things are set down in history books, a microgeneration has missed learning about them. Then by the time the child is adult, no other adult is going to say to them, "Let's discuss the history and context of 9/11."

My high school history classes said little about the Vietnam War, and most of what I "learned" in later years came from movies; if Hollywood hadn't mined that vein so thoroughly I probably still would be in the dark about it.* People born in the mid-1970s probably know little to nothing about the Reagan era, which was a very formative period for me. And so on. And as far as I know we don't examine these generational lacunae much, if at all.

*as opposed to mostly knowing the movie version, which is just a different form of ignorance. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What /u/spacejack_ said: Sony didn't license the Betamax format to other companies, so if you wanted a Beta player you had to buy Sony. JVC licensed the VHS format so anyone could make one, and competition pushed prices down.

For years after Betamax left the consumer market it was still in wide use in video production. Until digital video finally won out, if you saw a TV news crew on the street they probably had Betamax cameras.

The same dynamic happened between Apple and Microsoft in the 1980s; Apple's products were better in a lot of ways, but they were the only source, so for a long time they were just a niche player. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's an interesting point, that the Ferengi in DS9 were the atypical ones, which did make them interesting as characters in the context of the series. But every time the setting shifted to Ferengenar it was just painful. I get that they wanted Quark and Rom to have some sort of depth and character arcs, but this just seemed farcical and didn't really respect them. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Very much agreed. I thought new-BSG was what Voyager should have been. And their resources were actually nearly unlimited -- "We have a full complement of shuttles." Really? They keep getting destroyed and you just replicate more?

I also thought Year of Hell would have made a great Doctor Who arc with the payoff happening by design instead of accidentally. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Can sort of confirm. I once was stuck at the airport when my flight was delayed and finally canceled till the next day. The only hotel with a room was a Marriott ("When You're Stuck At The Airport, You're Stuck With Us"), and the nice desk person seemed to really really not want to charge me the full rate, but I didn't have anything that gave a discount (no AAA etc.). Clearly she had virtually no flexibility from the bosses. She did comp my breakfast buffet the next morning, I guess that counts as an upgrade.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Eh. I've taken Greyhound a lot, and I have no horror stories. My fellow passengers have tended to be among the downtrodden, but they have generally been nice folks. The main problems have been with the bus itself -- breaking down, running late, etc. And that doesn't happen all that often.

Now, I finally quit taking the bus once when I traveled to Nebraska in December and a blizzard hit the entire Great Plains; I had to stay days longer than I had planned because even after the roads were cleared, the "upstream" highways were still closed and the buses couldn't get there.

I still take the bus for short hops, like NYC-DC. </TEXT>
