	<TEXT> She has a very out dated macbook '09 era. I've been looking at new ones for her and I'm confused as to why a: the new macbook pro's have dual core processors and b: why is the processing power around 1.2ghz? What sort of windows laptop would be comparable? Since she is required to have a mac, what ( in your opinion ) would pose the best value?
Thanks, and many apologies for posting in the master race. You guys would have a much greater knowledge than that of other subs. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I, normally, am serving at the waitress well of the bar I work at and continually have a line of regulars (mostly good, some bad) that will wait their turn because I give respect to each and every customer and, as much as possible, speedy service. I can't remember most of their names but I know exactly what they drink. </TEXT>
