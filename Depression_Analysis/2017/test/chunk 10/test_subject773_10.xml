Really good product.  I got measured locally and then boots magically came!  They can tell you where to get measured near you.  http://dehner.com/ </TEXT>

	<TEXT> "In our constitution there are many rights: the right to housing, the right to education, the right to health. But I don't find the right to park." -  Enrique Pealosa, former mayor of Bogota, Colombia

People act like parking is some kind of right they have wherever they go, and if it isn't available there needs to be an "improvement." I, however, see removing parking as an improvement.   </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2015-03-26 15:27:40 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi everyone.  I have a little side business called Bling for the Ring that sells vintage stock pins and lapel pins, offering riders something unique to accessorize with.  I sell primarily in the Morgan and Saddlebred world, since those are the breeds I show with, but would love to tap into the Hunter/Jumper, Dressage, and Arab worlds.  

Does anyone know of any message boards where I could post, facebook pages I could like, or any other ways to reach out to these disciplines/breeds?  I have an Etsy page and can ship internationally, so the sky's the limit!!!  

Any help would be great.  If you're curious about what I'm selling, my Etsy page is here: https://www.etsy.com/shop/blingforthering

Thank you all in advance! </TEXT>
