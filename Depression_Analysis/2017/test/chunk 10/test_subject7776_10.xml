	<TEXT> Fuck yeah, I have experience to comment! Where I worked, the franchise paid minimum wage to drivers (8.05) but after a checklist, you'd get a 50 cent raise (8.55) we made 5% on all deliveries, and only delivered 5-8 mins from the store. Not all that bad, can quickly get deliveries since it's all fast-paced, meaning I could do 12 deliveries in a few hours with 3 other drivers (this was at a slow store) so I'd come home with 30-50 bucks for a few hours of driving. (Though I had a V8 and got 13mpg so it all went to my tank) I wouldn't do it again. Not with my car. Management was good, but I rubbed them the wrong way once and got fired. Oh yeah, and the daily beatifications suck dick. There's a list of things that NEED to be done before the day is over and basically only drivers can do it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ex-Sonic Employee here:
Mine has done this too, You probably were in the Employee restroom, (Which has an entrance from inside the store, and the outside.) We can't fit all the buns in one room so we'd put them in the restroom that no one is suppose to be in, until we could move stuff around and fit them, or the bread man would take them back on his truck. They're usually there for maybe 2 hours tops.

You probably were in the restroom you shouldn't have been, and no one uses it, at least at my old store, whilst food is in.
Plus that restroom looks clean af.

	<TEXT> Hey guys, I haven't done a give-away in a long long time, so I figure I might as well with the new update!
[It, as of this moment of posting, is worth about 4$](http://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/730/StatTrak%E2%84%A2%20USP-S%20%7C%20Torque%20%28Field-Tested%29)
[This is my profile.](http://steamcommunity.com/id/test_subject7776) Comment a number between 1-1000 and I'll pick a winner tomorrow around 6pm Mountain time.
Thanks guys! Have a good one.
EDIT: I just realized that since I unboxed it, I can't trade it ASAP, so I will add the winner and trade you on the 3rd of June (1 week from now) That is my fault, I'm sorry.

	<TEXT> I hate when people don't go with reputable exhausts, cause that shit can sound either good, or dog shit. I looked at so many catbacks before getting ATAKs, I was considering Flows or Magnas, but Borla just suits it.
I got mine from CJ Pony Parts, But both AM and CJ hiked the ATAK price up.. :( 847$ is a bit much. 800$ is O.K. I have a discount from a Mustang Club I'm in, so I got it for 760$. </TEXT>
