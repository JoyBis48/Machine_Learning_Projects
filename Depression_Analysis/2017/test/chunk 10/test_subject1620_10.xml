	<TEXT> I finished reading Matterhorn last week. I tried to start Dune yesterday which I had been meaning to read for a long time, I had to put it down though. It's almost like I'm feeling too emotionally connected to Matterhorn to the point that I'm still dreaming about it, that I can't immerse myself in a different story yet. Has anyone ever experienced something like this? What book did it for you? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think I was maybe 3 at the time. I remember my babysitter giving me a bath before jumping out of the tub, running down the hall to my parents' room, and pooping on the floor. Then laughing a lot.

Not sure if this actually happened... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> hmmm, I can't think of any exercise in particular that would bother me. As I said before, I lift 3x a week (MWF) and run between 3-5 miles 3x a week on the other days.

Make sure to hydrate when you exercise, especially as the weather gets warmer.

Wish I had more insight into your specific problem </TEXT>
