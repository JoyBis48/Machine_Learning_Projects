	<TEXT>  Yes, some episodes in the novel read like science fiction and the title seems a sly allusion to the H G Well's classic. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Your reference to Disney's cultural free-riding suggests to me that the most profitable resources to plunder are the works and lives of others. Antarctica would be a new frontier, as are the moon and stars, but capitalism thrived by assimilating the worth and exploiting the weakness of pre-existing populations and cultures. For centuries, it has tapped the labor of people held in Malthusian traps. The trans-Atlantic slave trade and the Opium Wars -- now that is disruption. What would the patents to maize, potatoes and tobacco be worth to Monsanto? As we race to the bottom of a depleted well, I imagine there is still a lot to 'go-and-get'. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You are correct about its layers of meaning, and the details you provided show you read it with a keener critical eye than mine.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In E. O. Wilson's most recent book, The Meaning of Human Existence, he asserts that intelligent ET's should exist, certainly within 100 light years, but such complex biological entities are too fragile for sustained existence in space  -- as are we. He also suggests we, and other such beings, might reject the trans-biological adaption that is necessary to for such exploration -- Trans-humanism is human extinction. Only robotic technology can every leave its planetary home.

I do not understand why we would not discover the prior electro-magnetic (or other) signature of an galactic civilization well ahead of its advancing wave front. Surely, that signature would have arrived at least centuries ago. Perhaps, someone can provide a simplified and explanatory reference. Also, this VX Junkies reddit is a parody, right? For an aged, aged man, it is become difficult to distinguish parody from reality. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you. I will place this book on my reading list.

The mass of any society might prefer stasis, if it were comfortable enough. Those of conservative temperament, in the cultural sense, should be its natural advocate -- their 'good old days' would be more permanent. Likewise, this would tend to perpetuate existing, hereditary elites. That is the downside. In contrast, Capitalism has always been to the disproportionate benefit of a would-be elite, one that is always willing to sell-out tradition and their fellows for advancement. These go-getting 'disruptors' view themselves as agents of 'progress', in multifarious forms, but ultimately, they can only accelerate an increase in global entropy. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was tempted to refute your assertion about the sustainability of Japanese society prior to American intervention, by which I assume you mean Admiral Perry and his Black Ships, in 1853. However, I first consulted this Wikipedia article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographic_history_of_Japan_before_Meiji_Restoration#Total_population_2
and found that Japan had undergone a long period of population stasis. This is an interesting topic for discussion, especially with current Japanese demographic trends. Could you, or others, offer sources for further inquiry? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My vote for the heaviest McCarthy quote comes from the mouth of his classic sociopath, Anton Chigurh: "If the rule you followed brought you to this, of what use was the rule?"
That may be inexact, as I have no copy before me, but it is a grim formula that can be applied to too many of life's outcomes. </TEXT>
