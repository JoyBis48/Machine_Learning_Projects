	<TEXT> Basic recipe:

Slice an eggplant into ~1/2 inch rounds. 

Lay the rounds on a couple layers of paper towels, liberally salt both sides, cover with a couple more layers of paper towels, and let sit for at least an hour.

After some liquid is drained off, rinse the rounds.

Dip the rounds in beaten egg and then a combination of corn meal, shredded parmesan, garlic powder, and pepper.

Place rounds in greased pans, then into a 350 F oven for ~10 minutes, flipping once, so they get crispy.

In (ideally) a 13x9 baking pan, layer tomato sauce, eggplant, parm, and slices of mozzarella until you've used all your supplies.

Bake in 350 F oven for 25-35 minutes, until eggplant is cooked through and cheese is melty and browned.

Notes:

I used corn meal because my partner in crime has Celiac, so we try to be gluten free.

I used my Dutch oven because I don't have a 13x9 pan, but it was still wonderful.

Making your own tomato sauce would make this even better, but funds and time meant we had to use store bought. Garlic and herb would be great, but we used 4 cheese.

Next time I'd add some herbs, but it slipped my mind.

Edit: I never measure, but about half a block of each type of cheese was used, and we only used one big eggplant. It put 3 of us into food comas. </TEXT>

He moved in last August. He's in the complex across the alley from me. We've been flirting for a year. He's living there again next year.

I've left notes on his door and we've hung out a few times. He knocked on my door yesterday after I left a note and then was too scared to face him for a week. I'm freaking out because he actually wants to get drinks on Saturday, but I'm broke. And I think I'm in love with him. And I have no idea what to do. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It looks like you're increasing too fast. You can't add too many increases in each round. Sadly, I think you will have to frog, but not too far.

Best way to make a flat circle (at least that I've found) is to decrease the number of increases per round by 1, if that makes sense. Like, first round, increase in each stitch, then every other, then every third, etc etc. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Chips were just thick cut and baked with salt and pepper.

Fish was fairly cheap tilapia coated in tapioca flour, salt, and pepper, then deep fried.

Tapioca flour works really well for fried things. We used it because my partner in crime has Celiac. We just had lemon juice and ketchup with it, because I don't like tartar sauce and she isn't a fan of malt vinegar. Next time we will definitely be trying mushy peas to be traditional, this time one of the people for whom we cooked is a pea hating heathen (but I love her). </TEXT>

If they weren't round enough, you can trim each strand to work. If they fell apart, get a friend to help make sure the knot is tight enough, and triple knot at least. If they look like a bunch of strands tied together instead of a pompom, wrap the yarn around a few more times. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Basic recipe. I know it isn't at all traditional, but I'm a poor college kid.

Ingredients:

Pork loin

Dry rub (we used salt, pepper, cayenne, garlic powder, and onion powder)

1 bottle hard cider (we used Harpoon, but anything that is a bit sweet will work)

BBQ sauce

Instructions:

Rub your meat down with your rub, let sit for at least 30 minutes.

Pre heat oven to ~190F.

Put meat in a Dutch oven. Pour cider all over and around meat.

Cook, partially covered, until the internal temp is around 150. This took us around 6 hours.

About 2.5-3 hours in, start basting the meat with the cider that's in the pan every 30 minutes.

About 90 minutes before the meat is done, take the cover off and start basting with BBQ sauce every 15-20 minutes.

Take meat out of Dutch oven, let rest for at least 30 minutes. Then, shred with two forks.

Since we used a loin, we had to simmer the shredded meat and extra fat in about half of the braising liquid and some more sauce for 45 minutes to make it moist.

Serve on buns with whatever sides you want. We had mac and cheese and corn on the cob. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I brewed random herbs into tea all growing up, since my mom is an avid gardener.

Monarda didyma, with the beautiful deep red flowers was a favorite of mine. It really worked with lavender, too. Lemongrass also makes a great infusion. Straight lavender or chamomile are also good, and exploring all the different varieties of mint is a great starting point (chocolate mint and peppermint are my favorites).

Edit: these all grow very well in Southern Indiana. I always just plucked Monarda flowers and boiled them in water for a few minutes, although I'm sure drying them would make the flavor more intense. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm just getting into tea. I got my first stove top kettle yesterday, and will be getting an infuser soon.

How important is water temperature? And how can you tell that your water is the right temperature (I can only tell "cold," "almost boiling," and "boiling")?
 
Right now I only have a couple black teas (Earl Grey and a ginger peach flavor) and a couple herbal "teas" (chamomile and peppermint), all in bags.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm also new here, but I'd say ask. My favorite tea to ice is Bigelow Constant Comment, which is black tea with orange and cloves and other spices. It's the only tea I prefer with sugar, and it makes the best sweet iced tea.

	<TEXT> Background: I got about a foot cut off last night. I'm growing out the bangs I've religiously trimmed every 2 weeks for 3 years. 

I've been dying my hair with henna for just shy of 8 years, but am looking for a color change. I know that red suits me, even though my natural color is the definition of mousy brown. I haven't ever bleached my hair, and have only dyed it unnatural colors twice (all purple about 11 years ago, navy blue tips about a year after), but wanna go crazy, since I'm graduating college next May.

I'm sorry if this isn't the best picture, but I only have my phone. </TEXT>
