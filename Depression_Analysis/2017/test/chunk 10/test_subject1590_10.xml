	<TEXT> I think this is a really good offer, tbh. Their valuation is at 4MM, which means they've probably raised a seed round of ~1MM (my guess), and they are willing to offer 100k + bonus. This is a really good sign.

Equity wise, I think 1.7% for the 10th hire is also very very decent. </TEXT>

APM466 - Luis Seco's tests follow his notes online, while his lectures are basically like blah blah blah, so you certainly can skip one hour. He usually starts like around 9:20 anyway.

STA457 - I believe Keith is teaching this year. He has really good notes, so if you have a friend taking notes for you, then you are good to go. </TEXT>
