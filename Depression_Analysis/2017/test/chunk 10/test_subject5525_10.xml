	<TEXT> Seconding the opinion to keep going. It starts rather slow with Frannie and Harolds story, and the beginning of Larry Underwoods story there at the beginning...but it is necessary to their character development later in the story. 

Are you reading the unabridged version? That might have something to do with the slow pace at the beginning...The Stand is one of my favorite of King's; it's absolutely worth reading. Stick with it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Two things: 

First, wrong sub. 

Second, a record only has one groove. The needle travels from beginning to end, reproducing sound (or lack of) along the way. The groove has variations that are transmitted via the record needle as sound waves; this is the music. So, to answer your question, you could theoretically have a record big enough to contain one groove that could have a combination of all the sound ever recorded or to be recorded, but it would be bigger than the universe itself.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Life with Penis 101...lol

I wouldn't want to run without securing myself up a bit...usually with some tighter underwear or when I sport heavily, with a jock strap. (Though I have heard some distance runners like to go without undies at all...*shudder). I am aware of it being there when I'm running or sporting, but no more so than say my nipples. Or my ears.

If I'm in a pool *naked* then yes it sort of floats around. Otherwise it's in the netting you find in most boardshorts/swimwear. It's there for a reason.

Lol...I don't feel the need to pee in my dick. It's in my bladder. Though I can feel my urethra opening up when I pee, especially in the morning...it's not entirely unpleasant.

When I ejaculate, the orgasm sensation is a whole body thing that sort of radiates from my penis, but I am aware of my ejaculate making its way through my urethra, yes.

Occasionally I am aware of my penis growing or shrinking, but not really...it does that through the day. Usually its just a bit of annoyance, I have to readjust myself and I can't always do that in public. The only time I'm surprised by an erection is morning wood, but not even a surprise really, as I expect that...I'm just not aware of it happening. (I've read somewhere that a man gets 6-10 erections a night, something to do with bloodflow IIRC)

Fun Penis Fact: The wrong bike seat can cause your penis to "fall asleep"! Especially on long bike rides...pins and needles are equally pleasant and the Worst. Thing. Ever.

	<TEXT> Water hazards are part of the game. You just have to approach them with your skill set in mind. On my home course, there is a lake on the 18th, and its about 250' from the pad. Depending on wind, sometimes I go over, sometimes I drop a placement shot on the shore and take par. It's a good practice in shot shaping and shot selection. Not every hazard has to be bullied through; sometimes finesse is the answer. Share that. Also, lost plastic is the excuse for new plastic! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 1. You like cooking chicken thighs, but you make the same thing every time? Try something new. Much of cooking is trial and error, and experience. Look up recipes online and try them. Try different cooking methods; bake them, simmer them in a sauce, slow cook them a crock pot, deep fry 'em. Keep notes of what you like and don't.

2. Shopping should become about staples. (Food staples are the things that I would expect to find in every kitchen: sugar, flour, rice, etc.) Expand on your staples to include different types of the same food. Buy in bulk when appropriate. Over time you will build a kitchen with the goal being that when you want to try a new recipe, you only have to buy one or two ingredients, if that. With most of your staples handled, most (simpler) recipes should be made with ingredients you already have.

3. Practice. There are tons of easy recipes out there, find ones that interest  you and try them. If you're interested in becoming a better cook, look for recipes that feature one (or two) ingredients you haven't worked with before and one (or two) cooking or prepping methods that you haven't done before. Once you learn a skill, you can apply that skill to other recipes. The internet is your friend, but if you prefer the paper cookbooks, pick up a copy of Joy of Cooking; it's still the best all-around cookbook out there. Covers everything from appetizers to desserts, but plenty of information beyond and behind the recipe...gives you some of the *why* of food, not just the *how*. 

Happy cooking. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> [Google the Fermi Paradox](https://www.google.com/search?q=theory+of+life+on+other+planets ie=utf-8 oe=utf-8#q=the+fermi+paradox)...it talks about the apparent high probability of life on other worlds and the incredible lack of evidence of any life on other worlds. It's too heavy to get into here, but one of the neat things about Fermi's equation is the quantifying of Time.

Think about just how incredibly big the Universe is. Even if other life forms had some sort of faster than light drive, Time would still be a huge factor. Maybe we're the first in an timeline of life that will stretch for millenia...or perhaps we're the last folks on that timeline. It may be that the Universe just absolutely teems with life...but at sufficient distances that travel between them is near impossible...or long enough that by the time we get there (or they get here) that civilization is long gone, and turned to dust.

Dig into Fermi's theory. It's an interesting thought experiment, and it helped me begin to understand just how freakin' big the Universe is, and that big means...time, not just size. </TEXT>

Most of the time this is not a "formality" interview, but more like the other managers winnow through the other applicants, and bring in a few for the GM to choose from. If the job is in the US, you more than likely will be only offered server minimum, so no negotiation there, but do ask, it looks intelligent. You may know that you have the job at the end of the interview, or it may be a follow-up phone call situation. If you don't hear from them in a week or so, give them a call. Once. Just once.  Good luck!

	<TEXT> I've lived in both cities. I like them both. If the urban sprawl of Orlando is not your thing, you're not going to like the Tampa area. It's very much like the Orlando metro area. But Tampa has a vibrant music and art scene, and there are quiet places to find in the surrounding area. I grew up in Pinellas Park area, and the Gulf beaches are awesome, and all the the littler cities along the gulf are kinda chill. Not a lot of wide open green spaces though...
I think I prefer Tally. Great music scene, lots of art and events, but it still has a little bit of a smaller town feel. It's neat to experience the ebb and flow of the city as well. It's a totally different city when all the students and all the legislators are in town, and in the summer it just gets quiet. Making friends in Tally could be a little more difficult than in Tampa, because of that ebb and flow. You'll meet lots of folks that are only there for four years or so. Tampa area safety is going to be a lot like Orlando. It's a toss up whether I'd feel safer on the OBT or on Ashley Street at 2 in the morning. Tallahassee is kinda weird in that while it does have a "wrong side of town", it also is very mixed. You have sort of rough neighborhoods in the same area as nicer places, restaurant row is two blocks from skid row, the homeless shelter is right down the road from all the best bars and clubs. High crime for a city its size, but mostly because of the youth of the city. Average age is way lower in Tally than in the Tampa metro area.  </TEXT>

It's easy if you're taking care of the same 15 people at a small downtown craft-beer heavy bar, but a full-size restaurant in a tourist town is a strange animal. I see my locals, and I talk to them, but most of our cheddar comes from visitors. I have no idea what's hot in the Carolinas right now (where many of my visitors are coming from), in a few months I start getting GA, MS, AL people, and who knows what they want? They often don't know themselves!  Then my yankees, and soon after, my Canadians. It's not just my beer selection to consider, either...I also have to be concerned about liquor and wine, not to mention my menu at large. A lot of it is just guesswork. We listen to requests, but I tell you more often than not, one guy drinks that wine/beer/liquor, and it sits on my shelf. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> These are all valid points, but going into July-August, I'm stuck with the tourist trade. In this town, that means folks from the Carolinas and mid-florida. I try to keep a few classier beers around for the folks that like to drink Beer (not beer), but I rotate a bottle selection and a tap each two-month period. Right now I have an empty tap, and running down our Small Town's Not Your Fathers Root Beer. What I'm looking to do is have an option where I can coax another buck or two out of those people that are going to want a Bud or a Miller or a  Busch...something light, something yellow, something American...but also something that can benefit those customers that don't want boring beers. Tough call I know. As we get past July-August, my customer base, for lack of a better way of putting it, gets a little "classier", and then I can focus on trending beers, and higher price points, but I have to get through the rest of summer first. 

Though good suggestion on Beer Dinner though...I had debated on doing a prie-fix menu option on the weekends, it would be nice to offer a pairing with wine and one with beer. Thanks for that. </TEXT>

We just featured Small Town's Not Your Fathers Root Beer (American ale, 5.9%abv, tastes like frekin' root beer. We do a float with vanilla ice cream and Absolut Vanilla Vodka whipped cream. Yum!) Maybe that's something that might work for us. I'll check my distributors and see. </TEXT>

Trying to change that for the better. (This month has been Small Town's Not Your Fathers Root Beer. Sold like a barn afire.) </TEXT>

I've eliminated anything summer fruity like Shandys and Ciders, and looking to hit a price point about a buck more than Bud, Miller, Coors, etc. Any ideas? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Lol...not all of us do. Mostly I think it's the disconnect in the way people relate to the restaurant. We train our servers to think that the most important thing in the restaurant are the people in their section; they must take care of them at all costs, and we train our chefs and cooks that they are responsible for the entire restaurant at any given time, at least when it comes to food. In that situation you have servers focused on getting a side of whatever for one of their six customers while the kitchen is taking care of 144 guests on the rail...it can get frustrating, and there's little understanding of the other positions plight.

	<TEXT> Hard to talk about this without spoiling some stuff for you. 

HIA is two novellas and three short stories. They are all interconnected. 

There is a major character that you need to meet. He figures heavily in one of the novellas, but he also influences some of the things that happen in the other novella and two of the short stories. (Debateable, but yeah) This character is important in the last short story, with another tie-in to the dark tower. (It is not a necessary tie-in, but more of an "a-ha" moment when you achieve resolution with that character.)

So short answer? Read it. Low Men in Yellow Coats, the first novella is a must. Read the rest, because they're good, and connected to LMIYC. Read the last short story for what appears to be a mystery, that later is resolved in the DT series. 

But, that's just, like, my opinion, man. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Restaurant chef/manager here. Hot, standing, bending, running, all damn day long.

1. Shower. Every day before work. (After work too, if you're gross.)
2. Dry dem nuts. Don't dress over wet.
3. Clean clothes. Every time.
4. Some powder. Doesn't seem to matter which kind. I swear by just simple plain corn starch. Others have an unholy fascination with Gold Bond. Try a few, find one you like. Use it, everyday.
5. When you get home,  clean up. Don't go to bed greasy or sweaty. Let that area air out, don't lock everything up in tight whiteys when you get home, get some baggy boxers, and let em breathe, son. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Don't be swayed; do your research. Dirty is a myth. Uncut is the normal. Google will be your friend...but be advised, my wife and I got wrong information from doctors! 

Here's what I remember:

There is a small decrease in the transmission of some STIs...but it is a small percentage, easily mitigated with the use of condoms, which you would be hopefully teaching, and he will hopefully be using.

The increase in UTIs is real in cut vs uncut...but would you cut  your ear off just to keep it clean? The difficulty for us has just been education our son about how to keep himself clean, and really hasn't been a problem for us.

The cut vs uncut "normal" argument? Well, if he decides later in life, he can certainly elect to get a circumcision while it's quite a bit more difficult to regrow (stretch and cover; google it, it's horrific) his foreskin.

Having a foreskin does have its benefits. Besides being the norm for our body design, it increases sexual pleasure and increases sexual response, both good things for your adult son.

The main thing to remember is that this is a decision between you and your SO. Not friends, not family members, not neighbors. My wife and I are happy with the decision to not circumcise our son, and have had no problems with that, at all, period.  </TEXT>

[Mockingbirds](http://animals.nationalgeographic.com/animals/birding/northern-mockingbird/) aren't just making random noises, they are mimicking other bird species. There has been proof in the past that mockingbirds don't just learn from the birds around them either; they learn from other mockingbirds...there have been incidences of mockingbirds mimicking the calls of extinct birds!

	<TEXT> My god, man. I'm so sorry. Persephonee seems like a wonderful girl, I bet she would be so proud of you for deciding to help other people during this time. My heart is just broken for you, bro, just broke. 

I hope you don't mind I share one of your posts from [www.caringbridge.com](http://www.caringbridge.org/visit/persephoneebanks/journal/view/id/54ec56f7a589b4c14e96b3d7) that gives some history. I'm sure others want to know, and maybe want to help out too.

Stay strong, man. From what I read in the Journal on CB, I can't believe how strong you're being; probably strong enough that you and Persephonee's mom can hold each other up, and help each other through this. Far stronger than I can imagine myself being...

This is where I would put something that would help you feel better, if I knew at all what to say... </TEXT>
