	<TEXT> Bad prose: E.L James, Stephanie Meyer, a fair portion of contemporary YA fiction. 

Good prose: Most any classic, Stoner^^^1, McEwan, Never Let Me Go^^^2, The Kingkiller Chronicles^^^3.

(A lot of these are maybe somewhat opinion but I think in the most, they hold up)

1. By John Williams (Not the composer). *Read it!*

2. By Kazuo Ishiguro. *Read it!*

	<TEXT> Yeah. I thought it was pretty obvious (with the new look) that it would be a different Joker origin. Nolan didn't quite go with canon anyway for Ledger. And then WB put a new spin on Leto's joker with an alternative origin. 

They pretty much had to do that, though. So it wasn't so similar to Ledger/Nolan. And so it fit in with the comic-book arc.  </TEXT>

I don't mind that they're doing something different with him. And I don't blame them for taking steps to differentiate between the last incarnation so recently after it.

	<TEXT> Compared to some of the more recent trailers, it feels like SS and BvS have been very bare. I know SS is more of a teaser, so we'll have to wait and see on that one but so far so good.

The spray paint on Superman for felt like it was just putting the audience into the right point within the film - so we know how that film-universe feels about Superman. The God imagery did get a bit too much in Man of Steel, so I do hope they tone down in this one. Especially with all of the controversy about him.

My feelings with the Joker is that it's too conscientiously different from Ledger's. They've looked at how Nolan does it and then contrived to go in as far the opposite direction as possible. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Isn't Aquaman in it too? Whoop! 

I understand what you mean about Superman and his motives. But to me it looks like it really will be Batman attacking and Superman defending. Then, when humanity turns on him, he might just take it all out on Batman, who is kinda provoking him, and kick his ass. 

I never really had a fault with Man of Steel. The whole reason to side against Zod was so as not to doom an entire race. That makes sense. So now that he's saved Earth, the humans turn on him, and Batman is at the forefront of that. That feels like Superman's motivations to me.

I'm just excited to see how it goes in with the Suicide Squad, and the Joker. Well, not just excited. Also excited. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think McEwan's longer novels aren't as good as his shorter ones (except *The Children Act*). So I liked *The Cement Garden* and *On Chesil Beach* a fair bit more than *Atonement*. I think *Sweet Tooth* is the exception to that rule, because I quite liked that, a touch more than Atonement. I couldn't even finish *Solar*, but I might come back to that one now I'm a bit older.

All this stuff about the Chandrian, and Mr. Ash, and whether or not Denna is one of the Chandrian; there is some pretty good theories about all of these but I don't remember them. </TEXT>

But the thing is for every game there's another hundred guys trying to break into the industry. For every game another dozen never get finished.

Learn a skill, make yourself stand out. You have to do something. Programming. Art. A lot of indie studios take on writers now. Look into it. It's something you can do as a hobby on the side. Learn Unity or Unreal Engine. Practice making your own stuff. It's difficult. Hella difficult. I failed at it. But, hey, who said dreams ought to be easy? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The thing about DC is that it absolutely feels like their shoe-horning characters together to compete with The Avengers. That might not be the case. But a film with introducing a new Batman, Wonder-Woman and Aquaman might be a bit much.

As for the suicide squad...the entire trailer felt like just a frame to introduce The Joker at the end. There was nothing else to it. A few character snaps and then Leto. And my concern for Leto's Joker is that it's possibly going to be based mainly on ensuring that it isn't like Ledger's uber-succesful one. This isn't a criticism of the film, just that trailer. There's also no way that we can see as much of the characters SS as we would want to. So some are going to get left behind.

And I like that DC are being more gritty. I love the MCU but I'm really dying to see something else. </TEXT>

The man wakes. Alert. Something had woken him. He looks over to the empty space beside him and sees his wife his missing. He grabs the knife from under his pillow and looks around his room.

Real-long sentence. Also, he looks over to his wife, who isn't there, so he can't look over to his wife.
