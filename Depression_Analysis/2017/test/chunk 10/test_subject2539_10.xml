	<TEXT> For some reason scenes from "The Painter" by Peter Heller always come to my mind. I'll be driving or something and I'll just think back on this book. I've read dozens of books after it, most were more memorable, yet I still think back on it. It's a good book, don't get me wrong but it shouldn't have stuck with me.

I hung out at my friends house for a bit and on the way home there was a lot more cars, around 2 am, so a lot of people were watching this fight. Movie was awesome btw. The reviews made me lower my expectations, and I wasn't blown away, but it was a great 2.5 hours. Better than furious 7 </TEXT>

Questions: Can you afford college?

What job would you like in the military?

What degree would you persue in college?

Do you know about the GI Bill? </TEXT>
