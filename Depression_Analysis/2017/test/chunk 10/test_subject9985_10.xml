	<TEXT> I think that if you want further guidance that is written in a more accessible way you should read The Untethered Soul. It really put forward these concepts in a way I could relate to, as I found that Tolle comes across as a little bit too "out there".

If I could sum it up in one sentence, try to be the attention but not the judgement.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey I think I have the perfect solution for you. I literally just finished this men's 30 day yoga challenge yesterday and absolutely loved it. It's only ~10 minutes a day and now I'm just excited to do more!

	<TEXT> Hey FluffleUffle,

I've had a similar experience before where I thought a symptom was a bad sign, by worrying about it I became hyper-vigilant and much more aware of even the slightest sensation. 

Headaches and anxiety go hand in hand - you probably don't realise but your anxiety makes your whole body cave in and hunch. This includes your shoulders, head and neck. Try and become aware of any tension you are holding as it is not uncommon for anxiety to cause tension headaches, which in turn feeds the anxiety.

Have you given any consideration to trying mindfulness? This might help you become more aware of these processes and help you to prevent them before they get to the point where you get a headache.

Personally I ruined three months of my life thinking I had cancer. When I finally found out that I was completely healthy I was angry at myself for wasting so much of my time being miserable. Go to the doctor if you think this one-off reassurance will help you. But don't let the Doctor's reassurance become a crutch.

Good luck, you can do it :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yep there's always going to be a physical component to anxiety. I'd recommend trying some relaxation techniques to counteract it. Letting yourself get tense makes the anxiety worse and causes a sort of feedback loop. Letting yourself relax will have the opposite effect.

The mind affects the body but the body can affect the mind too.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I know that a couple of supermarkets got in trouble a few months ago for selling multipacks that were more expensive than buying the items individually, so there must be someone out there with a desire for justice. And savings. </TEXT>
