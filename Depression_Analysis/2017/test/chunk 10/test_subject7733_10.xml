	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I understood all the America satire that Vonnegut was using, but am I wrong to think that it was really long-winded? After reading the 300 page book, I couldn't help but think that it could have been 150 pages. I want to read more Vonnegut, but I don't know if it's going to be more of the same or not. I read a brief description of Cat's Cradle and Slaughterhouse-five and they both sounded like American Satires, PLEASE CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG.


I would like to know if I should keep on going, or maybe I missed something completely with the book that went over my head. </TEXT>

It says that it has similarities to Alice In Wonderland. How pivotal is that to the enjoyment of the story? Because I have never read/watched Alice In Wonderland. I've read Graveyard Book by Neil, even though I never read Jungle Book. Will there be any issues? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I always love that during Gilmour's solos when he doesn't play a lot of notes I succession, but he has them long and strung out. Most notably in Time and the 2nd solo in Comfortably Numb. He also does it in echoes. I love guitar solos in that fashion, also explains why Wet Sand by RHCP is one of my favorite songs ever. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I love it! I feel like more people are against it than like it. There are a few shitty lyrics like "let's go do it" and the parts that sound like that. But the rest is catchy and fun to sing to. The chorus gets stuck in my head like a bug.

Also, I guess this "technically" the first post-Floyd solo album. Obviously the argument could be made and roger and yada yada yada. But it's just a thought. </TEXT>

That being said. As I was reading through Rand Paul's book, "Taking A Stand" he referenced Pink Floyd and I thought it might be cool to share with you guys.

 Pink Floyd understood that genius needs to be left alone. Whether your ideas are politically correct or not, whether you're a painter or self-proclaimed prophet, the exhortation is to shine, to not let conformity dim your light: "Shine on, you crazy diamond."

	<TEXT> I'll try to give you the conservative view point since lots and lots of other redditors will give you their view in a flash. It really should be a non-partisan issue but I assume it comes with one party taking credit for the deal rather than the other. Anyway, from my view, this deal does nothing to perturb Iran from gaining a nuclear weapon. They closed down thousands of centrifuges, but they still have 5000 running. It took Pakistan 3000 to develop a bomb. Iran has also funded terrorism in the region. Just early in the week they were burning American flags and saying death to America. The equivalent of lifting their trade restrictions is like a country giving the US $8 Trillion. They also have four american hostages, 1 of whine we know has been tortured. He was running an underground Christian church.


They are radicals and I don't think I see many benefits from this deal.

EDIT: Their places can only be inspected if given 14 days notice. It can also only be inspected by Iran's allies or something similar (I'm blanking, sorry). So US inspectors aren't allowed in. </TEXT>
