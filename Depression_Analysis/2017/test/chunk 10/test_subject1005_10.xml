	<TEXT> I am so sorry to take up your valuable time on Reddit. But here are the facts of the situation. Bryan Cranston, hot off his Breaking Bad fame, get casted in a new blockbuster where he, and HE ALONE, dominated the trailer. You can defend as much as you want, but it doesn't change the fact it was marketed as though Cranston would be a bigger part of the movie. And why wouldn't they? People like me who have no interest in Godzilla, but have an interest in Break Bad's star would go see the movie. You have not made one concrete point to the contrary. I'm sorry you're annoyed, but your position is tough to defend when there are 30 different trailers you could pull up to prove my point.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> False advertising. At least that's my complaint. If he wasn't such a huge part of the trailer, it wouldn't bug me in the slightest. But it was advertised like he was the star and it is very clear why they did that. For example, it didn't bug me in the slightest that Ben Affleck was killed off immediately in Smokin Aces. Everyone knew he was in it, but it wasn't marketed like he was the star. Huge difference.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm a little confused about something. When the local police are investigating Tom on his identity to see if there is any weight to the mob's claim that he is someone else, why are they simply just asking him? Couldn't they actually do some investigation (SSN, birth cert, etc...) to verify his identity? He's a pretty popular member of his community.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> To be fair, and I'm not suggesting you are doing this, there are A LOT of people who start claiming collusion in some of the sit n go tourneys when they start losing. In a particular hand (you'll have to forgive me as I don't recall specifics), I was dealt small pocket pair like 2s and raised from late position. Big blind called me and it was heads up. Flop was a bunch of faces and he and I checked it down. Turned out he had a smaller pocket pair. But another player,small stacked and not in the hand, started accusing he and I of colluding. I think it may be a way of some players acting out their tilt. In your case, it does sound different however.  </TEXT>
