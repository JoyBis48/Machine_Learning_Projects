	<TEXT> I agree. We tried our best to have a no kids rule at our wedding but in practicality it didnt work. We had guests flying from interstate and it's hard for them to find a sitter locally. So I hired a few babysitters who entertained them in the bridal room away from the guests. My guests were happy and my husband and I were happy. A small price to pay for my sanity. Ideally I would have preferred no kids though.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Isn't the definition of a boom is that it is a few years of high prices followed by an over supply and saturation of the market and then a natural reduction of the number of suppliers following on from that. i.e. a bust. [Link](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/boom-and-bust-cycle.asp)

The difference is that the mining boom Australia experienced went on for much longer than many other booms, and that Australian politicians didn't capitalize on it by taxing the mining giants enough. 

Which brings me to: Should we really be having a budget deficit now and having to make cut backs? We just had one of the longest booms in history... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For crimes less than two years there is an alternate intensive correction order which means you serve your time outside the prison under strict rules. For many people this is a better approach. I guess it depends how severe your crime was and whether it's your first offence. It's not always clear cut.

I think one of the problems with prison is they don't really focus on rehabilitation just punishment. There is no psychological support apart from assessment and drug prescriptions in prison for example. I think this among other things contributes to statistics like this.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Actually I wanted to tell you that I have tried to save a large bird and I think it survived. It was a big Ibis and they're not the prettiest birds but it was on the road with what looked like a broken wing. All the cars were just driving around it and nobody cared. I was sure if I didn't get it someone would run over and kill it. I put on the hazard lights, got a fabric shopping bag I had in the car and took it to the wildlife vets. I think it survived.

I guess it just comes down to making a call. I wouldn't not try to help an animal if I thought I could but if you don't know what you're doing depending on the animal I guess it's also possible to harm them. Sometimes it might be better to call someone who knows what they're doing. We have WIRES in Australia. There might be something similar in other places.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well the thing is I don't know. I know some animals will reject their young if you touch them. I have also heard it's also generally bad to touch fish because you have oil on their scales and you can damage them. I also once handled a little Australian ring tailed possum after I tried to save it from a cat and I covered it with a towel and put it in a box. It physically was fine, with no cuts or anything but then it bit me and a couple of seconds later it died. I was told later that they have weak hearts and sometimes they can die like that. 

Anyway I'm no veterinarian so I can't give a good answer but I think some animals have a higher tolerance for human interaction than others.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That is the hardest part - getting your deposit/stamp duty together. 

There will be younger people who will get payrises faster than inflation, some will even get rises faster than house price rises, but saving for the deposit is the killer.

I worked out for every $10,000 that house prices go up I'd need to save approximately $2,500 toward my 20% deposit and stamp duty costs. If they're going up that much each week then it's just not possible for younger people, even if they are amongst the highest earners.  </TEXT>

Is it just me or does the infrastructure look pretty similar to how it is today? Has Sydney been progressing more slowly or is it just less visible?

I mean I know there are probably a lot of new things like the harbour tunnel, a lot of the motorways, a couple of bridges outside the CBD, but the city itself to me looks very familiar. I definitely noticed the shops, cars and trains have changed, and the people look less 80's, but not a lot else. Maybe I am missing something! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> First whoever you owe money to, give them a call and ask for an extension. A lot of places will do this for you if you ring in advance of the due date and ask. 

Rather than looking at payday loans, why don't you look at Personal Loans from Banks? 

Some examples:

* https://www.commbank.com.au/personal/personal-loans.html

* http://www.nab.com.au/personal/campaigns/loans/personal-loans/fy15q2car/index?own_cid=15009-2

* http://www.finder.com.au/personal-loans

Their interest rates should be better.

Also as others have mentioned payday loan companies are the worst. I would avoid them like the plague.

Another option might be a credit card with an interest free period. If you already have a credit card you can do balance transfers that attract 0% interest too. e.g. https://www.hsbc.com.au/1/2/personal/credit-cards/hsbc-credit-card


I don't want to be responsible for fuelling your poor money management, so get that shit under control and don't rely on these types of loans ever again after this ok !!!  </TEXT>

And I have a few concerns with this aside from the obvious lack of partitions.

* No room for larger bums
* Reflective panelling in front of the toilet
* Walking past people doing their business to the sink
* Only two toilet rolls... and not in easy to reach spots
* Lack of female sanitary bins - sorry but a regular bin doesn't cut it. :/ 
* The toilet roll closest in the picture is positioned right above the flushing button - bad design! 
* Lack of smell barriers or scents

Apparently the whole place is new but designed in 007 "Goldfinger" style decor.  </TEXT>

Also I forgot to mention that there are some institutions that don't use Mortgage Brokers. For example HSBC, which actually offered a pretty competitive rate. I also checked out CUA (Credit Union Australia) which had a competitive rate (I think mortgage brokers do use these guys but thought I would mention it anyway). Though there are discounts to take into account with the major banks, so you can't always just work off the advertised rate and you need to find out about each one. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Reading what you've been through, the things you've overcome are amazing. I would say that shows your resilience and is something that I would admire in a job candidate, rather than be concerned. Though I know not everyone will see it my way.

Like others have said, you don't need to tell people about what happened prior to your degree. They're not allowed to ask you your age in job interviews (due to discrimination reasons), so for all they know, you went through from school to uni. I don't list my high school on my resume. There is no need for that. You went to uni so you obviously finished school. If anyone does ask later just tell them you took a break, or you travelled, or looked after a sick relative, or anything you like really. Nobody needs to know if you don't want them to.  

I remember one guy in highschool coming to our school and telling everyone that people will ask you for your ATAR (or UAI as I knew it), for the rest of your life. That's bullshit. If you have a higher education, nobody cares about your school/ATAR ever again. It's getting now to the point employers don't even care about my university education, just my experience.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've been there and done that. It is nerve racking. Don't let anyone make you feel like it's too little. Stick to your guns. If there is anything the mortgage crises have shown us is that banks lend more than they should and significantly underestimate most people's living expenses. Do your sums and stick to your guns.

If you need to try out other mortgage brokers go for it. You can also apply directly with banks. One of the ways I've found mortgage brokers more helpful thank banks is because they educate you, and they also should provide you with advice to narrow down your choices (because there are a lot). That being said, never take someone's advice at face value - I always go and evaluate the options myself. Another thing is that Mortgage Brokers get different commissions (% of loan value) from different lenders, so you should ask them outright what they get, so you can understand if they have any motivation for recommending one over the other. 

If you want to try a different broker, I have a pretty good one I would recommend if you want. I tried going through Mortgage Choice too but I didn't feel comfortable with them. Banks were good but only if you know exactly what you're after.

Check out Cannex: http://www.canstar.com.au/home-loans/ They have some tools there that are helpful for evaluating loans. Also check out mozo: e.g. CBA: http://mozo.com.au/rate-and-review/commonwealth-bank/home-loan-reviews for more reviews.

One of the things that you might not realise is that Banks offer a discount if you have the 20% deposit and if you have a higher loan amount and for different brackets they offer different discounts (i.e. the larger the loan the bigger the interest rate discount). If you don't have a high loan amount, then you might consider shopping around for other deals, for example through Credit Unions/Building Societies. A good mortgage broker should be able to help you with this though, so don't worry too much. </TEXT>

My worst going home wet experience was when I was in Canada and it snowed for a bit, but then poured down raining while I was up at the top of the mountain. I thought my jacket was waterproof but turns out it is a bit old and lost it's waterproofness. I ended up buying a new t-shirt and wearing a garbage bag before putting all my freezing wet clothing back on over the top and riding the gondola down for about 30 mins before I could reach the hotel and have a warm shower. My whole body was bright red from being so cold and wet. It was brutal.

	<TEXT> They don't really know what the problem is but if you think about it logically there are some things which might not be helping.

Avoid products that are harmful to bees. Ever use ant-rid? Don't do that - it says it hurts bees on the packaging. You can put a bit of honey in a container and the ants will get stuck in it. Ever spray insecticide? Use natural products instead. There are lots of them, for example tomato leaves! 

Consider buying organic veggies. This means that farmers don't use pesticides heavily. Even your clothes can be produced with pesticides (e.g. cotton), so consider wearing clothes from more sustainable sources. 

It all sounds a bit much, so you might not be able to do all that, but consider just doing what you can. But if it means that in future we will still have fruits and vegetables because bees are still around to pollenate them, then I think it's worth it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think some people hold up future boyfriends/girlfriends to incredibly high standards.

You can't expect your partner to be 'perfect'. Nobody is. You're not perfect. Sometimes you're annoying too. The only thing is that you should be able to live with their flaws, just as they need have to accept they will live with yours. Don't envisage a happy ever after. It doesn't work that way. Relationships involve effort, compassion, understanding and kindness.

And if you're a stay at home parent, have a life of your own, don't just revolve your life around your partner and kids. Consider getting a part-time job, or furthering your education. You never know what life will throw at you and you should be able to support yourself if your partner dies, gets ill, etc. Don't take your ability to stay home for granted... a lot of people get screwed over later in life by not preparing for all possible futures. </TEXT>

I think it's because my car is getting old.  Just set aside $500 a year for emergency repairs like this stuff.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Life really throws some curveballs. I haven't been in your situation and I wouldn't pretend to know what it feels like. I'm really sorry for what you're going through... it sounds tough.

I have had some pretty terrible times. To be honest I didn't cope well at all. Sometimes I wonder how I ever made it out the other side. I guess it comes down to this... that each state is temporary. If I can just make it through A, then I'll think about B, and if I can get through B then I'll think about C. If I can focus on only worrying about one thing at a time, then I can make my problems more manageable. I am a bit of a problem solver, so I have plans, back-up plans and backups for the backup plans. I don't easily give up... but it really can sting when you have tried a lot of different options and are reaching the end of your tether. Sometimes then you need support, or to think about things a little differently. Hopefully you will get through it - sometimes it takes a long time, a lot longer than you might think - but eventually that state will be over and a new one will arrive.

Very few things in life turn out exactly the way you plan, so if life doesn't go to plan then I try to remind myself of that fact. I definitely didn't plan the life I have right now, but it's not better or worse than my plan... just different. 

If you ever need someone to talk to give us a buzz. I hope you can find the strength inside yourself to keep fighting. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Nobody has said that exact thing to me, but they've said other things which annoyed me.

Someone told me when I was about 14 before I was even fully aware of my depression myself that I should go on medication. I don't know why but this really irritated me... the fact that I remember this incident nearly 20 years later shows how much.

I just felt like how could they possibly know what I'm going through? I hadn't even talked to anyone about it. I barely knew her. I was just acting a certain way I guess and she noticed. So it was like someone had found my secret. I never reached or asked for help. As a teenager, I was a silent sufferer and nobody could get through to me because I shut everyone out. 

At the end of the day I look back and realise that it was probably their way of trying to help, and while I disliked them for years after that, it was mostly unjustified. 

I don't find a lot to be comforting but I suppose these days a caring, non-judgemental, open minded listener would do it. I don't often need advice or comforting statements, just a friend. And if I want advice or comforting statements then I'll ask for them.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've learnt that the level of pain I can cope with is much greater than I ever imagined I would be able to cope with.

I've also learnt compassion. People make mistakes. I make mistakes. I don't condone people's mistakes but I can accept them as that... mistakes. And I don't judge a whole person based on one or two actions. I also believe people do have the ability to change, and everyone is different in how they cope. 

However I am also very skeptical of people in general because I have been lied to a lot and taken advantage of, so now I don't trust people easily... mainly to protect myself. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I used to work at a Federal Government agency and quite a few people moved from interstate (all over the country) to work in Sydney.

They all used a rental property service. This was paid for by the government agency. If you can get your work or your partner's work to pay for it that would be ideal, but if not I think the service is worth the money. 

I'm sure there are a few around but just do a Google search for it.

	<TEXT> I think Australia does a decent job in general (especially when you look at [Vancouver](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness_in_Vancouver) or [San Fran](http://www.sfchronicle.com/archive/item/A-decade-of-homelessness-Thousands-in-S-F-30431.php) - though in SF's case it's not really their fault but more that there is no National welfare program, and they attracted homeless people there because they were one of the only places in the US who tried to help!) but there is room to do more. It is easy to fall through the cracks, and once you've fallen in, it can be so very hard to crawl back out. Sometimes people get put in emergency housing and then have no long-term follow-on accommodation and only a small percentage find a job that would allow them to support themselves. 

My opinion is that in Sydney it comes down to a few things:

* [Abuse Victims](https://www.dss.gov.au/our-responsibilities/housing-support/publications-articles/homelessness-general/homelessness-a-new-approach) - people who leave abusive relationships and homes but have nowhere to go such as children. Apparently [one in 5 people](https://www.dss.gov.au/our-responsibilities/housing-support/publications-articles/homelessness-general/homelessness-a-new-approach) seek emergency accommodation as a result of abuse. A quote from the linked article: 

The largest single cause of homelessness however is domestic violence. More than one in five people seeking emergency accommodation are escaping domestic violence. Most victims bring children with them which means they share in the disruption and trauma of being displaced from their home.

* The need for a reasonably well paying job (because Sydney is an expensive place to live, and a lot of homeless people have lower levels of education)
* Access to [affordable housing](http://www.ahuri.edu.au/themes/homelessness1) to enable you to work and have a life
* [Lack of a personal social support network (family and friends)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2729873/)
* [Mental Health Issues](https://mhaustralia.org/.../MHCA_Home_Truths_Layout_FINAL.pdf)
* [Physical Health Issues](http://www.nwhn.net.au/Issues/Health-Homelessness.aspx)
* [Addiction](http://www.uq.edu.au/.../docs/Johnson_Chamberlain_2ndAHRC2007.pdf)
* [Criminal History](http://posa.org.au/wp-content/uploads/.../CriminalRecordDiscrimination.pdf) - causing issues for finding employment
* [Discrimination](https://bullying.humanrights.gov.au/violence-harassment-and-bullying-and-homelessness) - e.g. Aborigines are disproportionately represented in the homeless community. 
* [Mental or Physical Disabilities](https://homelessnessclearinghouse.govspace.gov.au/about-homelessness/commonwealth-initiatives/national-homelessness-research/research-release-addressing-homelessness-amongst-persons-with-a-disability-identifying-and-enacting-best-practice-2012-aust/)

Of course there are more reasons, but these I think are some of the main ones.

I also think some people who are vulnerable of becoming homeless aren't aware of the [services](http://www.humanservices.gov.au/customer/subjects/accommodation-renting-and-homelessness) available to them by the government, and also by the [council](http://www.cityofsydney.nsw.gov.au/community/community-support/homelessness), especially as a lot of them have [lower education levels](http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Lookup/4102.0Main+Features20March+Quarter+2012). Also, when you've reached a low sometimes you're not thinking straight enough to be able to ask for help, and sometimes the help you need isn't available.

There is also [discrimination that occurs based on social status](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/DeakinLawRw/2002/15.html), e.g. once you're homeless or on welfare, making it very difficult to find a job, housing or support. 

If you want to do something about it then you could consider volunteering, every bit helps. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I love Peace Lily's. I got mine at Kmart. Just keep them out of direct sunlight because their leaves burn. I think I've seen Mother-in-law's tongue at Kmart too.

I personally don't like English Ivy and quite a few people don't, so [it's hard to find places that sell it](http://www.ourhouseplants.com/plants/ivy). There are [other suggestions here](http://www.growmeinstead.com.au/plant/english-ivy-sa.aspx), though Jasmine is much the same except with a strong scent. I mainly don't like it because it climbs up between gaps in the brickwork and the windows and when the stem thickens it can do a lot of damage. If it's in a pot away from too much sunlight or water though it's fine. I couldn't tell you where you can get it - we had one that took over half the yard of one of my parent's rental properties and it pulled down the gutter, so we had to kill it. 

You should be able to get Red-edged dracaena and Chrysanthemum's at Flower Power in Taren Point. Chrysanthemum's are really pretty but they have a really strong scent and produce a lot of pollen which means a lot of people have [allergies](http://www.dermnetnz.org/dermatitis/plants/chrys.html) to them (respiratory and skin). I'm not sure if I would have them indoors but if it's just you and you don't have allergies to it, then it might be fine.  </TEXT>

Last year, I was working with a company in the US and still couldn't work at home because my internet is too crap, so I head into the city office where they have a better connection. :/ 

As someone in a tech role I should be able to work from home around 70% of the time, but until home internet speeds are better I will be forced into the office.  </TEXT>
