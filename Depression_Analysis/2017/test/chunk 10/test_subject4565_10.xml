	<TEXT> Does this remind anybody else of Michael Hasting's death? Almost 2 years, RIP.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Hastings_%28journalist%29

Death

"On June 18, 2013, Hastings died in a single-vehicle automobile crash in his Mercedes C250 Coup at approximately 4:25 a.m. in the Hancock Park neighborhood of Los Angeles.[53] A witness to the crash said the car seemed to be traveling at maximum speed and was creating sparks and flames before it fishtailed and crashed into a palm tree.[54][55] Video from a nearby security camera purportedly shows Hastings' vehicle speeding and bursting into flames after crashing.[56]

Witnesses described the car's engine being ejected 50 to 60 yards (4655 m) from the scene.[55][57] Hastings' body was burned beyond recognition. The coroner identified the body by matching fingerprints with those the FBI had on file.[58][59] Two days after the crash, the Los Angeles Police Department declared that there were no signs of foul play.[60] The coroner's report ruled the death to be an accident.[61] An autopsy showed that the cause of death was massive blunt force trauma consistent with a high-speed crash.[61]

Hastings was eulogized in the media by figures such as Christopher Hayes,[62] Rachel Maddow,[63] his co-workers at BuzzFeed,[64] and others.[65]

Allegations of foul play, and assertions to the contrary

Soon after his death, some described the circumstances surrounding the crash as suspicious.[66]

Former U.S. National Coordinator for Security, Infrastructure Protection, and Counter-terrorism Richard A. Clarke said that what is known about the crash is "consistent with a car cyber attack". He was quoted as saying "There is reason to believe that intelligence agencies for major powersincluding the United Statesknow how to remotely seize control of a car. So if there were a cyber attack on [Hastings'] carand I'm not saying there was, I think whoever did it would probably get away with it."[67] Earlier the previous day, Hastings indicated that he believed he was being investigated by the FBI. In an email to colleagues, which was copied to and released by Hastings' friend, Army Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs,[68] Hastings said that he was "onto a big story", that he needed to "go off the radar", and that the FBI might interview them.[69][70] WikiLeaks announced that Hastings had also contacted Jennifer Robinson, one of its lawyers, a few hours prior to the crash,[71] and the LA Weekly reported that he was preparing new reports on the CIA at the time of his death.[72] His widow Elise Jordan said his final story was a profile of CIA Director John O. Brennan.[73] The FBI released a statement denying that Hastings was being investigated.[60]

Motor Trend technical director Frank Markus said that the ensuing fire was consistent with a high-speed car crash.[74]

There are conflicting opinions as to Hastings' death. After his death, some media outlets recalled that Hastings claimed to have received death-threats from the military after the McChrystal article.[75] Hastings' widow Elise Jordan has said she believes his death to be "just a really tragic accident".[76][77] His older brother, Jonathan, said he believed Michael was experiencing a "manic episode" shortly before his death, and that he may have had suspicions were it not for this observation.[78]

Cenk Uygur, friend of Hastings' and host of The Young Turks, told KTLA that many of Michael's friends were concerned that he was "in a very agitated state", saying he was "incredibly tense" and worried that his material was being surveilled by the government. Friends believed that Michael's line of work led to a "paranoid state".[79] USA Today reported that in the days before his death, Hastings believed his car was being "tampered with" and that he was scared and wanted to leave town.[80]
FBI files
FBI file on Michael Hastings

The FBI file on Michael Hastings and its attachments (totaling 21 pages) were released to the public on September 24, 2013,[81][82][83] after investigative journalist Jason Leopold and MIT doctoral candidate Ryan Shapiro filed a joint suit in July 2013 against the FBI for ignoring their FOIA requests for the file.[84]

The FBI failed to respond to the requests within the allotted 20-day period.[85] On August 15, Leopold released a statement that read, "The Department of Justice (DOJ) has indicated that the FBI has likely located responsive records pertaining to investigative journalist Michael Hastings".[86] Al Jazeera, along with Shapiro, released results from a FOIA request showing that the FBI's Washington field office had opened a file on Hastings in June 2012 to store "unclassified media articles" and "memorialize controversial reporting by Rolling Stone magazine on June 7, 2012". The attorney who filed the FOIA lawsuit, Jeff Light, suggested that it was uncommon for the FBI to open such files on reporters."

	<TEXT> According to your post history, you're an animal science major thinking about becoming a vet? And your posting a picture clearly demonstrating animal cruelty/abuse? 

"Your friend" is a piece of shit.

If it's not your cat, perhaps you should rescue it from whoever took this photo. Do you actually care about animals? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So... OP was in the bathroom while the cat, sitting on top of the toilet, "got into the shaving cream" as the title suggests, knocking it onto the floor and immediately divebombing on top of it as it explodes. Then, the cat decided to roll and thrash around in the same spot, ending up staring into a corner, and waited while OP got his/her phone out and took a picture.

That's probably what happened, right?

I can see why your cats look at you this way. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's tough because there's not a lot of Bitcoin owners out there, in proportion to non-bitcoin owners. And many of those who do hold, are doing so long term, not readily spending. Also, because of the inconvenience and security risk associated with 3rd parties, many people will shy away from a Bitcoin transfer when there are other viable alternatives (cash, money order, check, credit, Paypal, etc.)

There needs to be some serious changes (at a society and infrastructure level) before you can expect frequent Bitcoin payments while working in an industry not at all related to Bitcoin. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Look at the cats body language. It is clearly scared of the person holding the camera. Whoever took this photo, intentionally sprayed this cat with shaving cream, like an inhumane piece of shit. 

The cats nose is scratched up and there's shaving cream in it's fucking eye.

It is also sprayed fresh underneath the toilet on the wall showing it was being sprayed from well above ground level. </TEXT>
