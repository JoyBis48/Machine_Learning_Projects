	<TEXT> From your [Wikipedia link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordie_Howe_International_Bridge#Opposition), evidently the freaking Koch Brothers are involved too. 

 In early June 2011, the conservative group Americans for Prosperity posted bogus eviction notices on homes in Detroits Delray district. With the words "Eviction Notice" in large type, the notices told homeowners their properties could be taken by the Michigan Department of Transportation to make way for the proposed new bridge. The groups state director said the fake notices were intended to get residents to contact state lawmakers, to ask them to vote against the bridge project.[38]

	<TEXT> You're projecting your thoughts into my head. My ideal solution is one single state where Jews, Christians and Muslims are living wherever they want and worshipping freely. If you call the death of a Jewish-only state as genocide, then you are deluded. 

The terrorists, the ISIS types, the ones who actually wish a military destruction of Israel would fight against "pro-Palestinians" if Israel is out of the way. They give Israel's military a justification, and most of us don't like that. It's why we have our own organizations and don't work with them. 

I want what happened to South Africa to happen to Israel. Last I heard, when the apartheid there ended, there wasn't some genocide of white South Africans. Now, prejudices there still remain, but people there aren't subject to discrimination and massive human rights violations.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You're putting stereotypes into my comment when there is nothing there. You might be right about sematrix, but you might be surprised how many people support the Palestinian cause because they are against the injustices committed against them, not because of some reprehensible prejudice against Jews. I'm no supporter of people like sematrix, as you'll see elsewhere in this thread. 

Groups like the Neuteri Karta, blogs like Mondoweiss (run by Jewish bloggers), individuals like Anna Baltzer and Max Blumenthal, and organizations like B'Tselem and Jewish Voice for Peace make it abundantly clear that the problem is not with Judaism nor the Jewish people. </TEXT>
