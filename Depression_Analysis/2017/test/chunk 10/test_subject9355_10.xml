	<TEXT> I guess it was when I was 19, I dropped out of school and decided the thing for me to do was to move, far away, Australia. I was going through a lot of emotional issues at the time and I hoped that moving to another place would help me 'discover' myself in some way. I flew out there on a shoestring budget so I had loads of connections, it was a long trip! I eventually made it to my hostel in Sydney, I remember being completely shellshocked as I lay on my bed, I wasn't the best at speaking to people back then so it took me days before I met anyone, that's the loneliest moment if my life so far. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I went to college with this guy who was really into ghost hunting, like it was all he would talk about. Anyway one day after class he invites myself and another classmate to a ghost exploration, thing. So we figured why not might be a laugh. We met up outside this old building in the middle of town, there were a few others there also. The building was the oldest prison in the city, where they used to keep murders ect. 

When we went in, the first thing that happened was the lights were turned off so it was pitch black in there. We then stood in a circle and held hands as he started calling out to the spirits, I'm not sure what was supposed to happen but I found it hilarious how you could still hear the cars ect on the street. Anyway after a bit of that he started throwing marbles into rooms, the idea was that when a marble came back that was it being 'interfered' with in some way - I seen right through this as he was basically chucking them and they would hit the wall at the other side and come back. 

I ended up volunteering to sit in a prison cell on my own upstairs while the others continued to do more hand-circle callouts. Every time someone would ask the spirit to "make itself known" I would make a little noise like "crawww" and they would all shit themselves. Anyway, that was an odd experience but interesting. </TEXT>
