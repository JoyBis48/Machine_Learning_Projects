	<TEXT> If someone wants a gun and is willing to obtain it illegally, they will obtain one. Just look at Chicago, 16 year olds have all the guns they need. Laws only restrict the law abiding. 

You also must remember the 2nd amendment to the US constitution. The restrictions you mention are not enumerated by the Constitution. A few restrictions have been allowed but they are almost entirely as a result of John Dillinger and other prohibition era gangsters and the 1968 gun act. Further restrictions will be resisted by those, including myself, who view them as a violation of constitutional law. If you want to have guns restricted then you must change the constitution first. The constitution specifically ensured the people would be armed to act as a check and balance against government oppression and allow the people to revolt if necessary.  As a result, most gun owners  are against giving up their guns or restricting their ownership based on our natural rights

	<TEXT> The Left has a long history of never being satisfied with half measure when it comes to ideological issues. As a result, any limited measures of gun control are only stepping stones in an incremental quest for a  total ban over private gun ownership. 

I simply don't believe that the Left will quit after a few gun control measures are passed. Wide-scale gun registration or gun permitting schemes would be used to identify gun owners to be used to aid future gun confiscation by government.

	<TEXT> We both agree that the Democrat Party renounced overt racism after a century of vile racist policies. 

There is no proof that the GOP as a result decided to embrace racism.

The Southern Strategy is based on a single interview by Lee Atwater in which he stated that the GOP was focusing on economic issues to attract disenchanted Southern Democrat voters who felt the Democrat Party had moved too far to the Left. Atwater stated that it was economics issues and not appeals to "nigger nigger" that would attract those Dixiecrat voters.

The movement of Southern Democrat voters to the GOP was not a sudden event as the result of the 1964 Civil Rights act. The migration was a slow transition that last over 40 years.

No party would embrace racism. Why do you think the Democrats renounced it in 1964? Because racists are a small voting block compared to all voters. It would be tantamount to a political party embracing molesters as a voting block. The upside would be minute and the downside to a party would be enormous.

	<TEXT> You need to go back to school my friend. Naziism, as well as Fascism, were socialist movements. Hitler opposed Communists because he considered them as too internationally focused and too Jewish. He also viewed them as competition. The Nazis were the National Socialist Workers Party. Hitler was a prolific socialist writer and philosopher.  

He came up with the idea for national socialism by combining the key elements of socialism such as government (or community) control over the means of production and a government centric society at the expense of personal liberty with  elements of nationalism. 

Control over the means of production and distribution does not necessarily mean government owns an industry. It can also mean the government (or community) controls privately held industry.

I am telling you with all sincerity that Reagan would be embraced by the Tea Party today. The Left lies by claiming that the Tea Party is extreme but in reality, the Tea Party is simply garden variety, historical Conservatism.  The Left also lies by claiming the Tea Party is racist but they NEVER provide any proof of that lie.  </TEXT>

I bet if you were educated or at least politically astute you would have added something meaningful to the discussion. Sadly you were unable. Ha ha but at least you were funny.... not.... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You are delusional. Someone is raping these women. Again, if it is not Mexicans then who is doing the raping?

I am sorry that the facts here do not follow your narrative of how reality is supposed to be. Sometimes people like Trump speak the truth and he is not motivated by racism. Regardless, those on the Left can never even consider such realities. There is only the narrative that white males are racists who are motivated by nothing else. 

What a sad little rigid, closed worldview you have.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Who is doing the raping of 80% of the women and girls trekking to the US from Mexico and Central America? Is it white American police? Is it college frat boys? 

Mexicans, whether they be illegal aliens, coyotes, police officials are the ones doing the raping. 

But by and large, when they arrive in the US, they do not become criminals.

By entering the country illegally they are criminals as soon as they cross over the border. Granted most are not going on and committing further crimes but a disturbing percentage are and most are going on public assistance as soon as they arrive here which is a violation of welfare statutes.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 12 million. That policy was supposed to solve the illegal immigration crisis. All it accomplished was to make 12 million illegal aliens citizens and opened the door for tens of millions more that we are discussing today. If we do not close the borders then once the illegals here now are legitimized then a new crop of millions more will come across the border. The cycle will never end </TEXT>

	<TEXT> ALL of the other candidates are milquetoast politicians who say nothing but lame platitudes and vague policies. Bernie Sanders is different in that he offers specific (yet tired and historically failed) socialist policies. Scott Walker and Ted Cruz are offering interesting solutions but too many Conservatives have promised to give DC an enema but end up becoming seduced by power and cash. 

Who do you believe is stating anything substantive that has not been processed through the politically correct, focus group, mush machine? </TEXT>

Who lives in Mexico? Mexicans

Trump said that the illegal aliens who are streaming across the border are not Mexico and Central America's best and brightest. Many are drug dealers, gang members, rapists, and welfare recipients. Can you refute those claims? He did not say that every Mexican was a rapist. </TEXT>
