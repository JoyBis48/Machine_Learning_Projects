Dylann Roof may very well have been mentally disturbed but the media have chosen to ignore that angle and have completely chosen to ignore how his attack was a planned murder-suicide and not just a murderous massacre. He ran out of bullets and didn't manage to kill himself after he killed his victims. The media wants him to look as bad as possible so they'll call him a terrorist like they want to and ignore any other possible motive for his killing such as mental health related to suicide and depression.

	<TEXT> Can someone tell me why she gets as much attention and publicity as she does? I'm not an MMA fan at all but I just saw her do this on TV and I've seen her on TV a lot over the last year and I'm not sure why she is so well-known. I know very little about MMA other than it apparently has become a fairly popular sport in the last couple of years. However, I don't think that women's MMA is popular at all yet I would wager that more Americans know who Rhonda Rousey is than they do other well-known male MMA fighters. Can someone in this sub explain her apparent popularity to me or why the mainstream media and sports media seem to pay attention to her so much? Serious question and not rhetorical or trolling in any way. 

Edit: You people are pretty weird. I explicitly state I'm not trolling and just asking an honest question to try and understand something and you downvote me. OK.. </TEXT>

No, it won't. They'll ban CoonTown, maybe WhiteRights, probably not TheRedPill, and maybe some other shock value and seedy subs like rapingwomen and CandidFashionPolice. Reddit will kick up a bit of a storm but not much at all, far less of a tantrum than the one that we saw during the banning of FatPeopleHate. Life will then proceed as normal a week after the purge and redditors will continue to visit the site because they really don't care about those subs being banned. FPH was a sub that had the power of reaching /r/all every day and it was honestly a force to be reckoned with because it had so much activity and so many subscribers. None of the subs that Huffman is going to ban really have much of a base that had the power of FPH in voting and gaining visibility.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  So some people on the jury did feel that her case had some validity.

It was literally 1 woman whose objectivity as a juror was questionable. She was very emotional when all of the other jurors disagreed with her view that Ellen was the victim of discrimination. 

 Without knowing anything, "you" assume she was unjustly let go.

I never once mentioned the firing/resignation of Victoria. 

 if a ceo posted a blog with racial slurs, the same type of people why wanted Pao gone for things she said, would defend the racist Ceo.

You don't really have much evidence or proof of this anywhere, especially here on reddit, and I would wager that if this CEO was in charge of a corporation or entity in which their racial views could affect their decision-making or running of their entity then the patrons or employees of said entity could rightly take issue with them.

	<TEXT> The "but reddit's a private website and you have no guarantee of free speech" argument trotted out by people like you has never been a great argument since the argument doesn't extend beyond the notion of the admins saying "because I said so" when asked why they don't allow certain subreddits. At least try not to be lazy and employ some of the historical arguments made in the past for freedom of speech and what not. Better to say and elaborate deeply on why free speech shouldn't be allowed on a privately owned website instead of just saying "Cuz it's my website brah and I do what I want!" to anyone who questions the limiting of free speech on reddit. 

 hate speech

Hate speech is in the eye of the beholder and in this case it could have been in Ellen Pao's eyes or in the eyes of Huffman and Alexis. Know what? After how I've seen these people behave over the years and over the past year, I really don't want them making moral judgments on what should and shouldn't be allowed here and on what constitutes hate speech. For some people, /r/MensRights is a hate group akin to a neo-Nazi group or forum while other people think that it's just a group dedicated to addressing the issues of men in an ever-changing society in which they are feeling threatened, troubled, and or confused about their roles as males among other things. 

This is why you don't let people regulate hate speech because then you get differing views on what exactly it is and the Potter Stewart position of "I know it when I see it" doesn't always fly with people like myself who don't want a sole individual's pair of eyes making judgments for the rest of us.  </TEXT>
