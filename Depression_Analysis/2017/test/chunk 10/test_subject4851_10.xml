What is the plan? What about congress? 

I have nothing against Sanders (i'm actually pretty much sold on him except I will do my homework/research before a final decision), but I am not going to invest my psychic strength in the presidential election just to watch congress get Jerrymandered to death.

	<TEXT> This is very true. It brings go mind, the advice Christ gave to the one rich fellow: part with your riches. Most people think this was meant for everyone. But it is only meant for a very specific type of person who, as you alluded to, the wealth would effectively paralyze rather than help.

Some people will use the wealth in a productive, furthering way. For others, it will rob them of the fire to be successful and do something with their lives. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think this advice, while well intended, is the wrong one. Money is as water, it is designed to move and not stay put. It is just in trying to 'put away' money (ie. holding water in your hands) that it will slowly trickle away and eventually flow elsewhere completely.
Dream a dream and go after it. There is nothing more potent than having a goal of what to do with the money. The absence of this is the presence of exactly what the author enumerated.

	<TEXT> TL;DR: What we have is a modern-day case of the emperors new clothes. So many compromises to the truth have been made and careers advanced by hiding or glossing over gender-integration issues in the military. It will take concerted opposition from a range of politicians who have the courage to look beyond the latest headline in the New York Times or on CNN.

	<TEXT> Isn't this a little too convenient? Doesn't it give freedom to so many things that are logically objectionable? 

One person may enjoy dog fights, another the torturing animals or other human beings. Yet others rape, murder, etc.

No, enjoyment shouldn't even be a factor.
