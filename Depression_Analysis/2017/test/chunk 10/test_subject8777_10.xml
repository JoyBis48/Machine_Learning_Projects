	<TEXT> Song is dope man, the layering is pretty spot on. the vocal is in the mix pretty well too, maybe bus everything but the vocals to a compressor to give your voice and the mix a little separation but your delivery is on point man! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> the beat is pretty cool, but sparse and lacking some low end.. just an old timey sample with drums behind it...maybe throw in a bassline or some subsonic shit to give it some bottom. The song itself is pretty good tho, and your voice sounds good too. the delivery is pretty decent however you might want to try doing a beat that is a little faster instead of trying to drag out some of your phrasing, I think your voice would be better suited for something a little quicker. Maybe try to compress the vocals a little to settle them into the mix or even just bring the volume down a little. other than that the lyrics were good and definitely something to keep doing! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> thanks for that man! Yea I boosted a little around 150-250hz range to bring out a little more of that low end and I was just now playing my bass to the song but it was real quick and didnt think to try an octave lower.. I am going to give it a try and I agree on the hats as well, I think I just needed to hear someone say it to me! Thanks brotha! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree with jmilnazikmusic, flight to catch is a dope track. The intro is nice interesting making me want to hear more. But the drums do sound like they are limited. You can almost hear them hitting the ceiling. There is alot going on in the high end that makes some the hits a little hard to take when you are listening to it on headphones. That being said, maybe take the limiter off and try to compress the drums a little bit to set them apart from the track a little bit with a high pass filter side chained just to maybe eliminate some of those higher frequencies when the mix is getting louder. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> super fluid man, I like all the percussion clicks and pops going on all over the place! The vocal sample (not of the singing in the beginning) came in super hot and surprised me a little. maybe dial down a little bit so it settles in the mix a little more. Very interesting man and a nice listen for sure! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I like the raw sample feel to the song! Some of the scratches are a little off timing in the beginning but still nice sounding. I have to ask if it was you on the table? The swing to the song is nice as well and has a little bit of an interesting break in the middle and the kick was a little loud. All in all, I dug it!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Gotta make your way up to the Owens river gorge area and the whitmore hot tubs.. valley in between two mtn ranges and you feel soo small its incredible! However, weekends can have a few other campers there. Did a trip to owens river gorge a couple months ago to climb and camped at the whitmore hot springs on a Sunday, Monday, Tuesday and Sunday had a few people at the different hot springs but on Monday and Tuesday it was pretty sparse with people so it made for some nice alone time. From san Diego its a 5-6 hr drive up the 395 but totally worth it!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 420 has everything to do with weed. In the 70's there was a group of high school kids in San Rafael that got detention for a week straight. The detention let out at 420pm everyday and they would all get together then to smoke after their detentions. At that time, it was more about the time of day and not the date 4-20 but as time went on, both were adapted by the smoking culture. 

It has everything to do with weed, officially.  </TEXT>
