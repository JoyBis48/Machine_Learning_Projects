	<TEXT> The media made Anaconda seem like some transcendent shit too. [GQ wrote an entire profile on her and how Anaconda was this secretly subversive video](http://www.gq.com/story/nicki-minaj). Nicki didn't really do much to explain what it meant when it came out initially and now she's mad that everyone missed the message. 

We kind don't know what the fuck it's supposed to be about. Hyper-sexuality? Beats pill? Coconut innuendos? Big butts?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's a bit different. Taylor was parlaying her music and huge fanbase to get paid by steaming companies. Nicki, Jay, and Kanye were trying to own a streaming service and drag their fans with them. They didn't offer exclusivity, they didn't offer a better product, and they didn't really offer much to sell it wither other than pretending like they were the founding fathers in a misjudged launch.

Taylor knows the biggest asset she has is her back catalog and album which moves actual physical product like no other pop artist. She uses it as leverage against Apple. 

I'm not to convinced it's about race here. Nicki was trying to team up with people selling a product that everyone already has for free. Taylor uses a product everyone doesn't have because they expect it to be steamed most of the time. There's a scarcity of Talyor's music while there's a fuck ton of streaming services. </TEXT>

She keeps mentioning these surgeries. She probably had something to do with the sex ring once and those surgeries were a result of whatever happened in those rings. Now she's is toppling the Vinci power clan one by one.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They hilarious thing about Trump is he got a bunch of politicians to talk about whether or not POW's are losers. Lindsay Graham is going on TV talking about how he believes POW's aren't losers. This huckster show is riotous. Best one of the season.

AND THEN, he kind of got John McCain to apologize for calling the people at Trump's rally crazies. Trump has managed to take advantage of a dysfunctional political system and a bunch of hypocritical lightweights who don't know what to do when faced with someone so stupidly brutish. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The Red Pill is 120 thousand fit college educated middle class men. If we really wanted to we could invade New Zealand and install a new government. We definitely have the manpower. There are plenty of veterans here. Plus everyone here knows where the magazine release is on an M16, from years of playing Call Of Duty.

Realistically the Red Pill Reaction Force would be far more effective than half the world's militaries. The Afghan military is fucked up on opium. The Iraqi army cant even do jumping jacks. Plus New Zealand has only 8 thousand military personnel the majority of whom are useless paper pushers.

I don't actually support the violent overthrow of New Zealand. I just think its kind of a fun idea conceptualy.

	<TEXT> If we ban pics of girls we should just do a sitewide ban of guy pics as well. We can't have feminists fingerbanging to underage boys.

In fact, let's just ban ANY pic just to be on the safe side.

This is really just a censorship issue. There's porn of all kinds on every single site out there. There's BARELY LEGAL TEEN porn which is extremely popular. Hell, even Brooke Shields and Traci Lords put underage porn into MAINSTREAM MOVIES.

Sure we shouldn't be sexualizing naked children, but if you're going to start banning legal content just for the sake of hoping to catch illegal content, how is that any different than an officer firing into the crowd of a fleeing robber with a shotgun just to make sure he gets the bad guy?

Do just like any other site: do your DUE DILIGENCE to remove any illegal content just as any site would. But it's definitely not your responsibility to police ALL content. That's just impossible. Even 4chan is notorious for DAILY KIDDIE PORN PICS. but the mods remove them as soon as they can because they CAN'T be held accountable for other people's posts otherwise reddit would likewise be held liable for ANY instance of an illegal pic.

Even Iggy Azalea made a child porn video where she tried to seduce an underage little boy with her pussy. That was allowed on YOUTUBE. So let's not get ahead of ourselves here. It's really not about the images themselves as much as the gatekeepers in charge of SEXUALIZING THE CONTEXT according to their feminist agenda.

I've seen pics on reddit of parents and strangers posting pics of naked kids playing in a bathtub or near the shower. If ALL naked children are to be removed, those would fall under 'illegal'.

If something is sexualizing a child in an obvious manner, we can remove it, no problem. But if someone is using their feminist liberal agenda to say "THAT is sexual TO ME" then we should tell them to fuck off. I mean social justice warriors support and still buy Lena Dunham's book where she admits to MOLESTING HER LITTLE SISTER. Except it's not considered molestation because the Social Justice Warriors are in charge of setting the context. Instead of Lena Dunham the CHILD MOLESTER touching her sister's vagina, it's warped into a fun childhood game of innocent curiosity. Again, it all depends on the gatekeepers interpretation of events.

Our goal should be to stand against censorship, not give it an excuse to GROW. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Bud, no tienes ni idea de lo que ests hablando. Usted no ha ledo * Por qu Ascensor * y por lo tanto no tienen la primera puta idea de con qu criterios ticos / estticas Snyder era desdeoso de las convenciones tradicionales de entrenamiento. Usted no ha ledo * Paleo Me Plenty *. Usted no lo hace, por ejemplo, sabe otra gran rgimen de Snyder despedido, o por qu. Usted no est haciendo un esfuerzo para digerir verdad o participar en un dilogo permanente tanto como corroyendo l. Pero tal vez usted est sobre-rating Snyder como el ms grande director de levantamiento de todos los tiempos. Slo est arrancado, por lo tanto, la gente piensa que levanta. Aumento de volumen de Peter Jackson es lo mismo que la rutina perezosa 3x5 representante de Snyder.

Yo podra caer tanto la jerga de la aptitud avanzada en usted, sera hacer girar su cabeza, pero no lo har. En su lugar, voy a simplemente sealar que usted no sabe lo que cualquiera de los diferentes modos de ascensores muertos son, o cmo apoderarse de la regeneracin del tejido muscular. Nunca se ha ledo y no sabes que gente como Miln de Crotona, Galeno, o Frederic Delavier son- y esos son slo los biggies. Usted ha ledo / visto casi nada de entrenamiento con pesas clsico, si lo hay. Ciertamente no escolsticamente. Usted googled algo de mierda sobre un fsico de admiracin y copiar / pegar algo escrito en / r / fitness que usted no tiene ninguna base para la comprensin. T- s, el poco producto mudo, ciego, al abrigo de la industria de ejercicio que usted es, contribuir a nuestra degradacin del tejido muscular del mundo y. (Ni siquiera sabes lo que eso significa, porque no sabes lo que es una buena forma). Insultas lo que eres ignorante acerca. Y eso es una cosa de mierda que hacer. Le sugiero que tome un inventario personal honesto y, a continuacin, tratar de hacer algo mejor de ti mismo. Porque ahora mismo, eres jodidamente asqueroso de leer. Honestamente, creo que deberas estar avergonzado de ti mismo, y debe considerar pedir disculpas a este hilo. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Bud, you have no clue what you're talking about. You haven't read *Why Lift* and therefore haven't the first fucking clue with which ethical/aesthetic criteria Snyder was dismissive of traditional workout conventions. You haven't read *Paleo Me Plenty*. You don't, for example, know another great regimen Snyder dismissed, or why. You aren't making an effort to truly digest or engage in an ongoing dialogue so much as corroding it. But perhaps you're over-rating Snyder as the greatest lifting director of all time. He's just ripped, therefore people think he lifts. Peter Jackson's bulking is just the same as Snyder's lazy 3x5 rep routine.

I could drop so much advanced fitness jargon on you, it would make your head spin, but I won't. Instead, I'll simply point out that you don't know what any of the different modes of dead lifts are, or how they seize upon muscle tissue regeneration. You've never read and don't know who people like Milo of Croton, Galen, or Frederic Delavier are- and those are just the biggies. You've read/seen next to no classic weight training, if any. Certainly not scholastically. You googled some shit about admiring physiques and copy/pasted something written in /r/fitness that you have no basis for understanding. You- yes the dumb, blind, sheltered little product of the exercise industry that you are, contribute to our world's and muscle tissue degradation. (You don't even know what that means because you don't know what good form is). You insult what you're ignorant about. And that's a really shitty thing to do. I suggest you take an honest personal inventory, and then try to make something better of yourself. Because right now, you're pretty fucking disgusting to read. Honestly, I think you should be ashamed of yourself, and should consider apologizing to this thread.

This. Is. Not. Just. About. Video games.

These people want to destroy those of you who speak out and control the rest. You've seen them talk on twitter and tumblr, they will happily put you to death if they could and drink your tears while doing so. Video games is one front of a much larger war. It does not begin or end with video games and if you don't fight you are going to lose so much more than just a hobby. This is the end of the war, they have been winning it for years.

If you want to live in a world where some histrionic pampered brat and her sniveling cohorts can cry harassment and shut down entire websites then yeah sure do nothing just protect the vidya I guess. If that idea disgusts you then it is time to stand up if you haven't already and fight them on every level. Remember Shirtgate?

	<TEXT> Here's the thing. You said "Sanders is a socialist."

Is he in the same family? Yes. No one's arguing that.

As someone who is on the internet who reads /r/politics, I am telling you, specifically, in the Berniesphere, no one calls Sanders a socialist. If you want to be "specific" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing.

If you're saying "socialist family" you're referring to the political grouping of leaders who aren't scumbags, which includes things from Democratic Socialists to unions to Europeans.

So your reasoning for calling Sanders a socialist is because random people "call the raising the minimum wage socialism?" Let's get free broadband and healthcare in there, then, too.

Also, calling Donald Trump an average Republican or a racist? It's not one or the other, that's not how politics works. He's both. Bernie is a Social Democrat and a member of the socialist family. But that's not what you said. You said Sanders is a socialist, which is not true unless you're okay with calling everyone who isn't a a corporate puppet a socialist, which means you'd call Ron Paul, Alex Jones, and /r/politics socialists, too. Which you said you don't.

It's okay to just admit you're a corporate shill, you know?

	<TEXT> My wife and I attended Bernies rally in Dallas. That morning, she called her dad to ask if our youngest daughter, who stayed the night with him last night, could remain at his house until this evening. She mentioned that she and I were going to be out of town and, when he asked where we were going, she nonchalantly said that we were going to see Bernie Sanders speak. Her father, who is probably a 2%er, flipped a biscuit. He started screaming that he could not believe that his daughter would even entertain the idea of voting for a 'self-described socialist who wants to make the entire country a welfare state.' My wife, who is pretty easily flustered, allowed him to vent. She then stated that, 'he hasn't earned my vote yet, daddykins, I just want to hear what he has to say.' Her father then yelled, 'if you go that rally, you are out of the will!' (He's generally a calm person; I personally think he'd been drinking, but he is very much right wing). My wife then said something I will never forget: 'Bernie Sanders can't be bought. What makes you think I can, daddy-o? The threat of me losing my inheritance is not going to stop me from doing what is right. I am going and the fact that you are threatening me is undemocratic and not very dank.' He then promptly hung up on her. Then everyone applauded and gave her a $100% bill. My wife's name? Albert Einstein. I LOVE MY WIFE!!! Just wanted to share.

No empieza ni termina con videojuegos y si no luchas que se va a perder mucho ms que slo un hobby. Este es el final de la guerra, han estado ganando durante aos. Gamergate era una resistencia sorpresa que apareci despus de nuestras "fuerzas" haban sido derrotados y sacrificados en el altar de la justicia social desde hace dcadas. Si quieres vivir en un mundo donde algunos mocoso mimado histrinica y sus cohortes llorones pueden llorar hostigamiento y cerrar sitios web completos entonces s seguro no hacer nada simplemente proteger el vidya supongo. Si la idea te repugna, entonces es hora de ponerse de pie, si no lo ha hecho y luchar contra ellos en todos los niveles. Recuerde Shirtgate? Recuerde cmo hicieron un cientfico grito de mierda en lo que debera haber sido el mejor da de su vida? Ms de una camisa?

	<TEXT> Do you motherfuckers understand now? DO YOU? Let me spell it out one more time for the densest among you.

This. Is. Not. Just. About. Video games.

These people want to destroy those of you who speak out and control the rest. You've seen them talk on twitter and tumblr, they will happily put you to death if they could and drink your tears while doing so. Video games is one front of a much larger war. It does not begin or end with video games and if you don't fight you are going to lose so much more than just a hobby. This is the end of the war, they have been winning it for years. Gamergate was a surprise resistance that popped up after our "forces" had been routed and slaughtered on the altar of social justice for decades. If you want to live in a world where some histrionic pampered brat and her sniveling cohorts can cry harassment and shut down entire websites then yeah sure do nothing just protect the vidya I guess. If that idea disgusts you then it is time to stand up if you haven't already and fight them on every level. Remember Shirtgate? Remember how they made a motherfucking scientist cry on what should have been the best day of his life? Over a shirt? It's not just about video games these people are monsters in human skin. Fight them!

	<TEXT> A liberal muslim homosexual ACLU lawyer professor and abortion doctor was teaching a class on Karl Marx, known atheist
Before the class begins, you must get on your knees and worship Marx and accept that he was the most highly-evolved being the world has ever known, even greater than Jesus Christ!
At this moment, a brave, patriotic, pro-life Navy SEAL champion who had served 1500 tours of duty and understood the necessity of war and fully supported all military decision made by the United States stood up and held up a rock.
How old is this rock, pinhead?
The arrogant professor smirked quite Jewishly and smugly replied 4.6 billion years, you stupid Christian
Wrong. Its been 5,000 years since God created it. If it was 4.6 billion years old and evolution, as you say, is real then it should be an animal now
The professor was visibly shaken, and dropped his chalk and copy of Origin of the Species. He stormed out of the room crying those liberal crocodile tears. The same tears liberals cry for the poor (who today live in such luxury that most own refrigerators) when they jealously try to claw justly earned wealth from the deserving job creators. There is no doubt that at this point our professor, DeShawn Washington, wished he had pulled himself up by his bootstraps and become more than a sophist liberal professor. He wished so much that he had a gun to shoot himself from embarrassment, but he himself had petitioned against them!
The students applauded and all registered Republican that day and accepted Jesus as their lord and savior. An eagle named Small Government flew into the room and perched atop the American Flag and shed a tear on the chalk. The pledge of allegiance was read several times, and God himself showed up and enacted a flat tax rate across the country.
The professor lost his tenure and was fired the next day. He died of the gay plague AIDS and was tossed into the lake of fire for all eternity.
Semper Fi.

	<TEXT> We're all white on the Ellen Pao and the lack of chemistry between Jake Gyllenhaal and Anne Hathaway, Natalie and Ashton actually make a great writer because his ideas survived long enough to get into a place for all sorts of things wrong with the legality of creating your own life, or how you view your own life, or how they seize upon muscle tissue degradation.

Eh, maybe not in the height department but I can assure you I've grown more than most people will in the more important categories.
My intelligence, for example, has grown to the point where I am now a revered member of my local MENSA branch and have astonished many learned experts in various scientifical fields with insights formed after only a cursory glance at their field of study. I read the entire works of authors such as James Joyce, Albert Camus, Stephen King and George Orwell before my teenage years. I was awarded a delta for the first CMV post I ever made, and I only really argue with people on Reddit for my own amusement.
Perhaps you'd like to hear about my stunning and exponential growth in the weights room, too? How about my success with maidens from all over Europe?
You probably like to make jokes about your height at my expense because it's the only thing you have going for you. So yeah, you might be taller than me, but at the end of the day, do I care? No. I have more important things to worry about, like the one million word novel I'm currently writing, adding to my $50,000 wardrobe, or adding to my impressive list of bullet hell game regional hiscores.

	<TEXT> I'm not sure if you're trolling or just have no idea who I am, but I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt. In addition to almost 7 years as a confessed meme addict, I have moderated the largest meme forum on the Internet (at over 2 million subscribers) for over a year. You think I don't know memes? In that time I have removed over 400posts for not following subreddit guidelines. In addition to my moderation responsibilities I am one of the most active writers on knowyourmeme.com. You think I don't know memes? Then how do I write articles about them on a site called knowyourmeme? Several mainstream blogs have contacted me to ask about the recent meme phenomenon and each has been thankful and enlightened with what I had to tell them. It's not just limited to blogs though. Several companies have asked me to review their meme ads to avoid a failure like Toyota's meme commercial. Just last week a major food company contacted me with a paid offer to help them on a new ad campaign. I declined when I researched the company and saw that they had contributed money to socially conservative groups.
It's safe to say that I am one of the world's foremost experts on memes and in fact there is no one I can think of that has a meme resume as impressive as mine. So please tell me, what are your qualifications to say that I don't know what a meme is?

	<TEXT> So you have figured out that the majority of /r/atheism isn't very happy with religion and believe that religions are pretty silly. You might find some of this shit offensive even. You might even feel that you need to post about how much /r/atheism sucks.

I have a 10 step plan in order for you to correct this issue.

1. Go fuck yourself. This is a crucial step, and will be recommended should you decide to openly voice your concerns about /r/atheism. Might as well get this out of the way so when it is recommended, you can proudly claim 'I've done that already' and the discussion can continue. A broken bottle is ideal, but whatever tool you have available it fine, even if it is a portal gun.

2. Repeat step 1 to ensure completion.

3. Unsubscribe. You don't HAVE to be here, you don't HAVE to read the memes, sagan quotes, and dumbasses on facebook. Red button on the right. Go away, we don't want you.

4. Repeat step 1 again.

5. Understand our user base. If you live in the UK, you might legitimately not understand a LARGE portion of our users. Google the Bible belt. I will wait..... Ok, that's long enough. There are many atheist teens in the Bible belt, whom stay in the proverbial closet to prevent bad shit from happening to them. This includes something as trivial as being cut off from college (which in the US is not a right, but a paid privilege), to something as sever as being thrown in the streets or (in the rare case) murdered. There have been users on here asking for help due to parents wanting to involuntarily commit them to a psyche ward for their atheism. This subreddit is for them to vent.

6. Repeat step 1

7. We have every reason to hate religion. While we don't necessarily hate religious people, we do find their beliefs silly and worth mocking. However, religion is responsible for many deaths in Iran, Sudan, and the Bible Belt, especially among this particular faith known as Christian Science, which believes prayer is a legitimate alternative to MEDICINE and SURGERY, which sometimes ends up killing the unfortunate kid.

8. Repeat step one, one last time.

9. If you are still here and have concerns, discuss. If not, unsubscribe button is on the right, have a nice day and don't forget to go fuck yourself.

10. Go fuck yourself.

	<TEXT> So I was standing in a rather large line at my local Wal-Mart today behind a couple families that I know from when I went to church with my family in year younger. It was the only register open so there wasn't much of another option to get my 12 pack of Mountain Dew for a party I was heading to. I was wondering why the line was going nowhere when I decided to poke my head up front to see what the holdup was. It was a little old lady who didn't have enough for her groceries and she was trying to talk the cashier into letting her get away with being short. This struck me as odd until I found out she was a mere $0.21 short of her purchase. Now all these families were just staring and there was even two making fun of her. I walked up and handed my soda to the cashier, handed him a $5 and told her to keep the change. One of the middle aged women (I knew these people, so I also knew that they all make over 6 digits) grabbed her kid and yelled very loudly, "See that man? He's acting just like Jesus wants us to." For some reason this set me off, so I turned around. I haven't shaved in awhile so I'm rocking some nice scruff, a Slayer shirt, and gym shorts, so it must have been a nice sight. Very loudly, I said "Like Jesus? Ma'am I'm an atheist who makes minimum wage and I was the one who stepped up to help her? Your hypocritical Christianity is an inspiration to us all." As I stormed out, a couple of the cart boys started to whistle and cheer, soon shoppers joined in and even the cashier. I gave a wave and went off with a feeling of accomplishment.

	<TEXT> Listen closely, my fellow brethren: do not despair. today is a dark day indeed. But not all is lost. On the contrary, the only thing that we have lost is the time it will take to build our beautiful, fit community back to what it was. We can ALWAYS rebuild; do not ever forget that, and do not them try to tell you otherwise.
They will taunt.
They will laugh.
They will mock
They will eat. Oh boy, will they eat.
I say to you: ignore them. For they would not be so quick to salt the wound if they thought there were no truths to our stance.
We need your help to piece things back together. Keep doing what you've always done: Post quality content on our sub. And tell everyone you can to flock here, for there is always strength in numbers.
This may have been a harsh blow, but don't forget that we are winning the war! We aren't the ones with heart disease, broken joints, and diabetes. We aren't the ones who have difficulty fitting into airplane seats or breathing unassisted. We aren't the ones who are going to die at 40!
Remember this, and remember it well!
Remember our cause!
Stand together!
And FIGHT ON!
HUZZAH, HUZZAH!

	<TEXT> It should be noted that I've upvoted every single person who's disagreed with me here, as far as I know.

That said.

In 7th grade, I took an SAT test without preparing for it at all, it was spur-of-the-moment, I knew about it about an hour ahead of time and didn't do any research or anything. I scored higher on it than the average person using it to apply for college in my area.

An IQ test has shown me to be in the 99.9th percentile for IQ. This is the highest result the test I was given reaches; anything further and they'd consider it to be within the margin of error for that test.

My mother's boyfriend of 8 years is an aerospace engineer who graduated Virginia Tech. At the age of 15, I understand physics better than him, and I owe very little of it to him, as he would rarely give me a decent explanation of anything, just tell me that my ideas were wrong and become aggravated with me for not quite understanding thermodynamics. He's not particularly successful as an engineer, but I've met lots of other engineers who aren't as good as me at physics, so I'm guessing that's not just a result of him being bad at it.

I'm also pretty good at engineering. I don't have a degree, and other than physics I don't have a better understanding of any aspect of engineering than any actual engineer, but I have lots of ingenuity for inventing new things. For example, I independently invented regenerative brakes before finding out what they were, and I was only seven or eight years old when I started inventing wireless electricity solutions (my first idea being to use a powerful infrared laser to transmit energy; admittedly not the best plan).

I have independently thought of basically every branch of philosophy I've come across. Every question of existentialism which I've seen discussed in SMBC or xkcd or Reddit or anywhere else, the thoughts haven't been new to me. Philosophy has pretty much gotten trivial for me; I've considered taking a philosophy course just to see how easy it is.

Psychology, I actually understand better than people with degrees. Unlike engineering, there's no aspect of psychology which I don't have a very good understanding of. I can debunk many of even Sigmund Freud's theories.

I'm a good enough writer that I'm writing a book and so far everybody who's read any of it has said it was really good and plausible to expect to have published. And that's not just, like, me and family members, that counts strangers on the Internet. I've heard zero negative appraisal of it so far; people have critiqued it, but not insulted it.

I don't know if that will suffice as evidence that I'm intelligent. I'm done with it, though, because I'd rather defend my maturity, since it's what you've spent the most time attacking. The following are some examples of my morals and ethical code.

I believe firmly that everybody deserves a future. If we were to capture Hitler at the end of WWII, I would be against executing him. In fact, if we had any way of rehabilitating him and knowing that he wasn't just faking it, I'd even support the concept of letting him go free. This is essentially because I think that whoever you are in the present is a separate entity from who you were in the past and who you are in the future, and while your present self should take responsibility for your past self's actions, it shouldn't be punished for them simply for the sake of punishment, especially if the present self regrets the actions of the past self and feels genuine guilt about them.

I don't believe in judgement of people based on their personal choices as long as those personal choices aren't harming others. I don't have any issue with any type of sexuality whatsoever (short of physically acting out necrophilia, pedophilia, or other acts which have a harmful affect on others - but I don't care what a person's fantasies consist of, as long as they recognize the difference between reality and fiction and can separate them). I don't have any issue with anybody over what type of music they listen to, or clothes they wear, etc. I know that's not really an impressive moral, but it's unfortunately rare; a great many people, especially those my age, are judgmental about these things.

I love everyone, even people I hate. I wish my worst enemies good fortune and happiness. Rick Perry is a vile, piece of shit human being, deserving of zero respect, but I wish for him to change for the better and live the best life possible. I wish this for everyone.

I'm pretty much a pacifist. I've taken a broken nose without fighting back or seeking retribution, because the guy stopped punching after that. The only time I'll fight back is if 1) the person attacking me shows no signs of stopping and 2) if I don't attack, I'll come out worse than the other person will if I do. In other words, if fighting someone is going to end up being more harmful to them than just letting them go will be to me, I don't fight back. I've therefore never had a reason to fight back against anyone in anything serious, because my ability to take pain has so far made it so that I'm never in a situation where I'll be worse off after a fight. If I'm not going to get any hospitalizing injuries, I really don't care.

The only exception is if someone is going after my life. Even then, I'll do the minimum amount of harm to them that I possibly can in protecting myself. If someone points a gun at me and I can get out of it without harming them, I'd prefer to do that over killing them.

I consider myself a feminist. I don't believe in enforced or uniform gender roles; they may happen naturally, but they should never be coerced into happening unnaturally. As in, the societal pressure for gender roles should really go, even if it'll turn out that the majority of relationships continue operating the same way of their own accord. I treat women with the same outlook I treat men, and never participate in the old Reddit "women are crazy" circlejerk, because there are multiple women out there and each have different personalities just like there are multiple men out there and each with different personalities. I don't think you do much of anything except scare off the awesome women out there by going on and on about the ones who aren't awesome.

That doesn't mean I look for places to victimize women, I just don't believe it's fair to make generalizations such as the one about women acting like everything's OK when it's really not (and that's a particularly harsh example, because all humans do that).

I'm kind of tired of citing these examples and I'm guessing you're getting tired of reading them, if you've even made it this far. In closing, the people who know me in real life all respect me, as do a great many people in the Reddit brony community, where I spend most of my time and where I'm pretty known for being helpful around the community. A lot of people in my segment of the community are depressed or going through hard times, and I spend a lot of time giving advice and support to people there. Yesterday someone quoted a case of me doing this in a post asking everyone what their favorite motivational/inspirational quote was, and that comment was second to the top, so I guess other people agreed (though, granted, it was a pretty low-traffic post, only about a dozen competing comments).

And, uh, I'm a pretty good moderator.

All that, and I think your behavior in this thread was totally assholish. So what do you think, now that you at least slightly know me?

	<TEXT> I honestly think I have a serious problem in regards to this. I have ALWAYS wanted to smells women's panties for as long as I can remember. I remember that their was this hot teachers assistant in my preschool and I always wanted to sniff her chair after she would get up, I came really close to doing it a couple times. Then the first time I actually got a hold of some real panties was at my friends house when I was around 15, his mom would go jogging in the same sweats everyday and leave the thong she had worn right next to the sweats. I still remember that pungent smell of her vagina and that stinky smell of her ass, her vagina would always leave behind globs of cumm on the sweats and panties and I would run my teeth across it to scrape it off and taste her sweet cumm. Oh and by the way my friends mom was HOTT, I don't mean conventional hot I mean pornstar hot, I put a post of her on /r/milf[1] and she got close to 1000 upvotes, me and another friend think she bares a striking resemblance to Lisa Ann. Then at my other friends house I walked into his bathroom and their in the hamper were his sisters dirty panties. I stayed in the toilet for an hour smelling and licking them, THOSE were the best panties I have ever smelled. She was 23 and her panties were these extra small super bright colored hollitster panties and they had streaks on the vagina part but most importantly they had streaks on the ass crack part, not poo stains but rather sweat ass stains. But my most recent venture in smelling panties has been my mother in laws panties, my wifes mother. She's definitely a milf too but more of a real life "hot mom", and every chance I get (lets say her mother in law is sleeping and my wife is in the bathroom I) I rummage through her hamper and take a pair out and steal them to jerk off with. Her mom is pretty hot she's thick but in a good way, she has a flat stomach but a HUGE ass she wears a XL thong. My wife has a huge ass too and I'm talking about actually big (she's from Brazil) but my mother in law's ass is godly, she would put Kim K away no exaggeration. I just love to picture that tight thong swallowed up in her ass and collecting that sweet ass sweat and stench. I'm waaaaaaaaaaaaay more obsessed with the whole ass smell, I just love thinking that the panties have been rubbing up against that particular women's asshole all day. Don't get me wrong I'm not into shit or feces, what I like is the asshole and that stench a women might get from showing in the morning, then doing errands all day and finally working out to get that natural animal like stench oozing out of their ass crack. I really like the smell of a women when she is bent over doggy style and her ass stinks and the smell is wafting up to my nose with every thrust. Every time I have sex with my wife I eat out her asshole EVERYTIME, that is unless she feels really dirty because she hasn't showered has diarrhea or some thing like that. I am currently majoring in psychology and a couple years ago I pinpointed why I have this obsession with panties and the anal area.

	<TEXT> /r/movies[1] is 7.6 million fit college educated middle class cinephiles. If we really wanted to we could invade Hollywood and install a new government. We definitely have the manpower. There are plenty of /r/Movies[2] Veterans here. Plus everyone here knows how to throw a punch with the right hand, from years of watching Fight Club.
Realistically the /r/Movies[3] Reaction Force would be far more effective than half the world's cinephiles. The /r/TrueFilm[4] cinephiles are fucked up on opium. The /r/Flicks[5] cinephiles cant even do jumping jacks. Plus Hollywood has only 8 thousand film critics, the majority of whom are useless paper pushers.
I don't actually support the violent overthrow of Hollywood. I just think its kind of a fun idea conceptualy.

	<TEXT> Y'know, after reading all these Age of Ultron reviews where non-fans complained about how insular, incoherent and confusing the film was, it's starting to seem like the deeper we go into these films the more exclusionary they are going to become to normal fans. 

The inclusion of deep cut Marvel characters like Ulysses Klaw, Ultron, or The Vision just confuses these people. To them these characters seem really undeveloped or shallow, but to fans the characters have already been very, very meticulously developed, so we don't really need all that much exposition to make sense of it. Almost as if the films were made specifically for us.

When the film says "Ultron is going to Wakanda to get vibranium by way of Ulysses Klaw." The normie says to himself, "What? Who? I have no idea what any of those things are or why Ultron is doing that." While the fan says, "Yeah, if Ultron wants to create world peace by wiping out all human life, and vibranium is key to his plan, he may want to hit up Klaw, since he's stolen a shitload of the substance over the years. Makes sense."

Eventually we're going to get to the point where the normies just don't care anymore because they're too confused and don't want to do the homework That's going to result in a drop off in the amount of money these films make. There's still plenty of people out there who will go see these films, and I'm sure that will always justify spending two-hundred million dollars on them, so they're always going to be around, but they're going to become a lot more like actual comics. Impenetrable for people who aren't deeply immersed in this universe. 

You know what I say to that? 

GOOD. 

I don't care if normies are into this shit. I don't really want these characters to be massive, ubiquitous pulp culture phenomenons if that means we have to spend an entire film expositing to people who don't know what's going on. 

These films should be made for the fans. People who aren't hostile to the notion of an extended, interconnected film universe that requires a familiarity with what has come before. Let the normies go back to watching sports, or the Bachelor or whatever the fuck the were into before this stuff came along. 

If they're tired of playing with the toys I've been playing with since I was 6, then I'll take them back. No problem. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Here's the thing. You said a "drywood termite is subterranean." Is it in the same family? Yes. No one's arguing that. As someone who is a scientist who studies termites, I am telling you, specifically, in science, no one calls drywoods subterraneans. If you want to be "specific" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing. If you're saying "termite family" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of Dictyopera, which includes things from to cockroaches to mantises. So your reasoning for calling a drywood a subterranean is because random people "call the eusocial ones termites?" Let's get bees and ants in there, then, too. Also, calling someone a human or an ape? It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works. They're both. A subterranean termite is a subterranean and a member of the Dictyoptera family. But that's not what you said. You said a subterranean is a drywood termite, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the Dictyoptera family termites, which means you'd call mantises, cockroaches and other bugs termites, too. Which you said you don't. It's okay to just admit you're wrong, you know?
