	<TEXT> False, you don't brush your teeth, shower, put on clothes or get out of bed. Sometimes you can't even reach for your phone because it just seems like so much work. You take sleeping pills all day because you literally cannot be awake or living that day. You don't know what to do, you shake and will cry for no reason, probably do something stupid or rude if you are awake, so you think its better to seclude yourself. Plus, you look like shit. It's time to be alone.

The next day you realize you slept through class yesterday and didn't turn in a paper. You start hating yourself, feeling guilty and thinking about how now youre not going to pass the class, then won't graduate, then won't get a good job, the live at home forever, have no love life, be a fat loser, die alone without friends. Your parents yell at you asking why you did that yesterday. All these thoughts together make you even more depressed, so you go to bed, or, you decide to drink the night away. Then, its midnight and you're crying and I texting your ex that doesn't love you, telling him all your problems and how youre a fuck up, how much you love him. Eventually you pass out, wake up, even mor depressed than yesterday (rock bottom keeps going lower and lower). You see the texts. Feel embarrassed. You're in disbelief that you spilled your guts, now he'll never want to be with me again, now that he knows I'm mentally ill. You decide you're going to cut everyone out of your life, the remaining acquaintances you do have.

This all fucks you up and you decide to call into work because you can't be near people today and can't bring yourself to clean yourself up. You feel bad you're letting your coworkers down and leaving them shorthanded. You feel guilty. The cycle repeats.

Taking time to yourself to do something you enjoy, like reading or drawing or fingerprinting or walking through the park.

Lifting weights or anything that strains the body. To get yourself to go to sleep, you're supposed to tighten every part of your body, starting and your feet then moving up. But lifting things, this kind of does it for you and relaxes you. </TEXT>
