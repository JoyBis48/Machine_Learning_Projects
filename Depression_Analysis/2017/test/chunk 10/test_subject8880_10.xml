	<TEXT> This is what I remember. Way back in 2002, I was working in the Pet Department and my job was to catch fish out of the aquarium. The fair was in town and when the fair is in town, it is BATSHIT crazy. All these kids winning goldfish and their parents would go in Wal-Mart to get fish bowls,food,etc. Well, one day after I got off lunch (I was eating at McDonalds in my store because no car) and my stomach was..lets say not playing nice with me. A woman with her Grandson came in with a bag of goldfish and wanted someone to catch a specific one as a mate to the one he won at the fair. I'm off to the floor, they call my name, I go straight to the aquariums. The lady wanted a fish out of the goldfish tank that had a stripe over the eye. Now, mind that the tank had 1000 goldfish and that catching the specific one is time consuming. I'm over at the tanks FOR 4 GOD DAMN HOURS trying my balls off to catch this fucking fish. Her kid is at the tank ohh and ahhing. The Grandparent is over there placing her fingers on the glass THE WHOLE GOD DAMN TIME pointing out this bastard. Stomach made a noise, then I fuckin farted. Loud. I mean it echoed down the aisle. As this gas was rumbling in the bowels of my ass hell, I tried to fake a cough. I farted, fake cough was off by 2 seconds. I didnt do shit but ignore it. I farted, we glanced at each other and no big deal was made. It stunk, I mean worse than dead fish. So, the next day I come in, manager calls me up. I go in, he is asking me questions about me being rude. I'm like..what do you mean? He explained to me that I was being rude in front of a customer. "What?". "How?" No response. I got fired, next day I get a call from a guy I worked with that explained to me that because of my loud, smelly fart I got wrote up and fired. Escorted off the premesis and signed papers saying I will never work with them again. </TEXT>

Me - You still got that Chevy Citation for sale?

Guy - Why the fuck you calling me at 3 AM?

Me - You didn't say what time not to call.

I also would call Sonic and ask if they still had any specials on Big Macs.

	<TEXT> The Star Wars reprint has a black Diamond price box on the cover. I should know, I bought a 3 pack of the first 3 issues of Star Wars in a 3 pack for a buck in the early 90's.
Wish I still had the reprints. I know a comic shop in Jackson,Tn has issue 1 but it's sunburnt. </TEXT>
