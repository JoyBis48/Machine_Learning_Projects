	<TEXT> A series I really dug, that's different than Cosmos, but in the same genre of science docu-series is "Brave New World with Stephen Hawking." However, by far "The Universe" is one of my favorites. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Looks are just one layer of time character. The crunchy candy shell covering the decadent chocolate underneath. What's going to make or break the character for us, is Leto's performance. Of which I have more than enough confidence he can pull off. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I actually really liked season 9. It wasn't the same show, but it had a lot of potential. It should have been its own spinoff, as opposed to being tacked on to the end of the original show. The first time I re-watched the whole series, I was left wanting to see more of those characters. Season 9 may not have been as good as the first 8 seasons, but it could have been. Hell, it's way better than what they tried to do with the interns in season 8. Denise was the only salvageable part of that mess. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Haha, I thought so. However, your eyes are mesmerizing, and your smile is adorable. Whatever you're doing, keep it up. Also, coming from a former fellow emo-kid, even as you grow up, people of all kinds, tend to use that to generalize you. Don't be afraid to keep them on their toes. Let them make that assumption, but throw them a curveball every once in awhile. Leaves them thinking "wow, there's much more to this girl than 'hot emo chick'" </TEXT>
