	<TEXT> It's also a TV Channel in Malaysia costing RM10.60 (2.80 US Dollar)

The cheaper price means that you don't have the VOD option and you are stuck with what they show on the network

http://www.astro.com.my/whats-on/channel/wwe-network-hd/285

As you can see, they are just looping 3 or 4 shows a week. But since  the PPV is cheap (it cost around USD10 before this, so it's now 5x cheaper I just buy it for the PPV) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> On something different, but quite similarly weird when talking about modern F1, Benneton and Schumacher tested an all wheel steering F1 car, where the rear tyres angles inwards when the front tyres is steering.

In theory it should mean the car is more steerable. In practice, it was not faster than a normal car. The system was ditched and the FIA promptly banned it (only two front tyres can steer the car rule)

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Everytime Cena is on commentary, it bores me. He has this calm, droning voice that never changes no matter what happens in the ring. He tries to get people over, but for some reason his timing is off and he cuts off other commentators and tend to talk over them. 

Last night during the triple threat match it was really annoying to hear him. Thank god the match itself is good that he was easily filtered out

There are people like William Regal, that is calm on commentary but makes it work. He managed to convey enthusiasm and character in his commentary no matter how calm he sounds. But not Cena. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Depends on your definition of real. Racing teams change ownership and rights throughout the years that it's hard to really keep track on who carries which legacy. IMO only Ferrari and Williams are still who they are as they were when they started. 

even the current McLaren is actually continuation of Ron Dennis's Project four racing team that merged with the original McLaren racing team but they kept the McLaren heritage. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 1. There should be an incentive to finishing higher, hence why the point gaps will always goes smaller the lower you finishes. 

2. A close point gap means that a consistent driver  a fast driver. You could end up with a driver that does not win any race in the season finishing top. Something that happened once in Moto GP's 125cc category when the champion never won any race that year.


3. Reason 2 was why the current points scoring system was introduced. The previous point scoring system was criticized for not giving the "winningest" driver the most points.  </TEXT>

2 - No TV station wanted the WCW brand. AT ALL

Vince wanted to keep the WCW brand as a seperate entity as his roster was too big. But there were no TV station that wanted to carry it due to the stigma it had. He offered the network that carrying SmackDown at the time to put WCW on SmackDown's slot, but it was quickly shot down. Hence we had that stupid invasion angle and the death of WCW. But we have the roster split down the road, just as Vince wanted </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's a good opinion. but there is a reason LU can pull it off. For one, they are taped for a while back, and hence, why they could produce all those awesome looking camera angles and such, because they have time. Try being live, or taped with a time constraint (taping that is needed to be shown in a few weeks, instead of month for example) and I doubt it would still keep the same feel

Also it's too niche. I for one could still suspend my reality while watching TNA/WWE/ROH, but with LU, you have to watch it like watching a TV series/soap opera. There is no nagging feeling like something would blow up and change the industry, like the pipe bomb, or Jeff Jarret's GFW invading TNA. That reality factor IMO is severely lacking at the moment </TEXT>

Note that they are not actually perfect tho. There are some cases that WWE's style is better. For example when Finn was outside slamming into KO on the barricades, They followed Finn from behind, making it looks slower and less impactful. WWE under Dunn would shot it from the front making it look like it was a high impact move </TEXT>
