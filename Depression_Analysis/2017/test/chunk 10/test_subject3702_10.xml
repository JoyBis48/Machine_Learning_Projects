	<TITLE> account in collections, not on credit report </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-07-15 01:43:21 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I have medical bills from last year that amount to roughly $1000 dollars. I was an idiot, and let them get into collections. 

The same collection agency is dealing with three different amounts, and I received the letters about four months ago. 

I'm now cleaning my credit up, and ran TransUnion and Equifax credit reports, which are not reporting the accounts at all.

**Question:**

I would like to pay up to half of this right now, and pay the rest off in installments. Should I call up the collections agency and just do it, or should I try to receive some sort of writing first that it won't be reported on my credit report?

Thanks! </TEXT>

He can re-release the code under a new license, but it doesn't change the fact that the old repo was forked and modified with the old license.

~~Ir~~regardless, he does have some pirated ROMs on his site, so the morality of this guy is questionable.

ok, fair. But the roms are being distributed to demonstrate the functionality of the emulator, not being claimed as the authors original work. He shouldn't have them up there, but using possesion of GBA roms as a metric for morality may be a bit too sensitive when dealing with an emulator.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Was it vital for the survival of human beings? If not, I'd rather we be in the dark for certain subjects... 

The problem with that line of reasoning is that the nature of knowledge and information doesn't work linearly. Knowing something new about one thing can open up breakthroughs in unrelated fields. 

It's unfortunate, but if we abstained from everything we didn't need we'd be living extremely spartan lifestyles. Cheap clothes, cheap food, cheap energy all come at the expense of unsavory consequences.  </TEXT>

Step 1:

use input type='file' multiple to get the users files into the browser

Step 2:

send these files to the server

Step 3:

on the server, use a library like ffmpeg via php, to convert and echo said files.

Step 4:

When the server sends the response, make the file available for the user to download.

That should help get you going </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Apply to many, many places for a barbacking position. Use friends, friends of friends, family and acquaintances as references and potential leads.

In that position, you'll be working with bartenders. You will be a bitch, doing menial tasks and learning what happens behind a bar. Work hard. Take every shift offered to you. Cover shifts. Be prepared to take criticism. Learn the drinks and the side work of the bar.

 In time, you'll start blurring the lines between barback and bartender. Then you'll be able to pick up -- here and there -- bartending shifts. Using that experience, you'll either A) be able to weasel your way into a bartending shift at the place you're at or B) start applying with actual bartending experience to other bars.

Good luck man. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would go out on a limb and say this:.

They got the TBS deal. It's not hard to imagine, given TBS' s track record for realising potential. J   A have an excellent portfolio. The Twitter campaign was planned to garner support, awareness and viewers for the upcoming show. 

They split with college humor because they might be a) already shooting episodes,  or b) because of conflict of interest / a very busy schedule of writing and shooting the upcoming show. 

That's my guess anyway... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> An honest question:

It's awesome that facebook would pay for and appreciates this kind of exploit reporting... but is what he did technically illegal? 

I know somebody from highschool who found major exploits in the school's network, documented  and then reported them to IT to try to get a job for his senior year.

The IT department head (It was made up of like two/three people) responded by reporting him to the police and he ended up beibg expelled. I'm not really sure what happened to him legally,  but I know it kind of fucked his life up for a bit. </TEXT>
