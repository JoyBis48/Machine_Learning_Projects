	<TEXT> * Check your tyre pressure - Most tyres run 32 PSI. You can run higher (I run mine at 38 PSI) but you will get a bumpier ride.
You can normally find your tyre pressure by the Drivers side door latch. (When you open the door, look at the latch mechanism beside your hip and there may be a sticker denoting your PSI/KPI levels)

* If you're driving in a straight line, and you let go of the wheel, does the car noticeable lurch/start to turn itself to either the left/right in a very noticeable way? Then your wheel alignment is out, and this will be causing uneven wear on your tyres.

* If you don't want to fork out around 70-100 dollars for a wheel alignment, then you can put it off by rotating your tyres - from front right to rear left, front left to rear right and vice versa. (Note: ensure the direction arrows on the sidewall are adhered to!)

* Buy fuel when it's as cold as possible, (first thing in the day, or at night.) fuel expands as it gets hot, as as you pump per litre rather than weight you can save *maybe a litre* over a tank just by topping up during the coldest point of the day.

* 91 vs 95/98* honestly 99% of the time you're not going to notice the difference. I've found on a long journey at 100km/h then I did get an extra 50km from 98 (over a 650km tank) compared to 91 with a 2005 Toyota Caldina. But that advantage would quickly be pissed away as around town the vast majority of your energy is accelerating, in which case the difference isn't so pronounced. Therefore if you're looking save cash 95/98 isn't going to help you!

	<TEXT> It's extremely complicated.

You've got a variety of market forces and different brackets at play which makes for a clusterfuck of opinions.

In one corner you've got the folk who own property in the hot spots, and are watching their investment grow an enviable $1000's of dollars a month.

In another corner you've got the simple fact that people of asian descent dominate our property auctions. 

And another coincidence is this perception is further amplified by the "top sales people" in most realtors again of Asian descent. After 4 years in retail I can say without an iota of racism that Asians buy almost exclusively from Asian salespeople. I've had customer's who walk up to the nearest asian looking sales person and exclusively buy from them. If there were none available, **they would actually have the balls to ask if there were any asian sales people and leave if there weren't!!**.

You've got the devout labour supporters who are simply following the leader by crying foul with the latest stats simply because they have an interest in getting rid of National and supporting Labour.

You've got National Supporters who again are just crying foul because the allegations came from Labour and are loving the racist card in all of this, which is course a giant side show and detracting from Labour's primary message of "Foreign home Ownership" rather than just a good old Chinese bash-up like National are desperately trying to depict.

You've got Labour themselves who are trying desperately to stay relevant in the facing of falling poll results and are willing to post ANYTHING controversial to try and sway the voters by posting potentially defamatory statements against Asians by pigeon-holing people by their last names in an attempt to pull on the public's very hot topic of house prices (Obviously not who are in the first category of watching their investment grow however)

And you've got the young and old or homeless/renters who are rapidly coming to the realisation that no matter what their dream of owning a home is being dashed. 
Whether or not they believe it due to foreign home ownership they just know the National Bank are very very very happily fucking them over with a deep heated coated broom handle by instating LVR resrictions, despite the fact I'd bet my left nut the Banksknow damn well it's the overseas buyers an speculators who are driving up houses prices, but they that's ok because the Bank are still making money hand over fist!

The Government knows damn well there's a problem with speculators and developers (hence the half hearted attempt at a capital gains tax they implemented earlier this year.) however their unwillingness to even look at a register of foreign home buyers should actually show you how desperate they are for the truth not to come out - that our country is very much up for the highest bidder, and the cashed up people are buying up WORLD WIDE and this is affecting the Kiwi's ability to buy a house.

All in all, there's a fucking massive problem, our government are burying their head in the same, our young are being fucked hard with the rising cost of living, coupled with a government who don't give a fuck about keeping jobs on shore, and parents who constantly try and apply their own morals to their offspring without either giving a fuck, or honestly believe it's possible to own your home on your average wage by the time you're 30.

	<TEXT> This coming from the softcock (who will ~~probably~~ hopefully read this.) who [blamed NZ internet](http://www.stuff.co.nz/technology/games/68677940/game-developer-dean-hall-says-new-zealand-broadband-in-the-dark-age) on the inability to run a company in NZ. It's like seriously? You think you're the ONLY NZ company to have this same problem, so you go running to the media and actually **threatening** to take the work overseas. 

And now the cunt actually has the balls to try and hire immigrant anyway!?


He's just an outspoken asshole who's apparently looking to bag NZ in any way shape or form he can!?

**You can't refuse to pay market rates to our budding game developers, and then complain there are no game developers. You fucking hypocritical douche bag.**

Dude, GROW THE FUCK UP. Stop running to the media with your problems, if you have a problem with NZ stop being an asshole, blaming everything you can and threatening to take the jobs overseas. Honestly we're better off without you.

* [For the record with a student loan](http://www.salaries.co.nz/a/salary-tax-calculator/) $35,000 is $27,437 pa cash in hand.
* [Average Rent in Dunedin](http://www.enz.org/house-rents-dunedin.html) 350pw is 18,200 pa.
* Weekly grocery shop (Roughly): 100pw is 5200 pa.
* Weekly power (This is Dunedin, so this is an underestimate!): 50pw 2600 pa.
* Weekly petrol in a very cheap car: 35pw is 1820 pa.

**And you get $-383.. Without insurance, internet, landline or cellphone bills**


 So either that's not a 'living wage' or you will at the least be barely scraping the barrel to survive off that salary! That's not a reasonable wage for someone (who's doing skilled work even breaking into the industry), and it's hardly surprising that he's not able to get any staff! </TEXT>

There are 1.3 million rooftop solar systems in Australia and most households receive publicly-backed rebates to install, but the CEFC has made a priority projects that help people who do not own their own homes, those who live in apartments and community groups to invest in solar"

It's pathetic, we're literally prisoners in our own economy. I don't give a flying fuck if those old fucks are making mega dollars on their 2000 they bought back in 1967 cause realistically that doesn't go into the fucking economy, it goes back to some private property investor fat cat who currently doesn't pay tax on that income. So tell me more how it benefits me (a 28yo male)? It doesn't! 

Fuck the foreign buyers, especially fuck the banks for being greedy cunts, causing the property crisis by loaning money to people who couldn't pay it back (you know the middle class who haven't had a pay rise in years, while ceo's and other fat cats line their pockets with the proceeds of the effort of these people but I digress), then further fucking over the middle class by allowing foreign buyers preference over first home buyers with their LVR restrictions, and I'm just waiting till the government blames first home buyers on the prices flying upwards, just wait it will happen! It already has over in Australia!

Edit: And more downvotes without saying why. Of course my elders who own houses are thoroughly enjoying this, their house prices are inevitably increased which is good for them, however they either don't care, or are blind to the problems facing **their** sons and daughters.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So.. if Gerry had openly refuted the claims, had the dinner in an open and honest manner declaring everything along the way with nothing to hide I wouldn't have had a problem, neither would have anyone else. 

It was only 1 guy complaining from presumably quite a large list of people he invited.

The ultimate question is did he really have to cancel an entire sponsored dinner (probably at great cost to the booking fee etc) over 1 sour man accusing him of being cohorts with the company who won the contract over him? 

Or did the guy make him realise it actually maybe wasn't a good look, and could appear as a conflict of interest, so cancelled it, while blaming the guy as a scapegoat? 

I'm leaning towards the latter, judging by his outburst flying off at the guy about it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sorry, I should explain! They charged the restocking fee on a mate who bought from them, a Maximum VII Hero, and a Samsung M.2 SSD. the Maximus doesn't accept SATA M.2's (not that you could tell from the specs!) and so he had to return it, and they demanded a 35% cut of a $300 dollar item, and he swapped it out with a SATA SSD.

He should have argued it, as really he bought every other component from them as he told the retailer his purpose (by having every single component for a PC in his cart) that he was building a PC and that the HDD he had selected was not compatible with that motherboard. Therefore the item was not fit for purpose.

It's a bit of a gray area, but I reckon he should have argued they didn't warn him when boxing the components, or even have it explicitly state that while the motherboard has an M.2 slot it does not accept SATA based M.2 drives, only PCIe based M.2 drives. (Confused yet?)

However he didn't argue and just took the $100 whack to his wallet! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I see what you're saying, but to a layman you're setting yourselves up to fail when you continually award every single large project to the same company.

No company is beyond corruption as the Public found out about [Projenz](https://www.sfo.govt.nz/n494,27.html) not so gracefully last year. And no company is too big to fail either, which would leave Chch people extremely in the lurch as most of the work going on is with the same company. That to me just doesn't make sense.

However (to me anyway) the whole point of tender is to ensure the work is done by the ~~best~~cheapest not whoever's the biggest. 

Just saying they got it because they have no competition is a bit silly as you're kinda resigning the industry to ensuring they're their own worst enemy by continually giving work to one company on the basis of well they are the biggest.. 

However above all he's a Politician for goodness sake, and grown man who should be able to stick by his decisions.

Furthermore, had he not cancelled it, this more than likely would have been a non-event. However, by cancelling the event, after having invited journalists he knew very well (or his PR team should have told him..) that this was going to get more scrutiny than warranted.

The accusations being thrown at him by someone who lost an extremely lucrative contract so of course they are going to be pissed about it, and say stupid things. However he really didn't need to respond like this. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes, you're right, but it's not much the lack of support from the businesses, bear in mind 99% of them don't own the land, rather lease it. And those who lease it only buy what's available.

This needs to be addressed with a building code change - for X amount of people the building can hold, Y% must be available for parking.

However as I've pointed out before, what sounds better? 

"For Sale $1M Office building fits 500 staff, 300 car parks."
"For Sale $1.3M Office building fits 900 staff."

The latter of course, therefore in order to get as much profit from their developments they don't want a minimum carpark allowance, therefore as developers are well and truely one of the biggest campaign boosters this will not happen.

So long story short, council is being an ass. Developers force the problem to the council. And the little guy loses. Once again. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would agree with you if Samsung weren't a pack of fuckwits who love crippling their old hardware by refusing to update the software suite. For instance, shit like Themes, or Camera2 api support should have been released for the s5, but Samsung, being the pile of cunts they are have chosen to deliberately save those for the newer devices, despite stuff like themes being device agnostic. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Very muchly, I agree WLG were gimped from the start, but having spent a week there recently they aren't doing too badly with what they've got.

On the other hand, getting from Riccarton Avenue for instance to the carpark beside the bus Exchange, you have to go through about 5 set of lights, and cross at least 3 lanes of traffic (at a time.) which is nearly impossible for someone who doesn't 100% know where they're going. Which is stupid, road's should be intuititive and easy to use.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you! Exactly. They can't just tout a lower reduced tolerance as a crash reduction parameter, while it may be a factor, it's one of many in regards to whether people crash. 

I get it, speeding past a school = dangerous.
Speeding (~110) on the open road when in a passing lane = acceptable behaviour

However while they do they do the occasional blitz outside schools, I've personally only seen a speed camera van down fendalton road on a monthly basis. Never once have I seen a police presence outside Burnside highschool, despite the fact I drive past daily when parents are dropping their kids off.

	<TEXT> So people can's just slam on the brakes past the speed cameras. That's quite a good idea (from a scientific point of view.)

Does it work though? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree, but cars and drivers don't/can't just slam on the brakes to go the posted sign limit if the system thinks that now's a good time to change it to 60. 

I can only hope there will be a buffer zone - e.g. the system waits a second before pinging people for speed, as people who go past it right as it changes from 60-40 but have no hope of physically seeing the sign change.

I know it's a rare situation, but there's a lot of potential for abuse from the operators to change the speed and ping people immediately. </TEXT>
