Most of our free-trade agreements have increased our trade deficits with other countries. Will TPP reduce this deficit? How can TPP be the most progressive trade bill according to Obama, yet conservative enough for Republicans? Supposedly, all the rules and standards will be enforceable, so companies don't outsource as often and countries with those outsourced jobs have to improve conditions.

"we want our country to be the best!" 

"we want to defend our country from foreign influences like culture, immigration, etc"

	<TEXT> Also, Americans are more willing to outsource their industries to other states than to other countries because it is "American". Even then, states still campaign on a protectionist agenda during election times. 

Like "Support this industry because we want to keep _fill in state_ jobs in this state!"  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No. Midterm elections are based on states. The last midterm elections was focused mostly on rural states. Democrats lost their chances with North Carolina, Georgia, and Colorado. (maybe LA and Iowa?) Those should have gone Democrat, if they campaigned well enough in the major cities. Cities tend to vote Democratic. Even then, those states are "purple" on the national level.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We don't have a multiparty system, so it is based on some states. Also states tend to vote in the same way as they do in general elections. 

Red States = Vote Red for Senators
Blue States = Vote Blue for Senators

	<TEXT> Easy way to defund highways. REPEAL THE FEDERAL GAS TAX, so the Highway Trust Fund has no revenues from the gas tax, so now you need to find an alternative revenue plan.

Terrible Idea. Just saying. We should increase the federal gas tax by 5 to 10 cents.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Clinton only needs to worry about the moderates dividing up her primary votes. (Webb, Chafee, and maybe Biden). She also needs more progressives in the race to divide up the progressive vote from Sanders. The best outcome for Democrats is to find a candidate neither Clinton nor Sanders, so Republicans need to think of a new strategy in the general election, but not too leftwing for Republicans to play "moderate". Of course, Clinton is still a viable candidate. Don't get me wrong.  </TEXT>

The question is do you need value it more in July/August or you can wait until the fall for Satellarknights.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am not sure, if you can tell, who actually needs it the most economically, since anybody can respond saying that they need it and write up life experiences. Either way, it is your call on the pick. haha

I could talk my about my interest for it and write an essay long reasons of why I would deserve it for reasons a,b,c,d, etc. But I want to say that I am a normal yugioh player. I do have cards, of course who wouldn't with all those commons/rares/and the occasional super from the packs. I have a roid deck from when I was younger, cyber, and batteryman deck, so it is not really "meta" per say nor beginner "starter" deck. This is my first 6 ish months of attending locals and I would say that it is a great way to meet new people, have a good time, trade with others, and duel others for enjoyment. It is a great experience, since I couldn't really play casually yugioh with old long time friends, who got away from yugioh with their own niche/interests, etc.

Anyways, you are a great person, who is willing to help other members of the yugioh community. Thanks for your support! (Flattering the person lol)

	<TEXT> High-Density doesn't really occur until you have the population density and budget to maintain it. Business Growth will reach max demand when you have over 100k people with a good mayor rating with many services and high traffic congestion. The biggest problem is high commute time and lack of jobs when you are in high density mode. It becomes a problem because people abandon your city and causes a recession. Your industrial areas need to be in manufacturing + hightech mode as well. </TEXT>
