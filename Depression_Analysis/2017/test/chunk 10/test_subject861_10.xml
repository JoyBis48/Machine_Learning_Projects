	<TITLE> Just finished The Catcher in the Rye for the first time. Did the ending leave you feeling optimistic or pessimistic? [Spoilers] </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I think Salinger intentionally left the end of Holden's story as an ambiguous one that could be interpreted one of two ways:

**1) Optimistic:** Holden is doing much better, enjoying life more, and genuinely missing people. He will be headed to a new school soon and he is looking forward to that.

**2) Pessimistic:** Holden is just as deluded and disconnected as ever before. He thinks he is getting out of the psych ward soon, but it is just a false hope. The telling of his story shows the current state of his mental health, and it is not a good diagnosis.

*How did you interpret the conclusion of The Catcher in the Rye?* </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not sure if you've decided yet, but here is the opinion of a mega fan who has played each game in the series:


Begin with  **Final Fantasy X**. 


The graphics are new enough to not be offensive or distracting to modern gamers. The story and world are both beautiful works of art. The cast of characters is unique while each party member still holds traditional JRPG roles. It's the first voice-acted Final Fantasy, so there are some flaws there, but still a great game overall.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you /u/Anatidaephobic_Duck for the source! I have made a brief list below of the potentially noticeable benefits of taking Fish Oil from the link you provided. Hopefully it will help others if they have the same question:

* Can stimulate brain activity.
* Can help combat muscle soreness.
* Supports healthy cholesterol.
* Can increase and strengthen bone density.
* Can benefit mood as it supports levels of serotonin.
* May help to balance blood pressure. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have been taking Triple Strength Omega-3 Gold (1,000 mg EPA+DHA per gel) once or twice a day for a couple of weeks now. 

I'm not a huge supplement guy at all, but have read that taking a regular dose of fish oil is beneficial. So, I jumped on the bandwagon and got some high quality stuff. 

Should I be noticing any kind of change or difference in anything?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Guys, our bunny's shedding is OUT OF CONTROL! 

It's not coming out in clumps and she isn't acting ill so I don't think that she is sick or anything. And it has only been going on for two weeks now. We just think that she is shedding her winter coat in preparation for summer. But it has never shed this much. 

There are flurries of bunny fur flying around the room. When we pet her, our hands look like hairy gloves. Her cage now has carpet.

**Is it normal for bunnies to shed this much!?** </TEXT>

	<TEXT> All of creation groans and suffers and has been subjected to futility (Romans 8:22). Those that have faith in God have been promised a day coming where sickness, corruption, and all groaning will cease. 

For the believer in Christ, how could one afflicted as much as Peter *not* hold on to something as promising as that? For those in Christ, God has promised to guide all suffering for the good of his people (Romans 8:28). 

Peter, and those like him, might just have the audacity to believe that their life here on earth, as short and painful as it might be, is just the beginning of their existence. And what was not afforded to them here in this life, will be richly given to them in the next.
