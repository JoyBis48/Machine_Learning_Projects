	<TEXT> I didn't say they are all victims of child abuse, I'm sure many are not, but its clear to see there are lots of people there who are. The whole 'Nmom' or 'Ndad' thing is used in all kinds of psych forums and support groups to highlight the abuser, I just found it strange you felt compelled to say you found that to be 'crap'. They need help and support not a slap in the face.  </TEXT>

You hate the short hand terminology used by victims of child abuse to discuss their experiences..? That's what you took from that sub? What the hell. </TEXT>
