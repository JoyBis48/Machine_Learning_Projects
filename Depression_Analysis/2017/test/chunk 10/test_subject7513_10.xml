	<TEXT> The fact that he's "new" isn't an issue to me I want to see what he plans to DO. He needs to release a game plan and pledge to stick to it.

I want the guy who says here is how I'm putting it out. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Too many rules, too much sensitivity and virtually no subscribers. A good concept dying from over regulation and knee jerking. Supports both open discussion and restricting speech as if that isn't a direct example of doublethink. A sad waste of a decent overall concept. </TEXT>
