	<TEXT> I love this. Reminds me of the JFK quote about being a liberal. 

"If by a "Liberal" they mean someone who looks ahead and not behind, someone who welcomes new ideas without rigid reactions, someone who cares about the welfare of the people-their health, their housing, their schools, their jobs, their civil rights and their civil liberties-someone who believes we can break through the stalemate and suspicions that grip us in our policies abroad, if that is what they mean by a "Liberal", then I'm proud to say I'm a "Liberal. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> this is a little excessive, but I think the point that u/MrFactualReality is trying to make is that Bernie has stood by his policies for his entire career. He marched on Washington with MLK, he has fought for LGBT rights since the seventies, he was/is against the Iraq War, he is against TPP. Sanders stands by his views and does not flip-flop. I think Hillary with TPP is what definitely sold me on Bernie, she took awhile to respond to it (and still has not?), while Bernie came out against it since the whole debate started. I also see her more as a moderate than Bernie, which is why Bernie appeals to me more, as I am more of a progressive. One last point, the whole 2 billion dollar fundraising goal by Hillary is not something I am a fan of. I think these are the points that u/MrFactualReality was trying to make, but was taking a much more rash stance against her. </TEXT>
