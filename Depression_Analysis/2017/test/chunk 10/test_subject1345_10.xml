	<TEXT> Hey guys, Celtics fan here pulling hard for the Rockets to win it all. Huge Harden fan. I'm wondering if anybody has a stat of how many total mid range jumpers the Rockets took during the regular season. I know they don't take many, even less before Josh Smith, but if anybody has the total that'd be sweet. Go Rockets! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I just think I'd rather have him getting everyday at bats instead of sitting on our bench with Clint Robinson and Danny. I'd rather him getting the consistent at bats even if it is against AAA pitchers. What do you guys think? </TEXT>
