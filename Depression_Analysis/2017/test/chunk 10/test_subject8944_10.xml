	<TITLE> Just saw Southpaw- thoughts on the movie and Jake's career [SPOILERS] </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-07-22 08:38:16 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Just got back from a special screening that AMC did where they sent me two free tickets. First I will say that right before the movie began, I checked the ratings and saw it was at 54% on RT. Disappointing so my hopes were not high.

But that movie was amazing. The raw emotion that Jake showed was extremely intense the entire film. This was not a movie about boxing, it was a movie about an emotional journey of a man.

As the trailer spoils, Rachel McAdams dies. This happens pretty early in the film and the rest is a semi-poorly written script on his downward spiral and redemption. While I was not a fan of the writing, Rachel and Jake both shined bright.

If you've been watching the new True Detective season, you've seen a side of Rachel McAdams that she hasn't shown before. This is another. Rachel's character is an extremely realistic, semi-trashy girl who plays the part perfectly. When she shrugs when Jake looks at her in between rounds in the first match, it portrays a girl who grew up with Jake's character and does not love, but lives with his career out of necessity. She never celebrates the huge money but clearly enjoys it, nearly to a fault. The way she played the character was perfect for the background they gave.

As for Jake, it was a brilliant performance. The way he acted in Rachel's death scene was perfect. While the death itself was not particularly realistic, Rachel's reaction and the way Jake held her and talked to her was more realistic than I've ever seen in any movie. It showed the pure fear he had for losing someone he'd grown up with. It showed how much he depended on her. It made me shed a few tears.

Jake's character was played as a hyper-emotional, dumb kid, who grew up in the foster system. He nailed it at every turn. Meeting his new boxing trainer, perfect. Frustration with his comeback, perfect. Dealing with his daughter in uncharted territory, perfect. He truly got into this character's head and the dedication to his work was evident. He lived and breathed this character every second of the film.

This was a character that Jake had never played before. While I thought his worst performance was Source Code, where he didn't show much at all, he added another masterful performance to his collection here. Between Nightcrawler, Enemy, Prisoners, End of Watch, Zodiac, Jarhead, Brokeback Mountain, Bubble Boy, Donnie Darko, October Sky, and now Southpaw, Jake Gyllenhaal is truly one of the most versatile actors of our generation. It is truly a pleasure to see him perform- especially when we have actors who play basically the same character at every turn (Michael Cera, Liam Neeson, Kevin Hart, Melissa McCarthy, etc.).

My biggest gripe in the movie was probably that he literally was a southpaw fighter for one second of the entire film, and the lone reference to being a southpaw was of no significance whatsoever. But if you're not a big fight fan, you likely wouldn't notice that anyway.

If I could rate a movie just on the raw performance of the lead actor, I'd give it a 10/10. Unfortunately the writing was weak and some of the secondary characters were weak/underdeveloped (the random extra death, 50 Cent's performance and Forest Whitaker to an extent), so I'll give the movie an overall 6.5/10. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> To put it in perspective:

The closest states, by percentage vote, between Democrat and Republican, in the 2012 election:

North Carolina- R

Florida- D

Ohio- D

Virginia- D

These are the true "toss-up" states. Every other state was more than 5 percentage points apart.

To put this in perspective, the Democrat for 2016 can lose every single one of those states and still achieve the 270 votes necessary. So basically, Virginia is decently important, only if the Republicans make some headway on the more solidly Democratic states, including Colorado, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, or Iowa (and it just gets more unrealistic from there).

	<TEXT> You have to look at not just the lawfulness of the situation but the reality of the situation.

The reality is, any clerk who denies marriage certificates to gay couples is likely in an area where they are surrounded by like minded people. This person will not get fired immediately because who will the person denied complain to? The clerk's boss, who may say too bad? The person denied will have to hire a lawyer and file an action against the county.

Contrast this with the reality of your Muslim clerk. What are you picturing? A Muslim who is surrounded by non-Muslims? In such a case, the woman would complain to the clerk's boss and the person would be quickly fired. However, if surrounded by like-minded Muslims, the exact same thing as the first scenario would play out.

Your premise is picturing two different situations. The bottom line is, if clerks are surrounded by like-minded people, it will likely take attorney action. If not surrounded by like-minded people, the boss will quickly correct the action. It really has nothing to do with being against gay marriage/Muslims, other than the fact that one is more prevalent in our country. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You can't. I was in this situation where my parents kicked me out of the house midway through my senior year in high school, and when I applied for financial aid, I couldn't because my parents would not let me see their tax return.

I applied for an independent override at my school but was denied because I didn't meet their very strict requirements- including physical abuse by a parent with corroborating police reports. In short, it's not gonna happen in your situation, given what you've described.

What I did was wait until the year I turned 23, when you get automatic independent status.

What your kid can do is community college in the meantime that does not require loans. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I see a bunch of answers that do not QUITE answer what I perceive your question, OP.

So here's what would happen, despite how unlikely. First, as others have said the amendment cannot be unconstitutional by definition if it passes. But let's say it passed and SCOTUS said it WAS unconstitutional. Well then according to them, the amendment is invalid. However, it seems likely that the Executive branch would be unlikely to enforce such a decision because of the overwhelming support.

It really comes down to the fact that each govt entity only has as much power as its people bestow upon it. </TEXT>

SCOTUS decisions ARE the law and therefore everything they write in majority opinions are their lawful interpretation of the Constitution. So you cannot say they can make any decision that is unlawful. Again, I cite to Marbury v. Madison for this contention. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> YES! If a majority opinion of the Supreme Court says something is so, then legally it is the supreme law of the land. That's how our country works! See Marbury v. Madison for context of this phenomenon.

Also I'm fine removing the word "implied" because it does not LIMIT the text of the 10th Amendment, whereas your adding of the word explicitly does limit the text. I'll cite to the Necessary and Proper Clause to show that our Constitution grants implied powers. </TEXT>

And to be honest, that type of language does not matter at all. When we study cases in class, they only leave the relevant parts and cut out 90% of the text that reiterates or is useless in changing the previous status quo. Only a very small portion of future lawyers and legislators in America will even read the flowery portions of the opinion. Not to mention how salty his dissent was. Why is he allowed to use unprofessional language and not the majority? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You are factually incorrect. To quote the text of the 10th Amendment: "The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people."

It says nothing about the powers not EXPLICITLY granted to the federal govt being reserved for the states. Therefore, any implied powers are also reserved for the federal govt. Since the power to regulate marriage on the basis of sex has been implied by the majority opinion today, it is therefore deemed to have been one of the powers of the federal govt since the 14th Amendment passed, on which the decision is based. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For the record I'm in law school now and actually right in the middle of taking my Constitutional Law course this Summer.

I think it's very fair to summarize as 14th v. 10th. The hard part about the justices wrapping their heads around saying that gay marriage is legal is that they are not granting new rights but merely interpreting the Constitution as saying that these rights were granted when the 14th Amendment was passed and are merely being recognized now.

I just finished reading the majority and the dissents and in one of the dissents, I think it was Scalia's, the author says that by interpreting the 14th Amendment as granting the rights of gay marriage, the majority is contending that they see something that every past SCOTUS justice has missed in the past and how insulting it is to those past great justices. The author then goes on to list these great justices and how by finding that this right exists, every state from the passage of the 14th to 2003, a total of 135 years has been missing this right.

This is a somewhat disingenuous argument as justices can only judge the cases in front of them, and I am not aware of any cases regarding the rights of same sex couples to marry until very recently. And so, these justices have not missed this interpretation as it was never presented to them. The states however, have missed this interpretation. At that comes in the 10th Amendment. Since it is generally understood that states regulate marriage, it seemed natural that they would determine who could participate in such institution. However, they did not anticipate that this interpretation would be an infringement of civil rights.

Therefore, I believe you are correct in saying that because the states believe they have the rights to regulate marriage from the 10th Amendment, but SCOTUS has stepped in and said that when there is an infringement of civil rights, the 14th rules. And by the fact the federal law overrules state law, it is lawful for SCOTUS to interpret the Constitution to bestow these rights of marriage upon all citizens. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I see this all the time on reddit, but I truly do not believe he is electable in the general. I have not seen any polls of Sanders vs Republican candidates so I base this instead on statistical evidence showing that 50% of Americans refuse to elect a Socialist (http://www.gallup.com/poll/183713/socialist-presidential-candidates-least-appealing.aspx).

Now I love Sanders' viewpoints and think he'd make a great president. But he openly says he is a socialist, and looking at the evidence shows America is not ready for a socialist president.

Therefore, I say that if I voted for Sanders in the primary, and others do as well, he may win, and therefore likely lose the general election. Thus, I will vote for Clinton because that is the avenue most likely to not have a Republican president. I look at the lesser of evils. While I am not so fond of Clinton, I view a potential Republican president as far worse. </TEXT>
