	<TEXT> All I can say is wow. Jake Gyllenhaal is unrecognizable from his character in Nightcrawler and did a phenomenal job which just goes to show the range he can achieve. While the plot is a little predictable, the movie really is great and the performances are very believable (especially from the daughter, Oona Laurence). On a final note, James Horner's score was amazing and really added to the feel of the whole movie. As someone who's not really into sports films, this movie really was wonderful and I recommend you all go see it if you get the chance. </TEXT>
