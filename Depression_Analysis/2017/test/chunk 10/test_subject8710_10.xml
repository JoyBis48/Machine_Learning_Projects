	<TEXT> so here is the idea with a spoiler to my movie idea. so you have Adam Sandler in a final destination type movie and he goes on this roller coaster. hes the only one on the roller coaster and it crashes and everyone dies except for him. so he is trying to figure out why people think he is dead and at the end of the movie it turns out it is Vince Vaughn and he just watched the accident live and believed he was Adam Sandler. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> see the new blitzcrank really just made the blitzcrank express for me you get homeguards on desired boots talisman of Ascension and activate W. if you have the right masteries when you are supposed to get slowed you are still going your normal speed or faster depending on runes and stuff. this can allow you to carry if you have good pulls because you will always be with the team able to run in and out.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> pantheon is still the same lane bully its not required he have his ult to gut an entire team. however if you want to talk what we could do to balance the nerf it would be simply to lower the CD on it. i don't believe pantheon needs more power its already insane how well he does early to mid game. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> litterally just dont think about it to much the worse thing you can do to yourself in ranked is to get anxious. i know it will be hard to not get anxious i still do around promos but if you can handle it you will be in full concentration.

Tips

* look at enemy champions and try to remember all their abilities and how they synergize in team fights in comparison to yours.

* think about how much more experience you have with certain champs whether they are supports or carries.

* before reaching the lane try to think of a good build for the game if you are playing a diverse champion.

these are just things i have done to calm down in all my games other things i do is verbally talk out loud about what i do works alot for me. </TEXT>
