Certainly not - it's a question of how one goes about reaching people.  Our goal is to get Bernie elected.  They may have an obligation to be more thoughtful and listen better and be more patient, as you say --- but, in the end, who has what obligation is less important than building bridges and getting allies.  

And, honestly, those of use who aren't black can't really understand o their experience.  What I do know is that being black in America is traumatic, and even if we didn't have the larger more important goal of getting the right person elected, we still ought to cut them some slack.  

**TL;DR Let's focus on building allies, not who is in the right or wrong**

	<TEXT> Getting frustrated and becoming defensive isn't going to help Bernie get elected.  That is our common goal.  We need to understand where they're coming from --- reach out, embrace them --- admit the candidate's mistakes *and then* point out the good work he's done.  

Just dismissing BLM and calling the protestors childish (which I've seen several people here do) is a sure path to losing this crucial demographic - which is incredibly stupid because we are on the same side.  

I'm not black, but if I experienced a fraction of what black friends do in their daily lives, I'd be perpetually enraged.  A bit of understanding and humility goes a long way to creating allies.  That is what it's all about.  Let's stop complaining about our frustrations with others who share the same cause ---  and start reaching out instead. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  David Axelrod, the Obama campaign strategist who was a senior White House adviser during the crisis years, said Sanders-style criticism ignores the reality of the economic crash. There was a constant tug and pull between the need to discipline an industry whose excesses had triggered the crisis and keeping the system from collapsing, which would have exacerbated an already reeling economy, he said. Senators dont face such conundrums. Presidents do.

Too Big to Fail is an even bigger problem than before the bailout.  All David Axelrod is proving is why he and the rest of Washington need to be swept out. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I mean dismissing the protest as just "a group of juvenile and rude bunch".  

Why is the issue closed?  If this affects whether Bernie can win, I think it's foolish to ignore it.   

You should read Chris Savage's post:

 Sitting in the middle of this maelstrom was a fascinating experience. I, like many of the others there, was initially irritated by the protestors. I was there to hear the candidates and was frustrated that they werent being heard. Even a bit angry, in fact. These are your allies, I thought. Why on earth are you attacking them? Why are you disrupting an event where the people there are sympathetic to your cause?

 Frustration. Anger. Being silenced.

 Frustration.

 Anger.

 Silenced.

 Talked over.

 Ignored.

 Every single one of these emotions that ran through my white privileged brain in the first few moments of the protest until I was slapped across the face with what I was being forced to confront. Every single one of these emotions are felt acutely and painfully every single day by racial minority groups in our country. **But, instead of being inconvenienced by not being able to hear a politician speak, they face them in the context of being slaughtered in the streets by the police officers who are tasked to protect them, incarcerated in astonishingly disparate numbers, and blamed for not being able to escape from the prison of poverty that holds far too many of them in bondage.**

Which is covered in CrooksAndLiars:

http://crooksandliars.com/2015/07/about-netroots-nations-town-hall

 If a candidate can't acknowledge his/her weaknesses and change them, you have a weak candidate who will grow weaker over time. (Yes, he incorporated some extra language in his stump speech, and that's good. But he still didn't listen at that time.)

 Whatever I may think of Martin O'Malley (and my personal jury is out on him), his response was certainly better than crossing his arms and leaving angry. He screwed up, acknowledged he screwed up, and then engaged.

 As for Sanders, he had an opportunity and completely missed it. That doesn't make him a bad person or a bad candidate or a bigot or anything else. It makes him a candidate who missed a golden opportunity to close the gap with people who aren't connecting with him or his message, regardless of whether he has been an advocate for the meta-issues which affect them.

	<TEXT> Bernie's speech and the interruption is here:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHhrvKlZyS4

When Bernie turns to address the issue, he immediately launches into economic issues.  This is *part* of the story, but it doesn't represent the burning pain that the African American community experiences.  Economics is too abstract. He was definitely off key from my perspective (and you can see from my posting history that I'm a huge supporter).  

What Bernie should have said is: "BlackLivesMatter is about the dehumanization of an entire community.  It's a continuation of a racist legacy in this country and we need to recognize that.  We need to recognize it, we need to admit it, we need to apologize for what was done to African Americans and we need to stop it."

He should then talk about why the Civil Rights movement mattered (and delicately mention his role and that he was arrested), and that we need to continue that same struggle for civil rights.  

Bernie needs to put that out there, and connect on a visceral level like he does on the issues in the rest of his problem, before he goes on to addressing his technical solutions.  His technical solutions are pretty good responses, but he needs to position them as addressing the issue of dehumanization.

1. We can reduce Police brutality by introducing community policing
2. An essential component of human dignity is being able to make a living, and that is why we should make a commitment to addressing chronic under employment in minority communities

	<TEXT>  So now we're talking about a different issue than the conflict of interest. Unless your point is that this was a bullshit excuse meant to cover the fact that Holder was unwilling to prosecute former clients.

Yes, this is my main point.

 Frankly, I think those are legitimate concerns. 

Ok. That  is the first time you've said that.  IMO, you're part of the problem if you think those are not legitimate concerns.  You gave that impression until now.

 Getting justice against the evil bankers who destroyed our economy, or however you'd like to cast it, 

So I see you're back to sneering at me.  The fact that you seem unconcerned, and a trifle amused by the demand for justice does make me suspicious again.  Crimes which go unpunished are repeated.  But, if you're on the side of the industry or the DOJ, I suppose it's much easier to just characterize critics as wanting some kind of absurd hippie justice.

 would be cold comfort for the people who would suffer if, say, Goldman Sachs was overburdened (let alone forced out of business) by fines and criminal liability. 

Well now, that does sound suspiciously close to Lanny Breuer's reasoning, the Too Big To Prosecute policy.  Should Enron have stayed in business? How about Arthur Anderson?  But I guess you've already said you think it's a concern, so I'll let it go.

 For one thing, setting aside for a moment whether I've watched the video, I think it's appropriate to say you are being unfair, to use your word, to tune me out, seeing as I think I've demonstrated I'm not an idiot

Idiocy wasn't the issue.   Lanny Breuer is probably a smart guy, but he's clearly part of the problem.  (Would you agree?)  I was tuning you out because you gave all indications (until now) that you supported his policies.

  But if you think your comments clearly prove that Holder's DOJ failed, perhaps in bad faith, to prosecute a bunch of individuals that it had a case against, I have no idea where you're getting that.

No, I think they failed in their duties to investigate so that prosecutions were possible.  They soft-gloved these companies.  That by itself is *the* problem.  That  Covington had numerous cases before DOJ during Holder's tenure and was keeping his seat warm creates a picture of impropriety.  Obviously, I'm not claiming to *prove* Holder's motive, but his associations combined with the clear dereliction of duty at his DOJ creates a picture of regulatory capture, and that erodes trust in government.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT>   and I hope I've made my point that if you treat "Wall Street defense firms" as toxic,

Well, I conceded earlier that isn't really the heart of the issue.  The problem is that Holder's staff *refused to investigate*  and refused to prosecute based  on criteria like "how it would hurt innocent employees and shareholders".  (That is almost a direct quote, if you'd read what I wrote in my comment).

Luckily, you get to dismiss me as "part of the problem" and tune out anything I might possibly say, because obviously I'm just a shill who couldn't possibly contribute anything of value

Don't whine at me that I'm being unfair when you're too lazy not just to watch the video, but even to read the short blog post I referenced that gives a precis of the video, or even, obviously to lazy to read the text in my actual comment.  There's more than enough in there to make my point.   

If you're reflexively defending the revolving door, and refusing to even consider what someone is trying to show you, then yes, you are part of the problem.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Matt Taibbi is a joke... He also has no standard of evidence - 

Good "argument".  Are you a joke too?  You've presented no evidence at all.

Failure of oversight is something that's very hard to put someone in jail for because you have no affirmative acts. You certainly can't blame the top executives who don't actually monitor individual transactions.

Why did HSBC not terminate its links with the Al Rajhi in 2005? The answer lies in what was then put in place in Afghanistan to generate large amounts of cash. When it comes to opium/ heroin and offshore banks, Britain rules supreme. In 2005, poppy fields in southern Afghanistan began to bloom, and it became evident to the bankers and the geo-politicians of Britain and the US that cash to support the financial centers and the terrorists could be made right there.

 HSBC actively circumvented rules designed to block transactions involving terrorists, drug lords, and rogue regimes.  In one case, two HSBC affiliates sent nearly 25,000 transactions involving $19.4 billion through their HBUS [HSBCs U.S. affiliate] accounts over seven years without disclosing the transactions links to Iran.

I get it that you're a big fan of banking sector criminals.  The question is why.  Are you an Obama zealot?  Someone who works in banking?  Or are you just a troll? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You're arguing for rationality, and let's assume for a minute that regional origin doesn't matter to someone's performance in the role, but that it does matter for elections.  Are you arguing that a politician shouldn't care that a poorly chosen running mate will reduce the chance winning the election?  That seems an absurd and self-defeating attitude.  Logic tends to eliminate candidates who think like that.

Second, it's not clear that regional origin isn't important to the role.  Politicians are connected through networks, and those networks, as for all of us, are likely to be regional.  The fact is that the regional advantage in elections is probably reflective of regional connections and regional connections are important to regional concerns  being considered.  That is "political" thinking. </TEXT>

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/05/16/foreclosure-fraud-audit-false-claims-act_n_862686.html

 The five separate investigations were conducted by the Department of Housing and Urban Developments inspector general and examined Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Citigroup and Ally Financial, the sources said.

 The audits accuse the five major lenders of violating the False Claims Act, a Civil War-era law crafted as a weapon against firms that swindle the government. The audits were completed between February and March, the sources said. The internal watchdog office at HUD referred its findings to the Department of Justice, which must now decide whether to file charges.

https://www.sec.gov/news/press/2010/2010-59.htm

 The SEC alleges that Goldman Sachs structured and marketed a synthetic collateralized debt obligation (CDO) that hinged on the performance of subprime residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS). Goldman Sachs failed to disclose to investors vital information about the CDO, in particular the role that a major hedge fund played in the portfolio selection process and the fact that the hedge fund had taken a short position against the CDO.

[He did](http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/eric-holder-wall-street-double-agent-comes-in-from-the-cold-20150708 ).

  If you don't want to hire people from a firm that could be called a "Wall Street defense firm"

There are lots of top firms that wouldn't be considered top Wall Street defense firms - WSGR, Fenwick, Orrick, etc.  They do financing with these companies, but they certainly are not packed with lawyers who defend them from prosecution.

 I think some oversight is required

 I agree, I just think it occurred.

I don't see how you can look at the evidence in that Frontline piece and come out with the opinion you have.  Honestly, you've only convinced me that you're part of the problem.

And yes, we got Bill Clinton, who is now apologizing for saddling us with NAFTA, giving us Wall Street deregulation, disastrous drug policies, trade policies that drove up drug prices, and giving us mass incarceration which has made us the world's top jailor.

Sounds like your mind is made up, but if you want to learn something, checkout Frontline's coverage of this topic:
http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/untouchables/

[This blog](http://firedoglake.com/2013/01/23/frontline-exposes-dojs-failure-to-prosecute-wall-street/ ) has a good write up that talks about how Frontline reporters were easily able to find witnesses to the crimes that Holder's attorney Lanny Breuer claimed did not exist.  Breuer is the guy who articulated the DOJ's [Too Big to Prosecute Policy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gbcB5BRzXo feature=youtu.be t=19m30s ):

 We are frequently on the receiving end of presentations from defense counsel, CEOs and economists who argue that the collateral consequences of an indictment would be devastating, just devasting for their client.  In my conference room over these past years, I've heard sober predictions that a company or bank might fail if we indict.  That innocent employees could lose their jobs.  That entire industries could be affected and that even global markets will feel the effects.  ... In reaching every chargin decisions we must take into account the effect of an indictment on innocent employees and shareholders..."

If you don't think there's something wrong with that,  sorry, but you are part of the problem.

	<TEXT>  The revolving door is a reality. It's really, really hard to change that.

That's an absurd, defeatist position.  That's like saying "the floor gets dirty, so why clean it?"  

The fact is, that things have gotten *much worse* over the past 40 years.  http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/28/books/review/this-town-by-mark-leibovich.html:

 in 1974, 3 percent of retiring members of Congress became lobbyists. Now 50 percent of senators and 42 percent of congressmen do. No one goes home anymore.


You make a good case for someone you want to have Holder's resume.  However, you're also ignoring the fact that this guy *did not prosecute people who were his former and future potential clients* while he was AG.  He did not prosecute them for what is agreed to be some of the greatest financial frauds the country has ever seen .  And this went on *for years* with Obama doing nothing about it.  When you have someone with an obvious conflict of interest --- like Holder with his empty corner office at one of Wall Street's favorite defense firms --- I think some oversight is required, or do you disagree with this?  Do you disagree that such a nominee ought to be carefully selected so that they are not in fact a crony of the system they have need to oversee? </TEXT>

 Interviewer: "[Your supporters] are afraid that Clinton won't give voice to issues that you care about"

... Warren talks at length about student loan issues.

 Interviewer: "Is Hillary Clinton the right messenger? Could she give a credible voice to give the middle class a fair shake?"

 I think we need to give her a chance to decide if shes going to run and to lay out what she wants to run on, Warren said. **I think thats her opportunity to do that.**

 Warren: "Everyone needs to be talking about, in every race and in every county how we need to be creating a future for the middle class."

That's hardly an endorsement.  She's signaling that Hillary needs to support progressive causes.  Warren is holding a stick to get Hillary to move the debate to the left.  That's smart politics.  

If she just got out and declared against Hillary, she'd just be cast as an opponent and the story would be "Democrats fighting with each other again".  Staying on the sidelines means candidates need to court her.  She shapes the whole conversation.  She can endorse at a later time (the pressure will build for her to do so).  If she times that endorsement correctly, she'll be able to push her preferred nominee to victory.  If she endorses Sanders for example too early, she loses the power of her independent voice.  Endorse now, and everything she says from now on will be considered just another mouthpiece of the Sanders campaign.  As it is, she keeps people guessing, and provides an independent force that drives the conversation to the left. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Or 15% of the voting public have dropped out of the process because they just don't give a shit about politics.

They don't give a shit because they know what political scientists have proven: [the US is an oligarchy](http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-echochambers-27074746 ).   Voting for a candidate funded by Wall Street gives you a candidate who serves the interests of Wall Street.  

 Because those of us who really need our politicians to guard the line effectively know that politics is too important to fuck around with fantasyland.

That is exactly the thinking that those who fund both parties are counting on.  The fantasy is that a corporate candidate is going to do something other than serve those corporate interests.  

http://www.politico.com/story/2014/04/wall-street-republicans-hillary-clinton-2016-106070.html:

 The darkest secret in the big money world of the Republican coastal elite is that **the most palatable alternative to a nominee such as Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas or Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky would be Clinton**, a familiar face on Wall Street following her tenure as a New York senator with relatively moderate views on taxation and financial regulation.

 **If it turns out to be Jeb versus Hillary we would love that and either outcome would be fine,** one top Republican-leaning Wall Street lawyer said over lunch in midtown Manhattan last week. We could live with either one. Jeb versus Joe Biden would also be fine. Its Rand Paul or Ted Cruz versus someone like Elizabeth Warren that would be everybodys worst nightmare. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Enthusiasm is an impossible thing to measure beyond anecdotal evidence

Disagree.   Social media metrics - likes, shares, followers - are well recognized measures of enthusiasm.  My company works with Fortune 500 brands, and I can tell you they are *all* concerned with these metrics.  They would drool to have a tiny sliver of what Sanders gets for free.  I've looked at the numbers, and he's killing on this front. 

 Ultimately, however, the amount of votes that will be reached and turned by that base is just not big enough to warrant a discussion in a primary like this

You seem certain, but supply no evidence to support that claim.  How would you quantitate that?  How big is that audience?  Why did Sanders rise from 2% to 15% in a couple of months, and with no funding?   Did your thinking account for that?  Why should I think that your current feelings have any more predictive power?

 Social Advertising may happen, but that risks over-enthusiasm (See many in Tea Party) and a resultant content exhaustion from other consumers.

This is just opinion masquerading as fact. One could easily say "advertising on traditional media risks over exhaustion and mistrust of consumers, who increasingly see paid media as untrustworthy.  Hillary's billions may backfire on her".  See?  Anyone can spout opinions.

	<TEXT>  but the issue is that most of these people aren't going to have the experience or training at the level of the Field Organizers that Hillary will have, which is where her fundamental advantages lies. 

Agree - I think that's a big challenge for his campaign.  I just came across this  New Republic article asking the same question.  Someone  who's involved with the campaign says that there's a big launch planned for end of July.  It will be interesting to see how they manage:
https://np.reddit.com/r/SandersForPresident/comments/3d9iqo/bernie_sanderss_grassroots_army_is_passionate_but/ct341xe

 There's already over a thousand events across the country scheduled, with more added daily. These volunteer coordinators will CC the regional coordinators on things. In a way, there is a top-down oversight they're working on, but it still depends heavily on volunteers. 

Sounds like lots of stuff happening, but "in a way/depends heavily on volunteers" suggests there's not much coordination (yet). </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Crowds don't really mean anything in a Presidential election.

Crowds are an indicator of enthusiasm, and you later say that enthusiasm is important, so you seem to be contradicting yourself.

 People who go to a rally aren't going to do anything but vote for the candidate, 

For starters, they talk about the candidate on social media.  Social media is free and as advertising it's more effective.  To quantitate this, consider that even *paid* influencer advertising is estimated to be [4-10x more likely to cause a conversion than traditional media](http://branderati.com/the-age-of-advocacy-and-influence-26-stats-marketers-should-know/ ).  Sanders is winning social media hands down over *every* other candidate.  See [this piece in NYT](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/19/us/politics/bernie-sanders-wants-to-be-president-but-hes-already-facebook-royalty.html ).  

So Sanders is the hands down winner at the most effective form of advertising which also happens to be completely free.  


 Hillary's phone-banking, GOTV, and door-knocking will be an organized and efficient machine that Sanders cannot hope to touch, realistically.

Being able to pay workers is helpful. But what do you make of the 175K (as of May 4th) Sanders volunteers?  Obviously, not all will activate, but it goes to the point that enthusiasm means Sanders can do much more with much less.

It's not clear that Sanders won't be organized --- he's getting top talent joining his campaign.  Organizers like the head of the Communication Workers Union just recently joined for example.  But agree, he doesn't have the well oiled machine that Clinton has and her advantages in the mainstream media are matched by his deficits there.  Ad to this that Clinton and her supporters in key positions in the Democratic Party (e.g., Wasserman Schultz) are doing their best to tip the scales in her favor, and we can see that Sanders has his work cut out for him.

Still, it's far from a certainty where it will go.  The new media landscape and massive voter frustration are new variables. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Bernie Sanders most definitely knows that he will not

Is there any useful information in that statement?

Prediction markets currently give him 11%.

  The country is split basically 50/50 politically and the battle is for the increasingly small middle. 

"The battle for the middle"  is a Sunday talk show trope, which like many things they say, is not backed by actual evidence.  Elections are more likely won or lost based on the enthusiasm gap.  Here's [an analysis from Nate Silver](http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/11/04/enthusiasm-gap-was-largest-in-presidential-swing-states/ ) which pretty convincingly demonstrates this.

I.e., Battle for the Middle is nonsense.  Voter enthusiasm is key.  

(Who has been drawing the largest crowds of any Presidential candidate?)

  If you are the kind of person who would vote for Bernie Sanders, you are not the kind of person who is going to vote for Bush, Paul, or Rubio. 

Not clear - Bernie  appeals to voters who are frustrated by bad government.  Republicans win low information voters with a populist message about big government elitists.  Corporate Democrats play right into that messaging.

Sanders' thesis is that there are a lot of people frustrated with government who would be open to a populist message from the left.  That hasn't happened in over 50 years, but the last time it did, Democrats won huge majorities and were competitive in all 50 states.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What are you basing that on?  

General election voter participation rate has been trending downwards since the 80s.  In 88 it was above 75%, now it is just breaking 60%.  At the same time we have the Congressional approval rating in history.  

So 15% of the voting public have dropped out of the process because they don't believe their elected officials actually represent them (an idea [verified] (http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-echochambers-27074746 )  by political scientists).

That's a huge number of new voters that  might be reached by the right campaign.

	<TEXT> So given that they don't have a criminal record and that they may just be angry impulsive people *in general*, is there actually any way to keep the guns out of their hands?

I.e., with criminals you can mandate criminal background checks.  If it were people with diagnosable mental disorders, it might be possible to regulate based on mental health history (though, obviously, lots of issues in how to handle that).  If it were people who got angry suddenly and committed acts soon thereafter, you could have a waiting period.  

BUT... if it's a population of people who are constantly angry and impulsive, neither criminal background check nor psychiatric check nor waiting period is going to fix the problem.

	<TEXT> Agree - he seems to be also have the regular Republican voter in mind.  He has talked about the [50 state strategy](http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/sanders-dems-insane-to-ignore-red-states-wants-primary-debates-with-republicans/article/2567646 ) (that Howard Dean initially championed).  I think he has the message to do it.

	<TEXT> I keep seeing anecdotes - here on Reddit, and in the news (see below) - that otherwise stalwart Republican voters like what they hear from Bernie.  Ideologues are still going to hate him... but it may be that a lot of casual conservatives care more about authenticity.  Bernie gives an unfiltered explanation of why America isn't working for them and a clear plan to change that. 

So is there a population of Republicans who'd switch if they heard Bernie's message?  I'd love to see numbers on this.

Team Sanders seems to understand this already, given the recent ad.

	<TEXT> I keep seeing anecdotes like this.  I'd love to see some numbers on this.

The reason Democrats lost so many people in the middle of the country is that we've run inauthentic Washington liberals. To the extent that Obama has tacked right and failed to be a progressive, his numbers have fallen.  Washington insiders argue that the country is center right, but I think the opposite is true --- on issue after issue, Americans are much further left than our actual politics.  The problem is that neither party gives them what they want.  Democrats give a watered down version that people don't know whether to trust.  While Republicans mislead them with lies that explain why they are held back economically (Big Government! Washington Liberals!)

Regular folks want straight talkers who don't hold back, and who give them explanations of why America isn't working for them, not carefully parsed talking points.  GWB gave them a manufactured authenticity.  Sanders, on the other hand, is genuinely authentic, and I think the public is hungry for it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Mismanagement is mismanagement.  It doesn't matter how you get there.

Bible Belt doesn't have its own currency, so the only way it can survive is by a massive injection of Federal dollars.

Greece can't debase its currency (making its exports cheaper) AND it isn't getting funds from the wealthier parts of the currency union.

Either you have a currency union and there are cash transfers to keep the failures afloat (like here in the US), or you have separate states with separate currencies.   </TEXT>
