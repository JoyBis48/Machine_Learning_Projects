	<TEXT> I finished **The Martian, by Andy Weir** which I thought was really good, but some aspects dragged on throughout the book. (The fact that is was originally a serial is apparent)

I just started the first of the Mistborn series **The Final Empire, by Brandon Sanderson**, since I'd seen it recommended so much on Reddit, and this is shaping up to being one compelling read. The only off putting thing was trying to get started as it throws the reader into the thick of it without defining some of the terms such as "skaa". </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The reason I am asking is that my mother is an elementary media specialist and I was curious as to what you all thought about libraries doing that.

This also raised some question as to where certain books go as there was some question as to whether or not to split SciFi and Fantasy since SciFi is, for the most part, futuristic fantasy.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Quoting from a MyAnimeList thread about it:

 By order of release date:

Tenchi Muyo! Ryo-Ohki

Tenchi Muyo! Mihoshi Special

Tenchi Universe

Tenchi in Tokyo

Tenchi Muyo! GXP

The first two are ova's (Original video animation) if you want you could just start at Tenchi Universe and you'll be fine.

As for where to watch it, I think Funimation has the license to the series but I don't know if they have it on their website. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It is a mess. It was good for about wo years and then the leadership changed. They took what used to be a fun club where people would poke fun at the characters and situations to a club where you cannot talk or do anything fun.

I found that the university has more people who watch anime than go to the club and they are more fun to hang out with. 

Similar to the experiences shared within, the club seems to be getting creepier and creepier each year. (Thankfully it hasn't gotten to the stage of people bringing in dakimakuras and what not) </TEXT>

To summarize, by doing do I'm able to:

* I tend to hit the ball more than with the angle at -5 while in ball cam

	<TITLE> [Suggestion] Change your camera angle if you are going to, mainly, use ball mode. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-07-13 00:17:04 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I was playing earlier today and I decided to fiddle with the camera settings to see if I could improve the view while playing in ball mode. 

I found, so far, that leaving everything default but changing the angle from -5 to -10 vastly improved my play and it was easier to line up shots. What this does is make it so that the camera, even on kickoff with the ball all the way up in the air, shows the back of the car which give you the position and orientation of the car compared to the ball. While it, slightly, limits the view on the normal camera mode it isn't drastic enough to change back to the old setting.


For some anecdotal evidence,  I took this online in 3v3s, and we were able to go 8-0 with myself getting 4 goals. I do not consider myself to be that good of a player, but I have noticed an improvement. Whether this is consistent is left to further testing. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It takes time and money to make games, or anything for that matter. Most of the free games, whether or not they are on Steam, are passion projects and something the developer did in their spare time. (a la Cave Story or [Narcissu](http://store.steampowered.com/app/264380/)) Some free games are made to purposefully grow a community such as Trackmania: Nations. (It used to be completely F2P, but an update limited the time that people could play for free before having to sit out a round.) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was asking because when I am away at college, my PS4 is hooked up to a small TV as my dorm room doesn't have that much space, but in order to see it I'd have to be 8-10 feet away from the screen. Due to that, I barely touch my PS4 during the school year.

I was, basically, wondering whether or not people felt as though it was worthwhile for me to get it on the PC as well due to that fact. (If I'm on my laptop, I am a lot closer to the screen.) </TEXT>

In HW, you have to complete the main story quest all the way through the 2.55 update of content. It will take you anywhere from 70-150 hours to complete this content. [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/3bheg1/guide_to_catching_up_to_patch_30_heavensward/) is a good, spoiler free, guide as to what you have and can do to catch up to where heavensward begins.

Do not worry about your friends being at the endgame level right now as you'd catch up soon enough. That and they'd still get a good amount of exp from helping you progress through the required dungeons and what not. </TEXT>

/u/smokeshack typed the hiragana wrong as you have to hit "n" twice to write "" which is "n" in Japanese. The reason for this is that there are characters with "a,i,u,e,o" after an "n". ( ,  ,  , , respectively) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, it does seem a bit off. I think the fact that the episode is broken out into skits rather than being combined together in a more seamless manner is causing it. It stems from the source as Working is a 4-koma manga rather than a continuous format. This means that the situations and characters are expressed within something akin to a comic strip which creates a natural pause for the reader.

I believe that the original director had a better grasp on how to alleviate the skit-esque feeling when adapting the previous two seasons of Working. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> How about this? Scrap WM, and make it so that BRD players can choose whether or not to cast it. 

Have it so a tap, or click, of the skill does the normal skill but holding the skill causes it to cast with a 25% damage bonus. This would create more of a skill based system and it would allow the freedom and flexibility without being clunky.

(This has a basis in reality as archers could either fire fast for effect or line up their shot, thereby taking longer, for increased damage)  </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2015-06-24 03:26:45 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> **NOTE:** US only! Also, residents of AR, CO, ME, MO, RI and VT are ineligible to receive Amazon Prime referral credit.

Amazon, currently, have two different sets of referring going on. The first is for **Amazon Student**, which is Prime geared towards college students. 

---

**What is Amazon Student?**

It is basically Amazon Prime, but for college students. Also, rather than costing $99 a year, it is $49 and has all of the benefits. You can get a six month free trial without the streaming video, music and the kindle lending library.

**What do I need to be able to sign up for Amazon student?**

You need a .edu email address and you must give your school (college/university) along with your year and intended date of graduation (Month/Year). 


**What if I am not a student?**

This is the second program for **regular people** where if people use your link to sign up, you earn a $5 credit for each person. This would be great to share with an audience that could benefit from having Amazon Prime. They can get a 30-day trial for free.

**What are the benefits of Amazon Prime?**

* Free 2 day shipping on **any** Amazon fulfilled order.
* Free release date shipping on video games and others. (*Only through Amazon Student*)
* Instant streaming of movies and TV shows. (Only available when you pay for it. Not on the trial.)
* Streaming music through Amazon Music.
* You can borrow one book a month for the Kindle.
* Unlimited photo storage on Amazon Cloud Services (Photography businesses cannot use this)

**How is this related to /r/digitalmarketing?**
---
Right now, each person you refer nets you credit on Amazon that is similar to a gift card. (Sadly, you can only use it on items directly sold by Amazon rather than through a third party seller.)


How much do I earn per referral?
---
Audience | Referral Amount
---|---
College Students | $10 per person
Regular People | $5 per person

Links:
---
Audience | Ref Link | Regular Link |
---|---|---
College Students | [REF](http://www.amazon.com/gp/student/signup/info?ie=UTF8 amp;refcust=UYST2WEHN53UCPBOKHWXH2ZGFU amp;ref_type=generic) | [Non-Ref](https://www.amazon.com/gp/student/signup/info)
Regular People | [REF](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00DBYBNEE?_encoding=UTF8 amp;ref=prime_mrp_fbook amp;refcust=RTHJIVCVTXDG4RQWFIJGFXNV7A amp;fb_ref=Default) | [Non-Ref](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DBYBNEE/ref=nav_prime_try_btn)


---

**Why am I sharing this here?** 

In part to help myself, but also to give another avenue for those who have access to either a college aged audience or an audience that would be receptive to such a thing. (Think forums for parents, or other places in which people would be susceptible to sign up for Amazon Prime.)

	<TEXT> Japanese has katakana which is, mainly, used to denote foreign words and provide a phonetic basis to the words. For example, cake in Japanese is  (Ke i ki) and another example is America in Japanese is  (A me ri ka). They do not have a "C" so "K"'is used instead. I believe that some, or most, of the names of items and such are written in katakana and then phonetically translated into English.

EDIT: Fixed the katakana for cake. Thanks /u/zhv. </TEXT>
