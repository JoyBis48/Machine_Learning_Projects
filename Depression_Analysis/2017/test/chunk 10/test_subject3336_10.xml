	<TEXT> More transition effects in the app drawer or homescreen switches.  
More app based integration like aviate.  
my color screen like themes.  
^ all of this added/removed by the users wishes(so he/she can keep it light or as feature rich as possible).  

Im not Saying Nova devs should'nt be rewards for their work. They have every right to put a price on their app after all the hard-work that goes into it.  

But the possibility of the what nova can do can be really expanded once you have a user/dev/contributor system in place.  

Also people will pay for stuff if they feel that it improves the overall experience on android.  If an opportunity arrives that they can invest on it/choose the set best set of features for the next version; many will definitely contribute to the development.

If we have an open system, people have access to all of this and if they really like it you could donate to fund development.

	<TEXT> i've personally noticed that lot of people want to customize but don't really do anything because they look up their favorite launcher has a limited custom set of awesome features; and also for lots of android user - the cost is a big hindrance($ - local currency conversion)  

So most of them settle for the UI that comes with the phone or install a free version of the launcher with limited set of feature.  

When you have an open environment, users/devs could write an unlimited amount tiny plugins that people can download for features they'd like to have in a launcher.   
The app can also accept donations from users so that good development happens.  

I really like Nova and i hope they continue to be the game changer! :)

Don't give up on the b2gdroid platform.  
it has a HUGE HUGE potential im totally unaware of but i know it exists.  
Yes, its not bug-free but please continue to develop and erase all the issues.   
I was instally in awe of the UI on b2gdroid; and its very very good on usability and friendliness.   
Keep developing!  

Once its ready launch it on the playstore as an homescreen alternative and take-off from there!  

One Major issue- battery drain. Please fix that. And if rolling nightly releases are available things will be much better for tester's.   </TEXT>

Buy according to fedora you'll have a good, bad and ugly set of gstreamer packages.( Maybe a separate ffmpeg package too).  
Maybe debian has them inbuilt.

	<TEXT> Hey there!  

Check on these lines in about:config to be set to "true":   
media.mediasource.enabled  
media.mediasource.format-reader.mp4  
media.mediasource.mp4.enabled  
media.format-reader.mp4  
media.fragmented-mp4.enabled  
media.fragmented-mp4.exposed  

Some of the option listed above might not be there in your Firefox so its okay to skip them.  
And a suggestion let webM be disabled. You'll run into a lot of choppy performance issues on YouTube and ruin the experience.  
Also dont think ignore_codecs is necessary. Try without it as well.  

If h264 is still being unrecognized its mostly the codec not being present on the system.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> what i mentioned here is for personal usage.(i don't want to blamed for some problems on a larger scale later on - hope you understand; and everything can be fixed with a reset/refresh)  
Since these things will become enabled in the proper way once things hit release.  
But if you insist use this addon for mass setup - https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cck2wizard/  

Not sure how it works but perhaps the right one for the job.
