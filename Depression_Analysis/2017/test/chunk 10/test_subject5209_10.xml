	<TITLE> Is it out of line to want to know where your SO is going when they leave the house? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> To keep it short, my wife (35F) and I (33M) just got done with a talk about where our failing marriage is headed and if it's something that we want to fight for (I know I want us to work out, but her answer to every question I ask is, "I don't know").

She just left the house without telling me where she was going. I texted her and she replied, "Wow! Last time I checked I was a grown adult!". Is it wrong of me to want to know...just in case something happens to her? I still care and worry about her.

**tl;dr** I'd like to know where she's going at 11:30 at night. </TEXT>

Parents said I could stay as long as I wanted to after high school and college, rent free. Ended up saving up a LOT of money doing that. I was able to pay off multiple cars over the years, built my credit up to a great number, and had a hefty savings for doing special things with my girl (including buying her the rings and wedding that she always wanted).
