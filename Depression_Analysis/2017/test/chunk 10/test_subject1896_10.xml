	<TEXT> Special tip that I didn't include in this: I did find out from someone that FYI was not a part of my hiring process that the reason I got an interview was largely due to my selection of "open availability" that I marked on my online app. It wasn't true necessarily (I was in school). It's how I got the interview email so quickly I think. </TEXT>

From another thread:

I turned in this thesis for my creative writing degree in May. More of a Capstone. I had to submit 80 pages of my best work that I'd created during my time at Chapman, which could include new work. This was orignally like 4,000 words of scatterbrain thoughts about working at Disneyland which I ended up inflating to a full-on submission. Didn't have to present it, but the committee read it and sent it back to me with some awesome feedback. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Put contact info in your bio (your email, and email that you create, don't matter it's up to you). I bet you'll be approached to sell that, especially if you make it easy with the contact info. I'm not sure for other countries, but as you probably know it's common practice to get paid for good usernames, even tho it's against the TOS. It happens though, and if your name is the name of the show, then I'd hold tight. Maybe try opening a different account for your personal stuff, now. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is a movie I saw with my grandma about 2009-2010 I think, give or take a year or two past. We would really like the information of the doctor in the movie. 

The mother of the boy wrote to the doctor because someone told her his job is to look for cures for illnesses without one. He replied "if you're willing to move here to Oregon with your son, we will try to find a cure." 

He was successful in finding a cure, and at the end it shows the name and address of the doctor in Portland OR. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I never write for SEO. To begin, start getting to know the social medias better. Explore the different features and pay attention to what kinds of things show up in your feed (type of post, from who, when). Then read up on social media talk from social media marketing blogs. Then (fast forward) start by looking for jobs in "content creation" or "content writing". </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I do. I write mainly comedic narratives, but also accrued a sizeable following on social media on Twitter and FB. I get paid kind of often for stories in a handful of publications.

However, I don't make any considerable amount of my income from the kinds of writing I enjoy most (including the stuff included above). Instead, I get paid as a writer for companies to do their social media.

It's more than that, because I also consult on soc media marketing strategy and lead campaigns for these companies. But I began as a writer, and any one of you can do it too. It's fulfilling to an extent because it pays me well and lets me write creatively. It flexes my muscles in writing engaging content and in different voices.

I began in college, and could do it because I already had a knack of writing on social media. Majored in creative writing and minored in public relations/advertising, so when I decided to find a job I just put what I could do with social media on my resume. Only one agency hit me back and took a chance on me. Great for both of us. </TEXT>
