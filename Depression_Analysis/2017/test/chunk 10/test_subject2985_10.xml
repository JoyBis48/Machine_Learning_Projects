	<TEXT> Only played two (extremely laggy) games with him, but my initial impression is that he's a total fucking monster. His W is hard to land (might have just been the lag) and maintain, but it deals and heals massive damage, and his Q really wrecks. The E is a decent, though not amazing, escape and chasing tool.

As great as his Q and W are, it's Entomb that's his best ability. It probably needs to be on a smaller cooldown, because it's insanely good. The other Ult is kind of awkward, though it seems okay (especially with the level 20 buff), but it can't touch Entomb.

It's also fantastic never being truly dead. I normally hate death traits (I main Tyrael), but I have to credit the designers for this one. It's awesome not only having something to do while being dead, but also having no travel time once you're back up.

Leoric is super fun, a total powerhouse, and I really like him. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Are you maybe thinking of Donald Trump? He paid people $50 a piece to attend his announcement speech.

Bernie doesn't have any significant personal wealth, he's running a very lean campaign, and he refuses to use a SuperPAC. He is definitely not buying crowds. In fact, his platform is centered around stopping people from buying elections.

Check out this interview, if you still think it's possible that he'd pay for crowd attendance:

	<TEXT> I wonder if we could get one of the networks to do a story about this.

Even NPR is largely ignoring him. He gets an off-handed comment every now and then, usually prompted by a caller's question *about* him, but that's about it, and they usually change the topic very quickly. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Personally, I think he'd dominate in the general. With as many republicans as I see on a daily basis crossing over the isle, and with the way that he's energizing the left (who don't always show up at the polls), I think he'd be pretty unbeatable.

Conversely, I think Hillary is pretty divisive. People either love her or hate her. That said, I think if Bernie can't beat her, nobody can.

So really, I think this election is really all about the democratic primary. In my opinion, whichever one of these two wins the nomination will win The White House. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I, and at least one of my friends, will be walking the 5k, if that helps. Most of the day after will just be relaxing at the resort, too, though there will be swimming and other activities (frisbee, volleyball maybe) as well. These things are typically pretty fun, but there's also a lot of laying around and relaxing, too.

No pressure, though. If you can make it great. If not they might do another next year. </TEXT>
