There was another part where one of the journalists laid down to take a picture of a statue or Kim Il Song, and a party member chaperone blew up, threatening to have them kicked out of the county that day for disrespecting the statue. Fucking crazy. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hieeeee Ru! I just wanted to say that you are such a huge inspiration and I've been a die hard fan of Drag Race since season 2 when I stumbled upon it. I love all of your ideology and you've helped me learn to really love myself. I really feel it and I know I can do anything I set my mind to. I sometimes get down because I haven't found that one person I can really connect with and to give some of this love to. I'm young and I got time but I can't help feel like something is missing although I have all the pieces in front of me. How do I go about becoming more positive on my outlook towards a prospective partner or finding someone to share myself with? Don't get me wrong, I love my friends and family. What I crave is intimate connection. How do I get what I've desired for so long? Thanks for listening! Can't wait for the new season! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My parents have a Dauschund that whines and cries during car rides. Our other Dauschund loves car rides and she does too. It's just when we do long car rides over 45 minutes long that she gets anxiety. She's about 6 years old. I've been thinking maybe getting her an anxiety shirt (a thunder shirt I think is what it's called) and see if that would help her. Holding her in your lap sometimes isn't enough and she'll start whining again. I hope the comstant press use and sensation of being held will help her. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey everyone. I'm fairly new to playing the video games. I only ever watched the tv show and did the card game when I was younger. So I need advice on how to beat the elite four and the champ in this particular game. Here's the pokemon I currently have on me:

Cobalion lvl 67
Terrakion lvl 54
Magneton lvl 53
Unfezant lvl 51
Golduck lvl 48
Surperior lvl 44

Any advice helps. If I need to go and level up my pokemon more, then I'll do it. If you can give me a strategy so I don't have to do that, even better. Anything helps! Thanks! </TEXT>

The pores get clogged very quickly as well. I wash my face every day using just a basic Dove men's face and body wash. My face feels good for about 4 hours, and then it feels like I heavily dowsed my face in oil. I need some help! Anything helps! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Even if you could get decent prints off the blades, they would still have to be run off databases. It could've been done by someone who's never had their prints taken, like dumb teenagers. The Intergrated Automated Fringerprint Identification System [(IAFIS)](http://m.fbi.gov/#http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/fingerprints_biometrics/iafis/iafis)  has millions of fingerprints in its database which includes criminals, civilians, and suspected/known terrorists. Even if the comparison was narrowed down to the local level, they have a large possibility of not getting caught. But do I hope these sick fucks get what's coming to them? Absolutely. </TEXT>

I think it was the next day or so, I took a risk and asked him to dinner (which was super uncomfortable for me since I had never actually asked someone out due to the lack of opportunity). It never happened. Not because he said no, but because after I asked him out he stopped talking to me. We were having a great time talking to each other, but I guess he couldn't handle talking to someone face to face. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I remember this place as well. I used to talk to a lot of people and it made me feel better. I had a guy that I really liked and he liked me as well and so it was an internet relationship of sorts. Then his mom found out about him and one day I get a call from his phone number, but it was his mom and she accused me of poisoning her son and never to contact him again or she'll call the police. I was 15 at the time and just the threat of police scared me so much. I felt bad for him and also myself because it was the first guy I actually had a connection with. I often wonder how he's doing and if he ever ended up ok. There were other significant people I met but that one has always stayed with me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey Alex! I'm a big fan of yours and I'm so glad to see you doing this AMA. I used to watch MadTV ALL THE TIME when you were on it, no matter what character it was. I just wanted to know if there was anything that you miss about the show and do you still keep in touch with your former cast mates? Do you still do live sketch comedy at all? Thank you for making me and my family laugh all these years! </TEXT>

	<TITLE> I told my dad that I needed help and I couldn't feel any worse </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Bear with me, I swear it's all relevant.

I'm a 20 year old gay man who is currently living at home, with a very non existent social life. I've never been in a serious committed relationship where I called him my boyfriend. It's always been strictly physical and I just always went along with it, anything to hopefully have a relationship. I know how that sounds and it took me a whole to realize how ridiculous it is. A guy I was seeing last year (let's call him Bill) ended things after 8 months. During the entire time I thought I was going to get committment from him but it ended on heartbreak. I blame myself for anything I did to make him not want me.

Fast forward and we're good friends. I forgave him, and after a nice break from him I got over my feelings for him. He started seeing this girl and I was fine with everything. He said he wasn't into going full on with a guy. This past Sunday he says things didn't work with this girl. It was too bad because he liked this girl. Later on he shows me a letter and says it's to his "boyfriend." My heart actually sunk and I snapped. I went off. He said they'd been seeing each other for two months and then he asked him to be his boyfriend. I was shocked. Literally. He's free to do what he wants, it's just the only that bothered me was that he was so quick to commit to this guy he met two months ago. I spent 8 whole months working on him, trying to get him to commit, and it takes this guy two months.

I went off. I cried in anger, I was sobbing uncontrollably for four hours. What did this new guy do that I didn't? Is it me? After Bill, I searched for someone to make me feel whole, loved and like I wasn't hopeless. I had met this guys in September who I though was going to be the guy to commit and after two months he just stopped talking to me.

I think I have depression and I might be bipolar (all of which hasn't been diagnosed because of how afraid I am to see someone). I've never felt lower. I just get rejected and then Bill commits making me plunge. I almost did something drastic to myself. Despite all the desire to end it, I stomached my pain and reached out to my dad. I didn't tell him about being gay, but I told him I needed help. But he tells me that maybe I should "pray more" because "God will fix it" and that I need to "rid [myself] of the Devil."

I finally got the courage to reach out, and it feels like it was made into a joke. I don't consider myself religious. I'm spiritual but I don't believe in God (if that makes sense). I prayed to him since I was 12 to make the desires for other boys go away, and since I was 15 to make my suicidal thoughts go away and to make me not so sad all the time. People say he works in mysterious ways, but making me and others like me suffer so much is plain cruel. 

Despite my dad being an ass, after the holidays, I'm going to make an appointment with my doctor and take the steps nescessary to beat these feelings. Telling him gave me the strength. I just needed somewhere to say all this. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I never said my theory was right, that's exactly why I said theory. It's my opinion and what I would think would happen in a practical situation. So excuse me Mr. Expert. But dogs CAN deliver false positives in ANY situation. Just because they're cadaver dogs doesn't make them extra special and excuse them from that probability.

I hate to break it to you, but you're also a dick. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They still can deliver a false positive. I theorize that the cadaver dog would not be able to detect any further smells after they expose the dead animal because his nose would be overwhelmed. The police would probably dig, find the dog, conclude the cadaver dog gave them a false positive and move on. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I hope you two continue being best friends. I told my best friend during the summer after junior year and he said he still was my best friend and he'll always love me like a brother. I haven't heard from him since 2012. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I only met her one time though. I'm confident I won't ever feel sad about her. I feel bad for the ones she left behind, but not her. From what I remember she was a very unsavory person, but now that I know she was depressed, I can see where that image I have if her comes from. I just thought she was a bitter, angry snob. It makes more sense now. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm confident my sadness or depression stems from me being gay and having to repress it all these years. I haven't told my parents because I know how strongly they feel about homosexuality and I don't want to lose my parents over it. I know that this sort of thing only happens in extremes cases but I would consider it that due to how my parents speak about it. Whenever they have to share their thoughts on how wrong and disgusting they think all gay people are, I do get some comfort from my brother who knows. I want to tell them about the depression and my sexuality but I don't want to be hurt from the very people who are supposed to love and support me unconditionally. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> My cousin committed suicide a few weeks ago </TITLE>

	<TEXT> She jumped off the Golden Gate Bridge. She was 41, I believe. I never knew her that well. I only met her once in my life back when I was in elementary school. My cousin had been diagnosed with depression some time ago and had been battling it intensely with therapy and medication. I was told by other family members closer to her that she even considered doing some form of voluntary electroshock therapy to cope with the feelings and make them go away. 

I myself have been struggling with sadness and horrible self-esteem issues. I myself have never been to a therapist because I'm too afraid of what my parents might think or say, or if they ask the reasons why I want professional help.

When you hear about someone's death, you're supposed to feel remorse, sorrow, sadness. Typically this is me too, but it was different this time because it struck a chord with me. It angered me. I became jealous of my cousin. She escaped her hell. I'm still in mine because I don't have the guts to off myself or get help. Does it make me a monster for not feeling sympathy? For being heartless? To be selfish in this way?  </TEXT>
