	<TEXT> I have sleep paralysis almost every night. Sometimes it includes a demon of sorts and sometimes it's just the paralysis. There's been times where it's a guy that's about as big as Arnold Schwarzenegger back in the eighties. He usually hides in the corner of the room dry humping a bed that only exists with him. He wears a hat like a drill sergeant. Other times it's an evil presence without any shadow or physical appearance. The evil presence is always accompanied by a feeling of something weighing me down like pressure on my chest. There's been times where it's a shadow that whispers my name. I end up asking my wife if it was her though really I know what it was.
When this happens I watch comedy on Netflix to clear my mind and get back to sleep. I discovered new (to me) comedians like John Pinette with this method.

I'm not sure if it's related to sleep paralysis, but I have dreams accompanied by sleep paralysis like symptoms at the end of a dream. Such dreams involve me living life as usual and suddenly I'm transported to a different place. This place is usually a desert and it's usually dark. I can only see about a five foot radius around myself and everything else is pitch black but not like night black but sharpie marker black. I just start floating around and of course I find it fun... at first. Then I float to this area that has like prison bars behind me. I can't control the floating anymore and it's creepy. I then hear a little kid's voice whispering and screaming all at once. The kid is whisper screaming "help me, please!" "Please help!" I turn around and behind the bars is a little kid, terrified. The kid's eyes are just eye sockets and blood drips down from the sockets. I scream a very high pitched scream that can be heard in the waking world. It's a scream I can not mimic while awake. Before my wife wakes me up, I'm paralysed the same as when I have a more standard sleep paralysis episode. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's not always someone who couldn't afford them from the start. Sometimes the parents could easily afford having kids and have no trouble doing so. It only takes one financial catastrophe to change the whole situation. I know people who financially had no issues supporting kids and had a financial crisis. Now they have welfare and food stamps. They aren't at fault for things out of their control. Not every family that is struggling to raise kids on poor income are at fault. Not to say that some people are just being irresponsible. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Just the other day, I was driving with some asshat behind me. The asshat was so close behind me, I think she was partially in my exhaust pipe.
I was gonna make a left turn onto the street my apartment was on. I got in the turn lane to turn. She then proceeds to do the same thing but she got in front of me. I thought she was gonna continue to the nearby light. No. She was turning onto the same street as I was.
I thought that she might be in a hurry, so I tried not to let it bother me. When she pulled into the parking lot of the apartments (she lives in the same community as I), I waited. She sat in her car for ten minutes. She wasn't in a hurry, she was just being an asshat. As soon as she was inside her apartment, I put a bunch of bologna and I poured my entire gallon of water on her car (it's cold enough out to freeze her car shut). When I went outside earlier, she was using an ice scraper to remove it all. Little round patches of missing paint and a very pissed off asshat.
Don't fucking cut me off.
It's probably the worst I've done to someone. </TEXT>
