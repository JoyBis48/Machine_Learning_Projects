	<TEXT> Like a social net to fall on once you hit the streets. I know life can be extremely difficult for felons outside of jail (US), from getting jobs to finding a place to live. I'd like to see the differences between Euro countries and the US in this because I'm guessing that has a lot to do with ire-offending rates. 

I also think a big problem is the cultural stigma attached to felons outside of prison. Someone does 4 years and gets out but never loses that tag that makes him different.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This was a great post until the last bit where you went completely over-the-top-smug.

I agree that prison is for rehabilitation but it is also a fucking punishment for the crime/s you've committed. While I 100% agree drugs should never land you in prison, and jay walking shouldn't throw you in jail; there need to be appropriate consequences for people's actions. This man raped, drugged and murdered at least one girl. He was a doctor who was in a position of extreme trust. He drugged other people so that he could rape in peace. He hid from society (at least French society) to avoid punishment.

All I'm saying is some people absolutely deserve the attention and humane treatment that fosters rehabilitation; some people deserve to sit in a jail for the rest of their lives and be reminded that being a member of society is something for people who don't rape and murder kids. 

Also correlation/causation all that.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When did I say that? We didn't have any players worth being franchise loyal to before Harden and Howard. Can you really blame the FO for not matching Parsons once Bosh was out of the equation? He'd would have been making more than harden. The Rockets would have had zero flexibility moving forward with a team that didn't make it out of the first round last season. 

I'll admit our roster has been a revolving door since Yao went down but franchise players don't just fall into your lap. Howard was obviously comfortable enough with the FO to take less over resigning with the Lakers.  /r/nba just has on shit colored spectacles when it comes to the rockets. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Like shit? How was Parsons treated like shit? How was Asik treated like shit? Besides the jersey thing, which could have easily just been a marketing team's really dumb error, how was Lin treated like shit?

Parsons - we would have given him 15 million per and gone over the salary cap had Bosh chose Houston

Asik - besides giving him a contract most people scoffed at (including r/nba), we tried to trade him until the trade deadline last season after acquiring Howard. What else do you want? Teams to not get a significantly better player at the position you already have a guy at?

Lin - gave him a team to run and be the focal point of. Just happened to pick up a much better player later that offseason. Their skill sets overlapped.

You people seem to think that this is a church peewee league or something.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's a fucking organization worth hundreds of millions of dollars. In what universe are you expecting them to "be nice". Yeah, they didn't roll out the red carpet like a superstar for the guy, but he was treated extremely well while he was here and conversely he treated us extremely well. Had we signed Bosh, he would have been rewarded directly by us with an instant match of his offer sheet (which would have cost owner Les Alexander a tremendous amount of luxury tax). As it turns out he was rewarded, just by a team up interstate 45. 

What more do you want them to do? Be nicer? Jesus, this isn't Sunday school.  </TEXT>

Give me a break guys, this is a cut throat business.

	<TEXT> Our comparable Dirk would have been Yao. Yao's career ended prematurely. Sorry we weren't nicer to him so he'd stay injury free. You have to have that special player first before you can't treat them well. And I guess to get to that discount we have to overpay for him first (by the way think it's a good contract for y'all as Dirk's widow is small - but a bad contract for us). So while I think y'all are overpaying for him, it makes sense, like it would have made sense for us to overpay him if we had signed Bosh.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah it's a pretty shitty forum. bsk4 must not have been going there for a long time. The whole contingent of 'player only fans' started with Yao when half of the posters were Chinese fans who only gave a shit about Yao and not the Rockets. Even before that though you had the old guard who would do nothing but compare the current squad to the championship era of Hakeem - dubbed 99ers (because they were original members when the board was founded in 99 - fun fact: i got banned from clutch fans about 5 years ago for telling Tinman (like The King of 99ers), to gobble on some dicks and stop talking the "good old days" so much). Honestly though, 'player/era only fans' aren't even the worst part. It's very knee-jerk, players (and coaches) get thrown under the bus constantly and are swiftly pulled out and kissed on the forehead when they play up to the expectations of entitled observers. Fickle, unintelligent posters abound, caution.

To be fair, there are a few posters there who are extremely solid and possess impressive basketball minds (DaDakota, Big Moe, HayesFan to name a few who stick out), unfortunately they get drowned out by what you're talking about. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Do you seriously think the Rockets would have beaten the Spurs

I never said that, but Dallas didn't beat the Spurs either.

The argument was that Dallas played good against the champs, so did the Rockets. The Rockets didn't have to play against the champs in the first round because they played better than the Mavs during the regular season. See how dumb all these arguments are? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm sure players measure historical precedent when they're deciding whether or not to join a team with the mission of winning a championship.

Pack it up everyone, the Mavs have reached the 2nd round more often than the Rockets over the last 15 years, clearly they're the superior horse to ride going forward.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> See, regardless of whether he ends up a Rocket next season or not is irrelevant. This is Morey 101, if he feels that Parson's is being overvalued by the market, he wipes his hands and wishes the player good luck. If the market dictates a price that Morey feels is not only within his valuation but also fits with his 'grand plan', he'll have a new contract waiting for Parsons before he gets on the plane.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Everyone's loyal until they aren't. I could see him giving a small discount (-10% max), but he's only been here 3 years, has no historical ties to the area, and he already helped us out big time in getting Howard (and just in general by being the best value in the NBA during his contract). Hope he gets whatever he deserves.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Really happy for Costa Rica. Spent one of the best years of my life living there during my senior year of high school (which incidentally was the last time y'all made it to the world cup - 2006). Unfortunately y'all didn't do as well then as you are doing now (think y'all went 0-3?).

Buena suerte Costa Rica!  </TEXT>
