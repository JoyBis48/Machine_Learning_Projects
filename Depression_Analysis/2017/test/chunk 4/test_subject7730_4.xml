	<TITLE> What Are Quality FREE VST's/Filters/Compressors/Samplers That You Know Of? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-07-13 17:02:39 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm looking for quality FREE Vst's. I make Hip-Hop music. Any VST/Filter/Compressor you feel a producer should have please leave in the comments below and a link to where we can get them would be great (not necessary)!

Edit: I use FL Studio.

Edit: Thank you to all who have posted! You guys help me find tons of new things to play with! Some more mastering tools would also be great, I forgot to mention that in the text   title when I wrote it! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not very hard at all to get into it. Check out busyworksbeats on youtube for things you really need help on. I was in a similar position to you when I was 14 and I started making beats on FL with no knowledge of chords or scales. All I really suggest is buying proper studio monitors. For hiphop production THAT IS ALL THE HARDWARE YOU NEED. Get some good VST's and demos and your set. I've been making beats for about a year and a half and [these](https://soundcloud.com/sonnywane/my-chain/s-unAqy) are the types of things I'm doing now. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks for the parody of my post, but Lefty was god-awful and I was commenting my hate for him the second episode he was brought back as a permanent host. I mean did you listen to him and his fake laughs and the pseudo-intellectual rants he would get lost on. Huge blemish of the show. </TEXT>
