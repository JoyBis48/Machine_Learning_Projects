	<TEXT> The one issue I had was that you're supposed to insert the pad completely in. I've always had an issue with that and never got it all the way in. In theory, what's supposed to happen is any liquid, the pad absorbs and expands, blocking you up completely. At some point your bod will force it out but I've never been comfortable with inserting it all the way. It's supposed to be one hell of a mind-fuck though as your body feels the need to expel, the pad blocks it and absorbs some. </TEXT>
