	<TEXT> If over time waves lose energy and speed, does that mean that there are separate sections for waves of separate wavelengths? I'm thinking this because if if an X-ray were to lose energy over time and become a radio wave,  wouldn't it be moving at the same rate as all other radio waves created near the same time? Then over time, wouldn't there be a huge difference in the number of radio waves and all other wavelengths? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't mean to be mean

but I'll make you my queen

if you suck on my peen

I keep it very clean

and it's really quite lean

I'm sorry it's green

I got a bad gene

but to counter the green, it has a nice sheen

I'll be honest, I'll become quite keen

if only you only

just suck on my peen
