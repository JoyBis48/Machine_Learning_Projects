	<TEXT> I recently bought a new 140mm fan for my PC to replace the old noisey one. The one i removed was one that simply connects to my PSU, the one i installed has a 4 pin pwm connector that i plugged into my motherboard.

Installation was simple enough, booted up my pc and the fan i had just install was spinning pretty slow. So i opened my PC up again, unplugged it, vacantly gawped at it and as im not a hardware kinda guy just plugged it back in assuming it was just some weird one off issue.

and BOOM the new fan started running much faster, was definately shifting some air about, however now a different fan, an old 120mm fan was now rotating much slower when before it would move some serious air just fine.

So what's the issue here because ive searched online and found nothing, is it a problem with my PSU?? </TEXT>
