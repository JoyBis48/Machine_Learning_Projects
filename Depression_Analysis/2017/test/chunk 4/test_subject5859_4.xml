	<TITLE> Very serious thought exercise. If every square meter of land currently referred to as the Gaza Strip, Israel, and the West Bank sank deep into the ocean, what would happen? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-08-04 21:26:38 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> 1.  Everyone has plenty of time to flee their area as it sinks very slowly, but the land's sinking is non-reversible.  Plenty of time to save movable objects, personal items, relics, certain masonry works, etc.



2.  Jordan, Egypt, Lebanon, and Syria's lands do not change beyond Jordan acquiring plenty of beach property.



3.  Though the land sinking is a far-fetched, absurd idea, the thought exercise of thinking about the land and the people is an important one.



4.  You can address any issue that comes to mind.  The people, the geo-political ramifications, the refugee statuses, reactions of other countries, the idea of a holy land, Zionism, conspiracy theories, etc, etc.



I ask this question seriously and look forward to you thoughtful answers.  Thank you. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would secure more international financial backing and a firmer distribution strategy before directing it myself the same way that Coppola directed Apocalypse Now and The Godfather.  The script is the book (and radio broadcast transcripts) with my notes in the margins.  CG would be sparse and hidden with purposeful in-camera tricks and props.  Casting would take several months with some favoritism toward lesser known performers of unusual backgrounds (puppeteers, acrobats, interesting speech impediments, etc)  The entire movie would be shot in the UK if possible, though some exteriors may need to be shot elsewhere.  I would hire a towel expert to find me the perfect towel prop.  Absorbent, trustworthy, and intergalactic.   I would film it the way I first envisioned it in my head as an older child.  With all the gloomy bright colors, characters played straight rather than silly, Arthur more as a square always trying to pretend he understands what is going on rather than just a (babel) fish out of water.  He has more depth than just a simple 'where am i?' arc.  I would shoot the film partially on Super 16 Color Reversal Kodak film and other settings of the film in other formats to get different saturations of the different atmospheres.  The UK portions would be filmed in a similar fashion t I, Claudius and the BBC's Hitchhiker miniseries.  I would deaden the contrasts between them a bit as to make it less of a gimmick.   Before shooting, I would bring my script (the book and radio transcripts with my notes) to various accomplished Adams lovers in academia and the acting/writing world and get their take on it.  Holding reading sessions on various scenes with famous improv actors to elicit new takes on the material.  It would be set in the late 70s as well.  Also, i would not take an enormous directorial/writing salary, though I would let my agent work on that.  There is enough material in that little book to make a hell of a funny/intriguing/enchanting/superweird/remarkable movie.  Just need to hire the right people to get my vision onto the screen through a rigorous, well-planned path I have planned.  (Also, may need a mud expert to get that bulldozer mud juuuuust right). </TEXT>

Just the absolute worst game that is currently in your collection (however which way you determine what 'worst' means for you).




For kicks, tell us why it's the worst and why you still own it.  Have fun!  :) </TEXT>

	<TITLE> If you could experience any single 5 minutes of history, which window of time would you choose? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-11-04 09:37:41 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Key element is you get **one vantage point**.  You're not physically there, but you sense all your surroundings.




For instance, you can be on the grassy knoll during the JFK assassination 2.5 minutes before he's shot ending 2.5 minutes after he's shot.  Basically your senses are there for a **360 degree vantage point experience**.




**You cannot alter history**.  You are intangible, ephemeral, ethereal, and imperceptible.  Think 'Being John Malkovich' but without having to be inside someone's head, and you don't end up on the New Jersey turnpike afterward.




You are just sensing the 5 minutes through sight, sound, smell, taste, temperature, etc from one single point.




The single point can move with a person, object, vehicle, comet, etc.  Your senses are 'harnessed' in relationship to one collection of mass.   For instance, you can be in JFK's motorcade in Dallas, a fixed point in front of Neil Armstrong's helmet that moves with him as he takes his first steps on the moon, or just beside an asteroid as it flies past a distant planet.  




**Thus, mention the specific place you'd be as well as the 5 minute gap.**




Have fun!  (Edited for clarification.) </TEXT>

	<TITLE> If the NFL added one team to every conference, which cities would be most likely and how would you organize the conferences? (Feel free to name the new franchises as well) </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-10-27 05:30:41 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So with Roger Goodell's comments about Los Angeles and London, it made me wonder which other cities might be added in the future.



The NFL could add four more teams and go to three divisions of six teams in each conference, but I love the idea of adding eight more teams to have eight divisions with five teams apiece.  Realistically, eight expansion teams would stretch the NFL quite thin, but it's fun to contemplate the circumstances and invent new teams.



Feel free to move the Jags to L.A., change Buffalo to Toronto, move teams around divisions, change the name of the Washington franchise, or anything else you want.  It's your hypothetical NFL.



If you're feeling extra ambitious, write out the divisions, locations, and team names like this and specify which are newly named, moved, and/or expanded teams...



**-AFC East-**

Buffalo Bills

New England Patriots

New York Jets

Miami Dolphins

Montreal Rapids (new franchise)



**-AFC North-**

Baltimore Ravens

Cincinnati Bengals

Cleveland Browns

Indianapolis Colts (moved from AFC South)

Pittsburgh Steelers



**-AFC South-**

Kentucky Bluegrass (new franchise)

Houston Texans

Jacksonville Jaguars

Mexico City Aztecs (new franchise)

Tennessee Titans




**-AFC West-**

Denver Broncos

Kansas City Chiefs

Oakland Raiders

Salt Lake City Snowcats (new franchise - Black Diamonds would be a cool name too)

San Diego Chargers




**-NFC East-**

Dallas Cowboys

London Bridges (new franchise)

New York Giants

Philadelphia Eagles

Washington Warriors (new name with same emblem)



**-NFC North-**

Chicago Bears

Detroit Lions

Green Bay Packers

Minnesota Vikings

Toronto Argonauts (new franchise - CFL team disbands)



**-NFC South-**

Atlanta Falcons

Carolina Panthers

New Orleans Saints

San Antonio Caballeros (new franchise)

Tampa Bay Buccaneers




**-NFC West-**

Arizona Cardinals

Portland Roses (new franchise)

San Francisco 49ers

Seattle Seahawks

St. Louis Rams
