	<TEXT> Thank you /u/lilypetal! I love your suggestion about natural sunlight, I will have to rearrange our room but I think I can work it. And I hadn't thought about the spills, either. I imagine that as nice as a wood finish would look it would be horrible for stains.   </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Need help buying/making a battlestation for my fianc! </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Hi ladies of /r/makeupaddiction! I need your help.

My fianc's birthday is coming up, and I thought the perfect gift would be to buy or put together a make up battlestation for her. I am willing to spend a lot of time on it, and my budget is not really capped.

In terms of advice, I'm really looking for ideas on what features you'd like in your own make up stations and how to go about sourcing the materials. Mirror styles and types, storage zones (make up and jewelery potentially?), shelving, new make up to buy her to include and the physical design of the entire thing. The area I have available is a space of about 2.5m x 1m. 

Pictures of your own dedicated make up areas would be appreciated as well as I really have no idea what I'm up against.

You are all amazing, THANK YOU!

	<TEXT> Yeah I recognized the casino. I work in the city and I saw a protest go past at around midday, some wearing guy Fawkes masks. I heard it is uni students protesting cuts to the federal government's tertiary funding to fund the Gonski reforms. But I could be wrong. </TEXT>
