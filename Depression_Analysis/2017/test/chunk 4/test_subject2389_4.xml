	<TEXT> Hey man, I hope you don't feel humiliated anymore. My bro broke his neck and was in a spinal unit too. Everyone there shits themselves. He's out now and still occasionally shits the bed. We just tell him not to worry and wash the sheets. If your people don't understand your medical condition leads to you sometimes having accidents then you need new people. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 100% agree. I loved Harry Potter and the Artemis Fowl series is the only other thing that ever came close. Don't know what every one else is on about, I loved every book in the series, the ending was perfect and brought it full circle. I bought every book the day it came out, same as HP. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Met my ex 2 weeks before I was leaving the country to live in England for a year. 

6 months later he came over to visit me, took me to Amsterdam, Paris and Ireland.

We were staying in a castle in Ireland when I told me he loved me and I lost my virginity to him while Rocky Horror Picture Show played in the background. 

I got the guts up to say it back to him the next morning. Very, very timidly...  
Looking back I think I only said it because it felt like the right thing to do. I love him as a friend still but I never felt as strongly about him as he did about me. </TEXT>
