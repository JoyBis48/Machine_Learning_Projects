	<TEXT> I know that combat is not the focus and that spells aren't worth it but i'd still like to be able to create my own (with rulesystem) even if that means my character won't use them mostly. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I know magic is hard and has repercussion but i still want to play a sorceror type of character and would the system be apopriate for something based of SCP?

freeform system would be best if there is such a thing as in M:taw or rules for spell creation. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Would i be able to play as a character made for Nobilis (As in the players are incarnations of an aspect of reality ie: fire, swords,cats-with-blue-eyes,etc?) the characters are IMMENSlY powerful beings limited to their resources (miracle points) that can only be recharged when they role-play well(It' kinda tricky to get them back so most just hoard them for a long long time). 

some of them are immortal tough as in immortal cannot die kind of way.

they have complete control over their aspect (if they can spend the MP for it) BUT they also must protect it otherwise he will get weaker and weaker until that aspect is completly removed from existence.

and some have items or abilities that are very powerful but also cost MP to use.

i think it'd be fun mortal characters interacting with characters like that striking deals with "Gods" and such.

Could this be the dat where i find a Sandbox game that allows me to play with my characters from Nobilis?

If you'd like more details or wanna discuss things feel free to do ask. </TEXT>
