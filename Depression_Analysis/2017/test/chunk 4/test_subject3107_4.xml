	<TEXT> **Defying Gravity** because when I hit the notes I feel like a princess and when I don't it's still a hell of a lot of fun. 

**Chandelier** channels my inner shower goddess. 

**La Vie en Rose** because it's absolutely gorgeous. 

**I Won't Say I'm in Love** because it's my favourite Disney song. 

**Bang Bang** and **Drunk in Love** because there's so much room to mess around. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It might not be smart to keep the file and its contents in your home.  As the investigation progresses they will almost certainly search your property. You're going to have to find a secure place to hide it. </TEXT>
