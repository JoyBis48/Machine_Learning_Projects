	<TEXT> If you have a Twitter, follow Orlando Informer or just check the page. It was a Godsend for helping plan everything. Try to go as early as you can if you plan on riding Escape from Gringotts, don't know how busy it still is, but less than half an hour after early entry, there was a 5 hour wait not counting general admission times. The train is a must! Make sure to ride to Hogsmeade and back to Diagon Alley. It's a different ride. If I were you, I would go straight to the Studios side, before it gets too crowded. The butter beer ice cream was amazing, and chocolate has a kick at the end. The mixing station doesn't taste too well. Just flavored water. You must watch the Deathly Hallows show in Diagon Alley! Also, get an interactive wand and look out for places to use it. The chicken sandwich, Guinness stew, and cottage pie is delicious in The Leaky Caldron. The Three Broomsticks have wonderful chicken. Sorry it's so long! Have fun! </TEXT>

There's a lot of recipes on here, but my boyfriend and I love the first one! Apparently it's good if you add butterscotch schnapps if you're 21! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, thank you for that. Exactly you're question is based on what we don't know. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I had always assumed the egg still had the spell that made it impossible to obtain through the accio spell, so he knew he couldn't use the spell. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hagrid never graduated. Maybe I should have said graduate. My apologies. As for the other part, I've never read or heard anything like that. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think that Hermione would lead the way for more freedom for house elves who wanted to be free, but less cruelty for the ones who still work. I don't think Harry would live in a mansion. I think he's much too modest for that. As weird as it may seem, I think Neville might be headmaster. He's fair and brave, with Harry's influence it might be possible. I believe Luna would go on to be editor of the popular newspaper The Quibbler because of the fall of the Dark Lord, no one trusted The Daily Prophet anymore, and Luna lead the way to discover the creatures she always claimed existed. I like to think Hagrid ended up married the the Ms. Maxime and having children, who were the first humanoids allowed in Hogwarts. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't know how accurate it is, but while riding the Hogwarts Express. You can hear Ron ask Hermione to conjure food, and she says it's against the law of Transfiguration. That could be the only thing I could think would explain it. </TEXT>
