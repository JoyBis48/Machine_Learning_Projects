im hoping that these sites convert once html5 video gets a little more traction.  
And yes the awful works-on-Chrome mentality is more than bearable these days _ </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  The problem is with the open source community is that they too content with what they have, they don't see lack of good GUI tools on Linux a problem because they use the command line anyway

Dont feel that way, we wanted Office, we've got LibreOffice and OpenOffice.  We wanted a alternative to 3ds max/Maya(though maya runs on Linux) we got blender and its going places. Alternative to Autodesk Sketchbook, we've got Krita and MyPaint. Corel Draw/Illustrator - Inkscape, SynFig.  
There is an abundance of good software, i'll admit some of these having a learning curve but they are worth the time spent!   
The community has never kept quiet, we've kept demanding, its just the commercial bigshots are ignorant, and the community had to figure out its own version of things.

	<TEXT>  Contests for UI and UX do not work (that is what "everyone feels qualified to criticize the UI and suggest improvements" would be). 

i think if mock-ups are shown to the public or demo-ed, then people can vote on the best implementation.  
Also people who have a better concept should be given consideration and voted along with the other concepts.  
GIMP has quite a long release cycle, so this should be possible.

I guess it's a typo 

GIMP ui currently is way better than what Blender was in the initial days. But blender has picked up, polished it self and has a much better UI today but the most important thing is that it's still Blender.  
There is a learning curve to both these software's, but something about UI/UX is important to have a really smooth work flow.

The UI could use a fix, many other features can be smoothened out, yes Photoshop and Gimp are different, that should remain, but there are things like cmyk etc. that still haven't happened. A drive like this should enable users to vote on a set features they want to see implemented in time frame.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We all know that there is no Photoshop on Linux and I dont think Adobe has any plans to make one.    
GIMP is the best thing available but IMHO it hasn't reached that level of perfection we would like. Yes, it does a lot of things Adobe can do and sometime even better but theres a feel that something's missing.    
Krita another OSS app went for a successful Kickstarter funding recently(https://krita.org/item/krita-2-9-0-the-kickstarter-release/) and its helped the software and the community pretty well.  
Im sure lots of users out there would like GIMP to reach the top, many want a true Photoshop alternative thats simple to use and looks good.  
What are your thought /r/gimp ?  Wouldn't such a funding campaign help GIMP progress as the app we want? </TEXT>

EDIT - about the Liberation Sans, i think its wise to file a bug report to debian to make them aware of the issue on the choppiness of the font, so that they can rectify it! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> From Wiki:  
"Microsoft has several patents in the United States on subpixel rendering technology for text rendering on RGB Stripe layouts. This had caused FreeType, the library used by most current software on the X Window System, to disable this functionality by default.[4]

Apple was able to use it in Mac OS X due to a patent cross-licensing agreement.[12]

The patents 6,219,025, 6,239,783, 6,307,566, 6,225,973, 6,243,070, 6,393,145, 6,421,054, 6,282,327, 6,624,828 were filed between 1998-10-07 and 1999-10-07, thus should expire in 2019-10-07" </TEXT>

http://www.webupd8.org/2013/06/better-font-rendering-in-linux-with.html  
Any of these 2 methods will drastically improve font rendering, Infinality will also mimic other OS's font rendering mechanism.  
And your browser is also responsible, for some unknown reason Chrome is sub-par at font rendering, do try out Firefox, its simply good these days.  
Also the Liberation Sans font is choppy(if on fedora[maybe other Linux's too] - reported bug but no action has been made yet)

EDIT - There are patents preventing these from enabled by default which is why its left to the users choice </TEXT>

I have it installed on my system (fedora 21) but even in LibreOffice the font is not properly anti-aliased/hinted. Something wrong i guess with the font, will try find a fix for that!

	<DATE> 2015-02-07 11:52:05 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hello r/debian  
im almost on the verge to get debian for my old system as i found out it will run on hardware(512MB Core Duo) a few years back.  
But as i went to download the live installation media, i found out 2 version's - gnome and standard?  
Whats the difference between those two?  
I'm looking for a gnome desktop as natural because ive been used to it with Fedora a long time.   
Does the standard ship with the gnome desktop or do i have to get the gnome iso as such.   
Also is the installation text based or GUI?   

EDIT - SOLVED - i got the info i wanted to know! Thank you kind people of /r/debian ! :D  
If you do have more info to share, please do! :) </TEXT>
