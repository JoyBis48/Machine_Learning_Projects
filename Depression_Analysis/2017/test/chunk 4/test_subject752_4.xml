	<TEXT> I agree, but in the same breath sometimes takes competing formats to determine the best winner for the consumer. However the obvious question is can such an 'alien' technology survive the invariable comparison between 2 proprietary formats?

Spelling mistakes.

Advertising masquerading as "news articles" 
 
Extremely biased articles.
 
Very piss poorly researched articles. 
(Aka: people who abuse the party X when a quick Google forces to light they're actually lying through their teeth.)

Poorly executed articles. 
(Aka: look out for rampant  weed X which should be reported to MAF, but didn't bother to include a photo)

	<TEXT> Nice. 

Looks like a very well rounded device, they've addressed quite a few complaints about the S5 - speaker placement, camera quality, build quality, fingerprint scanner, heartrate monitor, TouchWiz GUI.

And just improved upon what makes Samsung devices really nice - Screen quality.

I'm sure they implemented some wizardry with the Exynos and the AMOLED as there was an article in /r/android last night fron Engadget a while ago. They implemented stuff like ignoring refreshing pixels that don't change based upon what's on the screen, which helped up to 10% better battery life on the S5, little doubt this has helped the battery last so long despite the bump in pixels on the S6.

For a start  "As an example, with a day that was full of gaming and picture taking, the battery died just past the 10 hour mark." how completely unscientific can you be? Couldn't they at least posted SOT or battery stats of this?

And then in the "positives" putting "Battery life just above average" that doesn't sound like a positive to me.

And the camera review, what a fucking joke he didn't even clean the camera lens, you can tell by the massive light ghosting in the bar shots there's grease on the lens.

Feels like this phone was handed to someone who's owned a few smart phones, felt like they were a pro in reviewing and went to the bar, had a few beers and wrote this up in an hour or two.

They are still the only aluminium and glass high end phone available in most markets, why change what works?
The reviews for the latest device aren't anywhere near as scathing as the S5 reviews (Remember everyone's favourite catchup for bagging the S5? -"Evolution over revolution") so while it's not the best move they played it safe.

They may not have Samsung's mega dollars to be able to release an entirely new device within the short life cycle that people are coming to expect from cellphone makers these days, and why would they?
The market responded [favourably](https://au.finance.yahoo.com/echarts?s=2498.TW#symbol=2498.TW;range=) to the move, so actually they've done quite well. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hold on there, I'm not talking an escalator- I'm talking a luggage carousel - you know the type that the baggage handlers put the luggage on. 

For a start [they can easily trap fingers and hands](http://www.philstar.com/metro/2013/08/12/1079731/naia-worker-gets-hand-stuck-baggage-conveyor) and then they took it through to an OSH and security nightmare, that provides direct access to the tarmac. At every airport I've ever been there are signs saying don't ride the carousel, and don't go through the curtain.. 

I would expect a 5 year old to do this, not a ***16 and 17 years old*** </TEXT>

They knowingly took it upon themselves to enter an area that was off limits while representing a school they attend. 
At the very least they had no thoughts for how this might reflect upon the school, let alone the poor teacher/aide who was suppose to be watching them.

Let's say, worst case scenario from their little trip- they could have shut the whole fucking airport down for 30 minutes inconveniencing hundreds of people.

	<TEXT> This isn't "catastrophic" but it is a joke.

The S6 uses both the CPU and storage speed boost for really nifty things like increasing the camera boot time to allow you to open it very quickly with only a couple taps of the home button. 
A slower processor and this would not be possible.

Also the mobile industry falls heavily upon benchmarks, and graphs to show better phone, the majority of people never really play with their flash new device for any more than a few minutes in stores, so rely on the internet to prove why it should buy 1 device over another.

A difference of 23000 *benchmark* points most certainly will pull those with no brand loyalty to the faster device. 

There is no other draw card HTC have here. (And don't you dare mention design, if they wanted design they would have already bought the M8 over the S5. You can't panda to the same audience for 3 years running (aluminium and glass) without nearing the saturation point in a lot of markets. 

HTC needed a "Wow factor" and this chipset is not it. </TEXT>

"It's not going to make a shit phone, it's an awesome phone, it's **just** running a shit processor."

"It's not going to be any slower than a Samsung S6, benchmarks don't mean anything in the real world."

"They didn't throttle the chip, it's just software tweaks."

HTC have had YEARS to play with the 810.. (Seriously, phone development takes at least 2+ years from drawing board to anything close to fruition. Even when you're only tweaking the previous iteration)

And this is the *best* they could come up with!?

Go on, downvote me, you know damn well I'm right. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would disagree, I reliably got 12 hours standby + 4 hours SOT with my S4. 
And by reliably I mean for 6 plus months this was my consistant benchmark. 
If I got less than that I knew and hunted down the Application responsible.

When it dropped consistantly to 3 hours SOT plus 12 hours standby I did a factory reset and that took it back up to 4 hours.. So the key to any good measure is reliability, SOT is able to be a reliable benchmark. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As would I, the frustration however arises from when minorities are allowed concessions that the majority does not feel are warranted by their requirements, or religious beliefs.

This potentially stems from a few things:

* Misunderstanding the core religious laws which require consumer law to be changed in order to comply. 
* Frustration at the laws passed for religious reasons that allow a religious person a significant concession while still applying the same law heavily upon non-believers.

Surely you can understand the frustration when one must relinquish their tweezers, while a potentially sharp metal object designed to protect oneself is allowed on board without question due to ones religious beliefs. </TEXT>

I thought it was due to the ethanol sinking to the bottom of the water, but thank you for explaining it's mixed throughout the drink. I think in my particular circumstance /u/MoltenSlag has hit the nail on head in that it's due to the fizzy escaping the drink, coupled with a rise in temperature, makes sense.

	<TEXT> We have deceptive times on Google between major landmarks, allow +1 hour for most journeys on your GPS.

Most of our motorways out of the major arterial routes are unlit, unpoliced and barely maintained so require constant vigilance. 

We do sometimes have wandering livestock, but not very often.

And unfortunately you have to contend with the average Kiwi Driver who greatly over estimates their driving abilities. 

Basic rules to be mindful of: 

* Do NOT expect people to stop at STOP signs.
* Do not EVER expect people will see you on the road.
* Expect pedestrians to not look before stepping out on the road. 
* Expect drivers to not hear your horn (wearing headphones while driving is a common passtime.)
* Do not expect to just 'find a park' any where, at any point in time, always give +10 minutes to find a park in most central areas.
* Expect drivers to tailgate badly (Seriously, NZ drivers love acting like the human equivalent of hemorrhoids. 
* Expect drivers will speed up during passing lanes (120+km/h)
* Further to the above expect drivers to be driving slowly on the motorway (80-90km/h)
* Do no expect drivers to indicate
* Expect drivers to pull out without looking 
* When approaching a T intersection expect cars coming around the corner to cut into your lane
* Basically expect dangerously
* Not obeying Stop signs, Give way signs, or any kind of sign for that matter
* Driving dangerous driving at all times. 
* Be surprised when Drivers obey the road rules
* Etc..

Edit: I'm from Chch and I encounter the above on a daily basis and I only travel about an hour or around 35km a day. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree with your point, although even your example has a tinge of arrogance - only looking one way when we're all taught to look both ways regardless.

If your assessment is correct, and complacency and drivers revert to a 'comfortable' level of driving on our roads then I can't help but wonder how/if we can even approach this from an education standpoint, I guess the arrows on the road are a good step, but a quick test (as many propose) would quickly become a distant memory when passing the 15th dead possum on the road from Nelson to Twizel, rendering any skills learnt at arrival void as one slips back to their standard routine.

How can you even stop this? I honestly don't think you can. (Except for the billboards advising tired drivers etc to pull over - but if they can't read English or have a tight schedule they won't care?) </TEXT>
