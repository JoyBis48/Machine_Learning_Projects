	<TEXT> Browns fan here. Totally bantering, but as a rule I try not to ever vote on other teams lists, and I havent thrown a slur, but some really aggro people from this list go to instantly accusing folks of "Vote Brigading" (which is a cool term I had never heard before) even though some of us follow reddiquette. Not saying I havent voted, just that I vote consciously and not to just punish a post, and I reiterate: I try to follow a rule of not voting on other subs. But are we really telling on each other and getting in a twist? We are telling the REDDIT MODS? Really? We are supposed to be like Goku and Vegita. (We're Goku) and we love to hate each other, and we take our lumps from each other, and we do it with pride and honor. *EDIT I can hate you, but I actually tell other teams fans when they get shitty about you guys, that they need to shut their mouths, because they dont know you well enough to hate you like that.* Come on. Brothers who kick the shit out of each other, but going to mom and tattling? We're better than that. Let's handle things in house and just duke it out when need be. Buck up. You've done this 18 of the last 20 times. That being said: Why isnt the sidebar changed for our bet? *Edit: And I upvoted this thread* </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I just tried it out with some of the Pork I am cooking, and it got done in around an hour and a half at 350. Redux was chardonnay. Mirepoix was carrot, garlic, and mushroom (onion allergy coming to the event and didnt have celery) and then did a Bouquet Garni of thyme rosemary and sage. It turned out amazing. I have a picture on my phone that WONT UPLOAD. Thank you all for your help. I'll try to share some pics in an update after the event!   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We are doing a harvest festival and I am in charge of the kitchen. Instead of cutting the meat small, I have cut the meat in large, rustic chunks of about 2-2 1/2 inches cubed. I want to serve 4 or 5 on the plate with the meal. My question is: What is the besy way to cook the meat? Roasting? Stewing? Pan cooking(which sounds very time consuming)? Or what? Im not sure. I have 3 meals to make like this, so I have to do this three times. I am a really good cook, so I can do just about anything needed, I just dont know what is the best way to do this. Please help.

So I was trying to figure out if I should go with Hoyer as the beast he is, or Brady as the beast he is supposed to be but hasnt been at all this year? So I asked [The Guru] (http://imgur.com/VbOlabc). Das Guru doesnt even have Hoyer ranked (BS) and he has 6 fantasy points on average more than Brady on the year. And their suggestion is Brady over Hoyer. The lack of a ranking is mind blowing to me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I [told the Ravens sub](http://www.reddit.com/r/ravens/comments/26mas5/ravens_4th_round_draft_pick_rb_lorenzo_taliaferro/chsepzu) when their people started getting in trouble (specifically this was about Lorenzo Taliaferro) that it was Karma. I even wrote a story, and was downvoted and told I was a stupid Browns Fan, and then I was accused of "Running to my sub for upvotes" (which I was too new to know that was a thing). I am reposting my story here, again, in light of Ray Rice, and the Raven fan-base can Dawg my Bone if they dont like it. The truth stings:

**My Story of The Ravens, Art Model, and the Devil**:*The Ravens were created after Baltimore made a deal with the Devil. So many angry prayers smoldered through the earth into the bowels of the Devils play place. Day and night he was assaulted with the lamentations of the lost souls, pining for their Colts. Finally the Son of Light heard a call that would end his suffering: Art Modell was weak, and was begging for release. So Lucifer, that wily old devil, whispered into the ears of each of the most powerful people in Baltimore and within the Browns, and a deal was struck! That deal included 2 SB, and safety from any lasting harm that may come against any of his players and original staff that took part in the move. In return the Browns would move to Baltimore, and in a seperate trade for his immortal soul Belichick obtained his own deal, but that will be a story for another day. And so it was that a faithful and historic football city the likes of Cleveland was stripped of their team, and Baltimores prayers were answered. But oldschool fans know in their hearts which side answered their prayers that day. It is within each true original Baltimore Colts fan. That seed. That knowledge that it was not a godsend. It came from the other direction. And they know when he came to collect. The Super Bowl in the Super Dome. That light failure was no fluke. That was the Prince of Darkness showing up to watch the final moments of his deal. You won. And so did he. And now that Devils deal Baltimore made has come around to the other side, as all deals eventually do. I have a feeling that you will be seeing much more of this as the balance exherts itself. Safe travels, friends.* *edit:formatting*
