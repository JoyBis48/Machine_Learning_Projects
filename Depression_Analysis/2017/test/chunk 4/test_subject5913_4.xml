	<TEXT> I'm gonna be moving to Salt Lake City late May/early June and I'm currently looking for an apartment. There are a few places that I would like to live because they are near stores and the rent is fairly cheap. I don't have a car or license, so it's crucial that I find a place with lots of public transportation. I found a place with really cheap rent in South Salt Lake. The apartment complex is called "La Porte Properties Apartments, this is the address:2505 South State, Salt Lake City, UT 84115. I looked at the place on google maps, street view, but from what I saw, it really doesn't seem like a nice place. Not bad, but not nice. I couldn't really find if there was a trax line(I believe that's what it's called) anywhere. I couldn't find any shopping centers anywhere near the place, either. For someone who doesn't have a car, is this not a good place to live?  </TEXT>
