	<TEXT> Only a few degrees allow one to practice medicine, meaning they can diagnose diseases and prescribe medication. M.D., D.O., dentists, podiatrists, and I think optometrists all qualify. A Ph.D. bestows the honorific "doctor," but you can't do medical things. Psychotherapy isn't medical practice, and many therapists have Ph.D.s. But most Ph.D.s don't care to be called "doctor" except in certain professional settings where the credential is socially valuable. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Orthography and etymology do matter in making distinctions; words that took different paths to the same pronunciation are not automatically the "same word," and definitely not if their spelling differs, as in this case. There's an argument that rake/rake are different words because of their histories as well as meanings, with ho/hoe the difference is much clearer. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Reminds me of a too-high-atop-the-pizza-parlor story. This is secondhand, but I have no reason to doubt it. When I was an assistant manager at a Pizza Hut, back when they all had those peaked red roofs, the story went around of a manager of one of the busiest PHs in the city who had decided that the attic space under the roof was the perfect place to go smoke weed after he got off work. It was summer, so it was pretty hot up there, and he stripped to his underwear. 

Now, there's a reason they always told us never to store things in the attic space: The "floor" isn't designed to hold weight. The manager was walking around up there, when he suddenly crashed through the floor *into the dining area* which was full of people eating. He got up, ran out the door (still in his underwear), and was never heard from again. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Interesting, I take almost the opposite approach. I:

* don't use shampoo or soap above the neck, and my skin is nice and smooth and soft as a result.
* don't use shaving soap or cream. I don't even use water. I grab the razor as soon as I'm out of the shower and get to work. (This order is crucial; if I wait even 10 minutes, things get rough.) 
* only shave once; it's all that's needed.

It took a while before my skin got used to dry shaving, and in the meantime I experimented with oil instead of cream or soap; it worked fine, but it gunked up my razor. At some point I just wondered what would happen if I didn't use anything at all, so I tried it and liked it.

Possibly relevant: I use a double-edge safety razor, not one of those multiblade replaceable-head ones. It took a bit of getting used to, but now I wouldn't use anything else. One key is to be gentle and not use much pressure. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Shampoo and soap. I stopped using both above the neck a few years ago, and my skin and hair are both in great shape. I do shower every day, including rinsing my hair.

I'm way past my teen years, so I can't speak for the effects on acne. But I wish I'd known to try this back then. 

NOTE: You have to give it at least a week before things will normalize; for a few days your face and scalp will feel oily. It'll get better. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That may be the "right" thing to do, but we should harbor no illusions that anyone at the church will be swayed. [WBC is a Primitive Baptist Calvinist church](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/susan-kraus/westboro-baptist-church-rebecca-barrett-fox_b_4997296.html); its doctrine teaches that all people outside the church, and possibly some within it, are damned to eternal hellfire. Messages of kindness and love will sound to them like Charlie Brown's teacher -- Wa-wa-WA wa-wa wa-wa-WA.

I'm not saying we shouldn't take the high road; I'm saying that if we do, it's for our benefit and the benefit of others outside WBC. We just shouldn't fool ourselves about having an effect on the Phelpses themselves. </TEXT>
