	<TEXT> He may not have had financial success, but Firefly, buffy and Angel were extremely good shows, and Serenity was a really great movie, with lots of nice directorial flourishes. It way outweighed stuff like Zathura, or even the first Iron man in terms of quality. I'm sure the new director will do a good job, but it won't be Edgar Wright quality. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Basically, the x men comics have a massive cast of loved characters and villains, around as many as the rest of the marvel universe alone. Rather than build up these individual characters, Ratner chose to include as many as he possibly could and ruin them all. For example, the Juggernaut is an entirely different character in the comics, and his appearance is equivalent to The hulk turning up in the avengers as a guy who can just turn green when he wants to. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In my personal opinion it just felt more like it kept getting beaten, but then escaping on technicalities or Dues ex machina. First the corps capture it, then it uses a unseen previously ability to escape in human form, and you expect their to be a actual human v human fight or chase, mixing up the action, but that doesn't appear. Then Erens team essentially defeat it again, only for it to use more superpowers to kill a team of highly trained professionals. (who all decide to run into it) Then it beats Eren in a fight, which takes forever (altrhough it did legitimately win that time), and then Levi defeats it AGAIN but it's still pointless and we're still, apparently meant to think it 'won' when it got it's ass kicked for the last few episodes. The last arc is much better IMO because the stakes are actually grounded, we know what the female titan can do, and it doesn't pull any powers out of it's ass. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sorry about the spoiler thing, I couldn't get the spoiler tag to work so just left it vague. I honestly felt like it didn't remain compelling after the first capture, she's still running around in titan form, which we have seen be caught, and then it's just watching her *almost* get caught again and again. It's not moving the plot forward, it's just watching people fail for fairly contrived reasons. (particularly once Levi comes in) I actually really liked the arc after it, where it actually feels like an even fight, but for half the recon corps arc, I was personally bored. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's an interesting point. Gaurdians of the galaxy has a draw far superior to TMNT, but aims at the same audience in multiple ways. It will also be the superior sci-fi film. (barring a disaster) Given the option of seeing TMNT or guardians of the galaxy, GOTG will win 99 times out of 100. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In the UK, pretty much everyone is a Sherlock fan, so it certainly sold well over here. The hobbit is also a damn well made movie, and almost certainly has more care put into than TMNT. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You don't seem to be able to understand that the new Godzilla movie has all the trappings of being a good movie, whereas the nearly 15 year old Roland Emmerich  movie had all the trappings of being shit. Are you really saying that the trailers/clips for the new Godzilla movie look like a 'bullshit monster movie with a shit story?' </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sci-fi/fantasy films need to be **good** (or at least not unbearably tedious)to really make traction in the box office, particularly if they're a new IP. Hercules seems to be aiming solely for a 3-star/2 star range, and, like prince of persia, it will fail. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It has a lot to do with how complex the swinging mechanics are, both from a coding and conceptual perspective. Things like momentum and building physics take a more concerted effort to recreate than almost everything else in the game. There's also the fact that Treyarch are just better devs than Beenox, of course they'll make a better game in the time than Beenox churning it out in time for the movie release.


There are lot's of old, great game mechanics that have been lost due to the industry cutting corners. Goldeneye and half life had a tonne of mechanics (such as shootable NPC's) that industry is too scared to use, because it might ruin their carefully crafted narratives. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The POV character for that segment could easily be a film lead. It's subtle, but on re-reading I noticed that the character was involved in every major campaign of the zombie war, and was the only person to go from yonkers to the final battle. Max brooks was essentially interviewing (in universe) America's greatest war hero, but didn't introduce him as such because he assumed you would have already known about him. That's a pretty great idea for a film, in my opinion. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The movie is kind of lame in general if you're a sci-fi guy. IMO  it would be a much better film if it wasn't so embarrassed to embrace the tropes it rips off. Even though it's still a great film, it's redundant in the face of better written/ more crowd pleasing Massive monster affair. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> From what I remember, that triggered the monsters release from hibernation or something. They didn't really have a predefined 'lore' so a lot of it is contradictory/red herrings, technically, they released a manga meant to clarify stuff, but that had a lot of supernatural elements (Clover was the ghost of a 14 year old or something)


The funny thing about cloverfield is that with the resurgence of Godzilla, pacific rim, and to a lesser extent things like attack on titan and EVA, the market for 'reinventions of the Kaiju genre' has pretty much dried up, so you really may as well view pacific rim as a sequel. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Eh, it will take quite a while to compile all the various sites/theories/magazine articles that I read years ago, but from what I remember, slusho (the company on logo's and T-Shirts throughout the film) having been drilling in the sea to try to find more of a 'secret ingredient' they put in their drinks, I don't believe it's ever specified, but at the bottom of a sea trench they find clover in a crack in the ground, so it lines up quite well with pacific rim. What is most important is that Cloverfield is essentially a generic kaiju movie, just told from an unconventional perspective, so it's as easy to say 'pacific rim and cloverfield take place in the same universe' as to say 'Godzilla and pacific rim are in the same universe' </TEXT>

In the 80's: essentially every character in the x-men
In the 90's: Most of the x-men, oracle starts to develop
2000's: almost every heroine written by Gail simone, particularly Batgirl and Black canary
Now: Marvels's pulled a lot of it back, with black widow and Ms marvel being popular. It's worth noting that most of these characters are actually more famous than Wonder woman in the comics community. I'm a big comics guy, and can tell you tonnes about every one of these characters EXCEPT wonder woman. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Nope, KLK is not suited for a videogame, the art style is too complex to be done with cel shading, not complex enough to be done with 3D models, not to mention a lot is done in a semi-warner bros style. The only way it could work is as a hand drawn 2D fighter or as a RPG. It's not suited for an action game. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think the 'who will play Wiseau?' question will be quite interesting, as the way the book describes him, he's such a bizarre character that it would be near impossible for someone to make him look believable (the accent alone would be really hard to pull off) but if you've read the book, you'd also know you'd never **ever** want him anywhere near your film set. It's kind of like trying to get an actor to play Karl Pilkington; sometime life just throws up characters stranger than fiction. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would personally like to see some western Sci-fi games developed into anime. Deux ex, Mass effect, Halo, that sort of thing, However, in terms of what would realistically get adapted a monster hunter Anime could be really neat, but only if they make it considerably darker than the games convey. (graphically) Monster Hunter could potentially have a really interesting world/action scenes if they let it. </TEXT>
