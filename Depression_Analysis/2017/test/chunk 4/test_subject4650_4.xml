I haven't ridden the FZ09 yet - it's on the list - but you can pick those old Hornets up super cheap in my part of town and I'm forever looking at them in the paper and going "hmmmmm..."

The Speed Triple, if you can stretch for one of those, is the [best bike in the whole world ever](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDNrRX6EzWA). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Right - not to mention how deflating it is to your sense of self belief to take on the best team in the league without your #3 offensive option and best defender. OKC plays on emotion, this is a killer.

	<TEXT> Nothing about OKC's stagnant, iso-heavy offence convinced me they'd beat the spurs even when Ibaka was healthy. Ibaka is their most important defensive asset and their #3 option at the other end. They might get a win or two but I think they're finished, especially since the Spurs have a great defender to put on KD, and home court advantage to boot. </TEXT>
