	<TEXT> Well, call me selfish, but the more it's in the public, the more popular it will get, and the more attention it will receive from authorities. If head shops didn't sell it, it would never even garner any attention from anybody, you know? Sure, responsible people find out about it in head shops and start using it. Kids and people looking for legal highs find out about it too. I would rather just keep it out of the public's eye. I'm sure there's an honest head shop here and there, but it's just not fuckin worth all the publicity it causes kratom to receive, whether it's from honest head shops or elsewhere. Hell, even bath salts and spice would still be legal if it wasn't for head shops (not that they should be, but that's beside the point). Funny thing is, a lot of junkies are too myopic to order stuff from the internet, whether it's from a darknet market or from a website. Doesn't matter if it's cheaper, doesn't matter if it's safer, they can't wait a few days for it to show up. I showed all my friends how to use Silk Road, you know how many used it besides me? One. Just one, and he wasn't opioid dependent, which may have played a role. All the rest just didn't want to wait. Nobody ever wants to wait. Also, most of the junkies I know don't have a debit card, they couldn't order any bath salts from the internet if they wanted to, because they don't have the ambition to actually get a fuckin debit card, and that alone would always stop them. If bath salts and spice never hit head shops, they would both still be legal. They'd just be another couple of obscure research chemicals. TL;DR All head shops aren't bad, but they're all bad news for the fight to keep kratom legal. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I imagine they don't buy hard drugs cuz they can't get them. I definitely want head shops to stop selling it. I've never even seen it in a head shop (I haven't been to one in years) but from what I gather, they mostly sell extracts, right? Just goes to show that they're trying to peddle a legal high, and not an herbal remedy... like most of us here see it as. "Bath salts" or "spice" are all the assholes and feds think when they see the shit in head shops. It's a fucked up situation man, and the shit causes me a great deal of anxiety. I don't know what I'll do if it ever gets banned. I hate to think of going on a darknet market for the shit. Next thing I know, I'll have grams of ice and H showing up at my doorstep. But, we all know that for each stupid mother fucker that abuses it and buys it in head shops, there's 10 people that buy it on the internet and use it to improve their lives in a responsible manner. It undoubtedly does more good than harm, I just hope the lawmakers can see that if the unfortunate situation arises. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I just called Thailand and told them they've got a kratom smuggler comin in hot in about 3 hours. You might wanna start sticking fingers up your bunghole now so it doesn't hurt so bad when they get their hands on ya. Maybe you can pay another passenger some kratom to help you out with it. I heard wieners work best for that sort of thing. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I dose 3 times a day, about 5 grams each time. I never take any sort of tolerance break. Sometimes I feel extra sassy, and dose a fourth time. If I do that two days in a row, my tolerance goes up a little... I feel it less the next day, but as long as I only take it 3 times that day, it'll be back to normal the day after. I think it's all about finding the perfect dose. I also mix greens with red. </TEXT>

I love chewin on kratom but I dose at like 6:30 am, and I don't get a dip in until about 7:45 when I get to work. I can't say it really affects the kratom either way for me, although I am pretty much fiending for it by the time I get to work. I just find it makes me want the chaw more. However, thanks to the chaw, I drink about a gallon of water a day... it just makes me so thirsty. I know hydration is especially important when taking kratom, so it works out, as far as I'm concerned. </TEXT>
