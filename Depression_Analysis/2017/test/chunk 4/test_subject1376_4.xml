	<TEXT> I agree in that this is something I would do as well, however I can respect someone for creating something useful to keep them focused and immersed in their work and sharing it. I can never learn that lesson. For example, here I am on reddit again instead of finishing the last 25% of that mindmap I've been putting off. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> All of tech feels that way for everyone eventually. Before the internet we used to animate stuff in [Macromedia Director](http://www.amazon.com/Macromedia-Director-Dummies-Computer-Tech/dp/0764502247) because every serious business gave out presentation CD's at trade shows. Then the internet came around and prodigy wasn't fast enough for 600 megabyte movie files, which is seriously all the space you are ever going to need my 17-year-old self from the past is trying to remind me.

I don't know what existed before Director. Probably the solitary madness of nothing. </TEXT>
