	<TEXT> I wouldn't call it an egg. I'd call it a run of the mill, porous sedimentary rock that is easily stained by iron from other rocks (and yes, possibly rust/iron/impurities in the water). But it's likely not coming from the inside of the rock. And again, it's not an egg. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Cherokee National Forest area is a great place for finding things. Sometimes you can get permission from local land owners (pay them $20) to let you roam their lands. People have huge parcels out that direction and always need some cash. I bring the dog and off I go. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> North Carolina is known for its precious stones. Emeralds in particular. Also an abundance (relatively, of course) of garnet (almandine for the most part); Hiddenite (only found here); ruby/sapphire (lots but not a lot gem quality). My favorite finds in NC are amazing quartzes, some of which are clear as glass and as large as my hand. Most of these found in Western NC.  </TEXT>
