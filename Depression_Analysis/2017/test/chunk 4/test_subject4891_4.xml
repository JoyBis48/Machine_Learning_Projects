	<TITLE> [Algebra 1] Linear Functions </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-11-13 01:49:26 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> The goal is to create a scenario which can be graphed using a linear-function. 
  My scenario is "Poncho Villegas is a soldier who needs to capture a fort. He needs 600 troops to do so, and currently only has a company of 62 soldiers. He receives a platoon of 16 troops each day. How many days will elapse before Poncho has the required force to conquer the fort?"

How might I solve this? I am having trouble puting this in linear function/equation form. Help me, r/ Homeworkhelp. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>   I have seen Tron and Tron: Legacy. I always loved the derez effect. Whether it was evaporation or programs shattering into thousands of cubical vowels. 
  I have also seen a few episodes of VGHS, and the derez effect is also pretty cool. 
  If you were creating a movie which has a plot centered around a vidya gam or a computer, how would you recreate this effect? </TEXT>
