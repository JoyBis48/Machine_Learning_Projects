	<TEXT> The keyboard the keyboard the keyboard. The keyboard will be a HUGE step up from a simple microsoft membrane. Besides, you already have a headset you like, that upgrade won't be nearly as impressive as the jump to mechanical. 

As for your worries about mechanical keyboards:

* Don't worry about it disturbing you when you play. It won't, besides you use a headset so you'll barely be able to hear it. 
* Don't worry about you not liking it. Unless you are in a VERY small minority, you will absolutely love it and you will wonder how you ever typed without one. 

You can always return it if you REALLY don't like it. Go for the keyboard. You won't regret it.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I totally agree. Intel does offer more performance but bang-for-buck AMD is much better. As a college student on a budget that's what I went with. I have my 6300 OC'd to 4.7 GHz and it performs very well; at this point the only CPU I'd upgrade to is an i7-4770k, which would require a new mobo and quite a bit more money. I'm happy where I am right now.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Better graphics card comes to mind first, then a power supply with more wattage. That's really about it. 

Keep in mind this is a MICRO build, more for portability than anything. If space isn't an issue, get a larger case and a better mobo.  </TEXT>

I got a lot of my parts with good deals which is why the total price is a little high.

	<TEXT> I think people SEVERELY underestimate the value of the touch covers. Here's why:

* Absolutely NO moving parts/greater durability. This is so much better for travel or general "beater" use as there are fewer things to break or get caught in. 

* Greater spill resistance. Spilling liquids on a Type Cover would require a lot more recovery than with a Touch Cover. Unless you've managed to soak it all the way through, a simple wipe-down with a paper towel is all you need to clean a simple Touch Cover spill. 

* Thinner. I know at this point we're talking millimeters of difference but the Touch Covers (especially Touch Cover 2) just feel so much lighter. 

Unless you do a LOT of typing (I'm talking multi-page essays or university assignments), the Touch Cover will be FAR more useful. A thin lightweight cover for your Surface that's good enough for banging out a few emails or urls when needed. 

To directly answer your concern, you can just tap the trackpad anywhere to register a left click and tap with two fingers to register a right click. No need to ever use those dinky buttons below the trackpad.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I love the Surface as much as anyone in the subreddit but I gotta say that ultrabook looks top notch... I would honestly go with that. The slightly better resolution and screen size does it for me. 

I have a Surface RT but I still prefer the traditional laptop/ultrabook build for a primary portable work computer. Sure I know it's basically the same thing with a type cover but the 10.6 inch screen is a *little* too small for heavy working for my taste.  </TEXT>

Having said that, though, I recommend:

* Razer Black Widow Ultimate 2013 Edition Keyboard (BF4 edition if you really want it, but I like the clean Razer green)

* Razer Mamba Mouse. (this is the category where you should REALLY look around yourself, they have TONS of awesome mice.)

* Razer Kraken 7.1 Headset. 

Again, just take a look and see what really suits you.  </TEXT>
