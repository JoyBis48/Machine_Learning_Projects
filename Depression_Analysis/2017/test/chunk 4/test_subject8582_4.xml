	<TEXT> I think I'm actually as religious as I am due in part Evangelion. I was pretty passively religious when I started, being a teenage child of a Christian family. I watched the first four episodes and my only thoughts on the religious imagery were "Oh, it's kind of like if Gundam let Jesus into its heart. I bet we're in for some edgy but ultimately meaningless symbolism." I came out of it still kind of believing that, but it was mostly silenced by something along the lines of **"WHAT IN THE EVERLOVING CRUCIFUCK DID I JUST WATCH"**. Then after the required analyses of the show and its symbols, I started to gain a deep appreciation for not just the religious aspects of Eva, but of Christian lore.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Gamera wasn't Toho, though they did make the '90s movies. 

Anyway, I think after Rodan, Toho started to focus more on Godzilla again. Once King Kong vs Godzilla came out, there wasn't much time for a new Rodan movie because he was in the one after that. The only reason Mothra got her own trilogy is because she was so immensely popular, particularly among women, to the point that Toho decided to appeal to that demographic in particular.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This Wolf O'Donnel bitch organized a Super Smash Bros tournament in my town the other day. He had the standard tournament rules- set stages, double elimination, no items, etc. He would only make an exception for games he was in. He only plays Diddy Kong, so when no one was looking before his match he would set the banana item spawn to as low as it goes. His idea was that since Diddy Kong's Down+B summons a banana anyway, no one would notice the subtle extra banana that would spawn. It didn't even affect his games, he just gets off to the knowledge that he did what he did.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Assuming Godzilla's feats are scaled down from 100m (Final Wars) to 2-3m, each Xenojira is about 3% of the original Goji's power. This means that 100 of them will be 300% of Godzilla's destructive power in total (thanks fan calculations). While I admit I've only seen Alien once, the GojiMorph will still be pretty tough to kill. Each individual Godzilla won't do anything to the GojiMorph, so all the Xenojiras (or at least 33) would have to work together. This poses somewhat of a problem, because Godzilla (Showa fuckness notwithstanding) is more of a lone wolf. After Godzilla vs Mechagodzilla (the '70s one), Godzilla only ever teamed up with Mothra in Final Wars (and even that wasn't really Godzilla and Mothra teaming up, that was Mothra coming in to kill Gigan and Keiser Ghidorah, and Godzilla just happened to be there). 

I suppose the Xenojiras have enough resistance and recovery to realize they can't go it alone, and one will eventually realize that organizing into two or three groups to take down the Gojimorph.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> We were at a local burger place and I was starting to worry, because I know what this little coywolf does in public. But what happened next didn't start with him. Someone a few tables away started having a heart attack. I saw Wolf's eyes light up as he realized that this is what he had been waiting for the entire time. He ran over and ordered a bystander to call 911, checked for a pulse, and gave mouth-to-mouth expertly, as though he ad been professionally certified. It was when he got to chest compressions that the dark truth behind his fucked-up plan was revealed. I only found this out later, but it turns out he actually hangs out at restaurants all over town and waits for people to need CPR. Turns out he actually *tries* to break as many ribs as he can manage while doing the chest compressions. 

The worst part is that because of Good Samaritan laws, nothing he does is *technically* illegal. No one even thinks to try him because he puts on such a good act, consoling their friends or family (if they're present) and most times even checking up on them in the following weeks.  </TEXT>
