	<TEXT> How can you defend this decision? Gyorko was atrocious last year and looks just as bad so far. You're literally going to keep him rostered because some random guy had him on a sleeper post?

Guerrero is killing it. He's done more in the past 4 days what Gyorko will do all week. Worst case scenario, if Guerrero does horrible, just pick Gyorko back up, no one is going to claim him off of waivers. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> He got very lucky last year. Look him up on fangraphs there's a good amount of material on how his peripherals screamed regression for this year. Still a good player, just probably won't repeat last years effectiveness. I'd try to deal him to someone looking to buy low.

	<TEXT> H2H categories. AVG RBI RUN SB SLG

This is a non-keeper league. I keep reading high rankings on Ozuna and I don't really understand it. 25 HR with a 260 average and negligible speed? Doesn't do it for me. Blackmon the concern is he might platoon at his position and his stats outside of coors are underwhelming. Pederson obviously has the highest ceiling, but will have the struggles of a rookie. 

Right now I'm leaning towards Blackmon and Pederson. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah he could be a solid rookie sleeper. For me, his ceiling this season isn't much better than what you'd find in most of the average second baseman available though. So while the cost is dirt cheap, he's a gamble, high risk for medium reward. There's more exciting rookies id rather devote a bench spot too and hold throughout the season. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> By balls to the wall do you mean the 31st ranked defense in the league that year? Perry would have been fired if we didn't make the playoffs. The only reason the D came together in the playoffs is from leaders like Antrel Rolle and Justin tuck stepping up and rallying it together as a unit. We were the first playoff team that had more point against than points forward during the regular season. Eli literally had to bail us out in the 4th quarter of almost every game that year, which is what made it so exciting. But our defense was atrocious and Perry doesn't deserve that ring. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This was fundamentally a completely different offense than what had been in place for the better part of a decade. Very difficult to learn and succeed during the season, naturally going to have a lot of growing pains. If you watch the team's performance throughout the year there is a lot of evident progress, I'm excited to see what it can do next year with an improved line.

Take veteran quarterbacks in the league who are considered top of their class: Brady, Rodgers, Peyton, Brees- out of these, these players have been in the same system their entire careers (I know Peyton changed teams, but he's on another level and runs his own operation- this scheme stayed the same). If you take any of these guys and stick them in an entirely different offense schematically, there's going to be significant growing pains. And while there was a good amount of miscommunication early on in the year, Eli still put up very good numbers overall, which is reason to have higher expectations heading into next season.

Other commentators have mentioned we were beleaguered with injuries- this is true, but honestly I don't like using it as an excuse because I feel good teams can overcome that.

Giants had a lot of games this year they were competitive in until the 4th quarter when they fell apart.

Defense was completely unreliable, truly atrocious at times. Perry Fewell would have been fired in 2011 if it hadn't been for Eli bailing out the defense each week and eventually winning a Super Bowl.

Special Teams is another black eye for the Giants and has been for quite some time. Our coach, Tom Quinn, I'm convinced is someone in ownership's brother-in-law, boggles my mind the man has a job in this league.

Giants fans have a lot to be excited about going into next year. The division has some powerful teams, but it's certainly within their grasp. </TEXT>
