	<TEXT> Exactly.   

But going to 11 across the board is ridiculous.   

It doesn't mean Racism is over... but at least we can make it so our government doesn't fly racist symbols as their flag.   It makes me sick that everyone else wants to turn this whole thing into a ridiculous joke.    </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So I'm playing this complete waste of a time money stealing game SimCity BuildIt.   I'm at the level where schools became available and the people are asking for them.  But they are 40,000 and I refuse to pay real money to buy fake currency.  So I earn the money by actually playing the game.   

Needless to say, at this level, 40,000 takes a long long time to earn from crafting alone.   If I level up, Police stations will become available and they'll start begging for that AND schools.   But money is tight.  

So I finally earn enough to build the damn school.  And just before I'm about to place it I see a complaint bubble that there are no schools.   Resenting the time I just spent earning this damn school I decided to retaliate.   So I placed it in the low value shitty land in the pollution zone near the factories.  

After I did it I felt vindicated.  Take that, you selfish bastards.   And then I thought.... OH so this is why this lame shit happens IRL.  

Can we PLEASE turn our government inside out these next couple of election cycles?  If not for all you lazy dicks not voting....

Swarm the polls.  Vote out incumbents. (unless they have a verifiable record of not being a corporate hack and/or a dickhead.)  Leave the Bernies in office.  No matter what their party is, if they have a record of staying true to the people, DO NOT VOTE THEM OUT.   Keep them.  Vote out all these other rich knob polishers.      </TEXT>

Apple just removed games from their store that had the flag in it.  Nevermind if it might be a game about the civil war...............................

Mockery.... a fucking mockery is being made from the issue.   And that's how the issue gets marginalized.

	<TEXT>  What's an assault rifle going to do against a tank?  Nothing.  So instead, it gets used in a different manner that harms innocent people.  Which gives cause for the police to continue increasing arms and owning tanks.  Because we have weapons of war on the street; we need weapons of war to combat it.  It's a goddamn arms race.  And a civilian won't win an arms race.    

The national guard would just get called in anyway.  National guard is full of mouth breathing morons that would just blindly follow orders just like they did in the 1960s.  And many of them are just itching to play big time tough Active Duty Soldier Boy.   I had the unfortunate experience of working with these guys in Iraq.  Fucking morons, with their big time attitudes, thinking they were heroes; and doing stupid shit that got people hurt.    

Any revolution we have needs to be non violent.  Because our stupid little guns won't protect us.  Anyone who thinks guns can protect us from government weaponry is willfully dishonest with themselves about reality. 

And people say "oh the military wouldn't do that".   As a vet... fuck yes we would follow orders.   There would be some desertion as there is in ANY war... but ultimately even the military has an US and Them (civilians) attitude.   

These weapons don't do shit to protect us from tyranny.  Our revolutions need to be peaceful for them to work.    </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Front Line Assembly... it was in the late 80s I first heard them.  I was on a road trip to texas.  I was 10 years old.  We stopped at a gas station.  There was a spinning display of cassette tapes in the corner.   I picked up one on the back side that had a cool picture and was dusty.  

I get in the car and popped it into my walkman... it was like NOTHING anyone ever played on the radio.  It was so suspenseful the music.   I was on the edge of the seat waiting to hear what would come next.  And the beats made me want to drum on stuff.   

I was hooked.   I will enjoy everything they make... even if it's not the same now.  I don't care.  Bill Leeb, in yourself and do whatever the fuck you want. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Wow I should have sent my size in.   @ 11.5 inches.  

And this is not bragging.    There is nothing cool about having a massive cock and sex is always terrible because the depth capacity of vagina just isn't great enough.  

So, I wish I could, but never will, have the sensation of sinking in "all the way to my balls" that I keep hearing about.  Apparently the feeling is the bee's knees....I wouldn't know.

And blow jobs?   What's that? Blow jobs are so terrible when you are a longer size.  

Underwear?    Boxers or gtfo... and the tip still hangs down.   Anything with "brief" in the name is very uncomfortable.   

And sports suck because even with a J - strap  it gets in the way.  

Most girls are afraid of it, especially when i take it out on the subway.  And when I sit with slacks on, everyone hawks at my massive jiggly bits pant mold. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> He completed 2 out of 3 parts of the ritual voluntarily.  He was interrupted by V'Ger  The new Spock did not do any part of it.  He rebelled from the beginning.  

Edit: It's arguable that there are three basic emotions: Fear, Happiness, and Love. Thus, the three part ritual to remove each set of emotions. The original Spock removed fear and happiness but was left with love.  This love motivated him to do a great many illogical acts for the sake of his crew and love of a dear friend.  

New Spock, having completed zero parts of the ritual, displays his fear, unhappiness, and love quit often.  And as we know, angry/feeling vulcans are basically just Romulans.      </TEXT>

Once I refused pills I got better.  I basically had a choice between having the original condition or having a multitude of other conditions and risks.

	<TEXT> There is the argument that Germany invaded eastward because it knew the fall of the west was coming. It needed breathing room but ended up being just an extra nail in it's own coffin.  

Yes the USA did just kickass and take names.  Germany was powerful adversary.  They were already there, dug in, with defensive structures in place.   You don't chip away at that sort of situation without being a total badass.  Taking fortified territory is one of the hardest things to accomplish in warfare.   You don't do it by being a pussy... or by being unclever.  Which the USA had to be since it's equipment had to come from half a world away.   We couldn't just load up dozen C17 and C5s and airdrop or insert everything in less than 12 hours like we can today.

The logistical challenges the USA faced far exceeded that of the German army.  The tonnage of cargo and personnel movement world record, from WWII, stood until 2007-2008 when the record was broken at Balad/Anaconda in Iraq.   And it took modern cargo aircraft to accomplish that record breaking.  (armored humvees and MRAPS also weigh a good deal more than a shitty jeep)

So to imply that the USA didn't really do shit in WWII is flatly ignorant.    </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No... because some states will reject corporations money and not ratify.  The political climate in the individual states isn't so easily bought if you are asking for something they are fundamentally against.  It doesn't matter how many billions you have.

Ratification process serves us well here.  Whilst I don't think it is IMPOSSIBLE to buy the entire thing... it's not going to happen quietly.  The massive number of individuals that have to be bought here... it won't stay quiet for long.

The director would have to be someone who wouldn't hold back.  But it looks like Jim Carrey won't go that road anymore.  

The story behind 23 seems... weak. 

Edit: I would argue to Carrey that dark psychological ~~drama~~"thriller" =/= pure horror film.    </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah but their personalities are way different than each other... 

Robin Williams would play a more loathing depressed type of killer that uses the murder to soothe internal pain.  

Carrey would be a more antagonstic or playful killer just out for the sick pleasure.  with some amount of loathing to go along with it.    </TEXT>

I got to thinking if this could be made into a movie... I don't know.  It'd be a LONG fucking movie I'd think.    

Netflix series??? I'm not sure the intensity of the environment would work over tons of episodes?  If it's TOO campy it won't work I think.

"huh hhuh uh here's a stick... poke em with it huh huhuhuh. .  that's cool.  They deserve it. Commies"   

Kim Jung-Un will eventually say please.  But in a long drawn out way before he pushes the launch button.   "Puhleeaasseee"  **CLACK!**  (his launch button has a 3 foot diameter probably)

Europe just thinks if you don't look at it then it will go away.  

China is like a parent that is embarrassed by it's special needs child.    

Russia doesn't give a shit unless it makes the USA look bad then they just play blah blah blah lip service to it....  

Japan is aching to be let out of it's cage.   Until then it just gets to bolster it's "defensive force" and play the victim. (we won't talk about how their short lived conquests are what originally caused all this shit to happen.  NEW FLAG; DIDN'T HAPPEN TEEHEE! )  

The USA just likes to punch shit; so that didn't really heal any of the wounds that Old Japan left behind.   

When shit finally hits the fan with this stupid ass nonsense, everyone is going to wish we had done something different.  Because it's gonna be messy for South Korea and the rest of Asia; as USA and China can't play nice on the water.    </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes... based on the studies... IN GENERAL organics are loaded with parasites when compared to non organics.  

For example,  2 buckets of produce.  Organic and Non Organic.   If the organic has as much as 31% more parasites than the non organic then it was taken on a load of parasites.   LOL    


I stand by that.

	<TEXT> This is true.  You should wash everything.  

However, the studies were comparing organics to non organics.  Whole Foods is an organic grocery, no? 

It is fair to note, that my opening sentence was "Wash your veggies" but then spoke specifically to the type of organic product of Whole Foods and how you should be MORE vigilant.  Perhaps wash those organic veggies extra due to the increased risk.   

I mean... feel free to simplify an entire post, to a single, out of context quote....

	<TEXT> This is true but rabbits also have a hard time drinking liquid water.  They get much of their mosture off the dew covering the grasses they eat.   

So grapes aren't a good thing to feed everyday, They are probably perfect for a lost and probably hungry and dehydrated rabbit.   It's just okay for a first feeding to give it some needed sugars and water.  I would suggest taking the skin off the grapes if the rabbit isn't spitting them out.      

But after some rest you should give it something better suited to it's daily nutritional needs.

	<TEXT> Upon confronting the victim, one must convince them to sit completely still so that the victim can present a precise location of an area no larger than 1/4 an inch.  The attacker will carefully line up the attack utilizing only their index and middle fingers to jam swiftly, forcefully, and deeply into an area penetrating the area between the  pyramid and the inferior cerebellar peduncle.  


If the victim tenses up and this area cannot be punctured the attacker will then say "Wait" and try again.  If continued flinching persists in disrupting a precise hit the attacker can eventually tell the victim to "hang on 1 sec" whilst they pull out their knife and just access the nerve through the jugular foramen or possibly through the carotid sheath were it lies between the internal carotid artery and the internal jugular vein.  

The attacker must be careful not to nick either of these blood transporting structures, as doing so might cause imminent death; thereby interfering with the process of achieving death by disruption of the bundled pair of vagus nerves.    </TEXT>

Fuck yes is the answer to that.  USPS transit times comparable to fedex and UPS slowest cheapest way but yet still costs less money.

How about all the crime that Native Americans commit against other Native Americans.... do you hate all native americans right now?  Or is his crime against his own race still really the fault of whites?  

What about the chinese railroad workers that used to murder the native american competition in their sleep?  Do you hate chinese now?   Will you cut one of them if they walk onto a reservation?   What about a mexican?  Mexicans are half white and half native in general.   Would you cut a mexican?  He's half to blame! 


Apparently being full of shit applies to ANY race. 


And I got news for you, the native americans were waring, brutalizing, enslaving, murdering, raping, scalping, raiding, and eating each other LONG LONG before whites ever got here.  I suppose you think they were really all just sitting around in their teepee's smoking peacepipes and playing flutes huh?   They never ever fought or attacked others. *cough PAWNEE cough*   Oh and the Comanche tribe used to hunt down other tribes, kill their babies over a fire and then eat their cooked flesh.

I'm sorry, but I don't take blame for the failings of dead people who died hundreds of years before I was born.  My european family line wasn't even in the USA at that time.  (oh and my great grandmother was full cherokee).  Which doesn't mean shit because i'm mostly white.  So much so you can't tell there is any native american genes in my dna.     

So does that mean I get like 75% blame and get to claim 25% victim?  (or whatever the percentage is for that generational spread)

	<TEXT> I was white in New Orleans inner city school before moving to Atlanta.  

In New Orleans school, there was no separation of students at lunch.  I was a minority and had nicknames like "whitey" "white bread" and "saltine".   I didn't really care because it was in good fun and these were my friends.  Friends that had my back and I had their's.  Which was damn important in New Orleans.  The other whites just sat mixed in with the blacks.  Salt and Pepper.  1 to 5 ratio if I had to guess. 


Then, I moved to Atlanta.  My first day at school, I get lunch and I sit down at the nearest open seat.  I had not yet noticed that all the students were divided.  White kids on one side and the black kids on the other.   

Anyway.  I sat down at what happened to be the blacks table.   Well the black kids started harassing me, pushing me out of my chair, and told me to get back over to the side of the cafeteria; where "my kind" were to sit.   


Now I didn't know what the fuck was going on.   At all.  Goddamn mars this fucking place.  Then I noticed the division.  Having no allies on my first day, naturally I retreat to the white kids' side of the cafeteria; where I had been unanimously told to go, by a large group of very upset students.   And I wasn't accepted there, with the whites, either.  The kids then called me a "wigger" and nicknamed me "white men can't jump" as that movie was popular at the time. White men can't jump was my name for the next 3 years before I moved again.   That was, by far, the dumbest 3 years of my entire existence.  Fuck Atlanta.  Honestly FUCK Atlanta.  

I'm not saying anything at all about this story in relation to the struggle of racism in the USA.  I'm not sure what it means, to be honest.  I'm not going to deny that I would not want the challenges a black man continues to face today.  I do my best not to compound the problems, that other races have, by simply treating them how I would want to be treated.  It's their own fault if they are dicks after that.  And being a dick has nothing to do with skin. 

I've been all over the world and I'll tell you this: People are people and they are generally the same everywhere you go. And one thing that always seems to stay true, no matter where I am in the world, is that a vocal and powerful shitty few fuck everything up for the silent majority.   

 I've never really formed an opinion other than this was an unfortunate situation.   And it taught me to have an open mind... but to also have open eyes to go along with that open mind.

	<TEXT> I agree.   It was something that I saw them talking about on the "news" here in Phillipines... Which is just opinion blabbing just like USA news.   

They were talking about bringing Netflix to the Philippines and discussing how they could possibly make a subscription service work in a poor cash driven society.   The subject of ads came up.   So I asked here wondering what Americans thought.  I suspected it would be against it but I wanted to see if anyone would bring up the "revenue generation" arguments or "incentivizing production of more shows" that was getting thrown around during the segment.     

On a side note: I like how many people are participating and then downvoting the question.   Isn't the vote not supposed to be about agreement or disagreement?   Geeze people, Sorry it's not a *Plumbers of reddit, whats the biggest turd you wrangled at your job* question. </TEXT>
