	<TEXT> I very strongly disagree with this:

 its going to cause youths to smoke it more since its been legitimized by the government.

Besides the fact that that's a pretty illogical statement (legalization might lessen the stigma, but it certainly won't *cause* anyone to use), the reverse will undoubtedly be true. Weed, at the moment, is essentially entirely unregulated, and many kids choose weed over beer because it's easier to get.

CVS isn't going to sell to a minor, but dealers have zero problem with it. Make pot legal and you get rid of most of the dealers. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> First sentence:

Following comments Donald Trump made about Mexican immigrants during his presidential announcement last week,

There's also this:

"When do we beat Mexico at the border?" Trump said during his lengthy presidential announcement speech at Trump Tower in New York. "They're sending people that have lots of problems, and they're bringing those problems with us. They're bringing drugs, they're bringing crime. They're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people."

And this:

Trump's comments are just the type the Republican Party has been looking to avoid. The Republican National Committee underwent serious self-reflection following President Obama's re-election, initiating an "autopsy" of what went wrong. It determined it had to reach out to minorities to strike a more inclusive tone.

And this:

The controversy seems unlikely to fade, especially now that Trump is an official candidate for president. With his high name recognition, he places highly in many polls and is likely to be included in the first two Republican presidential debates scheduled for August.

This entire article is about a US presidential candidate making several highly offensive comments during his announcement that he is running for president, and a major media corporation severing ties due to the nature of those comments, as well as the impact that it has on said candidate's party.

How is that not about current American politics? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> And surviving teammates, please, PLEASE act as though you're down a hero. Because you are. I can't tell you how many times I've seen a teammate die, followed by one of my other teammates starting (yes, starting) a team fight with the 5 enemies that just got the kill.

Repeat after me:

By Grapthar's Hammer, you shall be amazed at how I wisely fall back and safely soak/defend by (preferably behind) our towers until our team is no longer at a significant disadvantage!

Of course you can't just give the enemy full map control every time one of your teammates goes down, but you do have to acknowledge their advantage and play accordingly. If the enemy is up 2-3 heroes, they're going to take a boss, your mercs, a fort, etc.. That's their reward, let them have it, and don't add to it if you can't deny them safely and sensibly.

TL;DR - Don't get dead, too. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Then if you don't mind a suggestion, stop saying that it won't happen. If you're right, then it won't have changed anything, but by trying to declare defeat for him early, all you're really doing is making it more likely. There's no upside to it.

He's got quite an uphill battle, and one of the major hurtles is the fact that everyone keeps saying that he can't win, because everyone keeps saying that he can't win. It's really amazing how much progress that he's making, and at how fast he's closing the gap, given the fact that even his own supporters are trying to convince everyone that he won't win.

Let the guy win. </TEXT>

You'd think they'd be against a frivolous law that arbitrarily increases the number of criminals and arrests (and thus potentially violent confrontations).

I would like to see the persistent range check removed. If I am in range to start it up, barring a hearth it should go off.

TL;DR I love Tyrael. Let me love him more.

	<TEXT> It's not even Christianity. It's a couple lines in the old testament.

100% guarantee Jesus would support gay rights today. He was incredibly liberal and accepting, based on everything that he says in The Bible. He'd be pretty appalled that ignorant and intolerant people use His name to discriminate against others.

I really don't get why the right is considered the party of Christianity, other than the fact that they try and legislate out of the bible (the limited parts of it that they key in on). Their platform of greed, intolerance, judgement, and hate is pretty counter to everything that Jesus said and stood for. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Crossing my fingers for a Starcraft themed map and heroes.

Yeah, thought about saying something like that in my post, but didn't want to push our luck :P. I think the Diablo characters are the coolest and most interesting, but Starcraft is definitely my favorite of the three universes, and I'd love to see more protoss and zerg enter the mix, especially a zealot. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I just think if I use the ability within range, it should fire The way it is now it seems like this is the flow:

1. Check if target is in range.
2. Dismount, stop moving, and say "Embrace Judgement".
3. Check if target is in range.
4. Fire.

If the target was in range when I cast it, the ability should fire. Otherwise, the ability's max range is effectively lower than it appears. It sucks having to get closer than max range to actually use the ability.

Really the other issue is the bigger one, though. Countless times (including twice yesterday) I'll click on one enemy and Tyrael will charge another. Drives me nuts, especially because it's often a full health warrior that gets hit instead of the 10% health assassin that I clicked on.

EDIT: Also, your username is cool and very Rehgarish. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  There will fewer options because people at the bottom won't challenge the people above them.

This is the part that I really disagree with. $12,000 per year isn't going to disincentive anyone. Nobody's ambition ends with "not starving". I really think you'll see a large productivity increase, because people will be doing the work that they choose, not that they need to survive.

Really, though, at the end of the day, the most compelling reason for basic income is the fact that automation and efficiency are crushing jobs, and will continue to do so at an accelerated rate. They're going to increase the already growing wealth gap, and we're simply not going to have enough jobs for people. Moreover, with 99% of all new wealth headed straight to the 1%, we're going to find that it would be in everyone's best interest (the ultra rich included) for that money to circulate, rather than to accumulate. Basic income solves both of those problems. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Drives me crazy when a tribute is announced near the bottom, and top lane sits there for 30 seconds and THEN comes down. Even if you get there exactly as the fight starts (which is unlikely), you've put your team at a significant disadvantage, as the enemy has had the chance to position themselves favorably. Chances are, though, if you're coming that late that at least one of your teammates will be dead by the time you get there.

Be where the fight is, and please, get there early. </TEXT>

The government is guaranteeing that, no matter the circumstances, every one of its citizens has enough to ensure their basic needs of survival.

	<TEXT> Almost nobody would stop working. Many would do different things, but very few people would be content to live on $12,000 per year. The poor, especially, would continue working, as they've got more incentive to do so (since they're, well, poor).

Personally i expect Americans to just pocket the money and make more money.

Yup. That's the idea. Though with the added buffer and safety net, they're be more likely to seek out work that they enjoy or are more suited towards. Some might even drop down to part time to spend more time on their families, or doing things that they find valuable, but might not be all that profitable (charity, art, community development, etc.). </TEXT>
