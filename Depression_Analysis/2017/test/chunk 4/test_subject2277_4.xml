	<TEXT> For arguments sake;

I have a childhood friend, I am 40 now, who I have lost touch with the last 3 or 4 years.

If he died tomorrow, how could I possibly prove that I was friends with him? I do not have a single photograph of him and I together.

Never even met an American police officer.

	<TEXT> Some kids cause tremendous disruption, conflict and stress in the home, despite having caring parents who have other children who are well behaved.

If they will not respect the rules of the home, set them free.

Some parents are horrible.

Yes, sometimes that is the difficult, but necessary action.

No.

Call the cunts out for their cunt behavior and stop telling the targets of their collective disdain that it's not a problem?

Yes. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It was absolutely not worse.  Commonly visited websites, unlike commonly visited websites of today, (twitter, Reddit, Facebook,) were not chalk full of poisonous vitriol, anger and insult as they are today.

He took her down too hard I think.
I also don't believe she should have kicked him. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If I'm 15 and hundreds of people are collectively mocking me, both strangers and my peers and it's spilling over into school...

That shit's gotta hurt something fierce.

I'm 40 and when I was 15, there was no such thing as people posting a picture of you online and saying horrible shit about your looks and some telling you to kill yourself.

It just wasn't a thing...

And then you say it's the kid being mocked who has the problem and not the vicious people finding pleasure in tearing someone down? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It wasn't always this way.   Seriously, Ive been online since 94. ( interesting you chose that year)

Things have changed and in cases related to disagreement, not for the better.  

You can't disagree with popular sentiment on Reddit, else you'll be insulted, ridiculed and cursed at.

It's pretty strange, as people don't act like that in real life. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 16 is the age a youth can be kicked out.

You don't believe that there are youths who are so destructive, so abusive, so disruptive and so intent on disrespecting the rules of the home that a parent is not wise to give their child the freedom they so desire by taking away the privilege of living rent free in the home?

I do believe there are unfortunately youths who do in fact deserve to be removed from their homes due to the choices they make and their behaviors.
