this dude shot 16 ppl. not trying to compare bad apples to bad apples but i don't think there is any special treatment going on. just look at all that white privilege.

***It breaks rule 1:*** **Use the correct title formatting.** Titles should be to the point, and all extra information or context should be added in the comments. 

Here is how you should format it - 

* If it's your work - 'Title, medium, size'. If you are posting another artist's work then title it, 'Title, Artist, Year'. 


Also remember no extraneous information in the title means do not state that it's your first time using a medium in the title, or write 'Hey Reddit', 'What do you think?' 'A ____ I did' or any variation or be subjective in the title ("awesome work," "amazing piece" etc). Also do not mention your 'cake day' or use karma-bait titles.

***It breaks rule 1:*** **Use the correct title formatting.** Titles should be to the point, and all extra information or context should be added in the comments. 

Here is how you should format it - 

Your artwork - "Title, Medium, Size" 


Also remember no extraneous information in the title means do not state that it's your first time using a medium in the title, or write 'Hey Reddit', 'What do you think?' 'A ____ I did' or any variation or be subjective in the title ("awesome work," "amazing piece" etc). Also do not mention your 'cake day' or use karma-bait titles.

  There's no excuse for you to have missed it.

accidents happen, things get overlooked. i did scroll the front page but i didn't see it. 

edit: i love a good cutaway, you can't fault me for that

double edit: i remove reposts all the time in /r/art. but i don't get bent out of shape about it.  </TEXT>
