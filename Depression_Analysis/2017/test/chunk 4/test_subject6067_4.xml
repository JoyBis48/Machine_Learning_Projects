	<TEXT> I use a bit of twitter to get the word out.  My little blog also has lots of photos so sometimes the restaurants or stores use them on their Facebook pages.  I get a good boost in traffic when that has happened.

	<TEXT> Maybe you could rub some sugar+olive oil+honey on your lips and let it soak in.  Then after rinsing off with warm water you could use a natural lip balm (non medicated, just simple oil+beeswax type) and try to stop licking your lips.  I know that when I get wind chapped lips I tend to lick it a lot ... which makes it worst. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not really sure.. maybe a total of 20-30 minutes?  As soon as we got off the Bart, walked up the stairs, and we saw a line that was already formed outside on the corner.  Someone was there at a table selling round trip tickets.  The shuttle arrived after 10 minutes of waiting and the ride was 15-20 minutes.  Make sure you only use clear bags or gallon ziplocks.  We totally forgot about it, but good thing my purse was pretty small :D  Have a great time if you decide to go! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi guys!  We are here for a 49ers game tomorrow and staying in Hayward.  I would love some help on figuring out how to get there.  We want to take the Bart but not sure which exit to get off.  I've also read that it's not really walkable from the Bart station to candlestick.  Any help would be greatly appreciated! Thank you. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I LOLed at the Venus fly trap comment.. ahahahah.  I killed 20 BSF adults yesterday and there hasn't been anymore today, so hopefully it's over.  I was thinking maybe they're trying to come inside since the AC is on and it's 100 degrees outside.  I haven't looked in the bin in 2 weeks cause I've been scared.  Later on today I'm planning on going outside with the vacuum hose and suck up any BSF adults I see in the bin.  Wish me luck.  eeeek </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So I've been trying to starve my bin a bit and today I've started to see Black Soldier Fly adults inside my house!  ACK!  Is there a reason why they would want to come into the house?  We don't have any rotting food, our back door hasn't been opened, but I still see them gathering around the window closest to the door.  Could they be crawling in from around the door? Why are they in the house? AHHh help please lol.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's why I've left it that way for this long.  The thing that does bother me is it runs on with my posts titles.  For example, if a title of a page is "my first post" it looks like " My first posttest_subject6067.com" . Should I just leave a space after my titles or add a space in front of sitename .  I don't even know if that would work!  </TEXT>
