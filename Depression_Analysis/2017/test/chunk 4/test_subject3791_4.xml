	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT>  We have been made aware of an issue where the displays on a limited number of Lumia 930 units are exhibiting discolourations. This phenomenon is due to the performance of the display in certain brightness conditions. However, **we have identified the root cause** **and are currently working on a software update that will deliver improvements.**

	<TEXT> From what i understand, there are two similar problems: the one is a purple tint that occurs even on black menus (i don't have this, and i think that this is software related and already fixed). The other one is mine, with gradient on white/gray backgrounds, and i believe that it's hardware related (purple tint AMOLED are a common defect. Had similar problems with my Galaxy Nexus).

What country does your 930 originates from? I have installed another firmware (from Finland) in order to get the Denim, but that didn't fix it. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hello. I decided to pass the [speaker "problem"](https://www.reddit.com/r/windowsphone/comments/2o91qy/lumia_930_speaker_problem/) on my Lumia 930, but now i'm observing something else, which was there from the beginning:

When i scroll through the app list or some other list (marketplace apps, settings menus and also Internet Explorer) there seems to be an instant "jump" when i pull my finger from the screen, which moves me further down (or up, depending on the direction i was scrolling) a bit on that list.

This doesn't happen every time and sometimes it needs a lot of trying to reproduce it. It's more evident on apps list and settings menu. I can't reproduce it on apps like Here maps, Nextgen Reader, Zedge, Lastpass, Fresh Paint, when viewing a photo or on some touch screen tests.

I disabled double tap to wake and to zoom and set screen sensitivity to normal, but that doesn't help. It seems like a Windows Phone problem rather that hardware.

Ideas? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Lumia 930 speaker problem </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-12-04 12:09:09 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hello. I bought a new Lumia 930. So far, i'm quite impressed with the phone. The only drawbacks seems to be the battery (which could have been better) and the speaker on the back.

The speaker is my main concern for now.  The problem is that, after every sound, it makes a bearably noticeable hiss for 4-5 sec and then (with most sounds) a click/pop (which, in a relatively quite environment, is quite obvious). That hiss is there even on apps like Nokia Camera, continuously. Also, on some notification sounds, there are 2-3 clicks just before the end (but can't hear them on music or other sounds).

I have found many references to this problem (px [here](http://forums.windowscentral.com/nokia-lumia-930/322329-nokia-930-speaker-hiss.html)) but no solution, workaround or someone that gave his device for service and they fix it. Many people say that it's a known problem with Lumia's, and it's something that occurred after WP 8/8.1 (and i have the latest updates).

My Lumia is eligible for DOA, but it's something that will take 10-15 days, since the store has to send the device to the authorized service in order to certify that it needs replacement - yes, i know, shitty service. I'm from Greece.

So, i was wondering: is this a hardware or a software problem? Is it a problem (so they are going to replace my device) or i'll spend 15 days with no smartphone just to get another one (or just the same) that has the same problem?

Thanks in advance!

	<TEXT> Quick question for the owners of the Lumia 930: what do you think about the viewing angles of the screen? I saw on a video review (i think it was from Phonedog) that colors tend to fade easily, from very small angles. Is it true? Is that screen that bad?

 i went to 2-3 big local stores and i couldn't find a Lumia 930 to examine it myself. In truth, there were very few to none Lumia (they tend to promote Samsung and Apple).

	<TEXT> There are many apps that i'm counting on in Android, but i don't think there's anything that i'm not able to find an alternative for in WP right now. I'm not closed mind or a fanboy of any company or OS and Windows Phone is definitively a choice for me.

My price ceiling is definitely around ~200 euros. it's the specs that matters for me right now. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's it's price here in Greece too. And yes, 735 is something i'm considering. Problem is that, if i finally manage to spend 200 euros, i'm not really sure if i want to get a Lumia 735 or go with Android and a Moto G 2nd gen (same price).

Windows Phone is a great choice for me for low-cost smartphones 100-150 euros), but i'm not really sure for something more pricey. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not considering 520 that much, just as a super-budget option for now, in case i decide to go with something extra cheap for now and get something better in 5-6 months.

I'm more between Lumia 535, 635 and 735. Lumia 535 has the downside of "coming soon" in Greece (don't really know how soon) and i need to get a smartphone in the coming week. And Lumia 735 is a little costly for me (200 euros), i don't know if it worths it. </TEXT>

From Oliver Stone's golden era. Having recently watched **Born on the fourth of July**, i really miss that Oliver Stone. Going to watch **Nixon** in the next few days.

My second favorite movie of this week must be **Remains of the day**.

Yes, during the last weeks, i'm in the mood of watching old (or very old) movies that - for one reason or another - haven't watch until now. I have really missed some gems. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Gaming is getting too much fantasy based (guess that's what sells more to a Lord of the rings/harry potter generation), but I'm not a fan of fighting dragons and warriors on the latest massively multiplayer RPG. So, I'm interested on your best picks of pc games that have a real world story, characters and setup (even if they get to extraordinary levels, like grand theft auto).

Thanks! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> To clear it up, [here is the full text](http://www.ted.com/talks/gary_kovacs_tracking_the_trackers/transcript?language=en#t-343768) from the TED talk:

 Privacy is not an option, and it shouldn't be the price we accept for just getting on the Internet. Our voices matter and our actions matter even more. Today we've launched Collusion. You can download it, install it in Firefox, to see who is tracking you across the Web and following you through the digital woods. Going forward, all of our voices need to be heard. Because what we don't know can actually hurt us. Because the memory of the Internet is forever. We are being watched. It's now time for us to watch the watchers.

Nick Bradbury [said something similar](http://nick.typepad.com/blog/2012/03/girls-around-me-shows-why-privacy-shouldnt-be-an-option.html). As he explains:

 Privacy - like security - **should be expected, not something that users have to enable**.

In other words, privacy must **be a de facto thing**, not something you have to choose/enable/look for. It's not an option, it's a right, it's a fact. It's like peace, health etc. </TEXT>
