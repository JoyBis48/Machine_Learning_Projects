	<TEXT> Hi Scott. First, thanks for writing. It sounds lame and cliched but reading Crapalachia this year was sort of life changing for me, it made me realize what was really important and what wasn't, so thanks. I've since picked up Collected Works, Hill William, and Stories V, all have been great. But enough gushing...

When are you looking to put out the Sarah Book (or whatever your next project may be)?

What have you read released in the past 10 years that really blew you away?

Any planned collaborations with Juliet? I enjoyed the three part piece on htmlgiant.

Thanks again </TEXT>

	<TEXT> And so is saying that players who have reached legend are the best of the best. You and I both know there are many different systems that could be used to more accurately gauge player skill than this current system, but the reasons it's used are pretty obvious - it's much more friendly to bad players, and incentivizes playing as much as possible. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sure, every multiplayer game is like this, but only because the devs prefer a model where to be the best at their game, you need to only play their game and nothing else.  To claim that legend rank equates to being "best of the best" is disingenuous. If Blizzard actually wanted a ranking system where the best players are at the top, they'd use some modification of ELO, not their current model, which boils down to being slightly better than a 50% win rate and playing a ton of games. </TEXT>

I've had it happen to me twice today, (person stops playing around 16 min when it's clear they've lost, miraculously regain their connection with 1 minute left)  which equates to about 30 minutes of me blindly staring at my screen, doing nothing.

Luckily I'm at work with nothing better to do, but come on, is it so unreasonable to put in a five minute inactivity auto loss? If you're taking longer than five minutes to take a turn, it isn't due to you playing on mobile, it's due to you being a child and trying to scum wins.

It ruins things for people who actually have to walk away for a few minutes, but if you're constantly making your opponent wait 5+ minutes you're being incredibly rude anyways. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not really concerned with the programming. If you play a consistent card in PL1, you are guaranteed to draw it in PL2? Does that mean if you play a level 1 consistent card in PL4 you're guaranteed to draw it in PL5? Does it still work if you metatransfer/synapsis oracle or do something similar to level it? Does the consistent do anything at lvl 3? etc </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In PL1 I hardly ever want to play 6+ power guys, minus a few exceptions like swampmoss lurker, nexus pilot, glutton, etc. I love drafting cards like the Uterra 7/8, but I only play it in PL1 if I'm forced to, even without a WWP in my deck.

Factor in that you're probably playing with things that leave small bodies around (especially in U/N, arguably the best draft archetype) and WWP is just consistently an all star. Still not better than strategist/battletech, but probably third best heroic. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You are right, the two-ofs are not crucial at all, and are the replaceable cards. 

Reveler is basically "hope i draw it in a favorable 1.4 situation". Will win some games outright now and then but I definitely wouldn't fault anyone for cutting them for a 3rd phoenix.

Phoenix is a great card, but I feel like it doesnt synergize very well with the deck. I like to drop him if I don't know what I'm playing in phase 1, good underdrop, sometimes 2.4 pays off if your opp is still alive, but overall not crucial to the deck

uranti bolt I don't think I really ever cast it, could easily be cut, but gives you various removal options i guess

I just don't think there are many better cards. I would rather play all of these over firefist uranti, warbringer uranti, etc.

	<TEXT> The playdek app already exists. The promised new version would provide tournaments, campaign mode, and was generally made out to be a more robust version of the existing client, with possible future developments like creating a custom ascension cube.

What exactly do backers get out of this now? The same iphone client most of them likely already have? Promo cards they've already bought?

It's great to see Playdek continuing development as IOS ascension is great, but as a backer, where did the money you pledged actually go? Certainly not to where you thought it was going, but hey, you still get your backer reward t-shirt. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Annihilation was very good, I thought. I was a little underwhelmed with Authority - the pacing is pretty slow, and most of the first half of the book felt like it was just "remember all of the cool creepy stuff that happened in the first book?" Wasn't a huge fan of the convenient ending either, but the book had its moments, like [Spoiler](/s "the mural") which were really great.

Still very much looking forward to the last book. Vandermeer has other great books as well. Check out The Third Bear, it's an excellent collection of short stories and my personal favorite of his. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Rather than saying "Wow, OP", why not try to add some actual discussion to the card? I do not think this card is very strong. It's a mediocre card. Visions of drawing 2 Antonidases, Rags, etc, are flowing through everyone's heads, And maybe if a control mage type deck becomes playable, this card could be a strong lategame piece.


For draft? It's pretty bad, worse than arcane intellect in my opinion. Every competent draft player plays around secrets already, so this card clashes hard with a lot of cards - hex, imp master, razorfen hunter, harvest golem token, silverhand recruit, violet teacher, etc. 


You will of course get some nice value some of the time, but most times, the card is going to be way harder to successfully pull off than you think, especially in draft.
