	<TEXT> We have a new priest this year, and he uses incence.  I am a convert, and have never dealt with it.

After blessing the consecration, he turns to the congregation, bows, blesses each side, and bows again.

My question: Do I bow the first time; as he blesses me; or the last bow?  Do I make the sign of the cross?  Do I do nothing?

I'm so confused, and it appears the majority of the congregation is as well based upon their responses.  Haha! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'll stick with Spotify.  Tidal is sponsored/backed by several artists I can't stand.  It also REQUIRES a "30-day" trial (i.e., there is no free service with commercials).  I'm not giving you my credit card number to get a 30-day trial.  Screw you. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Whether the jump was "illegal" or not, I'm glad the umpire called him safe for one reason:

Someone tossed the loose ball back to the catcher instead of making him scramble for it.  The runner probably would've been safe otherwise. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I loved these shorts!  They were some of my favorites.

There was also a counting short that used colored sand to create an African vibe.  The background singing was something like, "uh-DOONG-a-ding-a-ding; uh-DOONG-a-ding-a-ding..."

For the life of me, I can NOT find that video anywhere... or find someone who remembers it. </TEXT>
