 Ultimately, The Joker arguably carries the whole thing off just to prove how clever he is, but its difficult to claim youre an agent of chaos when you put quite that much work into making sure that absolutely everything goes your way  even if its never entirely quite clear exactly what your way is.

The Joker has historically been a criminal mastermind who revels in the chaos he causes around him.  I dont see how that has anything to do with the fact that he has multi-leveled formulated plans. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Some outstanding points:

1. we dont know anything about the video encoding/bitrates you are trying to playback.
2. we dont know anything about the throughput from your NAS.
3. You say the videos dont playback, and so you "invariably rip a higher bitrate version"?

Some things to do:

1. Get file transfer stats to/from your NAS.  On windows, this is a very small/convenient tool:  http://www.totusoft.com/lanspeed1.html
2. Test against another Plex client.

Some additional things to check out:

	<TEXT> Does this happen with direct play or transcoding?  I have a Samsung UN60H6350 (quad-core), and I am able to playback highly-encoded videos just fine - but saying that in a non-technical manner is kind of meaningless.  Specs are what will tell you if something is a yay or nay in terms of compatibility.

Can you give us any additional details about the encoding of the videos?  Are you making them yourself?  Perhaps you can re-encode in a manner that is more compatible with your specific TVs decoding capabilities.

As an example, I can easily direct-play across a 802.11g WLAN from a c2007 Sony VAIO Core 2 Duo - and that thing is an outdated piece of crap.  I can transcode too, but it beats the hell out of the processor (100% pegged).   If having to transcode from it, I run scripts to stop all sorts of things from running on it (tasks and services) to drop it to the greatest amount of processor availability I can.

I honestly think your problem is with the coding of the videos specifically.  Something is probably out of spec there. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You need to get the carpet properly tested to show/prove allergens.  Otherwise, what you are saying is just lip-service.  Document the bedbugs as well, and show them the documentation - *dont just talk about it*.   They should be highly motivated about the bedbugs because of the risk of infestation and spreading.  The allergens as a proved health risk should also motivate them.

You can then use that same documentation against them if you decide to escalate the matter. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks for your reply.

No cropping on my part - whats shown is the full extent of the image (it was a still image, not a moving image).

Its from one of the Evangelion "rebuild" movies, and is an image that is shown very briefly during some dramatic dialog, so I cant help but wonder if there is some hidden meaning/text that goes beyond simply "crew room" or "crew compartment".

I wonder that sometimes a word or two in Japanese means one thing, but has similar pronunciations that mean something else that is more devious. </TEXT>

This is a *front* address for many various "companies" that you can find online.  I'm not saying this un-legitimizes BiteSMS, but IMHO its sketchy for a legit company to share a mailing address.

I loved their product, I paid for their product, and I miss it.  But I dunno to what extent I would call them a "legit company" outside of a couple of devs. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In a long tracked shot like this, the cuts are always when a head is turned just as a speedup takes place or just took place to take advantage of motion blurring.  Thats when you have stunt actors swapped in/out and or simply have different takes combined.  

The sequence looks awesome, but this is not a single take.  Its tracked, and is a composite. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This has been a long-standing unaddressed complaint on the XBMC side for years.  The best thing we accomplished on XBMC was individual audio settings per-video.   Meaning that per-video, you could set audio increase/decrease settings to normalize the title to your default audio settings.  Its a bit annoying, but it gets the job done and you only have to tweak the problematic titles. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't take that as a joke.  Its a common correlation that is noticed during the spring.

Although there are many months that are recorded to have nearly the same crime statistics year-round, many graphs show a dip in crime during the coldest months of winter (about 2 months worth) which then slowly build through the spring and then plateau until the next deep winter drop. </TEXT>
