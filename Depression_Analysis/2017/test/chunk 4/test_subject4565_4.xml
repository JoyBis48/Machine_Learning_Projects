	<TEXT> I live in Pennsylvania, an at-will employment state. It has been my impression that even though we have the right to fire an employee for any reason at any time, or for no reason at all, the employer would still be liable for paying the unemployment costs associated with that fired employee should he/she apply and be approved due to accumulating enough previous work credits with said employer.

Where as if the employee in question is fired due to negligence on their part, the employer would not be liable for such a claim.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The Buzzer. Most agree that it's Russian military, most likely used to communicate with their spies in other countries, by sending coded messages which can be deciphered through the use of a one-time number pad. Could possibly also be related to troop and/or nuclear arsenal movement etc. 

If this topic interests you, be sure to check out /r/numberstations.

Here is an interesting excerpt from the wiki article:

**Unusual transmissions**

"Frequently, distant conversations and other background noises have been heard behind the buzzer, suggesting that the buzzing tones are not generated internally, but are transmitted from a device placed behind a live and constantly open microphone. It is also possible that a microphone may have been turned on accidentally.[17] One such occasion was on November 3, 2001, when a conversation in Russian was heard:[4]

"  143.   ." "    ." ("I am 143. Not receiving the generator (oscillator)." "That stuff comes from hardware room.").[18]

On November 11, 2010, intermittent phone conversations were transmitted and were recorded by a listener (at 1400 UTC) for a period of approximately 30 minutes. These conversations are available online, and seem to be in Russian.[19][20] The phone calls mentioned the "brigade operative officer on duty", the communication nodes "Debut", "Nadezhda" (Russian for "hope", both a noun and a female name), "Sudak" (a kind of river fish and also a town in Crimea) and "Vulkan" (volcano). The female voice says "officer on duty of communication node Debut senior ensign Uspenskaya, got the control call from Nadezhda OK"." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's not that I feel personally inconvenienced, although it is certainly a rights issue. I have been able to smoke freely for 10+ years without catching any court cases. It's the general empathy I share with other people who *are* caught up in the system and those who are having their lives ruined by these unjust and unethical laws and policies. 

It is my belief that they're coming down so hard on this woman, not really because of the cannabis oil possession, but because she was successful at *treating her cancer* with the procedure. You would think a cure or effective treatment process for cancer would be heralded. Instead, she is aimed to be locked up and made an example of because there is no profit to be made from marijuana being that it can be easily cultivated by anyone.  </TEXT>

This is the first juice i have tried with a taste so seamlessly integrated to the flavor they are attempting to emulate.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ok, yes, you are correct. I can feel my heart rate and digestion rate increasing. Both of these are loosely correlated with metabolic rate. So while I guess I cannot directly feel my 'metabolic rate' increasing, I can feel the processes that are positively correlated with said metabolic rate.  </TEXT>

Even beyond differences in population, at this point in time, we really dont know why metabolic effects are occurring from cannabis use. Researchers have postulated that the interaction between the endocannabinoid system and the bodys metabolism occurs through partial antagonism of CB1 receptors in the brain. This speculation stems from trials in which Rimonabant and other CB1 receptor antagonists have been shown to reduce body mass.

In the study current marijuana use was associated with 16% lower fasting insulin levels. How does this help with metabolism? Too much insulin leads to weight gain by storing fat. So by lowering your insulin levels you minimize the weight gain. Want another reason to justify your marijuana consumption? Chronically elevated insulin levels often lead to insulin resistance, diabetes and heart disease. So get those insulin levels down!! 

The study also notes a significant association with marijuana use and smaller waist circumference. So how is it that marijuana helps your metabolism when marijuana users have higher average caloric intake levels than nonusers. Well the mechanism is not quite understood yet but our guess is that It helps you process sugars in a more efficient way, thus lowering insulin levels, thus minimizing the amount of sugars that are stored and converted to fat in your cells.

Basically, you are mostly correct, the direct effect on metabolism is minimal, however the mechanisms are not currently completely understood. While this is not a scientific source, being a long term smoker, I can actually *feel* my metabolic rate increasing after I smoke. I am willing to bet that once further detailed studies are carried out, a true correlation between marijuana and metabolic rate increase will be discovered/announced.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Of course. I was mainly curious as to why he chose "wooden" spoon. It seems to stick out when we're talking about a place that is traditionally hot and fiery. He could have just as easily have said "small metallic spoon" or "small golden spoon" and achieved a similar effect. Just curious as to why the prompt writer himself chose to go with wood.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  That would only make sense if he didn't use the plural "prompts" in his comment or say "95% of the time", meaning 95/100 prompts. There is no doubt that he's referring to a group of prompts rather than this particular prompt.

You are correct, he is referring to prompt(s) plural. However, by responding to my comment concerning the hate in THIS thread and concerning THIS particular story, it seems as if he is lumping THIS specific post in with the other 95% that are considered leading. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Huh? My original comment was speaking on the Writing Prompts hate in this thread, and talks about this specific post in general. His response was "The biggest objection is how leading the prompts are". It is only logical that he is chalking said hate up to this specific prompt being leading.

	<TEXT> Not disagreeing with the efficiency of nuclear energy. I was comparing renewable energy to fossil fuel energy. Just as there is a hard limit on how much power you can generate from a finite area, there is also a hard limit of how much oil you can suck out of a given oil field. 

The fact is that it shouldn't matter how much paper money it costs to make something happen when were talking about ending the irreparable harm we've been causing to the Earth (the one and only planet we live on) by drilling, spilling, and burning these oils and refined fuels.

	<TEXT> I mean that's not really the twist, it's a starting scenario. 

After arriving in hell

The writer just chose a direction that used this scenario as the ending to his story. He chose to focus on the build up and the details (and did a great job). 

The prompt writer himself came out and said that this story went in a completely different direction than the 3 ideas he had played out in his head.  </TEXT>
