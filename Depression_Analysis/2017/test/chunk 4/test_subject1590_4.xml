	<TEXT> Someone was sharing on LinkedIn and I thought it's interesting for data scientists.

1. Data is never clean
2. You will spend most of your time cleaning and preparing data.
3. 95% of the tasks do not require deep learning.
4. 90% of cases GLM will do the trick.
5. Big Data is just a tool.
6. You should embrace the Bayesian approach.
7. No one cares how you did it.
8. Academia and business are two different worlds.
9. Presentation is key - be a master of PowerPoint.
10. All models are wrong, but some are useful.
11. There is no full automated data science. You need to get your hands dirty. </TEXT>

sometimes a case could be investigated by both the police   the university (e.g. campus police). The university investigation only determines if you get to stay in the school. It does not replace police investigation, nor does it imply the police won't look it anymore. </TEXT>
