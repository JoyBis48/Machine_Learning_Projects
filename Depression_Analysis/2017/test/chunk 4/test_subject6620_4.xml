That aside, this is going to be the highest caliber hockey since 2010; let's just hope our 10 hawks play well and don't get hurt.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Gary is such a sad story. There were 180,000 people in Gary 50 years ago. Now there might be 75,000. About 50% of their kids are graduating from high school. Someone correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm going to assume that crime is out of control. I just moved back to Chicago after living in DC for a year. I stopped in Gary with my big clunky u haul, and was immediately approached by the gas station security guard. He seemed curious to know why I chose to stop there, then warned me it was a bad area. It just struck me as desolate. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you really love Hemingway you'll enjoy the place. I do remember going here on a field trip though. Some girl passed out because it was 95 degrees  in there. My teacher hated Hemingway, and later apologized for the trip being a part of the curriculum. There was a guy who was about 100 giving the tour, and I think his name was Jim Christmas. He was pretty hilarious.

For what it's worth, visit the Hemingway foundation across the street. There are some cool samples of his writing from way back, including a description of a football game that he wrote in 9th Grade at OPRF. Hemingway got an F on it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Incentive? 

Yes, this could work. As long as it is structured and serves a purpose. 20 minutes per week of reading current news stories and listening to music is a way I reward students if they meet the expectation. (All assignments attempted, no behavior referrals, no excessive tardies, etc.) 

Also hype up your incentives. Once a month, I'll raffle a Chipotle/Subway gift card to a student who has no missing assignments, no behavior referrals, and less than two tardies.  </TEXT>
