	<TEXT> I'm not sure if it changes where you are from but as long as you have a medical note from your doctor and you have been experiencing problems with it then you should 'qualify'.

Whether you are in uni or have a job or both - depression can make it a lot harder to keep up and get by. </TEXT>
