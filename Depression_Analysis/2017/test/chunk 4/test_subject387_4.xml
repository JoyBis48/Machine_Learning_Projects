	<TITLE> How was Eobard Thawne destined to become the Flash's greatest rival if he existed in the future beyond Barry Allen's lifespan? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-05-27 18:48:55 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> In the comics, Eobard Thawne (Professor Zoom/Reverse Flash) was a huge Flash fan and travelled back in time to meet Barry Allen. However, he miscalculated and ended up in a time after Barry Allen died and discovered that he was destined to become Barry Allen's greatest enemy which drove him crazy.  

My question is... how would he be destined to become Barry Allen's greatest enemy if he was born after Barry Allen died? (Obviously, he does travel back in time to fight the Flash and ruin his life BUT this was before he finds out he was his greatest enemy.)

Hopefully this question makes sense.  It's something that always has bothered me about Eobard Thawne's background.

EDIT: Fuck you downvotes. It was a genuine question. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I dunno, Flash and Arrow had more enjoyable pilots, imo.

I don't like the clich "anti-hero" hates protagonist up until protagonist saves his/her life or something along those lines.

Jimmy Olsen was always a young comic relief character in the comics/DCAU continuity.    he's a grown ass black man here which makes me wonder what Lois Lane looks like.

But, hey, the effects are decent. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Do you think it'd be a mix of a Dynamic Timeline as well as the Multiverse Model? One could theorize that the reason Future Barry knew where, our, Present Barry was immediately and told him not to follow through with his plans was because Future Barry had already gone through the events of Flashpoint and not only went back in time, once again, to save his younger self but to also prevent his past self to ensue the events of Flashpoint in the first place.

Thus, a loop? </TEXT>
