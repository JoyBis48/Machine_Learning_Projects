	<TEXT> And how much do they pay for those balls I doubt it's 200 dollars and if so is it not about the fans. The whole point of the game is let the fans enjoy themselves and have an attachment to the game and the players. What's not better then a free ball from their favorite footballer to keep that fan hood? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Usually fans throw the ball back on the pitch and then there's two balls on the field which makes a delay either way time will be wasted. I believe we should be allowed to keep a ball for memory of the game like other sports do it's kinda unfair that we have to return and only have a cup with a team name to show for it. </TEXT>
