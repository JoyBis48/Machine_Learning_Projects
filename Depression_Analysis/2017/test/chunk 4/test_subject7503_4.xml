	<TEXT> First off no. 

In most states you are only required to present ID when you are being detained. Furthermore you can only be detained when the police have reasonable articulable suspicion that you have/will commit a crime. 

Secondly you should give a shit.The Fourth Amendment [is right here.](http://en.wikipedia.org /wiki/Fourth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution) You should go ahead and read up on it.  </TEXT>

And remember those 3 guys from her S rank? As soon as you enter the train to go back home those guys probably rape her and NTR the shit out of her, turning her into a sexslave so they don't have to pay for the meat to take turns on her </TEXT>

But in all seriousness though. When it first came out I liked it a lot, but after I tried giving it a second play through a few years ago the bad out weighed the good for me.
 
* The beginning is a huge draw fest.
* The enemy's level with you so there is no point grinding.
* You can exploit the junction system.  
* The story shit's itself.
* SPAAAAAAAACE.
* No Quistis sex scene. 
* Whatever.

It does have a few good things going for it.

* Triad 
* Comfy music
* Some really good side quests
* Very nice cut scenes.
* Quistis 

But that's just my opinion on it. I maybe be biased because I love 7 and 9 so much but thats just how I feel.

	<TEXT> Hey Shadows,

My name is Yu, and I hate every single one of you. All of you are fat, retarded, no-life's who spend every second of their night looking at the midnight channel. You are everything bad in the world. Honestly, have any of you ever gotten any S-Links? I mean, I guess it's fun not being able to face yourselves because of your own insecurities, but you all take to a whole new level. This is even worse than jerking off to pictures on deviant-art.

Don't be a stranger. Just hit me with your best shot. I'm pretty much null to everything. I was captain of the drama club, and center on my basketball team. What sports do you play, other than "fuse shit teir persona"? I also get straight A's thanks to my max knowledge, and have a banging hot waifu (She just made another commercial; Shit was SO splash). You are all shadows who should just hama yourselves. Thanks for listening.

	<TEXT> Burnett could face up to life in the prison on the rape charge. The attempted capital murder charge could carry up to a life sentence if decided by jury. If it went to a judge, the sentence would range from no less than 20 years up to "one day less than life."

What is a one day less than life sentence?

	<TEXT> Israel does not give a fuck about those dead teens. Hamas is just a convenient scape goat for them to kill Palestinians. All because "God" said that land is theirs. Whats even worse is that my country supports and helps pay for genocide. I'm so fucking sick of paying taxes for this bullshit. I barely make enough too support myself and my daughter but my government will give billions to Israel. Fuck this country, and fuck Israel. 

Any Canada bros wanna take us in? </TEXT>
