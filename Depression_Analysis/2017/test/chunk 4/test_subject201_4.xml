	<TEXT> I don't but I could make some and post it. Now that I think of it I really should share my plans because its amazing how effective it is. The difference is like popping a balloon with a pin and untying the knot and letting the air out slow. PM me if you need the plans asap. But I will make some and post it on this sub. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Defiantly let it pass through. I did a lot of research/ trial and error before coming up with this. What happens when the bullet travels through the tube air is escaping out the holes and you want as much of that air to go away as possible so do away with the inner tube. Tried it and it works way better. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes the silencer is functional and work VERY well at suppressing the sound. It is modeled from how a real suppressor is made and works but with much less expensive material. The barrel is made from 3 aluminum cans (short v8 cans) and the 3 air breaks are made from 3 aluminum energy drinks that have a screw on cap. I also hot glued cotton around the chambers to further reduce the noise which works great. Its amazing the difference. It fits nice and snug with no screwing thanks to a sharpie pen that fits into the 1/4 inch hole after the muzzle. Anymore questions let me know. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks you! People can be really harsh with their critics on this subreddit sometimes though. I hate when I just finish a piece that I put so much time and effort into and then just get down votes with no comments or reasons for them. I guess what i'm saying is keep your chin up if people want to be dicks. I know I have too. I think your really talented with your digital brush. Keep it up! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I prefer the cap for my type of work. I like the angled spray for stencles and obviously regular caps for actual graffiti. I'm a street ARTIST not a penis maker. I use what works I find it funny that krylon supports anti graffiti campaigns because I steal there paint and do it anyways. And as far as drips go, if your experienced enough you can control it. Go fuck yourself. </TEXT>
