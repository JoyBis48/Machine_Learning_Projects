	<TEXT> Not sure if anyone explained, but this is copied and pasted from an article:

The important thing to note is that theyre not suing Fox under US Law (because it would probably go nowhere and theyve probably been informed of this by the French Ambassador in Washington).

The lawsuit is most likely in French Court (which has a lower standard of proof for libel cases than US courts, and less restrained by Free Speech statutes like courts in the US are) and I also wouldnt be surprised if a similar suit had been, or will be filed in European (EU) court (Which is actually more serious and a bigger deal because that ruling wouldnt just be binding to France but to EU member states).

More than likely Foxs ability report and operate (effectively) in France is what would be effected, with broader implications in the rest of Europe which is why they were so quick to come out with that apology last weekwhich you never EVER see them do in the US even when theyve been proven patently wrong in their reporting by THEIR OWN news reporting, sometimes.

Britain and Birmingham was probably never going to suedespite Rupert Murdochs shaky relationship with the government there over the phone hacking scandal, due to similar high standards for libel suits (which is why the tabloids there put the US Tabloids to shame), and also because Murdoch has a lot of connections (read: business interests) there, but the situation is vastly different in France.
