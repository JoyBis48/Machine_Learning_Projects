On a related note, if you're a fan of alt-j, give Battleme a listen.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Let's talk: Tony Bennett and Lady Gaga -- "Cheek to Cheek" </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-10-15 23:07:52 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> This is an album that I normally would never listen today, but I work in a store that sells CDs and quite a few people have been buying this lately. This morning, we played it at the store and I like what I heard, so I listened to it more closely when I got home from work. I have to say, it blew me away. 


While it definitely sounds more like a Tony Bennett album than a Lady Gaga album, Gaga knocks it out of the park. Her voice is a natural fit for this genre of music. In fact, she blows Tony Bennett out of the water. 


When I played this album, I couldn't help but imagine myself in a 1950s club, sitting at a table with a cigar and a glass of scotch...wearing a silk robe, while Bennett, Gaga and their band do their thing on stage. Even if this isn't your usual genre, it wasn't mine, give the album a spin because it truly is outstanding.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So 4th and goal from inside the 2. We opt to go for the TD and put the game away rather than make it a 13 point game and force their rookie QB to lead two touchdown drives.


4th and 1 near the STL 40 yard line. We opt to go for it rather than punt and pin the Rams inside their own 15. Instead, the Rams, who need a TD and a field goal to tie the game, only need to drive about 25 yards to get into field goal range. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's basically like Snapchat. You take a picture and all of your matches can see and "like" it for 24 hours. It's really pretty stupid, but if I can think of something funny to do, I'll do it. Android has moments too.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've never had much luck with parlay bets, especially in football where upsets are fairly common, but they sure are exciting! I usually only do parlays when there are two events that are near sure things. You can usually find them in the early rounds of tennis tournaments when two top seeds are playing unknowns or in Champions League soccer when a great team is playing a team from a much smaller league. For football, I usually stick to single bets. If there are two games that I feel especially confident in, I will parlay the money lines.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Don't let that scare you away. 


I'm assuming you know what a parlay bet is, but if you don't, it's a single bet on multiple events. In this case, if the Packers win by 3.5 or more points and the Patriots win by more than three, you win. If either outcome does not occur, you lose. It seems like a reasonable bet to me. 


The -105 is referring to the odds that the Packers will win by 3.5 points or more. It's just a way for you to be able to quickly calculate about how much your return on the bet would be. The minus sign means the outcome is favored to happen. The higher the number is above 100, the more heavily favored it is. When dealing with points spreads, the odds are usually right around 100, meaning your profit will be slightly less than your original bet. If the odds say "Even", you will win exactly what you bet. If there is a plus sign in font of the odds, the event is not expected to happen. If something has odds of +115, it means you would win $115 on a $100 bet.

	<TEXT> That's just tthe odds. In order to win $100, you would need to bet $105. Not sure why the Pats don't show the odds though.  </TEXT>
