	<TITLE> Original Pressing of Aenima on Vinyl </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-04-10 20:07:27 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Since there seems to be an almost zero chance of finding the original pressing of Aenima on vinyl, would any of you lucky owners be willing to rip and share yours? I've heard so many good things about the recording, and it being my favorite album of all time, I'm dying to hear it. Not sure if it would be near the same quality, but I'm willing to try anything at this point.

EDIT: I should go on *record* here and say that I am not a fan of "pirating" music, and that I buy all the music I enjoy listening to, that this plea is nothing but a desperate man trying to fulfill his curiosity. I'd love nothing more than to take a trip back to 1996 this weekend and buy my own copy for a price that wouldn't take food from my children's mouths. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I listen to all sorts of music, mostly metal. Of course I don't like to play dreary stuff around my son who is just hitting the 20 month mark here, so my other acquired tastes have come in handy. Not that they have a positive message per se, but it's all about being instrumental, upbeat, and light (electronica is good for this). The little guy loves to dance and bob his head around. Anyways, try a few of these maybe.

	<TEXT> I did an Aircraft Structural Repair course through a Transport Canada approved school, I then applied all across the country to find a position. Once my foot was in the door I gained more and more experience until I completed the required task list in a logbook, then I wrote an exam to acquire my AME 'S' license. Everything I do involves reading and understanding engineering approved repairs and OEM drawings. Engineers do not over see the project at hand, but are there as support if there is a deviation from drawing spec. As a licensed tech I would never put my name to anything that wasn't to drawing spec, or deviated without engineering approval.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Without getting into too much detail, we would remove and replace the upper and lower outboard wing panels, beef up the outboard wing ribs, and add reinforcements to the wing stringers both in the wings and the centre tanks. Of course last but not least, hang the winglets.

EDIT: Eventually the 737's came from the factory with all the added rework complete, so that if a customer wanted to hang winglets, all they had to do was purchase and hang them up.

EDIT: Stringers not stingers. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Please take my opinion lightly, but I've read your post and all the comments in it. It seems to me most of you are taking it all way too seriously, who gives a fuck? You're not going to change how other people perceive or feel about it, so why even bother. I'm with you on the matter but it's pointless to bring it up. Some people like things in a way that you don't, good lord better point it out, that'll teach them. Singling out the downfalls of others is pretty sophomoric in itself, why not make a post expressing your "insight" in a more constructive way? Why not tell us how Tool's music has affected you, changed you, or got you through a hard time, effectively removing the spot light from the "idols"? As for the comment here literally over analyzing the shit out of the whole thing, I've never read a more desperate attempt at trying to have Maynard personally login and and agree. Jesus H Christ people, it's music, of course the contributing artists will get credit equal to the greatness of the art. It's the exact same reason why many humans throughout history have become house hold names. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As of this past weekend I have found out that my 4x4 actuator has failed, and my truck would not disengage from H4. I did some quick googling and found that this may be a common problem on newer Toyota models, however I wanted to know if any of you had experience with this issue. My truck is still covered by warranty so for now I will be spared the financial and labor burdens. However, if this is common I would like to know more about what it does exactly, and how I could prevent it from happening again (if possible) and/or fix it myself. 

Thanks in advance for your time. 

*FYI: I am not a mechanic, but I am mechanically inclined and wish to learn more about my vehicle as I am required.* </TEXT>

The guy writes:

*"UPC code is 6 1422-31087-1 1 There's another number on the back: 72445-11087-1"*

Does that make sense? Because it doesn't seem to. It would appear to be two different pressings. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I personally don't mind flipping $100.00 on a big production act, I know it isn't cheap to haul all of their gear around, not to mention the show itself is totally worth it, but this has been taken to a new level of expensive.

Again, I could probably land some $100.00 tickets during the public sale, but nothing short of the first 30 rows would make my 35 hours of driving worth it.

I'm with you on the underground, Animals As Leaders are playing downtown here for 25 dollars, can't get much better than that. </TEXT>

* I took the picture with my phone because I wanted to quickly send it to my cousin and didn't want to go through the process on my phone.

* These are the "platinum" seats for Red Rocks using the "MYWAVE" Soundgarden fan club code.

* It is my personal opinion that no one is worth this much and that these are obviously reserved for the rich. (Unless of course there was some kind of meet and greet and/or sound check attendance which even then I wouldn't flip the bill)

* I can't see Trent agreeing to this after all he's stood up and said regarding corporations with hands in his pockets. What the actual fuck is going on here?

Otherwise, you could go full on custom, it'll cost quite a bit more but look pretty rad. This is assuming of course this wave of posters are again, not of standard size.
