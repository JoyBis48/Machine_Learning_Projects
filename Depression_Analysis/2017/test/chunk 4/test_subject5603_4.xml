	<TEXT> Maybe I didn't say it clearly. In the example the poorer man still has the same income $10, but the richer's man income has nearly doubled $190.

	<TEXT> But that's not how its working.  The wages and incomes of the lower 70% (or so depending on whose numbers you use ) have remained relatively flat for decades, while the incomes of the richest have grown dramatically.  In your example it would be more like the total wealth has grown to 200 , and the rich man is getting $190.  
And honestly do you really think the left 'the left would rather everyone made $15 instead, less for everyone but at least we're equal'.  Why would you think making caricatures out of other peoples opinions is  convincing anyone?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Parental expectations and involvement are the most important ingredient to success in school. (I knew someone whose father was a  massive steelworker who was determined that his children would do well.  She told me there was never any question about doing homework in her house.)  But the isolation of inner city students has a big role in the failure rate and making the schools dysfunctional. I live in a smaller city, not big enough for us to have segregated ourselves too much economically, and all four of our high schools have a significant population of students from impoverished families. (At my kids high school there are students from both the wealthiest part of town and from a couple of rather grim housing projects. ) While the schools have their issues, all of them are reasonably successful and manage to serve economically diverse populations. But that kind of high school has disappeared in most larger urban areas.  Instead we have some schools that serve almost exclusively impoverished students, which clearly has a multiplier effect on the difficulties and discipline issues.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'd agree with some of your statement. Building a nice high school building might make it easier to learn, but it doesn't guarantee successful outcomes.  And unfortunately, far too many lower income families don't understand the need to take schooling seriously. 
But ,
1) High school is too late. Student are far better off going to good elementary schools and a lesser quality high school. What a student brings to high school matters more than the school itself.
2) Isolating the poorer students tends to reinforce the social problems. Of course you're going to see more gang activities in one high school if it's the only school attended by kids who tend to get caught up in gangs. If the staff needs to spend a lot of time on disciplinary and violence issues, there's that much less time and resources for teaching, and more disruption. Students who are not disruptive themselves wind up with less education, through no fault of their own. 
3) The quality of the staff probably matters more than the building.  I know in my town we had one elementary school that was barely functional, until they replaced the principal.  The place still has it's issues, but it's a whole lot better. I obviously have no idea what the staff is like in the schools you mentioned, but I think better teachers tend to avoid the worse schools.

Although I disagree with much of what you've said, I think it's a well written and thoughtful comment. Keep at it.

	<TEXT> Ruth Ginsburg, in her dissent on the supreme Court decision,  has a different view about Texas IDs.

Texas will not accept several forms of photo ID permitted under the Wisconsin law the Court considered last week. For example, Wisconsins law permits a photo ID from an in- state four-year college and one from a federally recognized Indian tribe. Texas, under Senate Bill 14, accepts neither. Nor will Texas accept photo ID cards issued by the U. S. Department of Veterans Affairs. Those who lack the approved forms of identification may obtain an election identification certificate from the Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS), but more than 400,000 eligible voters face round-trip travel times of three hours or more to the nearest DPS office.Moreover, applicants for an election identification certificate ordinarily must present a certified birth certificate [which] can be obtained only at significant costat least $22 for a standard certificate sent by mail.

	<TEXT> 1) If the legislators pushing voter ID were truly worried about voter fraud, they would make provisions so every voter had an ID. When you have laws in Texas that make a gun ID valid for voting (more often owned by conservatives) and a student ID not valid (a group that tends to vote more liberal), it strains credulity to think it's only about voter fraud.
2) In person voter fraud is insignificant, less that a rounding error. I'd be far more concerned about who counts the votes.    </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This article is genuinely hilarious. Republicans score an average of .7 more correct answers in a news poll (about a 6% difference) , and the author is wetting himself because that proves Republicans are better informed than Democrats. And do you notice the article doesn't link to survey?  Wouldn't want people checking the survey for themselves, would you?  </TEXT>

Go to the actual [Pew survey](http://www.people-press.org/2014/10/02/from-isis-to-unemployment-what-do-americans-know/2/) (which oddly enough, the author somehow overlooked providing a link to), and see if you think the writer is giving a fair representation of the survey.

Many economists say that, as the economy continues to gradually strengthen over time, the wage picture should improve. 

Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen is watching the wage issue closely. She has stated the goal of encouraging full employment, with the wage growth that comes with it, even as she also has to watch against the risk of rising inflation. </TEXT>
