	<TEXT> For me I use my ears to learn and eyes. If I can see it and hear it, I repeated it two things and see it again and hear it. I remember it. Now my fetish is Japanese women, and I'm saving money or coaxing a good friend of mine to make a recording of all the vocabulary, short diagrams, or just formulas
 And beat off to it while listening to it. Ever since I done this my GPA increased dramatically. also ask me about American History from 100BC to Rosevelt, I know pretty much everything.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You may see college as a financial hole and time but it's worth it. You learn so much. You become more prone to stupid shit non educated people would fall into. Unless you're already have an alternative to enrich your life, then by all means work from online. But it's best to have a back up plan? ex. I'm going for therapist (Love this job) but I'm always taking the TESLO/CBEST so I can teach if needed. But if your plans don't require pursuing education then it's not for everyone.  </TEXT>

For me, I tried waiting for the Note 5- I had a Note 2, but it broke- I bought a temp. phone (lumia630) fucking phone sucked! I missed my note 2, so I bought a Note 4, new for $520. Regrets. My life is more better with this companion, as I use it EVERY HOUR. ( except sleep) Cheers!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I didn't really scrutinize the battery to accurately say, but from conjecture. I did this. Did not charge the battery full when it first arrived- I didn't have time. The future is now- battery was 50% right off the bat. Then I let it drain from that day on, by itself. Once it drained I let it charge over night to 100% (while off) then I turned it on, following that I did the same thing again. By the 4-6th day the battery was give or take calibrated. Although, it's not 100%, more like 90%. My phone stays on 1% for about 2-4 hours, which sucks because the screen turns lowest brightness and I can't use the camera, damn you Sansumg for being so conservative...  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you for your input. I haven't visited the campus yet, but I saw the website online and it has amazing features. Is there a lot of student involvement on campus? E.x clubs, third party merchants, solicitors, or just frequently updated bulletins?  At CSUSB, there is only about 4-11 active clubs on campus, compared to the "300+" they have registered. Thank you again for reading and your time! </TEXT>
