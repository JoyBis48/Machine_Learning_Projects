	<TEXT> Dear brother, 27 years you will never get back. No matter the amount of money you will receive for this it can never make up for the things you wanted and hoped for.  I feel for you and I hurt for you. May you be free to do as you please. 27 years you stared at those gray walls hoping things weren't the way they were. I am honored you are a part of this community again and I hope justice is brought to those who it is bestowed upon. 

Love from Toledo </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Having an alcoholic father and being an alcoholic myself, please do not stop this journey. I found my father for dead after a long day of us both binge drinking (not together) and was so messed up I couldn't save him myself. I hope the best for you and your journey. I wish my father could watch me go through mine.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> First off I agree with the people that are saying it's the eyebrows. That's a big part of it. Also, the woman is AGING. We all get older and all age differently. She hasn't been using fillers either...leave the woman alone. We have other issues in the world to worry about other than her appearance. Priorities people.  </TEXT>
