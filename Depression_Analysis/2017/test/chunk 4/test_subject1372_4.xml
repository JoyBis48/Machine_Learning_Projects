	<TITLE> Can we get Automod to add flair to a post based on the content in a comment? </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> This would be an extremely handy feature. In a subreddit where flair is not mandatory, it could be a savior.

On /r/vine, there's a flair for unusually loud vines. But if the poster refuses to flair it properly, and a moderator never checks it, users could keep falling victim to a loud vine raping their ears.

So what if a comment that said

 \#tooloud

could get automoderator to automatically flair the post or tell the moderators that the post needs flair? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Because with cable, you're paying for a services that presses a switch and let's you access their channels. The money you pay doesn't go to the companies who host their channels. The companies need money to maintain those channels and to maintain their slot on the sevice of the providers. The only way they can do this is for advertisers to give them money to also be on that channel.

Netflix: you pay for Internet, and you pay for content to keep Netflix funded.

Cable: you pay for cable, and advertisers pay to keep content funded.

The cable company does not put ads on each channels. They rent channels to content providers. Unless you want to donate millions of dollars to a channel's content providers to keep content ad free, you cannot complain. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Negating and destroying are two different mechanics. An effect, when activated, is not attached to the card. The best way I can put it is as follows.

Imagine each zone has a su zone that effects go into when a card is activated in that space. Even though the card may be removed or destroyed, it's separate from the effect and the effect is not influenced by what happens to the card. (The ONLY difference is continuous effects. Those cannot apply unless the card is resolved, face-up on the field, and hasn't been destroyed.)

So, to negate an effect, a card effect must specifically go after the effect to affect it. Therefor, cards that only destroy a card do not affect the effects of the cards that are activated. </TEXT>

The same applies for comment karma as well. tried it out, looked fine. Althrough, I don't see a problem either way. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Emulation is typically used to play old, rare, and out-of-print games whose developers no longer make any money on. It is still technically illegal if you don't own the game, but for those who have the game but have ruined discs or their PS1 no longer works, it's not exactly the devil's work. Meanwhile, piracy in this day is more associated with obtaining recently released media for free through means other than borrowing or getting as a gift. Basically, stealing. Since the media (be it game, movie, or song) is new and still actively makes money for the publisher, it has a more significant impact on publishers. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I actually must disagree. I see many more characters competing with Fox/Falco/C.Falcon etc. It's just easy for Melee players to Pop over, default to fox, and make it feel like Melee+. After all, I barely see fox even win a tournament for Project M. Most of the time it's not even a Melee top tier.

Fox and Falco were not immune to nerfs in their development. I seem to remember reading that they no longer have any frames of invincibility during Shine startup and Fox's Up-smash was nerfed in 3.5. Not to mention, Falco's recovery is still noticeably worse than Melee. And as I recall, everyone thought puff was simply unviable in 3.02 because everyone's recovery was too good. But since everyone's nerfed, puff magically seems better (even though she's not any better than before). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's assuming 100% of Wii's were sold to people who knew it was backwards compatibility AND bought it as a GameCube. I'd imagine that 70 million people who never played video games before bought a Wii because it was also a GameCube (not really). We cannot assume that anybody bought it for that soul reason since it seems only 30 million of past customers even wanted a GameCube. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They can, but that doesn't mean they will. We have to assume that consoles that had larger install bases will have larger fanbases and more fans who want to play those games again. So, let's count how many gamecubes were sold. Now let's count how many Wiis were sold.

I thought so. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I could not give any solid reason as to why I think they will have a better time or even a more successful launch. As it is, it really is just an expensive accessory to an already expensive phone. Well, if you want to get all of its features, you need an expensive phone. But, I think there are reasons for both Apple doing better and Apple doing worse.

Apple will likely have much better marketing. Let's face it, you would be hard pressed to find any proof of other smarteatches being marketed to consumers through consumer channels. I talk about Tv and non-tech internet sights. It will probably boast things the consumer may find useful straight to the consumer and really put it in there face. Not to mention, even non-savy consumers can follow what Apple is doing by watching events on YouTube and following places like /r/Apple. So, much more people may know about it in the first place. Regular consumers like that don't have an easy time following Samsung or Sony with their individual releases. 

The. Again, Apple's watch is not much different from other smart watches feature-wise. And despite this particular watch having a dial, tracking your heart-rate, and being able to switch straps, it doesn't sound too much more intriguing than any other smart watch. Call it what you want, it is still a watch that much stay bound to your wrist out in the open to use its core features.

These are both coming from a hardcore Apple fan who would easily have all of Apple's latest gear if he could afford them. </TEXT>

This isn't the end of Project M tournaments. They'll still be around. In the mean time, we really should show Nintendo our love for the series by at least trying Smash 4 if we haven't played it already. It gets so many things right where Brawl simply got everything wrong. Really, the only thing I can say I don't like about Smash 4 is the stupid-as-hell Up+B auto-sweet-spot.

Basically, it's so you wouldn't *have* to buy both the home console and mobile hardware. If you prefer one over the other, you could just pick on and stick with it.

Not everyone will have ads disabled, and regardless of adblockplus existing, every detail must be taken into account. I have Adblockplus and it doesn't block reddit's ads because (the way reddit's default does it), they are nonintrusive and labeled as ads in a stand-out way so people don't confuse it with an unsponsored link.

The sidebar doesn't need to pop. It's something that regular redditors know is there, and it's not going to change drastically between subreddits.

Don't have to tell me how easy opacity is. This is the stuff I went to school to learn. I have the degree to show for it, too. Now that I'm done tooting my own horn, I'm thinking of possible solutions I think might work. I'll need some time to test them. I might just cheat and look at how Konami did it in the first place.

	<TEXT> Melee top tiers exempt from nerfs? Far from it. In Melee, Fox and Falco had a frame of invincibility on the startup of their shines which has been removed on each one. Fox's up smash was drastically reduced so that light characters don't die to him at 50% anymore on average stages. Falco's recovery sucks. That may be a part of brawl they decided to keep for one reason or another but the point still stands. Sheik's combos have been cut down from version 1.0. Marty has had tiny little changes to warrant a different playstyle. Puff, pretty much the same except with some higher knock back on some moves making her combo game much weirder to pull off if ever.

Melee top tiers are not immune to nerfs. But they're designs are bound to their Melee playstyle.

I really think that what PMDT is trying to do is use the Melee top tiers as a guidelines. If PNDT thinks all characters can be as good as Fox and Falco, then at least they should be worth a try. Heck, Hungry Box is even playing puff again. Wiz robe still plays sonic. PK Fire in shield was removed and PK flash doesn't seem to have the same power, but NZA (I take it from him since he's the best Ness I've seen) thinks Ness has actually improved overall.

Just because a character is needed one way does not mean that they are worse. All changes to a character should be taken into account. Everyone can basically live longer against Melee top tiers despite their needed recoveries. </TEXT>

And, instead of having alternating themes/banners, runner-ups can be used in the other subreddits such as /r/ygosales and /r/ygobinders and /r/yugiohfeedback. That way we get representation from more than just 1 designer.

Also, still seriously not liking the side-bar. Colors make sense, except for yellow on white which is hard to read. But buttons are simply much bigger than usual buttons and I seems to notice a high reliance on shadows for depth effects. Not exactly an element that Konami uses if we're trying to emulate their look and feel.

The dropdowns on the dropdown menus also seem to have a bit too much transparency. (same goes for the tabmenu.) On pages like these with a lot of text near the menus, the words will be painful to look at. That background making the arrow pointing right should also have a hover property so it looks like it's a complete element. Otherwise, it looks incomplete, or even like an oversight.

(Yes, I'm really going to make a fuss over the UI of this place.)

Good UI gets the information to the user and gets out of the way without intruding significantly on the experience. Default reddit CSS doesn't take up nearly as much space (even with the banner ad, it takes up less space than our header alone). </TEXT>
