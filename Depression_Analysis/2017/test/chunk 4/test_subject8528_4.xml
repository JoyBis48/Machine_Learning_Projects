	<TEXT> Sorry that it took me so long to respond.

Here are the three figures that I have:

* [Sengoku Nadeko](https://i.imgur.com/fOzb9qi.jpg) from Monogataru Second Season (This is the one I won from the crane game)

* [Saber](https://i.imgur.com/axrrMeF.jpg?1) from Fate/Stay Night

* [Saber Lilly Nendoroid](http://i.imgur.com/jSKdPsz.jpg) (Nendoroids are basically a small figure with an accented head size. They are also modular.) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I feel the same way about this. I, basically, do not talk about anime/manga at all unless someone else references or brings it up in a conversation. If they do and it is in a public situation where others can hear, I act as though I know nothing.

I had the opportunity to go to Japan this year as part of a class trip and I did pick up a few things while I was there. I was extremely hesitant to buy any sort of figure but I won one from a crane game at a Taito Game Station. 

My Mom thinks they are cool and I have no idea what my Dad thinks of them... :/ </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I know this is digressing, but oh well. Black Rock Shooter is, originally, a Hatsune Miku song by Supercell. I do not remember the name/username of the person, but someone made a music video having the character, which is heavily influenced by the character design of Hatsune Miku, go through the story in the lyrics through the video. That music video and story got really popular which prompted a novel, manga, OVA, anime, merchandise, etc into what you know today.


Sorry about that, I used to be into vocaloid stuff a few years ago and I remember when this was all happening. I haven't, other than knowing f and f2 are out and Mirai on the 3DS soon, been following the scene for awhile.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Looking for a good romance light novel. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-11-29 06:46:59 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> For the past few weeks, I have been reading a number of light novels, but I am trying to find ones that are mainly romance/comedy oriented.

The only real requirement that I have is for the novels to:

1. Not have ecchi
2. An MC that isn't a blatant self-insert. (What I mean by that is a setting where the MC goes from some recluse to having a harem overnight because he is nice to them. These are, mainly, the fantasies of the author and as such they do not have a lot of depth)
3. Not a lot of vocabulary that is unique to the story. I get it that they have to describe certain mechanics, but there are better ways to ago about world building without is being a bunch of random terms together.

Some examples of what I am looking for:

* Hikaru ga Chikyuu ni Itakoro......
* Toradora
* Hyouka

While it may seem that I am only asking for realistic romance stories, that isn't the case but they are the ones that I can think of off the top of my head. (Heck, Index could work here.) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Anything is better than nothing. Also, I believe that YouTube only contacts those who meet certain qualifications for monetization. 

No one know how much they are going to make for sure since the CPM differs on the demographics that the videos bring in as advertisers are going to target their demographic.

I can say, however, that if you are going to do it be aware that, unless you join a network, you will only get paid when you reach $100 in your pending amount on AdSense. (This is public information and it is not a statement of how much I, personally, have made through YouTube.) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It is a combination of the video ads, the ads on the side and the ones that pop up during the video on the bottom. Someone who is monetized can set which of these ads are shown or all of them.

It is and isn't on views. You are insunating that it is determined by someone watching the video, but even going on the page and having it up will cause an "impression". (aka ad view)

Google has been in the advertising business for years so it is near impossible to exploit and if you do your account will be frozen and you will no longer be monetized. (Youtube uses Google's AdSense platform for ads)

 Charles Barkley was a child prodigy at basketball. Anybody with him on their team would automatically win. He was just that good. After his mother, who was also his coach, died, he had a mental breakdown and refused to join a team ever again.
 
 Two years later, Barkley still hasn't come to terms with his mother's loss. Every time he tries to make a shot, he can no longer see where the basket is. He's resigned himself from ever playing basketball again, and enjoys his life spending time with Russell Wilson and Peyton Manning, as they enjoy their favorite sports.
 
 That is, until Michael Jordan comes along. Jordan's a free-spirited basketball player, and he sparks Barkley into trying to learn how to play again. He teaches him that basketball isn't just about making the shot: it's about enjoying the thrill of the game. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It is a site called Mechanical Turk which is owned and operated by Amazon. They allow requesters, who are mainly either researchers or companies, who need people to tasks that computers cannot do such as surveys or even classifying images and such.   You have to be a US Citizen and have a SSN which you will have to provide Amazon for the I-9 form for taxes. If you make more than $600 a year Amazon has to send you the form to fill out for income tax purposes. 

There is always work to do and there are opportunities for higher pay once you do a number of hits. (Typically 1000 and 5000) The minimum rate you want to shoot for is $0.10 a minute. ($6 an hour) but it pays a lot better than swagbucks and what not. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As a heads up, you have to get your tickets well in advance as there is normally a three or more month wait list. Why is there such a long wait list for it? They only admit 200 people per day.

Also, it is really hard to get tickets outside of Japan since you have to get them at a Lawson (A chain of convenience stores in Japan) or through a [designated travel agency.](http://www.ghibli-museum.jp/en/ticket-information/) (The link is to the Ghibli Museum's page about how to get tickets outside of Japan) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It is by the same mangaka as Pastel, which is a similar but much longer series. (Some say it drags on, but I think that is in part to the lack of people translating it. I know, for a fact since I saw it myself, that the series is at least up to volume 32 in Japan but the translations are around volume 28.) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The anime, which is based upon the visual novel, is extremely popular in both the Japanese and Western communities. While I haven't played the visual novel, the anime is one of the few that have made me cry and the only one that has made any serious impact upon my life. (You may think I am crazy, but Clannad made me look at family and what it all entails in a new way.)

The visual novel is also known for its extreme length. I remember reading, according to a walkthrough, that even knowing where the branch points are and where to save, to read all of the routes takes anywhere from 90-120 hours. Otherwise it is closer to 200-300 hours of reading.

The VN and anime is renowned for its soundtrack and the usage of these tracks to emphasize certain scenes. If you want to listen to it, the OST is on iTunes in most countries.

**EDIT:** To give you an idea, the amount of hype around this coming to the English markets in the visual novel fanbase is along the lines of Valve announcing Half-Life 3. People thought it would never happen and yet, here it is. </TEXT>
