	<TEXT> Honestly as long as you can play a few it doesn't really matter. If you can play 2 champs of each type you're pretty much set. And a pro would need a max of 5 champions that he can play, since their roles are set, and that's assuming the other team was so worried about him that they used all their bans on his champs and the person in the same role on their team also picked one that he played. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Honestly you're probably going to be worse off. If you've only unlocked champions you like you've probably played those ones more, meaning you're better with them. If you have too many you're not going to be good with any of them. And even if you did get more, if you're only good with a few it doesn't matter about the others.

Also if you play ARAM (All Random, All Middle) having more champions is a big disadvantage.

	<TEXT> I kind of agree with you. My opinion is Buffy would have better individual episodes. I think there are a lot of Buffy episodes that are better than pretty much any Angel episode on an episode by episode basis. But Angel had way better overall storyline and plot arcs. I felt like Angel was actually building somewhere, especially since it had a consistent enemy throughout the show. Plus obviously the redemption story for everyone in the show was great. I feel like Angel just got much deeper. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I had a Catholic brother as the rector of my dorm in college. He had been in rehab the semester before I got there for alcoholism. He was absolutely oustanding, for the record, the entire time I was there. I imagine the loneliness is part of it. I think for him at least, a big part of it was the temptation was there all the time. It's got to be a lot harder to stay sober when you see college kids getting drunk on a tuesday. That said, it also made his talks about the dangers of alcohol and alcoholism a lot more powerful. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We'd had problems for a while, and had always had fights over really dumb stuff. She was clingy and had a distinct lack of trust. She'd accuse me of cheating even though I was spending all my free time with her (apparently those group project I had were made up so I could go hook up with other girls). These were all exacerbated by distance when she graduated and I had a year left.

The straw that broke the camel's back, however, was a game of League of Legends. We would play together a fair amount. She was a pretty inconsistent player, though, so she'd have some pretty bad games. League's community being what it is, she'd get yelled at sometimes in game. Finally, after being told to stop feeding and eventually to uninstall, she quit in the middle of the game and within a week it was basically over. And that is how League of Legends ended my relationship. </TEXT>

Plays on the team that stops UCLA's 88 game win streak. After school goes to play in Europe for a year before working for Proctor and Gamble and then running a Budweiser distributor. Finally gets tired of that and helps to found Keurig. After having done that for a while he's retired now and just funds interesting projects and is now teaching at Notre Dame.

The other would be Alasdair MacIntyre.  He's one of the most highly regarded philosophers in the world and incredibly interesting to listen to. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Nate Montana is probably the worst quarterback I've ever had the misfortune of watching. This includes high school games. He came in against Michigan a few years ago and wasn't throwing picks like Tommy Rees was because he didn't have enough accuracy or arm strength to get it near anyone. Absolutely awful. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Golic was easily the weakest part of our O-Line this year. And the year before he filled in for Cave at center when he got hurt. He must have been telegraphing terribly because suddenly every D-Line we played jumped right at the snap. I'd be shocked if he's on the roster when games start. </TEXT>

Everyone stands around a table. There's a bunch of cups with about as much beer as you'd used for pong or flip cup, and one that's all the way full for the last person. 2 people are playing at once. It usually starts with people on opposite sides of the table. The goal is to bounce a ping pong ball into your cup. If you do that, you pass to your left. If you make it on your first try, you can pass it anywhere. If the person to your right manages to make one before you do, they slap your cup of the way, pass their cup to the person on your left, and you have to drink a new one. It goes until the last cup gets finished, and that person is the loser. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A kid I went to high school with's sister did Girls Gone Wild. She apparently made it into the commercial for that one, too. So he, his sister, and his parents are watching something like Comedy Central late at night and the commercial comes on. He sees his sister, looks over at his family, and walks out and goes to bed. He never asked about anything after that. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I loved during the NCAA tournament one year they were talking about how Wisconsin did really well when they held their opponents under 50 or some really low number. It just seemed so monotonous and obvious that they did well when they held the other team to a low number of points.  </TEXT>
