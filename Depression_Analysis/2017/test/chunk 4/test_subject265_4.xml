	<TEXT> I don't disagree. But, I think that statistics on poverty, education, and other socioeconomic factors should be the focus of such conversations. It's not like a person's race makes them any more or less likely to commit a crime.

	<TEXT> You make some fine points all of which I'm sure are being debated by the relevant authorities in Sweden and elsewhere. 

I'm not sure about prison being an effective deterrent to violent crime. At first glance, it seems obvious that it would be, but when you look at the socioeconomic and psychological causes of a lot of violent behavior, it becomes much more complicated. It's also worth mentioning that prisons in the US are known for victimizing inmates and conditioning them to be irrational and violent when they are eventually released. 

I'm getting a lot of downvotes here, and I guess I understand. If someone had done something like this to my child, prison for the offender wouldn't be the issue. But my argument is basically that we in US have been locking up anyone and everyone for several decades now. While overall crime has decreased, it's not necessarily a result of our increasingly militarized police or our eagerness to imprison even nonviolent offenders, and violent crime hasn't disappeared. 

There are people all over the world who would argue that what we're doing here is wrong, but we're not going to listen to them. It's up to us to come to our own conclusions. We are one of the least likely to allow any other body in the world to violate our sovereignty, yet we do it to others quite often. If a country like Sweden wants to operate a criminal justice system that focuses on aiding victims, rehabilitation, and preventing recidivism, they have every right to do so and we should let them.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't disagree that a rapist should spend at least some time in prison, but it's not my decision to make. 


My point is that you and I have no business making demands of the judges, juries, and lawyers of the judicial systems of sovereign foreign countries. The people of Sweden have faith in their elected and appointed officials.  Their system is focused on aiding the victims of crimes, rehabilitating offenders, and preventing recidivism. No amount of prison time served is going to unrape that girl.  </TEXT>

It's also a bit of a waste to move volunteers and resources so far when there's work to be done in their immediate communities. It's always good to help, but sometimes these projects end up backfiring in unforeseen ways. I've also heard arguments that these sorts of mission trips are chosen for selfish reasons such as getting to travel to exotic or distant locations or even the opportunity to evangelize to strangers.  </TEXT>

"More than a dozen" And those were just the times their overpriced PI was around to catch him. 

I'm not going to say that this wasn't a waste of money, but I'll argue that it wasn't a complete waste. Obviously some well placed, relatively inexpensive cameras could have  been as effective as this guy. But someone stealing that amount of public water is unacceptable. Fuck them for the way they did it though. They should have spent $5,000 to receive $15,000 or $20,000 in fines and penalties and then been able to use the surveillance equipment to catch other offenders.

	<TEXT> Poor women do not have access to any healthcare under medicaid. At least not until they get pregnant in my state. 

My insurance covers my routine checkups. It also covers me if something terrible happens that puts me in the hospital and unable to pay. 

Contraception is a preventative treatment. What about this aren't you understanding? Why should married people be required to wear condoms? 


"Wah! I don't want to contribute to something I'll ostensibly never benefit from even if I have benefited from it in the past, and my children will most likely benefit from it in the future. Screw everyone, I got mine!"

Literally millions of people are unable to afford preventative care and end up much sicker than they would have been otherwise. The costs are in the hundreds of billions of dollars. Tens of thousands will die in the states that refused to expand Medicaid solely to defy the president. 

Anyone who thinks that health insurance is complete rip off has never been sick and therefore working on the faulty logic of "it hasn't happened yet, and therefore won't ever happen", or is probably wealthy enough to not be worried about in the first place.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They lost the election by a split vote. Purely northern states wanted to impose their will on southern states.

Yeah nothing says tyranny like representative democracy. 


They fired first because they were idiots. 

Belligerent idiots. But yeah, no argument here. 


The seceded because they objected to having no say and no rights in their own territory.

This is where OP dives off the deep end. The Confederate states tried multiple times to force their will on the federal government as well as northern states themselves with the fugitive slave acts. Then they tried to force their will upon the people of Kansas when they contested its formation as a free state. 


By expand you mean establish more states with westward expansion? The North imposed their will on the south which completely violated the basic compact of the union in the first place. 

And how was that? By allowing Kansas to decide for themselves whether they wanted to allow slavery or not? Or by voting in the elections? 


And of course they would want them returned, they were property to them. This would be like crossing a state line and getting your car impounded then sold off because someone else didn't like that you owned it and you got nothing for it. 

Yeah it would be exactly like that if your car was a person you had enslaved and brought into a free territory. 



Slavery is still wrong, and it was a major issue, but it's not the whole sum of all issues. Both sides were dicks to each other. 


The protection of the institution of slavery was the sole reason for the South's secession. I'd have to say that the south were the bigger dicks being that they committed treason, attacked the US, considered owning people as property as the greatest material interest of mankind, and literally everything that the surviving confederates did in the decades after the war. 

Edit: I'm sorry, I thought this sub was about pointing out the factual errors of confederate and southern apologists. If I was mistaken, I'll gladly move on. .  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There *are zero out of pocket costs for contraception because it saves money in the long term. This isn't that complicated. Unwanted pregnancies are expensive for insurance companies and costly for our society. 

The reason people purchase insurance is to be prepared for the unknown. As far as healthcare goes, it's not a matter of if we'll get sick, but when. We've been denying people preventative care and forcing them into emergency departments long enough to know that experiment has been a failure. This is why we pay more than any other industrialized nation but aren't anywhere near the top in terms of care. You're calling me economically illiterate while simultaneously suggesting we continue to dig the same hole we've been digging for decades.  </TEXT>

Condoms are a form of contraception. The birth control pill can be used at the same time as condoms. 

Your family is sacrificing because you have to provide them health insurance? Well fuck that. I mean, I'm sure there aren't any females in your family right? And even if there were, they shouldn't have access to medical treatments for their lady parts right? That's just not Christian. /s

Your ideas are bad and you should feel bad. Private insurance requires members to pay premiums and deductibles out of their own pockets.

How do "rich white women" get free contraception, *and can you please explain this without using racism? 


Having bareback sex vs wearing a condom is a lifestyle choice.

What does this have to do with birth control? Who* the hell do you think you are that you can tell others what to do in the privacy of their own bedrooms and in the confidentiality of their doctors' offices? 


My family shouldn't have to sacrifice for either case.

Wtf does this even mean? Your family isn't sacrificing a damn thing. As it was already pointed out by another user, contraception is preventative treatment and is ultimately cost neutral or even represents a net savings. You're just whining because you don't feel like you're adequately getting to decide what others can and cannot do. 

Edit: was breaking a rule.

	<TEXT> It wasn't just a disagreement over the power of the Federal government. The South seceded and attacked the US to protect the institution of slavery and therefore the way of life for the Southern ruling elite. Ultimately the south was most upset over the creation of a new free state, Kansas. That and the election of Lincoln who opposed the expansion of slavery into new territories and states meant that the slave owning states had lost most of their political traction and their economic interests would be ignored. The Confederates weren't worried about states' rights when they opposed the formation of the new free state on the basis that slavery was an inalienable personal right that states couldn't take away. They weren't worried about states rights when they introduced and passed the fugitive slave acts and tried to force their will upon northern free states and the federal government who had no interest in capturing escaped slaves.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> From what I understand, the formation of Kansas as a free state did play a major part of the political situation and the South's secession. Kansas and the election of Lincoln meant more representation for those who opposed slavery or at least it's expansion.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> One of the biggest events that led to their secession was the formation of the new free state of Kansas. The Confederates felt that an individual state didn't have the legal right to prohibit slavery as it was a personal right. States' rights was a Confederate revisionist argument. The war was about preserving the institution of slavery and therefore the way of life for the Southern ruling elite.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's not necessarily true. The Confederate states argued against the formation of new free states and felt that slavery was a personal right. If the confederacy was interested in supporting states' rights they wouldn't have argued that new states had no legal right to prohibit slavery. They also wouldn't have been so upset that many northern states and the federal government had failed to enforce the fugitive slave acts to their liking.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The US had japan by it's balls because of the battle of Midway. Before that Japan was far more successful in the pacific. Had the US lost Midway they very well could've failed.

That's just ridiculous. The US had suffered no damage or attacks on homeland soil aside from Pearl Harbor. We were entirely intact and just getting started with our military industrial complex. Japan was suffering from repeated effective bombing campaigns and over a decade of economic sanctions and trade embargos. How do you come to the conclusion that "we very well could have failed"?

	<TEXT> While Germany was giving the soviets a run for their money.

Really? Or did they merely succeed in causing the deaths of millions of people before having their asses handed to them, their country burned to the ground, and half of it ultimately seized by force. Let's not forget that Germany's imperialism made much of Eastern Europe vulnerable to Soviet invasion and occupation. 

 If japan had won the battle of Midway and turned around the pacific, ( which they nearly did ) the axis had strong chances of winning WW2. 

But they didn't win, and there's nothing that suggests that the US would somehow have folded if we had lost midway. Let's not forget that the US was brought into the war by the bombing of Pearl Harbor. Do you think we would have just given up and surrendered to the Japanese? Outside of Pearl Harbor, we suffered virtually none of the mass destruction that parts of Asia and Europe suffered. We were entirely intact. Yes the Japanese fought hard but there was never a chance that they were going to defeat the US. By the time we dropped the a-bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan was largely burned to the ground.
