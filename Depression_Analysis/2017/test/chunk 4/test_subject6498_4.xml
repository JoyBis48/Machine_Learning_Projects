	<TEXT> I hate theories about Jon or Daenerys turning to the dark side. 

I mean, I guess it really would fit George's unexpected twists, but I want my heros I've been rooting for, for 5 years now to fulfill their destinies.

Hoping for Stannis turning instead. Now that would be awesome.

	<TEXT> I have a feeling that most people interpret Ice as a ceremonial blade only used for executions which I believe is not the case.

And someone please correct me if you have more facts, but Ice was the sword of the Lord of Winterfell, and has been so for thousands of years (new editions coming along every once in a while).

That means if he was going somewhere where he would bring a weapon. He would bring Ice.

Every year from November to Mars, Japanese "fishermen" gather in great numbers trapping hundreds of dolphins in a bay, capturing the beautiful for aquariums and killing the rest for meat. Which are served for example in schools... Watch "The Cove".

	<TEXT> **I have posted it,** and It's based upon Bran's dying wish to be a Knight, his probable highly magical powers and a line from Dunk and Egg 2. Dunk tells the soldier farmers to return to their homes against their Lords will saying: *"It was if some God had put the words in my mouth, not the warrior"* 

With the theory of Hodor being an ancestor to Dunk going hand in hand with this since Bran can Warg Hodor. 
Also, why begin a short story series along with your main story novels if the events weren't tightly linked and important to the whole plot. Oh, and George love Knights. Check his website.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I am relistening to Clash of Kings, keeping an ear out for good foreshadowing. Some of them are pretty obvious once you know what's going on.

When Jon is about to chop Ygritte's head off George has planted some real obvious foreshadowing for R+L=J 

 nbsp;

*"He raised Longclaw over his head, both hands tight around the grip. One cut, with all my weight behind it. He could give her a quick clean death, at least. He was his fathers son. Wasnt he? Wasnt he?"*

**Two times?** That's bold of GRRM I would say. It should stand out, but it really don't if you aren't looking for it.

 nbsp;

There's also one in A Storm of Swords where Sandor Clegane to Arya riding towards The Twins is also has a witty red wedding foreshadowing that is pretty well known


*"Keep your mouth shut and do as I tell you, and maybe well even be in time for your uncles bloody wedding.*

 nbsp;

**Anyone else know a witty and/or really obvious foreshadowing that has or hasn't struck true yet?** </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think we are going to get the novellas and the main series tightly linked together in the future with the help of Bran. 

GRRM began writing about Dunk about the same time as Clash of Kings came out. There is probably some reason for him writing two stories in the same universe parallel to each other yet to be revealed. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> IF Bran is controlling Coldhands from the future. I must say my own theory of Bran somehow interfering with **Dunk** becomes stronger rooted. My biggest concern was if it was possible to warg something in the past.

Considering Bran has had a year or two practicing on Dunk's supposed great grandson I am now nearly fully convinced.

If you disagree, read my flair. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The Wolf Hall-post got me thinking. Game of Thrones has some of Great Britains most talented actors. Harry Lloyd is one of my favourite Brits, and should have been nominated for supporting role in "The Theory of Everything" if you ask me. I loved him in Doctor Who, a show that has a great many guest actors that stars in A Game of Thrones which I will list below. Tell me if I forgot someone.

 nbsp;

Tobias Menzies and Liam Cunningham are russian submariners.

Joe Dempsie - Gendry

Harry Lloyd - Viserys

David Bradley - Walder Frey is in Doctor Who and also plays William Hartnell (#1 Doctor) in the movie "An Adventure of Space and Time".

Iain Glenn - Jorah the Andal)

Thomas Brodie-Sangster - Jojen

Diana Rigg - Queen of Thorns

Julian Glover - Pycelle

Jamie Sives, Ron Donachie and Ian Hanmore was all in the same episode "Tooth and Claw".

Lucian Msamati - Salladhor Saan

Mark Killeen - Mero

Spencer Wilding - A White Walker who has played aliens several times in Doctor Who

Tim Plester - Black Walder Rivers

Finn Jones (Loras Tyrell) was in the spin-off The Sarah Jane Adventures

Burn Gorman (Karl Tanner) and Owen Teale (Alliser Thorne) was in the spin-off Torchwood

Donald Sumpter (Maester Luwin) and Julian Glover was in the old Who-series

 nbsp;

**Rose Leslie** has a role in the season 1 of Downton Abbey where she is great.

Any other show or film where an actor from "Thrones" is particularly *shiny*? </TEXT>
