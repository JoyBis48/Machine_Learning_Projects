	<TEXT> Its actually a mix between two colors: Revlon colorstay matte balm in the colors Audacious and Showy. I put Audacious on over Showy to make a pinky-coral. And I got it dyed professionally the first time, but I used L'oreal Hi-Color Hilights in Red, which is the same color as the salon color, and I continue to use that on my roots. But when I touch up the middle and ends of my hair I use Beyond the Color Zone in Wild Red! Hope that helps! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I kind of do a combination of both? Haha. If you're going to do the wiggle, do it right at the root of your lashes and then swipe the rest of the way up. I find that way works best for me. And if you want added length, what I do is close my eye and put some mascara just at the tips so it really builds at the ends instead of building thicker in the middle. Hope that helps! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Wow, this is absolutely gorgeous! I love that lip color on you. I would say that if you want your features to stand out more in pictures, you might wanna turn up the drama on your eyes so that your beautiful features don't get lost in the distance! Perhaps that's not the look you want to go for, but that's what I would recommend. :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was going through these contests with my friends and your Disney one totally caught our eye! They urged me to do an Ariel inspired look, since my hair is bright red, and I've absolutely loved the movie since I was a child. I hope that everything goes okay at the hospital! Enjoy!  http://imgur.com/a/ccX3J#0

Edit: Totally sorry for the potato quality. I dont have a real camera lol. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think your eyebrows are gorgeous. Your eyes and lip color are also very pretty, but I think that if youre going to have super sparkly bold eyes like that, you need to balance them out with a more nude lip color, and if youre going to go with the bold lip color, a more neutral eye look would do best. Right now the colors are kind of taking over your face rather than enhancing it. My rule is that I pick one thing about my face I want to show off that day and enhance it,
