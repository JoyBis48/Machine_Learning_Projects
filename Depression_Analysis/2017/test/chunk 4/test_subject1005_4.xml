	<TEXT> I never worked in a video store, but when I was a kid, I was obsessed with Heather Graham. I used to banter with the guys who worked there who told me she was in the movie "The Great Outdoors." I knew he was wrong, so I bet him she wasn't in it. I'd give him five bucks if she was or get the movie "Pay Back" starring Mel Gibson on VHS for free if she wasn't. I got to take "Pay Back" home with me that day. That's the extent of my Blockbuster stories.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Armageddon is hated by most because of the scientific inaccuracies. I'll take the experts' word for it, but it doesn't change the fact that it has great lines, great characters and a fun plot. It is not my favorite movie, but if you start complaining about the accuracy of this movie's elements, then you might as well discredit every movie because I'm sure you can find a bullshit in every single one.   </TEXT>
