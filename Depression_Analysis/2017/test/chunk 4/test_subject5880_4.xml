	<TEXT> Nicotine will have a peppery / acid reflux type burn feeling on the airways. 24mg was more suited for cheap ego type batteries and clearomizers back in the day - something that produces less vapor in each drag. With that high powered of a setup, you'd probably be good at 12mg/ml. If that is still too rough, try getting an Eliquid that has more VG than PG. Vg is a thicker   smoother liquid, while PG supplies the throat hit.  </TEXT>

The experiment uses:

Three blu eCigs products (approximately 50% of the US market) and two SKYCIG products (approximately 30% of the UK market) were chosen for evaluation. Marlboro Gold Box (US), and Lambert   Butler Original and Menthol products (UK),

Not really relevant to our products, but good for their marketing and FDA approval.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Question about the release date for the iStick 50w </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-02-12 23:40:32 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So we've seen that the iStick 50w has seen some massive delays, from Jan 26th to possibly early March. 

However, on /r/electronic_cigarette, I've discovered that a [few people](http://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/2vnplb/my_mvp_20_died_after_one_year_of_solid_vaping_i/cojjuk6), one who even ordered just 2 days ago, already have the iStick 50w in hand, from [vapeNW](http://vapenw.com/istick-50w-by-eleaf). [Eciggity](http://www.eciggity.com/eleaf-istick-50w-battery/) also has them in stock, as does [OriginVape](https://originvape.com/product/eleaf-istick-50w/). 

Is there any update to the date that we should expect our iStick 50w's? I was sort of expecting that through this group-buy we'd be some of the first to get the product - but it's already on shelves elsewhere. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The film on my car is so bad that at night, all of my windows and the windshield freeze on the inside. Even driving for 40 minutes with the defroster on full blast will not remove the frozen film. When it's not that cold out, my windows are constantly fogged up - even in the rear. I never vape with closed windows - the drivers side window is always open no matter how cold, and the defroster is permanently on in my car while driving. I took rags with rubbing alcohol and windex out to rub all my glass down, but no success.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not weird at all, my friend. That's why it's growing exponentially in popularity. If you feel interested in looking for a setup, you can let me know, or check out /r/electronic_cigarette (hit or miss nowadays). I've done quite a bit of research on electronic cigarettes, and from what I've seen from the data, its a much healthier alternative. My bronchi tells me otherwise after about a year and a half, but I have yet to prove that it's due to vaping, and it seems to be a very isolated experience that I'm having. 

It IS, however, trading an addiction for another if you choose to use nicotine(all Eliquids also come in nicotine free versions!) - but I truly enjoy it and it's a much more manageable addiction due to the ability to fully customize your nicotine intake.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> if you have too much, you'll just feel uncomfortable for a couple hours. 

Depends on the person. As someone who used to struggle with an anxiety disorder, I actually managed to have a really bad trip that screwed me up for quite some time. 

About 50% of my trips would be bad, the longest being 3.5 hours. Actually tried ending my life the next day. 

Now I'm all good though. Blaze on.

	<TEXT> Great question. I was thinking about asking the same one. It's always funny hearing a commercial start off, "I'm raising money" and then immediately go to the next commercial. Kinda just like, oh, that's nice. 

Hope this gets answered. My only idea is that the company stopped paying the channel and this is a legal way for the channel or TV provider to require the company to keep paying without actually/fully advertising for them. Just a guess.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What I did is just cut up a tiny bit of my pill and take it whenever the zaps were too hard to handle. I came off of 300mg of [effexor] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=antidepressant+with+worst+withdrawal oq=antidepressant+with+worst+withdrawal+ aqs=chrome..69i57.8407j0j4 sourceid=chrome-mobile espv=1 ie=UTF-8) very very quickly and this method was very effective for me. Effexor also has a very short half life so it killed the withdrawals quickly, so it might be different in your situation.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The problem with the original istick 20w is that it will only fire coils whose resistance measures out to equal to or greater than 1 ohm. If it's anything like my 12w MVP v2.0, it isn't powerful enough to fire dual coils, either. Another person recommended the istick 50w. They are expected to be released in late February or early March, but their release has already been delayed twice. I'm still getting one, but just be ready for a wait. I would not recommend a aspire Cf subohm battery to replace the istick, as they are not similar in any way. The aspire battery has one button to push to fire, no variable voltage. It's like a beginners mechanical mod, essentially. 

I think the istick 50w IS going to be great, and I recommend waiting for it if you have the patience, unless you can trade in your 20w istick for the newer 30w which fires sub ohm coils. 

If you like the idea of a Lemo drop on a 30w istick, my friend just purchased this setup and I can send you pictures of how the tank fits on the istick. They are made by the same company, designed for the istick, so it should look good.  </TEXT>
