	<TEXT> I worked at best buy, and frequently felt morally obligated to tell people to go to newegg or equivalent to find their hdmi cables. Best buy matches prices of stores like walmart anyway, so I'm going to guess that's why their stocks are declining. </TEXT>

Whenever I'd be out with friends, we would always park all of our cars as close to these guys as possible, while still remaining legally parked. Sometimes they couldn't get the car out without risking damaging our (crappy) cars, and literally had to wait for us to leave.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Back in the beta, I used to shoot out the lights in the subway train (like the ones in the last picture) just outside of the red-lit, raised service tunnel. I would lay there in the dark, then when the enemy would turn that corner I'd flip my flashlight on, blinding them by the drastic change in light, then annihilate them. Good times were had those days. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Gotcha. It's kind of a catch 22, because you really need to know her sense of humor well in order to put yourself in a position to get to know her better. If you said, "Hey, I wasn't sure if you got my message, but etc," it won't sound as good (funny) as if you said something like, "Hey [girlname], I was busy stalking your page the other day after we met and realized I really wanted to get to know you past what Facebook shows." Throw a smiley in or something. This worked for me, but my girlfriend has a stellar sense of humor, so as long as the girl you're going after would find that funny, go for it. Stay lighthearted and be confident that she'll laugh when you send it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you can be funny about it, there isn't a limit, but she may just be busy. Facebook makes stalking easy, since it now shows you if the other person has seen your message. Don't think she is ignoring you, be confident she just didn't get time to reply if anything. I think 48 hours is generally a good rule of thumb.

Btw, 10 hours ago was yesterday for you? Where do you live? 10 hours ago was this morning for me. haha </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey Bachenalien, ignore the nosey people who want to know about whatever the camp is. I can't imagine why they're so interested, but since you don't want it out there, it's none of their business.

Onto the girl, she likes you already. I have no idea what she is like, but you could try something forwardly cute. It's easy to message people on Facebook, so ask her to a movie. She'll likely be confused, so you then say that you'll both rent the same movie and start it at the same time, and you two will talk on the phone while it's going. **Ask her for her number then** and you can have a sweet, long distance date that way. You have her number, she'll hopefully like the gesture, and you can go from there.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Play either Brotherhood or Revelations. Brotherhood was my favorite. It has the best mechanics out of all the games (though AC2, AC:B, and AC:R are all basically the same). If you're playing one to get up to speed on the game before 3, I would play Revelations, obviously. It's the last in line so far. I suggest you play all of them if you ever get around to it. They're all great games. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Hey r/cars. I need advice about buying the right car, and the internet outside of reddit cannot be trusted. </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> **My short background:** I don't know much about cars. I've driven my mother's hand-me-down Mazda MPV since I could drive at 15 (I'm 20). My favorite car used to be the RX-8 but a friend of mine got one and he was kind enough to update the world with every problem he ever had with the car, which was just about daily. Even driving the way I do, easy on the car, that car seems too much of a hassle.

**Current situation:** I'm looking to buy a car in the near future, as the radiator in my van has a life-ending crack in it and is out of commission. We could easily replace that, but it doesn't seem worth it. So my plan is to purchase a new car. I just need to make the decision on appearance or fuel economy.

I am a fan of the newer Camaros, but I'm on the fence about getting one or some really great Hybrid car. I've heard hybrids aren't worth it for numerous reasons, but I want Reddit's opinion. I wouldn't be driving the Camaro like a racecar, I just love the appearance of it. I feel like it would be a better decision to get a car with great MPG. If the hybrids aren't worth it because of their downsides I'll probably stick to the Camaro. If I'm getting a car for MPG then the appearance isn't that big of a deal. Advice?

**TL;DR** Need a new car, are hybrids actually as good as they're hyped to be, or should I stick with something I like to look at, like a Camaro? </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> There is a martial arts movie I'm trying to find the name of. A friend of mine is trying to find it again but she can only remember some of it. Apparently every scene has a color scheme, where all the fighters wear the same colors as the background. She says it's extremely vivid and colorful. Like the background will literally be made up of a sea of yellow flowers while the martial artists will be wearing all yellow robes. I know that's not much to go off of, but she said most of the scenes in the movie are like that, which should pretty much give away the movie if anyone has seen it. I have no idea how old the movie is. If anyone can help me figure this out I will forever be grateful. Thanks! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ladies, I'm in a similar situation as Brrring. I doubt he meant it that way. I met a girl and thought she was literally my age (20) while she is actually 28. I had no idea. It's not a jump from youth to old age, it's more of a jump from college-age girl beauty to young adult beauty. There is a difference, but it's hard to explain, and neither is less beautiful than the other. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I just learned the other day from one of my BEST friends, that back before he met me, when he was engaged to my other best friend, that when she invited him to one of my band's concerts, he would record us playing, and post the recordings to Youtube under the title, "Worst band in recorded history." Had I known at the time, I would have hated him. Since then I have met him, and obviously become good enough friends that he felt comfortable divulging that piece of hilarious information. I now know that our band was pretty awful back then, so I just laugh now knowing that. Anyone have a similar story, where you laugh at something hurtful in the past? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You're actually quite wrong. I was a server, and my wage was $2.15 an hour, but if I didn't make at least minimum wage they *did not* make up the difference.

And if you think washing dishes or cooking food is more difficult than being a server you are dead wrong. Serving is one of the hardest jobs. You can't really know how truly awful it is until you've been a server. I would work 12 hour days without enough time for a break or lunch, constantly on my feet moving throughout the restaurant serving six or more tables at any given time. When it gets that busy, people get irate because they don't get served in time. The servers' job is not only to carry plates. You have to keep a lot of people happy, keep their drinks filled, check to make sure they have everything they need at basically any given moment during their meal.

You're absolutely insane if you think servers get paid too much. Please, *try* to be a server for a month and you'll completely change your mind. </TEXT>
