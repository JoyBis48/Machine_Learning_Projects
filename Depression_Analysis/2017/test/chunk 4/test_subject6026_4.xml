	<TITLE> Just some questions about the New 3dsXL trade in offer at gamestop. </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I was wondering if I needed my serial code on the back of my 3ds to still trade it in. After a long time it came off of course. I remember trying to trade in my old DS lite before and gamestop didn't let me because the serial code was gone. I was also wondering how much money is knocked off if you don't turn it in with the charger. </TEXT>
