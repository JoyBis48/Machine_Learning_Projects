	<TEXT> While Tanking during Titan EX with my FC, getting repeatedly blasted off the platform by Landslide. Needless to say, my FC thought it was hilarious as I screamed myself into oblivion on Mumble every time.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes, welcome to Final Fantasy! :D My first month wasn't as progressive as I have college and work, but I do enjoy what time I can spend in Eorzea. :)  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I absolutely hate speedrunning and will refuse to do it unless I'm partying with people that I am friends with. I like enjoying the dungeon for what it is regardless of how many times I have to run through it (unless it's AV. Fuck that place).  Granted, I understand people's want for speedruning, but I don't enjoy the process of speeding through something.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I play through Steam often, and the Mog Station simply registers your copy of the game under Windows. If you purchase the game through the Steam client,  it should give you a CD key that you affiliate with your SQ account in order to lock it to that account. 
As for buying time,  you can just pay though a credit/debit  card through the Mog Station as well. You should be able to redeem your time card in the same fashion. Purchasing a copy of the game would be necessary though,  as others have said.  </TEXT>
