	<TEXT> I had sociology last semester and there is a word for this. If I remember correctly it's called the second shift. Women who work are still expected to do the cooking and cleaning and laundry and child rearing. Men often cook maybe once a week on a grill and have a Saturday chore of mowing the lawn and washing the car.  </TEXT>

I think you give really good advice. Even though they are connected, the three are separate issues. Damage control seems to only be possible if we are honest and explain all of it to the family members. My wife plans to deal with her sister after she gives birth. This isn't the first time her sister has done things like this but for us it will be the last. My wife intends to pretty much go no contact with her sister except in regards to her nephew. It is for the best if I don't talk to the sister in law because my anger and hatred will explode and then her father will get involved and it will be ugly as ever.  </TEXT>

She doesn't want to be around her father at all so she doesn't want to go, but she is a people pleaser and doesn't want to disrupt the family. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Her family is kind of crazy. She has a 37 year old uncle who walks past me and ignores me at family functions. His wife also will only give me dirty looks or talk about her dog. This stupid, immature behavior is the kind of thing I experience every time I'm around them. 

The wedding happened so fast. We went from being in a long term committed relationship to being married in 6 weeks, not even really having an engagement. Since it happened so fast, we didn't get much time to think about who to invite and we decided that no one in my wife's family needed to know besides her mother and four younger sisters. The other family members live far away and we felt that asking them to take a day off of work to drive several hours for a wedding that was mostly just for legal purposes was pointless and unfair, especially since we will be having a big wedding in a year. 

When her cousin asked, we didn't know she knew and assumed it was confusion since it was asked in such a way that that made sense. We were maintaining what we thought they all knew as the truth. 

Our omission was meant to save feelings and avoid hurting people. We also felt that, if we chose to share it, doing so at her other cousin's wedding was not the place. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My wife and I have been married for four months and together four and a half years. We had just begun planning our wedding when we found out that she was set to lose her financial aid for school. We talked to my parents and her mom and they all understood that unless we got married, my wife had to drop out. We didn't want anyone to know since it happened really fast and we couldn't afford to invite anyone. It was in the middle of the day on a Wednesday so no one could have really made it anyway. In an effort to avoid hurt feelings we only had our immediate families there. We put on Facebook that we were engaged.

My wife's sister, who was 18 and pregnant at the time, instead scheduled a doctors appointment and skipped her sister's wedding. She has tried to sabotage our relationship from the beginning; she has told both of my wife's parents terrible lies about me and has even physically attacked me before. She only knew we were getting married because she lived with my wife's mom at the time. 

My wife's cousin got married this weekend and we were asked by her other cousin if we were married. We said no, as that is what we agreed upon. We found out that her sister told the family that we are in fact married. I am livid. It was not her place to do that and I'm tired of her invading my life whenever she can. My wife's father, who abused my wife and I in the past, was also not supposed to know, but we are sure she told him as well.

She is being induced this Wednesday and I have made it clear that I will not be driving two hours to her father's house to see her. My mother in law is angry that I won't do this but I can't stand my father in law or sister in law. My wife agrees but doesn't want trouble. What should I do?

Tl;dr: sister in law is an asshole and I'm expected to coddle her. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I live a few hours from Philly, where the Mazzoni(sp?) center is, which is where most of my friends got their T. I keep thinking about using some of this money to do that, but I didn't think I wanted hormones right now. 

I have round about discussed being trans with my mom and she is 100% not on board. My dad makes comments about transpeople that say he is the same. My wife would be fine with it, as we have discussed it at length, but we currently live with my parents. 

I'm just really not sure where I am right now on all of this and it sucks. I generally don't bother to bind because it doesn't really work anyway but when I do my dysphoria is all but gone. I am open with my whole family about the fact that top surgery is an inevitability and they all seem okay with it as I've explained it that my chest is too big, but a reduction can put me at higher risk for cancer so they're on board. 

I'm sorry if this is all over the place but any insight would help. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Disclaimer: I'm left than left and love Elizabeth Warren.

She is too left. Hillary is much more moderate and older, helping to secure votes. She is a known name and not for rocking the boat out right on things that people more right don't want rocked. Elizabeth Warren can't secure the votes because she is too young and too new and too left for the comfort of most. I also doubt that she will run and step on Hillary Clinton's toes to try to be the first female president, which I personally find admirable. If they both run, the right will construe it as a sexist cat fight and that will make them both lose. 

Personally, I'm voting for Hillary Clinton because I like her and what she stands for. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm a genderqueer lesbian, so my perspective is skewed, but here is how I see it:

Gay men, particularly masculine bear types on top; rather "normal" and the male privilege to boot. Feminine gay men are a close second.

Lesbians, femme on top with varying degrees of butch behind them. 

Then, we have branches. Transmen get male privilege when they pass but all the medical advances really give transwomen the privilege, so it is really about which matters more to the individual. As a whole, society doesn't love transpeople. 

Bi people fall within their respective gay/straight depending upon their relationship at the time, though they deal with erasure based on their relationships. If they are with someone they are immediately either gay or straight and whores if they are single or have multiple partners.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not a chart, but a summary. 

Everyone (gay and straight) call bi people whores, so they don't like anyone.

Lesbians don't like bi people because of too many "bi" girls who just want to experiment. This fuels bi hatred of lesbians because they claim it is "bi erasure".

Transpeople think that everyone hates them so they hate everyone first. Straight people think they are just really gay, gay people think gender and sexuality shouldn't be lumped.

Gay men hate more feminine gay men for being attention whores.

Lesbians don't like straight men because they feel objectified; straight men in turn feel that lesbians try to out-masculinize them. 

I think that's about it. </TEXT>
