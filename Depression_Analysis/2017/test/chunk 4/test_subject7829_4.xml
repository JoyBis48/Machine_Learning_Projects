	<TEXT> Not that I necessarily believe this "shipwrecked Indians" story, but is a canoe traversal from Greenland to Iceland, thence onwards to the Faroes or Orkneys and Scotland or Norway essentially impossible? Let's assume a well-stocked Inuit canoe that had just finished a large seal or walrus hunt was blown into the open ocean by a storm. They reach Iceland and then decide this was an intervention by "the gods" or something and decide to press on. Could they conceivably have survived and reached Europe? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have heard this theory, probably from the same TV show as the OP. The argument made by the documentary was that the symptoms of the Aztec plague did not match any known European disease. It's quite possible in my mind that, after being weakened by European diseases, native diseases that the Aztecs previously resisted spread and ended up finishing them off. 

However, the documentary focused solely on the Aztecs and not the wider downfall of the native civilizations in the new world. It is a known fact that a lot of them succumbed to smallpox and this is attested to by skeletal and DNA evidence. It was in part because this evidence was supposedly lacking with the Aztecs that the documentary made the argument that it did. They even had, if I remember correctly, some people on who claimed this disease spread back to Europe and was responsible for some of the later outbreaks of "plague" where the symptoms were quite different from those of the Black Death. </TEXT>

Not so much anymore. So many important functions have been privatized, at this point I think you can legitimately increase the scope of government without impinging on things that the private sector does better. Study after study, for instance, have shown that private "charter" schools perform worse than traditional public schools, despite the fact that charter schools can pick and choose their students. And of course the privatization of important security and military functions has been widely documented. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I second that recommendation. It's quite interesting how he maps out the process by which the ultra-religious society of the Middle Ages collapsed *from within*, not because of papal corruption or the rise of science as a rival doctrine per se, but more because the natural development of its own dogma led to unbearable contradictions and conflicts.

Seeing science as a natural offshoot of religion (study God by studying His creation), that eventually turned against its ideological "parent" is quite revealing. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's any object whose existence depends on the existence of another object. For example, a physical body's existence is conditioned upon the existence of the atmosphere, the sun, etc. Since there is always change in the Universe, all conditioned objects are linked together and are thus always changing and ceasing their present form without end.

An unconditioned object, by contrast, is a metaphysically necessary object. It *must* exist, and stands outside the chain of dependence and change. Various philosophical traditions have differing views on this object. Of course in the Christian tradition it is God, the Buddhists call it Nirvana, etc. Some philosophies deny that any such object exists. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yep, I came here to say this. But it goes back further, to the long Tokugawa peace, when the warriors of the previous age were romanticized. Ironically, when violence came back to Japan in the Bakumatsu and the Boshin War, a lot of the combat actually took on the highly stylized "chivalric" character that the combatants *imagined* was how the Samurai fought pre-1600.

Legend became reality, and that continued right up through how the Japanese fought in WWII (courageously, but recklessly.) To take one example, Japanese fighter pilots were known to hold *live duels* with each other in their planes, sometimes even shooting each other down. This was tolerated by commanders as part of the "warrior spirit." Combat discipline was a huge problem in the Japanese Army in the pacific theater. Troops would charge when ordered not to, and would refuse to retreat to more defensible positions when ordered to do so. One cannot imagine Ieyasu or any other actual samurai-era commander condoning such foolishness.

It is interesting to read the accounts of actual samurai who fought before the Tokugawa period. There are lots of passages like "we encountered the enemy, but they outnumbered us, so we ran away," and "we were paid off so we switched sides," not so much emphasis on suicidal charges and undying devotion to the Daimyo or the like (though these things did happen occasionally - every legend has a kernel of truth.) </TEXT>

The Religious Right have had their way bullying and silencing the rest of us for some time now, and if they're now getting fed a bit of their own medicine, well, turnabout is fair play. Facebook is not trivial - it's a major social forum these days, and if religious bigotry and ignorance goes unchallenged there,  that is a big deal.

However, that doesn't make Krauss someone who's actually had insights into fundamental ontology. He obviously hasn't, and to claim otherwise unfortunately weakens his political arguments, which I do by and large agree with. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sure, I know some old white guys like that - blacks are "fine in their own way" but their culture is too different from ours and it would be better if we just split up into separate countries. They even say they like Malcolm X and guys like that because they also have the same beliefs (blacks and whites should be separate.)

They are just trying to make their racism seem more politically correct in my mind. But if you actually take them at their word, how would this ever be done? Can you imagine the chaos? It would be like the India-Pakistan partition times a thousand. And there are too many mixed-race people now for it to ever be practical.

Also I can guess which "country" would end up with all the economic and military resources. It wouldn't be the new "Negrostan." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Agreed. Part of the problem is that "white" has always been defined negatively, that is, a "white" person was just someone who didn't fit into one of the more identifiable racial or ethnic groups. Might as well just call us "blank" people.

Another problem is that the "white" population in the US came from so many different European cultures that they really don't have that much of a common cultural background at all. Just like the Indian in the video who couldn't explain his culture as anything more than "dancing around a totem pole and stuff," what is "white" culture to the average American today, that is, culture that only "white" people can participate in and enjoy? NASCAR and Country Music? Hardly worth defending against some other culture or subculture that may be more appealing. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Google "Nazi Cultural Revolution." I think I'm remembering a proper book when it was just a review I read of "Werewolf!" plus some chat-board discussions.  

They're interesting nonetheless and would certainly make a great novel should someone choose to write one. Heck, I'll get us started:

Basically, Goebbels and the other surviving Nazis (with an ailing and increasingly demented Hitler in tow) carry out the "Alpine Redoubt" plan they were considering in 1945, and manage to spark a war between the US and the Soviets using false-flag attacks with the connivance of Patton and Churchill (both of whom considered an immediate attack on the Soviets in real life.) While the two former allies pummel each other, the Nazi Party is reconstructed along ultra-radical lines in rural Bavaria and Austria, paralleling Mao's Long March. The Party is toughened up, and (like Mao's forces), realizes that the total collapse of civilization is not enough to stop a determined group of radicals from seizing power. In fact, it rather helps things along.

Shadowy bankers from Switzerland cross the border into Nazi-held territory with gold and other resources for re-armament. Remnants of the Italian, Vichy French, and other fascists also make their way across the high passes of the Alps and join up with the Waffen SS. Ironically, the SS is now "multicultural" (this was happening to some degree in real life before the end of the war - they even had a Muslim battalion!). Some "adjustment" of racial views take place - success in battle is now evidence enough that you must have "Aryan" ancestry somewhere (Jews still need not apply, of course.)

In the chaos of the US-Soviet war, the Nazis manage to re-take a lot of their former territory and become a "Third Force" that neither the US or the Russians want to piss off for fear of putting the Nazis in the opposing camp. When peace finally arrives in late 1947 (Truman has threatened to nuke Moscow with his new long-range bombers), the Nazi regime is re-entrenched and there is no trust left among the former allies to take it down. Cynical politicians on both sides also see the advantage of a Central European "buffer state" between the American and Soviet Empires to keep border tensions down. The Holocaust is known about, but it is lost in the sea of the mass slaughter of an expanded and elongated World War II.

Hitler was already quite sick in 1945 and dies by 1950, succeeded by a triumvirate of Goering (who is also sickly and morbidly obese by this point), Bormann and Goebbels. Himmler defected to Sweden when all seemed lost in 1945 (his actual plan in real life) and is now a Trotsky-like figure. By the 1960's, the Reich has become a bizarre cross of Switzerland and North Korea, committed to neutrality but also ruled by a totalitarian political party which is armed to the teeth with some of the most advanced weaponry in the world.

By this point, Goebbels, always the master propagandist and politician, has pushed aside Bormann. Goering died in 1955, a 500-lb. monster, surrounded by harem girls and plundered art. Goebbels was always on the left-wing of the Party and wants to revive the "Socialist" in National Socialism. However, he faces strong opposition from conservative Christians and business interests who are now doing a booming trade with both the US and Soviet spheres. 

However, Goebbels has a potent weapon: A new generation of "Aryans," raised by the Hitler Youth and the "Lebensborn" movement. These cadres, now come of age, assail the conservatives and try to revive the dream of world conquest and the Master Race. They protest at Universities and party conventions, carrying their "little black books" - abridged copies of *Mein Kampf* of course. They occupy Albert Speer's grand buildings in Berlin and demand the downfall of the "bourgeois  Junkers" and the "foreign elements" within the Waffen SS. The rest of the world grows nervous that World War III is about to begin...

take it from there!

	<TEXT> Yes, I know he did a lot of that early on in his rule. I'm more thinking of later on, the Great Terror and later, all the people who died shouting "long live Stalin!" and actually meant it. Did Stalin think those people had secretly betrayed him (clinical paranoia), or was he killing people he knew to be loyal for some other reason? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Interesting question. I may take heat for this, but there are a lot of similarities between Hitler's expansion towards the East and the genocide of the Native Americans in the US. Indeed Hitler thought of the two as similar and used that to morally justify his invasions. See the book *The Wages of Destruction* for a good discussion of this.

Science in Nazi Germany was highly politicized. Anyone who didn't get on the mythical "Aryan" bandwagon was sacked or worse. In a scenario where Hitler "won" the war - not necessarily conquer the world, just survive as a regime into the 1950's or 60's, I don't see this really changing.

Most people who have thought through "Alternate Histories" about a postwar Nazi regime see the main threat coming from even more radical Nazis - the pagan/mystical SS clashing with the more Christian "preserve traditional German values" crowd. There was a great book a while back, can't remember the title, that was set during a Nazi "Cultural Revolution" during the 60's where radical ultra-Aryan students "assaulted the party" for its conservatism under the direction of a new Fuhrer who took over after Hitler's death.

In short, no, I think the Nazi ideology was too extreme to ever moderate like the American "manifest destiny" ideology eventually did. Instead it would probably have turned inward on itself and collapsed in a series of purges and crazy attempts to resurrect Atlantis (Thule) or genetically engineer Aryan supermen or some such craziness. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Interesting, I am not really familiar with model theory. I am confused as to how if you only have the symbols 0,1,+,x,, how you can get anything other than whole numbers anyway. 

Even if you add Z to that list, I assume it is a Boolean function of some kind, telling you if a number is an integer or not? Wouldn't any number still come out to be an integer if you only have 0, 1,+ and * to work with to make other numbers? (I am assuming you mean "x" to be multiply, not a variable name.) </TEXT>
