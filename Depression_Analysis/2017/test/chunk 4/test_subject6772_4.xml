	<TEXT> Do whites treat other whites poorly at times? Do they discriminate against other whites (like Irish, etc)?

Weird how this works. Some just assume all blacks see all other blacks as the same but when it comes to whites they don't expect that. 

Does it help to be better represented when it comes to race, class, etc and so on? I would say it does. Does that automatically solve all the problems in the system? I would say it doesn't.

So you can have a legit gripe about being represented on X but that doesn't always lead to Y and Z. 

The right only hears one thing when it comes to this issue. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's cute. The idea is that government employees are abusing power (like the right complains about with Obama, but didn't with bush...weird. Anyway,) and have been doing so and getting away with it.

The justice system favors some over others. A point the people were protesting about. I don't think people were complaining that those who were abusing power were all white, but were all in a position of power.

Now...are blacks sentenced, arrested, charged, pulled over, etc in a disproportionate amount? If so - isn't that something worth looking at? Does it matter who does it? 

Weren't white people (jews/pols/gays/etc) killed by other whites in ww2? Are you saying that if they complained they were being targeted that they had no case because they were all white?

Classicism, etc, are all real problems. But leave it to someone to ignorantly yell "There are some black cops, so all is ok! Git r done buddies!" </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When people are used to being abused by cops - either unwarranted stops, searches, etc - they might just have a case for avoiding them quickly. 

Waco and Ruby Ridge - why didn't people just obey the cops? Bundy Ranch - why didn't they guy just pay the fine, why did so many show up with guns?

The right seems to have no problem in justifying their distrust of government but when others do it they suddenly get all weird. You watch the protests? When cops were approaching many people ran - why didn't the cops just beat em and shoot em? Maybe because they knew it was wrong...when the cameras were rolling. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The blame I see has more than one facet.

The war on (some) drugs. Targeting areas, using tickets/etc as a revenue source, and so on. 

As I said before, I can blame individuals and the system. I can't fix individuals, but we can work and fix the system and the people we pay to manage that system.

Not in favor of the riot side, but large protests and stuff do seem to get the message out. Think about the 60's and civil rights and vietnam. 

That does not mean I can't try to understand why people do what they do (even if I don't agree with their actions). Simply dismissing things as people being hoods/thugs/etc is easy but ignores underlying causes.

It is like how the right says "Muslims over there in the middle east are bad, do bad things, and hate us fer our freedoms! Git R Done!" and don't stop to think for a minute about the causes behind some of the things - like us overthrowing their leaders, etc.

Simple minded people see simple minded solutions. They usually watch fox and listen to rush who play to that. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So many things work well in theory that don't in reality.

Let's look at ole bush. Torture happens, he skates. Cheney shoots some guy in the face, meh. 

Big companies screw the country and get bailouts. Companies contribute to deaths, basically steal from people, etc and pay a small fine.

All things people have exposed and the justice system ignores. What was is the conservatives have been saying since 2008? Something about the tree of liberty, etc....

You think the people in Ferguson hadn't been trying to make changes for years? It took the protests to get real reports on the corruption and change to start.

The people in power (and those with money) have to have the will to change things. They get lazy and comfortable until some things wake them up.

Ferguson and Baltimore both got people talking about issues they generally ignore - which is weird because we have so many 24x7 news stations. Politicians can get elected and try to do something, but then party politics take over and legislation and funding go nowhere. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am not interested in individuals and their personal problems - from what crimes they have done to anything else.

People in government with power that abuse it, though, is something we should care about and can do something about. We pay them, they work for us. 

Cops are to protect/serve. When cops fail at that we should come down on them for failing to do their job. I would think conservatives would be all for that.

When you have a system that is a mess we should be outraged. The justice system screws over people daily. That is part of why the US has more people in prison than other countries. People on the right tend not to pay attention to this (in fact, they see a way to make money from it with private prisons/etc).

Their usual solutions are things like "get a job", "more prayer in schools" and so on. All because those things require no thinking. The deep issues that exist get glossed over and ignored in favor of what people see in a rather twisted light "I haven't been arrested, beaten, screwed over by the system - so you can avoid it to if you act like me!"

And what that is your solution - you haven't seen the real problem at all. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You keep saying "dem/republican".

There are plenty of people in both parties who lean conservative or liberal on some issues. I am talking about core values - not party.

*I think the real problem is lack of police training/internal controls and the culture that lets them think they could get away with arresting someone without cause and then intentionally not putting a seatbelt on the guy.*

As a former LEO I can tell you that is, indeed, a problem. That problem gets exacerbated by the the entire justice system - but yes, it starts with the cops IMHO (not always).

When people in a certain area are targeted for enforcement than in other areas you get a lot more 'crime' suddenly. Jay walking, riding a bike with no helmet, 'speeding/distracted driving/rolling stops' etc and so on.

Those people now have to take time from work for court, pay more fines, etc than people in other areas. All the while other people do the same and get ignored - and then those people point to those other areas/people start to get biased and demand more police to bust more people. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As expected people totally miss it. 

Cons are rushing to push the whole meme "It's a dem city, so we don't expect there would be social issues" which is kind of funny when you think about it....

The two groups look at the issue in a different way. I don't care the politics of the city. People in power in either party can, and do abuse power. So this isn't about party politics but about perception of real issues.

Conservatives blow off those who have regular problems and side with those in government and stand up for them (unless, of course, it's that one guy in Office, Obama). They blame the victims of government power abuse and incompetence.

Liberals tend to see the issue as something that is fundamentally wrong with the system and how it works, while also saying if someone did something wrong they should be held accountable. But many aren't because they aren't poor, minority, etc. 

I would think the right would care about unequal justice and abuse of the system against the citizens. But they keep proving me wrong by siding against the people they don't like and patting those doing the abuse on the back.

Pretend like it was obama making the arrest and someone dying. Issa/Gowdy would do 15 investigations, fox would carry it 24x7 and demand justice. </TEXT>

There were breaking points. The right is quick, especially now, to dismiss and use Ferguson to say "See, there wasn't any issue at all!" when the point protestors were making is crap happens every damned day.

Sure, some of it is small (being harassed, pulled over a lot, etc by cops). But some is larger. Extra charges tacked on, unequal protection and so on.

Conservatives tend to only care about a few big incidents ignoring the elephant in the room. </TEXT>

People who generally ignore the plight of people who have complained for decades about problems with the justice will suddenly pay attention and find fault it in .

When it's blacks, indians, hispanics, poor people getting screwed over every single day they just shrug and tell em "If you wouldn't have got arrested you wouldn't be in this situation, obey the law, get a job, etc"

Sure as hell though when one of said group are unarmed and die by cop they are out there setting up gofundme's for the cop(s), raging out injustice etc.

	<TEXT> I can hear conservatives across the country saying that now.

All the while they have ignored this as a real problem in some communities for years and told people to quit whining about it.

Suddenly though, they seem critical of a system.

Funny how that works. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It goes like this. There were several investigations done that found nothing. Then there is another investigation that drags on and you want it to drag on more, so you order those other documents to slow things down.

Imagine if 9/11/2001 were investigated like this, it would still be going on. Some things would be classified, then there would be court battles over a few of them, they get released, then more and and when it's all done there is another investigation just for the hell of it and you slowly ask for all that same documentation as before *and* new docs to explore what people said about those other docs later...

It's like the never ending story. Well...until the election. Then suddenly it will wrap up with what we learned the first time. </TEXT>

It makes them feel better and not alone in their psychosis. It's not just them as individuals believing the poor people are destroying America by asking for help with food and medical care, they have people in office that whisper to them. Now they aren't alone in the things they imagine. </TEXT>

*In August, his boss is shutting down Z Pizza and putting him and his 11 co-workers out of work.*

And then.... *So she has to give raises within the next two years.*

So what it seems like to me is that the owner is using this as an excuse. Funny how the right ditches analysis and such in cases like this.

But, hey, conservatives go for emotion because they are always lacking on facts (how did that whole 'Obama ordered a stand down with Benghazi' work out for you?? Ohhh...right.) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My personal take on it:

Obi Wan was there to look after Luke on Tatooine and set him on his path/protect him. By dying here he was able to better aid Luke now in the long term and continue his mission. 

Both he and Luke now progressed and Vader was under the impression that the last of the Jedi's was gone, which upped his arrogance that it was just he, the emperor, and the empire. Yoda was surely too old and probably dead, Obi Wan gone, there was no one left to teach, so his guard on that front would be down.

Again, just my guess :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Cool. Thanks for the answer. One more Q? If you were to recommend a service to someone outside your coverage area what would you recommend and barring that what would you personally suggest what sort of things would you tell people to look for/against?

Not in the market myself but eventually might be when I move in a few years. I am just not overly trusting of alarm companies (no rational reason off the top of my head, just one of them things). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Let me guess. You're a conservative. Now, now, don't clap, it wasn't hard to figure out. Take something that someone didn't say, pretend they did, and presto - you have something you can try to use to bolster an argument you know you will lose if you don't (welfare/dependency). 

Now, one could note the year of the article, 2011. Which means you are probably just trolling for comments (another sign of a conservative who can't win arguments).

But hey, carry on, fun to see cons squirming and twisting. Makes me all happy :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> "Amid mounting political pressure, the ATF last month put the bullet ban on the back burner, but left the door open for future rule-making."

Um, was there a way to 'close the door'? If not then they didn't leave the door open they just didn't decide at this time to do it.

Against the ban myself. Since most crimes involving the shooting of cops aren't planned and arise out of circumstance I don't think there is much basis to ban these because of cops. If someone is planning on killing a cop, any old bullet would do if you plan it out. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So what? According to conservatives all you have to do is work harder. Sure, you might work 2 or 3 jobs, but if you aren't getting all you want in life from work that is your fault.

And now someone is trying to blame, what, blame immigrants? LOL. Ok.

Remember when republicans voted against an extension for unemployment benefits? They said aid to those unemployed made them lazy and if they cut aid those lazy people would get jobs?

According to them there are tons of jobs out there. And the only reason your income is dropping is you are lazy and you aren't training yourself for new jobs.

And now they are trying to blame immigrants?? Yeah...get your message straight. </TEXT>
