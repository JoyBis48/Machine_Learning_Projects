	<TEXT> It's not about sentence structure, it's using the correct words and grammar. Which to me is very important.

Saying "hung" instead of "hanged," to me at least, is like saying "brung" instead of "brought." </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  it's not art

It's a bold statement to make. It has been made about many things that we now revere. I don't want to get into an argument about it or anything, it's just a nice sentiment about being human... You are making a universal claim, and it holds true right now. I mean, it really does for the most part. But who knows, couple years down the line and "OppoQuinn, you're just like the people who didn't want robots to have equal rights! God! I HATE YOU!" </TEXT>

	<TEXT> an honest question:

Why do you want to pay for something that should be learned through hard work on your behalf? There are many free -- not in the sense of dumbed down articles and tutorials -- resources on the web and in books (not actually free). 

The reason I ask is because I'm just assuming that you do not trust the reputation of free information, but realize that I could be wrong.

Seriously though, if you're looking for a way to learn web design my best advice would be to not pay for it with money! Work on building a portfolio of work that you have invested your hard work and time, which in the end is much more valuable. No paid courses are necessarily going to get you there faster. Just tinker, receive criticism, and tinker more.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Now this is one of the really tough questions. The reason is because "the greater good" is really loosely defined. It could mean simply "the greatest amount of people unharmed", it could be used to imply some sort of "universalize goodness," or perhaps other more specific definitions for deciphering the greatest good, beliefs of what that is, and what is actually happening in reality.

There is no real answer, of course. Unless you believe in some sort of system of truth that exists independently of the world. </TEXT>

In order for toast to levitate, you need to refrain from buttering either side. Because of the same quantum factors as above, there is an inverse property which causes the chances of it landing face down to become -50%, or in other words, floating. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I wasn't trying to argue with him. I was just pointing out that his remarks sounded like something a child would say.

But I have an honest question for you. How old are you? Please don't think I'm looking to make an ageist argument here, I'm just curious. I'm 25, and have been out of college for a little while now. And the one thing I regret is not spending more time focused on studies. I honestly think that I was too immature to start my studies in the first place. And I guess my point is this,

College helped me grow up. It allowed me to become independent, get lots of new interests, learn romantic relationships, make big mistakes (and recover from them), etc.

I think it's very important to acquire this kind of culture, and it's almost tragic that collage/university study has become the medium for which most kids in the US go about getting them.

Being truly self sufficient and supporting yourself financially is when these lessons really happen. College should be about improving upon whatever skill set you desire to improve on, so that you are more prepared when real life happens.
