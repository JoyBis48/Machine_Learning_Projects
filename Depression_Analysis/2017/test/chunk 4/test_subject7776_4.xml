	<TEXT> I'm not good with words, but if you need anything, I'm here. I can get you a card and stuff.

Live for your children. You wouldn't want their Christmas gift to be a permanent scar on their minds. Love works as a gift, kisses and hugs, homemade things.

I'm not an adult so I don't have adult ideas on what to do, but If you need money to get them something small I'm totally game for sharing some of my money.

I'm sorry this year wasn't the best for you. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Damn, I'm stupid haha, I read the first sentence wrong.
I know it's not all fun, there are long hours, bad pay, conditions can be shit. I understand its not all GUNS, 'MERICA, 'SPLOSIONS, or fun.
Drill instructors will yell/scream at you for every little thing you do wrong and how you talk.
Which I think is a good thing, I need a new experience, and learn how to get over things, or I'm never going to.
I just feel like it'd be nice to fight for the person next to you instead of yourself, for once.

Maybe I'm thinking about it wrong, or what not, anyways, sorry if my post didn't make any sense last night. That is my bad! :P </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Luckily you didn't get prescribed anything (I think), haha, but to me it shouldn't matter if I can take the meds after, cause one thing that makes me feel better is exercise and you have to stay fit to be a Marine so maybe I'll get a lot better if I get in.
Thanks man. </TEXT>

I want to learn skills about how I should go about being a leader, and the bonds you make with the men next to you.

	<TEXT> Yeah, I had no idea it was a big deal until he said that I can't join and that no one will take me for a year.
I had to go online and read about it today, which was a surprise.
I feel like I can ween off my mood stabilizers/anti-depressants, and I'm scheduling an appointment to see if I can.
I was getting ready to hit the gym to so I can pass the physical tests too. Well, Now I have a year to get in better shape (not saying I'm in bad shape, I just don't think I can pass the test)
Its one year, school gets out in 6 months, summer is 2 months, so really all I'm missing out on is 4 months. Sure I won't get to go with my friends, but I'll get to go someday. </TEXT>

I will look at the videos you have provided.
I have at least another year before they will take me, so maybe I'll think about it harder. People have told me to join as an officer and such.

	<TEXT> So, I learned today by a recruiter that any branch of the armed service will not take you if you're on depression medication, and will only take you if you've been off for a year with doctors consent.
So that put a little damper on my parade, I've wanted to join since I was little and I learn I cannot.
Sorry, I just wanted to express and inform people who might want to join some day.

Darn, I was excited too.. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Anyone else getting low jumpy FPS?

My rig is:
i5 2500k @ 3.30 GHz
8GB Ram
GTX 670 2gb

and I have the 331.40 Beta drivers installed.

I don't understand, I can't even run this on Low.


(Sorry if this doesn't belong here)

	<TEXT> Can someone explain why get a fast car but never drive it, not being rude, just curious why pay 60k for a car you never really drive.
Thanks!
