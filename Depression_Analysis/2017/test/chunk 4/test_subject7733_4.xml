	<TITLE> Hypothetical Discussion: What if Roger Waters' solo album "Amused to Death" was released with Pink Floyd instead of The Final Cut? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-11-24 23:42:01 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> DISCLAIMER: The thoughts in this post are just my opinion and should be taken as such, so please just keep that in mind.


So I listened to The Final Cut then Amused To Death right after that, and it got me thinking. What if Waters came to the band with AtD instead of TFC? I personally really like most of TFC, but there are moments I don't care for. I also don't dislike it in the way some PF fans do. I also personally think AtD is Waters' best solo album and really enjoy it, however, I feel like it's missing a small PF feel to it. 


To many fans, I think, they'd consider DSotM through The Wall as the golden era of PF. Would AtD been a continuation of this era? Did Roger have such a chokehold on the band at this point that anything would've split them up? Would it be a great success and considered a classic? Would things have played out differently? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Suggestion for a /r/music community 52 week challenge [meta] </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-09-02 21:22:18 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So /u/LackOfForesight (gotta give him credit) did a thing where he asked /r/music for 52 albums to listen to over a year in an attempt to expand his musical palette. I suggested on his thread, that we listen to the albums as a community and discuss them on a weekly basis. It didn't get really popular but it seemed that there was still a contingent in the community that would like to do this.

* So I was wondering if that's something the community would actually be interested in doing. If this gains enough traction I will definitely be happy to facilitate the postings.

* There's a couple things that need to be cleared up first. Would you guys want use the list of 52 albums that he already compiled, or create a brand new list of "52 must listen to albums"

If you want to suggest a new album please put it in a format like this:

* Artist
* Album
* Genre

You can suggest as many as albums as you'd like, I'll keep track of it all, but keep it reasonable to albums that you think everyone should hear. This doesn't need to be an obscure list either. Suggesting famous albums is perfectly valid too.

I hope to get a decent enough response from you guys, Thanks!

EDIT: Good start, it looks like we'll be making a new list. So this needs to preferably hit the front of music's page to make sure we get enough suggestions. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There has been a lot of variety and changes within the game since the start of the spring split. Champs have come and gone.I was wondering if there was any documentation of all the champs that have been used in this Summer split or Spring Split or both splits combined. And if that list was further broken down by region. It could be like an infographic that shows which region uses the most variety of champions. I'm sure this exists somewhere, so if someone wouldn't mind pointing me in the right direction, I'd appreciate it. Thanks! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This sub-reddit has a thing called their music hall of fame. It's not a list of the greatest bands ever. It focuses more on the bands that have the most links posted of their songs. So to reduce the amount of songs that get posted over and over by the popular bands, reddit made a hall of fame for these bands. Where, basically posting threads of their song links isn't allowed. All bands in the hall of fame have their own sub reddits. You can find this hall of fame on the front page of this sub reddit, on the right side. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Recently got into Pink Floyd over this summer </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-08-27 02:23:31 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I've always been into rock from the 60's-80's era, even though I wasn't alive in those eras. But it wasn't until this past summer where I really started to listening to a bunch of Pink Floyd material and I have been bumping a few of their albums (Wish You Were Here, Dark Side of the Moon, and The Wall) a lot. I first listened to WYWH because I always loved the song even though I never heard the album. So I listened to the album and then from there on I kept listening to more and more. I have also listened to The Final Cut, Meddle, Division Bell, and Animals. I know thats not all of their material, but I was just curious as to what other bands have a similar sound or were heavily influenced by Pink Floyd. I think PF's sound is amazing, I love the amazing guitar-work, the lyricism, the ambiance about the tunes too. 

**TL;DR I recently have been listening to more and more Pink Floyd. Now I'm curious as to what other bands sound like them, or were heavily influenced by them. It can be from any era.**

Thanks! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I like the extended metaphor you used with comparing to reddit, interesting and valid observation. I'm more alarmed, not surprised, but definitely alarmed that the masses like this song by this artist that has 1 song on spotify. Not that spotify is the god of determining musical catalogues, but they usually have a great selection. So I'm just assuming that she is just a pretty face with a voice and will have Disney write her songs. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So yesterday was my 21st birthday, and 2 nights ago (night of Aug. 22 going into the 23rd) I was having a birthday party and had the gnarliest moment ever. I then thought it would be awesome at 11:55 to queue up Wet Sand by Red Hot Chili Peppers so at midnight as I turned 21, John Frusciante's guitar solo was absolutely kicking my ass and it was amazing. Beautiful, gnarly, awesome, it was just the way it had to be done.[Wet Sand, solo around 4:22ish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWNDW5KtiKk)

Much love everyone, have a good day </TEXT>

	<TITLE> The Chelsea community is like no other, and the relationships with players. </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I've been thinking about the recent players who have left our club like Mata, de Bruyne, Lukaku and Luiz, etc. But one thing I've noticed, that when players leave the club, there doesn't seem to be any bitterness to the player from the fans. Hell, Juan was a club favorite and got pushed out by Mou, but he went to Man U of all clubs and Chelsea fans still love him (including me) and Luiz didn't really have a place in Mou's squad, but he was a fan favorite. I think there's a lot that can be said about Chelsea's fanbase as well as the quality of human beings that we bring in. Players with high character and commitment to the club. Arsenal burns players jerseys when they leave, which have been all their best ones, tbh.

**TL;DR Chelsea fans are great and don't hate players after they leave like Arsenal fans do** </TEXT>
