	<TEXT> I was 16, a couple months from turning 17. My mom, sister, her two kids and myself were going to be evicted. I was going to have to move to a new town and start going to a new high school. It was really scary for me. Then a friend's mom and dad offered to let me live with them so I could still go to the same high school. My mom urges me to do what I thought was best for myself so I went and stayed with that friend's family. I lived their for a year and a half and I've never been more grateful for something. </TEXT>

Step 3. Create rituals that are really just bonding experiences for the group.

	<TEXT> Hey everyone, I realize this probably won't get too much support, but I think it's worth a try. I'm now three months behind on rent and I would really love to be able to give my landlord at least a month of rent money ($400). I linked my gofundme page here. The goal on that is $1,200, but any donation will be appreciated greatly. Thank you. http://www.gofundme.com/fdjd8c </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I recently posted trying to get some ideas of ways to make some more money and I would like to thank those who helped! I have some ideas buzzing around to start up a small scale tutoring service at my college and hopefully that helps out a bit. 

Although I have a job I'm not making what I need to make to afford my rent right now. I would love a quick relief for at least a month of rent. My rent is only 400 a month. I fell behind because I had to miss a good amount of work and it sent my life a little out of control. I would love to be able to give my landlord at least 1 month of rent ASAP. My fortunately at this pace I won't be able to pay it all off until sometime in 2015 and who knows if my landlord is going to be forgiving? 

Here is a link to my gofundme, any donation is appreciated no matter how small or generous. Thank you!

	<TEXT> Hey all, I'm in a tough spot when it comes to money and I haven't found much support. I did set up a gofundme, and I got a little money on it from Facebook friends, but that money was really only a little. I'm in college full time, living on my own and I haven't been able to fully pay my rent for three months now and I owe a couple hundred to school. I'm really looking for some ideas to make some money. I tried getting a second job, but the combination of my school schedule and not having a car made that impossible. I recently got over a fight with depression, but I'm worried it's going to come back. Any ideas are welcome, but be serious! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I didn't know who Andre Ellington was at the beginning of the year. I tend to only care about the players from the team I support or whoever is on my fantasy team. I didn't know he was a beast. My team auto drafted him. I said "who is this guy?" So I traded him. Now I see him doing great and it's like watching a fat ex girlfriend look beautiful and not fat with Leo DiCaprio. I see these stats he puts up and I feel like I'm dying a little bit. I'm 3-5 (3 game winning streak though!) and his owner is 8-0. I'm a normal title contender in this league and I know that if I kept him my team would be in a better position. Mr.Ellington I beg for your forgiveness. Forgive me for my naiveness and impatience. I will live the rest of my life indebted to you if you allow me to make the playoffs in this league. Please, Mr. Ellington. Thank you Red Jesus.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have him a my 3rd string QB right now. My team is pretty top heavy so I've got a few expendable bench spots so I figured why not stick him behind Cutler and Big Ben. It prevents him from killing me if he goes to another team and what if he plays out of his mind and out performs Cutler and Big Ben? He's a high risk high ceiling guy and if you have a room for him let him in!   </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I got home from school a few hours ago (I go to community college). I live with two roommates who love to eat my food. I was expecting to make the rest of my spaghetti last until Thursday because I get paid Friday. It was gone when I got home. I get headaches when I'm hungry and they make it really difficult to study and do any work. 
I had to walk home too because I forgot my bus money at home ($1.50 and it's like a 50 minute walk). All I have left is some bread now, but there's a couple pieces left and that won't get me too far.
If someone buys me a nice pizza I'll post it with me smiling and then I will write you an appreciative poem! 
I live in the US and my only option is dominos. Thank you.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I try to fleece people, but so far I've gotten Demaryius Thomas for Sanders/Welker (kid dropped Welker a week later). One of my friends in my league was telling me that he would get these trade offers of Steven Ridley and Torrey Smith for Calvin Johnson (after his week 1 performance). Oh, Doug Martin, Vincent Jackson and MoJo for Peyton is a trade that happened. Sproles, Kelvin Benjamin, T.Y Hilton and Lamar Miller for Frank Gore and Randall Cobb also happened. Those 3 trades that happened involved the same kid. He's traded away Thomas, Manning, Gore and Cobb in 2 weeks. 

edit: added two trades </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I haven't been able to pay my rent for the last few months and for me that is extraordinarily far behind. I'm supposed to be getting money from a car accident case sometime in 2015, but my landlord isn't having it. The money I get from work goes to food and transportation to work/school. I'm 20 years old and I will have no where to turn. My dad lives in Florida (I'm in Connecticut) and we don't talk. My sisters and mom all live together and don't have room for me. I've had to change my life plans recently to try to accommodate me as I am right now, but I might have to change them drastically if I don't get any help soon. I set up a gofundme and a few friends have put some money in. http://www.gofundme.com/fdjd8c is the link to that. I've sold everything I have of value aside from my clothes, phone and laptop. I've tried getting a second job and have been trying for a few months now. If you want more details about how my life is almost ruined you can ask me. Thanks for anything. http://www.gofundme.com/fdjd8c </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I'm going to a local community college and living in my own. My mom is broke and actually asks me for money sometimes. The thing is I'm broke too. I had a nice summer job until I was in a car crash, then a month later I spiraled into a stress fueled depression. I've seen a therapist and I've gotten better, but the stress and anxiety is still taking it's toll. I missed work because of that depression and car crash. I fell behind on bills. I couldn't work at that job anymore. I have a new job now and I'm looking for a second. I owe my landlord 
Nearly 1k and my school 230 before I can apply for the spring semester. I missed school full time last year (would've been my sophomore year) because I was stressing out over life. I'm scared it's happening again and I don't want to get stuck in a life without education. I should get money from the car crash in mid-late 2015, maybe later. Any amount of money will help out. I just desperately want to give my land lord some money and be able to pay back my college. If you need any verification I can provide it. Thank you so much. 

Edit: I just set up a gofundme

I'm in college and I'm used to going until the last dollar is up, but when there's no money what is there to do. I live off campus by myself and I have enough chicken for 2 meals. I would like to save those for Tuesday and Wednesday. Thursday I'm fine - I go out Thursday night after class and one friend pays for us all and I've negotiated switching weeks with him. I was hoping someone could spot me a pizza tonight. Once I get paid I'll go back on here and buy someone pizza. It's only the right thing to do. Thank you! </TEXT>
