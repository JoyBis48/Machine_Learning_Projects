	<TEXT> They're pretty anxious because a couple of months ago the varsity team did a 2k and they watched so they could see how intense it is. Obviously that terrified them, and I'd rather they have a little more preparation than just that. Our coaches have told them some vague splits to shoot for and what rating they should be at, but they aren't ready for the mental aspect of it. Anyone have any favorite articles I can share with them to help them get ready for that third 500?
