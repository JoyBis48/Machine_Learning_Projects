	<TEXT> Have you ever met one of you favorite artists at a festival or in public? I haven't but man do I have a story for you. I went on a trip to Austria last summer (very nice place by the way) once I landed and left my gate I had some time to kill so I decided to look at the people coming through the gate. I notice a guy wearing a destroid hat but I don't think much about it, 5 minuets later I realize that guy was Excision (I kicked my self a bit but I got over it) later I'm browsing Facebook and I see a post that ken from the crystal method is coming to the twin cities to talk about production at a FREE class. Needles to say I was upset </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My man!!! All right this should be easier to explain. Let's say you have your melody, pads and bass routed to channels 1, 2   3 respectively. You'll find a send knob/button at the bottom of each mixer channel, click on it and then click on the send of the channel you want to route too let's say 4 in this case (it should say for example route 1 to 4 in the top left corner if your doing it right) after you've routed all your channels you now have what is called a bus, you can now EQ, distort, compress and side chain everything that is routed to mixer 4 just automate the channel volume slider and bam their you have it :) all of your melodic elements are now side chained! The best part is that if you need to change something you only need to change the one automation. Busses are also great for blending percusive elements like kicks and snares, hope this helps! </TEXT>

I use FL studio because I love the piano roll and interface. As for the mentor someone who can teach me synth programming or give me ideas like "this noise would sound good for the fill" also someone to bounce ideas off of.
