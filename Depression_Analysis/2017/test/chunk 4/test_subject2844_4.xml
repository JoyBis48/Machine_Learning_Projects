	<TEXT> Glad your friend was ok. A friend of mine got hit in the throat in a lacrosse game a few years back. He took a pretty hard shot (80-90 mph) right in the trachea and had to go to the hospital, but he also ended up being okay. Just some trouble breathing for a few days.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not sure who to believe on this post. However, you posted a well thought out, seemingly informative and reasonable post that seems to be from a level of experience. Most posts in Reddit claim to be from someone in that field, when you can sometimes tell the person is just trying to make something up to sound smart or for karma. You are the only post in here on the other side of things, but you don't have that armchair professional air to your rhetoric. I can appreciate that. Have an upvote. </TEXT>

You continue to try to infer things from my posts that couldn't be further from the truth. You are free to try to interpret my anti-terrorism rhetoric however you deem necessary. After all, it is a free country! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You are a complete idiot Cyan. I am of the belief that if you are responsible for a terrorist attack on the United States of America, you should be taken down with swift vengeance. I made no references to the power granted to the NSA or condoned the intrusion of people's basic civil liberties. I would have never guessed in a million years that I would be downvoted for condemning terrorism. Pretty disgusted with this thread right now! </TEXT>
