2)lisa simpson is not truly around all the time sometime she not around sometime she is but always because bart imagined her

	<TEXT> There is no widely accepted theory for either.

When people say shit like that, I doubt they're seriously considering the existing of Universes, let alone assuming that all universes must be 'parallel'. They're simply creating nice thoughts from their current situation, so those thoughts would naturally depend  on re-assuring them, which a parallel universe would serve to do.

	<TEXT> No, opinions are fine on ELI5. You're acting as though they are worthless. Opinions, supported by reasoning, precedent and logic can still potentially be valid and are just fine in lieu of facts. The only issue is if it's presented as a fact, which 004forever didn't do, it's clearly an opinion.

Edit: You're fucking retarded. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not a stupid question, your logic is sound. Your assumptions are not.

My thinking is that if a shitty video doesn't load, I'm more likely to go to another website and do something else, rather than watch more videos.

Google has this data. They can see how much traffic they can get. They can read through piles of feedback. They have the resources to make the change. But they haven't. The odds of it just being pure stupidity on Google's part is quite low.

Most likely, any people refusing to use YouTube because of the occasional video hiccup are probably not anywhere near enough in size to warrant a massive and expensive change in infrastructure. As far as I can tell, YouTube is still growing or at least stabalised in the first place, so I don't even think this problem exists. Lastly, what alternative? There aren't many competitors and what few there are certainly aren't popular.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm thinking so. It basically just seems like it would be TOO strong if it prevented blinking with just the Aghs. This puts higher limits on an OD Aghs wombo combo. It would just be too easy to set up, as opposed to heroes like Magnus or Enigma who at the very least have to jump into the fight first. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Correct, doesn't change the fact that over time that style of sitcom has become boring to me. I still appreciate that it was unique at it's time - like I said, I loved it. But I was simply saying that, over time, it loses what makes it unique because it is now the standard. Hence why it probably doesn't appeal to today's market to quite the extent it did in the 90s.

It's just one of many options today, and many people are sick of the formula before even considering giving older sitcoms a chance. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think there are two reasons people believe this whole thing about 'ridiculous law suits':

1) People misinterpret the word 'sue', as OP has clearly done, or assume that because someone is suing someone they've probably won. A newspaper reports that a burgler is suing a homeowner because he tripped over while stealing their TV. People jump on ship and say how wrong it is, without realising that it hasn't gone to court yet, and he'll probably lose.

2) The flipside: the newspapers don't report enough detail, and people assume the party doing the suing is wrong, when in reality there is a good reason for it. The famous McDonald's hot coffee suit. People see a woman suing McDonald's for her coffee being too hot, and they laugh at her and say the country is going to hell. What they don't do is read into it, where they'll find out that she [severely burned herself (NSFW)](http://blog.3nips.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/stella_liebeck_burned_by_mcdonalds_coffee-524x373.jpg) and required expensive medical treatment and had permanent damage to her vagina. Nor do they read about how that particular McDonald's was serving their coffee too hot on purpose so people would take longer to drink it and increase their chances of ordering more food. Nor do they read about how the McDonald's had been warned several times in the past to quit this practice by health and safety authorities.

These, taken together, greatly reinforce the perception of how common ridiculous lawsuits actually are successful. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'll start by saying I understand that just because countries aren't punished for breaking rules doesn't mean the rules are ineffective - they can be preventative. However I'm specifically interested in cases where Country A broke specific rules of warfare and the United Nations (or historical equivalents) enacted a punishment on said country, rather than just a list of ways the UN is effective because of the laws. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's strange to think that there could be a time where you didn't know what you looked like. This isn't really up to the standard of most answers on askhistorians (I'm usually the one asking the questions!), however I mostly wanted to reply to suggest that the average person could probably see their reflection in water in ponds and what not.

Apart from that, I know we have had mirrors throughout most of human history, made of bronze and copper, so some people definitely would have access to a clear reflection of themselves. However I'm unsure if the typical medieval commoner would have had access to them. Which leads to a follow up question of my own: assuming easy access to reflections were not available, would it have been common for towns to have publically available mirrors or reflecting ponds specifically for this purpose? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Actually I hate their inclusion in the films. Every enemy Widow or Hawkeye, or even Cap take out is just another enemy that Thor or Hulk would take out with an effortless AoE attack. 

It also makes it harder to have the villain go full force. Any villain that can go hand to hand with Thor should be able to snap Widow in half in a heartbeat. But they don't. So we have to see these characters getting hurt enough to make the villain seem strong but not so badly that they're seriously hurt. It makes the villains seem inconsistent.

Their inclusion just hurts the movies imo. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Being evil isn't the defining quality of being a monster.

Being a monster or a monstrosity by definition refers to extremes though. I'd say a pure evil person is more of a monster than a human being that struggles with moral dilemmas in ever episode. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> But the term 'monster' itself refers to an extreme to begin with, so I'd say someone who is purely evil to the absolute extreme as is so from birth is still more of a monster than someone who slowly becomes bad/evil (but not quite as evil) over the course of time. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's saying that someone is more evil if they're less evil and gradually become a little evil then someone who is pure evil. It makes no sense because you're either more evil than someone or you aren't, it doesn't matter if you were good to begin with.

Someone who quickly become evil from a young age, perhaps because of upbringing or a traumatic event, is still more evil than a good person who slowly starts to do morally questionable things. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Title is a bit of a mouthful, so I'll provide an example: I have a gun that holds 20 bullets. I have 200 ammo in reserve. I fire ten bullets. I reload, throwing the old clip/magazine/whatever away. I now have 190 ammo in reserve and 20 in my gun.

Wouldn't it be more realistic and more interesting mechanically to only have 180 left (since I discarded 10 bullets that remained in my gun earlier)? Whenever I play a horror survival or a more realistic styled game I always wish it worked that way. Even for more fast paced multiplayer FPS games I think it would make monitoring ammo and deciding when to reload more interesting.

So... why ISN'T it that way? Seems like it would be the natural default? What started this trend, or has it always been this way? </TEXT>

He showcased his (still incredibly impressive) speed, accuracy, strength and technique in highly controlled environments. A lot of claims about Bruce are more legend than fact.

There are plenty of martial artists that would hand his ass to him on a plate in a real fight. I'm not trying to undermine his accomplishments, he wasn't trying to be a fighter in the first place, so it doesn't matter. I just feel a lot people put him on a pedestal and assume the man must be an unparalleled fighter.

I've heard people say he could beat Mike Tyson (in his prime) in a fight. </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2015-04-28 10:47:16 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> For example, work sent me on a training exercise where we learnt things like "You only use 10% of your brain" and some people are "left brained while others are right brained" and basically played a bunch of pre-school tier games that would somehow making us better workers... or something, while my actual work piles up at my desk. 

One quick Google search completely tears the very basis of these training sessions apart. I wish I could remember some of the other pseudo-psychology I've heard, I just remembered those two examples because they're common in the real world too.

I've been to about four like this in just two years, and dozens of employees came alongside me to each. The amount of money lost on labour, travel expenses and to hire these people would be phenomenal.

So why do companies, who are probably finding ways to cut costs everywhere, have such poor quality control for these sorts of events.

My perception about how common this is may just be distorted, but these training sessions have occurred in multiple workplaces for me and my friends have shared similar sentiments. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm just going to copy and paste my response from that thread:

For me, whether modding or not is good for gaming depends entirely on whose perspective you're referring too.
Obviously, this change is only a benefit to modders. They can still put their products up for free, if they want, or they can look to make a profit (no matter how small it is, it's more than nothing, I don't think "only 25%" is a valid argument).

However, most people complaining about this are complaining about it from the point of view of consumers, not modders. For us, it is bad.

The most probably positive is it will lead to higher quality mods. But honestly, I don't see that happening. People already put a great deal of care and attention into their mods. The marginal increase in quality that paid mods might create is in no way worth the several dollars I will now be charged. And even if the increase in quality is substantial, I think most consumers would prefer hundreds of great mods for free instead of just picking 2-3 paid mods that are of slightly higher quality than usual.

On the opposite side, we're already seeing downside to paid mods ignoring price (issues over ownership, one mod already has in game pop-ups in its free version, issues concerning mods breaking or not interacting together, making them worthless after you buy them, and so on).

I think it's a real stretch to call this immoral, or to say Valve/modders can't or shouldn't want to be paid for their services. However, that's not the question. The question is if there is anything WRONG with it. And I'd say yanking away hours of enjoyment and a strong community built around modding for joy, not money, is seen as wrong by a lot of people.

On a final note, it's one less thing about Steam I liked taken away. The workshop wasn't perfect, but it was convenient (if a mod is on both workshop and Nexus, workshop is a slightly easier install. Now I won't use it at all). So, for me at least, it's making want to purchase games on Steam even less. Anyway, that's my two cents. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The modders can make their own site and sell it. But they'd probably make less money than selling it through Steam with a 100% cut on their own website.

They're not paying for the hosting costs or effort on Valve's part. The paying for being in a highly visible (and therefore highly valuable) location. Anyway, I think the 25% cut is the LEAST important part of this debate. It's a number and it can change.

The more important issue is how this will affect the quality or mods and the value of games that are highly dependent on mods. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So... Ultron could have easily won if he just didn't make his presence know to the Avengers, right?

The only times he had to make his presence known for his plans to work was when he first encountering Jarvis. But he could have killed Jarvis, escaped though the Internet and laid low. Stark wouldn't have been able to work out the AI came alive, just that it caused a huge issue with his network.

He could have built his robot army/meteor machine in private, unknown to the rest of the world. Once the thing went into motion, it is unlikely the Avengers could work out what was happening in time.

But what about the twins? Or becoming known to the scientists who he tricked into building him his new body?

He wouldn't need either of these things if the Avengers weren't after him in the first place.

TL;DR: Ultron dun goofed. </TEXT>

I think most people would rather date a 7/10 personality than a 7/10 looks than a 10/10 personality and 5/10 looks. For a lot of people for already have nice personalities, their bodies are probably the area they need to work on most. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I can't say I'm surprised by a billionaire wanting even more money, but I kind of see where OP is coming from. To my knowledge, Valve wasn't started to be like your typical company. It was a guy who loved videogames wanting to make videogames.

If I were a billionaire, every extra dollar would seem marginally less appealing. Eventually, I'd care more about pleasing my fans (and stroking my massive ego to my own circle jerk) than making any more money. OK, maybe that tune would change if I actually were a billionaire, but at the moment I guess the idea of having that much money is so alien to me I just can't imagine why you'd NEED any more - especially at the expense of your own fans and your own 'child' (Valve). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Watch from 0:42 seconds onwards in OPs video. You see the guy jump on his car (coinciding with about 1:16 in the video you linked).

You can see he is completely blocked by traffic 'stage left'. [Here's a screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/Jv37wtR.png) (the traffic is clearer if you watch the video though).

In fact, I would not be surprised if this exact angle is exactly what the Defense Attorney was discussing in this quote here:
"When we saw the first video **[I believe he is referring to the one you linked]**, it could have been interpreted in a different way, but after looking at other videos **[this is referring to OPs video, which was considered vital to getting a proper interpretation of events]** and putting it all together, I think we must be careful not to take a decision too quickly," Vaillancourt said." </TEXT>
