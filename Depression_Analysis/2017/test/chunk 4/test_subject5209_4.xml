	<TEXT> I work in the same environment and have had the same exact issue.

Sales manager at our sister plant in a different city calls IT. Says she has a new hire sitting in a cubicle, ready to work. No form was submitted to our department, letting us know anything about the new hire.

She asks what we can do for the new employee that day. I told her that we can give him some magazines to read until his thin client is set up, which normally doesn't take too long since we happen to have some in stock. Unfortunately, since she waited to tell us about the new guy...the new guy is going to wait until  *we*  get ready for him to work.

It may seem like we in the IT department are assholes, but everyone else is a bunch of bastards! </TEXT>
