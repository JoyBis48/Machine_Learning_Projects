	<TEXT> I sure hope they remove that stupid delay between the US showing episodes months before the UK receives them, you'd think nowadays that most countries would get things around the same time

Also, when will season 2 air in the UK ??? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I know this was sung briefly in the cell by the old woman in an episode in the first series but I wonder if the full "I used to give her roses" will feature on an episode soon

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TC38KlmnSo

Maybe in the final season finale it has to be played over the last scenes, they need to do a homage when the final season ends and the prisoners all go on to pastures new

It would need to be Lynne Hamilton credited in the last episode as that song is probably more remembered than any of the Cell Block H characters </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Would be great to have a few cameos from those who were in Cell Block H

They should have Ray Meagher (Alf Stewart / Home   Away) back as he was in the original as Geoff Butler / Ernest Craven / Kurt Renner </TEXT>
