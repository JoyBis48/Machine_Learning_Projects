	<TEXT> My girlfriend has this same problem and wonders why she can't make friends. I've never been able to establish a concrete reason why people don't like her, she is a very nice and attractive person. I also have the same problem with making friends. So...our solution is just fucking our brains out and giving the middle finger to the world. Fuck it all and have sex. Forced friends will invariably let you down in some way, and in a way you almost set yourself up for failure, I think, by scrutinizing things too closely. Another suggestion from me would be to put yourself in a place you would not normally be, get out of your comfort zone. Good luck!   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Personally I feel they are a pro-lgbt and pro-human rights group in "disguise." They announce ahead of time where they are going to protest. Almost every time they are mentioned in the news it is also mentioned that the community came together to form a human wall or something to stop them. And they just stand out there smiling holding their signs, then pack up and leave without hurting anybody. I feel their message is in fact not "God Hates Fags" or anything along that line. I think their message is more about the community coming together in harmony and they have found a way to do it consistently. Just a thought.  </TEXT>
