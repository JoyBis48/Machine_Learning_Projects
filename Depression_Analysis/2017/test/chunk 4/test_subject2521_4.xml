The same thing can be said about grocery stores. If it's busy and a sacker isn't available; sack your own groceries while items are being rang up. It will cut down on the time spent by the checker and holding up the line.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Recipe: http://www.surrealconfections.com/2013/03/irish-crepe-cake.html?m=1

Tips:

- Each crepe takes between 15-20min to prepare. ~10 minutes for the first side and, give or take a few, about 5-10 once you flipped to the other side.

- If you have more than one saute pan, you'll be a lot happier. I wish I had at least 4. Otherwise I spent between 3-4 hours just to make the crepes.

- Try not to eat all the whipped cream before spreading it onto the crepes!!! :-)

Sorry for the bad pictures. I was really excited to make this for St. Patty's  and wanted to share; even though it looks sloppy. 

Edit: More info </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I never understood the obsession other women have over diamonds and always felt it was a marketing scheme. Turns out my intuitions were right.

In today's world, a lot of marketing can be seen as a scheme. Hell with all the photoshop enhanced pictures, even what is perceived as 'true beauty' is a scheme. Unfortunately a lot of people fall for the hype. 

I didn't post this for intentions of 'clickbait'. I share stories I find interesting, and with other people. That's what this sub-reddit is all about, whether or not you agree, or approve, of the post.

I do not know a lot about him, but I've been told he has a job and a home. There are a lot of homeless (and mentally unstable) people in town, but he has a lot going for him, dispite his circumstances. </TEXT>

I've spent the past year doing this and just this week, I finally found the answer I was looking for. It wasn't easy coming  to terms with it, but I now know why I behave the way I do, today. 

I wish you the best of luck! :-) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A good memory isn't necessarily genetic. It, like all forms of learning, requires repetition. 

Math is a necessity in life. Especially if you want to excel in todays world. 


Binary Coding = Math

Physics = Math

Computer Science = Math

And the basics:
Econ, Accounting, etc.


I grew up hating math because teachers used a method I never understood. Let me rephrase that. It was something I wanted to understand and would tell them that they needed to actually show me how to do it, not just tell me. It clearly wasn't something they could handle. A week after my first college math course, I finally understood what I hadn't years earlier b/c someone took the time to explain it to me in a language I finally understood. Since then I have loved math.


Also:
Instead of just teaching math, teachers should provide real-world examples of it being used. If you want a student to appreciate what they're doing, actually show how it will benefit them later on.

The only problem with this is the fact you have no come to the realization as to why you are unhappy. 

My childhood was a complete sh*t-hole, so finding that inner-peace as an adult hasn't come easily. I am lucky enough to have found someone whom I love and want to spend the rest of my life with. The only problem is the fact that I'm still broken, inside.
