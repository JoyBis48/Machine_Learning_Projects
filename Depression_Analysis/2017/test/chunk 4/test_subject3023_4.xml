	<TEXT> Not sure what he's looking for in a point. Unless you've got a quest book, Minecraft is a game where you do whatever you want. It's sandbox for a reason. If he truly wanted a point, he could use HQM or play another game.

And it's not like TiC has more of a point than EIO.

What could have happened:
 someone (~chatzilla@2001:558:6025:b:61a6:66e3:ae28:196a) has joined #TinkersConstruct

"I've made a Pickaxe. What am I supposed to make next?"

"Tell me there's something to make next. I will be severely disappointed if there isn't."

"I'm looking for progression or something to do other than 'hurr move dirt and stone around'"

"I'm looking for a goal or task that the mod wants me to perform."

"The mod has content with absolutely no direction or purpose on its own?"

It's a sandbox game. It's not meant to have a goal. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For the armour, it only blocks 90% of damage now, if you have the required blood. However, using Soul Harden, you can get it back to 100%.
But it was buffed at the same time. Now it has more protection against Piercing and other negative effects like Wither. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's filling the internal buffer. If anyone were to use "I'm Looking at Blood" (an addon for WAILA), or take out the Vanilla Sigil of Sight, they'd see that it is filling the internal buffer. 

The Internal Buffer itself holds 10% of the Altar's max capacity, so for a non-upgraded Blood Altar, it would drain about 1000 blood. Subsequent upgrades (E.X. Runes of Augmented Capacity) will increase that, and Runes of Dislocation will increase the speed at which it fills/empties. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I know how to use Lockdown, m8. But until the feature is added that allows for one to specify the spawn dimension, you can use PerfectSpawn to specify it.

As of right now, Lockdown and PerfectSpawn do different things, as Lockdown generates the same world, and PerfectSpawn specifies an exact spot for people to spawn at. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Adding to this.

For even more guidance on mods that aren't in Monster, [Material Energy^3](http://forum.feed-the-beast.com/threads/1-6-4-material-energy-3-jampacked-hqm-ctm-beta.48913/) appears to be popular, as well as [Running Red](http://forum.feed-the-beast.com/threads/1-6-4-running-red-v1-1-4-jam-packed-hardcore-magic-rpg-good-as-crash-landing.47464/) (#Shamelessplug).

Running Red is focused around telling a story (and a fun mod called [Blood Magic](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/1290532-1-7-10-2-1-6-4-blood-magic-v1-2-0-updated-oct-13)), and may have a theme a little too dark for some people. It tied with Crash Landing in second for the Jam-Packed competition, which makes it just as popular. Right? .

ME^3 is focused around conquering dungeons in an amazing CTM style experience, having you collect trophies, complete quests, and complete the Periodic Table. It's a very fun and popular experience. It won first place in Jam-Packed, and I really recommend checking it out. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm testing a new release right now. It's *mostly* bugfixes, as it's been hard to add new content while working on three packs. Recently I've been requested to update PhoenixCraft II, and as well, I need to get that one update out for Running Red.

Once I finish all those, I'll start on adding new content. I have some things in mind.... ;) </TEXT>
