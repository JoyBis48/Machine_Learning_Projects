So we may not get a sequel till after FF2 and even then Trank has his star wars movie to do. So if Chronicle 2 does happen it wont be directed by Trank.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So the last episode was called the return and we got a surprise guest apperance from Manu Bennett as slade. The episode implied that Bennet was returning as Slade but he didn't really did he? he ended up back in Prison and imo It was more of a guest apperance than a return. A return to me would of been him escaping so he could of been used later on. I just found the episode title a bit misleading.

	<TEXT> Is anyone else worried that Sony is selling off its TV and smartphone divisions and wants to invest more in PlayStation? I mean what if their investment fails to return a profit in 3-4 years time? would Sony consider selling the PlayStation brand as well? The last thing the gaming industry needs is a monopoly controlled by Microsoft. Nintendo really doesn't have any stake in the industry anymore like MS and Sony currently do. Would you guys still support PlayStation if it was purchased by another brand like Samsung? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So get this, In the newest trailer there is a shot of Jason stathams Ian Shaw blowing up a car, next shot you see Dominic looking all sad at a photograph of his family .I think Shaw kills Brian and Universal is hiding it pretty damn well. What do you think? Here's the sequence im talking about. http://imgur.com/a/s10Zi now this could be just the way the trailers cut but it seems kinda obvious now that Shaw will kill someone close to Dom whether its Brian I cant say for sure but why else have that shot with the family photo with Brian in the center? </TEXT>

PC recommended specs will be able to run the game on 30 or 60 frames per second? 

I think, we'll stick with 30 FPS. We're not going to stop working on performance until the very end, it's crucial matter to us, there are different PCs with different specs. Programmers insisted on avoiding tricking the players by lowering predicted specs. As I mentioned before, It can only get better. </TEXT>
