Is this suppose to be a bad thing? Or do we really want things happening without a proper set-up and build-up a la Captain Earth.

I think the exposition was delivered well either through the flow of character interactions or background dialogue (radio). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Prior to the Royals there were the 2006 Diamondbacks with Justin Upton, Stephen Drew, Conor Jackson, Carlos Quentin, Carlos Gonzalez and Chris Young. Quentin and Gonzalez were used to get Haren. Their pitching prospects aren't worth mentioning hence the Haren trade.

2007 and 2011 were the only good years they had. D-backs and Royals show how fickle talent development could be. Even the Rays took years to figure it out. </TEXT>

I think that's quite the opposite. He usually follow his emotions impulsively (with both negative and positive results). Right now he's feeling scared, so his instinctive response is to avoid the situation. If he actually thought things through he would've arrived to a logical conclusion that it's best for Kaori's recovery for them to stay "special" friends.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So Sidonia did not encounter a Gauna for a hundred years. Then Nagate surfaces and almost right away a Gauna shows up.

The Captain predicted that the Council would want Nagate dead so she purposely navigated Sidonia into Gauna territory so she can sortie him and somewhat appease the Council. Although not ideal, this situation fits her strategy of defeating the Gauna instead of running away, with Nagate as her ace just like the way she pictured Hiroki should have been. This is also why she doesn't give a shit about the Kabi's attracting Gaunas.

Also I'm speculating Ochiai threw away the Kabis in order to force the Council to use his Gauna-Human hybrid as a weapon since it can kill Gaunas without a Kabi. </TEXT>

Hase gets clean up duty. His crepe date then goes to hell. He loses special friends status. Fujimiya seems to have stopped writing in her diary. The street light then forebodingly flickers off on Hase. All of these happened in a span of one day.

Being Hase truly is suffering. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The way Shaft used the song was underwhelming.

The story about Ayano and the orphans, the story of the Monster, the Snake's schemes and how Kano fits in all of this were awkwardly put together. There was no flow whatsoever.

I was hoping for a jigsaw puzzle story that would cleverly put the pieces together but with only three episodes left I would not get my hopes up that the show can pull that off.

	<TEXT> AoT animation was even more inconsistent than KoS. The first half of that show was littered with stills and some of them out of context to the dialogue. There were even [unfinished](http://media.animevice.com/uploads/1/13547/659701-2hmdkci.jpg) portions and the studio [apologized](http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2013-05-09/attack-on-titan-staff-apologizes-for-unfinished-episodes-on-3-stations) for some of them.

Also, in general, anime shows are animated in low framerates. We're talking about 8-12 fps or sometimes lower. KoS isn't really any worse than any anime in terms of FPS, it just looks more jarring when applied to CG. Just imagine any Pixar movie rendered at 8 fps and it would look more noticeable than most animes.

KoS's frame rate has gotten better though and action always looked fluid. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Only ones I know that were clear about couples having sex:

**NANA.** Also much of the romance centers around adults who are already in a relationship. It's great and much different than most romance animes, I highly recommend it.

**Otona Joshi no Anime Time.** Four different stories about four different women. It deals with adults so the themes are mature; single working woman, unhappy marriages, and dysfunctional family. 

**ef: a tale of memories.** Teen romance with the common anime trait of characters unable to commit. The characters are well written though.

There's also White Album 2 and Clannad. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hinata's energy gets me hyped up. I really like how most of the characters play off of that energy or just with each other in general.

This episode did sports speeches really well. Those speeches a lot of the time feel obligatory and contrived just like they did in Episode 4. In this episode they felt really natural and flowed with the story and dialogue. 

Also the OST if amazing.

Also we finally get a connection between the "Monster" and the rest of the cast. The teacher, who's also Ayano's father seems to be involved also. Maybe they're the family?

Eternity seems to be a theme here. The monster is immortal, Ene woke up in a body that's practically immortal, Haruka seems to have been granted an immortal body and Ayano seems to exists in a time and space where she's eternal. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In the flashback in Episode 2 when as a kid Smile said he wanted to be like Peco, I don't think he meant in terms of skill and talent. I don't think he saw him as a hero in that way either. I think for him, to be like Peco is to love and enjoy Ping Pong. Smile probably did enjoy Ping Pong but as he watched Peco's passion for the sport fade way so did his enjoyment along with it.

What I think Smile is playing for and chasing after is that enjoyment for the sport that he used to share with Peco. </TEXT>

There's a difference between institutionalized discrimination and personal bigotry. They seemed to be fighting against the latter when the former is far more important. The former could be changed with progressive policies while the latter can't.

Obviously bigotry is not OK but like Mayumi said you can't change what an individual feels by force.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I guess those Gardes are worth more than civilian lives and structural damage. As cold as it sounds it kind of makes sense since they're the only line of defense and must be used as a last resort. Even just losing 1/8 of their Gardes would be a huge blow and that's with very little guarantee that the Guana won't get through. So if the option to evade is there then it's probably the best option most of the time.

Still pretty ballsy and quick risk assessment by the Captain.

I didn't expect to experience such an intense space battle so soon after Yamato 2199. What a great surprise.

Also gotta love the detail and design on those graphic displays, UI, and flight instruments. It's the little things that create the space sci-fi atmosphere. </TEXT>

And the dialogue was good enough that it came off as a natural reaction from a young man who's in love. Although, I still would've preferred if the show used something less cliche and convenient.

I also really liked how vague they are about the diary during the riverside conversation. It expresses how unsure they are on how to handle the situation but both know how important it is to them. I think that really made the resolution all the more gratifying. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> CG also allows the animators to have more freedom with the camera work since the camera is operating in 3d. In 2d they redraw all the different angles which is a lot more work. The amount of camera angles, transitions, and different POVs that we saw in this show's action scenes are something you're rarely going to see in 2d animation.

Also I really like the lighting and shadowing in this show, again something hard to pull off in traditional animation.

Hopefully CG in anime keeps improving, variety is a good thing. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I actually want to see Kunato try to pilot the Type 17 and possibly make a fool of himself. According to that little bit of exposition the Type 17 demands more from the pilot since the computer system isn't as advanced. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The framerate is up and down. 1st episode I thought it was ok, 2nd episode it was really distracting and 3rd episode it's ok-ish. Overall I think the show looks great.

I didn't expect all of them to die. Even though someone dying was predictable I thought it was executed well. The voices of panic and everyone's composure unraveling were pretty convincing. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> He doesn't have to commit and it might remain that way but I'm just pointing it out that it's a weakness.

Throwing a game is disrespectful to the opponent since it belittles their effort and pride. I highly doubt Kong would appreciate being pitied like that. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Tsukimoto's strong sympathy for his opponents is a big weakness but equally so is his view of ping pong as something inconsequential to him. Even if he can become a stonecold player there's really not much that drives him to win, after all this is just a hobby to him. Once he meets his match talentwise he wouldn't have as much resolve as someone who loves the sport, committed to excellence and have a strong will to win.

Weirdly enough Tsukimoto reminds me of Nodame (a pianist) from Nodame Cantabile. Both are talented at their craft but for differing reasons they have trouble committing to it and seeing it as more than a hobby. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I really wish this didn't go the amnesia route. We already have a series with the same "mysterious powerful girl" setup that uses amnesia as a plot device.

The interaction between the three is starting to grow on me and inserting some world building gives the show a sense of adventure. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Why the fuck is there a case of mass destruction inside a Gastrea?

Also, some of these scenes are put together well with decent enough dialogue but the overacted voice acting spoil these scenes. The screaming and wailing can be a bit grating which is a shame since I like how the show is building up the bond between Rentaro and Enju. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, a bit heavy handed with the character emotions and motives. It's going with the old "angsty MC with a tragic past" concept; nothing wrong with that but the portrayal was way too straightforward and unrefined. Despite all of that, I didn't mind the first episode, it was effective in establishing the dark tone albeit a bit forceful, and it did enough to piqued my interest.

Hopefully the drama doesn't get too overbearing and the show would let it breath. I haven't seen much of Okada's work but she's been criticized for overdone melodrama, so I'm crossing my fingers here. I really really liked Anohana though, melodrama aside. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I know anime fans love to complain about MCs in romance shows being wish-washy and beating around the bush but this one is quite the opposite. The relationship feels rushed and unearned, and lacks chemistry. The show hasn't done enough with the dialogue and circumstances to build a feeling of genuine bond between the two. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Gotta commend Tatsuya for his composure when Miyuki was working her "charms." If I were in his place...ummm I might start questioning my moral values lol.

This has all the makings of a fun guilty pleasure show; overpowered MC, imouto fetishism, nonsense jargon, awkward take on discrimination, and good action. </TEXT>
