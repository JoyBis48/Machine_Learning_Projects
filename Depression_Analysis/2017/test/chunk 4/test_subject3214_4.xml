	<TEXT> Well if we looked at the date he wrote the letter to Walker, October 28th, 2014, it looks like literally one week before the real life November 4th, 2014 midterms. The problem is that we don't know the exact date that Walker resigned and when Frank took his oath and assumed office. But since there wasn't any mention of midterm results in Chapter 26, I'm sure the first episode of Season 3 will give us the results. 

Regardless, in 2016 we're going to have a situation where President Underwood would have been in office for over two years. Underwood's first "term" started late October/early November 2014. If he gets re-elected in 2016, his second term would start when he's inaugurated in January 2017. So his first term is over two years and if we use a plain meaning rule reading of the 22nd Amendment, it's seems clear that he wouldn't be able to run again in 2020.

But you can be sure he would try to get around that somehow when 2020 comes around (assuming the show is still on the air then). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is wonderful. It's been a long time since I've seen a picture that really "stared into my soul" so to speak. I didn't break eye contact for a solid minute just looking at her. Brilliantly done. </TEXT>
