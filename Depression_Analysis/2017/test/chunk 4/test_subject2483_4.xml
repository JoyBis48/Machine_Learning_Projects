	<TEXT> It was not failed. After Trajan's death, emperor Hadrian was more concerned in preserving the empire, not expanding it. He decided that Mesopotamia could not be kept, and so voluntarily retreated. Whether the Roman Empire could have held on to that land is mere speculation. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The most direct benchmarks are the individual indices. The German Dax 30, French CAC 40, British FTSE 100, Italian FTSE MIB 40, the Spanish IBEX 35. These five economies consist of over half of the EU GDP so can be a good gauge, four of them (excluding the FTSE 100) are in the euro zone. However, due to the German and french economic clout in the euro area, the DAX and CAC 40 could suffice.

There is the Stoxx 50: the fifty largest Eurozone companies; which is maybe something you are looking for. However, it is similar to the Dow Jones Inudstrial Average 30, as there are very few companies.

The S P Europe 350, or the FTSE Europe 300 could also be indices that you are interested. But to be honest, these are not that good. For example, they include Swiss companies, which are neither in the EU nor euro zone.

Overall, of course, its up to you. Make your own judgement. I believe it is best to use the individual indices as the Europe is by no means united enough (hopefully soon) to have a single index. Compare the European economies and you will understand what I mean. But if you insist, try using the Stoxx 50.

Hope this helped, good luck! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I wish the new unit would be an upgrade built in tech lab needing armory. This upgrade would revamp the reaper, so that it becomes useful again in the late game. This would reduce the need of new hotkey, be a barracks unit, and make the reaper useful later in the game.
What the upgrade should do to it, how much it will cost, etc. is not up to a plat player to decide. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Instead of a new unit, why cant we have an upgrade to the reaper. This upgrade would require some later game building (armory?) and would completely transform the reaper into some better unit. This would keep the same amount of hotkeys, and make reapers useful later on in the game. Im no pro, so I dont want to propose how the reaper should change, but Im sure this would be better than simply adding a new unit. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Open letter to multiplayer game host. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-03-18 10:06:47 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Dear multiplayer game host,

Why do you ban people?

You were playing as Maya on pangea, and were winning by a wide margin. I was Austria, slowly being surrounded by your cities. I convince everyone to unite against you as you declare war on me, and I fight tooth and nail. I forward expand towards you to defend myself, and I obviously troll you to rustle your jimmies. 
Why did you ban me and everyone else from the game dear host?
What is the point? Why do you even play on multiplayer then? You were far from losing, why dont you accept the challenge? Why do you, dear host, always ban the person who challenges you? Why do you do that? And why do you call me 'noob' right before banning me? If im so bad, why ban me?

So many questions, but the only answer I see is "You have been kicked". Please love me back...

Sincerely,
Everyone else in the game.

PS. In all seriousness, why do hosts even play multiplayer if all they do is ban the first threat they see? Why isnt there some voting where a majority needs to vote for banning a player? 

PSS. Oh and host, please buy BNW, G K is sh*t (no trade roads!?). </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Question about valuations of solar companies. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-03-02 20:57:05 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hey r/investing!
So I am interested in the solar energy market for many reasons which you can easily find throughout the internet. I am interested in picking individual stocks (no hate please), but I have no knowledge of any solar company (apart from vague knowledge due to Elon Musk investing in SolarCity).
Therefore, I looked at two solar ETF's, found 6 of their largest holdings each, and wanted to find the biggest companies. This is because, in a emerging industry, I would like only the largest companies. 
Here they are, ranked by their weighting in the ETF's: 
https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1XfbhRl9XYBIgPxbqtpNMo802W5MQ76BPgSZVtj13D-E/edit?usp=sharing

I know many of you here are interested in solar, so I am sure this would help you guys. My question is, why is Hanergy so over valued? Is solar city so overvalued because of Mr. Musk? I would love some brief explanations of why some companies are so overvalued compared to others. 

Thanks so much! And I hope this little chart is helpful! </TEXT>
