	<TEXT> They DID mention a new one coming down the line soon enough. It may not make you feel awesome but who cares? For me I'm repping my favorite smite team and youngbae is my favorite Apollo player he got me to play Apollo again after I stopped. So I'm damn well buying the skin and you don't have to I just thing that it's just a nice little change up. You don't HAVE to like it. You also don't HAVE to get the skin. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Maybe it doesn't fit your appeal. As a legendary Apollo I think it looks nice and may wait for gem drop BUT with the free gems you can win this weekend you may only have to pay for 400. I think it looks nice. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> League of Legends has it, Dota 2 has it, what about Smite? I know some may think that it could be a disadvantage; but I disagree. I mean, if you and another friend of yours want to join a ranked game and duo or just play together so you don't feel totally alone. Also, everybody else can do it as well. So pretty much everyone can get an advantage if they chose to play with someone. For me, it is more of just a comfort thing of knowing your friend is in the same game with you. Plus, you may work well with your friend if you two were to duo. It just discourages me because about 5 of my close friends all play smite and we constantly do premades, sieges, arenas, and assaults. Occasionally if someone isn't on we will play conquest. What do you guys think?  </TEXT>
