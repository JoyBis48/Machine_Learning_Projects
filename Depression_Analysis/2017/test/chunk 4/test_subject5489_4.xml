I'm absolutely sure I'm missing some other films.

Also, don't get me wrong. I was pumped about this film for months. I love Kevin Smith, and I'm glad it got him funding for 'Clerks III', so word. I found the film hilarious and sickening at the same time. So many kudos.

My beef? It's not original. It may be funny, it may be unsettling, but it isn't original. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> My one year free of weed </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-09-21 03:21:30 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> It's been a crazy ride for sure. I just want to share some of my story and experiences. Maybe some one else went through some of the same things as I did. Maybe you're going through it now.

I started smoking weed at 16, I was a musician so it felt natural. I preferred cigarettes and alcohol, so I never got too sucked in. I crushed on most of the guys I smoked with, they made me feel a false sense of validation. I stopped briefly, and by the time I got to college, I fell in love with mary jane again. Or at least the people passing me the blunt.

One day a friend told me, "Hey man, you know you need to buy a sack at some point, right?" It hit me like a light from heaven; holy shit, I can buy weed. So I did. Again, and again, and again. I couldn't afford college after another year, being out of state, and too depressed to work, so I left. Shit got worse.

I smoked all day, every day. Medical grade, all the time. I went in and out of programs and rehabs, mostly because I liked the alcohol, weed, pill combos. Years went by. I was moving at a snail's pace.

I ended up moving on a whim to another state, and ended up in a shitty relationship in a shitty apartment. Fuck, the weed there wasn't even that great. But I put my game face on, and bought frequently from H dealers. Never any hard stuff. Just weed.

I had an epiphany after I had some money stolen. I invited a bunch of friends over (fitting). We smoked. We drank. We popped pills. And I cried. I cried because I lost not only my money, but because I lost myself. I called 911 on myself, went to a hospital, and left after 3 days.

23, in the middle of a new state, and trying to stay sober, was insane. I couldn't sleep most nights. I stopped drinking caffeine. I was desperate for friends. My boyfriend and I fought constantly. But I kept my goal in mind, just fucking stay sober.

I had the insight to leave the state, and plan my next move. I found a town I liked, with a career program I liked, and moved on in. Still fresh in my absence from weed, I was still overly talkative and couldn't find enough ways to spend my time. Unemployed. Lonely. A mess.

I made friends were I could, kept looking for a job, and prayed. I prayed all the time. Sometimes with other people, mostly by myself. Some people find it weird for an LGBT man to be spiritual, but fuck, that's all I had going. My family slowly starting respecting me again. I got phone calls from people that cared. I was moving forward, and people took notice.

Finally, after all the job searching, I got a job I loved. Soon, a new car. Soon after that, I broke up with my long distance boyfriend, and I was dating normal people again. Things still affect me, but I have the emotional willpower to handle them like an adult. Life isn't so much a roller coaster, more so a stroll over the sand dunes at a beach. Every moment more beautiful than the last, even if I can't see the ocean from my point of view.

I can't really dish out advice. I don't feel like that's my place. I can just share what I've gone through, and it was hell. I wouldn't wish that upon my worst enemy, even if that happens to be me.

Life today is beautiful. And i'm glad to be hear to share it with you. </TEXT>

I'm just puzzled by the last line. For such an arboreal piece, why the open sky? Do trees not obscure the world above them? Or is it that he loved the trees so much that he scaled them to the top? I'm not sure. It definitely left me thinking.

	<TEXT> Fog rolling over roads so you can't see straight,

Bats clouding out the cave exit a few feet ahead,

Sand storm hitting at 62 miles per hour face first,

A river torrent opposing your swim as you move up stream;

Intangible, it's all just impossible to put my finger on.

I don't even know if our love was ever real.

Maybe it was just all in my head, my weak and fragile head.

Regardless of what I experienced, I walk forward, blinded.

I don't walk back and ask for help, I simply walk forward. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Any one else feel like this?

I slack off on going to meetings and keeping up with my marijuana sobriety, and the guilt just builds and builds until its all consuming and I treat people around my like 'things' and not people.

I had a friend tell me he wanted to relapse this morning because of an exboyfriend he was trying to get in contact with was ignoring him. That could easily have been me. I obsess over people. I try rehashing old relationships and getting butt hurt about it. I just broke up with my ex and now that guilt is building on my guilt of not going to enough meetings.

So I let go. I just go to a meeting. I let go. I go on a date with someone else. I let go. I pray and write poetry. I let go. I write to you guys seeking our shared experiences in marijuana sobriety about what guilt means to you and how you deal with it. 

Thanks. </TEXT>

the hair wants to matt, it has all these oils and double-coated-ness that's just begging to matt, a trait special to these hungarian dogs with central asian ancestry. alas, you can have them not 'corded' and it is much easier to maintain.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It takes hours to dry a Komondor or Puli (not sure which one it is, my guess is Puli). I've heard about 12 hours. Plus you have to dry each dread individually. Also creating the appearance takes years of parting and maintaining. Once you have the pattern set and each dread about an inch wide, it maintains itself to an extent. They make great herding dogs, especially the black ones, because Hungarian farmers can see them easily inside their flock. They've even been known to jump on the back of the sheep just to get them to move. They're awesome.

It's a line I won't cross, I feel like in my soul I could only be monogamous. I won't be friends with him or try to be in a polyamorous relationship, not only e cause of this revaluation, but also I loved him too much, and the pain is too distracting.

Berating him was inexcusable, and I crave to learn more for other LGBT folk. I want to learn. Please, I know I may sound ignorant, I am on this subject. </TEXT>

Which is why I said most mind altering substances. Any who, they go to Nic-Free meetings and SA meetings and it just blows my freaking mind. They even have (G) meetings for people that don't smoke in West Hollywood.

That said, I want to thank you for being an inspiration and congrats. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As addicts, we are powerless. Marijuana is going to be on our minds forever. Might not be that strong, and it might not be very often, but anything could happen tomorrow.

As for me? My boyfriend still smokes. It sucks, but I really don't care and he doesn't rub it in my face. He doesn't do it around me, and when we were living together, he had his weed, bongs, and pipes in a separate cabinet that i wouldn't go in to.

Personally? I would not live with people that smoked weed that I wasn't in love with (as in people that I have been inside of, or have been inside of me... American Dad reference...) I know I'm a sucker for peer pressure. "Come on man, do it, do it, you know you love it." "Fuuuuuuuuuck, I do, how'd you know." **BAM** Almost a year down the drain. It hasn't happened. But it could.

If you can't move out or don't want to? Boundaries. And stick to them.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Congrats on coming to this conclusion! That's awesome to hear. I'll tell you a few things other people have told me.

If it's fucking you up, don't do it. Weed, alcohol, pills, whatever.

Don't worry about cigarettes. They aren't good for you, they cause health problems; that said, you have bigger fish to fry. Staying marijuana free, money, family, friends; if the future holds you not smoking, then it will happen.

We aren't fortune tellers. We don't know what tomorrow will bring. So brace yourself, and live a single day at a time. Sometimes a minute at a time.

Again, congrats.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Edit: I only identify as a recovering marijuana addict, though I've done other things. I choose complete sobriety of most mind altering substances.

My one year of sobriety is coming up soon. I don't usually open up about my journey too often, but today I had a moment. 
I went shopping for cold medicine, and caught myself actually reading ingredients.

"No, can't buy that for such and such reason."... "No, people get messed up on that"... "No, that'd make me feel weird, forget it"
I realized, not only do I feel like an old person, but I feel like a person that takes personal responsibility for what goes in to my body.
May it be cough medicine, or THC, or vodka, or that one weird pill my friend gave to me in high school at our church small group; sobriety is a complete overhaul of all of your previous beliefs, dispositions, and experiences.

I'm better for it.

With that, I still have no idea how I'm going to celebrate my one year, but I will.
