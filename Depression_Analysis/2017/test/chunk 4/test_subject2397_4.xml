	<TEXT> First off this might be long and I don't really expect anyone to read it...

Anyways, first time I read SP was a couple years ago or so and now I'm rereading them for about the 50th time.  And every time I read them I get this "feeling". And I think it's that I sort of relate to Scott in that I tend to elate things in my mind, and I'm also really clueless about girls emotions.  For example, Scott and Kim's relationship how she never stops caring about him. I know I've unintentionally led girls on in the past and I feel like a jerk about it. But by the end of SP we realize that everyone has done things in their past that were bad, or they regret, and it's a nice thought that you can move past that.

I also love the books because I (and I'm sure everyone) goes through the struggles of life (school etc.) and SP sortof has that simple carefree life and it reminds me to just not worry about things as much.

Anyways, those are just a couple reasons why the books are awesome. Maybe other people relate to the books in the same way, but either way thanks for readin </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I know a big thing in their minds seems to be that "you're just not the one" but seriously. Especially when they are already like 35 years old and it seems to me like they have everything except that one spark that it takes.  They do end up going on more date in season 6 (?) and at the end Ted says it's just not going to work. I guess it always just seemed a bit forced that they don't get together </TEXT>
