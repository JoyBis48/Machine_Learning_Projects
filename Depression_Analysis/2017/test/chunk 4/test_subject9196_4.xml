	<TEXT> Customization is coming, but Probably (at least in first update) outer ring won't be - only calendar colors, maybe background.

About tapping - working on it. Probably you would be happy.

	<TEXT> Sorry for copypasta mate but too many of you and I didn't slept in last 30h.
It is not a bug, at least not of my widget (heh, probably every dev is saying that). I can't get event after it was created, otherwise I would have to check database very often = battery drain. So I use minimal widget update time = 30minutes, and after that event will show up, or you can remove and add it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 1) Yes it is a problem, probably I will go with making borders around each event, and smaller event will be on top. Not ideal but almost close to it.
2)Color sync is on its way. Title/description would be hard, and I don't have ready answer to that. </TEXT>
