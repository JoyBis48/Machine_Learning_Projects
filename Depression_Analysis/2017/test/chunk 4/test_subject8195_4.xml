	<TITLE> The most real lucid dream I've ever had </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-05-24 07:08:57 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> This is my most vivid lucid dream I've ever had, and it's a bit long but I hope you stick along for the ride. I usually induce lucid dreaming by meditating before I sleep or sleeping with my arms at my sides repeating mantras and shit. This was by far my most successful lucid dream ever. Usually I just fall into sleep paralysis, which I'm also cool with, but this was way different. The dream felt like it spanned a year, but there were random patches in it and time skipped a lot. Well here goes.

I woke up in a cabin of sorts, like a mini hotel room. When I looked out of the window I saw stars. A lot of stars. I got up and walked over to the mirror. What I saw was a older version of myself. It looked like me, but aged ten years (right now I'm 17). 

Then, I heard a knocking on the door. I was startled to say the least. A raspy voice addressed me with "Mr." and my last name, very formally. When I opened the door I was greeted by one oft he cantina aliens from Star Wars (the cute ones that play the catchy song). He told me the train would arrive in the seventh dimension in three days after making a few stops. He said that I would have a business conference to attend. It was then I realized I was dressed fairly corporate casually with a dress shirt and khakis. I was really confused but I obliged and said okay.

When he left I exited the cabin and went down the hall until I found another door. When I opened it I was greeted by a large congregation area. There were a bunch of people talking, more cantina aliens, and other confusing aliens. Shuffling through the crowd I bumped into somebody. After apologizing profusely I realized it was a girl I knocked down. She smiled and said it was okay. She was absolutely beautiful and I was awe struck in all honesty. She had black hair and eyes like mine, almost hazel but brownish. She was dressed in casual clothes and had a sun hat on. I noticed a large camera in her hands.

I asked if she was alright and instead of answering the question she said, "No, I'm Alice, what's your name?" I told her my name and she said we should have coffee later. 

I don't remember having coffee, but I remember sitting on one of the benches in the area we were before. She told me she was taking a college art course and that her assignment was to take pictures of other dimensions. It was the I looked at the surroundings that were around the train. 

White. It was **vibrant** white, and there were trees of all different colors all around us. Blue, red, yellow. Every color of the rainbow. I remember this so clearly in my mind still. It was so fucking beautiful. She stood up and started taking pictures. Then, she smiled and asked me if I thought it was beautiful.

I was awe struck and said of course. She then asked me what I did for a living. I told her I was on my way to a business meeting in the seventh dimension. She frowned, and said that was boring. Then, she asked if I wanted to tag along with her. I remember thinking, "Screw it, it's my dream." and said yes.

Things got hazy after that, and I remember going to Mars, where it looked similar to Cowboy Bebop Mars. Then I only remember going to a strange cave dimension, because when we were there she got a call about something. Her cheery expression turned to a worried expression and she quickly hung up after agreeing with whoever was on the phone. 

After that, she said she had to go and said sorry. I asked her why and what was wrong. She told me that she was sorry and didn't get back on the train. I was very sad and confused after that, afterall I was in love. Or at least it felt like I was, and that was scary for me. 

Things got hazy again and I remember it was like a few years passed. I was at my grandpa's farm again, where I lived before my current house, but there were more futuristic cars. I was running an estate sale (when people go through a dead person's house and buy stuff) for the family. 

Then I saw her again. She walked up to the deck, wearing the same sun hat as before. I walked outside and walked up to her. She almost jumped and hugged me. I asked her how she was doing and if she wanted to catch up. She obliged and the next day we met up at my house. Or at least where my house is now, but it was an apartment complex. 

When she showed up I asked her how her art was doing and her expression faded. Then she told me something about how she had to be a prostitute for money and that all of those years ago she got a call about prostitute stuff. I don't remember the details but I remember asking her if she wanted to run away or stay with me. She looked up at me and smiled, but started to tear up a bit. 

She said she had to go and couldn't be with me. This was crushing and I felt terrible. I asked if she wanted to spend the night for one last night. 

After that all I remember was holding her in a dark apartment before waking up to my alarm, crying. It was so scary to me. I've never had a dream so real. It was the most real dream I've ever had. </TEXT>
