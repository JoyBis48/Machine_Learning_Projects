	<TEXT> INMO I left the movie saying the effects were phenomenal. There is more to a movie then special effects. Gravity sweeped a lot of awards but I think also why 12 years a slave won because of the story itself.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> So, how do I tell my parents that I been having suicidal thoughts? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-02-27 19:09:38 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So ever since November, I have not been the same. My dad cancer has spread even more and it made me in a darker place that I thought I would never be in. I get up every morning with nothing to really look forward too. The only thing that gets me excited is movies and TV shows which is really sad but honestly the truth. I used to love Skiing and I just went for a few days, but its not the same as it used to be. I told my social worker what I have been feeling down and thinking suicidal thoughs which come and go away, but now she is scared for me. Which makes it worse. She wants me to go book an appt with the doctor and she wants me to tell my parents. My parents know nothing, they think I'm a happy go lucky girl who likes to make others laugh, but when I get home and go into my room its a whole other thing. A part of me just thinks its my head talking and I may not actually be depressed but i have no idea. I just don't want to be judged you know.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Thoughts on Endless Love (2014) remake? (SPOILERS) </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-02-24 06:30:16 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So again another friend took me go to see Endless Love. I saw the trailer and I didn't really want to see it as well it didn't do so well on Rotten Tomatoes. The only movie I really want to go see is Veronica Mars, but any how it is not a bad movie. Obviously, it is no where as good as the Notebook or Walk To Remember. It was a cute, romantic movie and the scene where the main female character gets in a car accident scared the living crap out of me. Has anyone seen the 1981 one with Brooke Shields?  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Anyone saw Pompeii (2014)? Let's talk about it! (SPOILERS) </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-02-23 21:55:27 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So my friends made me see Pompeii in 3D. The film in my opinion was a huge miss and I will forget I even watched this movie because nothing stood out in the movie. It is so obvious what was going to happen. Kiefer Sutherland and Kit Harington star in this flop movie. The effects and the music were good, but the acting and the storyline was lacking. And I just realized that the poster for Pompeii that is on IMDb is actually from the last scene of the movie. So you don't even need to watch the movie you can just look at the poster and you know what will happen. Kiefer Sutherland accent was terrible and he should stick to what he knows which is playing Jack Bauer and shooting people with a gun. What did you think of the movie? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Okay, so I try to watch as many as I can because I find if I don't watch any at all the award shows are boring. Plus there are some really good movies out there. I have seen every movie that has won main awards and I have seen 80% of all best picture noms. So I look at the Golden Globes or Oscar nominee list and I just check off the ones I've seen. Blue Jasmine is a movie you do not want to miss. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I always look at Rotten Tomatoes, because it shows combined with users and critics if the movie is good or not. It does affect the way you watch the film because if you go on a site that says the movie rating is low you will have low expectations of the movie and may not be motivated to watch it, but its the same with good ratings such as American Hustle. American Hustle got great ratings and I was so excited about it, but when I watched it I was bummed because I had such a high expectations of the film because of the cast, director and the great reviews. When I watched it, it did not reach up to its expectations. It's good to know if the movie is worth watching with the ratings, but don't take it too strongly all the time because sometimes a movie that is rotten is actually one of my favourite movies. So it all depends on the individual.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So I just got into House of Lies. Honest truth, there is so much better TV material out there. This is not the best or the worst. It's the entertaining, it takes a while to get into the series. I would watch a few more to decide  if you want to continue on or not because it does get more interesting as eps goes on. Kristen Bell INMO kills it by far then the rest of the cast. There so many great lines in the show worth watching. I say give it one more try </TEXT>
