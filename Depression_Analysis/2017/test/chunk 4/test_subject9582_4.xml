	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> A painting contractor was speaking with a woman about a job. In the first room, she said she would like a pale blue. The contractor wrote this down and went to the window, opened it, and yelled out "GREEN SIDE UP!" In the second room, she told the painter she would like it painted in a soft yellow. He wrote this on his pad, walked to the window, opened it, and yelled "GREEN SIDE UP!" The lady was somewhat curious but she said nothing. In the third room, she said she would like it painted a warm rose color. The painter wrote this down, walked to the window, opened it and yelled "GREEN SIDE UP!" The lady then asked him, "Why do you keep yelling 'green side up'?"
"I'm sorry," came the reply.
"But I have a crew of blondes laying sod across the street." </TEXT>

They cannot talk, and sentient means you are aware that you are alive. (are dementors alive?)

	<TEXT> Albus Dumbledore explains that it is unwise to make a horcrux from a living thing (Nagini) because all you have to do is destroy the container beyond repair, and it isn't hard to kill something alive.

Harry was not a *true* horcrux anyway, they require an enchantment/ritual to make and he did not do that in 1981. When Riddle used his blood in the graveyard, that kept Harry alive as long as Voldemort was because he used Lily's blood and her sacrifice, so it worked as sort of an anti-horcrux for Harry. </TEXT>

Ron found out about the taboo after he had left the other two in the Forest of Dean. </TEXT>

As he waits to get the bartender's attention, a regular sitting next to him calls out, "I'll have another waterloo."

So the bartender brings the newcomer a tall ice cold drink. The man takes a long deep drink and calls out, "HEY! This isn't any good. It tastes just like water!"
The regular bar patron sitting next to him says, "It is water. That's all I drink," He turns to the bartender and says, "Right Lou?" </TEXT>

I'm sure they could attract even the straightest of women, supposing that it was a female Veela. Or the same for male Veela really. It's just their charm. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would have a blue smoke dispensary called Sorcerer's Smoke.

We would have many locations throughout the wizarding world, some in muggle villages disguised as normal smoke shops.

Sorcerer's Smoke would cater to those that need a bit of relaxation in their lives, and has just recently come on to the open market.

Our claim to fame would be the many visits by the Dumbledore brothers, and a few more notable aurors in the early underground days. Sorcerer's Smoke used to be a secret on the black market before we became a bit more main stream.

When you walk into our homey shop, you will have your choice of almost fifty blue varieties to help any witch or wizard relax no matter what mood they may be in.

The walls are lined with plush couches and chairs to sink into while you enjoy your wares, so come on down to Sorcerer's Smoke, and relax after a long day!
