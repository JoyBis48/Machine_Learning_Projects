	<TEXT> I like to think what happened was, when you were young, you heard your mom or someone else talk about your great grandfather's funeral, and the whole thing just stayed in your sub-conscious. It then later someday returned perhaps in your dream which later felt like a memory.

Or

When you were young, you were sleeping while someone was talking about the funeral. You were perhaps in the REM stage of the sleep and were dreaming exactly what was being described by that person. That way you got a first person perspective of the whole thing and now remember it as a memory.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> How is that personal information, explain? A number used to scam people is personal information? Which when made publicly available will "harm"  the owner of that number? Is that what you are implying? 
Also, no one is shaming anyone here. We are trying to prevent such a scenario from taking place in the future. 
/u/oldmonq you should post the number. Or else, what's even the point of this trend?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't think the mods will mind in this case. And it's not like the number is some "personal information" of the scammer. Post the number so that we can at least report it on truecaller.  </TEXT>
