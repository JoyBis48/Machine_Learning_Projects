	<TEXT> [srs] i mean she spent hundreds on the knockoffs to review them for people who cant afford a $58 UD palette. it was no different  then all the regular hauls and swatches MUA users post with their brand-name items. it was just a silly thing for people to get mad about...  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Wow I wish I looked like you when I was 14! I was rocking the raccoon eyeliner and concealer as foundation look... I think a nice bold winged liner could really draw attention to your eyes. Also, if youre a beginner with eye shadow, just find a nice pink shade that looks feminine (not hot pink or anything hahah) and dab that on the lid for a "fresh" look, then apply winged liner. Its good for someone your age and not too over-the-top! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Your brows have a nice shape but they seem really thin... I would recommend looking into filling them in to give you a "fuller", more natural look. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Maybe its just me but I rarely ever see anyone do swatches/hauls/FOTD with a Melt Cosmetics product. I have two of their lipsticks in Blow and DGAF and they're gorgeous and perfect for the price! But I have barely seen anyone on MUA review them, which is weird because id expect Melt to be raved over because of the quality and price... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well... long story short... her 4,000 instagram followers told her she looked hideous so then she decided to go for an "editorial" look and she grew out her eyebrows and brushed the hairs upwards, which looks even sillier. So the answer is no. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have medium beige skin with a slight olive undertone, and I'm really lusting over Coven but I'm not sure I could pull it off with my complexion. Could anyone with a similar skin tone comment with some swatches or with you wearing Coven so I can an idea?
