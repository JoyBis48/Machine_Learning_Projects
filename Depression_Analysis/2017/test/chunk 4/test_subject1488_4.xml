	<TEXT> I've become a little more apathetic. I think this has to do with my ability to get 3.0 GPA (minimum) without trying AT ALL. I'm very good at playing the system, and my college is not hard in general. So, I really don't care about walking out of class or skipping or giving a fuck about what I wear, how people perceive me, how many friends I have on campus, etc. If i feel it's not worth my time, i won't show up. If I think a professor is ridiculous I won't show up or I'll let my voice be heard. I guess this is part of adulthood and synonymous with independence.

Also, I learned it's okay to think outside the box and your opinions actually ARE what professors want to hear. I've been lucky to take a handful of classes with professors that let you (and expect you) to be free with your thought. Some of the things I wrote seem like I'm high out of my mind, but it's really just me digging deeper and making connections that I've been forced to not look into in other classes. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Have you talked to your doctor about antidepressants? They often help with anxiety all together, rather than a quick fix like xanax. Same with your focus, really will help on a low dose.

I've been on my share of antidepressants that have changed my levels of anxiety. I've found when I'm on a pill that completely removes anxiety, I am unproductive and boring. Anxiety kind of forces me to multitask and complete things fully and quickly. I manage every little detail which is why I do so well, esp at jobs.

If you can't do it alone colt turkey, try lupe or kratom. If that doesn't work, get suboxone from a sub clinic.. Of course rehab is a possibility.

	<TEXT> I think you new to do some soul searching. Explore, spend time alone, spend time with strangers, travel, take up new hobbies or volunteer. After this, Make a list of your positive traits and what you find you like or value. 

If you don't have a job, get one even if it's not a "career" and work hard at it to make you feel confident. Plus it takes time away from dwelling on your problems and puts your energy into something else other than anxiety.

Think about your "virgin" situation. Do you want to have sex for yourself or because you think it's what you NEED to do (just like you NEED to get a job out of college)? If it's the former, go right ahead and pursue that but know it's not going to solve any problems.

Other than that, someone once told me to not worry about what you're going to do to create happiness for the rest of your life but rather focus on what makes you happy in your current life. (I probably and wording this wrong) 

Good luck I've been there and overcome some of the problems that you've mentioned but still right there with you on others.

I actually live near next to 6 and think 7 is also a great place to live if you like heat.

You can get a job where I live as a waiter anywhere. 1600E is $2000+ America? That'd get you a pretty good apartment here with at least $500 spending money. But this obv changes by location in the US. I'd say the average where I like is $1000USD, so maybe 800E.

Up north, you don't really feel the racism. Down South, it's a little different. I wouldn't really say it's that racist or segregated, but people do have different views than what us in the North view difference races. What you hear about shootings happen, but no, it's not like that. There's rape and mugging but it's not something we should be known for. Inner cities you'll find more or it.

Don't live in Compton or NYC.

It saves money and gets you focused, both with the college atmosphere and your future wants and needs. If you wanna be away, you can always get an apartment, rent out a room near a college and be on your own. </TEXT>
