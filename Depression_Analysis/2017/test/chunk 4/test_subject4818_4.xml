	<TEXT> Overkill. 
Playing Big Oil with 3 pubs, one of them was a infamy 5 when it was the top, and we just barely finished it. 
Of coarse the highest level guy lead us all the way until the end of the last day when we had to bag up the right engine. 

We all stupidly bagged up each engine (first time playing it) and he got mad and left. Threw some nads at us and left. 

So i grabbed a bag and left for the helicopter and waited while the other guys went down and wanted to restart the mission. 
 
I waited out the storm and handed off the first bag and then prayed to god. And then jt happened, first bag was right! 
The other guys freaked out as I ran and made it out. Ahh, that was good.  </TEXT>
