Also, there's another one about film vs.digital cameras, the evolution of them both, which is better and why and where they are both going as in the future. It's called by Side by Side. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> American Beauty and Fight Club made me have a completely different outlook on life. After watching those films, I decided that I would NOT get a job where I'm stuck in an air conditioned room for hours on end doing a job I hate. I thought that waking up every morning at 7:00 and driving to the same place in the same clothes doing the same shit was NOT the definition of life and living. Unfortunately, I find myself looking down at these people who are stuck in this world; prisoners unto themselves and their jobs. I need to live, I can't be held back by working for people I despise. I want to be a cinematographer, a job where I can be outside and in different environments using my hands and skills to create films; a job where I meet different people, a job that I can learn and grow into.

Also, [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipe6CMvW0Dg) youtube video also helped shape my new way of thinking.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah true. When the new 'It' remake comes out, I think it'll be very very good. It might have what your looking for, as it is about friendship and growing up, just with an evil ass demonic alien in there somewhere. (The book) is a beautiful coming of age story, I highly recommend it. But yeah the movie when it comes out will be just what you're looking for if it's good, which I'm sure it will be.
(I mean come on, the remake is written and will be directed by the same guy who did True Detective!) </TEXT>

He'll do over a hundred takes of a scene just to get it right, I think people need to appreciate that. Apparently the other 2 are still going to happen, which makes me very happy. If you liked this then definitely check out his other films, especially Zodiac.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The statue is not CGI, or the graffiti.

At some point in the film, public opinion will go against superman. Maybe something will happen, I don't know. 

When that 'something' happens, that's arguably where Bats comes into it.

People will turn against Superman in this movie, he might lose friends, politicans will want him, the military will want to contain him, all sorts of variables have been brought into the game as described by the teaser. So despite all this, will superman lose it? Will he lose faith in humanity? How do we know he won't be influenced by a villain, or be corrupted in some sort of way? The theory is that batman will be this sort of test, physically he wouldn't be much of a test, but mentally he would be.  </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2015-04-18 12:23:13 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Instead of exhausting Batman's origin story, put him in a completely new setting with characters and themes that we haven't seen before.
I was thinking of a Arkham Asylum-ish story. Never have we seen Batman psychologically torn, put him right in the middle of insanity, and see how he pushes through it. Now THAT would be interesting.

For those of you who don't know, Arkham Asylum: A serious house on serious earth is a graphic novel, arguably one of the most disturbing and dark. Basically what it is about is there has been an outbreak in AA and Batman has been requested by the Joker, so he has to go over there to sort everything out. Ultimately, it's a psychological horror book. 

The book deals with themes of insanity, and it literally looks like and is meant to symbolize a nightmarish ordeal. What I am trying to get to is that this would be a completely new on-screen reincarnation of the character.

 I think we need to see a human, vulnerable and scared batman.
Maybe we've already seen that with Nolan's trilogy, but I just really want to see Batman and insanity in the same movie together, and to see how he deals with it and vice versa.

Also, I think going with this tone and story, would bring a completely different take on the DC villains. So batman locks up these villains in insane asylums and prisons, then what? They are left to whither and die in filthy and disgusting environments. Seeing this I think would be brilliant. 

Let me know your thoughts! I would love to hear other people's opinions on this. Yes I know, I am no writer. If you still don't know what I am trying to say, just comment or PM me, I'll be happy to elaborate.

TL;DR- I want to see [this](http://www.merlininkazani.com/images/games/7764/galeri_4.jpg) on screen. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I recently watched the documentary 'The Kingdom of Dreams and Madness'. **SPOILER AHEAD** It says at the end that he has retired, but on his retirement sheet/form or whatever it says that he wishes to continue making anime for 10 more years. What does this mean? Is he working on something right now? I am so confused, I have found so many different things on the internet about what is going on with him. Can somebody PLEASE explain what is happening? Thanks so much!!

**I DON'T WANT HIM TO RETIRE :'(** </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I find that when I talk to people I sound snobby and selfish. I feel like the tone of how I talk sounds like only my opinion matters. I do not have any of these intentions however, It's just how I feel I sound. How do I get rid of this? I don't want to come off any selfish to people, as I am not a selfish person. Any help would be much appreciated, if you want me to elaborate further just ask! Much Thanks! </TEXT>

I just stared at it for 30 seconds straight. Then, as plain as a robot, I put the normal bluray back onto the shelf, walked towards the 10th anniversary edition, picked it up bought it, and marched out of the shop. My face was as blank as paper. </TEXT>
