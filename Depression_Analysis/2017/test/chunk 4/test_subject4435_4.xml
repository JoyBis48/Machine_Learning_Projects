	<TEXT> Format please. Text block is really hard to read. I had a hard time with it with my own post but if you hit enter twice at the end of a paragraph you'll get the space you need.
Edit: Made it through. Put a salt circle around your bed and your son's rock and play. Update us asap please. :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This advice is probably gonna get me all kinds of flack BUT when my insomnia got to the point I couldn't function and I was seeing stuff, I started smoking a joint before bed every night, taking a sleeping pill with a cup of tea, and listening to really quiet classical music til I fell asleep. I eventually weaned myself off the routine but I still struggle with getting to sleep. I hope you can beat this OP. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't think I've ever smoked up at 4:20pm or am. It was always at like lunch time during school, or 11 or 12 at night right before bed. 

OP, I've heard that if someone you know calls your name, you should wait until they do it a second time, because the first is the devil or something trying to get your attention.  As for the doorbell, I've had it happen a few times. Always when I'm distracted, and there's other noise happening. Never had an explanation for it though. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It could just be me. It's habit to look for messages. It's just that they're so well written any mistake seems deliberate, you know? In Back In The Alley there's a place where it says "of" but it should say "some." Also in that one, 6th paragraph, there's the word "bar" but the "a" is missing. If you come up with anything else, can you let me know?
