	<TEXT> I think it has more to do with certain State fans thinking their football program was better because it jumped to FBS after one season. We never played each other until 2014 and apparently that made us Eagles look like we were 'scared.'

This was then further exacerbated by clueless announcers calling Georgia Southern Georgia State on multiple occasions. [Friendly PSA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=putYM15zC0Y) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No, but that's where it began.

	<TITLE> Trying to nail down my HS Day Schedule/FP+ </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-02-01 20:45:44 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hello friends. I am trying to determine if I am making a HUGE mistake. I think I have decided to risk NOT FP+ing Toy Story Midway Mania. I know, I know! Let me explain.

We have an 8:25 AM Galactic Dine In Star Wars Breakfast Reservation at the Sci Fi Dine In Restaurant for May 6. The park opens at 9. Since I can either FP+ Toy Story or the Rockin Roller Coaster, I think I am going to chance it and take the Roller Coaster since we are so close to Toy Story in the park. I don't want to rush through the breakfast either though so I guess my question is, how soon after 9 AM does the line become unbearable for Toy Story? I have done it before, and it was WONDERFUL and my SO has never done it (and I know he would love it). 

What do you think? Thanks in advance and may the force be with you! </TEXT>
