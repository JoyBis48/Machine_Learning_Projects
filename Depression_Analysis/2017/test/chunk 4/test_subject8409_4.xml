	<TEXT> Many of the original artifacts from the Neo-Assyrian King Ashurnasirpal II are actually located in The British Museum in England. Some of  Iraqs' are duplicates.

Here's photos of what's in The British Museum
 
http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlights_search_results.aspx?searchText=Palace+of+Ashurnasirpal+II


Al Jazeera reporter on Twitter said

[**jane arraf
"@janearraf
ISIL has moved on #Nimrud - the Assyrian palace near #Mosul. Sources there say they used bulldozer to level winged bull statues Thursday"**](https://twitter.com/janearraf/status/573573370119262208)

There's a Colossal statue of a winged human-headed bull from the North-West Palace of Ashurnasirpal II in The British Museum and its partner is now in the Metropolitan Museum, New York.

see 

http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/me/c/colossal_statue_winged_bull.aspx

The  colossal statue winged bull you see being destroyed with sledgehammers  in the ISIS video looks to me like a duplicate.

**At age 11**

**Family gathering** 

Eleven-year-old Mark Harman of London provides a firm footing for his mother and sister as he relaxes on the bed of nails. Mark has studied the ancient eastern art for a few years as a hobby, but lately has been complaining about the rising cost of nails.

**SHARP PROBLEM** 

Mark Harman, 11 experiences no pain as he lies on a bed of 400 nails while doing his homework. Aided by his brother and sister, who sit atop mark reading a book, Mark practices half an hour each day stretched out on the bed of nails. The London, England youngster was taught yogi.

Pro ISIS Asawitiri media's 104th Twitter account was just suspended. Shutting them down doesn't do much except make a few armchair twitter anti-jihadists feel good about themselves for mass reporting. 

I don't know how they got the number 46,000. I'd think it's impossible to give a conclusive number of how many 'real' supporters they have on twitter because many twitter accounts are actually run by terrorism analysts and government agency's for analysis, to gain access to their online forums and for other reasons. </TEXT>

Al Jazeera's Jane Arraf tweeted that they used a bulldozer to level the winged bull statue. I think that statue might be an imitation. The British Museum has one and it's partner is now in the Metropolitan Museum, New York.

	<TEXT> It seems the PLO is not happy with this.

They [decided today to end security cooperation with Israel](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/2y22ko/the_palestinian_liberation_organisations_central/). 


This leaves the 92,000 Palestinians who worked for Israelis and had a 55% average increase in salary over their peers in the Palestinian territories  at risk of losing their jobs.

It's hard for me to comprehend the sick logic behind this .

-
Just now I read on twitter that a PA Official was quoted as saying

"The decision to suspend security coordination with Israel was not taken by the Palestinian Authority and is just a **recommendation**"

Maybe it was just a bluff

And our ministry as it denounces and condemns these criminal acts calls upon the UN Security Council to speed up the convening of its emergency and activate its previous relevant resolutions and to support Iraq

Represents the first line of defense against this attack and the need to put an end to this tragic situation, which passes by the civilized world and stand with us against the enemies of civilization and humanity

The [agreement](http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/official_texts_25457.htm) cites, 

NATO vows to respect Ukraine's sovereignty, i.e. not to invade it, and it's member states will "consult together" if the country is threatened.

It would be a non issue 'if' American troops were involved in protecting Ukraine's sovereignty. While Russia must abide to the NATO vows and not attack Ukraine's sovereignty. This is why on 1 April 2014, NATO decided to suspend practical co-operation with Russia. </TEXT>

92,000 Palestinians disagree with you. They worked in Israels private sector until now and were happy with it. The decision to stop security cooperation's with Israel is PLO politics.  

Israeli government 

Most if not all work in the private sector

whom withholds $100,000,000 in tax revenue

Although I disagree with Israels practice, Hamas has 209.7 million dollars of electricity payments taken from Palestinians that rightfully belong to Israel's electricity company

thus punishing millions of people.

It's mostly Hamas who is punishing the people

Seems that the 92k workers are fed up of the gangster liar Israeli government

	<TEXT> Cattle walking the last mile to this slaughterhouse are treated to this dazzling, but incongruous display of light before the end in Gross-Umstadt near Darmstadt, West Germany, on November 29, 1962. The chandelier came from a nearby factory that didn't have room to assemble it there, so they decided to assemble it in this slaughterhouse. The name of the Arab ruler who ordered the 532 bulb chandelier made up of 200,000 separate parts is a secret. Also, a secret is the price he paid for it.

**Fancy Lights For A Slaughterhouse**

This incongruous scene-a bull and exptionally fancy chandelier-was at a slaughterhouse in Gross Umstadt, West Germany. The firm that made the chandlier-three and a half tons and with 532 bulbs-stored it at the packing house pending shipment. It is to be instslled at a new ballroom </TEXT>
