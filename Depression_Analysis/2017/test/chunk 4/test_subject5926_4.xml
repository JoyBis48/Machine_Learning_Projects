	<TEXT> Hello everyone,
sooo I have this problem with pop-out windows all of them have [THIS] (http://imgur.com/D13f8Zb) weird kind of visual bug.  
I tried to disable all addons (also deleted and redownloaded them again) and I ran the scan and repair in launcher. I would rather not reinstall the whole game, so Im asking if anyone has some experience.  
Sorry if this doesnt belong here and also thanks for all the responses. </TEXT>
