	<TEXT> Na we have "hollers" here in TN. I've live here for about 10 years and haven't really figured out if there is a defined landscape that makes a holler a holler or if the places they call holler are just called that because the road names are named such. For example "hog hollow rd" is a road name in this county and that area is generally referred to as hog holler.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've been up to Mountain City a few times and the path from Johnson City to Mountain City that goes up by Watauga Lake is absolutely gorgeous. I've always wanted to go out on that lake.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's awesome! I love living near mountains. I'm not sure if I'd want to live anywhere else. Just about everyday I see something that I haven't noticed before. I hate when they go bare as well. Way more beautiful in the summertime when everything is green. </TEXT>
