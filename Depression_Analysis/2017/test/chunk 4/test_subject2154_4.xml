	<TEXT> To me, the popularity of YA novels has a lot to do with the accessibility of the emotion in them. It doesn't tend to be couched in philosophy or overly complicated (which is not to say they can't be emotionally nuanced); it's just that the characters feel in a way that resonates with how people feel. 

A lot of the time in literary/more serious fiction, the book is exploring those emotions and what makes them work/how they come to pass/how we can understand those emotions more. Which is hard work that a lot of people don't want to do or are intimidated by.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Trout is a pretty funny guy. He's normal as hell, but that doesn't mean he has no personality.

Pujols' persona is a machine, but even then he goofs off with everybody. He's just not that way to the media because he doesn't want to be.

	<TEXT> I'm not saying your content is wrong or unwarranted; it's totally vaild analysis. Your tone is just overly hostile. It's extremely common for fans of a particular CBB team to knee-jerk and say that a guy isn't ready for the next level when they declare their intentions to leave. People wanted to see him stay (for selfish reasons), and they're upset that's not gonna happen. I'm not sure if you've read the other threads in here with players declaring, but every fan base does it. It's silly and short-sighted, but it doesn't deserve a curb-stomping. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Because there was no fielding error committed on the first play, but there was on the second play. First play is two steals, second play is a steal and a throwing error.

It's definitely not reflective of what actually happened (incompetence on both plays), but since no one physically misplayed the ball, there is no error. A similar situation is when a fly ball drops between two people who both thought the other person had it. Obviously it should've been caught, but no one dropped/missed it, so it can't be counted as an error.

TLDR: Fielding errors have too narrow of a defintion, so sometimes people get rewarded with stats even though dumb plays were made. </TEXT>

Debate how you will about the ACC vs. Big East. I think the ACC is definitely better; that much better I don't think I'd agree with.

We can agree to disagree about being impressed with Nova. It's quite possible that you and I just watched them on different days and saw different things. Your opinion was certainly vindicated as much as it can be in a single-elimination tournament. I just stand by the reasoning that NC State is an extremely talented basketball team who can beat anyone when playing well, Villanova played awful, and they still almost won the game. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They had their best player, 7 footer Robert Upshaw with NBA talent, kicked off the team in December and then nosedived into badness.

Saying they played a bunch of crappy teams and nosedived is just not knowing what happened this year at all. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Those games are 50/50. I wouldn't beat yourself up over it too much, pick the teams you like best. I have three 9s and an 8, but realistically, any of those teams can win. None of them are horrible match-ups for the other, and none of them are over or under seeded too much. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have them in the Elite 8. It's not an easy road at all, but they have the best player in the regional in Kris Dunn. That's a damn useful thing </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Just my thoughts haha. Look, gun to my head, I'm taking Kentucky. But those two things make Wisconsin a very tough team. That's essentially them firing on all cylinders. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not really buying the haven't faced an elite team deal. 

Wisconsin has played one elite team, Duke, who they lost to at home in a great game. 

Kentucky has played one elite team, Kansas, who they eviscerated before Kansas had really figured out how to play together. 

Virginia lost to Duke at home in a great game. 

Duke won at Virginia and at Wisconsin, easily the best two wins this season, but also lost to/played close games against teams much their inferior. 

Arizona played one, a home win against Gonzaga in OT. Gonzaga obviously played the same one.

Each of these teams, with the exception of Duke, has 1 elite game. Which half of them lost. Why does that all the sudden make them head and shoulders above Villanova? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Fox is pushing that angle because they want to raise the value of their properties (the Big East). If everyone thinks it's a joke, no one will bother heading to FS1 to watch it. So when ESPN says the Big East is overrated, Fox needs to push back with why they would say that. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So is his last name really pronounced Toke-O-Toe like Jay Bilas and the rest of ESPN says it? I have a visceral reaction to it every time, cuz I feel like it should be pronounced Toko-Doe...

these are the things I think about </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Both offensive juggernauts, but Gonzaga has size in a way Iowa State can't really match, would be my quick take. But Iowa State has a way of getting on these unstoppable runs. Depends what you trust. </TEXT>
