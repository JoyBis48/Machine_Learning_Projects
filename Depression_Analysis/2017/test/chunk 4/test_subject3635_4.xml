	<TEXT> Great places to live. I don't like those crazy winters though, my body is not used to it so moving there isn't something I might consider. But the people are good. Women are gorgeous. Education system is probably the best in the world in the Scandinavian countries, primarily Finland. We in India can certainly learn a lot from it. 

Also since most people there can speak English it's easy to communicate with 'em.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Delhi university. A few years ago I was walking outside the department of commerce when I saw a group of Haryanvi guys mocking some NE students for no reason whatsoever. 
One guy started making those Bruce Lee kung-fu noises and I'm pretty sure the NE students heard it but did not respond.
