	<TEXT> I've never hired a prostitute but I'm working on a short story which requires it so here we are. 

My assumption is that maby sex workers would be bored and do a bad job hiding it or they'd try too hard to be pleasant. Which of these is more accurate (if either of them is true to life at all.)   </TEXT>

	<TITLE> How would you recommend adapting this story for a short video? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-11-27 01:16:10 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Okay, I am in talks with the [White with Red](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tl4kgoeSbNo) director to adapt a short story. It's tentatively entitled "Please God" but that may change. 
[Here's the story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Up2JBb_d8GY)

TL:DW: a guy wakes up in a room strapped to a bed. Someone comes in and tortures him purportedly because he was having an affair with the wrong person's wife but actually because this is the torturer's fetish and the tortured person is indulging him because he thought this would be the ultimate act of love. 

So, which of these approaches would you recommend: 

A. Prolonged POV shots (Not a gopro, I think those tend to shake too much to properly simulate vision) to make it more immersive. 

B. With conventional multiple camera setups because then people pay less attention to how the video is being shot and more to the story and acting. 

Thank you for your time.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I understand this is borderline out of the question unless I guess some company thought they could knock out the big names and replace them with their own to make the games essentially long ads. I guess it's more about whether you really need that footage of gameplay to really know how good a game is. 

Personally speaking I've never really just rushed out and bought a game on the basis of a Let's Play video versus a written review or a trailer, but this isn't about me.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Taken from username Cookie Monster's comment on an article about the movie: 

"One more thing that make Star Wars work so well, that only just occur to me for first time, is that it not try and shoehorn in romance. Luke and Han both flirt with Leia, but story never about one of them getting girl. Leaving that storyline to Empire Strikes Back work well, because second installment not have to do as much world-building and have room for romantic subplot. But it also make Leia something other than prize for hero to get at end of movie. When she and Han do get together, they on equal footing, because first movie already establish her as independent person.

	<TEXT> I was bullshitting with my brother about the show while we were doing an errand and we mentioned the whole "Lyra/Bon Bon" thing. He wondered if you could show like a same sex couple in the show. Not something like it's central to the episode and it becomes a very special episode which would bore the shit out of kids, but they're just there and maybe they've adopted a kid or something. 

On that note, since there are a lot of conservative parents out there that watch the show, are there any controversies like that or was it only the Brony thing that kicked up any dust?  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Sarah Can't Be Real </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-11-16 22:33:13 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> 
I saw Sarah and heard her many times before I believed she could be real. She hid in shadows, edges, and in corners of my vision. I would hear walking quietly and cautiously around the house at night--breathing, crawling through the attic, everywhere. Sometimes she would shriek or weep for some time. Everytime I saw her, she was carrying some kind of stuffed animal with her. She was here when I moved into the house. Shell be here as long as the house stands, perhaps longer. 

I know why Sarahs here. I learned about it by reading up on my home at local history at the library. What I read in this old newspapers... well, I had thought I experienced a bad childhood, but compared to hers mine was idyllic. Her father would be revealed by a postmortem to have suffered from a brain tumor at the time when he went mad. His madness drove her mother to leave the home, and he seemed to direct his rage towards his own body and her. She was not allowed to leave the home for her last few days as he became obsessed with a butcher knife. He apparently found many occasions to use it on her and himself. . 

Her life ended in something Ive seen reenacted many times now. On the last night, holding her stuffed bear to give her courage, she walked out into the hallway, a cut on the back of her hand opening as she squeezed it. She went to ask her father to let her leave the house. He must have gotten up and killed her then, because when this part of the haunting happens, she falls on the floor and begins to bleed out. 

I first saw her... reliving this experience that I finally believed she was real. When I saw her walk in to the living room that night, she was not a mere ghost of light or smoke. She was as physical as I was, though I still dont understand how that was possible. She was looking off to my left as she begged her father to let her leave even though I didnt see any sign he was present. 

I let this happen to her once. The second time she came down the hallway to beg the empty air to let her leave. I yelled at her to run but she didnt seem to acknowledge me. When she stopped her plea, which meant her death was imminent. I ran over, picked her up without thinking about the implications of what it meant, and carried her away.

I was expecting what I did to mean nothing: That she would just bleed and die in my arms again. But apparently, somehow, moving the body she had beyond reason from the room prevented her from dying again. I put her down in the bathroom and she was looking up at me, still alright 

I can hardly claim to be her savior, though. Shes still dead. A short time after I carried out of the living room, she still faded away and resumed the same pattern of haunting the house, even the part involving walking into the living room to ask her father to let her leave, as if nothing had happened. Well, almost. 

Just an hour ago, she came into the living room again, looking the same as always and holding a stuffed animal the same as every other time. She looked like she was strangling it. I had moved the chair to where her father must have had his, and she looked me in the eyes as she approached. 
	
Hello, Sarah, I said as I got up. 	

No. Please, no, Sarah begged as I approached. 

Theres no one but me who has to see her. Theres almost no one who would believe this pretty little girl is still on this plane of existence. No wonder I didnt believe she was real. 

How could I be so lucky?

Some of these are more obscure than others. I think my favorite is the thing about how there were a bunch of fake Chaplins. Kinda interesting how these days you see knockoffs of popular movies like Transmorphers and Kiara the Brave but back then it was about counterfeit actors.  </TEXT>

While I saw some things that in hindsight were very well-designed such as A Link to the Past and that sort of thing, it never really leapt out at me as beautiful-looking or what not. 

I didn't ever play it as a child, but I was surprised when I looked back on it at how well the graphics of The Curse of Monkey Island held up when I tried them a little while ago. I also liked some of the stuff in King's Quest V more than I would have expected for how primitive it is and for how difficult some of the gameplay can be.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was watching Robocop (80s version) for the first time. There's the character of Bob Morton who is presented as this complete sleaze, a really lame guy when he tells Murphy "You are gonna be a bad motherfucker!" and all that, but towards the end, I kind of found myself liking him anyway even though he was clearly supposed to be unlikable and usually I wouldn't like a character of that type. It was odd. 

Ever felt that?  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Which of these two approaches would you recommend for shooting this horror short? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> I and a guy in Las Vegas are in preproduction on a short based on this story: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Up2JBb_d8GY (with permission from the author)

The TL:DW of it is that the story is about a guy being tortured because he had sex with the wrong guy's wife. 

Now, if it were your job to shoot this, would you take: 


Option A: Shoot it conventionally with closeups, fairly conventional shot lengths, etc. 

Option B: POV shots from the victim's perspective, ideally only two of them if possible. 

I imagine I don't need to go into any details about the pros and cons of each option.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm still a fan of their comedy style, but while I was watching their track for The Dark Knight, I honestly decided about a quarter way through to just turn theirs off and just watch the movie. There are flaws to be found in the movie, but I believe it's well enough made that even the jokey nitpicks aren't very entertaining.  </TEXT>
