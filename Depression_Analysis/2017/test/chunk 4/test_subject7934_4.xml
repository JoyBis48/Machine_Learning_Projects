	<TEXT> [Krugman talks about that here](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/03/opinion/krugman-not-enough-inflation.html):

 Why is low inflation a problem? One answer is that it discourages borrowing and spending and encourages sitting on cash. Since our biggest economic problem is an overall lack of demand, falling inflation makes that problem worse.

 Low inflation also makes it harder to pay down debt, worsening the private-sector debt troubles that are a main reason overall demand is too low.

 **So why is inflation falling? The answer is the economys persistent weakness, which keeps workers from bargaining for higher wages and forces many businesses to cut prices.** And if you think about it for a minute, you realize that this is a vicious circle, in which a weak economy leads to too-low inflation, which perpetuates the economys weakness.

	<TEXT> Yeh, it's pretty clear that both parties are doing it.  The Democrats have been taken over by carpet bagging globalists like the Clintons who get the votes of the rank-and-file by pushing left wing social issues.  The Republicans have always catered to the rich and sell their message using (now discredited) trickle down economics and right wing social issues.

So it could be argued that Warren is incorrect and just banging the partisan drums.  However, an alternative view  is that she's repositioning and rebranding the Democratic party - away from the ideas of Clinton/Obama and towards *economic* left wing issues.  Speeches like this make it harder for Clinton to maneuver.  If Democrats are supposed to be unrigging the system, it'll make it uncomfortable for Clinton to say things like ["lobbyists are people too"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaAkcXynqLA).  

The question is - could Warren just be honest and start attacking half the Democratic party as out of touch and beholden to Wall Street interests?  That would be the truth.  Why did Obama keep the roster of Rubinites and banker-apologists in power at Justice, the SEC and Treasury?   We already know that Warren dislikes them - she's been directly opposed to many of the policies they've instituted.  

There are essentially two choices: call out conservative Democrats and split the party in two, or attract a following and side line them.  Warren is clearly choosing the latter, and I think it's the right choice.  Nader, as much as I agree with him, took the first road, and look where that got him. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You know what, I think you are reading the graphic correctly and I was reading it incorrectly.  So, it's true that poor college grads end up in the top two quintiles 40% of the time, whereas rich drop outs end up in the top two quintiles 19% of the time.  

Why the hell did they include the left axis?  That is so damn confusing.

But as I said, this is a terrible comparison anyway.  The actual published charts tell the story much more clearly.  It's hard to argue with Figures [10](http://i.imgur.com/N8KCdUM.png) and [11](http://i.imgur.com/WUaCyEE.png).  

Poor drop outs are 3.4 times more likely to end up in the bottom quintile (Figure 10).  Meanwhile, poor college grads are just over half as likely to end up in the top quintile compared to rich college grads.  That doesn't sound like a meritocracy, does it?

	<TEXT> **EDIT** Realized I'm *totally* wrong about this.  See [my comment later in this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/comments/2josjx/poor_kids_who_do_everything_right_dont_do_better/cldtuef ).

- - - - - -
That commenter has simply misread the graphic. Specifically 19% of rich high school dropouts are not in the top **40%** (as claimed), rather *they are in the top* **20%**.  

On top of this, only 20% of poor college grads make it to the top 20%.  

I.e., *a rich high school dropout has as much of a chance of getting to the top 20% as a poor guy who slogged through college.*

Now, I'll grant that this is a pretty crappy chart, but it seems to have been cobbled together by WaPo.  For a more informative view of the data, take a look at [figures 10](http://i.imgur.com/N8KCdUM.png ) and [figure 11](http://i.imgur.com/WUaCyEE.png ) in [the original paper](http://www.bostonfed.org/inequality2014/papers/reeves-sawhill.pdf ).

Pretty clearly, being a rich goof is better than being a diligent poor.

	<TITLE> There needs to be a separate system of justice for the police </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-10-07 13:07:35 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> **EDIT** [madronedorf](http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueReddit/comments/2ijqtx/there_needs_to_be_a_separate_system_of_justice/cl2vauy ) points out I did a pretty crappy job with the title.  I should have written **"There needs to be a special prosecutor for police misconduct"**.

---
The outcome many expected - [no charges for anyone in the SWAT team that blew a hole in a baby with a flash bang](http://www.ajc.com/news/news/breaking-news/no-charges-for-officers-in-botched-drug-raid-that-/nhc2N/?__federated=1 ) - has come to pass.  I know many people are angry seeing cops commit horrific crimes and get away with no charges again and again.  Yet, though this issue is  finally starting to get coverage in the wider media, few speak about one of the most obvious causes of the problem.

Our current system requires that police are prosecuted by people who are essentially their colleagues.  Prosecutors rely on the testimony and cooperation of the police, so they have a strong motivation, if they want success and good relations with them in the future, to find reasons not to prosecute what are obviously crimes.  This   conflict of interest, has resulted in a lack of accountability which has allowed police culture to evolve in an increasingly violent direction.

Police brutality is a symptom of a structural problem.  Getting angry and demanding an end to bad police behavior, or demanding that police be prosecuted for one or another particularly horrendous beating, torture or murder won't solve the problem in the future.  We can't demand that the special relationship between prosecutors and police just magically go away.  It can't if they are to be effective at doing their jobs.  

The only solution, it seems, is to delegate independent prosecutors who are tasked solely with prosecuting police.  What do you think of this? Is there enough work for each state to have their own police prosecutor, or are there reasons for this function to be kept at the Federal level.  Who would this office report to to avoid political pressure being used to neuter the office?

I could not agree more.  I've totally lost respect for Ds who went silent on Obama after criticizing Bush on the exact same issues.  

 I agree, but i honestly think it's both sides

On issues of secrecy, surveillance and executive power, both sides are equally bad.  Obama is arguably worse on all of these issues, having expanded the Cheney doctrine (which the Neocons have gleefully complimented him on).  However, if we're talking about economic issues, the Democrats are very slightly better.    If we're talking about social issues, the Democrats win hands down.  If we're talking about the base, the Democrats have a feeble bunch of half-hearted partisans who are largely rational and have most of the very tiny number of rational unbiased voters, whereas the Republicans have a bunch of super passionate batshit-crazy partisans.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I know some like that too, and don't have a ton of sympathy for them.  But I think it's important to look at the big picture.  At the macro level  the middle class is working harder, longer hours, being more productive, and getting paid less.  George Bush said it well when [he complimented a woman on having 3 jobs]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIjo-dWE1Jg ).  "That is uniquely American, isn't it?"

Well, the truth is that it's the *modern* American condition, what we've been left with - two parents having to work just to make ends meet - while the tiny sliver at the top take all the societal gains.. Those few at the top with vast wealth, much of it inherited, can fail their way through life and still land on top because of the structure of modern capitalism.  Owning capital means you get rewarded with profit on work someone else did.  And our society is increasingly becoming one where it pays better to own than work.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you for that response. Could you elaborate on Krugman saying individuals ought not to own capital? I've never heard that from him... honestly, that would surprise me a bit.

I read the Murphy piece, but I'm a bit skeptical.  He seems to be driving at his conclusions because he's upset at Piketty's conclusions, not because of analysis.  Giles, on the other hand, certainly seemed to have an analysis.  I thought his conclusions were pretty damning when they came out, but they have since been pretty thoroughly and humiliatingly debunked (even by the very authors he quoted).  The other main criticism is that Piketty got depreciation rates wrong, but Delong deals with that issue [here](http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2014/06/over-at-equitable-growth-depreciation-rates-on-wealth-in-thomas-pikettys-database-monday-focus-june-9-2014.html ). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> While I agree with you on the micro-scale, at the macro scale we're facing  an economy of increasing automation, which is obviating the need for jobs.  CPG Grey made a good video that explains: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pq-S557XQU.  The only people that stand to win in such an economy are the ones who own the robots, so to speak.  We're seeing the beginnings of this transition today.  

As labor becomes unnecessary, the bargaining power of workers falls.  People aren't lazier than they were before -- they're more productive, work longer hours, have poorer health, and less free time -- but they get paid less.  The richest family in America can pay workers so little they have to rely on government assistance to get by, at the same time their company makes vast profits.  Such is the benefit of inherited wealth.

In the world we're moving into, those  who own the means of production and distribution have increasingly greater bargaining power and extract more value from labor contracts.  Workers work harder, produce goods more efficiently, and because of their efficiency put themselves out of jobs, and because of their weaker bargaining power,  share in less and less of the wealth.  

This mirrors the finding of Piketty et al., who I'm sure you've heard of if you are hanging out on Reddit frequently.  His work conclusively demonstrates that in aggregate, and increasingly so, you become wealthier simply by owning capital, whereas on average you become poorer if your income derives primarily from doing work.

	<TEXT> Yet, SCOTUS ruled that the government also has an interest in safeguarding the integrity of the electoral process.  The Constitution has conflicting goals which need to be balanced with one another.  The purpose of these amendments is to preserve a government by and of the people.   Yet, as we know from the recent Princeton study, the US is now effectively an oligarchy. 

So some balance is needed.  It won't come from the Supreme Court, which is the most corporate-friendly in history, which has overturned precedent and rejected the laws which our *elected representatives* have passed.  Their actions have made a new amendment necessary.

	<TEXT> That code was a joke, but, having worked on several different reasoning systems, I don't see how any of them could ever be considered conscious.   

 No not at all, considering we are a few pounds of soft grey spongy material. 

But it's not clear what kind of physics is going on in there.  (And no, I don't believe in Hameroff's microtubule nonsense).  

What is clear, however, is that any of the most sophisticated AI reasoners that you could run on the fastest digital computer around today could also run on this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40DkJ9vt5CI (Please watch) - where the physics is clear, and obviously doesn't invoke consciousness.  To say that thing is conscious just doesn't pass the giggle test.

    def do_experiment():
        print("Please stop experimenting on me.")

     do_experiment()
    Please stop experimenting on me.


The question revolves around whether it is possible to hurt an AI and whether AIs have any subjective sensation.  I think we can agree that in the above case it doesn't.  So the real question is, when does an AI experience anything?  

The things that we call computers today are Turing equivalent.  That is, any one device could simulate any other Turing-equivalent device.  That means that [a machine like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40DkJ9vt5CI) could, given enough time (and tape), run any fancy AI program we dream up.  I think it strains credibility to think such a machine could ever be conscious, or that we should ever care about its suffering.  Don't you agree?

	<TEXT> The machine's states are governed by the positions of the white flaps that are attached to a bar at the top of the machine.  Call this the "state bar".  Balls collected from the front are dropped onto the state bar.  If the bar drops onto a state flap, it rotates the bar, effectively changing the state.

Notice that the ball is picked up from one of 5 positions in front of the machine.  Each of these positions represents a Symbol; call them B1...B5.  When a ball is picked up from position ***i***, it is dropped onto the state flap in position ***i***.  Depending on the position of the state bar, the flap at position ***i*** may be in the way.  If the bar has 2 rotational positions, then the machine has 2 states, which we'll call S1 and S2. 

Thus, the rules are encoded by positioning flaps at positions 1,2,3,4,5 (corresponding to symbols B1...B5).

E.g.,

| states/positions | 1 | 2  |  3 |  4 |  5 |
| ----------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---: |
|  S1  | 0 | 1  |  0 |  1 |  0 |
|  S2  | 1 | 0  |  1 |  0 |  1 |

In this rule system, B2 and B4 cause S1-S2 transition whereas B1,B3 and B5 cause S2-S1.

This is just an example of how to write  rules.   (I'm not making any claims about whether this is Turing complete.)

	<TEXT> There is no agency. A computer is a simple mechanism, and can be implemented using very different components:

  * electronic (the kind you're using now)
  * [mechanical](http://hackaday.com/2011/03/25/mechanical-turing-machine-can-compute-anything-slowly/ )
  * [water and valves](http://www.inquisition.ca/en/info/artic/ordineau.htm )
  
When arranged in the right way, such parts can "compute" when a motor is run.  In the case of electronic computers, the motor is an electronic clock which causes the computer to advance from one step of a computation to another.  For a mechanical computer, a real motor does the job.  

In fact, it doesn't matter what the parts are -- computers are said to be "equivalent" to each other --- i.e., any program you can describe in the most sophisticated modern electronic computer could be run (albeit slowly) on a mechanical or water-valve-based computer.  

Think of a computer as a player piano which interprets a line of the piano roll differently depending on what keys are currently pressed, and which is capable of modifying the roll (adding or deleting holes) and moving it back and forth.  The only thing that is required is an external source of energy to drive it through its paces.  As I said above, in a modern computer, an electronic clock plays this role of stepping transistors through their paces, but the principle is the same.

The mathematician Alan Turing described the first general purpose computer, and that machine was capable of doing all of the computations of any modern day computer. Checkout the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40DkJ9vt5CI#t=13 ) in the "mechanical" link above.  Just pause and soak that in for a moment - that primitive device (given enough tape) is capable of doing any computation your fancy 2014 laptop is.

For that reason we call general purpose computers "Turing-complete".  They are all equivalent to each other in terms of the computations they can do. The only difference is that modern ones are smaller and faster, and have better input-output capabilities.  But  from a mathematical perspective, Turing's original "a-machine" was just as powerful.  In fact, the Turing machine in the video is capable of *simulating* the CPU in your laptop.  Pretty mind-blowing, huh?

Turing's machine was based on a pretty simple mechanism which had 6 states and wrote 2 symbols.  Yet, [even simpler mechanisms](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfram%27s_2-state_3-symbol_Turing_machine ) have been described.  So Turing completeness is pretty easy to create.  People have even created Turing-complete computers inside virtual worlds [like Minecraft](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X21HQphy6I ).   Given enough memory and time, they're just as capable as the most powerful super computer available today.

So how to computers appear to think and have agency?  All the magic happens in programs. Programs cause computing machines  to move from state to state and read and write symbols as it does so.  We interpret the output as the results of the computation.  

I highly recommend Martin Davis's  excellent book on the origins of computing called ["The Universal Computer"](http://www.amazon.com/The-Universal-Computer-Leibniz-Turing/dp/0393047857 ) for a great explanation of how questions about the foundations of mathematics gave rise to modern computing.
