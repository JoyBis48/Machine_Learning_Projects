	<TEXT> i've been applying for a few jobs lately and found that a lot but not all redirect to their own website and ask you to fill out forms which ask for the same details which are on your resume

why do some places do this? example is they ask for previous employment history and references yet they would be in the resume

edit- forget to add they also ask you to upload a  resume </TEXT>

i honestly think he has the better chance of being a future world champion and would be a waste of good talent if he isn't picked up by one of the bigger teams </TEXT>

	<TEXT> honestly i think Ricciardo gets a little more credit then he deserves due to last year.. his wins came from safety cars and when Mercedes had issues

what i want to see is him get a good car for a few years and see if he can consistently pull off results like 2014 or if it was just a one off

right now the red bull is a turd so you can't count this year to be fair to him </TEXT>
