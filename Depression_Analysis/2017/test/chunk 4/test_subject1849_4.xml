	<TEXT> Designated Hitter in the National League or Having only a 8 man lineup is the easiest solution. Also, it would uniform the whole league in its rules. 

You could also wait decades to fix the low offense game, but every sport has made changes to its rules since its inception. Baseball rules have been altered throughout history. The game of the 1890s and 1920s is different from today's. What is interesting is that we had more offense and shorter games decades ago. 

There are other methods that would be more drastic:

Changing the Baseball's Matter, Alter the Bat's matter, Bring the Fences in, Treat all Fouls as nothing against the batter, Lower the Pitcher's Mound,

	<TEXT> It isn't Post-Hoc Fallacy. This logic would also apply to debunk any Tax Cuts boosting jobs, Reagan's deflation/taxcuts boosting the economy, Republicans claiming Bush's economic growth is better than Clinton's because he got us out of the Tech-Bubble, Stimulus creating jobs, any government cuts/spending creating jobs, etc.

Anything in the Marco-Level economics can happen, so justifying Post-Hoc is really missing the whole point of economics. It is all about correlation and sometimes causation, but it also up for the intrepretation of stats.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Agreed, but there is a vocal wealthy minority that opposes this more proportional system ever since James Madison's Federalist Papers, which warned about a pure democracy voting away rights of white property owners. Honestly, I have yet to see a proportional democracies in developed voting away rights of "minorities" left and right without a legal system.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A better solution is getting rid of the 2 party system, not proportional and sometimes anti-majority electoral college, gerrymandered house districts, and corrupt Senate. We need more parties and more proportion when we are voting. We are always one party away from a one party nation. In fact, many states are already almost one party controlled. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We should be focusing on a proportional multiparty system with majority governs or coalition forming than mandatory voting.
