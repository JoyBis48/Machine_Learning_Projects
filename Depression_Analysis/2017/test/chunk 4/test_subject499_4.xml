	<TEXT> Things didn't turn out as planned.

That's an understatement.

It makes me feel sick to the stomach,

and I can only just see it from your point.

But see it from mine!

If you were in love with someone else

You wouldn't give me a second though,

Wouldn't think to care how I feel...

But it was me you loved, me

You left someone else for.

I could call you a fool,

Say it was your fault,

That you shoulder the blame.

*

But Ive always been a realist:

This is my burden, and my fault.

Fuck the lessons, we dont want to be kids anymore.

But thats out of our hands, and so that's what we are: kids.

Prone to mistakes, slaves to feelings.

Greedy, malicious.



I should have seen this from the beginning.

Should have known how it would turn out.

Should have predicted the tears.

But I couldn't care for your heart,

because I don't have mine:

When you're in love that's what you give away.

*

I won't make excuses, you deserve more than my childish 
cowardice,

Trying to worm my way out of it, with no where to run.

I told you what I was like, you chose not to believe me.

Unintentionally I taught you the hard way what I was truly like.

And now I've lost myself trying to see myself for what I truly am.

Nothing, nothing.

That's what you would have seen me as.

*

I meant every kiss  if it's any condolence,

If you can believe, for even a second, anything that comes from 
my mouth,

Kiss or words. But I'll leave it up to you to decipher true from 
false.

Though I deserve nothing but your hatred.

And if it means anything, yes, shivers swept down my spine the 
first time we kissed,

And I enjoyed the moments that we shared.

But I couldn't keep it up,

Because somehow she got back into my head,

into my heart.

And I want you to know if I could have chosen, 

I would have thought things through, and, for now, I would have 
picked you.

*

I want to end this poem saying

I'm in love,

but not with you.

And it doesnt matter, as hard as you wish,

It's not you, and it never was.

I always loved her, I always will.

Neither of us will get what we want, 

thats the way it's going to be.

And, Oh, how I have

dreamt.    



And the rage, and the passion, and the

Heat, and tongues of that fire

Had licked my conscious desire;

And I knew that in that one, tiny

Infinitesimal, minute moment

I could be more than this.

And yet.

And yet.

Oh, but still

That it were possible to be all 

My dreams

Have foreseen.

And not this, 

Hollow,

Impassioned being

Of caged-fire

And dewy eyed 

Desire.

	<TEXT> So, we are meeting again.
You. You who still haunt my

Every waking hour

To you I am to blame

For this shell I call home.

For whom I blame for this neglect, destitution.  



I am a man.

I am a boy.

I am a human.

I am everything you

Should have known

You would leave me as.

You who are so bitter,

So spiteful. You who would

Break skin for the malevolence,

For the colour: blood.

And unto me you left this

Learners scar, 

So you could be a poet.  



I am a poet,

You are a fool,

You are a child, you are

The neglectful little 

malignance that is the 

abode of my every whim.

You are the little malicious 

Greed that left me to thirst

As you fed this fire.

This pen wouldnt fit so 

Perfectly

In my teeth if you hadnt

Shown me how to hold it.  



You are not a man,

You are not a boy,

You do not consider yourself human.

You are an object,

Arent you?

And how I hate you,

I hate

I do not hate those scars

On your arm,

Not so much as

Your fathers disappointment,

But a lesson you taught

Yourself

Well.

How alive we are.

Just you and me.

I am the form you wish you had,

But having said that

There will be more poems

To come.

	<TEXT> Love the poem, excellent imagery.

But I feel it would benefit from punctuation. That is really my own opinion, and discard if you wish. But for me the poem is slow, it's thought out, and it reads meticulously, it rewards the slow reader. But without punctuation there's no pace, or style, it's just one solid read through. No chance to break, and consider, or think about what's been wrote.

Just my two cents. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Interesting start to the poem. I love it! :D

Feedback: I get that you're repeating yourself, reinforcing that the recipient is a 'cunt'. But the repetitions doesn't read well with only a comma. Try placing a full stop there. It rounds off the first 'cunt', and reads easier for the second one. Equally keep the comma, and remove the second 'you're', but I think it reads better with a full stop, as it is.

Third line: That rhyme, it's distracting, because it's the first rhyme in the poem (pretty much the only one). It feels a touch forced, and very much out of place. I get what you're trying to say, and, this is my own personal input, I didn't like it, it felt wrong. Perhaps try rewording it, find another word for defeat?

Fourth line: Touch of interpretation here. Does the person come back shrouded in' love you never going to know?'. Or is it a separate line, a second taunt. Might need breaking up, or the meaning you want (conjoined, separate) made clearer. Love the line after that.

A lot of comma's in the sentence after that. Which reads fine, it's not a fast poem. It's mostly when it comes out of 'year' into 'sitting contempt'. The whole line might need tweaking, it reads fine without any comma's between weeks, months, year, but I see what you're going for with all of those comma's. Here's an idea, try separating the list with dashes;

 and share in the revelry, but tonight - as in the past weeks, and months, and year - I sit in contempt of love lost...

Reads a touch smoother, but doesn't detract. Even if you don't take on board that idea, I think there's still something there that needs doing.

Great poem. Perfectly angsty, eye-catching beginning, and it doesn't wane for a second. Excellent final line, really homes in what the entire poem is about, and makes it count; a perfect ending. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A poem about night terrors? Most awesome! Wonderfully captured, I might add. 

Start: amazing, the alliteration really draws you in, rolls off the tongue, easy to read. Perfect. (Missed capital on 'Your'). 

Not sure what that dash is for between 'you are sure - has been bestowed'. I found it kinda distracting. It reads fine without it, and I don't feel the need for it in the least. 

That first sentence, second stanza, is pretty long, a real mouthful. Perhaps put a full-stop after 'bestowed' and remove the 'as'.

has been bestowed. You resiliently calculate the servitude of the coming episode.

Works really with the 2nd person theme, as well.

At the end of the second stanza you switch from past to present tense in the last section;

where an ugly face it showed, an even uglier grin it bares. 

This is fine if you want to say that in the nightmare it showed an ugly face, but awake an 'uglier grin it bares'. However as it reads it feels like the same, descriptive sentence, that switches tense.

Air capture? Interesting phrase. Respiration, perhaps? 

This section: *'each of your ex and inhales'*. I read 'ex' as something different, and got confused, I had to go back and then I realised you meant exhale and inhale. Easy solution, bring them together: *'ex-and-inhales'*. Makes it read faster too, which keeps up the pace, and makes it more obvious that floaty 'ex' is joined.

Third stanza: you've got a comma, a single word, and a semi-colon and I can't quite get my head around you want it to be read. The comma speeds up the pace, it could easily be a full-stop but isn't, so; read faster. But the semi-colon immediately slows it right down. Read through that sentence, get a feel for the pace, and what each punctuation does to the line, and reel it in. 

I would recommend a full stop between 'each thumb' and 'as the fear sets in'. It rounds out that last sentence, makes the 'knows it's nearly won' much more significant as it stands on it's own. It's also a long sentence that would benefit from the break. 

Fourth stanza. It wasn't until this point I realised it was about night terrors. Which is nice, because the first portion is entirely me wondering what is happening, and then suddenly realising. The poem is *absolutely* fine as it is, but consider what it would do to the poem if you made it more obvious what it was about from the get-go.

Your third sentence reads like running water *and then* you hit that darned semi-colon before vile. You don't need it, it reads fine without it, it reads better, in fact. It really just brings this whole, wonderful beat you've got going in that sentence to a jarring halt, when it could continue until the sentence ends. Without that semi-colon, that is my favourite sentence in the whole poem. 

Excellent, spine-chilling end to the poem, the rest is perfect.

You know I really liked this piece, it's actually superbly well written, and you've such a finger on the pace, it's controlled ever so tightly, you just let it slip sometimes. The word choice is great, I love it.


(It's possible you didn't intend it to be about night terrors, that's just my interpretation. You can correct me if I'm wrong. The critique stands, except that one bit about introducing the night-terrors sooner, it's all good) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hello. My feeling is that you wanted *judging* to stand out more on it's own, so consider putting a full-stop after expressionless. It breaks judging off, and brings it more into it's own which I think is what you're heading for. It reads the same, just with a bigger pause.

I just want to bring attention to these two lines:

Swallowed by the sea of masqurade masks,

But yours broke long ago.


The first sentence is alliterative in two cases (swallow, sea. Masquerade, masks). And the sentence is smooth, and flows. But then it completely changes pace when you get to the next sentence and suddenly *'but'*. I think with the alliteration you can get away with the hard sylablles, (especially the 'sk' on 'mask'), but that is ruined with the, short, heavy 'but'. Perhaps change it to 'though';

though yours broke long ago.

Reads a bit smoother, coming from the alliterative previous sentence. I understand 'though' might change the story a tad - though the meaning is just as implicit. So if you don't go with 'though' I do recommend tweaking it a touch to something that leads off of the first sentence a bit smoother.

The rest of the poem is pretty darn great. I would say *perhaps* a semi-colon after 'smoulder', but I'm not sure if I'm reading that right, so it's entirely up to you.

Rest is awesome :)

P.S misspelled masquerade as masqurade (I'm sure it's just a typo, though). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, I really liked this. Read it a few times and I like the story, it's different and unique and well written.

Not sure if it's a reddit thing but having it written like this it messes with the rhymes, which is fine - the rhymes come through - but it messes with the beat of the piece as well. Which, for a rhyming poem, you don't want. So consider playing around with the structure, seeing what works, what you like, and what suits the beat and those rhymes best.

Also, that comma after the semi-colon on the first line:

 No reason is there to fear, What we see and what we hear.

It works better without the comma. But then you've capitalised the W in what, so I'm not sure what you're trying to say. 

Otherwise, excellent =]

	<TEXT> Aaww ah, man. Back in the day Runescape was *the shit*. I think I've played that game more than any other game - count it in months not hours or days.

If you liked Skyrim - you'll like The Witcher. Shadow of Mordor was a brilliant game, but not absolutely similar to other open-world-high-fantasy-rpg's like Skyrim or Dragon Age. 

If you want to start on *decent* fantasy - you can't do better than The Witcher. In fact you've played Skyrim, easily 2nd best. Now all you need to play is Fable Anniversary and you've hit the trifecta. (Though DA1 is always worth a play through). 

If you haven't played a lot of MMORPG's, you might like TESO, I don't know. It depends what else you've played. If you haven't a lot of MMO's - like I have - you might really like it. When you play almost all of them, they all bleed into one. I'm just waiting for the next big one that *does something different!*

Being objective there was nothing particularly wrong with TESO. It ticked the right boxes, and it was a really nice feeling to be back in Morrowind.* Just that it was generic and samey as every other one. TLOTRO and WoW included. Atlantica had a different feel to it, and different combat. FLYFF is one of the most gorgeous MMO's out there, and the aesthetic makes it feel vibrant enough you can slightly overlook that it the gameplay is the same as every other game. Aion does a lot of things well, but at it's core is the same as every other MMO. The only two I haven't played but really want to is Wildstar, but, above all, Guild Wars 2. But I ain't paying for that when I expect I won't like it.

*Morrowind is the third installment into the TES game, and is better than Oblivion, and only marginally not-as-good as Skyrim. It's starting to show it's age (has done for years) but it's one of the most vibrant and alive worlds for a game you can imagine. It's TES so the story is good, and it plays the same as Skyrim, but without the dragons. To offset the dragons the explorability of Morrowind is top-notch. This is mostly helped by the fact it isn't based on medieval England, which most every fantasy game is (and even The Witcher is guilty of). Honestly if you want a superb fantasy game outside of the limits of medieval-england-fantasy, look no farther than Morrowind. 

P.S This whole message is based on *fantasy* RPG's. Sci-fi, and otherkinds, aren't so much my expertise. </TEXT>

Ok.

You honestly want to compare that generic, tripe, pieceofshit "game", that really is just fodder for your HDD to waste. To what is, hands down, one of *the best* **games**, *not just open-world, or rpg,* **game**.

Get. The. Witcher.

Also, don't consider TESO. Really not a good MMORPG. The best MMORPG I've ever played (and I've played pretty much every one) is Atlantica. Also FLYFF.  Aion is a good shout, but there isn't much too it to separate it. Same for Rift. Wildstar looks like it might be good (one of the few I haven't played) and it's going f2p soon, so worth checking out once that happens.

Let me just enamour the Witcher 3 some more. Name an open-world game. It's better than it. Fantasy RPG's? It's the best. Over Dragon-Age and (dare I say it) Skyrim. You've been waiting for proof the new gen is worth investing in: VOILA! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Are we talking Neopets as in...that bright website where you look after a Neopet, and battle it and minigames and such?

Because if we are, man I used to love the shit out of that game! Played it for years. It was the best. It quickly got pushed out by Runescape. That's how long ago this was. Over ten years haha. I thought Neopets was dead, tbh. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would say Word but I'm poor so Open Office. Does the job. I've tried programs built specifically for writing and they're always a pain in the ass. So many things just get in the damn way. I'm sure I had one, and I couldn't start writing until I had written, a title, and chapter-title, and characters and all of this anal BS and I couldn't find how to (or it wouldn't let me) just write.

Nothing wrong with Word. Absolutely great. Does the job, does it simply, does it well. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I know sure if that's the right word for it. But I also feel quite inferior to people. Recently my friend got a 1st in his Uni degree. I only got a second. I hide behind this viciously by saying I never tried and put all the effort into my novel, instead. I put him down by saying "well I was smarter than you in High School" which I know damn well ain't true.

So like I said I don't know if it's an inferiority complex. But whenever I feel...inferior, I lash out like an asshole and try and put myself above him, if not about the same thing (say, academically) then about something else. And I don't like being an asshole.

And yes, it makes me super competitive, and sometimes a sore loser - but I know when I'm going to be beat, and I don't mind if I foresee it. Usually it makes me just not want to compete.

Inferiority complex? Or asshole-ism?   </TEXT>

Yeah, sorry about the minecraft thing. I think once it gets into it it will separate from MC quite drastically. By the looks of it it's much more of a "town-sim" to MC's "build-for-the-shits-and-giggles." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> *Stoner, by John Williams*. One of the best books ever written. And the most in-depth look, the most human showcase in any book I've ever found. It essentially follows the life of one man, William Stoner, from birth to death. Truly an amazing book. But it does take place mostly early to mid 1900's, so it's not a contemporary setting, if that detracts anything for you.

I also recommend the hard-back edition with the grey cover. Not only does it look nicer, it's also the best binding *ever*. And how many books can claim that accolade?

Also, though to a lesser extend. *Humans, by Matt Haig*. It's about an alien who inhabits a human body and has to come to terms with what it means to be human. It's not a heavy book, and makes for a pretty light read. It has its moments, but it's not quite an in-depth look at the "human experience" as you might want. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I didn't like AC1 to be honest. Far too repetitive. But AC2 was amazing. And I liked Brotherhood, and Revelations. Ac3 was a colossal disappointment, which I didn't even finish, because it wasted the first few hours of my gameplay as *not even the main character*.
(It also skips over how hundreds of years of generations are Assassins but then suddenly, *templar!*,).
Black Flag was simply great. And they really fucked up with Unity. Not just because it was shit, but because they took out the core mechanic that made Black Flag amazing.

But I am interested in the new one. I've been saying they should set one in London since AC2, so I'm pretty interested to play a title set in my own home. Having said that, will definitely be checking reviews before I get it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I wrote my whole novel this way. Just had loose ideas of where it was heading, but in general the entire novel happened organically. 

It took me longer to write than it should have. I think that's how you pay. What took me the longest to write wasn't the writing, it was trying to figure out which direction to take it in.

My new novel I sat down, spent two months planning it out, making everything fit, so it worked and I had a decent plan I could follow. I haven't sunk my teeth into that project yet but now I know it won't take me as long. There are scenes that are harder to write, some I don't want to write. And that was true in my first novel, so I didn't write them, I put it off. Now I have a plan I know exactly what is going to happen in that scene, I've come to terms with it, so I can just get down to it. 

I don't want to say planning is the best way to go until I've finished my current novel. But having worked on a novel that I wrote organically, I wouldn't support it wholeheartedly.  </TEXT>
