	<TEXT> Why do you get $30? For doing what? And you have your own car too? wtf?

When I was 15 I was legal to get a part-time job; I've never been unemployed longer than a month or two (thankfully) since. Before that I worked my ass off shoveling snow and mowing lawns in the neighbourhood to buy a pack of skittles or something small.

Wtf, $30 for doing zilch. I don't understand it </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When my 970 FTW really works hard I do get a bit of coil whine but its unnoticeable when game audio gets loud (or wearing headphones).

Performance wise, I get 50-60FPS maxed at 1440p in the most demanding games. Crysis 3 at max, MSAAx2, gives me about 45FPS and that is easily the most demanding game on market. The only game that is killing me is Dragon Age Inquisition @ 35-50FPS on *high* (not max). Can you say *unoptimized console port?*

If I knew about the coil whine before, I would have bought another card and down the "FTW" overclock myself. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Wow very solid build man. Ask for a 1440p monitor for Christmas, $300 from Korea (ebay) :) Do you have a disc drive to install Windows?

 Do i need a cpu cooler (other than stock)?

Only if you plan on overclocking your CPU (which the 4690 can do in spades). I have the same cooler as you - let's me get up to 4.5GHz on my i5.
 Do i need thermal paste?

Yes. They're dirt cheap and necessary

 minus an anti-static wrist band, anything else i need to fully build a pc?

Get an old credit card for the thermal paste. If you have a friend with a nice toolbox, ask to borrow it (or get your friend to help build!). </TEXT>

Far cry 4, dragon age 1/2/3, etc. All look the same 60 or 120 (I lower settings as I see fit to get them to run up to 120).

Strange thing is the testing website gives me 120Hz and games say the same thing. Windows says 120Hz. Nvidia says 120Hz. Even FRAPS and Shadowplay say 61+ FPS yet I cannot see a visual difference for the life of me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You get the same kind of goodies with other pre-orders; how is this any different? 

 Even if there's problems at release, they will be promptly fixed and all new content for the game will be free.

But how do you *know* this? Every developer has claimed the same, yet time and time again this is not always the case. 

Watch this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mf5Uj4XIT1Y

What is with this attachment people having to developers? You don't know them. You don't work with them or for them. You pay them money for a product when it *releases.* Pre-ordering is so incredibly fucking pointless for digital products, it boggles the mind why someone except the most rabid of fanboy would go through with it.

I don't fucking care if Witcher 1 and 2 were great (they were). You don't work for CDProjekt Red. They could have entirely new management for all we know and completely fuck up Witcher 3. You don't know. All you have is this blind, unfounded faith in a group of Polish game developers. It makes no fucking sense. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Wow that CPU is way overpowered for your GPU. 

Get this one: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16819116942nm_mc=AFC-C8Junctioncm_mmc=AFC-C8Junction-_-na-_-na-_-nacm_sp=AID=10446076PID=3938566SID=

With the $50 you save, upgrade your GPU to a 760 instead. http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814127744cm_re=gtx_760-_-14-127-744-_-Product

Otherwise it is a fine build. Sexy case </TEXT>

And 500W is fine if you're not using 2 cards. </TEXT>

TLDR: not really. 1TB one has better warranty, longer life span, and better random speeds (but that is very minor at this stage). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am a game dev too, so I have 16GB in my desktop. I started with 8, and like I said, waited for RAM go on sale - which it often does. I'd suggest using the extra money to get the 290X now if you find a good price, then wait for RAM to get marked down in a few weeks for Boxing Day.

For Maya, Adobe CS, etc. 8GB is enough unless you're doing super heavy-duty stuff (like an extremely hi-res model of a Star Citizen-esque spaceship).

Unless if you need the RAM now, the 290 is still a great card.

Do you have peripherals already? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hard drive? SSD? Will need somewhere to store Windows + games.

And unless you really need 16GB ram (which is usually overkill), get 8GB for $50 less and use that money towards and 290X instead.

If you need 16GB, wait for Boxing Day when that kind of stuff (RAM, hard drives, small stuff) goes down 50% off. </TEXT>
