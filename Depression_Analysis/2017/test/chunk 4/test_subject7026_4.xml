	<TEXT> I don't think that's a very good comparison, the issue the guy is having is that if Geel were to bet 3% of every pot he would receive 3% back because there's a 3% cut going to the site. If he puts in nothing he still gains 3% of the pot, if he puts in 3% and wins he gets it all, if he puts in 3% and loses he gets back the same value that he put in.  
  
The problem with your car example is that the salesman would not be gaining extra. I don't see a huge issue with what Geel is doing but I can see why others would. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's actually a funny story, I told some of my friends that I paypal scammed someone out of a Sulphorus Killer Exclusive because I felt like it would be something cool to discuss for a few days. So I choose some high tier yet slightly believable hats and told them I sold the KE to buy these.  
The reason I thought of doing this was because I had a 24 hour ban on backpack.tf for a price suggestion to make the Stout Shako 2 refined. Only one person knew that was the reason I was banned, it was pretty entertaining.  
  
I didn't actually paypal scam anyone and I never will, mostly because I don't have a paypal. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you aren't sure how it works, here's basically how to use it!  
  
Type in some things you want to spam with the press of a button, for example  
  
what button sprints guys?  
how to fly as demonstration man?  
how to be boom boom king?  
where get burny bison hat?  
  
Then when you're finished with them, press "Clear the Server"  
You will get a huge wall of text, copy that and paste it into a notepad and [save it as] (http://i.imgur.com/ye6xGVv.png) "Trash.cfg", you will now want to be sure to save it as [all files] (http://i.imgur.com/tUrYe9g.png)  
  
Locate your ["cfg"] (http://i.imgur.com/3msMFLg.png) folder in your tf folder, look for literally any mod guide and you *should* get directions on how to get here, assuming you did it correctly you should be able to go into tf2 and type "exec trash" in the console, alternatively you could probably use autoexec or something but I'm not some turbonerd who knows how to use that.  
  
When you get into a server press the "P" key to say a random line from what you wrote!  
Enjoy getting votekicked! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It isn't really true like this though, Sniper can right click then left click for an instant 150 damage, killing most classes in one hit. Scout's speed is countered by the Engineer, Medic isn't the only class that can heal, you are correct in saying it is the easiest but Engineer and Heavy can do it too. There's also health kits but whatever. Being fast means nothing when you're facing a good Sniper. Healing isn't possible when you've been killed by a good sniper. Even a Heavy isn't safe if the sniper can hold his horses for a minute. </TEXT>
