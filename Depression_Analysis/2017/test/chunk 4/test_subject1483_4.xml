	<TEXT> Ok, I admit when I'm wrong. You can build a PC for the same price as a console. But let's be honest here, who would actually want to play with it? Who would not fork out the extra cash to upgrade a few components? And there lies the problem with PC gaming, it is a never ending hole which you keep chucking your money into. I buy my console once, and for the entirety of that consoles life I will be able to play all the games they release for it, you won't. At some point a game will be released where you need certain amount of RAM or w/e and you will have to buy it on top of the game you are buying it for. I just don't see it worth the time and money just to play with better graphics and mods. </TEXT>

Yes you could build a gaming PC on the cheap but you will be on the lower end of performance and will eventually end up buying more and more components to upgrade your PC to handle the next game that comes out. Where as a console will run any game for the reminder of it's life. </TEXT>

Every fucking chance they get they are glued to their fucking screens playing some new and normally retarded game in which all you do is tap or swipe, currently it's MK X. The reason I hate it so much is because it is non-stop, literally any second they have they will be on their phones ignoring every one around them. The worst part is when we are in my house playing xbox, when it's not their turn to play instead of watching the others play and provide some conversation they will bring out their fucking phones to play those stupid fucking games whilst waiting to play another game. It's fucking sickening and I'm really raging against mobile games atm so much that a lot of what I've said doesn't even makes sense. **RAGEEEEEEE** I wish I could punch the creator of candy saga in the face, that bitch/bastard started it all. </TEXT>

What I suggest you do is read the little booklet that comes with the game. It gives you some decent backstory. The only problem I've encountered so far is a part of dialogue which I had to recall what I did in certain events in the prior games, I just winged it. </TEXT>
