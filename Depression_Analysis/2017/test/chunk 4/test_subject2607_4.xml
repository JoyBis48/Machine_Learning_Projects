They'll act devastated and like it's the end of the world, but then just forget about me. And it's really ruining my self esteem, you know? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm getting a haircut in a couple hours, and I am going to have to get it short due to really burned hair in the back of my head, and I'll probably need it thinned out a bit. I kind of want shorter hair anyway because right now I'm getting bored with my plain haircut. I need to hear suggestions from you guys because I don't know how short or in what style or color I want. It will be difficult to decide because I have a round face which tends to not look super great with short hair. Here's a picture for reference: imgur.com/lLiTVM9 </TEXT>

He passed away two years ago right when I turned 13. So I don't know. I'd be nervous to talk to my psychiatrist about it because I don't want to sound like one of those melodramatic teenage girls that think they have bipolar disorder, even though they're just hormones. </TEXT>
