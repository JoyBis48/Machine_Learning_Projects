	<DATE> 2015-01-18 04:02:13 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I was playing cevo about 30 mins ago, I was playing alright and my team wasn't horrible and we got a lot of rounds on T side Nuke, so I had no incentive to leave but because my ping randomly kept fluctuating past 160 for some reason I got "kicked" and couldn't join back because my ping was staying way to high (most likely internet problems or something). So I waited it out and it was back to normal, joined a game until it started and then I got kicked because I was on a cool down because I apparently left the game? But I didn't, I got kicked because my ping kept fluctuating to quite literally 161-65... Just a minor complaint but I think it shouldn't be like that because sometimes you can't really control what your shitty internet does.

Was only banned for 30 mins so it's not too bad... [screenshot](http://gyazo.com/dc48505e62cd889e7e6e6b74255d010c) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have D so I'm not sure about C but the only thing that helps me is basically mild/moderate opiates, if I don't have them then I'm fucked mainly because if I don't I'll either be out at school and have to run home while trying not to shit myself, which is harder than it seems. 

I actually like being constipated (that's what opiates do to your GI tract) but it's probably A LOT different than the constipation from IBS-C.

I also get extreme stomach pains from time to time (they don't happen that often) that will literally floor me and make me scream in pain, even if I'm out in public.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They still need improvements, some of the meds will literally knock you out for what feels like forever and make you gain a lot of weight that you previously wouldn't have put on. They can also make you feel like an emotionless zombie (but that CAN be due to the schizophrenia, but the meds also do that to you). So they do need to work them out a bit, and I've read recently that schizophrenia is most likely 8 different genetically distinct diseases, so maybe if that's true that'll open the gate for better medication.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I was at a psychiatric appointment earlier in the week (Tuesday) and I was basically describing OCD-like "symptoms" if you will, it's basically having to check things constantly until I know it's the way it is and ask someone certain things (not gonna go into detail about it) until I believe them, it's kinda like paranoia but more anxiety driven. I get a lot of intrusive thoughts, pretty much every day actually. I used to go for a shower about 6-7 times a day as a kid, but that died down a lot as I got older, and now it's completely opposite. Has anyone here ever noticed anything like this before? In the past or maybe right now or whatever? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Codeine varies between person to person because it's a pro drug. Some people lack a certain enzyme and don't get anything out of it, not even pain relief because their bodies can't properly process it into morphine (or not at all). Anyway, I would dose about 120-180mg (I would really start with around 120-128 though. 

DPH would help with nausea and it will also make the effects stronger (I personally used to like promethazine though, if you can get that). 

Have fun and don't make a habit out of it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I personally think all drugs that have been highly researched (most opiates, most stimulants, weed, definitely MOST psychedelics etc) should be fully legal but of course regulated, kinda like alcohol. Except with drugs like opiates and stimulants you can only buy a certain amount every 2 days. 

Alcohol killed people and made them blind when it was illegal back in the 1900s, alcohol STILL kills people but not to the same extent. The reason heroin and the like kill people is because its prohibited. Imagine if heroin was legal, you would know the correct purity at all times, you would have clean needles (so the infection rate of HIV will plummet), there will be MUCH less crime because there will be no need for a black market for these drugs, there will be much less people in prison and there will be a lot more and better rehab/treatment facilities  around. The "war on drugs" is a massive joke and shouldn't still be around, god damn its been about 50 years. COME ON.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, it usually does. But for me it's as if it's there, but not really, if you get me? That's why I said it's a mix of outside voices and inner voices, it's a weird thing. I've also had inner monologue being corrupted by some jackasses, dunno what that's about though. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Who knows? No one seems to really know. Ask your doctor why your meds "work" or don't work, they have no clue... Why is psychiatry so behind when psychiatric illnesses can literally disable you as badly as not being able to walk?

	<TEXT> Basically, I don't fully understand how the ranking system works exactly. I thought it was based completely on the Elo system but then the guy from Valve said it's more "complex than that"... How does it exactly work? Is it based on wins/losses, performance or both? </TEXT>
