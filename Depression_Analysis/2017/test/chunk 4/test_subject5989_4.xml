	<TEXT> That's what I've been thinking, can get it fully loaded whereas I can't afford a fully loaded STi. Although I will miss the STi badging (which I can live without I assume). Will really miss that big wing on the back (wondering where I could find one for the WRX and how much it would cost me) lol </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks for sharing, I'm in a similar situation. Big into gaming but have been wanting to get back into shape. I was 165 my whole life pretty much (I'm 6'0). Now I'm up to 212 and hate looking in the mirror. I got a fitbit and have discovered MFP which I've been using for the last 3 days or so. I've just been eating right and going for daily walks. I would like to get back into going to the gym to get a body like yourself but I have no idea where to start. What foods to eat, what exercises to do at the gym, do I write them down etc etc. Any help would be greatly appreciated! </TEXT>
