	<TEXT> My deepest, sincerest condolences. 

I hope you can see the experience as a gift.

I truly, truly do. I think it was a gift bestowed on Diane, because she's way more deserving of it than me. I'm very thankful for every single moment she spent in my life.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you, sincerely. I feel like sharing it lifts a small portion of the burden off of me. Sometimes I feel guilty that I was given an opportunity that people more deserving than me long for. 

I can only guess that it was either: actually a blessing bestowed on Diane (as she deserved a granted wish more than anyone I know), or that I *needed* an experience like that more than most, due to my own spiritual weakness. </TEXT>
