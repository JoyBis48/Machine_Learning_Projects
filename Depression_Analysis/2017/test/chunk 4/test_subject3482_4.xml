	<TEXT> That is exactly why he should get the cool haircut. So he has an awesome memory to look back on and laugh at. I love looking at photos of my parents from the 70s and 80s exactly because they are time stamped by the fashions of their day and I hope one day when I look back at photos from today, I can say, aaah "rocking it in 2015" </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you want to strike the right balance, I think rather than doing a lot of different types of programming languages (C++, Java, etc), you are better off focusing on a single type of programming and building some depth. Sometimes the easiest to pick up, and often the easiest to demonstrate to an employer is web development. So my recommendation would be to focus on a single area and do a project on that. Either contribute to an open source project on github, or build a practical app. 

Its often easier to code when you feel a sense of accomplishment and doing classes or tutorials on C++ 101 etc, rarely gives that sense of accomplishment and doesn't particularly stand out on a resume to an employer. Whether you are doing app or web development, maybe its better to do a small project that you can deploy, perhaps in combination with your networking / infrastructure skills, and that becomes a valuable thing to show as your body of work and will make you much more employable.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> All the time. Not just shows, there are so many movies I haven't watched yet (all the summer releases so far), so many TV shows (still haven't watched Breaking Bad, Sopranos, Walking Dead, OITNB), still need to get to podcasts (ReplyAll, etc.), have 1000s of items waiting on my instapaper queue. 

I think I'll have a lot of fun when I retire in 30 years. 

There is too much great content and I am not sure how everything will find audiences.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This especially happens when people are meeting either someone senior or a in a position of power (like a CEO, senior manager or something, or a celebrity). My point is a) what could they possibly say in a few minutes that would make them seem smart and b) even if they were freaking Einstein, are you really smart enough to assess that yourself. We just end up further elevating people who are in power and / or are articulate </TEXT>
