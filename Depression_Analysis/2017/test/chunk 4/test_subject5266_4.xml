	<TEXT> Definitely the worst thing about these games, to be honest, anything that fuels the war machine makes me sad. Glad we have games like Metal Gear, Spec Ops and This War of Mine to spread the counter message. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> He's super right about the unhelpful behavior on people's part. Gopher seems like a very cordial and kind hearted individual and I agree with him that the negative rage/abuse/bullying etc. is not helping the point of view against the current system.
I feel sorry for the mod authors, simply taking an opportunity presented to them, it's not being a horrible person to want money for your creations.

We just need to be empathetic towards each other as human beings, ya know?

	<TEXT>  But why does one thing being a problem mean that we can't try and fix other things?

I agree with you, I'm not saying it's a reason to not try to fix things, I'm more trying to tease out discussion on the topic :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Could you expand on that? I'm aware of that idea that sexualized women + the violence can direct the tone in a really unsettling fashion (e.g. hitman), but does sexualization inherently and problematically tie into violence for every game? Bikini chainmail female warrior fighting a monster, is that sexual violence when compared to a beautiful man in no clothes fighting the same monster?

I'm not arguing the idea, I can feel there's something wrong there but I need further clarification to build my own understanding. 

Thanks :) </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Hey /r/girlgamers what's your opinion on "sexualized" equality? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-04-19 17:23:49 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Accidently deleted my text in my post, so I have to redo:

If 50% of objectified characters were adult men, in the exact same fashion as the sexualized adult women (not the male idol fallacy, but actual objectification for the straight female gaze, or whatever) would that help the situation of objectified characters?

I should note I'm not talking about third person leery camera movements, I'm talking about design of the character. I don't think anyone really likes cringeworthy camera shots of a boob or bum or a package, but if a character is wearing skimpy clothing and they own it - equally between the sexes, does it become less of an issue?

I understand two wrongs don't make a right, but if we are going to focus on moral issues in games, isn't violence more problematic in that regard? 

I'm a sex positive bisexual male, so I'm definitely not interested in sex and sexuality being a taboo and I don't mind looking at objectified men in games either!, but I am not in the right position to make a clear assessment myself so I'm curious what people's thoughts are on adult characters being treated 50-50 equivelant. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If a game has a female protagonist, it much more easily grabs my interest. I just really enjoy playing as another gender than my own, it's like games give me an experience I don't have in my day to day that I can empathize with and find appeal in.
