	<TEXT> This article was great! I don't post much, but I just wanted to stop in and show my appreciation for an article of such quality.

It is truly unfortunate that static recompilation is difficult to use more extensively in emulation due to the inherent complexity of code.

Very good read though, it's clear that you put a lot of work into the article. Thanks for sharing. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Long term medication is a scary concept. Ive been on medication for around 7 years (growing up) and I can assure you it changes your personality. In my case, I feel overwhelmingly neutral whenever a conflict comes up. I have trouble feeling anything at all and as a result I'm terrible with women. I have never had a girlfriend even though I'm outgoing and have a decent amount of good friends. I am very critical of things that I don't agree with and I criticize those that don't understand certain situations like I do. Stay away from medication in the long term if you can. This sucks. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Alcohol can often make things harder instead of easier. There are some medications out there that will make you feel better, you just have to go to a therapist/psychiatrist to get help. Falling asleep with so much pain is terrible. If you have someone in your life who is willing to listen, talking to them will definitely help. It is the main reason i can keep from being so depressed, along with my medication. In any case, good luck with your life and try to decrease the drinking to weekends if you can. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Depression is unique because there are so many ways we experience it. I am currently in the same boat as you. Most of high school I was stepped on. You just have to keep on living. Friends were a valuable resource when i finally found some real ones. This community is also great because we can let our feelings be known and not feel so alone. Sorry if this post isnt really making a point, I'm just greatful this subreddit is here as much as you. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you're in college, try to find things in common with people in your classes. I was depressed before and now I have a small group of friends with common interests and we all support each other. It is very hard at first, but just try to chat people up. At uni most people are nice and will listen, unlike high school. I wish you luck, hope my advice was ok. </TEXT>
