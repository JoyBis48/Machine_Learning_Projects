	<TEXT> Agreed. From the other comments, the show would need to be about millionaires who inherited their wealth.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I guess the point would be to have them help others of their own volition, rather than having them help others "because it's the format of the show". Then again, there's no telling how they would react once they get their money back. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, absolutely. The knowledge that they'd be able to go back to riches would indeed be the weak link in the show. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Interesting - I'll look into it more. Though from the description of the show it seems like the donation seems like the more key feature, which I don't particularly like :\ </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Me too, but hey, in the USA most them are millionaires at the very least. They'd be eligible to be part of the show anyway :D </TEXT>

	<TITLE> A reality TV show where billionaires try living on minimum wage for at least a month. </TITLE>

	<TEXT> They would also be cut off from their own house(s), car(s), etc... but instead given 'average' lodging and vehicles comparable to what minimum wage workers make. 

Edit: The people on this show would be either politicians or millionaires who inherited their money - people that worked for their fortune wouldn't be a good fit. </TEXT>
