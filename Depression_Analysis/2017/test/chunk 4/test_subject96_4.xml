	<TEXT> The Thirteenth Floor(1999) is pretty much the exact same premise at The Matrix, people living in a computer simulation and unaware of it. 

It's (loosely) based on a book from 1964 called Simulacron-3. I read that book twenty years ago because I had heard that it was a proto-matrix story. In it, each individual's personality is saved on a giant, rotating storage drum. It's very cool, in that retro-future kind of way. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Is this really so confusing? A university has the power to kick a student out, either temporarily or permanently for any number of things, including things that are not crimes.  That's the extent of their jurisdiction and their power to enforce their rulings.

	<TEXT> I've heard this quite a bit and it's not that simple. 

I think that it's reasonable to say that a university can and should take action in cases where the evidence for guilt isn't quite strong enough for a criminal conviction. Furthermore, I would argue that there are actions that might not rise to the level of a criminal complaint but could and should warrant a sanction of the offending party and/or protection of the victim. You can name any number of instances outside the sexual assault spectrum where this is true.

But trying to be fair in these cases is a really difficult problem. There are political pressures from all sides. The rules of how to proceed are wildly inconsistent. The people adjudicating the process generally don't have any training or expertise and can often be quite biased. No to mention that trying to fairly figure out what two drunken college kids actually did in a darkened room with no witnesses is nearly impossible. </TEXT>

I bought my first computer in 1983 with money I saved from my paper route. As an aside, there's another thing consigned to the dustbin of history, the paper route.

I got a Commodore 64. It cost me $300. The price had just been cut from $600 and I jumped right on that. I couldn't swing the money for a floppy drive, so I got the attachment that let me save my programs on a cassette tape. Later on I'd get the money for a real disk drive and a 300 baud modem. I was living in the future. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not sure where you are, but federal minimum wage is $7.25/hr. That's roughly four and a tenth hours for thirty bucks, not three.

Either way, the law is clear. You must be paid for all hours worked.  If you feel that you'll be fired if you speak up, it may be in your best interest to keep quiet.

Perhaps you can approach your boss and ask him what he thinks the best course of action is. Tell him that to do the job correctly takes five hours, but you're not being paid for all that time. What would he like you to do?

You can always keep a written log of all hours worked. In fact, I would suggest this. Depending on the state you're in, the labor board may make the company make you whole when you leave the job. In most states, you'd have to sue.    </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, I just don't agree. 

The McNulty arc was just plain stupid. The newspaper story was boring. A lot of the characters did dumb things that I just didn't believe they would do. I really felt the hand of David Simon moving the characters around in very unnatural ways to suit the story he wanted to tell and the sledghammer of message he wanted to hit the audience with.

I never watched The Wire when it was first on. I got caught up a couple years ago when Cablevision got HBO GO and I binged the whole sixty episodes in the span of two months. So I took the show as it came and I didn't have a lot of time to chew over the episodes or get attached to the show the way a lot of people did. 

I think sometimes people get attached to great shows like The Wire and they make excuses when they end poorly.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I work in a very safety-conscious environment, so I'm always thinking about how things might fail in an unsafe way. I'd worry that people might want to use this like a sous vide machine, set it up and let it cook by itself for hours or days. 

Problem being, if the Meld has a glitch or fails in some bad way, you could easily have a bad fire.

Hopefully you'll include a strong warning not to let the Meld work unattended and perhaps a physical OFF switch so it can't turn on accidentally. You might also consider having it have the ability to send an alert/alarm to the user's phone if there's an issue or malfunction.

I think this is a very neat idea and if I hadn't exceeded my toy-buying budget for the nonce, I'd pre-order one. 

Good luck! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Can I still use the burner with the Meld knob as a regular burner?

Also, have you thought about safety concerns? Is there some kind of auto cut off if the temp goes too high? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you're just counting years from the start of the show, you're clearly correct about the date.

On the other hand, the events in the last episode are clearly the Viking sack of Paris that happened in 845 in the Earth Prime timeline. Not to mention that Athestan's child with Judith is almost certainly Alfred the Great, which makes it 849 AD.

Furthermore, it seems like we're seeing Rollo being set up to be Rollo/Robert of Normandy,  which is even later down the timeline.

The show is basically a Viking Saga, so things like continuity and accuracy are not high on the lift of priorities. I just wouldn't get all hung up on what year it is. Just enjoy the ride. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Except that that's Charles The Bald on the throne in Paris and he won't even be born until 823.

My only point is that it's silly to try and talk about what the real year is in the show. It's a mishmash. It's like a show where the main character fights along side George Washington at Yorktown and a few years later he's hanging out with President Abe Lincoln and discussing the Gettysburg Address.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The show plays pretty fast and  loose with the time and events.

The show begins with the Viking raid on Linsdisfarne in 793 CE, but the events happening now take place in 845 CE. The Vikings, lead by the person who may or may not have been the historical Ragnar Lothbrok, raided Paris in 845. 

Hirst basically takes people and events from the late 8th through the late 9th century and squashes them all together as he likes to make the story.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The article calls it a patent, but other articles I've read refer to it as a trademark. Trademarks don't expire, as far as I know, so I was unclear as to what the actual issue is.

I used intellectual property because it seemed generic enough to cover whatever it might be. </TEXT>
