With regards to therapy, I'm actually being taught medical hypnosis at the moment - which sounds whacked, but you do it to yourself, and it's basically a kind of meditation where you combat low self esteem by convincing yourself that you're actually worthwhile and things like that. So far it's working.  </TEXT>

What I'd meant was that I had unwittingly been an example of how men see an emotionally strong and confident male, and the benefit that such an attitude of emotional self-reliance brings them, and instantly try to emulate it - or believe that they are inferior for not being able to do so. It's a knee-jerk reaction to someone you perceive to be 'better' than you.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> everyone hates having me around them

As someone who used to think the same thing, I can assure you that they don't. I have atrocious self-esteem (it's getting better, and I'll tell you why), and frequently would go out with my friends and return home feeling like shit because of all the stupid things I've said or done. Focus in every tiny little thing that indicates that someone hated me, even though they'd been friends with me for years. I was utterly convinced that all these people despised me. This was because I deliberately sought out *excuses* to hate myself - evidence to support the warped view I had of myself. I would focus on every little thing I had done, and either blow it way out of proportion (like a joke that wasn't THAT funny, but could have been worse, becoming the most stupid fucking thing I've ever said) or come up with reasons why they actually hate me for it - which are completely unreasonable. I focused on every little bad thing I'd done and completely ignored everything good, or rationalised the good things to actually be a way to hate myself. So all I saw were bad things, all the time. You, I think, are doing the same. My friends, not being severely depressed, only saw the many good things - good jokes, kind gestures, insightful statements, general friend things - and none of the bad, because I hadn't actually done anything wrong. They thought I was cool. But I just couldn't see it, because I was so determined to prove them all wrong and took such pleasure in destroying myself. 

In summary, I can assure you that people love to be around you. You either don't notice the signs or are deliberately telling yourself they're wrong. If they didn't like you, they'd tell you to fuck off to your face.  </TEXT>
