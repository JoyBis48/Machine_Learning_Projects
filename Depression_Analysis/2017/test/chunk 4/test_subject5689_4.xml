	<TEXT> [Here](http://i.imgur.com/iJlJahd.jpg) is a picture of our dog with her mother and her siblings. We can trace her lineage back to the founding dogs of the breed, but I understand that white huskies cause confusion. We get people asking us what breed she is all the time! :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> From my wife- the raw expert and also a dog trainer: "It varies depending on what sources are available and what version of raw. We do 'Prey Model Raw' and to feed two 40 pound dogs and 2 cats is about $2-3 per day. We get a lot of free meat from hunters as well, and get great deals by buying in bulk from co-ops." Hope this helps! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I can't speak for the other dog, since I just met him today, but my dog is raw fed, which helps with their coat. </TEXT>
