	<TEXT> AWD = all wheel drive, which is all the wheels turning at the same time.  They're all driven off the same engine and same
 transfer case.  Now that you know that, here is the second part...  Different sized tires on one car, have to spin at different RPM's in order to turn at the same speed.  Add those together and you have a problem for transfer cases. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, I would now encourage my kids to make as much noise as possible, and save that letter to show the police when they show up. I would then ask them to file a harassment charge on said "neighbor".  God save said person if they decided to not call the police and try to confront my kids themselves.  I'll be the first one to give someone a dirty look if their kids are acting up in public when it's not appropriate, but I'll be dead in the grave before someone tells me how to act in my own god dammed yard!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You smoked for a few years.  Good for you, you got lucky, so far.  I'll bet money that you'll have health problems in the future.   If you would of kept using, you would of developed issues.  I had a good friend who used for years.  He was a super clean freak, showered, shaved,  brushed his teeth and everything, but his teeth were bad and getting worse, he was always breaking out in sores, and he eventually blew his brains out.  The shit some pharmaceutical company makes in a lab is NOTHING like street meth.  Nothing. If you think it is, then go back to doing meth, and check in with me in 10 years, if you can.  Meth will destroy your internal organs too. Can't blame that on poor hygiene.   </TEXT>

Why do you think doing meth for 10 years ages people 30+ years?  And don't give me any shit about how it's all the bad shit they put in meth to cut it.  There isn't really such a thing as pure meth that anyone on the street is going to find.  </TEXT>

But can a woman land a guy that's better looking, with her personality, the way men can?  Usually not.
