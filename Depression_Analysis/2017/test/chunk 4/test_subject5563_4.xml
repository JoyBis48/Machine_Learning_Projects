	<TEXT> Wouldn't mind hearing Muse have a crack it. As I understand, they were being considered for Skyfall. Supposedly [Supremacy by Muse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avM_UsVo0IA) was their take on a Bond song, pretty catchy. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I recommend Arrow as well. The first half of Season 1 can be a bit silly as it is trying to find its footing but towards the end of Season 1 the show becomes really special imo. The character development is really great, especially for a show like Arrow. Season 2 is amazing as it becomes more of a personal battle since they bring in a pretty big villain (not going to say who), they just do a really good job of world building imo especially since they are going to cross over with the Flash as well.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I also have an MSI R9 280x which has been factory over clocked, however because its over clocked it does make the game artefact. Download MSI Afterburner and down clock the card using that program. These are my settings and I haven't experienced any artefacts or weird texture stretching.

Core Clock: 1020 Mhz
Memory Clock: 1160 Mhz

Everything else is left at default settings. Give that a go and see if it works. I'm currently running it in Mantle.

	<DATE> 2014-09-30 06:17:55 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> What I mean by this is the blue computer like hud interface they had. I felt it looked more slicker than the one in BF4. Especially when you're getting points/killing opponents, the way the points screen animates on the bottom really made me prefer it. Maybe i'm wrong however in that the one in BF4 just works better since it's more simpler and straight the point (been a while since I played BF3). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This game. Where do I begin? Deus Ex:HR was probably my GOTY for 2011 and while I understand that it had its flaws, the gameplay, level design and music all came together beautifully. It is one of the games where I feel that the sequel may be near perfect if they do it right and learn from the mistakes of HR (boss fights, providing equal xp no matter your playstyle and an overhaul of the graphics). The art style of this game is amazing, the gold and yellow hues of the cyberpunk renaissance (as they call it) exude that overly lit up, light polluting world of the future. If anyone is interested here are some screen shots I had taken that further reinforce how awesome the art style simply is.

and finally my personal favourite.

	<TEXT> Not sure about programming but Michael Mann's new film Blackhat is about a hacker so that could be interesting since he does a stupid amount of research in films on said subjects.

EDIT here's a [link](http://collider.com/blackhat-comic-con-panel-recap/) on the reasearch he did. 

**As part of his research, Mann started hanging out with some black hat hackers, and discovered that they can do 7 to 8 hours of coding in one go, and it creates both a sense of escapism and a bit of an opiate feedback loop.  But its important to note that its not an escape because their work goes into the real world and can create serious repercussions.

	<TEXT> The only things I agree with you were the personality of the robots and the performances from the actors. The pacing however was one of the biggest offenders of the film along side its product placement. The film was pretty much 3 hours long and it did not need to be at all. Just when you think it's almost over...BAM the whole Hong Kong section begins. It did have some cool elements such as the main transformer villain and the dinobots but that was it for me really.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Honestly release it on the PS4, even though I bought the game on PC I felt that the overall population of the game was cut down somewhat by not having it on another platform to build a name brand for itself. Now i'm not saying that was the only problem but they also segregated the community quite early on which lead to it being pretty much dead here in Australia.  </TEXT>
