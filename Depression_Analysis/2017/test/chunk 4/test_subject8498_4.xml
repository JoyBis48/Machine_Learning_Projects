	<TEXT> This may come off as pretty random but, as an argentinian, me da mucha vergenza los comentarios que algunos de mis compatriotas hacen frente a lo que pas, alegrndose del caos.  Espero que entiendan que no todos los argentinos somos tan estpidos como para pensar que que les pasen cosas malas a nuestros vecinos de Chile es motivo de festejo. De todo corazn deseo que puedan recuperarse pronto y siento mucho las perdidas que han sufrido.

Edit: sorry, a bit of context. Some argentinians hate chileans and visceversa, which is of course a pretty idiotic thing to do, and they are glad each time something like this happens in Chile. I'm just saying to the guy that as an argentinian myself I hope he doesn't think we are all like that and that I'm very sorry about what happened and hoping that they recover from their losses soon. Sorry to hijack the comment thread but I didn't come cross a chilean these days and seeing what my fellow countryman are saying, just wanted to put it out there. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Have you ever heard about that theory that says in the future a super intelligent AI will take control of the planet and it's robot minions will torture you basically for eternity unless you've contributed to their creation? And also they have a method in which they can tell exactly how many times you thought about this without doing anything, and each time only makes it worse and they torture you even harder for it? 

I read it on Reddit, of course. It's like The Game but super hardcore mode.

EDIT: got a link, apparently it's called "Roko's Basilisk" http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Roko%27s_basilisk </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's a great saying. This is actually a known process, which of course I can't recall the name now (maybe someone else does) in which the person uses every bit of information, even the ones that contradict them, to build their belief stronger. For example, a pseudoscience study comes along saying that vaccinations and autism are severely related = this must be true, their belief grows stronger. Then a scientific study properly made comes along and says vaccinations and autism aren't related = this must be false, their belief grows stronger. It's very irritating. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Dawkings talks abouts theories that are backed up with science, and doesn't say (nor denies) that atoms are sentient, because he (scientifical community as a whole actually) doesn't have the slightlest evidence that would point towards that. Chopra could be right, but he's talking out of his ass, he has absolutely NO evidence to support what he's saying, and he says it smiling and ridiculising science. It's very upseting. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I like to sit, take 1 hour, put Netflix, and roll myself 8 or 10 joints. I first grind the bud, then carefully cut the filters and proceed with the rolling. I take my time so that every joint is perfect and nice in size and thick. I enjoy so much this process.  

Then, I save them in a metal Camel box I have that's only meant for saving joints.   

It's beautiful. It's good. It brings me joy. 

I haven't smoked in a couple of months. Now I've got my job back, money coming, and as I write this I'm waiting to go pick up the bud I love so much. Smiling is inevitable right now.

Just wanted to share it :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hm, yes, you are correct; I did misinterpret the vignette here. But, although the photographer (or editor) didn't use a vignette technique, I stand saying there's an over saturation of the colors and lighting of the face in comparison to the rest of the picture. That, and the natural framing of the background (that tends to darken to the edges) produce a very much vignette alike effect on the eye.  

So, while technically the use of vignette isn't here (we can notice that if we look at the evenly lightened grass), the effect achieved is the same, by other techniques. For my taste, the lion's face "stands out too much", as in an excess for seeking attention to it.

Let us all please remember that photography is a form of art, and as in all forms of art you can bend and break rules (to a point I believe), and althought I wouldn't have processed this picture as it is because I dislike the end result, I believe it's what the photographer wanted and I respect that. Of course constructive criticism helps, and it should be fomented, not bashed in saying "redditors say it's over processed always".  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I too am a professional photographer, and what /u/drakeg4 is saying is essentially correct. Use of vigneting should be subtle in most cases (of course there are no unbreakable rules in these fields), and generally an excess of it produces a weird effect. It's mostly used to emulate natural frames and help the composition of the photo by drawing the eye to the desired point, but here I too believe it's overused.  

I also see an over saturation of the face colors in comparison with the rest of the photo. Again, to each it's own and I believe the photographer achieved what he wanted, that this is the final result he had in mind. But I also don't like it and I think the argument that the user you replied to have is far from invalid. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi!

Well, I read here somewhere that tachyons aren't possible because they represent a violation in causality. So far so good. But, the explanation to why this happens doesn't quite get in my head. A redditor kindly wrote an example about two spaceships that are in a duel. The two of them travel away from each other at great velocity until they count 10 seconds, and then spaceship A fires their tachyon cannons to spaceship B. But, because of time dilation, 5 seconds have passed for spaceship B when they get hit, so they respond immediatly by firing, sending the blast before spaceship A fired the initial shot.

Now, I get why that violates causality (obviously), but the thing I don't get is; why does time dilation makes the time happen differently for both spaceships if they're traveling away from each other at the same speed? Wouldn't their 10 seconds be the same 10 seconds for both of them since they're at same speed? </TEXT>
