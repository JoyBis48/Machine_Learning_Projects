	<TEXT> I'm still a fan of sslauncher. It takes a while to figure it out, but once you do there isn't much you can't do. Gridless screen to place stuff exactly, can overlap them and move them from front to back, has great options even before using zooper or the like, has a separate header area at the top of the screen that can follow different rules. Plus it will work on much older devices than nova. 

Or when I want a customized look without the effort, I'll use buzz launcher and download someone else's customized screen.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As I go through custum roms, I notice that very few have a 180 option when they have the options in their display settings. That is, not only is there a rotate screen toggle, some roms have toggles for 0,90, 270, while even fewer have a 180 toggle.  I think it's a rom restriction. Right now I'm on CM7 on a Droid X2 so I can be on Straight Talk over the Verizon network, and in my CyanogenMod settings  Accelerometer rotation I have toggles for all four views.

edit: Didn't mention that the rotation works for all apps that work in those mods. So games that only are landscape work on either 90 or 270, when they are toggled in my settings, and something else that rotates, say bacon reader, works on all four sides. I haven't seen an app that was restricted beyond what rotations are toggled.

edit2: I take that back. I seem to remember one game that only worked at 90, wouldn't flip to the other side for some reason. Had to be the app restricting it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I tried to be the 44% a couple weeks ago. I didn't know I had 2 months left on my contract with Dish when I called to cancel my $60 a month subscription, but told them I wanted to cancel anyway. I told them there wasn't anything they had to offer that I couldn't stream outside of the Weather Channel and the sports I couldn't get over the air. They ended up giving me a much better package plus all the premiums for $25 a month for 3 months without extending my contract and can cancel at any time. So in 2 months I can go ahead and join the 44% while saving a few bucks on the last 2 bills.
