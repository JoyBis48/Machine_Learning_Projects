	<TEXT> You want to know what is wrong with the tea cup ride?! That fact that it isn't a ride that has a height requirement. I want to enjoy the rides that my kids CAN'T go on!  Totally forgot about the restaurant in Pirates. I will have to go there, too! Childless. Yes!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Fun fact:
My husband and I are going to Disneyland next Friday for our anniversary... Without any of our 3 kids. Muahahaha(that was evil laughter, in case you couldn't tell)! This way we get to ride the bigger kid rides. Screw the little kids and their stupid Teacup and It's a Small World rides. I am about to make your plot twist a reality! BAM! </TEXT>
