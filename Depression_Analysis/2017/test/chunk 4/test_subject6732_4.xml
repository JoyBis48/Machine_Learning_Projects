	<TEXT> SINCE A COUPLE OF DAYS I HAVEN'T BEEN DOING MY FUCKING BEST IN LIFE. EACH NIGHT WHEN I SLEEP THERE IS A VACUUM INSIDE MY DISSATISFIED HEART SOMEWHERE. IT GIVES ME THE FEELING OF VAGUE REGRET. IT'S A WARNING SIGN THAT SAYS THERE IS SOMETHING FUCKING WRONG WITH HOW I'M INVESTING TIME IN LIFE.

I KNOW I WILL BOUNCE BACK. BUT I DON'T FUCKING LIKE TO KEEP BOUNCING BETWEEN GOOD AND BAD FEELINGS SO GODDAMN FREQUENTLY. I DON'T WANT TO BE LIKE THE PRICE OF A STOCK ON THE SHAREMARKET.. I WANT TO BE FUCKING CONSISTENT IN MY PLANS AND LIVING. 

CONSISTENCY IS FUCKING NECESSARY TO ME FOR WHAT I TOOK UP TO ACHIEVE IN MY LIFE RIGHT NOW. BUT I'M FUCKING TIRED OF TRYING TO BOUNCE BACK EVERY TIME I FEEL LIKE THIS.

THIS QUOTE IS APT FOR PEOPLE LIKE ME RIGHT NOW:

	<TEXT> No. Harry is the only survivor on whom the killing curse is *performed*.. so technically Voldemort can't be called as a survivor as he wasn't *performed* the curse upon, and moreover he wasn't a survivor at all... He disappeared at that moment.. and was almost dead... so no he did not survive.. he yielded to its effect. </TEXT>

I FUCKING DON'T HAVE ANY IDEA WHY IT IS SO. 

**ARE WE FUCKING AFRAID TO SHARE WHAT THE HELL IS HAPPENING IN OUR GODDAMN LIVES?**

**ARE WE FUCKING SHY TO RISE FROM THE AHSES AND BE THE PHOENIXES THAT WE ARE?**

WHAT THE HELL IS STOPPING US FROM COMING AND CONNECTING WITH THE LOVELY BROTHERHOOD AND SHARE SOME FUCKING MOTIVATION?

OK... ENOUGH RANT.. NOW, BORROWING THE WORDS FROM GANDHI, I WOULD RATHER BE THE CHANGE I WANT TO SEE IN THE GODDAMN WORLD AROUND ME. SO I'M GOING TO MAKE POSTS HERE REGULARLY. 

I DON'T KNOW IF ANY BUTTHOLE OUT THERE IS LISTENING TO THIS BUT I REALLY WANT US TO BE GODDAMN WINNERS IN OUR CHOSEN ASPECTS OF LIFE, WHATEVER THE FUCK THEY MAY BE.

	<TEXT> Great idea.. and it's most of the times true in my case as well. Music has myriad times influenced my mood to write.. It moved me so much that I once immediately started to write a poetic piece, which I felt as my best work yet. (It's a heartfelt message to my girlfriend while I was in college.)

Most of the times it is film sound tracks.. Hans Zimmer, especially.. I'm from India, so I would like to more names to it: A.R.Rahman, Shankar-Eshaan-Loy, Amit Trivedi etc.. These people's music had influenced my thought process many times and pushed me towards writing something refreshing, which I didn't have in mind moment prior to listening to their music..

However, I don't everytime get influenced by music alone in order to put my thoughts to words. No body should, because it will make you feel dependant on it. That's not how creativity shold work always. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Let me ask: what kind of an idiot helps a person who he met only days ago, and assists him in killing a person, or rather commit the murder himself?? I mean, there was nothing where he questions Raymond what is the real matter behind all those Arabs following him and why is he carrying a revolver. He always agrees for whatever Raymond asks for, not just about partying out, but also in hurting and killing somebody. What is existentialism? Is it straight ahead killing somebody whom you think is trying to harm you? Why did nobody, neither the protagonist nor Raymond, ever tried to speak it out with the Arabs before using the weapon, guys?? What kind of *ism* is that?? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have been trying to read one book per week this year.. so this week i picked up *The Stranger* by Albert Camus, looking at its classic status, and also because it is a small book (I like small books). I've enterted into the Part II of the book just now, and all along Part I the book seemed to be having no soul or story - it just went on and on randomly to here and there - with characters that came up having no good depth.. and also the narration is pretty dull. I guess this is the book in a long time that I read half without finding a single quote to highlight.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah.. why not.. Positive thinking/attitude has proven multiple times that it can make great changes in the world.. and in people's lives.. Although telekinesis would directly mean moving things physically, optimistic mindset also appears to do the same with the situations of life - it physically changes the circumstances of a person's life and makes him get what he desired. For example, **placebo effect**- the way people think and perceive a situation literally makes changes in the same. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I will never give out spoilers for anything.. I hate ruining any kind of experiences of people.. That being said, I felt The Giver as just ok because I don't enjoy dystopian novels very much.. They just feel very depressing. I'm not good with the books that give out such feeling.. I even disliked *1984* by George Orwell especially for this reason, while I loved his *Animal Farm*.

Talking particularly about *The Giver* the narration seemed a bit different and most of the times very straight not bothering about exploring the feelings of characters in depth, although it helped in keeping the book short, which I like. 

So, you might completely enjoy the book if you're fine with dystopian concepts - it's a good book for those who enjoy such setting.

	<TITLE> What would be the right interpretation of this paragraph? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-01-16 07:26:57 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm reading Shunryu Suzuki's *Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind.* In Part 2 of the book I encountered this paragraph:

*Practice should be directed from achievement to non-achievement. Usually when you do something, you want to achieve something, you attach to some result. From achievement to non-achievement means to be rid of the unneccesary and bad results of effort. If you do something in the spirit of non-achivement, there is a good quality in it. So just to do something without any particular effort is enough.*

But, let's say I'm preparing for a National level entrance exam that would put me into a great college for higher education. So, I will surely be attached towards a result - to get into the top college in the country. But that paragraph speaks against it.

Am I looking at it the wrong way? What would be the actual interpretation of that paragraph in this scenario?

and can also be blissful.. trust me.. the kind of solitude you will experience while travelling and visiting places alone, in a way, such solitude can not be attained even by meditation. It is such. It can be enlightnening, but for that you need to retrsopect into your life and talk to your conscience.. Take some books with you that talk about nature and world around you, even such poetry would do.. Go, explore the solitary travels. Good Luck :)  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Today I was listening to some podcast where the panel members mentioned that in the recent days there are many, many new planets that are being continuously discovered and that most of them are just gas planets. Listening to that I got this doubt: 

*Considering the Big Bang theory, wasn't our Earth too a gas planet at its infancy, which later cooled down and developed into a full fledged life-supporting home? So, if those new planets are now designated as gas planets, doesn't that give way to the possibility of them turning into life suppoorting planets later on in the unvierse's eventual timeline, just like Earth did??* </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah that's a good idea.. In my country (India) a recent best selling book series called: *Shiva Trilogy* by Amish Tripati had a smiliar experience. The first book in the series was rejected by nearly 20 publishers.. and so he made a trailer of the book's concept and released it on Youtube.. and also released the first chapter. People liked and the buzz grew around it.. and eventually publishing companies came to him and published his book. Now, his trilogy is a massively famous book series in India. And I even heard that for his next book, which he hasn't even written, a publishing house already bought the rights in advance with a price of around 5 crore rupees.. 

So, yes just try putting a part of it infront of the people and see what happens. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't understand why publishers/editors reject a book even after thinking it's a good one. How can they decide that a book won't be liked by people when they didn't even publish it? I think they're the most judgemental people on the planet. Really sorry for your situation. But I'm sure something WILL turn up and your book WILL be published.. It's all about the time. Let it take the time it is asking for.. You will surely be rewarded worthily. I will give you an example.. 

*When I was doing masters, almost 80% of my class got recreuited from campus but among the other 20% was one of my best friends in the class.. he tried like all of us but he couldn't get through all that year. Eventaully when the college was over, he left without a job in hand unlike most of his classmates.. He needed a job desperately. He persevered another year, and on Dec 24th, 2013 he was recruited as a Banker by the biggest private bank in India. (Yeah, this is all from India). And his salary is higher than the average salary of the entire batch. Well, he waited and persevered, and he got better than what most people did.*

I believe in such things.. and now in your case also something makes me feel the same way. You will rise! </TEXT>

I don't know if you ever heard of Chetan Bhagat.. He is India's best selling author.. and also the most criticized.. Well, I'm a great fan of him... Now, me being his fan, in my country if I say I'm an elitist, the actual elite people will beat me to hell. Believe me. If you don't, then google the criticism for Chetan Bhagat.. 

I'm not an elitist. Life is more enjoyable when you have a reading habit.. and having that habit I feel my life is better in terms of interestingness than a non-readers life. That's just my feeling, not an elitist way of looking at the world. If you still feel that way, then I'm sorry, pal. Keep hating me :) </TEXT>

By that what I meant is that a person who is reading something that *he* feels is interesting to him has the right to feel the work is worthy of investing his own time and concentration, no matter what other people think about it.. For example, many people criticise Dan Brown and Malcom Gladwell, but both are my favourite Fiction and Non-Fiction authors respectively. I feel their books are worthy of my time and thought.. That is all what I meant.. </TEXT>
