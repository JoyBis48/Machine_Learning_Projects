	<TEXT> They need to alert Brock and Reigns to plan out a new finish to the match. Hence they needed all three at the same time for this. The Stomp = F5 = Spear = Stomp = pin looks like it was planned with detail, and won't happen if any one of them was out of the loop </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Meltzer believes that Lesnar was fully informed of the new plan before he signed his new contract last Tuesday.

This I think is the most crucial part of that. It shows that the creative already had it planned, but kept it from both Seth and Reigns. The decision might even be because of Bork himself, as he might have refused a new contract if he was pinned.

Reigns and the whole Anoa'i family might have been told after Royal Rumble that he would win, but they changed heart after all the heat he is getting, which makes sense with all the dirtsheet news we are reading

Or, this is just an elaborate April Fool by Meltzer </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The irony is the BBC needs him as much as he needs the BBC. 

The reason that Top Gear works is that Top Gear buys most the cars (with taxpayer's money mind you) they feature on the show (except for special cars like from Ferrari), hence when the presenters gave some bad reviews, car companies can't retaliate. This is what makes Top Gear special, as they can basically say what they want without repercussion, something other car shows, which the cars are sponsored, can't do </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Watching it in a cinema is awesome, especially with the 7.1 audio. 

- animation is as good as it can be, but the CGI sometime looks overdone. I love how the crowd was animated/CGI'ed. They do not look copy pasted, but looks like a crowd of individuals

- I know the manga was kind of funny. But I never expected they would keep it in the movie. Lucifer/Ral adventure was kinda weird to watch, but man it was funny

- After watching this, now I realised why Char/Casval hated Amuro. He was the original angsty, emo kid in a death machine and Amuro stole that gimmick </TEXT>
