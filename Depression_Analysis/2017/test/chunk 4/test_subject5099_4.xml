I see another guy in the desert, 2 shot him, see 2 more in the distance, run up and kill them both, turn around and kill another, and then go down into a temple to re-brew and heal. All this took less than a minute. As it turned out, there was enough diamonds left on the ground for full diamond, but I couldn't pick them up. :D (I won after 2 more kills if you didnt guess) </TEXT>
