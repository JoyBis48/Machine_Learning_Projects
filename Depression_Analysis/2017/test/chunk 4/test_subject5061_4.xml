	<TEXT> You are 100% right. I can't believe how stupid people are by assuming that yellow card meant the occupants are worth more than anyone else because they have a child in their car. In an accident, a car can suffer extreme compaction, as a result, a small child might be overlooked in a crushed part of a car. Hence the baby on board sign.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Shooting anyone, even if totally justified, will change your life. I personally go to great lengths to avoid drawing on someone even if it is legally justified. 

Carrying a firearm is a great responsibility. Slights, insults, and other infractions by others can be ignored because you are carrying and those insults are thus not real challenges to your honor or manhood. 

I was not there so I am not trying to criticize. I just know that drawing on someone or shooting them, even if 100% justified, will open up a Costco sized can of worms that will likely not be pleasant for everyone involved.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I may be wrong but I think OP may have exacerbated the situation by playing dumb and asking the guy why he was angry. Obviously the guy was angry because his car was blocked by OP's bike. OP knew his bike was blocking guy's car and that was the only reason he was angry. It seems as if OP may have been trying to bait the guy by leaving bike there for longer than necessary.

If I were investigating this situation I would have asked both if they had had any previous negative encounters with each other. I would ask why the delay in moving the bike. I would ask why bike was not stored in front of OP's car rather than requiring him to move it every time he wanted to use his car.

 I may be 100% wrong but something does not add up here.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>   rate of increase in global emissions that stalled.

What is the rate? Is that rate significant?

This is only from the energy sector. Not the transportation or construction (i.e. cement) sectors.

A flatline in one major sector is significant. If there was a relationship between world economies and CO2 levels then ANY increase or decrease from any CO2 producing economic sector should effect general ambient CO2 levels. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The reasons Conservatives and the GOP are against climate change is  because:

1. We believe that Leftist political interests have corrupted climate science.

2. Saying that an area of science "is settled" is contrary to the scientific method.

3. The proposed solutions to climate change by the Left involve increasing taxes, increasing regulation, and empowering elites. These so called solutions are extremely expensive and any results achieved would be miniscule and not guaranteed.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Southern Strategy:

The Southern strategy is often misunderstood because of an interview with Lee Atwater in which he uses the term "nigger nigger". Some who do not understand what he is saying consider this snippet to mean the GOP is embracing racism to attract disaffected Dixiecrat voters.

That assumption is incorrect. What Atwater was saying in plain English was that the GOP DOES NOT have to resort to pleas to racism to attract disenchanted southern democrat voters. The GOP had to only appeal to economic issues to attract them. 

The link I provided proved that there was no Southern Strategy to use racism because the data proved that the shift of southern democrats to the GOP was NOT as a result of the civil rights movement. The shift was a long continuous 4 decade process.

Please consider the logic of this. Why would any party embrace a tiny portion of the voting public (racists) at the expense of offending 95+ percent of the voting public? Such a strategy would doom a party to failure.  

If conservatives are so opposed to big government and government spending

You have to realize that the GOP does not equal Conservative. The GOP consists of several factions including big spending establishment RINOs such as McCain, Christie, Bush, etc, the Tea Party Conservatives than want smaller, less expensive, less intrusive government, Libertarians etc. 

Conservative Tea Party opposes expansion of government regardless of if it is proposed by the Left or the establishment wing of the GOP. 

equate socialism to communism which its not.

According to Marx, socialism is an intermediary step on the political continuum towards communism. All socialists aren't communists but all communists are socialist. As a Conservative, I oppose all forms of socialism or communism. 

You need to study some history man. Europe has thrived under social democracy so has canada.

Are you including the noted socialist regimes of the Soviet Union, Maoist China, Pol Pot's Khmer Rouge, Hitler's nazis Germany, Castro's Cuba, Mussolini's Italy? Those regimes are responsible for the deaths of 150 million people over the past century.

Please don't confuse full socialist states with socialist lite systems such as Scandinavia or Canada. Such systems can afford social welfare because they are rich countries who do not have to pay for their military security. Such states are not paradises. They are dealing with very real economic issues, declining population, and a deteriorating immigration policy that allows non integrating outsiders to change their societies. Such systems are not likely to survive.

I believe that the Tea Party movement is a response to a black man in the Oval Office and conservative appeasement of these whack jobs has done a serious disservice to the right. I used to consider myself a centrist until people like Michelle Bachman and Sarah Palin hijacked the gop and all the Anti-scientific and pro-religious sentiments were amplified and became central to the party.

  1. Can you provide proof that the Tea Party is racist? No such proof exists.

 The Tea Party stands for 3 things:

Lower taxes, less regulation, and smaller government.

I am a hard core Tea Party Conservative. I am also an atheist, a scientist, I don't give a shit who smokes what or who marries who. 

Conservatives are not anti science. We believe that the issue of climate change has become polluted with political ideology and thus the data can't be trusted. The solutions to climate change proposed by the Left involve massive tax increases and empowerment of elites. 

Conservatives believe Liberals are wrong.

Liberals believe Conservatives are evil.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The first thing I'd like to say is look up the Republican southern strategy. It is an openly racist policy that is denied or spun by conservatives but their policies don't match their words.

Southern strategy claim debunked:
http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2013/04/the-southern-strategy-debunked-again.php

More white people are on welfare, food stamps etc than minorities

37.6% of food stamps were being allotted to White non-Hispanics. African Americans were allotted 23.6% of SNAP benefits. 


http://www.fns.usda.gov/sites/default/files/2012Characteristics.pdf


Welfare statistics. Black and white percentages are essentially equal at 39%

http://www.statisticbrain.com/welfare-statistics/

Being opposed to socialist, Leftist, Progressive policies does not equate to racism.

Conservatives are opposed to a huge government constantly getting bigger, taxing more, and making regulations endlessly. We view power as a zero sum game. Power is finite and with every right or freedom the government takes over, the less rights and power the people have to decide their own destinies. 

Not directly but conservative policy would effectively strip or limit the country of its social safety net

We want smaller government not no government. Liberals always play this false all or nothing claim. We feel that economic opportunities are far better for all people than endless government subsidy slavery.

So you don't judge policy on its merits you judge it on its political leaning or political class that proposes it.

We are philosophically opposed to Leftist policies. Period. I do not view Leftist policies as being beneficial to the country or our people. I view Leftism as a cancer on society, government, and the people. This does not mean I am against helping the truly needy with government assistance. I simply reject Leftist government turning entire classes of people into dependent slaves to social welfare programs. 

You sound like your indoctrinated as opposed to having a political affiliation. Any thing that is from us is good, anything that is from them is bad. You don't see the problem in this?

This comes down to political philosophy. I follow the beliefs of the founding fathers, classical liberals but not Leftist Liberals. I view today's Liberal progressive Left as being a static, rigid path to classical socialism... nothing more. 

As a Conservative I believe that America offers a different path towards raising all members of society economically, politically, socially, personally. Socialism is diametrically opposed to my political, economic, and personal goals. Socialism has been a disaster for  every society that has tried it historically. There is a reason for that failure. Please consider why it has failed in the past....

I'm not gonna bombard you with a battle of links because I'm sure you realize we can both find Internet sources to back up anything we say. I'm trying to keep things on a general level. I'm not a hater and I'm not looking to trash you or your beliefs.

Thank you </TEXT>

Being opposed to socialist, Leftist, Progressive policies does not equate to racism. 

I and other Conservatives are opposed to almost ANY progressive policy and ANY progressive politician. Race, sex, religion, orientation is totally irrelevant. 

If Hillary becomes president, I will oppose almost everything she proposes. If Al Gore becomes president I will oppose almost everything he proposes. Same with ANY other Democrat/Leftist/progressive. 

It is my belief that the whole GOP=racism is a Democrat lie, intentionally told in order to stifle debate of issues. Democrat philosophy is to demonize opponents so that voters don't even have to explore contrary opinions. Why would you even entertain the views of a mean racist?  

If you really don't think the GOP has racist policies you have buried your head in the sand, a quick Google search will not disappoint. I can provide you with direction when I get home.

No crazy opinion pieces please.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you actually read that article you will understand that the Democrats did indeed give up their overtly racist policies.

But you will also read that the Republicans did not switch and become racists or support racist policies to win over racist Democrat voters. The so called Southern Strategy is spelled out in a Lee Atwater interview in which he stated that the GOP could appeal to Dixiecrat voters by use of economic arguments and NOT by means of crying "n*gger n*gger". 

http://www.redstate.com/2012/07/11/the-southern-strategy-myth-and-the-lost-majority/

People often misinterpret the Southern Strategy as a point when the GOP switched and became supporters of overt racism. This incorrect belief  has been proven wrong by use of demographic data that show that the migration of Southern Democrat voters to the GOP was not a sudden movement as the result of the civil rights movement. The migration was a slow and steady movement over 4 decades. 

One only has to ask why ANY political party would embrace racism as policy. Such a move would ensure defeat in national elections. The percentage of voters who vote based on racism is astronomically small. The percentage of voters who would be offended by such policies is well into the majority. Logic dictates that no such policy would be followed by any major party.     </TEXT>

There is a schism in the GOP between establishment RINOs like McCain, Christie, Romney and true Conservatives like Cruz, Walker, etc. During the previous election, the establishment element made up all of the GOP frontrunners so I supported none of them.

Liberals live in a community based reality. They base their "facts" on ideology. A fact is only a fact if it passes through ideological scrutiny. I laugh at your faith based religion. hahaha  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The facts of the case is that the IRS paid heightened scrutiny towards conservative non profit groups than liberal non profit groups. This heightened scrutiny was at the orders of the Obama administration. 

Liberals such as yourself approve of this practice. I will laugh at you when you complain when president Walker instructs the IRS to deny the non profit status of liberal non profits.
