Most agencies have their own guidelines and format that you can follow.  My experience is not recent, however, so I'm not sure where the RFPs (request for proposals) are posted these days.  Contact the agency that might cover the area you are interested in developing.  Ask them! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Zion is about 3 hrs out of Las Vegas.  The Zions Narrows is an 18 mile hike down the river.  While I've walked a ways up the river, the full hike is on my short list.  It is beautiful there.  They only allow so many people in the canyon however, so you need to make arrangements first with the Park. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> After a few years, I decided to get serious, and I got to be pretty good.  I practiced with set shots including spot shots, draw and follow.  The other key for me was to be able to see through three shots, so I played a lot of three-ball just trying to make three shots in a row.  If you can continually make three shots, you can run out. </TEXT>
