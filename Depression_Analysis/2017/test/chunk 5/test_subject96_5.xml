	<TEXT> Gotham is a show with some serious issues. I keep feeling that there's a very good to great show hiding just beneath the surface, but right now it's a bit of a mess. 

Be forewarned, there are people who hate the show with a white hot, inchoate rage. The comment section over at the AV Club is filled with these types. I get the idea that they're angry because they want an actual Batman TV show and they're getting this instead.

I find it to be an enjoyable hour of television for what it is.  Sean Pertwee is great as Alfred and the rest of the cast is decent to very good, for the most part. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> One of things that really bugs me about this season is the sloppiness, inconsistency and continuity issues. I mean, which firm's e-mails did the hackers get again. When Alicia and Will exchanged those sexy e-mails, they were working for Lockhart Gardner, which is a completely different entity than Florick Agos/Florick, Lockhart   Agos.

Anyway, It's established early on that Prady and Alicia are both Dems. In S06E09 we have the DINO (Democrat In Name Only) spot. 

In a heavily Democratic area like Cook County, the Democratic Primary is essentially the election, but you still have to have an election. You can't say that the winner is the SA-elect.

Moreover, if the election that was potentially spoiled was the Democratic Primary, there's no way that the Dems could have lost a seat in the state legislature if there was a recount. 

Nothing from this whole SA plot makes any sense at all. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am amortizing the cost of the battery over the amount of energy it could reasonably be expected to produce. How you intend to use the battery is irrelevant. If you have an issue with my calculations, I'd be interested to hear it. 

As for your calculations, the numbers you're using are way low. To disconnect from the grid you'd probably need at least two, probably three batteries to account for days with low or no sun. Even assuming you do the install yourself, which wouldn't be allowed by Tesla at this point, you haven't even added in the cost of an inverter to your package.

Unless you really want to get off the grid for some reason, grid connected solar with net metering and energy buyback from your electric company makes a lot more economic sense at this point than buying a $3000 battery. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Your numbers don't make any sense at all. 

First, let's forget about the 10kWh unit for now. As noted [here](http://www.teslamotors.com/presskit/teslaenergy?via=newsletter source=CSAMedition), the 10kWh unit is for backup applications with weekly cycling. The 7kWh is designed for the daily use we're talking about. 

So, it's $3,000 for the 7kWh unit.  We have a ten year warranty. 10 * 365.25 * 7=25567.5 kWh. That's 11.7 cents per kWh just for the battery.

But wait, how much juice can we get out of that unit every day? 7kWh? No way, unless we repeal the laws of physics.  Tesla states the battery has 92% round trip efficiency. 92% of 7 is 6.44. Then we have to factor in the losses in the inverter. A typical inverter is about 95% efficient. We now have 6.12 kWh or 22346 kWh. 13.4 cents per kWh.

Can we use all that 6.12 kWh every day? Probably not. Cycling a battery down to 0% charge every day is going to kill it way before its time, unless Musk has invented some kind of super new battery. Let's be generous and say we can use 90% of the power every day without damaging the battery. 5.5 kWh per day or 20111 kWh over the battery life. 14.9 cents per kWh.

That's nearly fifteen cents a kWh just for the battery.  That's roughly what grid power costs in a lot of places.  And remember we're not even calculating the cost of the inverter or installation, which is going to be several thousand dollars on top of that.  Plus, I haven't even attempted to calculate the loss of charge capacity over time, which is significant.

In most states, an adult having sex with a 14 year old is a serious felony that results in serious jail time because someone that age is not mature enough to consent to sex.

Yet when we enter the criminal justice realm, we're ready to lock someone away for the rest of their natural life because of a decision they made when they were 14. To me, that's morally wrong. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I graduated high school in 1984, so picking a favorite 80's movie for me is particularly difficult.

I'd have to call it a tie between Empire Strikes Back and Ferris Bueller's Day Off.

Oh, and there's no way I'm clicking though ten pages for an 80's movie list, so I didn't bother reading the linked article.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Just FYI, this isn't my photo or my house . It was forwarded to me by a FOAF. 

Here's a bit of explanation:

The tenant decided, completely on his own, to attempt installation of a french drain. In doing so, from what I understand based on the adjustor's conversation with me, he took a backhoe and basically unearthed the entire foundation. That made the foundation not have any footing, and voila. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think the answer is that we need to take direct control of economic decisions away from computers. Computers should be able to calculate, analyze and advise, but only a human being should be able to buy or sell.

I don't know how we'd do this. The implementation would almost certainly be difficult, perhaps impossible. But if we don't, we'll be living in a world where the economy is increasingly dominated by algorithmic decision making and the ultimate result is not going to be good for humanity. </TEXT>
