	<TEXT> The film was apparently way over budget and was completely edited and re-shot at the behest of the studio. The original film had Keanu Reeves in a smaller role and Hirouki Sanada being the main character. Did you notice how the [poster for the film had that tatted up guy holding a gun over the shoulder?](http://cdn.screenrant.com/wp-content/uploads/47-ronin-freak-poster.jpg) Yeah he's in the film for about 10 seconds, the original director was locked out of the editing room after the reshoots were completed. It's a shame because I think the film has glimpses of awesomeness and fantastic world building but ultimately it was corporate greed that most likely got in the way of a potentially great film.  </TEXT>

Basically it's a huge sandbox universe in which the stories that happen in the game are basically player created.

	<TEXT> A completely CG animated film would be quite expensive. Look at Final Fantasy Spirits Within, that was completely animated and cost a boatload of money and performed very poorly at box office and basically undid Squaresoft and forcer them to merge and become Square Enix. Now this was back in 2001, so maybe CGI has gotten cheaper to produce but I think the investment is still too much compared to that of a live action film. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So do you guys think that a main entry AC game will ever be set in a  future setting. Navigating a busy metropolis or perhaps a very futuristic city. It kind of seems like Watch Dogs was more of the present setting with Chicago but I think a good AC game can be made if they set it in the future. Picture a city like [Coruscant](http://img2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20080610031227/starwars/images/5/5c/Coruscant_at_night.jpg) from Star Wars and sneaking into a super tall skyscraper to take out your target.

	<TEXT>  Just adding my 2 cents on the topic of Borderlands' sense of humor. The very topical, reference-based, irreverent, self-deprecating, over-the-top style is definitely NOT for everyone. For my money (and personal sense of humor), Borderlands is the most genuinely funny game series in existence. I think it's funnier than most 'funny' shows and movies. Absolutely brilliant writing, IMHO. You can tell that the team at Gearbox LOVES games- there is just fan service after fan service littered throughout

Yeah they love games so much that they just outsource the ones they don't want to make to other teams and pretend it wasn't their fault.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I quite liked the film as I really enjoy these corporate conspiracy types of films. The cinematography is truly amazing as well. Great wide shots of buildings and architecture to make the corporate world truly look imposing. All in all I felt it was film that may have been overlooked when it came out.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> [Better quality of how it looked in film](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLy7wZeqa4) I think the F35 actually looks quite good in the film, especially when it hovers in under the overpass to block the truck. It looks quite real in that situation, not that it would ever happen but at least they went to the effort of making it look real with the model instead of using CG. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Kind of what I was expecting, still picking the game up regardless. It seems like a game someone is either going to love or hate, much like Alien Isolation. I think that's fine in my opinion as the game is aiming to capture a specific audience of car lovers rather than appeal to the more open world type of racer that's quite common these last few years.  </TEXT>
