	<TEXT> Had to share an office with our Food Service Officer, an O2.  He would sit for hours quietly staring at the same 2 pages from the NAVSUP-486 and no, he was not sleeping.  He went to a conference with our Chief.  He took a run in his dress socks that morning because he forgot his regular socks then showed up at the conference with no socks on.   Chief had to sit behind him where his lack of socks was clearing visible to everyone.  

At least once a week Chief would come into our office and tell me to take a break.  I'd always grab my smokes because I knew he'd be in there balling him out for a while.

The worst for me was when he changed into his whites in a small closet that was behind a partition on the other side of my desk.  In all fairness he did ask if this was okay.  He then tells me while he's changing that he accidentally wore dark underwear and would just have to go without!       </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This has become standard and I don't know why.  Telephones are inherently intrusive.  You aren't asking to be called and you have no obligation to identify yourself when you receive a phone call.  Back in the day, all callers would identify themselves first.  Me, "Hello".  Them, "I'm so and so from/with so and so, may I speak with so and so?" or informally, "it's me Jan".  You never got a call from anyone that asked you to identify yourself first!  Awkward call example.....

*Ring*  Answers the phone, "Hello".  Caller, "Hello, who is this?".  Me, "Who are you trying to call?".  Caller, "I'm trying to reach so and so".

Even more ridiculous examples are,  Me,"Hello".  Caller, "Is this so and so?".  Me, "Who's calling please?"   

The bottom line is that calling someone is no different then knocking on someone's front door.  It's polite and moreover safe to identify yourself first than ask for the person behind the door to identify themselves.     </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My mother and by extension, my unemployed, mooching brother and uncle that lived with her used the overdraft option to make what essentially were loans that eventually cost me 6000% of the original overdraft fee.

  I couldn't just transfer money into her account because it was so overdrawn.  I had to send the money Western Union that collected up to 25%. They played this game when I was still in the military and far enough away that they knew I'd still send money home in order to help my mother.  Not the banks fault at all! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Never add flour directly into a simmering or boiling liquid.  Sorry sean_incali.  It's guaranteed to form clumps and won't properly thicken.  

You can either coat the beef cubes with flour before you brown them which essentially produces a roux (preferred and will produce a nice crust) or you can bullf* k it, as we called it in the Navy, by making a beurre manie, which is simply equal parts butter to flour that is mixed well then added by the spoonful.   

The thickening ratio depends on how much liquid you use but generally it's 10 to 1, liquid to roux or beurre manie.  So, if you use ten cups of stock then you will need 1 cup of roux or BM.  Cornstarch is different. 1 oz of cornstarch + 1 oz water will thicken 16 oz or 2 cups of liquid.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If Christians were to follow the true teachings of Jesus then they would have to turn their backs on their own families as he and his own followers did.  They wouldn't hesitate to break up families and leave them destitute as the apostles that had wives and children.  They would shun all gainful employment and any material ownership. 

If you have a problem with this I'd be more than willing to debate you both philosophically or by verse but the later could become problematic. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> First off, congratulations on your promotion!  

Pasta is generally boiled in heavily salted water because it usually contains no salt.  If it's made in-house and salt is already added then you can skip it.  

If I'm blanching vegetables for a crudites platter I will add some salt but not "like the sea".  If I'm doing it to set the color or turgidity and then using the veg in another preparation I won't use any salt.  

I've never heard that salted water affects the absorption rate but even if it did it would be negligible.  

On a side note, there are some vegetables that I will directly put salt on to pull the water out such as thinly sliced cabbage for a wilted but crunchy coleslaw or slices of eggplant before I fry them.  

For the time being do whatever your chef tells you to do.  

In the meantime it may help to study food science in order to understand the "whys" of cooking.  Understanding the basic chemistry involved will help tremendously; from saving a broken Hollandaise sauce, making pancakes without baking powder or preventing the blueberries from turning green.  It will make you an infinitely better chef!  Harold McGee has written several great books on the subject.  

Sounds like you already have good instincts and aren't afraid to question the "wisdom" of so-called chefs.  Just make sure that if you do that you do it respectfully and have the goods to back it up!   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I read the article then read all the comments below then laughed my ass off! 

The comparisons to teamwork in the military and and being able to anticipate and communicate ("behind you!, knife!, hot pan!) in a civi kitchen are spot on.  The military has it's own culture and nomenclature and so does a kitchen.  There is a smooth and rhythmic order to small kitchens that is hard to define along with all the chaotic disruptions that invariably happen. 

  I liken it to a dance and when everyone knows and hears the same notes and all the instruments are ready then beautiful songs happen.  

When you refer to your small station in a kitchen as a battle station, I can relate.   

You see, I'm the real deal.  I was a Navy cook/caterer/chef for Admirals/Generals for 18 years on both ships and aircraft.  I'm also a veteran of several civilian restaurants before, during and after my military career.  

A Battle Station is not much different then a cooking station.  Mine was in a small room called a Battle Dressing Station.  Although my rate was a cook I knew where everything was and was trained to use it.  We always kept it clean and stocked!

As far as being on your feet for 12 hours, try doing it in Combat boots instead of Crocs.

There is nothing in the civilian restaurant world that compares to cooking in a cramped Navy galley.  The Junior Officer that happens to be your clueless Food Service Officer that insists that the fryer be used for french fries for lunch during high speed turns at sea and your just trying best to stay vertical or the CO that expects the galley to feed 250 people in one hour right after battle stations even though all the cooks were at their battle stations and not in the galley!  

Military cooks do it under fire and sometimes we fire back.  Civilians cooks, however, are probably the closest I've seen to military "brothers in arms".

 If you're reading or asking this then you can look up why milk came to be pasteurized in the first place but I'm guessing you are either too lazy or are a troll.  

Pasteurization saved millions of lives and disease in the 20th century when refrigeration wasn't widely available.  Good luck with the raw milk or cheese ; )     </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The best I can do is surmise how to recreate it so here goes.

Make some yeast-raised donut or enriched sweet dough.  Fry until golden and let drain.  Brown some ground beef making sure you break it up into very small pieces.  Add a cheese sauce and whatever other seasoning or ingredients you want.  Let cool slightly.  Using a pastry bag with a long but big enough tip, pipe the mixture into the donut like you would do for a jelly donuts.   Brush top with butter or some sort of glaze, maybe honey mustard and sprinkle with chopped cooked bacon.  

Unfortunately for my cholesterol level, I'll be trying this myself!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Seasoning mixes of all kinds.  Taco, Creole/Cajun, Italian, Chinese 5 spice, Garam Marsala and curry powder all come to mind.  Convenient yes but also awful and more often than not, overly loaded with salt and/or sugar.  Even seasoned salt is better made from scratch.  

Some individual ingredients in these mixes are so much better if they are freshly toasted or ground and for some recipes, certain spices should be added at different times in the preparation process.

	<TEXT> When my great-aunt moved into a new apartment she found what she thought was a patch of dill weed growing nearby and made a batch of pickles with it.  

When I came to visit her she proudly asked us to try her new batch.  OMG!  

"What is this!", I said after spitting it out in the trash.  After showing us the patch of 'dill weed' she found we quickly determined it was a type of licorice plant.  

I can honestly confirm that Licorice Pickles will never, ever become a trend.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Cheese on french fries is pretty common across the States.  There are variations such as Irish Nachos, cheese over thick-cut potato chips or Frito Pie, cheese and chili over Frito corn chips.  Doing the same with gravy, not a variation. 

You couldn't cover tortilla chips in gravy and get away with calling it Nachos.    Poutine; however, is a different dish altogether and a mighty tasty one at that!  

With that said,  what's with the burnt onions?  Yuck! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've been stationed in San Diego and Philly (Willow Grove) so I've definitely eaten my fair share of authentic cheesesteaks.  The closest authentic cheesesteak I found near San Diego was a place called McGonagle's in National City, CA.  They even have the cheezwiz version if you into that but I prefer provolone.    Owners are originally from Philly and their buns are flown in from Amoroso's bakery in Philly.  As close to Pat's or Geno's as your gonna get.  You should drop by and try one before making it from scratch! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That sounds interesting.  Let me know how it turns out.  I would recommend a lighter wine than the Cab I used even with this recipe.  I made it again with a Rose and it was much better and since it had a lighter color I placed some thinly sliced apples on top of the cheesecake in a nice pattern before I added the wine gelee.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Recipe for cheesecake:

Ingredients

    Nonstick vegetable spray
    1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese, divided use
    1/2 pound bacon, cooked, drained, and crumbled (reserve 2 Tablespoons of fat)
    1 onion, diced
    2 apples, peeled, cored, and diced
    2 cloves garlic, minced
    Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
    32 ounces (4 large blocks) cream cheese, at room temperature
    5 eggs
    3 Tablespoons wine vinegar
    1/4 cup whiskey
    12 ounces blue cheese, crumbled
    2 Tablespoons minced chives
    Sliced fresh apples, toast wedges, and/or assorted cocktail crackers

    Prep Time: 20 minutes
    Cook Time: 495 minutes

Preparation

Preheat oven to 200 F. Coat a 9-inch springform pan with vegetable oil spray. Dust with 2 tablespoons of the Parmesan cheese. Set aside.

Saute onion in bacon fat until softened and translucent. Add apples and garlic and continue to saute over medium heat an additional 2 to 3 minutes until apples begin to soften. Remove from heat and season with salt and pepper. Let cool.

Beat the cream cheese in a large bowl until smooth. Add eggs, wine vinegar, and whiskey, beating until smooth. Stir in apple mixture, bacon, blue cheese, remaining Parmesan cheese, and chives by hand.

Pour batter into prepared pan and place in the preheated oven. Let bake overnight for 8 to 9 hours (timing is not critical). It should be fairly firm and slightly browned. Remove from oven and cool on a rack at least 1 hour.

Cover the top of the cooled cheesecake with plastic wrap. Place an inverted plate over the top, turn it over, and remove the pan. Refrigerate the upside-down cheesecake at least 1 hour. Reinvert the cheesecake and remove plastic wrap. Cover and refrigerate 1 hour.

To serve as an appetizer, cut slices with a knife dipped in warm water and garnish with fresh apple slices, toast wedges, and/or cocktail crackers of choice.

Yield: 10 to 12 servings

Recipe for wine gelee:

 To make one 6-inch cheesecake:  Unmold the cheesecake and wrap it in a parchment-paper collar that extends 1 inch above the surface; secure with tape. Pour 1/2 cup of one of the wines into a bowl; if using ros or Pinot Noir, add 1 tablespoon of sugar. Microwave at high power for about 30 seconds, or until the sugar is dissolved. In a small bowl, sprinkle 1 1/2 teaspoons of gelatin over 1 1/2 tablespoons of water and let soften. Heat at high power for 15 seconds, or until the gelatin is melted. Add it to the wine and let stand until slightly thickened but not set, about 10 minutes. Pour the wine gele over the cheesecake and refrigerate for about 1 hour, or until set. Remove the paper collar before serving.

	<TEXT> Flank steak is also referred to here as a London Broil LOL!  It's very lean and requires a cooking method usually involving braising if cooking it whole or cutting very thin strips across the grain with a quick saute as in fajitas. Skirt steak or top round could be a substitute.  

You could use pork belly but it has a lot more fat so I would brown it off first to render some of the fat away and then braise or slow cook it. Good luck and thanks for the laugh!   </TEXT>
