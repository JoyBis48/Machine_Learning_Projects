	<TEXT> I'm not really whining about it just explaining a possible explanation. Yes other countries get shat on, the US just happens to be the biggest target with lots of skewed perceptions which are easily mocked(fat, loud, proud bible thumpers), as well as it's cultural (and geographic) isolation from the rest of the world (American football, imperial system, military expenditures/incursions, healthcare system, tipping, not showing sales tax in the price, ez cheeze, etc.).

On top of all that, it's been the preeminent world super power for the past 70 years. The USSR was close militarily during the Cold War(really a wash because of nuclear arsenals, though with conventional weapons it lagged behind), although it lacked the economy to ultimately compete;  China is currently even economically (or a little bit stronger) but lacks the military projection that allows the US to dictate a lot of policy they wouldn't otherwise have the capability to pull off.

So you've got all these factors rolled into one country that's honestly just a big, easy, slow moving target for global mockery. It can get tired,  and it's like, we're exempt from sympathy because "we're like the rich white guys complaining about persecution".

The best part? When I respond in kind I'm just an ignorant, boorish American.

Oh well, I guess it's the price you've got to pay for your country's disproportionate influence on global affairs since the end of WWII. </TEXT>

Sometimes you have to educate people with wrong views (me in this case), otherwise we're just a constantly divided people fighting over our respective borders and their contents.

I actually like Scotland and have never met a bad person from there, but sometimes when you're drunk and you're challenged on your aggressive drunk comments, you double down instead of correctly accepting your mistakes. 

So here I am, apologizing for the comment I made about your country and countrymen and hoping that we can bury the hatchet in the name of friendship. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is a funny comment because I simply believe that we are different, and get frustrated that the way we do things is considered the "wrong" way. I don't think either system is inherently superior, they boil down to a divergence of extremely trivial cultural developments.

I've never said "not tipping is so STUPID how are you supposed to get good service if the server doesn't have the incentive of a nice tip" nor "including taxes in the sticker price of goods can create a misunderstanding and dissonance between the actual value of goods and their taxed rate".

Meanwhile I responded to a comment saying that "the system of tipping *is* bad, and an established living wage salary without tipping is a superior system", and "america is backwards for not including taxes on their sticker prices".

I was drunk and feisty in my responses, granted. However, even if I was exhibiting the dunning-kruger effect, how were you not? </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  but some things like alcohol, cigarettes, and gas have an additional tax in some counties or cities. 

These taxes are different than sales tax (they're 'vice taxes') and are already added to the price.

For instance, NYC has a very high cigarette tax but the sticker price reflects that from the get go.

Sounds like a solution to your problem?

"Sales tax vary"

Wahhhh, spend 3 fucking minutes of your trip planning on learning the sales tax of the states you'll be in. Americans get grilled for not being educated towards visited countries and yet we have to deal with this bull shit. 

Fucking god damnit it's not complicated. Fucking Australians are such shit for brains. I can deal with Brits lording over us but fucking Australians? Y'all are the Arkansas of the Anglo world. Honestly Scottish people make y'all look like New Zealanders.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm extremely empathetic towards suicide and persons who see no answer but it, but suicide can definitely be a 'selfish' act. I can honestly only speak for myself but dealing with depression, accepting it and so forth, the contemplation comes when you have narrowed your field of vision to such a sliver that honestly all you can think about is yourself. "Where do *I* fit in? Who am *I* really? Am *I* really worth it?

That's the thing I think, it's not selfish in the traditional sense of 'taking an extra slice of pizza when there's not enough to go around' but in the 'wow I'm so miserably self absorbed right now'.

But then seeing it first hand and it's reverberation through the person's family and friends; no matter how low I feel, how insignificant and inconsequential, no matter how inward and introspectively down I get,  I can always count on the sudden burst of 3rd person awareness that takes
Me out of me and allows me to not be selfish. 

It's a fucking battle, between you and yourself, where a part
of you that wants to die and it's selfish enough to try to drag the whole with it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What an awful year for Mr. McNair. 2-10 and a battle with cancer. Glad to hear his health outlook is sunny, hopefully his team follows suit.

Outside of Kraft, there aren't many owners as generous nor humble as McNair. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> *puts on milking frock*

Actually, tipping a cow causes it's utters to plug themselves due to gravity and general cow stuff, greatly decreasing it's milk output. Though fun, this is not an effective way to milk a cow. </TEXT>

Actually, they have both. Most rodeos are attached to livestock shows, of which cows are a big part, with the best ones often out earning the top bull riders for their owners. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Maybe they've updated it since my last use. Regardless, I didn't switch to exclusively uber/lyft because it's a worse service. 

And yes you could enter the address but I was saying that the address service wouldn't be able to find a lot of the addresses I was using. 

And from one anecdote to the other, I constantly had drivers try to swindle cash over card. Sorry bud, you're required by law to have a working credit card machine. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> HailCab was nicer than calling for a cab but the app pales in comparison to its lyft uber counterparts. It's location service was unreliable and often wouldn't be able to find the address you entered. Compare this to uber/lyft which utilizes GPS (or you can manually enter an address) and you are automatically paired with a driver which you can see in real time in the app. Also I found that every time id ask to pay with a card on hailacab, the driver would claim I put cash even when of show them my confirmation ticket.

It's just a superior service in every way.

Source: I use(d) lyft/uber and yellow cab 4-5 times a week.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> God I fucking ***LOVED*** Von Wafer. Went so far as to name my indoor soccer team 'Von Wafer'. He came in after T-Mac went down and just fucking balled so hard.

That team had so much fucking swag it made swaggy p look like just regular p. Artest, Scola, Lowry, Wafer, Hayes, Yao, LANDRY, Fucking DEKE!, Battier.

Honestly think if T-Mac was healthy, Deke didn't end have a career ending playoff injury, and Yao was healthy (though he finished the series with the Lakers) they would have gone to the finals. Shoot I think even with just a healthy Deke in the Lakers series we could have pulled off the upset (took them to 7).

That team and the 22-win streak team the year before have a very special spot on my heart. What made me grow to truly love basketball as a fan. </TEXT>
