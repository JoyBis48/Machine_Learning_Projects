	<TEXT> Again there's no winning, there are dead children on both sides.

It is unforgivable regardless of who does it or why it is done.

The idea that one side is more at fault than the other after all these years only prolongs the conflict and increases the number of dead.

Grief isn't ameliorated because a tally of corpses can be tilted to one side or another - it is just unbearable, radicalising grief. </TEXT>

There's no 'winning' just blood, guts, misery   grief.

	<TEXT> A better negotiation position is never going to be a bad idea. Hamas' election wasn't going to be a welcome development but it was entirely predictable.

Hamas being elected is a revenge vote, not entirely unheard of in Israeli politics either - or anywhere else for that matter.

Furthering settlements will further the appeal of Hamas and their ilk.

Guerilla warfare is insidious and does not need a 'nation state' to support it.

If Hamas is to be stopped, then their supporters need to be given a better solution. Nobody voted for the IRA in NI, they voted for Sinn Fin - the political wing associated with the IRA but not the IRA. A debate still continues about how much hair-splitting that actually was but it was enough to keep the ball rolling to peace.

It's not a fast process, the 'Troubles' in NI were decades long.

Margaret Thatcher signing the Anglo-Irish agreement wasn't something her manifesto suggested when she came to power but it happened.

Yet afterwards was no picnic at all - there were still bombs and horrific violence. Nonetheless without it, there wouldn't have been grounds to find a more lasting solution.

It's a bunch of people who know the final jigsaw picture, but not sure of where the pieces they hold go. Yet they don't give up, because they want their grandchildren to have better lives. </TEXT>

It may not be the best comparison, but it's not so wide of the mark either. Plus, religion was used as a proxy for territorial disputes which I reckon brings the comparison closer. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> All of what you said is completely valid, and it's all happened before. If it was going to work it would have worked by now.

It's time to try something new, overdue really - nobody is feeling safer.

Hamas are lunatics, shooting stone-throwing kids at a border is also lunacy. There's no gain in any of these tactics on either side.

If the idea is that one side should 'win', both sides will lose something.

What international investors will decide on the region if they think their business will blow up or that they must pick one over the other while risking retaliation from the side they didn't pick.

It's not going to be remotely easy, but both sides vote for people to fix this not prolong it. The begrudgery won't end for years, but as the NI process has shown peace needs to come first - the pointing fingers can come later.

An Israel and a Palestine that can live together will be a much stronger force in the region than one that wants to destroy each other. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think the only answer is negotiation.

It seemed intractable and pointless in NI, but endless grieving is much worse than making elected reps sit at the table for years if necessary.

Plus, the current solution in NI didn't involve border changes - but a real assessment of the damage caused to both sides by both sides.

The 'who is at fault' argument has lost its usefulness. Let the next generation be a bit less used, and a bit more educated.

Bit by bit progress, not blow by blow status quo.

	<TEXT> This man is a menace to Irish society.

First he picks Greyhound for refuse collection against the advice of **all** Dublin City Councils.
Greyhound have their registration in the Isle of Man with its more generous tax options, as well as a laundry list of court cases against them.

The Isle of Man is, coincidentally, also home to a number of pension and investment funds that specialise in Refuse   Recycling. Pension   Investment funds being more focused on end results (profits) than working conditions, living wages etc. for any company in their portfolios.

Surprise, surprise - here we are a little later with 30% payroll cuts being mooted for Greyhound employees who have now gone on strike as a result. Is Greyhound part of an investment portfolio? I don't know - but it sure looks like it.

Then Irish Water and its mystery charges which were meant to be detailed this week, after several other 'deadlines' have been missed. He infamously stated that he didn't know all the costs involved or why Irish water was spending so much money on consultants. Though simultaneously insisted that his department knew all the costs involved.

The free allowance for Children is also to be cut apparently, but we don't know those details either.

Let's not forget his commitment to reducing quangos and increasing transparency in county council spending - only to then shelve the report on it and, naturally, create a new quango instead.

The man is not remotely true to his word, his actions have had consequences that range from the frankly suspicious to the stunningly callous.

It also worth noting that in his declaration of interests to the Dil he has **no** assets, apart from a gifted membership of the K Club. No house in his name, no investments of any kind. Or in other words, someone who could be very easily persuaded by a tempting bribe (assuming the declaration to be honest).

	<TEXT> Well, project Morpheus will be great for games just like the Oculus Rift will but of course that's not the only thing VR can be good for.

Something like 'Second Life' with a VR interface seems like a logical next step and potentially a VR killer-app, but Sony are unlikely to get or ask for detailed Second Life data. The solution, they made their own.

Ok, Home was a bit more basic but it still had plenty of valid data points they could analyse: PSN ID data, movement through Home-space itself, spending habits if any, network congestions in a shared 3D world and even simple collision data (very handy to know for VR to avoid nausea).

Home got such derision and sneering it was hard to see why Sony kept at it, unless it provided useful data for some other purpose. My guess is that that purpose is shared with Project Morpheus.

Someone or some company is eventually going to make the first commercial   global 'baby Matrix' and I think Sony want to be in with the best chance they can.

I don't think Facebook bought Oculus just because they could - they want FB users to 'walk' via Facebook   Oculus through a global VR world.

I think Sony have been giving a 'baby Matrix' more thought and work than Facebook: e.g. PS Move, 3D in general and Morpheus itself.

That task would be much better with actual 3D world usage data. It just looked like Home so none of us really noticed.

It reminds me of debate over the Hydrogen fuel-cell car or the Electric Battery car - both have their plus points. But one already has infrastructure in every house in the country, so I'm guessing we'll end up with the other, Hydrogen, because lobbying.

	<TEXT> I think this says more about E3 than No Man's Sky. 

Many AAA ~~games~~ publishers seem to follow Hollywood (teasers, trailers, reveals ...
) rather than capitalising on games' unique opportunities with a Hollywood flair.
 
The AAA scene is hamster-wheeling on pre/se-quels. 

So I'm waiting till games reach the bargain-bin as there's no rush to play re-skinned games anyway. Though these days that means little against pre-order sales.

I hope No Man's Sky is great and maybe it becomes the 'Forbidden Planet' of sci-fi gaming.

Yet for every 'reveal' of any game I see - I think of one of the first reddit comments I read:

	<TEXT> Using my amateur insect sleuthing, I reckon they are 'springtails' which like damp:

Get rid of the damp and they'll go elsewhere as they need moisture to survive, and hoovering them up seems to be the best starting point. They don't like thyme oil or clove oil either apparently. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I got out of a fine because of this type of messing.

Got 80 fine, went to local Garda station told "you can't pay that here, go to the Post Office".

I went to the Post Office, and it wouldn't scan in - the barcode fading more each time a scan was attempted. Then the number was typed in manually, but the system glitched as it had partially processed one of the supposedly failed scans.

Nothing more to do in the Post Office, I went back to the Garda and explained and they said a new fixed fine notice would be sent out.

Then a new notice to say the fine had gone up because I hadn't paid the first one. I called to explain what had happened and yes a new notice would be sent.

Never happened.

The Garda I talked to didn't give a shit. </TEXT>
