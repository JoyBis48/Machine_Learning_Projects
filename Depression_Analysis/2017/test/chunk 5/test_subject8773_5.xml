	<TEXT> Thanks for doing this contest! This is my boyfriend's favorite movie, and the movie we watched together when we had our first kiss :) So here is my [inspiration.](http://i.imgur.com/8HHM6g5.jpg) :) 

I figured that since it was a romantic scene, I would do a romantic look. My phone's camera sucks, so you cant really see how vibrant the colors are, but I loved the amount of color and life in the movie, especially the oranges and blues and purples. [Here's mah face.](http://imgur.com/a/VW05s) Hope you enjoy!

	<TEXT> I LOVE MA FACE!!

Here are my[ pictures!](http://imgur.com/a/9qWZy#WKGXawB)

First off, I have a scar (that's barely noticeable anymore) on my nose. I got it in Kindergarten when I had the chicken pox. I ran into a wall face first and it scraped off! I love telling that story. I used to hate it because it was a little deeper back when I was young but I think its cute now. 

Second, it might be hard to see but I have three beauty marks on my face. They're close to my hairline on my temple and the third is higher up on my forehead.

Third I have just one dimple! I like this because I never discovered this until I took some senior photos when I was 17. I hardly have any pictures of me actually smiling because I used to be very self conscious about my teeth.

Fourth, my teeth. I always hated them until I got to college. I never wanted to smile with my teeth. My parents couldn't afford braces and so I never got the front two fixed. But now I appreciate that it makes me unique. My boyfriend always tells me I have a cute smile and so I had to put this in here, because I know he will see this. Love you!

Fifth, and lastly, my nose. I used to despise it because of the chicken pox scar and because of how wide it is, but I have learned to embrace it. People never believe me when I tell them that I am part African American from my mother's side. I am proud to be black, and the only features I have to show for it are my dark eyes, darker skin tone, and my nose. The other parts of me, French, German, Irish, and Native American, have definitely managed to shine through as well, haha. 

Hmm. I would say I'm special because I care about everyone and try to help everyone with everything, even if I can see that sometimes they're taking advantage of me. A little kindness goes a long way, I say.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not to give any discredit to the piercer, but she seemed to be in quite a hurry when she did it. I came in and already knew that I wanted a horseshoe. She just picked a size, pierced me, gave me some directions on how to clean and sent me on my way. I was so excited and it all happened so fast that I didn't even realize that she didn't tell me what size mine is :( and now I'm not even in Eau Claire anymore, so I have to go to the place I usually go and try and have that place size it. 

I wish I could help you out more!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh goodness. If I had to pick one it would be Rimmel's Stay Matte Primer. I have pretty dang oily skin, so it really helps with that. It feels kind of thick going on, but it tones down the oiliness and helps me maintain a dewy finish. It's probably one of my favorite finds because I had searched for months for a good primer and I finally found it. Also, Clump Crusher. I can't live without it, and I can't find a mascara I like more. Another one would have to be Revlon's Colorstay Matte Balms, because they are so easy to apply and I can't be bothered some days to whip out my lipstick and my lipstick brush and try to perfectly line my lips and all of that.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So, I kind of broke a rule (oops) as I've posted before without doing an intro. /u/blanksy was kind enough to remind me in chat that I needed to do one!

Anywho, I just wanted to say that I love this subreddit, and love the idea of having contests and being able to commit random acts of kindness within the context of makeup. This subreddit is so supportive and kind. I reaallllly love makeup and have a growing collection. My friends think I'm crazy obsessed, but they don't mind so much when they need someone to do their makeup, haha. I've only recently had the ability to start feeding into my hobby more in terms of finances and RAoM really makes me feel like I have a home and a comfortable place to showcase what I have learned over the years. Thanks for that!

My other hobbies include singing, reading, and listening to music. I also study Spanish so if anyone here speaks Spanish or is also learning we can practice together. I think that's it! Keep being fabulous! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would say that my biggest thing about doing makeup on other people is that I might have to adjust some things according to who I am putting the look on, even if I'm trying to achieve the same thing for several different people. This is especially true for different eye types. 

When I do makeup on other people, I realized the thing that gave me the most trouble is doing their liner, especially wings, which I have a feeling you are going to be making use of. On yourself, it is much easier to close your eyelid or start from the inner corner or the middle and draw the wing out that way. I suggest that you have them look straight on at you, and you draw the wing first, so that you can draw a wing that is appropriate for the type of eye they have, otherwise it could look a bit cartoonish or just flat-out ridiculous. 

Also, I would say if you have someone with hooded eyes, you might want to search a couple youtube tutorials about maximizing their lid space. I have friends with hooded eyes who feel that eyeshadow is a lost cause on them when it really doesn't have to be that way! One important thing I always try to remember is to make sure that if you do anything sparkly or dramatic on someone with a hooded eye, you should try to put whatever crease color you are using (if youre using one) a little bit above their actual natural socket, because otherwise the shadow gets lost. 

If you would like a little bit of advice about different eye shapes, [this eye shape video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9bdkpypZKElist=UUCvoAe__WFYMNAEN-C-CtYA)
 is very helpful because he provides examples of celebrities with those different shapes. He also just did [a smokey eye tutorial for hooded eyes](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tq3EB4NepKYlist=UUCvoAe__WFYMNAEN-C-CtYA) which you might also want to take a look at.

Hope this helps a little! Have fun!

	<TEXT> Thank you! I used Clean and Clear Morning Burst moisturizer, Rimmel's Stay Matte Primer (which really gives me more of a dewy look because I have oily skin) and Maybelline's FitMe liquid foundation in the shade 120. I apply the foundation with a stippling brush, which gives me more of a smooth finish! I also used a little bit of blush that's a really generic, cheap brand that I don't even remember the name of anymore, haha. The primer is awesome...its really thick and I find it fills my pores and keeps my makeup from slipping around all at the same time. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks so much! I actually use Elf's Cream liner in Black and an angled brush to apply. I used to use liquid, but I find I like the more matte look of the cream better :) </TEXT>
