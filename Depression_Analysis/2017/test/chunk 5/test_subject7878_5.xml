	<TEXT> If one dresses, speaks, and acts a certain way, they are labeled as such in my mind.

In my city (Baton Rouge, LA; but New Orleans is worse), GENERALLY SPEAKING, blacks are lazy, low-work-ethic, governmental-freeloaders who do nothing but leech off the system while not contributing.  If they DO get jobs, they're on their damn cellphones or talking to each other rather than assisting the customers.

We rarely go out-of-book, because all of our priests have cared about participation. We sing to minister, not to perform. They are a congregation, not an audience.

I've been to other churches, and I know exactly what you mean. </TEXT>
