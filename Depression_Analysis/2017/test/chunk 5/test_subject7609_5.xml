The book also received a Kirkus starred review,  which is fairly hard to achieve ( https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/josh-malerman/bird-box-malerman/), so maybe the one with bad taste is you?  </TEXT>

With the new changes, they removed a primary motivator for many people to pay this game - going infinite. They already added casual draft, does this game need to cater to casual players 100 percent of the time? Nobody would be complaining if they left the competitive tournament queue payouts the same with all of the other positive changes.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What a totally asinine, biased, and uninformed view about M:TG. As a former player who has played the game for about 15 years, about half of which competitively, here's where you're off base.

 Magic players have no problem spending $200~ on a deck that will only see around 4 months of play (due to newer sets coming out, making your older cards no longer legal). This, to me, is insane. You can, of course, make a deck much cheaper. With that said, it is unlikely you will find any success unless you use more expensive, rarer cards.

Sort of true, but very, very, misleading. Yes, top tier standard decks cost upward of 200 dollars, but it's not like players are just dropping 200 bucks every four months, the way you make it seem. Magic is an investment over time. Each set stays in Standard for two years. Due to different popular formats (modern, legacy) and casual formats (commander), the chase rares of a set will hold a good portion of their value once they rotate out of standard. Trading/Lending is also a huge part of Magic culture. It can be expensive to start from go from nothing to having a top tier deck, but this is not the path 95% of players take.

The most expensive formats are the ones that use nearly all the cards. Needless to say, decks can cost $1,000s. Here is a link to a popular card in these types of decks. Do you see the price? That's a legitimate $200 for one card. Decks that play this creature want to run the maximum 4 copies. That means, if you want to use this card in your deck, you're likely spending $800 to do so. That's just 4 cards out of your 60 card deck. It's insane.

Again, wrong. The players that play these formats are experienced ones who have built their collection over time, have at least a couple years of experience, and have either opened these cards years ago, traded for them, borrowed etc. These formats are not run nearly as often as standard, so when they take place at a large scale, cards are heavily borrowed within the community, which is pretty tightly knit. No one just drops a thousand dollars on a deck like it's nothing.

As a final note, many players ignore the cost of their decks by claiming that the value in their cards is not lost. Tarmogoyf, as shown before, is a $200 card. When you play with it, it's still $200, and you'll be able to use its value to potentially sell for your money back when your "done" or trade it away for more cards. It is painfully clear that you will never get your money back on any of these cards. Only the historic rares, like the Black Lotus, ever exchange hands for meaningful money. Players will only ever offer you more cards, and stores will undercut you severely. Your money is lost forever within every card you purchase.

Wrong again! Here's a link to an completed ebay listings of Tarmogoyfs - http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40 _sacat=0 _nkw=tarmogoyf LH_Complete=1 rt=nc As you can see, they're mostly selling for $150 each. Like anything else, you will not get 100% of listed value, but to say that you will never sell them? Wrong wrong wrong.

If everyone in the world decided that Magic: The Gathering was an amazing game, and we all wanted to play it, we couldn't. This is because there are not enough copies of the cards for all of us. Tarmogoyf isn't just expensive because he's a popular card. He's also expensive because there aren't enough copies of him for everyone. Proxies are illegal in all sanctioned tournaments, which means that most MTG fans will never get to play in formats where Tarmogoyf is legal.

That's why Standard and limited exist - the cards are readily available. It's hard to find smaller weekly tournaments that *aren't* standard or limited, so to the regular player, this shouldn't affect him at all.

I don't know what it is about card game communities, but it seems to attract some of the oddest. Are the people pictured "good people?" Maybe, but most won't want the association. Other geek hobbies seem to have grown mainstream. Comic-Con is filled with beautiful people in costumes. Call of Duty is something the average-Joe plays on weekends with his buds. Magic: The Gathering, and other card games, have "Crack Gate". In my year of playing MTG, the majority of **the people I met were either children, college-drop-outs, drug addicts, mentally-unstable, or any combination of the former**. In the same way Sonic attracts a "strange" crowd, card games do as well. There's a lot of fun you can have playing these games, and merit in interacting with these people, but I cannot blame anyone who would refuse to do so.
Of course, people of all walks of life play these games, just as all sorts of people do anything. I mean no disrespect to any particular person or people.

Really dude, could you be more insulting and condescending? You're posting on a forum about video games, you really feel like you're above these people? You really think cosplayers and people that go to cons are totally free of weird people? Yeah, there are different people that play Magic, but there are weird people that do everything, especially of the nerd persuasion. There are obviously bad seeds, but most of the people you meet are genuinely nice people and wouldn't bat an eye to help out a new player. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi, I just checked out this game last night, but have lots of tcg experience (mtg for 15+ years, most competitive, solforge, hearthstone, etc. ..).

I am looking to play this game without spending money. Is it viable? In other online ccgs, it is possible to build nearly everything you need over time, while playing limited to build your collection. Can i do that here? Are there daily rewards? Can i join tournaments and buy legendaries without platinum, which seems like a bought currency? 

Would definitely appreciate advice from other F2Pers, or just be told that this is not the game for me. Thanks! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You can't grind out a collection in this game. It's either pay, or amass one for free over time.

There are daily rewards for login, 1 online win, 1 win, and 3 wins. Every win will also net you 100 silver, which is not nearly enough to be worth grinding. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The problem is Stoneblade's to fix. It is not an unsolvable problem. Other games either circumvent this toxic behavior through timers, or punish repeat offenders by banning them from the game.

It's pretty clear Stoneblade has no intention of dealing with this behavior, so expect plenty of 15+ minute waits in between games in the draft queue. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Popular YA lit isn't representative of all current writing. If you like Vonnegut, try *Tigerman* by Nick Harkaway. Orwell, try *The Curfew* by Jesse Ball. Bukowski? try *Person* by Sam Pink, or *Black Cloud* by Juliet Escoria. Try reading Denis Johnson, Atwood, Tartt, DeLilo, Adichie, Murakami, DFW.

Stay open minded. You won't like everything you read, but if you aren't afraid to try something new, you aren't going to branch out and will miss out on a ton of great reading.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> how to go about preseason? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-10-15 16:33:05 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> new player here, feel like I understand most of the game so far, but not sure on how preseason works.

Is there a point to loading up my roster with 80 guys, and keeping my sure starters off of the preseason depth chart? 

I understand that rankings only change at the end of the season on paper, but fluctuate throughout the season under the hood. Do the player rankings for young rookies/guys trying to make the team vary wildly enough that I should be heavily evaluating preseason play?

Or is the point just to keep starters from getting injured?

Thanks! </TEXT>

What's next after Crystal Eaters? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm aware. I've been playing the deck since crafting for killion opened, and it's just not very good. It has a lot of bad draws, especially if you are playing first. Many games you just get smashed in PL1 and your leveling is worthless because you lost the game before making it to PL2. The deck also loses to random trash like sporelord.

The deck is capable of coming in second, sure, but it is not tier 1. That's results oriented thinking. There is a reason is showing up less and less.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Uterra is still the best by a lot. Alloyin seems like it's the worst, and my preferences are generally U/N - U/T - U/A - T/N - A/T. 

I'm sure plenty of people love A/T, but it just doesn't work for me. The citadel wall deck is good if you get the cards, but if you whiff on citadels or the 7/2 guy, your deck just sucks and you end up 1-3. Alloyin doesn't have many great tricks like it used to with matrix warden, and even strategist feels unimpressive compared to cards in other factions.

Lysian Shard, batterhide, the new 3/6 consistent guy, and dysian siphon are all obviously nuts and gamebreakers. Seal is still great and usually a first pick but it isn't the play it at all costs card it used to be. 

Highly prioritize nearly any good consistent card, any of the good one shot cards (siphon, hound, burnout), and the rank 2 cycle. </TEXT>

Recommending *The Third Bear*, a short story collection that is Vandermeer's best work in my opinion. </TEXT>
