	<TEXT> "We remove what we're required to remove by law" is CYA-speech meaning "we'll do the bare minimum to make sure we don't get sued or arrested." Clearly reddit has a ton of other subreddits that host very illegal content, and their continual survival means that the admins don't think it's worth their time to actively look for these things unless there's a hint of trouble. They could just be honest and say "we don't have the manpower to monitor everything", but they clearly went the moral rationalization route about free speech and self-governance. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The worse problem is the efficiency at which the fappening and its spawned subreddits were removed, but while other subreddits that link to clearly illegal shit remain online. As administrators they have access to absolutely everything on the site -- does that mean they actively don't remove illegal content until the public catches it? If the answer is yes then the site should just admit that all they are doing is CYA bullshit instead of claiming to have actual free speech principles. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There are plenty of things on reddit that are clearly very illegal, but the admins don't do anything to remove them. You could argue "but nobody sent in a complaint!". Reddit could easily and probably do have a program to monitor for questionable content/content to remove (how else could they remove all fappening subreddits so quickly?) but they actively choose not to apply it to other things. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What you are basically saying and other admins on reddit have said are that the only types of content that will ever be removed from reddit are (a) ones that violate copyright, (b) child pornography, and (c) personally identifiable information. Everything else is a total free-for-all.

This is the disconnect that you have with large swaths of the reddit community. Not only are those three categories occupy such a narrow range of topics, but yishan's earlier post suggests that the discussion is more or less closed on how reddit censors content. Also, these three categories are also conveniently ones that will get you in trouble with litigation or law enforcement, which makes it seem like a total CYA move.

Please, try to understand this perspective from the community's point of view. If you are going to actively censor content, you have to do it in a less tone-deaf fashion. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It will only boost recruitment if they think they can win. People have survival instincts.

Case in point: long after FARC became anything representative of an agrarian militia and turned to kidnapping and drug smuggling, the Colombian government needed some way to neuter them. The Washington Post had a great article about how they worked with the US government to wiretap every single call coming out of purported FARC locations. Every spot was GPS and intelligence confirmed, which was followed by a American gigantic smart bomb locked for use for only that site. Immediately after were actual Colombian forces which would clean up the area.

After a few years of this FARC in shambles and bankrupt, so they had no choice but to negotiate. The same can be done with ISIS, but it requires years of solid work to strangle them of members and money. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> See the other post on this thread. Roughly they do about a third on "non-overhead" expenses, which is actually not that terrible for many charities. People like to focus on the high overhead, but the thing is that as organizations get bigger and your "direct spending" from fundraising goes up, the overhead accordingly balloons. It's unavoidable.

Here's another thought for those who are harping about research. Universities take a huge chunk of money from grants too. They also call it "overhead". It varies by University, but most of them take anywhere from 30-50% of a grant that comes in. For most grant programs, this is listed as either $X in direct costs (meaning excluding overhead and the extra is basically invisible to the application), or is lumped into a total sum (meaning the actual money the researcher sees will be a fraction of it).

Overhead is basically the "cost of admission" for a lot of big organizations. Sure, it seems ridiculous, but I can't think of many nonprofits who do such wide-ranging work and with such huge spending on research and services and have razor thin overheads. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Actually, this can also be applied to the Israel/Gaza conflict. Israel feels like they can airstrike them with virtually no impunity, and Hamas feels like that if they only have a 1% chance of sending a missile through then that means they have to send even more missiles. They're expensive to make, so if the Iron Dome didn't work they certainly wouldn't be sending in 15 at a time. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> On the flip side, there are bacteria known to accelerate tumorigenesis! H. pylori is one that many people know about for gastric cancer, but there's been a lot of work showing that Fusobacterium nucleatum, an oral commensal but an opportunistic pathogen, can invade the colon and accelerate the growth of these tumors. What's really crazy is that this bacteria can literally invade cells and cause disregulation of cancer pathways. There was a paper a few years back where they were able to find genomic sequence belonging to this bacterium in *metastatic* sites. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It really depends on your field. In a lot of cases, if you are not going into academia taking six or more years for a PhD will put you behind in terms of on-the-job experience as compared to someone of equivalent age. You could apply to senior scientist positions and you will have a very good background, but you will also be competing with people who know what it's like to be in industry (eg. patents, navigating a team, etc.). 

Some industries absolutely require a PhD for higher level research (eg. biotech and chemistry), but many positions in computer science it might set you back unless you plan on doing research. I would say that if you got a PhD in Physics and went into industry doing quantitative modeling in a completely unrelated field, you would for sure be at a disadvantage compared to others who are applying for the same position. </TEXT>

Combat troops in the Middle East has become such a politicized issue, and many people on both sides of the political spectrum immediately take maximalist positions: even one soldier or one bomb is too many. There is a very big opportunity here for the US to help the Kurds. Of course, it will help if the Iraqi citizen saw that they were being rescued by fellow Iraqi/Kurds, but the US can do plenty in terms of providing logistic support and supplies. Honestly, in a conflict of this scale I'm surprised that the US hasn't been supplying the Kurds since Day 1. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> - When you apply, the understanding is that the university will cover your tuition and stipend. It's very rare that this isn't the case and I've heard of no PhD student in the sciences who have had to pay anything out of pocket (Masters is another matter). In most departments you are expected to TA one or two semesters, but past your first year your PI will pay for you through his own grants. With regards to applying for fellowships, you are applying to graduate school fellowships in your own name. Your PI may also get you to contribute towards his or her grant proposals, which will provide funding for your stipend as well as research money. With regards to the PI funding you: you need to make sure that you are joining a lab with stable funding and that the professor is likely to be tenured if they are junior faculty.

- You should mention the specific professors in mind by name. You won't offend anyone -- in your application letter you need to talk about your research interests and this should naturally lead to some faculty at the department who will be doing something related.

- Letters of recommendation are your bread and butter, because aside from your grades there is nothing else for reviewers to judge. The applications start in the fall until December, so you need to get them lined up. You should be very aggressive in hounding professors. One of my recommenders was the head of a project course that I was part of. As long as they are in an authoritative position at the university and can speak for your laboratory efforts I think that is fair game for graduate school.

- You are definitely at a disadvantage if you are lacking in hard research experience, and your grades and letters will have to make up the difference. If you are feeling unsure I'd suggest working in a lab for a year.

- A side note, with regards to where you should apply: when I was applying for graduate school, my grades were just OK but I had a ton of research experience. I applied to a lot of schools ranging the entire gamut in terms of prestige. In the end I was rejected by virtually all of the schools except for the top tier ones. In my case (as well as for you), it is likely that middle tier schools are operating on training grants that have restrictions on who they can take in (ie. American citizens) as well as labs themselves having less funding. The top tier schools, however, have a lot more money and therefore can take in a much more diverse crowd. Keep that in mind when you are applying. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Canadian who got PhD in the states and doing a postdoc in the states too. Knew a lot of people from the UK who went to grad school in the US.

Some major differences:

- The PhD programs are way longer than in the UK. You can be in and out in the UK in 3 years. However, especially in biology this is not enough time to get papers for a good postdc so advantage USA. The problem is that because your stipend and tuition is being funded by your PI, he/she has no real incentive to let you graduate if you are productive. Similarly if a lab is well funded, they might "take a risk" and let you work on a long project that doesn't pan out for eight years or more! In the UK you have a lot of independence but that can range widely with American labs.

- With regards to independence, you are expected to apply for fellowships to support your funding. Many labs don't have this strict requirement, but keep in mind that you'll be spending a lot of time in your first year or two writing fellowship applications. Many of them are only applicable to Americans/Green Card holders, so you should make a list ahead of time and figure out which ones you can apply to. The ones where international people can apply to are EXTREMELY competitive, so make sure you have a polished application and the best letters of reference.

- In your statement of intent for the application, it's generally accepted that you should identify a few labs that you are interested in. However, for many schools (especially in biology PhD programs), you are not taken up immediately by any particular lab on day 1. You will typically do "rotations" around different labs to see where you will be a good fit. However, it's expected that you identify a few interesting PIs in your letter (and explain why! Read their papers!) to show that you've done some research on the school instead of just copy and pasting different applications.

- With regards to LORs, you will need to explain to your recommenders that they will have to write a "you can walk on water" letter for you. It's part of the culture, and if they can't write you one like that then you shouldn't have them writing one and drop them from your application. There is nothing worse than a lukewarm recommendation. Your recommenders should anyway be well-versed in American science to know what's necessary.

- Lab experience: I started my PhD program not too long ago (2006), and at that point it was expected that you go straight from undergrad into a PhD program and there was the expectation that you got your research experience in tandem with your undergrad education. Nowadays I see a lot more people take a year or two off to work in a lab and publish a paper, and it doesn't appear to be hurting their chances (in fact, it only helps if you have a paper). This might be a route that you want to take, especially since it will lead to a good letter of recommendation for graduate school and you will gain a lot of research experience without being thrown into the deep end on Day 1 of graduate school rotations. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't know if that's a fair argument though. One of the really attractive things about solar and wind are that despite its low output, you don't really have to do much once it's up. You basically get the energy "for free" from the sun. Nuclear energy still requires mining, enrichment, and building the plants themselves (I'm pro-nuclear, though). There were a lot of studies done that said although nuclear energy has a huge output, the sheer dollar amount of safety infrastructure, regulations, and bureaucracy makes it not that much more efficient.

You also have interesting advantages with solar/wind, such as decentralization of the power grid and the ability to deploy in remote/rural areas. You can easily deliver power to BFE without building extensive power lines, which is really attractive for interior USA.
