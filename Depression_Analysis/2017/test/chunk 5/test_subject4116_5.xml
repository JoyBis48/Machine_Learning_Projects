	<TEXT> This is part two. [365 Days.](http://www.reddit.com/r/cryosleep/comments/2r5p41/365_days/)

I left shortly after midnight, following the last patrol rolled away down the street. 

I'd have left earlier, but the Ives family had thrown a part rather, they were told to host one. Social interaction is good for us -- good for our morale. Everyone on the block was forced to go, and for whatever reason, the duration of the party was set for over four hours. I did my best to act cheery, but as my watch beeped past 10:00 and 11:00, I started getting nervous. It would take all night to reach the farm on foot, and my absence would definitely be detected first thing in the morning.

Finally released to go back home, I gathered up a few belongings (a change of clothes, bottles of water and an old watch with the location tracking abilities removed) and set off through the brush and trees in my backyard.

The trees soon gave way to abandoned roads and houses growing more and more sparse before falling off altogether. Huge swathes of planted farms stretched to the horizon in every direction, some taller than me. I'd been there a few times before, early on when I'd considered running away. It was how I'd met Jeff. He found me laying in the dirt, staring up at the moon.

The moon. There are people up there, still. Free, independent humans. The last broadcast that I saw from them touted the resilience of man, but we all knew that there weren't enough resources on the rock to make it worth it for the bugs. The bases aren't even visible from Earth, after all, but just knowing that they're up there -- that maybe, just *maybe*, there's someplace left to run to...

The farms are automated now, and run from a central cement bunker where Jeff monitors the motion sensors. It's hard to tell the difference between a person and an animal based on motion alone, but Jeff has gotten very good at detecting patterns and regularities. If something heads in a straight line for too long, he jumps in an old pickup truck and checks it out. 

He doesn't mind me going into the fields. He's all alone most of the time, so he actually appreciates the company. In his book I'm crazy for risking it, though. I convinced him to let me stay at the farm until the sun sets again, then I'll continue on to the city. He's got some food stored -- something I wasn't able to do myself, what with them only portioning enough for one day at a time.

The sun was up by the time I reached the bunker. It was shining off of the old pickup's windshield, and casting a long shadow on the dirt beside Jeff. He was waiting outside.

Something wasn't right.

He shouldn't have been outside. Suddenly, I felt extremely small and vulnerable. Somewhere, hundreds of sets of eyes were scanning screens of satellite images looking for me. The clock was ticking. And yet, I couldn't silence the alarm bells ringing in my mind. Jeff's eyes were sweeping the field.

From the entrance of the bunker marched a bug, its six legs shuffling carefully along the loose gravel. The tops of its shoulders were level with the farmer's. Without hesitation, its jaws clamped around his neck, snipping the spinal nerves and dropping his torso like a puppet with cut strings.

I ran through the corn. Something was following after me, something large and fast. I turned. It sped past, taking a few seconds to realize that I'd changed direction. The ground dropped out from under me, pitching me face first into a mud-walled drainage ditch full of water.

I surfaced. Through a mask of mud, my eyes took in the silhouette of the stalks shaking and falling as the bug stomped back and forth. In my mind I replayed the vision of blood spraying from Jeff's throat. I sank into the water, and let it carry me slowly and quietly downstream.

The stream took me more-or-less in the right direction, though all my clothes are soaked and freezing. I should be able to reach the city tonight... if I'm not caught first.

The important thing is that I got out. It can be done. 

Today, I lived as a free man. One day taken back of the year that they stole from me.

	<TEXT> 365 days... I dont even think that most of the others have kept count this long. For them, they hit this routine and switched their brains right off. Our extraterrestrial masters couldnt have been happier about it.

Every day as a part of their system, I go to the store for breakfast. Theyve picked out my food for the day, and packed it into a paper bag. Enough food for one day, nutritious and bland. My house is at the end of a cul-de-sac, and so I was placed in line behind the rest of my neighbors. After checkout, were seated at the tables for exactly 30 minutes. It doesnt matter if I eat all of it, or nothing. I have to sit in place for the full 30 minutes while the news plays from my watch. I can close my eyes, or look the other way, but I *cannot* stand up.

Being the last to sit down means that Im also the last to leave. This is why, for whatever reason, I have to miss the bus. Every day. The times are wrong. Ive filed the appropriate paperwork 365 times now, and yet nothing has changed. Its not humanly possible to move fast enough to catch that damn vehicle.

Every day, standing outside, watching the bus rolling away on its magnetic tracks, I can feel one of them -- feel it in my ears. Their insect-like clicks and pops resonate inside my head like flicking a plastic ping pong ball with the back of a fingernail.

I cant tell them apart. All their exoshells look the same, so I dont know if its the same creature that comes to punish me every day, or whether they rotate them. The thing rears back and wraps four of its arms around me, the thousands sharp fibers that look like hair pierce through my clothes and glide along my skin. Locked in a sort of bear hug, it then administers the disciplinary shock.

When people were still getting adjusted to the routine, I saw an old man step out of line at the store. He wanted a soda, I think, or a magazine. He might have been wearing a pacemaker, and the electricity killed him. When released, his face was twisted in pain, a silent scream hanging on his lips. The next day, the hologram of his face hovered above my oatmeal.

It occurs to me that tomorrow my own face will be on the holograms, either because I escaped or because they have killed me.

I just want them to know that not everyone has forgotten the way that it used to be. Goodbye.

	<TEXT> Reddit self posts are in something called Markdown. It's pretty simple once you get the hang of it, but it tends to eat the stuff you copy/paste from Word.

The common mistakes are:

* Don't include tab/indents at the beginning of paragraphs.
* Double tap the space bar at the end of a line before returning to the next line, or skip a line by hitting enter twice. If you only return once, it won't show up.

	<TEXT> 1. Disregard the sidebar.
2. Ignore things like common courtesy and community.
3. Write 600 words while sitting around in your underwear and eating fruit loops. Now, your story is the best story of all the stories. There is no reason that even you can't be bothered to read it again to check for mistakes. It couldn't be better, you may as well not even try.
4. Now that your story has flopped, take the fight to the OOC. Remember rule #2, and keep in mind that it really is all their fault.


(Optional) 

1. If your story doesn't flop, make sure to go to the OOC and hit them up for money. Any post over 100 points means that you've got their panties fucking dripping. Give yourself reddit gold, so that people can see how much everyone liked it.
2. Start a Kickstarter, an IndieGoGo, an OKCupid, an Ebay store, set out little tin cans on the sidewalk. Set the stakes high, and don't take no for an answer. Repost weekly.
3. Be vague about what you'll actually use the money for, like hiring an "agent" and an "editor." Make sure that you've already had someone "edit" it for free, so that that the money you raise can go straight into your pocket. 
4. Show them that what you're raising the money for is already done/being done (badly) at no cost by posting it directly to the kickstarter. Nosleep's a bad bitch, and sometimes she likes a good slap in the face like that.

Repeat as desired.

And remember: never fall in love with writing. Take the first opportunity you can to quit writing and start promoting yourself. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The first time I visited Pittsburgh, I forgot to bring any cash. Not that this is a big deal these days. Most places will take a card, but not this one.

On the outside, I thought it was a coffee shop. The sign read: *Strange Place*, next to a hand-painted picture of a steaming cup. I entered hoping to sate my caffeine addiction.

Instantly, I realized that it was a bar. Someone had spelled their beer across the hardwood floor near the entrance. I felt my feet sliding and smelled it before my eyes adjusted to the dim light. I suppose at that point, I should have just walked out and found an actual coffee shop. I could feel the people staring at me, though. An outsider, intruding into their private establishment. A small, person curled over a mop bucket, tapped his foot waiting for me to exit the puddle I was standing in. To save face, I resolved to stay for one drink.

The bartender's face was horribly scarred. Normally, I try not to stare at things like that. I mean, I know that it's rude, but I just couldn't stop myself from taking it in. It looked like someone had dunked the bottom half of his head in a vat of acid, and the skin was now dripping off. As he turned to face me, the sagging fold waved gently.

"Christ. Are you going to drink something, or just stand there staring all night?" he asked me. I realized he'd been talking to me before, though I hadn't seen his mouth moving. I couldn't *find* his mouth.

I ordered a draught beer. He poured it first into a large mug, and then plopped it up on the table with a solid thunk.

"Three bucks."

I fumbled around for my card. When I extended it out to him, now trying to make eye contact like a respectful human being.

"Cash only," he said and pointed to a stained brown and yellow sign held to the wall with packing tape."

"Oh. Sorry, I don't have any... Um, do you have an ATM?"

"You can put it on my tab," came another voice from down the bar, smooth as velvet.

I smiled at the generous stranger and thanked him. He smiled back, revealing long, stained teeth. His incisors were filed sharp as daggers, and hung down over his lower lips. How he had avoided injuring himself was beyond me.

"Huh-uh." The words came from behind me. The man with the mop, still standing near the door was staring at us. Only it wasn't the same man. This one was younger, standing up straight and muscular. "Ye'll not make another mess in 'ere, ye bloody buggah."

Feeling awkward at being in the center of the conflict, and confused over the reason for it, I turned to see how the man with the peculiar body modifications would respond... only to find that he was no longer there, and that the bar was empty. I'm sure I heard his clothes rustle as he got up, like a flutter of leathery wings, but couldn't see where he'd gotten off to.

"*No* messes, Martin?" A seductive woman's voice, coming from the even darker tables further into the bar. "Not even just. one. little one?" Slender fingers counted the buttons up my shirt in rhythm with her words.

The man rolled his eyes and went back to mopping.

"Hi there. I don't think I've seen you before in here."

"No, yeah, I'm just visiting."

She was beautiful, but there was something not right about her. I couldn't figure out what, though, since my eyes were falling down the neckline of her dress. Somewhere, I heard soft music beginning to play, a clean, clear voice singing.

Her hands were gliding across my shoulders, lighting up the tender nerve endings in the skin of my neck, grasping my cheeks. She pulled me in for a kiss. That was when I saw her ears. The ends were pointed. I stopped myself, but her fingernails dug in behind my cheekbones. Her tongue flitted across my lips... a long, forked tongue, like a snake.

I don't remember how I got out, only that I nearly stumbled in front of a car. The music slowly faded from inside my head over the next few hours.

Tomorrow, I'm going back to Pittsburgh. This time I'm bringing a camera.

Most of the series that have ever gotten more than 100 votes are linked there, and the staff lists whether they're complete or not. They also make recommendations on some of the best to start reading. 

Also, if you're looking to get started writing, but want some help and feedback before jumping into nosleep, check out /r/nosleepworkshops. Just remember, too, that the average writer for nosleep isn't a writer at all, they're just people with stories to tell. So if you've got one, lay it on us, and maybe I'll let you read my finale. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This isnt a happening-right-now-oh-God-what-should-I-do-help-me-nosleep kind of story. Im 24, and this happened when I got my first apartment at 19 years old.

After spending a year in the college dorms, I thought that living on my own would be a relaxing change. Instead of constant fights between roommates and parties dragging on into the wee hours of the night, Id be left alone in the quiet. My only company would be the old man who owned the downstairs of the house. The whole upstairs belonged to me, an attic converted into a studio apartment.

And things were quiet for a while. The whole first term of school went by unremarkably and some of the damage Id done to my brain cells and my GPA was undone.

For Christmas vacation, I decided to stay in town. Most people left for the Holidays, and being a college down, things pretty well emptied out. Suffice to say, I didnt exactly have a happy home to go back to, nor did I want to take the time off of my part time job.

Instead, I smoked a joint, put a frozen pizza in the oven and put on Netflix.

Alright, it was porn, you got me. When I finished, I closed the browser, but realized that the sound was still on. Even after I restarted my laptop, the sound of a woman moaning continued. Someone was crying, and it was coming from downstairs.

I was curious, and decided to take a look. My web cam had a long cord, and I lowered it out the window. There were other sounds now too, grunting and pounding.

As you can imagine, the idea didnt work very well. I could barely see a dark and out-of-focus shape through the window. A person was standing in the middle of the living room, bending over and standing up again in rhythm with the noses coming up through the floor. They looked like they were dancing or working out, but the noises didnt fit. It was definitely a person crying.

I watched for almost a full minute just to try to understand what was happening. Then the person yelled Help! On the screen, I saw the movements stop, and then she pitched against the ceiling right beneath my bed. The sound scared me so badly that the camera spun on its cable and I lost the view through the window. Id seen enough anyway.

I stood at the door to the stairs. Was it safe to go down? Was I safe if I stayed here? What if whatever was happening downstairs decided to come through the floor and into my apartment? Should I call the police? What would I even tell them? Should I put pants on before I go outside?

The noises had gone away. The ovens timer went off. After taking the pizza out, I sat on my bed and thought about what I should do. My high was still there, and it mixed with the comedown from the adrenaline, and soon I was peacefully asleep. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The title isn't very inviting. It does kind of go along with where the story starts but not where it ends up.

The first paragraph overdoes the narration. Between dialogue looks and facial expression is expressed and analyzed. Keep in mind that the audience is (something like) a group of people around the campfire. The first part of the paragraph doesn't quite flow as well as it would if it were naturally being told.

You couldn't even call what we did breaking in / This made it easy for Connor... to punch the pane into oblivion.

Does that not sound exactly like breaking in?

There are a bunch of places where the language is too big for the story. 

...that human instincts capitulated hesitation. The id seized control of the brain by harshly irregular means...

People just don't talk like that. It's one thing to use uncommon language to say something very specific, but in this case the sentence should be really simple and the language complicates it.

Some of the words aren't really used correctly, either.

uprooting a **hellfire** of dirt and rocks.

But a hellfire is... actually a fire. It just lends to the overall impression that the writer isn't totally interested in the story, but is more focused on writing the words. It's strange, and I find it to be pretty off-putting.

This part:

Hair, hanging downwards. The hopeless battle between wrist and tether. Blood, starkly red and seemingly omnipresent on the slick dirt floor. Groans, sick, thirsty cries hailing from an owner long devoid of hope that they'd ever reach kind ears.

was pretty creepy and well done. To me, that should be the real focus of the piece. The "villain" is then there to serve the fact that the characters weren't supposed to find that.

Overall, the story is there, but the strange wording gets confusing and takes more effort than it's worth to get through. A few run-throughs of editing to cut away the unnecessary stuff are needed. </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2014-12-23 02:13:44 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I can't have children. My husband and I had just come to accept that. We didn't have money for a surrogate or an adoption, and by the time we crawled out from under our loads of debt we'd be too old. It would be irresponsible to try.

Last year on December 15, I got a letter in the mail. I almost threw it away along with the rest of the junk, but something about it... I think it might have actually been the paper. I'm no Patrick Bateman, but the creamy smoothness of the envelope was somehow just *right* in my hand the way that I'd never considered before. It was pleasing. The triple-folded sheet inside was the same way. I laid it out on the counter, smoothing it out by running my hand over its intoxicating surface and studied the words, the stork logo and even the signature on the bottom.

*"A gift,"* I read; the gift of creating a new life, which they would deliver for thousands who thought that conception was impossible.

I did the worst thing I could have done when confronted with that kind of gorgeous promise. I accepted. I called and set an appointment to be seen the next day, then I tucked the letter back into its envelope and stuffed it into the drawer next to our checkbook.

The next morning, my husband left for work and I thought about telling him as I kissed him goodbye. I didn't, though. Some part -- the rational part of me -- was sure that it was too good to be true. Just another ad for just-another clinic that wouldn't accept our just-another-insurance-plan.

The other part drew me on with reckless hope and curiosity. As I got dressed I thought about medical advancements I'd seen in the news that might make this possible. While eating breakfast I wondered what being pregnant would feel like. As I backed out the driveway I pictured what I was going to name her.

By the time I reached the building, my heart was racing with excitement. I hadn't let myself feel anything about children since we found out that I couldn't have them. Maybe I really hadn't realized how much I felt that I needed to become a mother. All of that was bubbling to the surface as I pulled into the parking lot.

The building was beautiful, if out of place. It certainly didn't fit the image that I'd made in my mind. The large center crouched near the top of the hill and looked out over the ocean. Natural light streamed in through dozens of bay windows that faced the water. The sheer white walls and floor seemed to glow from within.

The receptionist welcomed me and as she was checking me in, having me sign papers and fill out forms, I remarked on how beautiful the place was. It struck me that their usual customers must be paying fortunes to come here. She smiled and said that they're told that all the time, but that it was really more than just a doctor's office. The center focused on the "big picture" for both the mother and the child, and that fertilization was only the beginning. Most of the rooms, she said, were for recovery and bonding after the children were delivered.

"It's important to Dr. Bristol that the women we serve have a calming place during the transition of new life."

A nurse in white scrubs like I imagine Dolce and Gabbana might have designed came and led me into the back rooms. She took my vitals in one of the rooms. The natural light and warm feeling continued even deeper inside the building, away from the windows.

"I'll let the doctor know you're ready," she said, her soft, warm hand resting on the door knob. "... And congratulations. This is such a great opportunity for you." She smiled and left.

I wasn't waiting for long before the doctor politely knocked and peeked in through the door. Once again, I was surprised, but this time I was underwhelmed. The doctor was short and frumpily dressed. Here was the I'm-in-a-hospital feeling that had been missing since I'd walked in.

He didn't say hello or even look at me until he'd thoroughly studied my file in the computer through coke bottle glasses. His red, glistening face glowed against the backdrop of the white room.

"Ah," he said finally. "This is fantastic. I have just fantastic news for you. You're going to be able to have children. As a matter of fact, you're just perfect. Just fantastic." He smiled and rubbed his hands. "So, a boy or a girl?"

"Well, I... My husband and I haven't really talked about this, but I'd like a girl, I think."

"Perfect, though we could do a boy too, if you'd prefer that."

"Prefer it? You get to choose?"

"Well, *I* don't, but we allow all our new mothers to choose. It's our whole philosophy here."

The nurse in white knocked and re-entered the room, carrying a tray which she set on the table.

"What is?"

"To eliminate stress from the whole process. Some women we serve have a great deal of stress over those things. Many can't decide, so we end up delivering them twins. So many twins, actually, it's quite fantastic.

"So. Are we ready?"

"Ready?"

"Oh yes, we need to act fast if we're going to be able to get you in."

"I'm sorry, I was under the impression that this was just a screening. The letter said..."

"No no no! Don't stress. This isn't going to cost anything, and the decision is not permanent. If you change your mind at any time, you're more than welcome to come back and we'll help you through it. Does that help? I had hoped that we would be able to serve you today. A girl, you said."

"So, what, it's just a... some kind of treatment that will make me fertile again?"

"Yes, exactly."

"And... it's not going to cost anything?"

"It's my own very personal interest. Each year during the holidays I offer my service free of charge. A gift."

"And say if tomorrow, I talk to my husband and we decide again that we shouldn't have kids... I can just come back?"

"We'll take care of you. Whatever you need."

The whole thing was crazy, but what was there to lose? To gain?

"My husband, though, I mean, what do I say?"

"Say whatever you like... Or say nothing at all. This is your process, it works however you want it to. Exactly the way you want it."

"Sorry, I just... I'm surprised, that's all."

The nurse was offering me a tissue. Tears were streaming down my face, but I couldn't process what they meant. It was all overwhelming at that moment.

"Shall we, then?"

I nodded. The nurse prepared the needle, and Dr. Bristol swabbed the area on my behind with disinfectant. A pinch was all that I felt. I tried not to shake as I held in my sobs of joy.

"All done."

That night I made love to my husband like I hadn't since we were in college. I didn't say a word to him about the clinic or the doctor or the treatment. The moment never seemed right. The last time we'd talked about children was three years ago; did I really even know how he felt about it anymore? Then after the deed, I felt as if I'd lied to him, ambushed him. It would be a surprise, but an innocent one, at least as far as he knew.

The next morning I was sore. My legs were wobbly and my stomach was churning and bloated. From the lack of sleep, my head was foggy. On my way to the shower, I threw up. I felt drunk.

The day after, I felt even worse, and I was hungry *all. the. time.*

The third day is when I noticed that my stomach was sticking out, even more than it had on Thanksgiving. It wasn't just food, but wasn't it early to be getting a bump?

On the fourth day, I called the clinic again. I made it clear that I had to be seen immediately. Something was wrong.

"Don't stress," the receptionist told me. "Just stay calm and come out whenever you can."

---

"It's too late," he told me. "Up to the third day, it's possible to remove the fetuses, but at four, it's hardly doable."

"Fetuses? What are you talking about? They're... they're nothing! I *just* had sex. It isn't enough time to..."

"This is fantastic, really. You're going to make them all so happy."

"Them, who?"

"The new mothers, of course."

"What?"

"Well, they're all waiting."

"What are you talking about? They're *waiting?* Waiting for what?"

"For their children, of course. Your children."

"What? I didn't agree to this."

"On the contrary. I'm quite sure that you signed the release."

"But I -- You said that I could change my mind. I want to change my mind, I'm changing it. This isn't what I thought."

"I'm sorry. It is too late. You should just be happy! Hundreds of women are going to get to know the joys of motherhood because of you."

*"Hundreds?"*

"Oh yes. You see, our method is to fertilize *all* of the eggs at once. One shot. Of course, there are *thousands* of those. After fertilization, we harvest the most desirable according to the wishes of the mother. Through a simple surgery, we transplant them from your uterus into the new mother's. You're a hero, really, you've given them a great gift."

"I don't want to. I just... I can't have children. I can't."

"You can't?"

"I'm infertile. That's what they said -- infertile!"

"I hadn't heard about that, of course. Hm... This does change the dynamics of things. I'm afraid that you may still not be able to have a child of your own."

"So you'll... stop this. This... *thing* inside?"

"It's too late, miss. Those other mothers... promises have been made to them. It wouldn't be fair. It wouldn't be ethical. We need to see you in two days. Please make sure to schedule an appointment on your way out." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Woman gets abducted under the guise of being hired by a Wall Street firm. They keep her locked in a room made to hold women like her so they can use her for sex. When she's no longer desirable, they dispose of her.

The last line tries to touch on the expectations that got her there. It's intentionally a little vague, but her parents basically said that they wouldn't hurt her.  There's a confused sense of "love" or "want" and a misunderstanding of the sinister reasons that the business hired her in the first place. Parents' best intentions vs. real worldly evil. </TEXT>

When I said I'd sue, they laughed. When I fought back, their smiles grew wider. When I was spent, they brought me here and left me to die.

In the particular case that I heard about, he was having trouble finding a match and then found out that people of his race register at a lower rate, which may explain why. [This page](http://bethematch.org/for-patients-and-families/finding-a-donor/hla-matching/) explains that there are "many" HLA markers and how they are inherited. [This one](http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/race-matters-when-a-patient-needs-a-stem-cell-or-marrow-transplant/2013/08/05/51abdf04-f2d9-11e2-ae43-b31dc363c3bf_story.html) claims that donor and recipient require "nearly identical genes" and talks a little bit about the challenges facing asian and black people especially. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I feel like there's more here than what's being told. It's a decent beginning though.

The format is more than a little strange. Is this an official document like a patient chart? Maybe you could do a little research as to what that might actually looks like. Else, E-mail traffic might work, too. I just don't get much sense of what I'm looking at.

The doctors don't seem very confident. Not able to diagnose an infection? Not willing to prescribe specific meds? Not sure that's realistic.

Thanks for sharing, keep it up! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> First off, this part:

 I went to check on her when I noticed something wrong. Her vomit was moving. Crawling. As Mary continued to heave up piles of small squiggly crawling creatures blood began to splatter. First small drops in the sick. Then eventually the blood began to flow heavier. Mary no longer heaved but weakly hacked as the size of the insects crawling out of her mouth grew larger. Coated in blood and sick they came scampering over her now pale and sweaty skin unaware of the destruction they just caused.

is AWESOME. That's where the horror is.

Now, to get to there, you took a strange sort of roundabout way. You start with "My sister Mary loves to travel," implying that she's still alive, and that this is something that she does all the time.

Then the main character is going on a trip with her, and it becomes clear that the story is focusing on this single instance.

After that, it jumps into the future. "Years later, I recently looked into one of those boxes and found Mary's travel journal." I think the story would work better with this part taken out. In the climax you already get to see that the vomit is moving, so it only really lessens the surprise.

Mary dies, in the main character's arms and only *then* does the main character call the hospital.

Then, it just sort of ends. That last line is pretty weak.

Basically, it just needs more **structure**. Some kind of cohesive plan to keep it all together and in order. Even if the events actually happened the way they're said in this, for the purposes of storytelling, just make them streamlined.

* Mary and I went for a trip to Ecuador
* Mary ate strange food and got sick
* She died when bugs crawled out of her stomach
* I never found out what killed her

rather than

* Mary travels a lot
* I went on a trip with her
* Mary ate strange food and got sick
* At the end of the trip, I shoved her things into the closet
* Years later, I pulled the things out of the closet
* Mary had written that she was sick
* Mary was sick, I was there, here's how I know she was sick
* Mary died when bugs crawled out of her stomach
* They never found out what caused it

Good luck! </TEXT>

There's this place I know. It's somewhere down the rabbit hole.  
It's filled with oddities and terror. The knives cut with precision, leave no room for error.  
The people look back with blackened sockets. They bar the door behind them, and then they lock it.  
It's cold and wet, the air is sour. Some might call it hell on earth, but we just call it ours.  
This place is a secret, but you're invited. So won't you join us in this place where earths wrongs are righted? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's on the edge for me. The ambiguity between human and deer (?) definitely makes it creepy. If the end didn't say conclusively one way or the other, I think it might do better. Basically, let the reader decide whether the thing has hooves or not.

I got a nice Jason feel at some parts, though, which was a lot of fun. Good luck! </TEXT>
