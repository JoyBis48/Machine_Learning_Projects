	<TEXT> There are actually some people that can smell pregnancy hormones. 

They know someone is pregnant because they give off a slightly different natural smell. 

I was like that when my ex GF was preggers, I could just "tell" she was pregnant before she even found out. 

Unfortunately, what I was not able to tell was that the child wasn't mine. o3o </TEXT>
