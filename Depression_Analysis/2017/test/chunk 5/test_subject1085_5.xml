	<TEXT> So, I have a book lined out and ideas completed, but I have a horrible time with dialogue. I know the characters and how they are, but when they talk to one another, it seems like a bad movie or a cheesy rom-com. Any suggestions? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In the novel I'm writing, I plan on having the man in love with the main girl, and she kills him in the end. So many would-be da girls would throw their books across the room. I want to break that stereotype. She then goes on to rule the land without a husband or children </TEXT>
