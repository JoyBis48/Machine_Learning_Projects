	<TEXT> Ah, you're also a young one. Shame we've been hit with this so young, right?

My heart rate was in the low 40s as I slept when I was admitted, the food also sucked at mine and I had a mental breakdown at the idea of having 'snacks'. (Though that was mainly because I couldn't hold anything down - still can't, in fact - and felt like I'd be spending 24/7 vomiting or trying to hold back vomit.)

I didn't have to be helped to the bathroom but my dad had to be with me while I showered. And I was supposed to sit in the shower but lol, that wasn't happening. </TEXT>
