if you have netflix and x show is on foxtel you can't stream it without having foxtel as well as netflix.. then you have the other few streaming services which all have an exclusive show

piracy might have lowered a little bit but it will pick up as people don't want to subscribe to 2-3 services just to watch the shows they want </TEXT>

	<TEXT> yep it's easy to find work as a schoolkid at mcdonalds in fact that's the age fast food places generally want because they can pay them less then the older people

you can easily switch to part or full time after school or stay casual if you have uni and make money

it's what i did i saved thousands working 6 years at maccas while studying

my guess is some people quit after they turn 18 because they don't want to work in fast food anymore due to embarrassment or something </TEXT>

any money she received from the family was wisely used instead of been pissed up the wall like most people at that age

I think the reason why people think they cannot buy property is because they want a multi-million dollar house now. Youve got to start somewhere and build it up, she said."

that is actually sound advice.. lots of people are not willing to live far from the city so prices are much higher, the further you move the cheaper it is.. the commute might suck but you'll have a cheap decent home/apartment </TEXT>
