	<TEXT> Note Sauron was without the Ring in LOTR, but was quite the formidable adversary nonetheless, and growing in power. Scuppering the Ring in the ocean would not change anything, he was going pretty gangbusters as it was. If he regained the Ring, well, game over, but the only way to ultimately defeat him was to destroy it in the fires in which it was forged.Also to address other points in thread, there are no other volcanoes mentioned to cast it into. and as Gandalf stated:
But there is no smith's forge in this Shire that could change it at all. Not even the anvils and furnaces of the Dwarves could do that. It has been said that dragon-fire could melt and consume the Rings of Power, but there is not now any dragon left on earth in which the old fire is hot enough; nor was there ever any dragon, not even Ancalagon the Black, who could have harmed the One Ring, the Ruling Ring, for that was made by Sauron himself. There is only one way: to find the Cracks of Doom in the depths of Orodruin, the Fire-mountain, and cast the Ring in there.

As to sending it away:
But Gandalf has revealed to us that we cannot destroy it by any craft that we here possess, said Elrond. And they who dwell beyond the Sea would not receive it: for good or ill it belongs to Middle-earth; it is for us who still dwell here to deal with it.

So you hide it, you lose; you try to send it West, they won't take it; Bombadil will forget and lose it; nobody is immune to its creeping influence. Much as it sux, and given Sauron's rise and the discovery of the Ring, the only solution - despite being ridiculously difficult, was to get that bitch to Mount Doom baby. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's technology-relevant, it will stay in our feed. We don't discriminate either way. Lol you think kids these days should have their information about maybe bad things censored by us? And barbaric? Jebus, do some research mate. Perhaps abrupt, but generally measured in scope and application. What you seem to miss is that it's not a club, just any group anywhere who choose to not name themselves and run around under that name. Bless 'em, if they were nasty I'd ban 'em but frankly they please me and certainly fit our rules where you see them appear. things like [this](http://blogs.mcafee.com/mcafee-labs/new-hacker-groups-take-up-the-anonymous-banner), and [this](http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2011/05/201151917634659824.html), and [this](http://thecolbertreport.cc.com/videos/xjtazd/corporate-hacker-tries-to-take-down-wikileaks) (lol!) and seriously, they are nothing more than modern social activists in the digital sphere. It's like you want us to ban people of colour or women back in the day, no we will not, they're welcome if they fit under the rules voted for by 5  million readers. Welcome to 21C, I don't understand why this even bothers you enough to type so much. Or me to type so much responding for that matter. I must be drunk.. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I love this..really sells the concept!

 Five months later, Lister stared out of the sleeping quarters' viewport window and saw nothing. Just a few, very distant stars, and an awful lot of black. It was pretty much the same view he'd had for the past twenty-one weeks At first he'd found it awe-inspiring Then, slowly, that had given way to just plain dull. Then very dull. Then deeply dull. And now it was something below deeply dull, and even below deeply, hideously dull; a word for which had yet to be devised. It was, he thought, even more mind-numbingly, deeply, hideously dull than an all-nighter at the Scala, watching a twelve-hour season of back-to-back Peter Greenaway movies. If you went to the British Library and changed every word in every single book
 to the word 'dull', and then read out all the books in a boring monotone, you would come pretty close to describing Lister's life on board Red Dwarf. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You reckon he can write a manifesto or put out anthing other than lulzy rants from where he'z currently? Project PM was digging into the shit that nobody took too seriously until the Snowden revelations smashed the doors wide open. He had his foibles, an aristocratic air of snobbery, a penchant for not disagreeing with that he was a mouthpiece for Anon (which doesn't make much sense) but end of day he was an investigative journo who did actually give no fucks in following the story. Was he sloppy? Yes, to his own detriment obviously. And produced nothing? Eh he was a voice sharing what was found. He admits poor skillz, but no point in exposing crime or malfeasance if you have no way to tell anyone about it. So hellz, a FBI shill instigates a raid in a private security company, delivers instructions as to how to pwn them, share linkies with journo in teh loop, he digs into delivered data, fucks up royally online after raids, getz v , faces 100yrz jail for bullshit, and you're gonna complain that he didn't deliver?! Fuckin' 'ell..

Tell y'what, previous generations didn't. Fuck, look at what Nixon got booted out for. A pittance compared to the shit that's exposed and allowed to slide these days, and y'all just roll over and go 'M'kaaay..' Not much shit happens in this country cuz we're small population at teh ends of the earth (worth taking if yer playing Risk but, then sally forth), but for better or for worse in this era the shit you guys do affects us all, as much as the Brits did at one stage, as much as the Romans did at one stage, as much as the Incas did at one stage (time and location dependent). Our laws are getting tightened as a reflection of your laws getting tightened. Not that yer laws are adhered to anyways (national security blanket), just make a workaround from some schmuck to say hey torture ain't torture and yer good. No accountability, and that sux. Weird thing is, I think our prime minister's an asshole, for so many reasons, not least being that he'z an asshole, but i quite like yer prez. But then I step back and realise that what happens there affects here and I only like him cuz he'z less of an asshole than the past few. What kinda compromise is that?! We're in the shit, YOU'RE in the shit, what was once considered American Values is completely compromised. Whistleblowing against abuse of power by elected officials was traditionally not only considered a protected right of the person, but a respected responsibility of the person. Now you get locked in solitary for the rest of yer bloody life. Nope, yer train is off the rails mate.. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So I see. But now I've deleted what I had and any way I approach the extension link (through /r/toolbox sidebar, direct through Chrome Extensions), it just comes up with 'Added to Chrome', but it isn't. This has been happening since you moved from beta. I was assuming it was just updating. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Witch-king's steed had its head lopped off, so unlikely to be flying anywhere. Also:
The crown rolled away with a clang. Eowyn fell forward upon her fallen foe. But Lo! The mantle and hauberk were empty. Shapeless they lay now on the ground, torn and tumbled; and a cry went up into the shuddering air, and faded to a shrill wailing, passing with the wind, a voice bodiless and thin that died, and was swallowed up, and was never heard again in that age of this world.

So no, wasn't him. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Copypasta cuz lazy (or efficient)..

While plastic is usually considered an "artificial" material, it is typically a polymer based on organic petrochemical compounds. Polymers can be described as large molecules made up of simple repeating units. The word polymer is derived from the Greek words poly meaning "many" and mer meaning "part". Many types of polymers can be created by varying the molecular composition of the repeating unit.
Being organically-based, polymers are therefore subject to degradation and breakdown through natural oxidisation. Degradation may be initiated or accelerated by numerous factors including ultraviolet light, visible light, ozone, pollutants, manufacturing impurities, oxygen, and heat. During degradation, oxidisation can result in the breaking and rearranging of chemical bonds along the polymer chain. This can begin even during the manufacturing process, due to the conditions of extreme heat or pressure that may be used to form the polymer.
To delay the onset of degradation as long as possible, both process stabilisers and long-term stabilisers are added to the polymer. The most important primary anti-oxidants used for long-term stabilisation are the sterically hindered phenols. Unfortunately, these exhibit an undesirable side effect when exposed to ultraviolet radiation. They develop deeply coloured molecular structures resulting in irreversible yellowing of the plastic. To minimise this effect, polymers are also provided with an ultra-violet stabilisation package. This package is often made up of ultraviolet absorbers (UVA) and hindered amine light stabilisers (HALS).
UVAs protect physically through molecular absorption of the high-energy fractions of sunlight. The absorption transforms the molecule into an excited state, and when it collapses back to its original state, the absorbed energy is released as a thermal emission (heat).
In contrast, HALS protect chemically by combining with oxygen when exposed to sunlight to form stable nitroxide radicals. These trap the oxidising free radicals released when the polymer is exposed to ultraviolet radiation.
Eventually, the stabilisers are either consumed or migrate to the surface of the polymer where they are abraded away. The polymer has then lost its protection and deterioration proceeds rapidly when exposed to the factors mentioned above.
In theory, after-market protectorant products provide a coating to replace or supplement the original UVAs or HALS in the polymer. They cannot, however, reverse any yellowing which is the result of degradation of the sterically hindered phenols within the polymer itself. </TEXT>
