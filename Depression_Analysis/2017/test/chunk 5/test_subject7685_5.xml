Sounds like your controller was broken mate. I can usually get pretty much a full day of gaming done on one charge, and I don't dim the light bar at all. I guess the amount of vibrating the controller does plays a big part, but since I play GTA Online and Mortal Kombat X the most these days I'd say my controller vibrates a lot.

There's a difference between a dirty driver, and a good driver who's driving dirty. Got any racing crews I should look up?

If I find myself racing someone that seems to be a clean driver I'll try to avoid hitting them. If I do hit them I always slow down for them as a sign that I didn't do it on purpose. Maybe I should look into joining a race crew, never considered that being a thing. I much prefer the racing to things like TDM Capture anyway. </TEXT>

Yeah, because it's the best way they can get people to buy their games on steam since games on steam are so cheap they can't possibly charge full price for it. The market is willing to part with less cash per game than the console market. I guess that's the crux of my argument. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  AC Unity (a flop in many ways) and Far Cry 4 haven't been more than 40% off (35.99) on Steam, for example.

Maybe I was exaggerating a bit, but I'm willing to bet that's still cheaper than they've ever been on consoles when bought brand new.

I once saw a collection of 5 GTA games for something like 30. That blew my mind. I've been told many times that PC games are so cheap on steam they actually offset the massive cost of the hardware, the the point of PC gaming actually being the cheaper option in the long run. That's some cheap games right there. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you don't mind paying 45 quid for console versions, you shouldn't mind paying the same or more for better PC versions.

I disagree. I'm ok with paying 55 (current average price of a new game) on console because I don't have an alternative. If I switched to PC gaming I'd definitely take advantage of the low low prices PC gamers enjoy.

The sales on PSN and XBOX Live pale in comparison to the sales on steam. I don't recall ever hearing a console gamer saying "I have 200 games in my backlog", but it's a relatively common PC gamer quote.

I'm not saying that consoles don't do anything that could potentially harm profit of games such as sales, but that we're constantly being told how much cheaper games are on PC. I'm routinely told that games are so cheap on PC that it offsets the massive cost of the hardware and actually turns out to be the cheaper gaming option in the long run, the game are that much cheaper.

As for used games, I feel this argument is negated by the PC pirating argument. They cancel each other out.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  like Starcraft II, with 6 million units sold, which compares well against Gears of War 3's 6.3 million).

I'm willing to bet that Starcraft II had the benefit of being in steam sales, which are known to knock up to 95% of a game's price off. Compare that to Gears of War 3 where the vast majority of copies sold likely went for full retail price or close to it. While the number of units sold is comparable, the price of each unit sold could possibly vary wildly between the two games.

I'm just speculating here but I bet the 6 million copies of GoW3 made way more money (not including dlc or microtransactions) than starcraft II did. Of course I could be totally wrong. There's a lot of assumptions being made here. I guess the point is, games are way cheaper on PC, and therefore don't make as much money, and therefore don't allow devs to get a bigger budget for the next game as much as console sales do. </TEXT>

I'm not sure what you mean by this. Are you saying they save money because they don't have to put the game on a disc?

More sells in general

There may be more sales on PC but the games are selling for way less than people pay on consoles with all the constant steam sales going on.

Five GTA games for 20? Yeah, console gamers have to pay a little bit more than that. </TEXT>

Finally. Listen up PC Master Retards. I know PC gaming is king, anyone who disagrees is an idiot. But the next time you give us console gamers shit because our systems are "Holding back gaming" and "Necessitating the dumbing down of our precious games" Just remember that a fucking huge chunk of the money given to developers from the sale of their games comes from us console gamers. Those precious steam sales you always brag about, the cheapness of the games you're always boasting about, they're not doing the devs any favours.

So the next time you bitch about console gamers ruining your games, just know that without us you wouldn't have half of them at all.

If only they gave us a good reward for beating the towers, I might bother with them more often. The complete 50 living towers trophy is gonna kill me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As much as I'd like some story DLC I'm glad to see they're not done with GTA Online. I need a reason to go back there since everyone I played with has left and there's not really much else left that I want to buy. I've got 2 mil sat in the bank, just waiting for something spend it on. Over 42 days spent in GTA Online, I've done pretty much everything there is to do in Los Santos many times each, it'll be nice to have a reason to go back there.

Unless the content they're talking about is just more jobs, most of which I'll never play (capture etc etc). Fewer jobs and more missions would be nice. And I mean missions, not just:

1. Go here.
2. Grab this.
3. Take is here.

That's 99% of the missions in GTA Online unfortunately. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  But hundreds of thousands of experiences, if not more, can't ALL be attributed to mental illness or mistake

Yes they can. Of course they can. Why do you think they can't all be explained by natural means? That's like saying 2 billion people can't be wrong. Yes they can! you just made the appeal to popularity logical fallacy.

The number of people believing something has absolutely no bearing on whether or not it's true.



some of those somethings have been captured on photographs and video

And yet not a single one has been confirmed. Not a single account of anything supernatural in the history of mankind has ever been confirmed as being true. That's why the default position on supernatural occurrences is to not believe it until it's been demonstrated to be true, which is why I don't believe, because every single claim of the supernatural has failed to meet it's burden of proof. 

 It would be better to assume it exists and try to quantify it, than to assume it doesn't and ignore it

But people aren't ignoring it. People are doing real scientific tests (and have been forever) to see if such things exist. People will always test for those things. BUT UNTIL THERE'S A GOOD REASON TO BELIEVE THEY EXIST THE DEFAULT POSITION IS TO NOT BELIEVE A CLAIM. Sorry for shouting but that's the most important part. There is no good reason (word of mouth is not a good reason) to believe ghosts exist. People are looking for them, they will continue to look, but they've found nothing.

If ghosts were even half confirmed it would be the biggest news in the history of mankind. Make no mistake, people are looking, but they've found nothing so far. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So I'm fighting... some tower. the last one in the Kove looking portion of the map. Was it really too much to ask for them to label these things? Regardless.

I'm on fight 4/6, and it's cheap IMO. Firstly I'm forced to use a card I don't own. This annoys me because it messes up the equal levelling I used to go for in Injustice, but I can live with that. The trouble is Cassie's passive. It claims "All Spec Ops teammates have a 25% chance of unblockable attacks." And she's teamed with 2 Spec Ops cards. I don't believe the 25% part at all. In my experience 3 out of 5 attacks they do is unblockable, and this is all 3 characters remember. So I've breezed up to this point, but now because I can't use my own team (and the passive benefits that provides) I need to bring two cards that are wildly OP in order to finish this battle. When you're stripped of your team passives and the ability to block while the computer has both of those advantages the fight is insanely cheap.

The rampant and unpredictable difficulty in the fights in this game need to be addressed. You can be going along just fine then BAM! They give you a fight that's in a different league from the ones that preseded it in the same damn tower. If this was a boss battle I could almost be ok with the cheapness, but it's just fight 4/6.

Cheap. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I must say this game doesn't disappoint on the whole. Sure the multiplayer suffers from lag, but the lag seems largely consistent so I can usually work around it. Certainly no worse than MK9 and Injustice as far as I can tell.

The graphics are awesome, not the best I've seen, but definitely "next gen", which is something we've seen too little of since the consoles launched IMO.

Sound design. Top notch! I know they put a lot of work into the sound for the game and it shows. All the right crunches and whooshes are there.

Story mode. The best story mode in any fighting game I've played. Worth playing just for the cut scenes. I'm glad Netherealm put so much time into what is now a largely ignored fighting game mode. I love the fact that as well as each character having their own unique arcade mode ending there's a singular canon narrative to play through that solidifies everything story wise.

Music. Can't complain. It does the job, reminds me of MK9.

Krypt. I think this is a fun way to unlock stuff in a game, best krypt so far IMO.

Basically I'm loving this game more than I was hoping I would. I only have a couple of gripes, but they're small and easily ignored when looking at the game as a whole.

1. No Noob Saibot. My mains are always Sub-Zero and Noob. At least Sub-Zero's good in this game.2
2. Sub-Zero's defaiult costume is ugly as hell! But there's plenty of good ones and the inclusion of the Klassic skin made up for the poor Kurrent one.
3. I miss the avatrs from the old KoTH mode. But oh well.

What do you guys think of the game? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Anyone else really happy that this exists? I've always hated the new Sub Zero design. I don't mind the Kuai Liang and Revenant kostumes but god DAMN the klassic skin is too sexy. Feels great to represent my boy Sun Zero with him looking the way I remember. After giving him the MKII klassic skin in MK9 I love the fact they went for the UMK3 klassic skin this time.

Any other costumes you guys are super happy with?

I know it's the premium currency and they want to make you buy them but god damn they're slow to earn. At this stage I think I actually prefer the "buy characters for a ridiculous amount of gold" system they used in Injustice. At least with that system I always felt like I was earning currency to go towards characters.

I suppose factions will include some way of earning souls. Whenever they actually manage to make it work that is. </TEXT>

I mean, I know bosses are meant to be tougher than their henchmen but when you can simply breeze through 6 or 7 fights then all of a sudden hit a wall you can't get past until you seriously upgrade your cards, that's surely an issue? Is there any particular reason (other than to try to hassle you into buying microtransactions) why they would do this? </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2015-04-10 15:18:31 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I was expecting this game to be at least as fun as Injustice but from what I can tell so far it's. It's not even close.

The animations look sloppy in the MK game. They look like they were animated by amateurs. The animations on injustice were crisp, clear, and just better looking, they flowed more realistically. 

I call bull on the control scheme. I was told that like Injustice if you tap you get a weak combo and if you swipe you get a heavy combo. Well, so far tapping and swiping have done nothing but activate the same two combos. There's literally no difference between tapping and swiping, meaning that when I tell my character to attack I have no idea what he's going to do. Is this a problem with the game or jut my version? I'd be interested in hearing.

There's so many other little things that injustice did right that MK mobile just does wrong. It's like this game was made before injustice.

How do you evade specials that involve throws? Seems awfully cheap of you can't do the equivalent of blocking them like other specials.

I was expecting something so much better. I was expecting injustice with MK characters. What I got was what genuinely feels like a cheap injustice knock-off. And I don't know how they managed to do that.

I'm still playing the game obviously, I'm having to rely on blind hope that the game actually improves and begins to feel good to play, but if what I've played so far is any indicator of how bad this game is to play, then I'll have to be out, and I don't want to be out. 

What are your thoughts on the game so far? </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2015-03-10 11:34:32 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> My current favourite team is MKX Scorpion, CCBG, and ABB. The gear I use with this team is as follows.

MKX = Bone Spikes, Mark of the Tiger, and Ra's Al Ghul's Scimitar

CCBG = Carbonfiber Mask, Dark Sword, and Nullification Rifle.

ABB = Azarthian Cloak, Icebound Necklace, The Batmobile.

I know I'd be better off using the scimitar on Batgirl as he combo ender does two hits instead of one but I prefer having it on Scorpion.

My question is this. Is the Batmobile gear useless? I play online mode almost exclusively and almost never get any super's charged up. I usually just use my s2 abilities to win the fights, so is the Batmobile useless? Is it really worth it to charge up enough power to use a super (that will do splash damage) when by that point the fight is almost over and the 1 hit super is less effective than the 4 hit s2 ABB does? </TEXT>
