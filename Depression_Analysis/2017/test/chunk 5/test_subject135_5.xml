	<TEXT> Everything that's been said already is correct, but colonel is an exceptionally strange case.

1540s, coronell, from Middle French coronel (16c.), modified by dissimilation from Italian colonnella "commander of a column of soldiers at the head of a regiment," from compagna colonella "little column company," from Latin columna "pillar" (see column). English spelling modified 1580s in learned writing to conform with the Italian form (via translations of Italian military manuals), and pronunciations with "r" and "l" coexisted 17c.-18c., but the earlier pronunciation prevailed. Spanish coronel, from Italian, shows a similar evolution by dissimilation.

But it's not arbitrary. They need to balance making a profit against the likelihood that someone will pay the increased rent. If they raise it too high above other comparable apartments in the area, you might move and nobody else will rent it. If they raise it too little, they won't feel they're making enough money. 

Most likely they will raise it $100 a month or thereabouts. </TEXT>

Not true. Non-Jews have no obligation to observe Saturday or any other day as the Sabbath. If they follow a religion with a different Sabbath day, there's nothing wrong with that. 

Here's how Christianity's Sunday Sabbath developed:

	<TEXT> Within the 12% of North Americans who claim left-handedness, there are some interesting demographic variations. As regards gender, men are slightly more likely than women to be left-handed, with most studies indicating that about 13% of men and just under 11% of women are left-handed (men are NOT twice as likely to be left-handed as is sometimes claimed). It has been suggested this occurs because girls are more receptive to social mores and more likely to conform than boys (although there may also be a genetic component).

	<TEXT> today I read a fact that the mental condition and stress levels of teenagers is close to that of mental patients in the 1950s.

This is a widely misused quote/statistic. It was originally reported in the 1980s, then a meta-analysis was done in 2000 about studies done through 1993. I can't find anything more recent. But even if anxiety has only gone up since 1993, it's part of a continuing trend, not something that is distinctly new about the 21st century.

The only reason why things seem more prevalent than they used to be is because of the Internet and more of a willingness to admit things like depression, especially among boys.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Pandora's explanation:

Free Pandora accounts permit 6 skips per hour per station, for up to 24 total skips per day across all stations. The daily skip limit helps us prevent having to pay royalties on songs that are not being heard.

Upgrading to Pandora One increases your 24-hour skip limit, but does not remove the skip limit entirely. You can learn more about Pandora One here.

A skip is considered to be a skipped song, a Thumbs-down rating, or choosing "I'm tired of this track" in the menu of the music player.

Licensing is one of the most expensive aspects of providing the service, and we must pay the full royalties for a song, even if it only plays for a few seconds.

	<TEXT> Or Wizard's Hall by Jane Yolen. Interesting that the Books of Magic and Wizard's Hall came out within a year of each other. Clearly this was an idea that was percolating and Rowling caught the bug too, only it took her seven more years to put her book out.

In 1991, the author Jane Yolen released a book called Wizard's Hall, to which the Harry Potter series bears a resemblance. The main protagonist, Henry (also called Thornmallow), is a young boy who joins a magical school for young wizards.[74] At the school "he must fulfill an ancient prophecy and help overthrow a powerful, evil wizard."[75] However, Yolen has stated that "I'm pretty sure she never read my book," attributing similarities to commonly-used fantasy tropes.[76] In an interview with the magazine Newsweek, Yolen said, "I always tell people that if Ms. Rowling would like to cut me a very large check, I would cash it."[77] Yolen stopped reading Harry Potter after the third book, and has expressed dislike for the writing style of Harry Potter, calling it "fantasy fast food".[77][78]

	<TEXT> I think children of capable of understanding the concept of "bad touch" versus "I find this really annoying but I'm willing to put up with it because old person." 

I saw your comment below in the thread and at least where I'm from, boys are much more likely to get their cheeks pinched than girls. It's a different dynamic than you (and possibly) OP is describing. So if the touching comes off as creepy it would be better to tell to stop, but pinching, while not fun, is clearly harmless.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I once took a creative writing course (adult ed, not college) and I found it completely unhelpful. Each week we focused on a different aspect of writing (e.g., character, plot, description) and we had to read a short story that illustrated this technique, write a little in class and do a homework assignment. Maybe because one week per technique wasn't enough or maybe because I'm not the kind of person who can produce a story on demand, but I felt this was completely unhelpful.

Though I did eventually develop a story idea that has a ton of potential and I've been writing about it ever since, so at least I had that going for me.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is completely untrue. Popcorn is actually quite healthy and has tons of nutritional value. It is an excellent snack.

And the facts speak for themselves: a single portion of popcorn contains more antioxidants than all the fruit and veg most people eat in a day, as noted in a study by Scranton University. Antioxidants keep molecules harmful to cells in check, and are present in many fresh fruits and vegetables. Popcorn also has a large amount of vitamins; folate, niacin, riboflavin, thiamine, vitamins B, A, E, and K, as well as being a source of iron, potassium, zinc, and polyphenols which contain the antioxidants to fight off cancers and cardiovascular health problems.

	<TEXT> This article is a mess. 

The reason why relationships can't be based on explicit exchange is because hardly anybody can handle the truth about themselves or anybody else. Not too many people are going to be honest about their failings as a friend or partner, and in any event, most people are willing to put up with their loved one's failings even to the extent that they put up with abusers.

But it's also because in every relationship, there's always somebody who loves/gives/does more and somebody who loves/gives/does less because there are no two people who are exactly alike and are in exactly the same circumstances. </TEXT>

Fat doesn't conduct heat well, so while it does insulate your body, it feels colder to the touch. So wherever you have larger fat stores, those parts will feel colder. 

Another thing is that your hands and feet are more likely to have poorer blood circulation than the rest of your body so they're more likely to feel cold.  </TEXT>

Yes, that's right. Traditionally Jews gave their children Hebrew names and then at some point they added Yiddish names, which tended to be translations of the Hebrew name. Like Tzipporah-Feigie, which both mean bird. And then when English names came around, they tended to give English translations of the Hebrew names like Rivka-Rebecca. 

I've known Jewish people with Gaelic names and all kinds of European names, so it's odd that Nicholas specifically would be off the table.

	<TEXT> I have a couple of friends who have Fridays off for different reasons and the way it works is that Thursday night is for shopping and Friday is for preparing for the Sabbath. They never use those times for leisure activities. (One is single and the other is married with children, so you can't even say that it's the fault of their situations. Their situations could not be more different.) 

If I were offered the option of having off on Friday but not Sunday, I would not take the offer.

And for secular people, they'd adjust to having Sunday off instead of Friday pretty easily. Considering that hundreds of millions of people around the world have off on Sunday, it's not like this is some kind of impossible thing to deal with.  </TEXT>

While it's nice to be able to have the whole day to prepare for the Sabbath, that's exactly the problem. The only thing you can do (especially in the winter) is have time to prepare for the Sabbath. So if you want to go to the beach in the summer or hang out with some friends or go to a concert on Saturday night, you're not going to be able to do that.

Having Sunday off works better regardless of whether you're a Sabbath observer or not. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's a name that's strongly associated with Christianity. So any Jew who really cares about being Jewish and transmitting the tradition to the next generation would not give their child that name. Anybody who's a ham-and-cheese Jew will do whatever they want.

From the Greek name  (Nikolaos) which meant "victory of the people" from Greek  (nike) "victory" and  (laos) "people". Saint Nicholas was a 4th-century bishop from Anatolia who, according to legend, saved the daughters of a poor man from lives of prostitution. He is the patron saint of children, sailors and merchants, as well as Greece and Russia. He formed the basis for the figure known as Santa Claus (created in the 19th century from Dutch Sinterklaas), the bringer of Christmas presents.

Due to the renown of the saint, this name has been widely used in the Christian world. It has been common in England since the 12th century, though it became a bit less popular after the Protestant Reformation. The name has been borne by five popes and two czars of Russia.
