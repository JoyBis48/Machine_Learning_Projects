	<TEXT> Hey R4R! I'm short and often grouchy and easily creeped out, and I need friends! Maybe more than friends? But mostly just friends. Anyone local? Male or female. I like working on cars, beer, bacon, boobs, baking, books, nail polish, knitting, and my dog.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In the fall I had a feeling my ex's (who I'm still VERY weirdly close with) girlfriend was pregnant. Sure enough he told me she was. I looked at my mum that day and said "He's not gonna be a dad." I had no idea what I meant at the time but I had this feeling that something bad was going to happen. About 6 weeks later he told me she had had a miscarriage. 

Also ever since I had surgery in December I seem to be seeing things in corners and blurry places here and there and the odd shadow with no cause. Something about being put under I think. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Same here actually. My grandad's family used to just KNOW stuff and in the last few months I've found myself KNOWING things I have no possible way of knowing. We're also prone to seeing people in places they aren't. I basically got a dog for the express purpose of letting me know when the people I see are real. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm working really hard on convincing myself they're not. I was waiting outside the recovery room for a friend after major surgery this week and kept seeing people/whatever in the hallway out of the corner of my right eye. There was no one there. It was bad. At home I'm mostly just seeing blurry spots/shadows and my cats are wild all the time. My therapy dog can't be bothered with it though I've noticed she sleeps a lot closer to me at night now. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey OP. I'm a nanny and I've had a lot of strange experiences. One thing I've learned is if you want people to believe you, you need to take videos or pictures and hand them over to someone who can be objective. You could consider wall mounted baby monitors or a camcorder on a tripod, or even a cell phone video. You could also try a line of salt or brick dust at your doorway to see if she can cross it, and I would get in touch with the priest as soon as you can. Something else to consider, for someone who may be a bit more open minded, you could try contacting your local paranormal society. It seems most places have them and they can usually be contacted via facebook or a local shop. Good luck and keep us updated.  </TEXT>
