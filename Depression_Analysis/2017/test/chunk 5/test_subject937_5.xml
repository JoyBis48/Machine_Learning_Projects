	<TEXT> I _can_ distinguish between the two. But I also know that people with power tend to use that power. Keeping the two departments separate does not mean the owner's influence isn't felt: who is hired/fired, who is promoted, who gets invited to lunch, etc.

And then, yes, there are the people who cannot or do not distinguish the two. If you're worried about how the paper is perceived, it's not enough to say, "Well they shouldn't think that." They _do_, and that's the reality that must be dealt with.

_The Augusta Chronicle_ consistently wins awards and that speaks very well of the reporting side. But there's always that nagging thought that supporting the paper means you're supporting the editorial staff (because, well, you are to a degree - you're giving it a platform).

My main point is that the paper is perceived as a whole, facts be damned. This means that the hyper-fringe nature of the editorial staff causes people to shun the news content. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's definitely a possibility, and maybe even likely. But when the editorial staff is so obviously *not* reasonable, readers are going to see that throughout the paper.

It's like trying to claim FOXNews isn't O'Reilly, Hannity, etc. Or MSNBC isn't Maddow, Sharpton, Matthews, etc. I understand the difference between news and opinion, but also know that it is impossible to keep them 100% separate in practice. </TEXT>

It's not completely unreasonable to believe he uses his influence to push certain news stories and not others.

The editorial staff is hurting the overall paper. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Legally, there is a concept called the Eggshell Rule which essentially means you take your victim as they are. If someone has brittle bones and you punch them causing them to break 10 bones, you are liable. If they have a heart condition and you scare them causing a heart attack, you are liable.

I'm not sure if NY has a version of this rule but it is common. </TEXT>
