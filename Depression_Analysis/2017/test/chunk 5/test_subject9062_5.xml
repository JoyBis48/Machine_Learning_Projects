	<TEXT> A man who declined to be identified told a Reuters photographer that a teenaged girl in a nightgown came to his house, running barefoot through a snowy wooded area and crying that her parents had been shot. They called police and law enforcement officials found her parents dead at their home.

Authorities said they later discovered five other people dead and a wounded woman in three other houses. The woman, who is expected to recover, gave them information about the shooter, Texas County Sheriff James Sigman said.

Four of the victims were identified as Garold Aldridge, 52, his wife Julie Aldridge, 47, Harold Aldridge, 50, and his wife Janell Aldridge, 48.

Authorities would not identify the other victims, but the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported that they were Carey Shriver and his wife Valirea Shriver, and Carey's father Darrell Shriver. Darrell's wife Martha was wounded but survived, the paper said. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Worried that the fighting might escalate further and knowing that guns and ammunition were around the house, the 14-year-old started gathering what she could find to hide it.

"(The girl) said all the guns were in easily accessible places," the complaint said. "(She) said that, fearing one of her parents would pick up a gun and use it against the other, she tried to grab all the guns and ammunition. (She) said she put the guns/ammunition she could gather into her bedroom, to get them away from her parents."

Police searched the home and found five guns that belonged to Wright, according to the complaint. A Mossberg 500 12-gauge shotgun and a Smith   Wesson AR 5 rifle were in a child's room.

	<TEXT> Same here. I thought of my own child when he accidentally spills something and says "Sorry mom, I spilled my drink"...and how this kid said "I'm sorry, Mom. I shot Corbin." 

The adults surrounding those two boys failed them both. I hope the five year old gets massive support and counseling, but I fear that's not something you ever get over. God damnit.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I see stories like this daily, but this one wrecks me. Where is the nationwide PSA? Where are the safe storage laws being demanded by the survivors?? Where is the accountability here? This five year old's life is forever damaged.  </TEXT>
