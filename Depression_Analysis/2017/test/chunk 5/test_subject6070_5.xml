	<TEXT> I teach high school history and I have gotten some great simulations off of tpt. To me it is worth it to pay three dollars than to spend hours creating all the things I would need. But sometimes I just browse it for ideas, and don't buy anything. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So I should preface this with the fact that I taught the civil rights movement all week, but I had a dream that Malcolm X broke into my house to rape me , but I was totally into him so we had consensual sex and then I made him pancakes and we talked about environmental protection. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I love that I work with people who are intelligent and able to have an open debate and not get emotional or take statements personally. I love that I teach 155 kids about history , and I make it as interesting as possible. I love it when I tell a joke that only half the class gets and then 30 seconds later the other half gets it. I love seeing awkward freshmen bloom into young adults. I love it when a kids speaks their mind for the first time, when they have really thought a bout a subject and come to their own conclusion. I love that my job makes me want to be a better person everyday. I love that I get to be creative, that I push myself to do better than the day before. I love my VP who works his ass off , and checks in on the teachers, I love our guidance counselors who bend over backwards to get kids services, and make sure they meet graduation requirements. I love going to the beach on a random tuesday during the summer with a book. Teaching is an amazing important beautiful wonderful job, I feel like the luckiest girl in the world somedays  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We had a first year teacher this year with 4 preps and no prior education experience. I think he had a degree is bussiness and was teaching marketing type classes. He quit 6 weeks in he didn't realized what teaching would be like and   he didn't have the skills or support to push through it. It isn't for everyone, that guy was a smart, good guy who will be great at someone's company he just wasn't meant to be a teacher. The same way that I would probably crash and burn at a marketing firm. What others have said is helpful too take a day off ask for help, see what is on teachers pay teachers on days when you are overwhelmed with planning. It gets easier , but if you don't like it and it,s making your life miserable then getting a routine down isn't going to make you love it all of the sudden. Best of luck whatever you decide to do. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For clarification, I wasn't suggesting that they were the same thing I was posing a question more about people's attitudes toward them. The vast majority of people now think slavery is wrong , I was asking if people might also feel that way about eating meat in the future. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is a well.thought out responce. I teach US history, we are doing a unit on slavery and there are just so many parallels . Especially how abolitionists were seen as extremist, and mocked for their beliefs. I think that the move towards veganism will happen out of necessity of saving resources, rather than moral issues. But who knows the movement is gaining traction everyday and it is becoming more mainstream, so here is hopping. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I teach us, government , and economics. For government check out the following websites I am on a mobile or I would link them icivics, the national archives, the library of congress and cspan. Start my government classes off with a news clip and we discuss the governments role in it. For us and world check out the reading like a historian website, they have some good lessons, also check with your media center to see if the have dbqs that you can use. Contact the socail studies person from your district and ask them to come observe you one day and give you some suggestions. I do a lot of hands on stuff but it kind of just comes to me as the year goes on. I had world students hold 30lbs and take a lap aroynd the room to simulate armor that a night wore. I had boys and girls put on high heals when we talked about foot binding. In us I have them make artifacts from the 13 colonies out of play dough, they build shanty towns out of cardboard boxes when we study the great depression, we simulate trench warfare when we study WW I . For govermnet you can run simulations of passing a bill by breaking students into groups and having them vote and make changes as they see fit. Hope that helps a bit, I didn't have much help my first year trust your judgment, experiment some days will be awesome sometimes it will be an epic failure, but you monitor and adjust and move forward. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As a graduate from the citadel, it is his class ring, the class ring at the citadel is more than just a ring it is proof you made it through four crazy difficult years. It opens many doors, cadets look out for each other it is a political tool for most graduates . Cadets always wear their ring , the school actually pays for 51% of it so if you disgrace the school they can legally take your ring away from you. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I find the difference of ideas between the founding fathers fascinating especially Jefferson and Hamilton. Ben Franklin was a bit of a scoundrel, so talking about him and peppering in some funny antidotes about his personal life would keep the lecture interesting. Like others have said know your audience.
