	<TEXT> for private plates you have to renew every year and if you don't it reverts back to the original plate number 

Just to be a pedant, this isn't actually true. 

Private plates on /retention/ (that is, not on a car but rather on a piece of paper) have to be renewed annually, but private plates on a car remain with the car for life, or until the owner transfers it away to another car (or retention). If you sell the car, the plates go with it and, in fact, its been known for cheap cars to change hands at inflated prices so the buyer can transfer the plate into his Merc ;-)

	<TEXT> Scots are, by absolute, incontrovertible fact, also British. They can deny it all they want, but it doesn't make it any less true! Scotland is part of Great Britain and (arguably, more importantly) also part of the United Kingdom. Obviously, a good percentage of Scots aren't tremendously happy with this, but plenty are and, as a country, they decided to remain part of the union. 

For myself, I was brought up in Scotland (though I be a sassenach at heart) and though I now reside elsewhere, I'm proud of what little Scottishness I absorbed in my time there.

I have spent many a happy day in Glasgow (in fact, the last time I stayed was in the very hotel being shown on these horrible pictures) and I feel deeply sad for those affected by this. I don't suppose it was anything more than a tragic accident, but that doesn't make it any less awful :-/ </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Errr, it is.

Great Britain, typically referred to as "Britain" includes Scotland and thus Glasgow. Of course you could have also been referring to The United Kingdom and of course that too includes Glasgow (they voted for that and everything!)

Leaving this aside, nasty scenes in Glasgow that I don't think anyone, North or South of the border wants to see :-/ </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not quite sure that Rubens was quite as chilled out as perhaps he came across on the day. This gives a different take on it:

http://www.grandprix247.com/2012/05/10/barrichello-reveals-how-ferrari-forced-him-to-lose-2002-austrian-gp/

In effect, he argued with the team for 8 laps and in the end, they threatened to sack him if he didn't let Schumacher past. Rubens had no choice but concede and I'm amazed at his composure after the race! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'd just like to say that very little of this applies to the EU for the majority of people. The US is simply insane in what people will accept as normal!

I work 40 hours (although I do oversee updates on evenings occasionally). Rarely work outside of normal hours IG I can help it.

I always smile when I see the US referred to as the land of the free...I think this doesn't apply to the inhabitants :-/ </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I remember Top Gear talking about some Scandinavian banger racing series that worked to the same system:

You could spend whatever you like on your car, but if a competitor wants to buy it off you, you /must/ sell it for 500 (or similar). Such a system was self regulating, easily policed and kept the series low-cost for everyone.

I like the idea of Vijay walking into the Red Bull garage and buying their car for 250,000 :-) </TEXT>
