	<TEXT> My favorite song hands down off Dark Side, no question about it. Listening to that solo in the right environment is a border line religious experience. Also the lyricism in this song is so superb, and it's genius for them to do the Breathe Reprise, I absolutely love this tune. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As you can see, less than half my artists have had an album come out in 2014, but thats all good. I finally listened to artists that I never really listened to before and I loved them. I might also add youtube links to some songs from these artists :) 

* 1) Pink Floyd - knew about them of course, really delved into their material and was blow away, I consider them one of my favorite bands of all-time. I even enjoyed The Endless River, to a certain extent, even though a lot of people didn't as much. I think that album has a time and place, and can't be listened to at any moment like some of their albums


* 2) The Killers - liked them when I was younger, got back into them and I think Sam's Town has aged realllllly well


* 3) Sage Francis - Man did this dude's new album swing hard, wooooo I love his venom


* 4) Modest Mouse - always knew the "hits" but listened to them a bunch more, I really dig the song, "Bankrupt On Selling"

* 5) Gorillaz - listened to the entire Demon Dayz album, and holllly shiiiit, it was gnarly


* 6) Twenty One Pilots - These two dudes have become one of my favorite bands, I think after their 3rd album these guys are gonna explode more than they already have, I'm super looking forward to their next project

* 7) Marina and the Diamonds - I was debating on not putting her on here, primarily because her lyrics aren't great and all that negative connotations that pop music brings, but I'll be damned if I didn't find her so catchy. She's my guilty pleasure - come hate me haha


*  8) St. Vincent - Digital Witnesses is my favorite song off her latest album, it's a fun album for me


* 9) The Naked   Famous - first heard them in FIFA, I totally dig their style and the female singer is something I totally dig

* 10) Atmosphere - Southsiders had it's moments, not the greatest album, I think I enjoyed it more than most Atmosphere fans. Flicker is my favorite song because I'm an Eyedea fan, so I thought it was a great song. I also started listening to his older discog a bit more, and I think Slug can straight spit fire

	<TEXT> I was born in '93, well after the PF break-up, and from what it seems, the PF break-up was popular news and shown in the media. (This could be wrong, I'm not sure how well covered it was by media outlets.) I was just wondering if there was anyone on here that had first hand accounts of watching this legendary band slowly and publicly fall out with each other (I know all the members weren't on the forefront). Basically I want to know how heartbreaking it was to watch Waters and Gilmour fight over something so revered. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think they've also used RHCP songs, I can't remember exactly which ones. But I remember Flea was pretty upset for obvious reasons, his music is meant to make people happy and inspire them, not make them go insane. ( Even though the song Easily makes me go insane( in a good way though)) Could anyone be so kind to fact check me on this? I'm on my phone and can't really navigate as easily. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No order

* David Gilmour (Never heard anyone manipulate a guitar and sounds quite like him)

* Jimi Hendrix (obvious, also he played a right-handed guitar upside down, need I say more)

* Pete Townshend (One of my favorite older rockers with some iconic moves that I love)

* Mike McCready (Pearl Jam's guitarist, I think he's very underrated, probably not top 5 all time, but he's in my list because I just love his solos)

* Jimmy Page (Double neck motha fuckaaaaassssss)

* John Frusciante ( I can't believe I forgot him in my original group :( ... He's literally one of my favorite people on the face of the planet)

EDIT: Woops I only did 5, so I added the 6th and messed up a bunch of spelling  </TEXT>

My favorite part on The Wall is Nobody Home through Comfortably Numb, other than that, I only revisit the album for Hey You, and sometimes Young Lust. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It seems that both albums are necessary as a precept for Dark Side, however, I'm not sure how OBC would have changed things if released before meddle. It's weird to think that OBC should have been released beforehand, as it has more of the psychedelic feel like ASoS or AHM. Meddle seems almost out of place because it's harder rock feel with One of these days and Echoes. I think if meddle wasn't released then OBC would be looked at with greater regard but I think echoes completely overshadows it. It's too much of a powerhouse song for the pre-dark side era. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Quite frankly I think it's way too early to predict the longevity of this album... It's been out for a month. Sure it probably won't be one of the most influential albums ever or ever stand toe-to-toe with other PF classics, but I think pretty much every PF has a time and place for the most part. I think Obscured by Clouds is one of PF's most underrated albums by far, that doesn't mean it's not a timeless and important album in the PF story. I feel like this is a good ending to the historic career of PF, few words are needed and the music speaks for itself.


EDIT: this isn't meant to sound confrontational, I just think its a bit premature to predict what people will be listening to in 2049. Heaven knows I'll be old as shit blasting PF as the 'young thugs' play their beeps and boops </TEXT>

It's what we do is great, sum and skins go so well together, I absolutely love anisina. I also love allons-y 1 through allons-y 2, and then I thought side 4 was really good top, perhaps the best (3 and 4 are tied) however I did find that it's more of a situational album for me than their other albums. I can usually only pop TER while doing hw or studying, but for those situations I think it's a great album. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A-ha! I love telling people how I go into rock (specifically classic rock). The short answer School of Rock... now hear me out. I was in like 7th grade at the time, probably younger when I first watched it to be honest. But the scene where "My Brain is Hanging Upsidedown" by the Ramones is playing and Jack Black did that montage with teaching all the kids about the history of rock and how to play. I don't know... as a young kid learning about music, I realized, "holy shit, there's a lot more complexity to music and influences than I realized." So I began with just a lot of classic rock for many and many years, now I branched out a great deal since then. But Pink Floyd is still the greatest band ever :P </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Need help with suggestions for two different questions, one about Stevie Ray Vaughan and one about Tom Waits </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-12-20 02:02:46 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Okay I have two questions that are pretty short, sweet and to the point. They are also unrelated so don't assume I'm gonna try to make any observations about these fellas.

* Can anyone recommend some really strong electrically driven blues music like Stevie Ray Vaughan? I've heard some other blues, but I don't really attack onto them like I do SVR's, I like guitar that just rips through songs.


* Also, I've only listened to Tom Waits very briefly and saw on here his Rain Dogs album mentioned. I'm listening to it and I'm about halfway through. What should I be listening for in particular. Usually when I listen to new stuff I have it on in the background and just listen to the music, and not necessarily the lyrics. But this seems like an album that I need to listen to the narrative that he generates. So should I give this album more attention, or is there another reason that people have recommended it? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Pink Floyd: Us and Them (as mentioned below), Gunner's Dream, Two Suns in the Sunset, Wearing the Inside Out, Shine on you Crazy Diamond, Dogs of War (not particularly fond of this song, but there's no denying the groovy saxiness at about the 4 min mark), Anisina (off The Endless River, one of my favorite tracks from that album)

	<TEXT> I've been playing a lot of ARAMs lately, and there have been champs that I get the option to level my ultimate with and debate whether it's worth it or not. Mainly champs with ults that allow for backdoor abilities such as TF or Panth. I'm sure there are plenty of others, so that's why I'm asking. What are some champs that you don't level up their ult at level 6? </TEXT>

Also /u/MaxCHEATER64 would you be interested in doing a similar thing for good vocal performances e.g. Great Gig In the Sky, Gunner's Dream </TEXT>
