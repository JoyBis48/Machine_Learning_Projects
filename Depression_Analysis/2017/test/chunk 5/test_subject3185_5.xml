Market laws are not real laws anyway  the underlying premise of the article, and a good one  but when they are extended beyond their meaning, they become no more than tropes.

The other hidden term in the doom-sayers is a misreading of history. People recite the Microsoft/Apple war endlessly, but it really didnt happen that way. For a start, it was not Microsoft that made the PC the de facto standard, but IBM. With its massive brand leadership in business, when Big Blue decided to go with MS and Intel architecture, everyone else had to follow or go under. Atari, Amiga, and all the CP/m systems vanished within a few years. The only non-IBM clone survivor was Apple. However, IBM did not do so well out of it either, and eventually exited the market, selling its ThinkPad line to Lenovo. Most of the other players from the 80s and 90s are also long gone. Microsoft did prosper, but it did so on OEM buy-in for Windows, and subsequently on major systems like Exchange servers, and the ubiquity of Office. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I hope that, despite his persecution, people will follow Aaron's example of conscientious action and his commitment to the ideals of honesty and openness.

I think it's interesting that the government chose this particular case to go after Aaron on, especially considering that JSTOR didn't press any charges. I wonder if has anything to do with the way that the corporate state has locked up a lot of our society's knowledge in private database and expensive subscription system. I think Aaron's attack on this restrictive system was not so much a material threat as a symbolic one, and presented a serious challenge to a system that maintains legitimacy by keeping most of the public ignorant about its nature and its history. In such a circumstance, spreading information freely to the public is pretty much a revolutionary act. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Comments can be bad for science. That's why, here at PopularScience.com, we're shutting them off.
It wasn't a decision we made lightly. As the news arm of a 141-year-old science and technology magazine, we are as committed to fostering lively, intellectual debate as we are to spreading the word of science far and wide. The problem is when trolls and spambots overwhelm the former, diminishing our ability to do the latter.
That is not to suggest that we are the only website in the world that attracts vexing commenters. Far from it. Nor is it to suggest that all, or even close to all, of our commenters are shrill, boorish specimens of the lower internet phyla. We have many delightful, thought-provoking commenters.....  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well it is nice to see Wired not simply oohing and ahhing over the science of biotech crops as in the past. 

This articles shows EXACTLY why people are against GM crops. GM should be done to naturally defend against weeds instead of having tolerance to poisons Monsanto sells. The collective impact of repeated and increased poisons on the soil and eventually into our bodies will eventually take its toll.  

These 'solutions' promote widespread pesticide and herbicide use and make genetic changes with absolutely unknown future impact. Monsanto's patented corn genes have already spread into the wild with unknown consequences.

I wonder if maybe Monsanto will have a clone human they will sell that can tolerate the poisons they are spreading all over the earth.
