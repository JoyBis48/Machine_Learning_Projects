	<TEXT> I'm scared okay. I'm at uni in my second year all my friends are in their third (i had to stay and repeat second year while they all went on to third year) I'm lonely really lonely what am i gonna do next year i'm gonna have nobody i'm gonna have nobody of the people i've grown to love over uni. i feel bad for feeling like this is a problem people have actual problems in the world but this feels like a huge pit in my stomach. why would they keep in touch with me i feel like I'm recyclable  like all the other friends from school have have faded away despite efforts am i not worth keeping ? do they not love me as much as i love them ? when everyone else gets married and gets girlfriends why would i be included in the wedding party ? I'm scared of the future okay i still feel like i kid and i love that about myself i feel hopelessly alone like nobody seems to understand this might sound cliche but fuck it. I'm scared and alone everything about this scares me and in this society you're not a man if you talk about your feelings. i wear my heart on my sleeve yeah i cry i'm emotional but fuck it maybe i should bottle it. 

Thanks for reading this. even more thanks if it made sense.  </TEXT>
