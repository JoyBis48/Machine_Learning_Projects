	<TEXT> I agree.  My backseat is just an extended trunk.  I've had two single passengers back there, and it's good for them on their own, but if I had 4 people to haul, unless they were 10 or younger, I'd tell them to take a different car.   I love my ST, but I see it as a two adult, and a couple of kids, car.  Not 5 adults.  </TEXT>

Once they get there, they might realize that you're a woman and turn up the bullshit and creepy meter, but it was the open hood that first brought them over.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The defense is this: I was being bullied, taunted, and harassed, then in my interpretation at the time, was attacked from behind, so I defended myself.  In fact, the whole thing got caught on tape.  Oh, she was just stepping onto the desk I was sitting at? Ok, I still defended myself.  No body has the right to decide to climb on me, without my permission.  That's the defense.  Seems pretty straight forward.  </TEXT>
