	<TEXT> * Chrome and Firefox security i feel is almost at par with each other.  They both get owned at Pwn2Own and every other contest, so its just evolution. Multiprocess(Electrolysis) is coming to Firefox soon.    
* Chrome is quite ahead on HTML5 support true, but Google has a lot of "only works on chrome" going that will hurt the open web for the future. Google being in a more dominant position also tries to make switch which is in their favor at times (eg. recent HTML5 switch on YouTube - Media Source Extensions )  
* UI customization. Hands down. Nobody comes close to Firefox.
* I think Firefox also wins here with the support of Firefox Sync, and it is cross-platform(iOS version coming soon). But each to his own.  
* Privacy - Cant stress this enough to matter because people just DON'T want to value it; Went you get Chrome from Google, there is and always will be some form of Privacy trade off.   
Firefox is for pro-privacy and supports DO NOT TRACK tech. Chrome is just a blind NO to this question. 
Mozilla doesn't want your data but Google will surely want it some how.    
* READER MODE! :D (i love this on android now, will come soon to Desktop)  
* Extension support - I personally feel Firefox rules this (maybe the fanboy in me)  
* Firefox on Top of the [Browser GrandPrix](http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/chrome-27-firefox-21-opera-next,3534-12.html).  2013 yes - didn't find a new one :( .  
Also beat chrome out on [benchmarks](http://arewefastyet.com/) - Lower is better.  
* Personally hate the new "Works on Chrome" or "works on webkit" views. If you're a dev YOU SHOULD ensure your site works everywhere. Another reason i stick to Non-Webkit browsers.  

EDIT - Chrome is Tetsuo aka RAM hog :(  
As for "apps" on Firefox - https://marketplace.firefox.com/ </TEXT>

The only champion car on the grid is the Merc and every thing else doesn't matter, Alonso saying if they(Ferrari) are not on the top, his move was fine, seems alright to me now.

	<TEXT> It certainly is possible, you just need the right color palette.   
Digital Painting isn't that bad with gimp. Once you get a hang of the brushes and brush settings your work flow will be smoother.   
Path tool can help you with sharp edges or strokes.  
Also use layers, definitely helps and saves time on mistakes.   

If you're trying to Make something of the face mash thing like the images you posted, know how to cut out images properly. Use layers, set warmth tones, use curves, blur and clone tool. 

Edit - combine multiple software like krita, mypaint and Gimp, you'll finish much faster  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ah im not sure if this is gonna help you, but with bumblebee installed and running, you could use "optirun -b auto nvidia-settings -c :8" to activate nvidia-settings and create specific Application Profiles.  

Other option could be to use the Nvidia proprietary drivers(incase you're still on nouveau).  
In PowerMizer set to Max Performance.  

Also check out these guides, might help you:

Hope you find a solution! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> i think your app should be able to use GPU when needed automatically.  
Maybe if your look around you could set some parameter/command to permanently run the app with a GPU. Or the Nvidia Settings Manager could be of help.  
As far as i know the battery drains as fast as the usage. When your hooked to the power port, it just lets current pass through, nothing more i feel.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> well since you've turned off optimus, your power consumption has shot up. Your only other way around is to disable the GPU In BIOS if it does support such a feature.  
Me currently using bumblebee and its your best shot for proper power management. I think its better than the nvidia-prime thing.

Other than enabling MSE(which i currently avoid due to A/V sync issue); anyone know what could be the trouble or a fix for it?

You get the 45MB+ updates when you haven't updated for a few days time.

	<TEXT> I remember trying out Chrome when it launched, its was good then, but i continued using FF.  
After a while i started reading about all the amazing headfake techniques chrome uses(like faster animations) to make people believe its faster. Once android came, i knew Chrome would rise to a peak and so much control to a corporate wasn't good i felt.  
And NSA happened too.  

Stuck with Firefox all these years(From version 1.3 or 1.5) and i still love this browser! I hope once they launch the iOS version soon, Mozilla will get a better hold of the mobile market, and also if they launch on Windows Phone it will be a win too. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Had a canvas 2, i used it for 2 years, pretty good phone, even though it was big.  Somehow adjusted and got used to the size. I gave up on them when no sources were released and no further OS updates by Micromax. Also a horrible Service center experience.  

Switched to the Moto G 2ng Gen. (2014).  
Its well designed, has the same screen size of 5 inches like the Canvas 2 but the curved back, the thinner screen edge bezels, super comfortable to hold and with a feel-good material Motorola has won me over completely.  
Also Brilliant Hardware performace and Awesome reliability on Software Update and love for almost-Stock Android experience.   </TEXT>
