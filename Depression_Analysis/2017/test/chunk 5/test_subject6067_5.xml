	<TEXT> Very cool, thank you for your input :)  My old scale showed body fat % but I like how aria shows lean body mass.  I'm lazy about it too.  Although I log my weight daily, I don't log all the other numbers.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey guys!  I've been using FitBit since launch and love it.  I've been looking at getting FitBit's Aria but wanted to know how you guys liked it.  How accurate do you think the scale is in general?  I had a scale once that would change the weight every time I got off and back on... ehh.. lol.   How accurate does it measure the body fat % + lean mass%?  Any help would be appreciated :D </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Try using Tend Skin after you shave.  Also make sure you gently exfoliate the area as the hair grows out.  If you have really curly pubes it might be harder to get rid of bumps :( Try using Magic shave on it instead of a razor!  The silver sensitive can works quite well. </TEXT>
