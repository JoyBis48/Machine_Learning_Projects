Every major dietetic association in the world agrees that appropriately planned vegetarian and vegan diets are healthy for all stages of life. Yes, you need to pay attention to what you eat in order to make sure you are eating healthy, but that is the case regardless of whether or not you are vegetarian.

**[American Dietetic Association](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19562864)**

 It is the position of the American Dietetic Association that appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases. Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence, and for athletes.

**[Dietitians of Canada](http://www.dietitians.ca/Nutrition-Resources-A-Z/Factsheets/Vegetarian/Eating-Guidelines-for-Vegans.aspx)**

 A well planned vegan diet can meet all of these needs. It is safe and healthy for pregnant and breastfeeding women, babies, children, teens and seniors.

**[The British National Health Service](http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/Vegetarianhealth/Pages/Vegandiets.aspx)**

 With good planning and an understanding of what makes up a healthy, balanced vegan diet, you can get all the nutrients your body needs.

**[The British Nutrition Foundation](http://www.nutrition.org.uk/publications/briefingpapers/vegetarian-nutrition)**

 A well-planned, balanced vegetarian or vegan diet can be nutritionally adequate ... Studies of UK vegetarian and vegan children have revealed that their growth and development are within the normal range.

**[The Dietitians Association of Australia](http://daa.asn.au/for-the-public/smart-eating-for-you/nutrition-a-z/vegan-diets/)**

 Vegan diets are a type of vegetarian diet, where only plant-based foods are eaten. They differ to other vegetarian diets in that no animal products are usually consumed or used. Despite these restrictions, with good planning it is still possible to obtain all the nutrients required for good health on a vegan diet.

**[The United States Department of Agriculture](http://www.choosemyplate.gov/healthy-eating-tips/tips-for-vegetarian.html)**

 Vegetarian diets (*see context*) can meet all the recommendations for nutrients. The key is to consume a variety of foods and the right amount of foods to meet your calorie needs. Follow the food group recommendations for your age, sex, and activity level to get the right amount of food and the variety of foods needed for nutrient adequacy. Nutrients that vegetarians may need to focus on include protein, iron, calcium, zinc, and vitamin B12.

**[The National Health and Medical Research Council](http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/_files_nhmrc/publications/attachments/n55a_australian_dietary_guidelines_summary_130530.pdf)**

 Alternatives to animal foods include nuts, seeds, legumes, beans and tofu. For all Australians,
these foods increase dietary variety and can provide a valuable, affordable source of protein
and other nutrients found in meats. These foods are also particularly important for those who
follow vegetarian or vegan dietary patterns. Australians following a vegetarian diet can still meet nutrient requirements if energy needs are met and the appropriate number and variety of serves from the Five Food Groups are eaten throughout the day. For those eating a vegan diet, supplementation of B12 is recommended.

**[The Mayo Clinic](http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-living/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/vegetarian-diet/art-20046446)**

  A well-planned vegetarian diet (*see context*) can meet the needs of people of all ages, including children, teenagers, and pregnant or breast-feeding women. The key is to be aware of your nutritional needs so that you plan a diet that meets them.

**[The Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada](http://www.heartandstroke.com/site/c.ikIQLcMWJtE/b.3484249/k.2F6C/Healthy_living__Vegetarian_diets.htm)**

 Vegetarian diets (*see context*) can provide all the nutrients you need at any age, as well as some additional health benefits. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> EU countries import 35 million tons of soy beans and soy meal from north and south America every year - to use as feed for pigs, chickens and cows.

Cultivation of primarily genetically modified soy for export uses land in developing countries that could go toward sustainable agriculture.

But even in industrialized countries like Germany, globalized industrial livestock farming presents a pollution problem.

"[Animal waste] is the root of considerable environmental problems in Germany, particularly in regions with intensive livestock farming," explained agrarian economist Knut Ehlers of the German Environment Agency.

Although manure is also a fertilizer, too much is toxic for soil and water. The environmental impacts of factory farming "ultimately fall on the taxpayer," said Ehlers.

Such agriculture is unsustainable, Ehlers stressed. He hopes that aiming more public attention to the issue of soil depletion on the national and EU levels will lead to more sustainable policy-making, and development of organic agriculture.

[Source](http://www.dw.de/loss-of-fertile-soils-a-food-security-risk/a-18395856)

Plant farms are taking on a part of the issue of the overwhelming amount of excessive manure and waste generated by animal agriculture, and yet you are trying to throw them under the bus for not being entirely self-reliant? We have many other fertilizer options available. Be grateful that these farms take on some of the waste that you create. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As a utilitarian, I am going to say that the action would be justified if the benefit to you exceeds the harm to animals, and if it is the available option that maximizes the benefit and minimizes harm.

I think you would be hard pressed to find many real-world scenarios where raising animals oneself or hunting them in the sense that you are likely imagining would meet those criteria. However, I will say that hunting oysters, which are animals with very limited nervous systems as adults, could very well be justified. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You went from a bad justification to a terrible justification. It is not okay to pay people to abuse animals and slaughter them just because you enjoy it. You need to take into account both your enjoyment as well as the harm your actions cause to others in order to make an ethical decision.

The food chain is not an ethical theory (and you won't be any more likely to get eaten by other animals if you choose to eat less meat). 

There is no reason to say reactionary nonsense just because you don't like what /u/The_Same_Sun was saying. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So if great apes could be taught American sign language, or if parrots had been taught to speak as well as human children, or if dolphins called each other by name and spoke over underwater telephones, or if we had identified words in prairie dog language that communicate shape, size, color, and species of individuals then you would treat them with respect?

At the same time not all humans possess language or higher reason. There are young children, the severely mentally handicapped, the elderly and senile. Should we treat them as property and say their rights end where their owner says so? </TEXT>

This is a complete strawman argument. /u/anthonyharriet isn't saying we ought to live like humans did thousands of years ago. They are saying that the amount of meat the typical person (in the first world) eats today is well above what is considered healthy. </TEXT>
