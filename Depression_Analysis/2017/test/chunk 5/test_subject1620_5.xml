	<TEXT> I get red wine headaches from cheap reds, and sometimes good malbecs and a few others. I believe that these are Red Wine Headaches and not specifically the same type of headache as my migraines because they happen regardless of how I prepare for drinking. Seems safe to assume that people who suffer from migraines would be more susceptible to RWHs.

For me, overly processed alcohol like cheap beer and cheap spirits are worse culprits, but I believe it's the alcohol itself rather than the other ingredients </TEXT>
