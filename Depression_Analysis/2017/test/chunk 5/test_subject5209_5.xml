	<TEXT> I played disc golf back in college. One time at the course, I threw my disc and it came to a stop, leaning against a wooden fence post. I guess I wasn't paying much attention when I leaned over to grab it and I ended up sliding my middle finger down the grain of the post.

I ended up with a 2 inch splinter of wood being jammed up my middle fingernail...all the way. I had to go to the nearest urgent care facility to get shots in my finger and get it pulled out with tiny tweezers.

If I had any secrets that someone wanted to know at that time, I would have yelled them at the top of my lungs. </TEXT>

She refuses, he goes to hug her, and she pulls away. As he's riding away, she stares him down and then says "Papa!". He jumps off his horse and runs to her. She says "I'll say anything, just please don't go" and hugs him.
