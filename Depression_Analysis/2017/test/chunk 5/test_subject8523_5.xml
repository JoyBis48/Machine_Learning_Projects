	<TEXT> Today I noticed on my task bar a strange program opening and closing in a split second, I was quite concerned of what it was, I have never seen this before, I tried grabbing a screenshot of the logo that was being displayed on the taskbar http://imgur.com/KlHmE2o  
  
I also tried clicking on the program to see if any window came up, luckily one did, I managed too get a half assed screen shot of the message, slightly translucent, but readable  http://imgur.com/f1CuXkw  
  
Any help would be so awesome guys </TEXT>
