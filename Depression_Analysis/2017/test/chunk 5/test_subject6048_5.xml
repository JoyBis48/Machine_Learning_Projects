	<TEXT> Yeah there's plenty: Salazar, Hughes, McCarthy all solid. Pick up Tajiuan walker before tonight's game in case he goes lights out and there's a frenzy for him- you can always drop him if he sucks again. Keep an eye on Hutchinson for when he turns things around this season. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think he can, he's talented, and has power to hit 30 bombs. Problem for me isn't with him but with the brewers. The lineup just doesn't have a lot going on, without protection I can't see him succeeding. It says you're in an 8 team league, if that's what this is in reference to there's no way I'd roster him. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> More than two weeks. See what sabermetric sites like fangraphs say about their success. Usually a pretty good indicator if their getting lucky or not. I don't know what Volquez's peripherals are like this season, but given how he's been pretty much every season before this, he's due for massive regression. Every year he starts out hot, gets a lot of Ks, everyone points to that one good year he had, mostly he just has a great baseball name. But the implosion is inevitable. I'd sell high, but who knows, maybe he'll live up to the name this year. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> He'll definitely keep the starting job if he keeps performing like this. 2B is pretty horrible this year, and travis is in the perfect offense to succeed. Start googling him there's been a good amount of posts written on him. Optimistic he may be moved to the 2 hole, which would mean Bautista, Edwin and Donaldson would all be batting behind him. He's probably in the best position to succeed out of everyone at 2nd base

Edit: grammar. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Mind posting who's on your roster? You could probably get some opinions on who to add/drop/trade. Not that you have to act on anyone's advice but it may be helpful just seeing the type of logic people use when evaluating these players.

Best advice? Follow some fantasy baseball blogs. Should only take 10 minutes out of your morning just reading recaps of the night before. Great way to get used to the lingo, stay on top of current player trends. (Razzball.com is my favorite. Great analysis but also funny/well written).

For deeper analysis check out fangraphs.com. Take some time and search each of the guys on your team on their site, and usually there will be some current articles where they're mentioned. Great way to get to know the players on your team and get a gauge on what your expectations can be.

Good fortune! </TEXT>

This gives a pretty comprehensive explanation of the situation. It's unfortunate because if he was on any other team he'd be playing every day, the dodgers simply have too many talented players. 

The reason to be optimistic is that these guys are going to get injured as the season goes on, and there will be more opportunities for mattingly to squeeze him into the lineup.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This early in the season it's kind of hard to value guys, and an unfortunate consequence of that I find is that you can only really value them on the round they were drafted (as far as having a good shot of making an even trade). Let's say for arguments sake Tanaka got taken in round 6 of your draft; scope around who you drafted in rounds 5-8...if it's anyone you're willing to part with that the tanaka owner might want, give it a shot.

I realize you're asking for a specific list of players, it's just too broad a question for me to answer without knowing the context of the league/teams/scoring. </TEXT>
