	<TEXT> One of my best friends almost died from lupus. Her story is so sad. She is better now, but she has to be really careful lest flare-ups happen. She broke out in terrible hives when we were in Spain together and her throat almost closed up. It was really scary being in a country where none of us knew much of the language during a situation such as that. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The thesaurus is a great source! Any smartphone has a thesaurus in conjunction with the dictionary app. Type in a word, find something similar.  

My favorite word is "absolutely". It may seem silly and common, but the use of absolutely in place of "sure" or "no problem" comes of so much more eloquent. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Depression/suicide awareness. I feel like so many people are depressed but so few people have the tact or understanding to be a supportive friend to someone struggling with depression. So many people give advice but usually all someone wants is to *not* talk or think about their issues. That's what a therapist is for. We just want to be distracted as a way to be cheered up.  

Also, eating disorders. There isn't a whole lot of understanding with the kind of addiction and struggle that ED sufferers endure. A lot of people think it's about vanity when it very rarely is, or, if it started out that way, it never is the reason for persisting.  </TEXT>
