Unknown to many, but ratings are actually based on sample sizes, basically a small amount of Americans supposedly representing the larger population have boxes in their home that document viewing habits. If you don't have this box, or report by telephone, nothing you watch at home counts. </TEXT>

Saying that Gone With The Wind would have grossed $1 billion in today's dollars is wrong because it only broke records back in the day cause it played for years and it was one of very few movies available to watch. </TEXT>
