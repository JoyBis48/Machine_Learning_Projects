	<TEXT> Foreign Companies are growing the nations to serve their objective and sell them for the benefit of other countries. The goods produced aren't really used by the people in Africa themselves. They can use some of their wages to purchase some of the goods, but there isn't the full gains of trade. This method will take a long time for countries to actually develop into developed countries, but it still works. Hence, why the world's economy gets better each day throughout human history. It just depends on the rate of growth. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> America built an economy up until World War 2 with heavy tariffs, growing unions, and lots of exports. 

You can argue on either end of the spectrum. It seems like the problem is the trade deficit. It is not protectionism vs free-trade. A little more protectionism could reduce the deficit and in return increase exports. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Wouldn't it makes sense to reduce outsourcing incentivized first and increase competition in the markets so companies don't get as much profit to automate as quickly. Since we have an increase in small businesses, those businesses can't buy capital as fast as big businesses. Also a reduction in the labor supply by reducing the amount of new immigrant labor and an increase in unionization would push up wages as well. These should all go into effect before the min wage actually increases. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Driving in the United States has a very inelastic demand, so when prices increase by a certain %, the reduction in demand % falls less relative to the price % increase because most Americans live in areas without good public transit nor have jobs within walking distance. Hence, why people are so concerned when prices increase because it affects them a lot and can't change it. Some might get discouraged to drive as result of the gas prices increase. Those people will take public transit, which in turn increases ridership revenues via fares. Fare Increases in the MBTA to pay for the system itself would discourage and reduce ridership because city people can take taxis, walk to their jobs, carpool, buy a care, take UBER, etc. Most economists agree that raising the gas tax can be a very efficient policy.  

In Europe or other developed countries, Gas Prices are currently in many places 50% more or even double than our gas prices via very high gas taxes. Their roads and mass transit are better than ours.  </TEXT>

If I had to chose a player, it would be Finlay because he has done well last season. You could do Steve Clark, but people are hoping on Vancouevr attack to do well, so it might backfire.  </TEXT>
