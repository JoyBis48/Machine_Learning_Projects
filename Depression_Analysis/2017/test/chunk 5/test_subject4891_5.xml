	<TEXT>   I saw someone who did a speed modeling video where a guy modeled a gun based of an image which he had in the background really fast. He could chose a polygon and stretch it out in less than that of a second. I'm thinking he just uses keyboard shortcuts, for that's what people do in Blender speed modeling videos. So, what keyboard shortcuts do I use to do such? </TEXT>

	<TEXT>     I've worked on a few vidya games which was pretty cool, but I was completely sapped of creativity. We used CryEngine, and I realized how similar it looked to CGI movie effects. I started comparing films to video games.
   I asked myself, "How can a film be more interesting than a video game if a video game is so interactive and keeps the player on the edge of their seat?"
     Anyway, long story short, what are some nifty writing and editing tricks to keep the film vibrant, exciting, and interesting? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Voxel farm is a Voxel engine. You make shit out of billions of tiny voxels. The more voxels, the better and more round a model can be. This is supposed to solve the problem of games not being able to render enough polygons. 
  With voxels, you can have unlimited detail, and according to Euclidean, not have to worry about hardware specs.
   So I'm trying to find an equally good Voxel engine without jew prices. </TEXT>
