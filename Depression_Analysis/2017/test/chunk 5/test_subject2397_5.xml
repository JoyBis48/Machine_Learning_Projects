	<TEXT> Okay, I'm just going to ask this.
Do you really want to come back from this? - 

What's that supposed to mean? - 

Architecture is killing you, Ted, and it's killing us to watch it killing you.
You're like that goat with the washcloth.
You want it so bad, and every time the world tries to take it away from you, you keep grabbing it.
But you know what? It's just a washcloth.
Why do you even want it?

 Because I have to be an architect.
That's That's the plan.

Screw the plan.
I planned on being a famous artist.
Marshall planned on being an environmental lawyer.
Robin planned on being a TV reporter.

Found it </TEXT>

	<TEXT> She basically tells Ted to quit as an architect and just give up on everything he's worked for, saying it's killing him and killing them watching it kill him. She also compared his career to the rag that the goat was eating saying "why do you even want it so badly". To me it just seemed so anti-himym advice.

I don't really like Ted's answer though saying "that's the plan". It's not just the plan to him it's what he loves doing and I wish he had said that instead </TEXT>
