	<TEXT> This actually happened with my old phone and the way I fixed it was by getting a hairdryer on low heat and blowing full speed into the jack for a few minutes. It actually worked! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you for the feedback! I'm so glad you like the eyes! I'm normally not very creative with my eyeshadow and just wear a single colour if any at all,  so this was very new for me.  I tried very hard with the eyebrows but it was really hard as naturally my brows are very thick and bold (they were glued down and hidden under layers  of concealer!) and you're totally right about the cat eye,  I just got a wee bit carried away :p </TEXT>
