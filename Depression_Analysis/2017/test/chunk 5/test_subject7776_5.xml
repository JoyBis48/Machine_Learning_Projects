	<TEXT> I got an email a few days ago saying I signed up for it. The thing is, I've never touched anything to do with BitCoins, and I went to look at what it meant and it had my name, first, middle, and last. It also had my birthday almost to the exact everything, but was off by 1 day. They also had my email. So I went in and changed everything, thankfully they didn't have any proof of ID, so it wasn't a full active account. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> no problem!

edit: found the comment I was talking about

"After reading about the chrome and paint coming off, I decided to spray a couple layers of clear coat on them. Made them shine a little more and no peel over time.
Over 12 months installed. Maybe 6 on the road and out of the garage."

Thats if you just want to replace it completely, which might be the best option.

Also a comment that might be important to you (found in the comments on the item): After reading about the chrome and paint coming off, I decided to spray a couple layers of clear coat on them. Made them shine a little more and no peel over time.
Over 12 months installed. Maybe 6 on the road and out of the garage.

P.S. : Nice GT man. </TEXT>
