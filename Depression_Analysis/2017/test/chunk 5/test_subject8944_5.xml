	<TEXT> Well damn. All right, let's do a breakdown. You have $1000, plus $400 on Amazon. Do you mind saying what city you live in? You need to be in a place with good public transportation (even if you get the car, b/c gas is expensive), that is cheap, and has jobs.

Step 0) Sell everything you don't need. This includes the guitar, excess clothes, everything. If you absolutely cannot part with stuff you cannot carry on your back, you need to find one of those storage rental places that gives you your first month for $1 or some great deal like that. But be careful not to sign a contract for longer than that period. If you end up needing longer than the month, 

1) Do you have a laptop? If so, you need to find places with free wifi. Usually McDonalds have free wifi so look there first.

2) Get a library card to waste time, read, and use their computers.

3) The $400 on Amazon is now your food money. They have Amazon lockers that you can get your items shipped to so you don't need an address. Buy small items that can fit in your backpack, and shop cheap.

4) Join a gym. Usually YMCA will give you a membership based on income. Check there first. This is now where you shower, shave, etc.

5) If you don't get the car, you need a place to sleep. Homeless shelters can probably be nasty and dangerous. If I were you, I would buy just an absolute junker of a car off Craigslist to at least sleep in. You can probably get one for $300. If you don't want to do that, start researching nearby shelters. I hear Walmarts are good at letting people sleep in their parking lots, but don't take that to the bank. Otherwise try to find deserted areas that don't look too dangerous. Warning: Don't sleep in the storage locker listed above. It's probably illegal and there are all sorts of dangers of freezing/heating to death, not to mention lack of oxygen if its airtight, etc.

6) Do you have a cell phone? Will your mom continue to pay for the plan? If not, then go buy one of those cheap phones with the pay as you go minutes and only buy the minimum and never text anyone. This is strictly for work contacts.

7) You need an address to put on job applications and where you can receive mail. Buy a PO Box from UPS. They have ones that look like real street addresses (http://www.theupsstore.com/mailboxes/Pages/personal.aspx).

8) Now you have all your immediate needs out of the way. And honestly all the above steps shouldn't take you more than 2 days. Now you start job searching. Apply everywhere. You cannot discriminate. It's already likely going to be 2-3 weeks before your first paycheck arrives. Fastfood places generally have high turnover. Put on a button-up shirt if you have one and make your hair look good. You walk in and ask if the hiring manager is working and tell them you'd like to apply. Another good place to apply would be CVS or Walgreens, basically small drug stores. They also generally have high turnover. And this is actually a good time to be applying. There's not a lot of competition from high school/ college students like there is in summer.

9) After you get a job, you want to get a place. Don't waste time finding an apartment you can't afford right now. Go find a rent a room situation on Craigslist. Shouldn't be more than $500 including all bills. And make sure its a month-to-month situation.

10) Now you can start looking at community colleges. I'd start with 1-3 classes you can take when you're not working. Seriously, college goes faster than you know. Think of it as 40 classes. That's all you need to graduate from a 4 year college. Or even start looking at trade professions your community college may offer if you're interested. You already applied to FAFSA, great!! Take any aid offered. Aim to start this summer! You'll be done in just a few years. If you want to transfer to a 4 year college, do your first 60 credits (20 classes at community college) before you transfer. If you take 3 classes each term, and don't skip summers, you'll be done in 2 years + 1 semester. That can be your Associate Degree or your step to transfer to a Bachelors.


While my situation wasn't as dire as yours, I went through something similar, getting kicked out, on 1 weeks notice, when I was 18 and still in high school. I ended up working and taking community college classes for some years before transferring to a 4 year school and graduating with a double major. I'm now on a full scholarship to law school with a fiance and a cat. I'm telling you this so you can see there's a light at the end of the tunnel. It will get better if you put in the effort. Feel free to respond on here or PM me if you have any other questions.


EDIT: Just saw you lived in rural Pennsylvania. That can't work. You need to get to the closest big city. It looks like Philadelphia is the biggest city in Pennsylvania by a lot. So you need to get there before any of these steps can happen. Try to get a ride from your mom since she's moving, but if not you need to use a tiny bit of your money to buy a bus ticket there.

EDIT 2: Just saw someone from Philadelphia say the job market sucks there. I looked up the lowest unemployment rates in the US and Salt Lake City, Utah is at the top with an unemployment rate of only 3.5%. But they have a very small population. The city on the list with the highest population and lowest unemployment rate is Minneapolis, Minnesota or Austin, Texas. I looked at a Greyhound ticket and they're $108 from Philadelphia to Minneapolis or $139 to Austin. They are both big cities with low unemployment rates under 5%. </TEXT>

I'm not a huge proponent of the military, but you are low on options and they will provide you with food, housing, medical, salary and seemingly most important to you, some structure in life.

Plus you can learn a skill that might be applicable when you get out. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I assumed it would be unranked schools, but it's Iowa (27th) and SUNY Buffalo (100th to be fair).

The article suggests this is the ABA no longer requiring the LSAT for up to 10% of each school's entering class and that more schools will soon follow. Article also suggests that schools will likely lobby the ABA for an even higher percentage of students to be allowed in without LSAT scores.

This is all due to dropping enrollment, which dropped another 7% from last year.

The schools will require the students' SAT/ACT, GRE, GMAT, or other standardized college scores in place of the LSAT. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Help please, I filed my taxes last January and never received my refund, what number can I call? </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I filed my taxes in January 2014 for the 2013 tax year. My refund never came and when I went to Where's My Refund, it said it was still "in process" or something along those lines. After 10 weeks or so, I figured I got audited but I had nothing to worry about. In June, I called up the IRS (forgot what number I called or how I found it) and was told that they were indeed auditing me and that they would contact me before August. That came and went with no contact from them, and I got busy with school. Well now it's January and I need to file this years return but I kinda want to know the status on last years return (and get my refund).

So when I got on Where's My Refund now, it thinks I'm entering for tax year 2014 and doesn't work anymore. And if I call the (800) 829-1040 number I found, it keeps prompting me for SSN, refund amount and filing status, but when I enter those it asks when I filed my tax return, either before January 5th, 2015 or after. When I select before, it just says they haven't processed those yet, but obviously they're thinking of this years tax return and I'm thinking of last years.

Please can someone point me in the right direction? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I mean I get that, but in the article it says Peyton's earned $230MM. I don't follow Peyton's life too much, but I'm sure he lives in a house he's probably paid $20MM or so for, and lives on mayyyybbee $1MM or so each year he's been in the league. After accounting for taxes, which should be about 40% or so, that leaves him with a little over $100MM left, assuming he had no investments whatsoever. Now what in the world would PFM want to buy that he could with $120MM but not $100MM. It just makes no sense. I mean if he invested in US Bonds, yielding some of the lowest interest rates, he'd be nearly guaranteed $2MM each year for the rest of his life.

tl;dr: If he comes back, it's not for the money. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What do you think Peyton would want right now that he can't afford but an extra $19MM will allow him to afford and is worth the risk of another severe injury?

If I had as much money as him, I would retire yesterday from a sport as dangerous as his. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A couple things to note. 1) Johny was injured when Lawler was climbing his way back up so an immediate rematch wasn't possible. 2) A contender losing and getting the rematch is pretty unprecedented (only happened with Shogun/Machida), whereas a champion losing and getting an immediate rematch happens all the time and is even more justified because the result was controversial


For the record I disagree with the rematch. I think Rory should get the fight. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sorry to hijack here, but I just saw Foxcatcher tonight where Channing Tatum is a wrestler and the weigh ins happens, and the dude telling Channing he's 12 pounds over. Mark Ruffalo asks dude how much time they have and he says 90 minutes. I started busting out laughing cause the next scene is Channing biking his ass off on a stationary with a sweatshirt on, and apparently he makes weight cause it shows him fighting the next scene. No idea if that part was based on a real story but it was unreal.

Point being, if that wrestler could do it, Nate could. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That actually brings up a very interesting point. Like right now, if you have a fight coming up in the next 3-4 months its whatever, you'll fight either way. But if they try to schedule you for an event in May/June, would you just get "injured" and not be able to fight until July? I mean really, how many sponsors are gonna stick around until the very last minute? It just makes sense to try to delay at that point. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I still stand by my statement than anyone with multiple MVP seasons is a HOFer. I don't care if they only played 2 seasons. I think that alone deserves HOF, but I realize people will disagree with me.

Also, a SB win, SB MVP, and 3 SB appearances. I mean that's better than 99% of all QB's. I definitely feel Warner has earned HOF.


Edit: Let me give you a hypothetical because I'm curious. Say a QB came into the league and had most yards ever in a season, highest completion percentage ever, most TD's in a season, least INTs ever in a season, lead his team to a perfect record and won SB MVP. Then the next season he had identical stats and record, but promptly retired after those 2 seasons. Would you think he deserved HOF then? </TEXT>

Also, Warner is looking like a first ballot HOFer, so I don't see how that's a good argument. Yes, there's argument, but if he doesn't make this cut, he'll almost surely be in within the next few years. </TEXT>
