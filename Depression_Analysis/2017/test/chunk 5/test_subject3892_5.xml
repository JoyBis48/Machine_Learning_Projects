	<TEXT> I read it years ago, re-read a few (less) years ago, and just re-read it for a third time this year. Truth is, each time was a different experience. There's no question that Vonnegut was a cynical, depressing, misanthropic human being, but I think this book oozes with more of it than any other i can remember.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm actually sitting in front of a stack of books right now I tagged with BookCrossing.com labels. I'm taking them with me this weekend and dropping them off at various ice cream and coffee shops I plan to hit. 

I first heard of this site about 5 years ago when I found a random Agatha Christie book sitting on a bench outside a CVS in Pennsylvania. Can't say I've participated enough, but I love the idea.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Agreed. Just crossed the 300 page mark. Couldn't agree more. And normally I feel like I'm pretty good at picking up on subtleties like, "Oh OK, yeah, it's that guy's kid," or...you know...but when we find out about Hassan's origins and the guy with "John Lennon glasses," I was definitely caught off guard. 

So long as the ending isn't going to let me down, I can see this easily being a 4 or 4.5 star review. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The thing I like the most about sci-fi is in trying to imagine the unimaginable. For example, if Stephen King spends seven sentences describing a door to a hotel room, we get it. It's a door. We've seen millions of them and, save for the occasional little detail that an author may WANT us to see, a door is a door.

But when there is a planet, or a spaceship, or a spacesuit, or some sort of weapon - maybe a breathing apparatus - or a creature, or a species or a race or ANYTHING that doesn't exist, the author has to raise the bar a bit and help us envision these things. And there is a little beauty in that too. Again, we all know what a door looks like. But if an author describes a ship in such a way that we can get a bit of an outline, it's up to the reader to color it in. Maybe we pull from a movie we've seen or anther book we've read - or maybe we're forced to imagine something we've never considered. 

A door is a door to every reader, but I'd argue the world of sci-fi allows for the chance that 1,000 readers can perceive a spaceship in 1,000 totally different ways. 

Just my two cents.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Perhaps you can join a book club? Maybe, like myself, it helps if it feels more like an "assignment" then just something you do in your leisure.

I applied a similar approach a few years back when I was just in an overall rut in work/life/etc. I joined a creative writing group, a book group that met up weekly (or if I couldn't make it, online forum) and just tried to exercise a different part of my mind. Similar to yourself, I was a voracious reader when I was younger, but it tapered off significantly in college. Now, I find myself in the unenviable position of commuting on a bus one hour each to work, so I tend to invest that time wisely in reading pretty much everything I can get my hands on. And on those days when I'm just not feeling it, I let my head hit the window and pass out for a few minutes. :-)  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's kinda sad to see him talk about how happy he "was" when he was 16/17. Dude was 21, heavyweight champ of the world, and he's talking like a guy who is 50 years old looking back on his teenage days. 

He was amazing to watch no doubt, but damn, he was forced to grow up fast.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is on my short list of books I read in one day. Once I started it I couldn't put it down. I recall starting somewhere around 10am on a day during the summer and finishing right before dinner. It was the first one of his I'd ever read.

Went right back to the library, returned it, and proceeded to take out: Misery, The Shining and Salem's Lot.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> **The Kite Runner, by Khaled Hosseini**

One of the many books I've had sitting around for a while that I said I would eventually get to. I'm 180 pages in and I'm mixed with equal parts hatred and sympathy for the protagonist.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Samuel L Jackson. Everything is Samuel L. Jackson.

But really, whenever I see the movie and then read the book, the narrator is the actor from the movie. unfortunately this also holds true to other instances like Jack Nicholson in The Shining. No matter how hard I tried I couldn't picture someone other than him, King's description be damned.  </TEXT>
