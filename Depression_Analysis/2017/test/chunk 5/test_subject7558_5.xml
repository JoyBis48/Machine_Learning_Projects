	<TEXT> Well. You could try lowering your dose little by little and see if those effects go away. You could also try switching strains, or your vendor. I take 5-6 grams three times a day and have never had any problems like that. Everybody's different though. Strain/vendor switch would probably be worth a try if you haven't already. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> "i was talking about grammer". I know bro, I was talking about grammar too. Did you mean to say "wasn't" instead of "was"? You somehow just made yourself into a great example, supporting my earlier reference to your grammar. Speaking of English classes, you should go see if a professor will pay you to be a case study. A lot can be learned by attempting to read the trainwreck nonsense you type up. I NEVER point out people's grammatical errors. I'm far from a grammar nazi. I just couldn't help pointing out your ironic statement. TL;DR You're lucky I don't know you personally or I'd come FISTFUCK YOU IN THE COCKSUCKER. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ok well I've taken single strains by themselves only about 102746 times, and it never gets me to where I want to be no matter what. Mixing Green Bali with reds is what does it for me. I wouldn't even be taking kratom if I wasn't mixing them the way I do because it wouldn't have the effect I'm looking for. I wasn't asking why I'm not satisfied, I'm asking if anybody else notices the same thing when they first try a new strain. The same thing happened to me with RVS, RVB, RVT, and RV Hulu Kapuas... I took them twice to begin with and didn't feel much, and then after that they started working great. Also, I don't mean to be a dick either, but I find it strange you think I sound like a kid when I'm the one who uses correct grammar, and you can't even be bothered to spell out the word "you". Either way, thanks for the advice. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Alright alright alright. So I usually take 5-6 grams of Red Vein Sumatran/Green Bali mixed at a 2:1 ratio, respectively. I do this before work in the morning, and then after work in the late afternoon. Then at about 8 I dose one more time, except I substitute Red Vein Thai for the RVS. I do that just for kicks, mostly. Well, the time came to order some more Green Bali, and I decided to cop a 25 gram sack of that Maha Kali everybody keeps going on and on about. Well, the shit came today. I just got home and jammed 6ish grams down my cocksucker, same mixture ratio as usual but using Maha Kali in place of the RVS. A half hour or so has past, and by now, I would usually be feeling great. But at this point I'm actually regretting not taking my usual RVS. I definitely always feel better than this by now. However... I've noticed in the past that the first one or two times I take a new strain, it doesn't seem to do much for me. I'm hoping that's the situation here. Does anybody else notice that happening to them? </TEXT>

It's sort of stop and go sometimes, and I love using my smartphone on the toilet so much, that I always piss sitting down too. I end up spending like 10 minutes on the toilet every time I piss, and my bitch always ends up yellin at me. She thinks I jerk it in there. Sometimes I do jerk it, though, if it's been long enough since my last dose. Toilet jerks are one of life's greatest simple pleasures. </TEXT>
