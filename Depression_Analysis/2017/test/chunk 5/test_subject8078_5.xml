I have a filer list that I haven't messed with in a long while.  But today, after redditing on All/Top, I had a Trees then Atheism post pop through (Both on my filter list).  Now many others on my list are showing up.

I've restarted Chome, but the same thing occurs. 

Thanks! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I guess mine is magical.

But the reason for the post is to give an option on buying a suit (or nice clothes in general) that might be a little too large.  But save money, because it is on sale.  

You shouldn't go buy something more than 1 or 2 sizes too large.  Anything larger and your tailor might not be able to help.  And the price to tailor might reach the breakpoint price.  And even then, you can take it too the tailor and let them look at it.  If they can't help you, return the clothes.   </TEXT>

Dayton is in the Football Championship Subdivision.  Division I (your top level) is subdivided into two subdivisions: Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) and Football Championship Subdivision (FCS).  

FBS has your more well known teams. 

So Dayton plays at the 2nd highest level of collegiate football.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Learn to love your local Tailor </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-10-14 16:11:22 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> The key for a good looking suit, is to get a tailor to do his magic on it.

They can also tailor suits that wouldn't fit otherwise.

Let me give you an example.

I recently bought a Brooks Brothers suit for 70% off.  It ended up being around $90 total.  But it was a couple of sizes too large for me.  So I brought it to my local tailor. $80 later, I had a suit that fits/looks good.  The only reason it was $80, was because it was A LOT bigger than what I needed.  I took another suit that was closer to my size and only spent $50. 

So I paid $90+$80 for a $300 suit.  

This is ESPECIALLY good for the normal sized people out there.  It always seems like the clearance rack is full of plus sized clothes.  

--------

They also have repaired numerous things (backpacks etc), cheaply as well.  

It never hurts to buy something and take it by the Tailor and see what they can do.  At worse, you'll have to return the item.   </TEXT>

Because if an undefeated Marshall gets in with their SOS, then every team will start to schedule down.

	<TEXT> Are you the owner of this website?  If so, I have a few suggestions. 

* If you choose a certain division, repopulate the conference list with conferences on in that division.

* Have the ability to make each conference a different color, so people can compare schools/conferences.

* Have the ability to choose multiple divisions/conferences to display at once.  </TEXT>
