	<TEXT> While we're on the subject about your tampon keeping you from sleeping, you're going to have your head on a square that keeps repeating "pillow pillow pillow" and your going to have a blanket on top of you saying "blanket blanket blanket" and for that matter you will have a bed repeating its own name. So something like "pillow bed tampon blanket pillow bed tampon blanket" etc etc... Tl;dr
There is no escape.  </TEXT>
