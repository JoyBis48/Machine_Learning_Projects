	<TEXT> It boggles me how people from Western cultures are so tolerant with an outdated culture that doesn't even respect human rights. Swedes really need to open their eyes, because once the 3rd world immigrants are there doing bad stuff, there won't be an easy way to revert the situation. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah I got that problem a few times lately and only a reboot would fix it. So I installed the DirectX on the BF4 redist folder and so far so good. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It wasn't just based on the poorly optimized crap Watch Dogs is. I play BF4 a lot and there were some AMD-related memory leaks that were never fixed, and the game crashed if I tried enabling MSAA. Not to mention AC Unity and Far Cry 4 are coming out soon :) </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Was buying a GTX 760 a mistake? </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I had an old HD5850 from when I built my PC in late 2009.  It was starting to suck on games like Watch Dogs and 1-2 months ago I decided to get a MSI GTX 760 Twin Frozr 2gb for 234 (cheapest I could find). 

Should I have waited for a price drop and got the 770?
Will this card + my i7 920 @stock still run games in medium 1080p 60fps in 2-3 years? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> What's the best lesson you learned from your grandfather? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-09-28 21:28:10 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> My grandfather once told me something I consider to be incredibly useful and valuable to me.
It was a story, back from the old days when he worked. His workplace had a cafeteria, which sometimes had a full stock of food and beverages. Certain greedy workers noticed this and started taking them home and/or wasting them. And of course, after a while, there weren't enough food and beverages.
 "If we use our resources slowly, they'll always be enough.
 But if we get greedy and abuse them, they'll never be enough".

Fortunately he's still alive, but since he's 81, I fear it won't be for long :(

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> A woman pregnant with triplets was a victim in a robbery, and was shot 3 times in the belly. She went to the doctor and he said although the bullets reached the triplets, it wasn't in a critical zone, and eventually the bullets would come out their bodies. 2 healthy girls and a boy were born.

After 12 years, one of the girls was peeing, when she peed the bullet.

- "Mommy, some metal thing just came out of me" - she said.
So, mom explained to her what had happened when she was pregnant.
A week after that, the other girl was peeing, the same thing happened, and the mom explained it again.

After another week, the boy was in the bathroom and calls his mom.

- "Mom, you won't believe what just happened!" - he screamed.

- "It's OK son, you just peed some metal thing, wasn't it?" - she replied.

- "What? No! I was masturbating here in the bathroom when suddenly our dog died". </TEXT>

	<TITLE> I don't want the next Battlefield to be futuristic </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-09-11 02:04:54 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm rather new to the Battlefield universe. I've only played BF3 (singleplayer) and BF4 (singleplayer + 400 hours of multiplayer) and I like the fact they offer modern warfare, but not futuristic (at least, not that much until Final Stand).
I just don't care for futuristic games with robots and super galactic weapons and stuff like that. I think Titanfall and COD are already enough when it comes to this matter, despite their differences to Battlefield. 

Then again, I might be wrong. I didn't play BF2142 after all. What's your opinion? </TEXT>
