These look like garbage. Put your clipper on low, and train your dog proper. Use a cell phone on vibrate. A back massager. An electric tooth brush. Work up to a clipper on low without using it, just having it on. Baby steps.

Sorry to sound so harsh, but this isn't the victorian age, my dear.

Edit: I have ONCE seen these on a dog grooming group, but no one even used them. They are antiques from a bygone era.

	<TEXT> YES it's called a [miracle brush](http://www.amazon.com/Miracle-Coat-Slicker-Brush-Large/dp/B000QFQFTY), buy this, it will make your life better.

Also, while you're at it, invest in a greyhound comb. It has two sides. Use the wide toothed side to find matts, which you shave out with a clipper with a #10 blade. The fine toothed side will be used to check your work. DO NOT USE THIS TO DEMATT. Also, DON'T USE SCISSORS TO DEMATT. (I yelled this, I actually yelled this).

Next, for double coated dogs, i use a [Furminator](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0040QQ07C/ref=amb_link_411281542_2?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER pf_rd_s=center-3 pf_rd_r=1Z56KSWBNPYGAMPQEFR2 pf_rd_t=101 pf_rd_p=1776751902 pf_rd_i=1296335011) and a [Zoom Groom](http://www.amazon.com/Dog-Zoom-Groom-Choose-color/dp/B000RGKU7K). Furminator is a blade. Don't do the same area for too long, your dog will get skin irritation. It gets out the undercoat. The zoom groom is good for top coat, and the dogs love how it feels.

Hope some of this helps.

I would also look in to mobil groomers to come to your house. You may have to drop $100, but it'll be worth it. Promise. We professionals know best. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Gazelle sighthounds are found all across the middle east and northern Africa. The Indian Gazelle hound,  the Saluki, the Afghan hound, even the island hounds of the Mediterranean like the Ibizan hound. Iran wouldn't surprise me as the origin of such domestication, but the greater differentiation is attributed to the northern Africans. </TEXT>

Think about it this way. 5 people are bigger than 1 person, or higher. This group of 5 people is a bigger 'thing' than yourself. This belief in the bigger group than yourself can be powerful. Group mentality. Faith in something bigger than yourself. It isn't a God, isn't a bunch of Gods, it's a bunch of people. I have faith in a bunch of people, because collectively they are my higher power.  </TEXT>
