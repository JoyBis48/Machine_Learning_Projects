	<TEXT> Flagging sucks. Standing all day makes for an incredibly long and boring day. It's not like you can play on your phone to pass the time, and you're most always alone and away from others, so there's no idle chatting. Stand all day on the hard road and you're quickly hitting the store for better boot insoles, because your feet ache at the end of the day. 

Then there are the idiots driving. They're safe in their cars, so any thoughts of zipping close by anyone working on the road doesn't  bring any thoughts of safety to their minds. Suits and mommies chatting on their phones are the worst. They have places to be and you, you asswipe, are fucking up their day. How dare you, don't you know how important they are? You turn your sign to let them by, and off they go to try to make up as much time as possible. It's downright scary sometimes how they'll gun it to catch up to the line to get by before you turn the sign.

Fuck flagging, you couldn't pay me enough to ever do that again.

	<TEXT> First off, it's completely against reddiquette you should be downvoted for this: fuck fanboys. 

Secondly, I had the same problem until I installed VLC and all the codecs. It must use those codecs, because suddenly it played everything. I just save new movies with plain names, and use Filebot to rename my shows. The rare instances it won't see the correct show is fixed pretty easily. Doctor Who (2005) is constantly misread, for instance, but quickly fixed manually.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It just pisses me off that itunes has me add folder to library, then links behaviors after that. It clearly distinguishes between the folder and the library, but deleted the folder with no warning. I only wanted to delete the itunes library.

	<TEXT> The warning says nothing about the original files being deleted. I'm looking at it right now. It says "Are you sure you want to delete the selected songs from your iTunes library? These songs will also be deleted from any iPod, iPhone, or iPad that synchronizes with your iTunes library." If the library and folder containing the music are considered the same thing, why do I need to load them in manually? Why doesn't itunes see them on start up?

edit: So, this response, which is correct, is downvoted, but what I'm responding to is upvoted even though it's incorrect? Yay for reddit, I guess. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My daughter went with an iphone, so we ended up putting all our music in our itunes folder, then adding it to my library. Things were all messed up (tag wise) so I spent half the day fixing and adding tags. When everything was all good, I wiped my itunes library to reload the folder. Apparently it doesn't just wipe my library, it wipes my music folder as well. When trying to delete the songs from my library, I get a warning that it will wipe the library, ipod, iphone, or ipad. NOTHING SAYS THAT MY MUSIC FOLDER WILL BE DELETED. If my itunes library was the same thing as my music folder, I wouldn't have to manually add music from the folder to the itunes library. Thousands of songs, gone. Years worth. I've undeleted with Recuva as much as possible, but tons are gone from restoring what I could from the recycle bin, which wasn't nearly large enough to hold all my files. Songs I didn't get from apple, so there's no replacing them. Some I may be able to redownload, but I'm basically forced to pirate music now, since I'm positive apple isn't about to replace anything I didn't buy from them. Gonna uninstall itunes, go with a 3rd party app, and never get another apple product again. What a huge, giant FU from apple. Well, right back atcha, guys.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ah, scraping, I get it now. I use Filebot to rename all my shows, rename movies myself, and let Plex sort it all out. I've noticed it's gotten better at figuring things out these days. Doctor Who (2005) seems to want to be renamed, but "fix incorrect" takes care of that. Oh, and Harry Potter 7 parts 1 and 2 gave me a hell of a time. Had to throw them into their own folder before they would split. Weird.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Pretty obvious you haven't got much experience with the real drug world. Innocents suffer every day due to the whole mess. Not everyone gets a choice whether or not they associate with them, and often times are completely unaware they are. My sister's best friend in school was killed because her father was in it. She had no idea about anything. 

And war, as horrible as I believe it to be, is the natural state of affairs. Has there ever been a time in history when it wasn't? Are they all necessary? No. The Iraq war wasn't, I think. But when groups like ISIS or the Nazis rise up, evil will only triumph when good men do nothing. Did more people die in WWII than would have died had Hitler had gone unchecked? 

But all that stuff aside, I still would prefer a children's toy store didn't sell drug dealer toys.  </TEXT>
