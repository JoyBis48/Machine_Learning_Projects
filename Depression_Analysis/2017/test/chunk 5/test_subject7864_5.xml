	<TEXT> video games are highly addictive because they are psychologically gratifying--as in, you get immediate rewards and feedback constantly. to state that just because someone of one gender is immune to this mental response is unfortunately misplaced sexism. this means, if properly exposed, any girl can like games. So "hot or not" is on a case-by-case basis, just like it would be with any male gamer, which as it is easy to imagine represent all ends of the aesthetic spectrum.

	<TEXT> thanks, you rock. My game plan is basically to fly out 4 - 5 days before I start work and schedule in a bunch of walk throughs for then. Is that an unreasonable time frame in seattle? I have relocation funds from my company + plenty of friends who I could crash with if I end up needing extra time. </TEXT>
