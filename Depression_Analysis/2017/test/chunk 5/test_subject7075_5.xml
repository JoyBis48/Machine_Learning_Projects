	<TEXT> So I just purchased a vintage Peugeot SuperSport road bike. Everything is original and in great condition given its age. I took it on a test drive around the neighborhood and noticed the brakes squeal when applied and the shifting is a bit clunky. It utilizes the older, lever-style shifters that I am unfamiliar with. I am used to riding mountain bikes and decided to switch it up and use it to travel around town. 

Being that the bike isn't new - what sort of maintenance should I perform to get it to tip-top shape? </TEXT>
