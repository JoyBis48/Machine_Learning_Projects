I don't do it in a malicious or mean way, I'm just genuinely concerned and don't want my SO to be upset, but I just come on a little bit strong. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I know it's not something people can just "get over" because it's an actual personality trait. But I am really introverted and I feel like it holds me back a lot. Like, I'm in robotics and marching band and sometimes I feel so alone and like I'm an outcast, then I realize it's my own fault. I'm terrified to talk to people, and when I do it's incredibly awkward. I have friends that I can be myself around, but lately I've been pushing them all away. I never feel like hanging out or texting them. I just want to sit in my room alone and listen to music or read all the time, and I know that's not how I should be spending my time. I should be out having fun with my friends, but I just don't feel like it. I know I'll never be perfect at socializing and having friends, but I really need ways to stop the antisocial and extremely introverted tendencies I have. Does anyone have any advice? I'm so done with being alone all the time because I don't know how to socialize. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It depends on what she's into, but my (now ex) boyfriend wanted to take me to homecoming really badly this year but I was really opposed to it, as I hate big dances and large gatherings of hormone-filled teenagers in the same room. So we just agreed that we would go out for a nice dinner then go back to his house. He knew I always liked just cuddling on the couch watching a movie better than going out somewhere. Then when he drove me home from dinner he went in the house first and told me to wait a second and that he would text me when I could come in, because he had a surprise. Then when I came in there was this song playing that we always listened to together and he was wearing a nice suit and he just grabbed me and started dancing with me. It was super nice and made me feel like I wasn't missing out. If your girlfriend is into cheesy romantic stuff like that then she might like being surprised with her own little "mini-prom" from you. Really though, it takes the right kind of person to enjoy it. </TEXT>

And every time he woke up, he said he wanted to die. He woke up for good, and he has some issues now but he's almost back to normal. When he was telling me about it, he said that if assisted suicide was an option, he would have jumped on it in a second just because he was in pain and was upset just at the time. He still has depression and isn't in the best state, but he isn't suicidal anymore. He said he's so glad that he didn't end up dying. Miracles like that happen. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm currently a sophomore in high school, but if I play my cards right, I'll be able to graduate as a junior. I realized how much I needed to begin looking at colleges. I want to be a chemist for sure, so my mom told me that MTU is a good school for students studying the sciences, but I had it in my head that it was based mainly on engineering. MTU has been one of my top choices since I started researching colleges more, but my question is how much they focus on the sciences, mainly chemistry. Thank you! </TEXT>
