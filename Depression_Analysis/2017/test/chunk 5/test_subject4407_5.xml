	<TEXT> A prolific writer does not wait for inspiration; he looks for it.  For as long as he has senses and, of course, the brain to process everything that he sees, hears, tastes, touches, and smells, he would always have something to write.  Once you feel that you can already begin trying your hand at scripts, watch plenty of movies, especially those known for good screenplay. Observe how the dialogues are made. Put your focus on the lines of the actors. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Nick Finer, a specialist in obesity medicine at UCL, said the work was potentially of great importance to our basic understanding of how energy intake is balanced by energy expenditure, and potentially as to why this system is mismatched in those who gain  or lose  excessive weight.

In the long-term it also offers a new approach to potential treatment of human obesity. Mice, however, are not human and much work is still needed to see if the effects of fexaramine are the same in humans and to establish its safety. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The solar inverters are a crucial part of the solar power energy system that is used by the photovoltaic arrays.  A solar inverter or PV inverter is a type of electrical inverter that changes the direct current (DC) electricity from photovoltaic array to alternating current (AC). The alternating current or AC is the type of electricity that we use to run our home appliances. Using alternating current usually requires transformers, switch or control circuits. Solar inverters usually use special procedures, so that it can deal with the PV array that includes maximum power point tracking and anti-islanding protection. </TEXT>
