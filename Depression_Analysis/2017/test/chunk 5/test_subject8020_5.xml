	<TEXT> Interesting that women are more sexually aroused at the idea of rape then men. Kinda scary also. 

Edit: as a fellow redditor pointed out, I guess a better adjective to describe this conundrum would be confusing. Women are more sexually aroused by "rape" however it's more of the characteristics of a legitimate rape that they like. Being dominated, forceful, etc.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm a liability adjuster for a large insurance company and I deal with disputes like this every day. That's why we get as much evidence as we can from both sides. In this case, if I received this video I would just deny liability (if she was a claimant and OP was our policyholder). At best, she could deny liability as well and her insurance company could pursue arbitration. However, once the arbiter receives video evidence that clearly puts her at fault, her insurance company would just write it off as a loss. You can't really charge her with anything because she legitimately may think she wasn't at fault. Criminal charges and investigation by the state attorney General generally occur if she was claiming an accident happened at 'x' time without a police report or any witnesses or evidence to support her claim.

Edit: Also, liability and determining who is at fault in an auto accident is more of a civil issue. Therefore nothing could really be filed against her. </TEXT>
