	<TEXT> There is no such thing as "Reverse Discrimination", yes sometime black, hispanic or asian people discriminate against white people, but that is simply discrimination, not "Reverse Discrimination". The opposite of discrimination would be when someone doesn't discriminate against anyone. There is no such thing as reverse racism or reverse prejudice either. Using terms like "reverse discrimination" supports the racist myth that only white people can discriminate or be prejudice.   </TEXT>
