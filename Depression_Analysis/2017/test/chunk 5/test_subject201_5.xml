Damn that thing was expensive but I love her and I think its her all time favorite thing. She is sad she has to wait a few weeks for the swelling to go down before she can get it fixed and sized. She defiantly couldn't wait 40 years haha.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If they cut the ring off at the ER do you think the ring can still be sized and come out of it looking fine? or does it really screw it up. She has 3 expensive rings soldered together and She wont do anything that will screw up the ring permanently unlessl she was gonna loose a finger or something. Its not bad like that tho.

	<TEXT> Well the swelling went down yesterday after we tried just pulling it off with dish soap. The swelling went down that night then tonight we tried the Floss trick and that almost worked but it made her finger swell up even worse. But we will take your advice tho. If it goes numb, looses feeling, or stays swelled we will go to the ER. Thanks for the help! </TEXT>
