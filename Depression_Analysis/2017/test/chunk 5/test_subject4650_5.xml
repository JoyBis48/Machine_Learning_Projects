	<TEXT> As a motorcyclist, it's extraordinary just how much you can feel the difference when you get right up the bum of a truck. I've used it as a technique to squeeze the last few miles out of a low fuel warning, you need almost no power once you're in the draft.

Having said that, I've been playing with an adaptive cruise system lately in a test car, and that seems significantly less fuel efficient than the way I'd drive if I was operating the pedals. It slows down and speeds up quite aggressively to maintain the distance you choose from the car in front. I'd guess that early self driving cars, before they begin talking to one another, will be less energy efficient than fuel-conscious human drivers. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> On the bike, it's a Sena 20S headset (SMH10 would be almost as good and cheaper), through a GP10 backpack thingy for the GoPro. Wind noise is cancelled to virtually zero, and the audio is synced straight up with the vision. You can also record intercom conversations if you're out with multiple riders.

It's a great motovlogging setup, being able to talk on the bike means I don't have to shoot nearly as much footage off the bike as I used to - so I'm less reliant on having a cameraman around!

	<TEXT> The one dunk I ever got in a basketball game. I should add, it was a D-grade women's game and I was refereeing at the time. 

I'd spent several hours a day between the ages of 17 and 20 obsessed with trying to dunk. But as a 5'11 white guy the odds were stacked against me. Still, when the stars aligned I could get up there, I just couldn't quite palm the ball to get it down. A volleyball? No worries. A netball? I was throwing those down like Dr. J. Basketballs just eluded me. 

So there I am, bored out of my mind reffing this game, and one of the girls lumbers out on a "fast" break. I'm jogging behind her, the layup goes up, time slows down and my pupils dilate. 

I saw the sit - the ball was going to teeter on the front of the rim. I could just feel it. And instinct kicked in. I wasn't going to miss my chance. 

I took three quick steps and launched, grabbed the ball, and slammed it down with all my strength, shouting like a caveman. I landed triumphantly, threw my head back and hollered. 

And then I saw the confused faces of the players, blew my whistle and gave somebody a sideball. 

Best part was, as we got started again a kid on the sideline burst out in tears, wailing "no Jordans! No Jordans! "

Made my year.  </TEXT>
