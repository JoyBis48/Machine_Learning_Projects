	<TEXT> When trying to uninstall, it seems like I check the box of a folder that I am SURE I didn't download and that seems suspicious, but when I click uninstall it doesn't do anything. I'll click uninstall multiple times and wait for 10-15 min and still nothing. Checked my extensions and nothing their that is suspicious, just google slides, sheets, and docs. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> HELP NEEDED: SuperAdRemove Virus Removal </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-07-17 11:12:22 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hello, recently my Chrome is being affected by a virus of sorts that always appears when i search something on google, it brings up suggestions that says 'Ads by SuperAdRemoval' as you can see on the photo.

It doesn't appear on my extensions and on the control panel of programs so i have no idea on how to remove this virus?!

Any help would be appreciated, thanks.

This is the image of the virus: http://imgur.com/gallery/S94FW13/new </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No, whenever he brings up the topic about companies with names without meaning, he always mentions Seananners, Pepsi, and Cisco. If you're a PKA Historian then you heard him talk about this topic like 5-6 times already. He doesn't know that Cisco stems from that. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A lost dog strays into a jungle. A lion sees this from a distance and says with caution "this guy looks edible, never seen his kind before". So the lion starts rushing towards the dog with menace. The dog notices and starts to panic but as he's about to run he sees some bones next to him and gets an idea and says loudly "mmm...that was some good lion meat!". The lion abruptly stops and says " woah! This guy seems tougher then he looks, I better leave while I can". Over by the tree top, a monkey witnessed everything. Evidently, the monkey realizes the he can benefit from this situation by telling the lion and getting something in return. So the monkey proceeds to tell the lion what really happened and the lion says angrily "get on my back, we'll get him together". So they start rushing back to the dog. The dog sees them and realized what happened and starts to panic even more. He then gets another idea and shouts "where the hell is that monkey! I told him to bring me another lion an hour ago... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Murkah is my favorite host/guest. But where I think many might get confused with my comment is that Wings brought a certain type of spontaneous entertainment and hilaritiy. And, yes most of the time we would laugh at him but that was what cause most of the best moments on the show ever. Seriously go watch some 'Funniest moments of PKA' videos on youtube 90% the funny spawned from Wings. I love Murkah but he's more intellectual and calculated with his sarcastic remarks. Murkah is my favorite host/guest of every single person whose been on PKA but no one truly can replace or replicate what wings did for the show.  </TEXT>
