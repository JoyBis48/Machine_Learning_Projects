	<TEXT> It's not all about BPA, and the fact your falling for that shit shows your all about the hype.  Harbs and Balke don't give a fuck about that, they're drafting off what gives the ball club the best competitive edge and need.  Your basically questioning the brain trust of a organization that has light years of knowledge and experience over your amateur thought process.  Get over it </TEXT>

	<TEXT> [You can prepare chicken in such a way that will kill off disease while leaving the flesh cold and uncooked.  In Japan, this is called toriwasa.  The idea is to cook all the of outward facing meat fibers to kill of disease that may have made contact.  Since these diseases dont penetrate into the flesh, deep frying or poaching for just a few minutes will kill off disease.](http://tonguecheek.com/2010/05/ask-a-chef-can-you-eat-raw-chicken/comment-page-1/)

I^ve only cooked with bone in using 500 degree high heat for the first 10-12 min, then lowering the heat to 225-250.  Sorta worried that boneless will cook way faster, and a over cooked rib roast is sad for Xmas.  Im hoping reddit has some suggestions.  BTW, its a 1.6 kg rib approx 3.5 lbs.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> if you're trying to stir the pot, you succeeded.  i'm calling you out because you have no basis for your post.  can you back up your claim, or are you just giving a opinion?  

no one has to keep moss satisfied, and if you've been reading the papers, moss has been a true veteran.  he's even suggesting plays that aren't designed for him. we're all fans with amateur opinions, but don't bring a useless claim.  what you just stated isn't a legit concern.   </TEXT>

2 years ago in NYC, I was busted for smoking a joint on the street. The court decided to offer an A.C.D (Adjournment of contemplation dismissal) if I didnt get into trouble after a year. My case would then be sealed.
Fast forward to present day, I'm applying for a job in pharma and was curious as to what will show on my background check. My guess was that since the case was sealed, it would not show, but wanted to see if Redditors out here had any insight to this. Any help would do </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The road to the Superbowl goes thru the Giants.  Alex played em 2x, and failed.  I'll give the benefit of the doubt from last years's depleted receiving core, but this year he has weapons.  

If Harb was able to get a player with a low ceiling and get him to max out, how far can he take a player with a much greater potential?  Our coaching staff was so clever and amazing with Alex, just imagine what they have in store for Kaep.  They've been game planning for Kaep, they will put him in situations to succeed.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Unknown entity?  Our coaching staff watches and scrutinizes these 2 players everyday for the past 2 years, they know the exact weakness and strengths of both.  Now while Kaep might not have the stats all Alex lovers love to spew, he's opening up the playbook Harbs designed to have.  

I got 5 on it saying we'll see a bomb to Moss in the next few weeks, and we'll see different plays we haven't seen all season because we've had to cater to Alex so much.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Whoever is under center from here on out, we support Harbs fully.  This past week there's been tons of shit talking between which QB is better.  I'm guilty of this as well.  

However if we lose in the playoffs, the last thing I want to see on this message board is another QB debate, or fans questioning Harbs choice.  We ride n die as a team, no throwing anyone under the bus.  It's not about, "Alex wouldn't have made that mistake, or Kaep was too young"  I'm done with this rant, let's go Niners.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Exactly this, every Alex debate has to have #'s and %s.  Now while that might look sexy to Alexsexuals, we look way more dynamic with kaep.  Even VD raved about how much more zip the ball has when it comes out of kaeps hands.  

Ill give some benefit of the doubt to Alex last year bc of the depleted receiving core, but no excuse for this years giants game.  3 int's, and that's with suped up WR's.  I think our play book was at half max bc we had to cater to Alex.  People forget how dope our coaching staff is that put Alex in situations to succeed.  Guarantee Randy Moss is gonna have 70 yd bomb from Colin soon.   </TEXT>
