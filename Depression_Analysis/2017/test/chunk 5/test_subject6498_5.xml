	<TEXT> I have a bit of homemade tinfoil. Noone believes me, but I'm fairly certain there is something to it, but maybe not what I think. Anyway.


Bran climbed the walls of Winterfell so many times that he knew every rock. 

He has gotten better and better at warging Hodor. It will culminate with Bran somehow warging/influencing Ser Duncan the Tall. Thick as a **castle wall**

My theory is rooted in Bran's nagging about wanting to be a knight, people telling him he can't ever be. But Dunk was never knighted!

And a line from The Sworn Sword. when Dunk defies his sworn lord and sends the poor villagers home, practically saving their lives. "It was if some god had put the words in my mouth. Not the warrior". </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Swedish Jan Guillou wrote the  autobiographical novel "Evil" which movie adaption (2003) got an oscar nomination for best foreign film. 

On Topic: He also wrote a trilogy about late 12th century Sweden. Called **The Templar Knight**

**Short Synopsis:**
An unstable Sweden before it was Sweden. 

In one of families fighting with the present king is Arn who get sent to a monastery as a young boy. There he learn one of the foreign Monks once was a Templar Knight in "The Holy Land". 

About a third of books takes place in an around Jerusalem and Gaza. It tells the buildup to the Battle of Hattin and about the major characters involved in that battle.

I recommend both the books and the movies which got Stellan Skarsgrd and a lot of swedish people. Boys and girls. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I enjoy watch grrm talk,  but lately I think George have become a bit of a hypocrite. Some people will tear me a new asshole or call me unfair for criticizing him, because apparently he is God.

But here we go.. All he's ever talked about in interviews is how he like to make his readers feel unsafe when their favorite character is threatened. And I have agreed with him. I did feel unsafe reading Game of Thrones.. At least after Ned's beheading. 

But now he's changed perspective completely. Apparently it doesn't matter if you are worried about you characters when you read anymore. Now it's the "journey that matters" nevermind what he has always said before... 

I just think it would be more admirable if he faced the problem with his back straight, admitting this is not an ideal situation, but we just have to cope. 

Instead of changing his point of view to fit HBO's opinion...  </TEXT>

And who are you, the proud lord said,

that I must bow so low?

Only a cat of a different coat,

that's all the truth I know.

In a coat of gold or a coat of red,

a lion still has claws,

And mine are long and sharp, my lord,

as long and sharp as yours.

And so he spoke, and so he spoke,

that Lord of Castamere,

But now the rains weep o'er his hall,

with no one there to hear.

Yes now the rains weep o'er his hall,

As for keeping a sub like this growing. Make it look like a sub about astrophysics. Satellites, galaxies, corny stuff like that makes for a great banner together with a well designed logo.

 Keep a steady flow of interesting news, but don't drown out discussions posted by the rest.

	<TEXT> The paning through the images feel a bit off sometimes. Try zooming out from faces, keeping the attention on the characters. And the voice the reader does for Dunk is horrible. 

Otherwise the moods and everything feels great. I can imagine the process to be quite time consuming, but I could see this as a nice way of enjoying the story though copyright will most likely take it down.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I find let's plays without narrating a bit pointless. But I understand, it's hard to find something to talk about and I think Scott Manley got it right with the "New me" and "Old me". That way you can put voiceover where you blabber about pointless things, say something stupid. Or such :) 
Also, fastforward your launches. I get tired by just watching my own, again and again! ^^

Anpther tip is to do a better description. List your mods and stuff and do a short summery of what the episode is all about. 

Otherwise I really liked the video and the creations. </TEXT>

Biking to school, grocery shopping. Well. All tedious stuff you have to do becomes enjoyable. I discovered time goes a lot faster while you're concentrating on a book than it does listening to music. </TEXT>
