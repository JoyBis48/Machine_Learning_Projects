	<TEXT> Still doesn't change the fact she cloned big boss multiple times without him asking, after specifically saying it was against her moral code in mgs3, creating the rift that ended up driving the patriots apart, as well as drive gray fox crazy enough to kill her. She could well be 'forced into it by zero' or something, but I think that's less interesting than having her do it of her own volition. Her betrayal probably struck Big boss the hardest. He'd expect EVA or ocelot or zero to betray him, they're spies after all, but the kind hearted medic who was obsessed with movies? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ideally, I think he should only appear in some sort of 1970's style flashback sequence. Para medic would probably be a better fit for having an actual confrontation with Big boss, seeing as she was essentially snakes best friend, and a lot of people's favorite character in 3, and she's pretty much the most morally bankrupt member of the patriots. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So my theory for the 'monster' of this episode is that it's actually some sort of time distorted version of Clara. Think about it. She's been scattered through time, every time, every place the doctor goes or thinks about going. We've already seen it go wrong with dalek!Clara, don't you think a universal constant obsessed with the Doctor would create some, y'know issues for the universe.

However, I doubt we'll ever get a real reveal. My above theory is too dark and grand for them to follow through, but it's neat to think about! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I get where your coming from, I truly do, and I HOPE Ant man is a good or great film, and that Edgar Wrights vision carries over,however, I think the complaints are way more justified than you make them out to be.


1) Joss whedon is in no way comparable to Reed. Joss Whedon worked on the scripts for X-men, Toy story and the x-men comics. He also wrote and directed multiple Emmy award winning shows that had directorially strong moments. ('Hush' comes to mind) He also made Serenity, which, commercial success or not, was one of the best Sci-Fi movies of the past decade. It's dumb to have doubts about Joss Whedon, it's not to have doubts about Peyton Reed, whose made multiple Bad, mediocre, and more importantly generically directed movies.


2) Favreau also made multiple great movies, I don't get why people keep bringing Elf up, It was a great Christmas movie. Alan Taylor directed episodes of the most critically acclaimed fantasy TV show of all time.The Russo's are slightly more comparable but didn't take over from an amazing Action director like, say, Tarantino.


3) I think the most valid comparison is actually another studio. Darren Aranofsky was originally set to direct the wolverine. But got replaced at the last minute due to 'directorial differences.' You can logically apply all the same arguments to FOX, they hadn't gotten it wrong yet, (x-men 3 and origins wolverine are comparable to the incredible hulk and Iron man 2) James Marigold has directed stuff before etc. etc. posthumously, don't you think people saying Aranofsky would've done a better job were correct? This stuff has precedence, it's not completely out of leftfield.


Small aside: Edgar's work is hardly obscure stuff, ESPECIALLY as we have to compare it to British films rather than American films. The cornetto trilogy has been hugely critically successful, and was one of the most commercially successful franchises in British cinema. Even Scott pilgrim didn't lose money and became a cult hit on DVD.


In conclusion. The Edgar Wright fiasco is way more rational that going "wah wah, Gal Godot is too skinny" </TEXT>

	<TEXT> How are they changing the character? Thor isn't literally changing genders, he's just temporarily become de-powered, whilst someone else takes up the mantel. He's not even leaving the comic! Completely changing the character is like when in the 80's Thor became a frog and solved animal problems for 6 issues, and that is seen by many as the greatest Thor story ever told. 

Comics are about non static characters, 12 come out every year after all, so they **have** to change things up to keep interest up. The harry potter comparison doesn't really work, but actually did happen. In the last two Harry potter books, J.K Rowling not only killed Dumbledore, but set the last book entirely outside of Hogwarts, because good characters grow and change and face adversity, rather than remain static. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Whilst I agree with you over the fanboys being fanboys stuff, there's a significant difference between complaining about Joss Whedon (who had already directed two great films, serenity and cabin in the woods) and worrying about Ant man now that Wright's left. Edgar Wright is probably the best action comedy director or the last decade. It's reasonable to assume that Peyton Reed will not fill his directorial shoes, it's am similar situation to the Star trek 3 Roberto Orci thing: There's actual evidence that those people will do a worse job. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Why? What is so upsetting about a temporary change during a story arc? It's just whining about writers wanting to tell any sort of interesting narrative. If beta Ray bill or frog Thor were introduced today, people would be up in arms, despite those being two of the best Thor stories. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The cycle is being repeated with the Gal Godot/ Jesse Eisenberg stuff, lambasting people for hypothetical performances. The worst part is that the asshole fanboy always gets to say the last word. If Gal Godot is great, they'll either say 'well she put in a surprisingly competent performance' or they turn up their noses and say 'well, Gal godot did an ok performance but such and such would've been better IMO' but if Gal Godot does a bad performance, fanboys get to say 'see, I was right all along, my fatalistic attitude happened to align somewhat with reality, aren't I the BEST?' </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Deadpool's really popular actually. He's been in a tonne of games (MVC, marvel ultimate alliance, was a main character in that marvel MMO, was a main character in lego marvel, had his own game that was popular with lets players) been featured in a couple of cartoons and is generally incredibly popular in the under 30/ geek market. He's also one of the bestselling marvel characters, and is prominent in the marvel universe (he's basically the new wolverine, popping up in other peoples comics. I'd definitely say he's the most popular marvel hero with no movie, and if FOX didn't get the rights by fluke, marvel would have made a deadpool movie already. </TEXT>

Eventually beat it by going human for the first time and requesting assistance (but not before having to kick a PVP guy off a cliff, again at level 9) what a game! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So I'm just notifying those unaware right now, but r/games currently has two fairly enlightening threads about the yogscast right now. One talks of the recent Totalbiscuit video outlining problems with the yogscasts new business model 


(http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/2arhv6/totalbiscuit_outlines_a_number_of_issues_with_the/)


and another talks of the apparent abandonment of the yogventures game 

(http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/2apng1/yogscast_cheat_backers_for_567000_on/)

I realize that this is essentially a link to other reddit posts, but since this is a subreddit dedicated entirely to the yogscast, I think it's important that you're kept notified of the 'current affairs' so to speak. Lewis has also been VERY active on this, so if you have any queries about yogventures or the promos, now might be the best time to say them. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Interesting thing about the movie is how it was heavily influenced by the fandom, and in particular fanfiction. Elements like Charlotte and sakuya/kyoko shipping are big in the fandom, as are 'happy endings' so I highly reccomend checking out the madoka magica entry on TV tropes to catch all the nods. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Eh, It's debatable. It BECOMES part of the narrative, but you can really easily not watch it if you think Ep 12 was the perfect ending. Part of the magic of rebellion is that ep 12 essentially left no loose ends, so it makes you feel like a bastard for requesting a arbitrary (and deliberately) contrived 'continuation' of the story, despite the fact it's over. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would actually say to only watch rebellion if you want more madoka magica content. It's a better film if you approach it with the mentality that you're actively watching to get more content with the characters, rather than assuming it's part of the pre-existing narrative. Rebellion also makes more sense if you read Madoka magica's TV tropes page (after watching the main series) because rebellion also makes lots of references to the fandom.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In my mind, 'list' standing is defined by relevance to the actual universe/cross pollination. Carol Danvers is a primary member of the Avengers, Marvel's premier superhero team,and has been for ages therefore, I posit that she's A-list. I would also argue that her DC equivalent, wonder-woman, has never been a massively popular character amongst fans, at least when compared to say, Batman, wolverine or deadpool, yet is branded A-list. </TEXT>
