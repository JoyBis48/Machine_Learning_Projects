	<TEXT> Matty Ice is that guy you need. Especially with those bonuses. Ryan has one problem and that's his offensive line. As long as he can pick up the rush and get it out quick he will have another big game against TB. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Matt Ryan. Has huge potential for scoring here. Only problem is that offensive line. I like going for ceiling in close decisions like this. I think wilson is safer, but Ryan could score a lot.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah I think Denver's D is underrated and Seattle's is overrated. Eli has been solid-good this year and I think he can keep it up. Surprising he hasn't dipped without Cruz. As a giants fan I can only wish Cruz never got hurt.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would go with Wilson. Yeah Matt Ryan had that huge game early in the year, but that was at home. Ryan has more weapons, but significantly less time to use those weapons. I don't think you can go wrong though. </TEXT>
