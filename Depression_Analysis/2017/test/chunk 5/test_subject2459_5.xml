	<TEXT> Ha, ha I get that with the amiibos :) 

Well I guess to start you should buy a starter pack. I take it you're getting 2.0? If you are then I reccomend either the avengers starter pack or the merida and stitch toy box pack. Then you can buy other characters. 

You probably already know this but you can get power discs which give you new toys, paints etc and some are rare so there's a lot to trade and collect. 

You can buy characters from the first game and they work just fine on 2.0 but don't buy any playsets from the first one since they don't work on 2.0

Most stores that sell characters do deals on them. For example the ASDA (I'm in Scotland) near me sells 2 for 15 and they sell packs like the girl power pack which gives you violet, rapunzel and vanellope for 13, so look out for deals and also check eBay and Amazon etc. Some characters there are overpriced, like Elsa for example in store she costs 10, online she costs between 20-50. You can get really good deals online though, for example you can get some older characters for 3 when they normally cost 10. 

If you have any questions just ask. </TEXT>

If it is I shave, best thing to do is shave with the hair, down, untill your skin gets used to it, then after a few weeks if you keep it up you can shave against it for a closer shave. You should buy nivea men 48 hour anti-perspirant. I no longer need it but when I started shaving it made it stay smooth and I never once itched, eventually you get used to it and it won't itch.  </TEXT>

I have more and I'll add them when I find them :)


EDIT 1: I'm glad I've been able to give some away, I've crossed out the ones I've given away. I was going to do this on a first come first serve bases but since so many people want stitch and merida I'll pick someone at random tonight. When I find them I should have maleificent, venom, hulk, gamora and around 4 more but I can't promise those ones since I'm not exactly sure where I've sat them but if I find them during the week I'll make a new post. I hope the codes I've given away so far are being enjoyed, I'll keep you all posted :)

	<TEXT> I have both, they really are great games. I did enjoy the playsets but to be  honest the missions are fun but not amazing. You can unlock some awesome things and do some really cool stuff but some times they are pretty repetitive. I think the incredibles, lone ranger and toy story playsets were the best and you can get most pretty cheap on Amazon. For the second one the playsets give some awesome maps like New York city.

I suggest you buy 2.0 since you can pretty much buy everything from 1.0 for the toy box with game currency (sparks), don't worry you don't pay for them you collect them. Plus the characters from 1.0 and the power discs can all be used in 2.0. Some of the best characters in my opinion are:


Violet (incredibles) she can go invisible and has some nice moves and force fields


Maleificent - when you get her wings she is amazing, her magic is strong but slightly slow which is a disadvantage but she is a great character


Stitch - he can't fly which is too bad because I've become so used to that but he can climb on walls, roll around in a ball and he is just an awesome character


Vanellope - she is unique because she can glitch around she says some funny stuff but I might be bias since I loved the movie


Alladin and Jasmine - both can jump pretty high, both look great and have decent voice acting, both have good projectile attacks and alladin can get a second costume if you buy the power disc


Merida - definitely bias here but I'm scottish like her which makes me absolutely love her 


Spiderman - I love his web swinging and wall climbing


Dash - his running is fun but a bit hard to control sometimes

Elsa - she can freeze enemies and is surprisingly strong 

I like basically every character except for the cars so I could go on for ever but a few honourable mentions go to 

Mrs incredible

Rapunzel

Gamora

Tinkerbell

Iron man

And hulk </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Actually they were always very anti-semetic. The people who created the KKK were bitter that the south had lost the civil war and that the slaves had been freed. So they made their robes and tried to scare recently freed slaves by telling them that they were the ghosts of dead generals from the war. As time went on they gained and lost popularity but they were at their height of power in the 1920's. Kkk parades were a common sight and they had thousands of members over the US. There was one incident in a small town, I can't remember the name right now, where almost every white man was a member of the klan and as such they could commit any form of racial crime without consequences since even law men had become members, this made life hell For pretty much anyone that wasn't a white Christian. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi, I'm 15 too!! :) (almost 16) and I've had a few good streaks but I left for a while and I came back yesterday. For me it made me more active (which was weird since I'm an indoor gamer type person), I felt more confident, procrastinated less and I'm just happier in general. Again I was a bit socially awkward. After I stopped I swore to myself that I would keep doing these things and so far I have. Even though it was hard I've forced myself to only game at weekends cause it was taking up too much of my time and study during weekdays, also I go out with my friends a lot more now, I used to only go out once in a blue moon. It is difficult and I don't know if we "need" a sexual release but going without one was fine with me (even though it was hard at times). If you do happen to fap don't get down on yourself, just learn from it and start again. Also if you decide that you don't want to do nofap just don't watch porn. Seriously if you think about it, its just filmed prostitution and you're watching other people have sex, finally read some of the horror stories on here, some guys watched so much porn that they ended up with erectile dysfunction. Good luck in your decision. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi, I'm from Scotland and I will be going into fifth year after the summer. When I leave School I want to go to university and train to become a history teacher and I was wondering what qualifications I would need to do this. I understand that I'd need history, maths, English etc. I'm doing fairly well in all of my subjects, besides maths. In all of them I am NAT 5 but in maths I'm NAT 4. Will this be enough to get me into a university to train since history doesn't really require maths. So basically I'm asking:

* What qualifications do I need

And

* Is a NAT 4 award in maths enough or do I need to continue it?

Please help, anything is appreciated. </TEXT>
