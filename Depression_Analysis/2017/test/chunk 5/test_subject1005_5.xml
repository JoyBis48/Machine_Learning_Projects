	<TEXT> I know this movie wasn't received very warmly, but I find it strange that even Coen bros fans don't place this one too high. It is in the same vein as The Big Lebowski in that it is a big much ado about nothing and characters with very familiar and strange quirks. What does R/movies think? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I seem to always get downvoted when saying ANYTHING remotely critical of this movie, but there just isn't anything special or unique about it. I agree, it's a great movie and there's nothing fundamentally I would change about it, but I feel like people (younger people in particular) see this as their Stand By Me. It is a very good movie, but really isn't something we haven't seen before. Go ahead. Downvote me.  </TEXT>
