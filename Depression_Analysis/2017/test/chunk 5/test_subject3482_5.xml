	<TEXT> This sounds really grim. Your best bet is to find a new job because even when you get promoted, there will another issue for the next promotion. This company sounds culturally broken with poor incentives. 

The other issue is that your manager might just not be honest with you. Managers, especially in technology who don't have a ton of managerial experience, sometimes don't know how to give feedback, and so will tell employees that they are doing great work when they might not be.  This might not be the case with you, but you should try and get feedback from multiple sources. If your output is indeed double and high quality, find a new company.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The kindle is so much easier to read and much lighter. I am amazed OP reads eBooks on Macbook Pro. Thats really hard ergonomically. 

One option is to use the "night" options on apps. e.g. Instapaper ad others come with a "night" mode where they turn the background black and the text white. I find that a lot easier to read.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You seem like you have a ton of solid operating experience. I would imagine that if you study finance, you could perhaps translate that into an operating role at a larger company and build a career from there. 

If you really like programming, you could get a software degree but without a lot of programming experience, it may be hard to get a great software job and your experience doesn't really back it up.

Perhaps after the finance degree you could look at a startup role where you can blend your operating and software skill sets better but with the limited info here, my take would be to get a degree in finance / econ.  </TEXT>

quantitative modeler
Data developer
Data analytics
Marketing science
Predictive modeler

In fact searching for "data science" often leads people to the wrong results when they are in fact looking for jobs with analytics / statistics. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Research using sites like NYbits (not sure where you are looking for but I am sure there are similar sites in other cities). These tell you what prior rents were and complains by former tenants.

Others have captured most of the things to look for. One thing that is a game changer is a dishwasher. You'll be surprised how much easier that makes your life so if you can get a place with a dishwasher - give that props.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I can foresee a few potential changes:
1. Much more even distribution of humans across the globe as the perils of sea navigation decrease substantially. E.g. North America may have been settled by people from Africa and Asia given that the perils of travel would have been meaningfully reduced

2. Remote island archipelagos would also be meaningfully more settled

3. Titanic would have clearly been a much smaller tragedy, but more importantly, the survival of influential rich aristrocats like JJ Astor could have significantly changed recent business history

4. Coming back to #1, meaningfully more trade that started earlier could have significantly changed culture and food. E.g. ancient civilizations like Mesopotamia, Greece and Indus Valley may have intermingled more, and survived longer as a result creating more continuous history

Perhaps investment and innovation would be more on naval and sea-faring capabilities and less on terrestrial conquest. This could have political ramifications for sure (more colonization, less inter-country fighting in Europe), but also delay innovations like rail travel and air travel in favor of water based innovations

What I am not sure of is whether this would substantially decrease the historical advantage had by early adopters to agriculture. Would fishing really enjoy a substantial advantage is unclear to me. If it did, you could conceive a situation where coastal fishing economies could balance out the power of agricultural economies. Not sure the implications of that though.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You should politely respond with "I really appreciate the offer. I am very keen to take up the internship and work for you, but given that I have to move to do this internship - this will be very hard for me to do with this offer given that this will barely cover my rent". Be very polite and stick to the facts.

Be open to ideas they have. Perhaps they can help get you subsidized accommodation, or can offer you an end of summer bonus if you get an offer. Assuming this is a job you want, they might have other ways to make you whole. 

But only have this conversation if you are fairly sure you are ready to walk away if they don't budge since at the internship level, companies are usually less willing to negotiate.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Game of Thrones. That way I can manage the topic four different ways:
1. You've seen the show but haven't read the books???? The books are w-aaay better
2. You've read the books but haven't seen the show???? The storyline is diverging and the show is getting really interesting. Plus boobies
3. You've read the books and seen the show? Isn't it amazing??!! Do you think the Dany will make it to Westeros? 
4. You haven't read the books or watched the show???? Here I'll tell you all about it whether you like it or not

Replace with Hunger Games / Sherlock Holmes / Ender's Game. Lather-rinse-repeat.


EDIT: I am so sorry about the spoiler earlier. I didn't even realize it at at the time. Edited to remove.   </TEXT>
