	<TEXT> The thing that I find interesting about atheism is that generally they don't believe in an all-powerful God. What if God isn't all-powerful? Perhaps there is some form of higher-dimensional being who is trying to help life survive in the same way that we humans try to make plants grow etc.

In my eyes it's not God vs No God. There are a lot more possibilities than that. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm assuming there's a good reason that these sort of things aren't being reported in more prestigious news services (BBC, Guardian etc etc.). 

Is this actually much less of a big deal than DM are making out? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't quite have the same problem as you, but I do have trouble with speaking a little too quickly. To be honest the best fix for me is that I now live with several foreign people, every time they mishear what I say it's a reminder that I need to speak more clearly. 

I'd suggest doing something similar. Every time someone in day to day life asks you to repeat what you said, use this as a reminder that you should be speaking more clearly.

EDIT: typo </TEXT>
