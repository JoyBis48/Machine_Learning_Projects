	<TEXT> I have a feeling the "sudden" decision to have the KotR tournament was due to Daniel Bryan's injury, and the non defense of the Intercontinental title at ER. 

This way, they give the viewers a "title" match, give some talents the needed exposure (Neville), give the network an extra network only show, and still keep the title on Bryan until they figure out how long he will be out. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Physics told us it wont happen. To do quick release system for engine would introduce high stressed parts, especially on the drivetrain. That does not include the fact that they need to unplug and replug the fuel line, which introduce danger. 

The only real solution would be to make the whole rear detachable. But that would mean a weaker monocoque they wpuld flex and roll and in the end disintegrate the car. To renforce it would mean added weight. And there is no way they would want a heavy car because that would offset any advantage they would have in the first place </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It takes nearly half a minute to change a front wing. And that't just taking off four pins, taking off the old wing, put on a new one, and putting on a pin again. 

An engine much more complicated. Considering that the modern engine now is ICE, where it interconnects to each other, and more importantly connects to a drivetrain that connects to the rear of the chassis. That would at least take an hour of work. </TEXT>

- rFactor (gMotor2)

-- rFactor team version, which some teams uses for promo purposes on roadshow. McLaren uses this. Also Formula E road show uses this modded version at all of their races.

-- rFactor Pro, of which some F1 teams like Red Bull and Toro Rosso uses for their simulator. 

-- rFactor 2, an updated version of rFactor with DX11 support

- GTR/GTR 2 (gMotor2)

-- Developer of GTR, Simbin/Slightly Mad Studios went on to make NFS Shift and Shift 2 with only some game engine, with graphic updates.

	<TEXT> I don't agree to an extent. What's the best flowing track on the calendar? Hungaroring. The drivers love it because once you're in the groove, it's like riding a roller coaster driving there. But we all know how hard it is to overtake there. 

While a circuit should be blamed, some of the problem also lies with the cars themselves. The dirty air syndrome was always something the FIA had tried to get rid of, every time they introduce a new rule. But every time they do, engineers find a way to gain more downforce in areas they could, which in turn, introduce back this problem. The rulings for 2009 for example was introduced due to this as well as various ruling there after, but almost always, the teams manage to churn out a car that still has this problem.

Combined that with Pirelli tyres that does not last that much (because oh, people want to see tyres that does not last) you have team that err on the side of caution and instruct the drivers to drive within a certain constraint.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As said, I live in South East Asia. Other than WWE, there are basically no other wrestling program on TV shown. A cable channel did show TNA during the Hogan era, but that does not even last a year.

I am really interested in WWE alternatives, especially LU and was wondering is there a way to view them other than *cough*acquiring it via video sharing*cough*.

Thanks in advance!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> bad encoding on Fox, combined to their auto bandwith selection for streaming lead to this. Fox also shows F1 in South East Asia, and their 1.2Mbps HD stream on their website looks washed and bad. And even when it's 1.2Mbps, it will auto downgrade to the next lowest, 400Mbps  the moment it detects a bit of lag on your internet. 

I discovered that turning off all things running in background, especially torrent, help in keeping the stream at 1.2Mbps.  </TEXT>
