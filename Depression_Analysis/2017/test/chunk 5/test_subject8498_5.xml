	<TEXT> The fact that you can't properly contextualise analogies and believe that I'm saying Valve = a SO/person in absolutely every aspect just because I compared exageratedly to prove a point how bashing something you may like again in the future may not be the best choice and interpreted that as me being a fanboy shows me how delusional you are.

I believe that needed more commas, but well. Put a hip hop beat on the background and it'll read better. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Of course it is, that's why I also disagree with the "let's all hail the allmighty Valve". That's exactly why people went to the other extreme all of the sudden, because they were on one extreme to begin with.

If you love anything as obsessively as PCMR did with Valve and NEVER criticise any aspect or bad decision, of course it's going to blow up as soon as they make the first very bad move.

This is why this subreddit has NOT to go back again to love Valve as they were the cure for all known diseases. As you say, it's just a company. I still believe a great one, but a company nonetheless. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The only thing I disagree with was the bashing with "What has Valve done in the few years for us?" and mega-lists of "look at the reasons for how Valve has sucked in the last decade". Those are words you can't take back.  

I always felt that they were going to back out from this decision in the first week or two, that's why I didn't engage in bashing the company's name. It's like having a fight with your SO and start spreading that she/him is a shitty partner, that she's a liar, etc, to all of your friends, and then coming back with her after fixing things. The people who you complained to don't forget the things you've said.  

Now, they may be true but there was no need in pointing out lists of only bad choices Valve has done and upvoting them to heavens with x5 golds. My reaction was "where was all hatred this last week?", and now "where is all this hatred now?" It's what's wrong with going from loving something, hating it, and then loving it again.

EDIT: TIL: don't use overly exagerated analogies, Reddit likes to interpret things very literally and believes I see a game company as my soulmate. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For starters, I think Stiller did an excellent job and that he is an amazing actor. I just think maybe the movie would be (in my opinion and to my taste, that is) a little better if it would've been made in a more serious tone, with different casting.

For example, the role Seann Penn plays and how its portraited feels to me spot-on. I think he's a very serious, dark, and interesting character in a movie that has *some* silly-comedy bits, and would be better accompanied by a movie that goes along with that theme.  

All of that aside, I think it's an excellent movie. It made me cry, laugh, and it has that "Into the Wild" thing where you finish watching it and want to just go and ride a bike through the world. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I watched it really high the first time, and couldn't believe what I was watching. The music and the photography are incredible. I cried in the part that plays that Bowie's song, in the bar, where he has to decide whether he goes to the chopper or not.  

Upon watching it a few more times I believe it's an amazing film but could've been better with better less comedy-like casting. I don't think Ben Stiller was the best choice for that part. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> She very clearly told him at the beginning she wasn't interested in anything serious.   



500 days of summer helped me a lot to "forgive" my ex for dumping me. I was in a lot of anger towards her, she didn't cheat on me or anything like that as far as I know, but I was very angry still. After the day we broke up I didn't talk to her and I distanced myself completely as I knew it was for the best, but I was still very hurt.  


That film made me realize she hadn't done anything wrong. The relationship wasn't the same in a long time and she acted in behalf of her own well being and made the decision she thought was best at the moment, how can I blame her for that? Why should I blame a person for taking a decision that they thought makes them happier? If I think I own that right upon someone, the selfish one is me, not them.

	<TEXT> You think wrong, I've never believed we were in the right to reclaim them, mainly because they have been occupied for about 190 years now, it doesn't make much sense. If you do some reading you'll find out that the war in 82 was only by and for the dictatorial government to remain in power longer, they actually never had the desire to regain the islands. </TEXT>
