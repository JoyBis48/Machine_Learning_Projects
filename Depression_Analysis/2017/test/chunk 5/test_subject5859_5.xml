	<TEXT> As for the story itself, it was entitled "The Dancing Fool." Like so many Trout stories, it was about a tragic failure to communicate. Here was the plot: A flying saucer creature named Zog arrived on Earth to explain how wars could be prevented and how cancer could be cured. He brought the information from Margo, a planet where the natives conversed by means of farts and tap dancing. Zog landed at night in Connecticut. He had no sooner touched down than he saw a house on fire. He rushed into the house, farting and tap dancing, warning the people about the terrible danger they were in. The head of the house brained Zog with a golfclub. - Kurt Vonnegut from Breakfast of Champions </TEXT>

My Simpsons script has at least 4 good jokes.  (Two of which I did not steal)  Thank you for your time and consideration! 

P.S.  Yes, I definitely have Doc Hollywood on VHS.   </TEXT>
