	<TEXT> Temazepam is good. A lot of people actually say Xanax is the most recreational BENZO, but etizolam (pretty sure that's RC, if its not been regulated yet) is considered to be extremely recreational to some but I've heard some people don't feel anything from it but still black out somehow. I also think Midazolam is one of the more recreational benzos out there too but I believe it's pretty sedating and creates a lot of amnesia (they use it as a sort of pre anesthetic). I also believe Flunitrazepam is considered really, really recreational. Basically what I'm getting at is that it all depends on the person and what that person personally wants out of a drug and how they react to it. 

Edit: Benzos all in all aren't considered that recreational though, but alot of people obviously do find them recreational.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Opium has been used for thousands of years, it should be socially acceptable as much as alcohol but of course it's not because of the propaganda that's been fed to us for the last 50-60 years. Alcohol is such a dirty drug as well (even compared to opiates) because it acts on so much receptors, obviously mainly NMDA and GABA, but there quite a lot of receptors it acts on directly and indirectly. 

I don't hope that alcohol comes out of "social acceptance". I just hope that other drugs can enter social acceptance as well.  </TEXT>

Basically one part of the patch can have WAAAAY more than the rest of the patch, and the other patch will have a different "hot spot" than the last.

	<TEXT> Opiates don't really cause organ damage long term, and if they do it's extremely rare. Everyone thinks that heroin, morphine etc. cause liver damage, but that's untrue. Cigarettes are worse than opiates because they have a lot of strong carcinogens in them, which WILL eventually cause some sort of cancer, maybe in 10 years or maybe in 40 years of smoking, but it will happen. Opiates can cause your immune system to weaken, but not to the point of something like AIDS or anything, just minorly fuck up your immune system. 

Also, they reason he said it should be legalized is because it would decrease the amount of OD's, yeah there will still be people who intentionally overdose or just overdose accidentally, but it would decrease. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I've not posted here in a while because I've been doing pretty okay, not great not bad, about a 6-7/10 though. But I do have one big problem that I can't get over and that's pretty bad memory loss, I'd say it's gone from mild to moderate pretty fast (a few months) I'm not sure if this is related to schizophrenia, meds or some other health problem (definitely not aging because I'm not old enough for dementia). I'm currently on 150-200mg of seroquel. I get confused pretty regularly, but not soo often, I've forgotten things I've literally JUST done about 2 seconds ago (confirmed by family members), I'm forgetting what to write right now actually, I just don't know really what's going on or happening, but yet I do, it's literally like things will just not hold up in my head, I do something forget it, do something else forget it, It feels like I'm forgetting everything. Someone will tell me to do something and I'll forget they ever even told me to do that a few mins later. 

The worst part though Is I just generally feel really confused and as if I'm forgetful in the moment about everything... Can anyone tell me why this is? Is it schizophrenia, med related? Or something else?

I feel it's a lot more than mild forgetfulness, I just know I'm forgetting things really bad because other people are telling me in the moment, and confusion is really bothering me, i feel like I just can't remember most shit. 

Anyone help?  </TEXT>
