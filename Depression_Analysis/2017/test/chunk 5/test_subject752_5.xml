	<TEXT> When you have to factor in..

* Travel cost to get equipment to site.
* Hire price for the machines to rip it up, re seal it, smooth it over etc.
    * A machine to rip up old road
    * A machine to lay new seal
    * A machine to lay new arreggrate
    * A machine to smooth it all down
    * **Not sure if you can get 1 machine to do multiple jobs?**
* Getting council approval to take road.
* OSH precautions - Road cone's diversion plans.
* Advertising may be required if it's a main state HW - so cost of hiring a fuckoff sign for a week or two.
* Cost of 5+ staff perhaps.
* Cost of clean up (dumping waste etc.)
* Cost of tar seal.
* Cost of rock aggregate.
* Cost of portaloo for time period needed.

From seeing it done a few times, depending on damage.. 
They would need to:

* Dig up X amount off road
* Lay new substrate
* Lay new tar seal and chip it

Or at least that's my extremely layman's point of view, but I'm sure you wouldn't get much change from a 80-100K $ per KM. And then you factor in redoing the bridge, this will be signifcantly higher due to probably needing to shut down the bridge/have a stop/go so probably nearer $300-400k per KM

Edit: he's recording for at least say 3minutes using this [distance calculator website cause I'm lazy..](http://www.machinehead-software.co.uk/bike/speed_distance_time_calc.html) and he's travelling at 90km/h for the entire trip, say 2minutes at 90km/h = 3kms.

So to answer your question, I would hazard a guess of around (at least) $1,000,000+ to redo the road the fucktard ripped up. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ok,  let's look at meridian energy for instance. 

They generate energy which pays dividends to the government and private corporations. 
These dividends are supported by worth and profit.
To maintain their worth they must generate a X amount of profit.
They get profit from selling energy to consumers.
An extra charge (say to Maori for water rights) eats into the profit, which means they have to charge you and I more to maintain the same worth, and continue to pay dividends.

So essentially you and I will be paying more, which will be subsiding the water payment.

So again, I pay a amount which goes to government which they use to better the entire country.
If they are successful I will pay more money which will only benefit Maori.

How is this fair? 

Again I understand if the water was Tapu, or they simply want more money, and you and I will be paying for it.

	<TEXT> Preparing for the bashing here, but seriously over this fucking profit grab.

Unlike the money which is currently gathered for water rights us used by all kiwi under say the local council who charge for the usage rights, this money will go to exclusive rights to the Maori. 

How is that not racist in it's own rights? "I don't want everyday NZ'ers to benefit from the water, I want ONLY Maori to benefit from the water use." Fuck That Shit.

Edit: if you're going to downvote me, tell me why I'm wrong.
I understand the Treaty of Waitangi, I understand Maori have rights to the LAND which was taken from them, but water is a renewable resource, it's not Tapu, how can they claim rights to be able to sell it off and make the profit from it? And take profit away from everyday NZ'ers? </TEXT>

Don't take the main highways if you're not in a rush.

West coast anywhere = must visit.

Put the camera down, and just take in the sights without a viewfinder in front of your face.

If you're from a major city, take a walk at midnight/1am basically anywhere from the main centres = More stars than you've ever likely seen anywhere else in your life. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> To be honest they are probably relying on you giving up and going away. 

The trouble is if the assholes are going to do it to you, chances are they will try it on with someone else, so fully don't give up.

By seeking legal advice you could let them know you're playing hard ball, which could be enough to scare them into paying without any further fuss. 

I'm not sure were you are, but here's a [Free phone Canterbury Law advice helpline](http://www.canlaw.org.nz/legal-info-by-phone)

[Or find your local community law centre](http://www.communitylaw.org.nz/your-local-centre/find-a-community-law-centre/)

Edit: ensure ALL your correspondence with them is captured, if you phone them put them on speaker and have another phone recording them. Of course tell them: "For complete disclosure, this call is being recorded and may be used should this matter have to go to court." it might seem like a dick move, but if it's your word against theirs don't make their life any easier.  </TEXT>

But that does raise a good point, now this could be because I see a very censored view of NZ policing via police television shows, but I see your point in that if someone is doing 1 thing dodgy, chances are likely they're also doing other stupid shit - like if they're not wearing their seatbelt, they could have an unrego'd car or something. Again, that's just from seeing TV shows, but it confirms your theory of if someone looks dodge, it's cause they are? </TEXT>

So if you were stupid enough to drive with your needle above the +5km mark, you're going to get caught. 

Drive at 50-55km/h and you're going to get lasered at 48-53km/h no problems.

If you drink and and drive once with quite a few on board = cash and demerits.
Again = cash and demerits.
Again cash and and demerits.

The definition of stupidity is doing exactly the same thing and expecting the same result. Stupid fuckers are going to be stupid fuckers. 

Demerits? They'll drive anyway. Thanks to under staffed police they're willing to risk it.

Fines? fuck it - throw it on my tab! Then when it grows too big, the court inevitably sentence them to a hundred hours or so community detention. Which if you work it out for some of the worst offenders, they are essentially being paid at a rate of a FEW HUNDRED DOLLARS AN HOUR? It's a fucking joke.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> We have so many different spoken, written and sign languages. 

Not to mention electronic communication like typing using a physical keyboard, or a software keyboard on mobile phones. 

Even then you've got dvorak, qwerty and other proprietary formats. And furthermore you've got various forms of swiping or tapping your letters.

With so many forms, is there a better version above the rest? If so why is it better?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So SKY, Mediaworks and TVNZ (TV1, TV2, TV3, TV4 and Prime) are all pissedoff we can get..

* Faster Content. 
NZ can wait *years* for Movies and TV shows etc to come to TV!

* More convenience to watch what we want. When we want. 
Instead of subscribing to some shitty unreliable expensive HDD recorder, or paying money to still have advertising anyway we can download and watch them them on any TV or mobile device whenever/wherever we want!

* Easier: Again without DRM restrictions, it's a "Hey mate, here's a flash drive with the latest GoT episode".

* Cheaper: Sky increased their prices recently, the Commerce Commission investigated and basically said "Sky are a monopoly and can charge whatever they want." (I'm not kidding.)

* Access to just soooo much more content than **anyone** can offer NZ consumers. 

So tell me where's the draw card for going through the piss poor selection available to NZ buyers? You've provided a poor service, years too late, and for way to much money. Then you bitch about it?

They can charge as much as they want, but unless the market things it's a fair deal it ain't going to happen. </TEXT>

It would good be for a police person to confirm, but I've seen most cars not get caught at 5-7km/h so I can only presume they're lowering the tolerance to only 4km/h and will be more vigilant in pulling you over/issuing a fine? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Just want to let /r/NewZealand know about Neighbourly.co.nz a private (NZ only) community based website for local events and happenings. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-04-02 02:12:30 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi /r/NewZealand,

Neighbourly.co.nz is a Fairfax run community congregation website designed to help connect neighbours communicate and keep in touch about local events and goings on. 

Local area events like:

* BBQ's 
* Work wanted
* Local fairs
* Garage sales
* Community events like Street Parties
Etc.

This is all dependent upon local involvement, obviously someone needs to post these events, but as it's been out for a wee while now, and thanks to advertising drives it is getting more and more popular, so while there may not be much happening in your area it's worth sticking with it. 

My sister in Wellington really waxed lyrical about it so thought it was worth a go so I signed up recently and was quite surprised with the amount of people in my area using it. 

Depending on your local politician and police involvement you can also receive alerts like local burgarlies and political speaking events in your area as well.

When you sign up initially you can gain immediate access by supplying a cellphone number, but you do have limited interaction until you receive a letter by post containing your verification code as to confirm your identity and your local area. This can take a wee while. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Reading the [Wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lundy_murders) the whole affair is actually horribly hilarious in a cruel and twisted way.

Mark was found guilty in 2002. 

Sentenced to Life, minimum non-parole of 17 years.

He then appealed and this was increased to a non-parole of 20 years.

He then appealed again, and was immediately sentenced to 20 years non-parole.

**He's been found guilty THREE TIMES**

He was eligible to get out in 2019 had he been a good prisoner. Now he can't get out 'til 2022. And I wonder if the fact he still maintains his innocence will count against him in his parole hearings? </TEXT>

The only thing we can keep doing is keep reporting this kind of stuff and sign petitions to ensure there's minimal impact to the local flora and fauna (if onshore) and minimal disruption to our marine environment (if offshore.) 

Yes I would amazing if the world could suddenly perform an about turn and stop using oil etc, but the simple fact is that isn't going to happen for a few years.
