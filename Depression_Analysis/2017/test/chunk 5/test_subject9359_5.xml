	<TEXT> I have always been hairy. i have been hairy since i was 10 years old. i have tried everything. i have bleached. i have threaded. i have waxed. i have tweezed. i have used the no no hair removal system. i have tried a home laser kit. i have used scissors. i have shaved. i had professional expensive laser hair removal. i get hair everywhere. also i am indian so that makes it even worse. the doctors don't do anything. i feel so ugly. i don't know what to do anymore. i can't keep up with it. i am 27. my mum and sister get hair but its not as bad as mine. my boyfriend tells me it doesn't bother him. he says as long as he has the better beard. is there anything i haven't tried that i can do? is there any meds i can take to lessen the hair? what have you tried? how do you try and not let it get to you?  </TEXT>
