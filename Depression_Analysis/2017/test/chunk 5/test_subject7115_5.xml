	<TEXT> The Johnson's lived 30 miles away from where I grew up. President Johnson was long dead before I was born, but Lady Bird died almost 10 years back, I think back in 2004 (can't really remember). I lived in Fredericksburg, and the Johnson's in Johnson City. They attended church in Fredericksburg at St. Barnabas Episcopal Church. Lady Bird was such a nice woman. One time when I was 3 years old, we were late for church. We sat in the back row, behind Lady Bird. I was being unruly, not behaving. Mrs. Johnson turned around and told my mother what a cute child I was and asked if it would be alright if I sat with her. Needless to say, I was quiet the rest of the service. She loved kids. I bet she really was laying into her husband. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> While it may be a gimmick, she really does have enormous talent. She's just gone off the deep end, let the fame get to her head (I think at least). I'm a huge Gaga fan but you have to admit it when the people you idolize and respect lose it. I saw her in concert in 2010. She really is an amazing vocalist and her piano skills are incredible. She just needs to calm it down. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I see where you get that and I respect that being her fan. The great thing about music is that a song that can be so small and insignificant can mean so much to someone. A lot of Adele's music speaks to me on a personal level. The music helped with a lot of heartbreak. But, music is fascinating. Songs become personal, and that's the beauty. Some people enjoy it for the tune, the rhythm, the vocals, or the words, and its all about taste. Like wine. You pick and choose until you find something you like. That's how I see it all.  </TEXT>
