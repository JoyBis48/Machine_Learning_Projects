	<TEXT> Centrecom in sunshine are just as bad. I called them to check if they had a certain graphics card, was on hold for 15 minutes then was told they had plenty in stock. I told him I would be there in 30 minutes to grab it and if he could get one ready for me which was all good. Then I get there to find out they dont actually have any at all. Apparently i was the arsehole for wanting the next model up for the same price because they fucked me around.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I usually take my own outside micrometer set (0-100mm), depth micrometer set and vernier. All shops iv worked in have supplied them but its hard to keep track of the condition of the tools when everyone else is using them too. Also a dial indicator and base. Very easy for them to be damaged and no one says anything, potentially causing you trouble down the track.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It still is pretty common. I lost a friend of the family recently to dravet syndrome, she was only 11 and basically minutes after she passed there were photographers there who work for the hospital and asked the mother if she would like some photos taken, she said yes, and a few of them were actually used at her funeral.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Sensory deprivation tanks around Melbourne?  </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Basically I'm interested in having a session in a sensory deprivation tank, and would like to know if anyone here who has done it in or around Melbourne and could suggest somewhere to do it? After a quick google search most of the stuff I have found is for myotherapy and pain relief sort of thing, not sure if they would cater for someone looking to chill out.  </TEXT>
