	<TEXT> I'll always remember him as the promising young second baseman for the Yankees. I'm 22 now and some of the players who broke into the league when I started following baseball are starting to retire. It's an odd feeling. Kind of like I'm losing a part of my childhood.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I just bought a slow cooker and have been using it a lot. I'll share my most successful recipes. Here's the buffalo chicken I made tonight.


Chicken breasts (I used a little more than a pound and a half)

One bottle of buffalo wing sauce

One pack of dry ranch dressing mix


Put the chicken in the slow cooker, pour the bottle of buffalo wing sauce on the chicken and then sprinkle the ranch mix on top. Cook on high for 4-5 hours, then shred with a fork.


Next time I make this, I'll probably use less buffalo wing sauce, maybe 3/4 of a bottle.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I put chicken breasts, a can of beer and some spices in my crock pot on low for 7-8 hours. That way I can shred it and save some for future meals. I made burritos with chicken, beans and cheese. Just wrap them in foil and put them in the fridge or freeze them.

	<TEXT> I'm trying to prepare meals in advance and I also just bought a slow cooker. Yesterday I made chicken breasts and put them in burritos. It was delicious, so I wanted to share the recipe.


Place chicken breasts in slow cooker.

Add one 12 oz bottle of beer. I used Stella, but anything should work.

1/2 tsp of paprika

1/2 tsp of basil

1/2 tsp of garlic powder

1/2 tsp of salt

1/2 tsp if black pepper


Cook it on low for 7-8 hours and then use a fork to shred it. From there, you can do all kinds of stuff with it. I just made burritos with beans and cheese.


If you're like me, simplicity is the most important thing in a recipe. If something takes more than a handful of ingredients, I'm not going to make it. You could easily do this with just beer and chicken.  </TEXT>

This is right by my house and I went to high school at Placer, so I know the area well. The neighborhood behind the school has narrow streets with a lot of trees. It would be very hard to spot a suspect from a helicopter. Past the homes is the American River Canyon. This is really rocky terrain that would be difficult to maneuver quickly. However, large portions of the area do not have trees due to the once planned construction of a dam. If he wanders into this area, it would be game over. Crossing the river would be nearly impossible without being spotted by one of the helicopters.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Brothers, I come to you in a fit of rage. I had heard the fables, but until this morning I had never personally encountered a gains thief. 



I was doing warm up sets of deadlifts, hopefully working up to a new PR. When I sat down to rest between sets, some jerk comes up, doesn't say a word to me, and takes over my barbell. I'm sitting just a few feet away when this gains hog thinks he can just overtake my setup. He was pretty big, built more like a powerlifter with significant body fat, but also very strong. I was dumbfounded. So speechless I couldn't even stand up for myself. I just sat there, mouth agape and watched as this guy took the gains that rightfully belonged to me. I managed to take a picture of the guy. Hopefully he sees this and realize what a punk he is.

	<TEXT> Timmy will always be a lot of fans' favorite Giant. Not just because of what he did from 09-11 or in the 2012 playoffs, although that certainly helps, but because of his attitude. He's never complained about being sent to the bullpen or not getting enough work. He just works and pitches when he's needed.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have about 3 pounds of chicken that I need to cook and I'm wondering what the best way to do that are. In the past I've baked it and I've also experimented with grilling. Do you have a preferred way of cooking chicken?


Edit: I'll contribute an answer to my own question. I just baked 3 pounds worth at 450 degrees for 10 minutes on each side. I put a little bit of olive oil and seasoning on as well. It's pretty tasty when mixed with rice.  </TEXT>
