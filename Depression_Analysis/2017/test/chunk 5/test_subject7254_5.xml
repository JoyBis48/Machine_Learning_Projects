	<TEXT> Congratulations.  You've found the difference in incentive betwen the government and private sector.

A business operates off its own money and thus has the incentive to perform and be accountable.

The government doesn't operate off it's own money and the employees do not have any motivation to be accountable or even perform at all.

	<TEXT> All of these attacks took place in sovereign nations with responding security forces.  In these cases, unilateral intervention would be more difficult politically.  Libya, however, was in a state of civil war and unilateral action would have been the *only* security response.

Who is the only one person in the USA who can authorize military action in another nation?

Why was no rescue force ever sent while our people were in a siege and getting killed?

Why were fixed wing aircraft resting on a tarmac one hour away(Italy) never scrambled?

We did however manage to send an *unarmed* Predator.  Why did we prioritize the launch of an unarmed Predator over fixed wing assets with real bombs?

Why was the attack blamed on a video despite there being no evidence of this?

How did the White House/media know **immediately** the motivations of attackers in the middle of the night 8,000 miles away in a war torn country?  What source did they use for this?  Did they interview people?  How did they know this?

Why was a low ranking person, Susan Rice, paraded out on talk shows to blame this attack on a video?  Why not have someone that is formally in charge actually address the nation first?

TLDR: Our men fought all night long, while no one in Washington lifted a finger. The White House made up a story about a video, since this was mid-election and a terrorist attack would have been bad for Obama.
