	<TEXT> I think there's a double misunderstanding here. I assumed you were referring to the women/men finding what is rare attractive. This was my mistake as I combined your comment with someone else's. I meant that finding the 'rare' exotic and attractive is natural.

Considering women/men prey is lame with or without the mileage. But I wouldn't fault anyone for traveling far and wide to find 'love'. </TEXT>

Things like this will be helpful to know as a parent raising a female child. Not so much to protect but to be of some sensible support and compass through it all. </TEXT>

Actually, and this is backed by many published research findings, the most highly rated male is the black male. (Asian rank number one in the female category).
Being scary is a stereo type that doesn't hold true everywhere, not even everywhere in America. Please quite with the self loathing already. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Why are you discriminating against people under 18. 
To play devils advocate here, what magically happens on the eve of the 18th birthday  that 'changes everything' and makes it okay? It is a completely arbitrary age and is only a matter of time before this too is changed. 
And 'you' having or not having a 'problem with this' is not a legal argument either. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Been there. Understand and appreciate your being candid.
My initial comment was a FTFY. Well, one way of looking at it is that we both agree the current 'trend' is broken since, in a healthy society, we should be appalled by any acts of cruelty and senseless violence towards any living creature. 
That the media pushes this or that idea is one thing. This however, is reddit. "We" shape the conversation as it should be.
