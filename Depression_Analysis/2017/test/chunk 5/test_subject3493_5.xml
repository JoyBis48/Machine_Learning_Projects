	<TEXT> Where there is supply there is likely always demand,  unless something better comes along and replaces that supply On a side note is 10k that hard to get? I made about 30-40k from 1-27. And I'm not even at the recommended level for the area where vamps and wolves spawn. Play the game, enjoy the content. Rather then complaining about something so minor. It's a skill tree and a quest. Nothing more, nothing less. I say 10k cause that was the average price on pc, money isn't hard to get, its just time consuming .
EDIT: just realized my first statement doesn't really make a lot of sense, ignore it I suppose </TEXT>
