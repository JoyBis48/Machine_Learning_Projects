	<TEXT> Well, yeah, it's hard to grow a lot of it and you don't get much. However, if I'm guessing you're like me, being efficient isn't the point. The point is doing it yourself and having fun. So...

The Saffron Crocus is sterile (due to polyploidy, it's 3n); no seeds. So you can only get more bulbs from vegetative bulb division. If you get a bulb, it will slowly grow into more bulbs over time. I bought one bulb about 4 years ago and I'm up to 5. Sorry, but I'm not willing to part with any of them yet. Check [eBay](http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_sacat=0 _nkw=saffron+bulbs _frs=1) in the spring and fall. They aren't too expensive.

They are mostly grown in a Mediterranean climate and require full sun. They are short-day plants and require a specific amount of dark to flower in the fall. [Check the Bible for more culture specifics.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saffron#Cultivation) Good luck!

Edit: clarity </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would pick and toss (trash not compost) any affected leaves before planting. Then just be vigilant.

Transplants tend to be packed tightly into greenhouses for propagation. These can be hot spots for disease propagation, too. As long as your plants are not as closely packed, and you watch for problems developing, you should be OK. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's called Alternaria solani, or the causal agent of Early Blight. The angular bull's-eye shape is a classic feature. Nice photo.

Do a good clean-up in the fall to control it. But if you live somewhere humid, or your plants are very close together, it can defoliate tomatoes and potatoes. Copper fungicides are another control for the home-grower.

Good luck! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is really cool stuff. This technique could be used for all kinds of single gene diseases. Permanent cures for some kinds of deafness, color blindness, and cystic fibrosis, among others.

Another related tool could be fight specific, tenacious diseases. If you can make a worthwhile antibody in the lab that targets a conversed antigen of flu or malaria, then transvect that into a host B-cell after chromosomal rearrangement. 

Why aren't we funding science more!?!! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Fun fact, if astrology types actually looked at the sky the whole thing would fall apart. There's a 13th (Ophiuchus) because the stars have moved since the time of the Babylonians.

The planet or sun or whatever isn't even in the claimed constellation a bunch of the time.

I don't expect people to re-evaluate world views to often, but if the stars control everything, look up once in a while! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The Bruce Company is solid.

Avoid municipal mulches as they tend to be made from trees around town that have died. Many are maples dead from Verticillium wilt, a disease caused by a fungus. It can easily survive for a year or two and has a wide host range, i.e. it could kill your plants too. </TEXT>

Gymnosporangium rust. This is the telial stage which makes telialspores, which make basidiospores, which infect apples/quince/hawthorn. There are three species and they all looks really similar. They call it cedar-apple rust because you see it on junipers. </TEXT>
