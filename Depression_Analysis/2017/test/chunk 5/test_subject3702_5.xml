	<TEXT> Hi all! 

I've been living in the portland area for about a year now and last year it didn't even cross my mind that I might be able to do some winter hunting, coming from New England.

I've heard that black trumpets come up in January? Is there anything else I could keep my eyes open for?

Thanks for any help in advance! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> basically I was reading through the top comments and saw the discussion of whether Fight Club should or should not be mentioned. It had been mentioned there a few times. And then I sorted "controversial" and saw it a few more times. And so when I had landed on this particular comment I thought to myself "that is so brave." And then I said what was in my heart.

If what is in my heart is worth -3 karma, I'll take it. But just know, I died typing from the heart. </TEXT>

A little ways up there's some dude that said around the same age his english teacher bought him booze and also sexed him up a few times.

	<TEXT> As a cook, I will absolutely cook your food however you want it. But if you order a $25/30 steak well done, I will think less of whoever is behind that ticket.

It's not so much because you have tastes that are different than my own, but more of a combination of proper technique and also straight logic. 

Because let's be honest, if you're going to order that steak well done, just get a hamburger, no bun with some onions and mushrooms on top. Load it up with A1 and enjoy. 

But also because to me in my esoteric ways, ordering a steak over medium (and even medium is pushing it), is like ordering sushi quality yellowfin tuna cooked entirely through. The tuna is "supposed" to be served seared and black and blue. And arguably that's why you're eating the tuna in the first place. Otherwise, you are eating something prepared incorrectly and probably would enjoy something else more.

	<TEXT> You can't redefine veganism to fit or support your own lifestyle choices.

Vegan/vegetarian is an ethical stance.

Yes, yes it is.

Veganism (/vignzm/) is simply an extreme form of vegetarianism which eliminates any and all animal products from the diet. It can also refer to.the practice of abstaining from the use of animal products in every manner possible

oh, and more specifically,

One of the main differences between vegan and vegetarian diets is that vegan diets exclude both eggs and dairy products...

It sounds like you might be a vegetarian. </TEXT>
