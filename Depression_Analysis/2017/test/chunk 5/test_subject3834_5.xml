	<TEXT> So sarcastic and passive aggressive. You must have a really well-groomed vagina. You sorry saps are doing this to yourself, bitching like a bunch of children. I'm just calling it like I see it, but hey, if you want to join in the circle-jerk of useless whining, be my guest. Not mine or any other man'd fault that you feel inferior. Here's a tip though - doing this dear diary high-school shit on reddit isn't going to help you feel better about yourself or life here on planet-motherfucker. Good luck. I hope you can work through your neuroses and emotional problems. Be a real women or man, and face up to that shit. No one wants to deal with an adult child.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Clearly you didn't read what I wrote. It's ok though. I'm sure commiserating with your fellow hens in the sewing circle has elevated you oh so much in their eyes, and has contributed much to your well-being, never mind how pathetic this drivel sounds, and how it benefits neither sexes, nor does anything to demonstrate emotional maturity in a man. Most of you sound like chicks bitching about your so-called friends because you are too afraid to confront them, and you aren't man enough to deal with your own feelings, whatever that may entail. Frankly, it's pathetic and disgusting. Thank gosh for te anonymity of the Internet.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yep, but I hear you on the spelling/attention thing.  But even in professional fields, the standards of grammar and even things like basic sentence structure and all manners of other elements have gone to complete shit, or at least it seems that way sometimes.  Attention to details are important, and it never ceases to amaze me how many people don't pay attention, be it on their resumes, their e-mails, their text messages, or to their own goddamn life and what they are feeling and how they deal with it, period  :D


Keep up the good fight though.  I myself would allow for no more than one, two typos max on a resume ;) </TEXT>

That being said, yes, he sounds like a dick, but I love how little nuances and things that those who are hiring choose to take offense at are so subjective and dependent on their own experiences and bias.  I wonder how many people who would be perfect fits at certain jobs and companies wind up being passed over because the hiring manager/HR/boss/whatever chose something asinine to be annoyed at, or projected their own personal issues onto the hiree  :D </TEXT>

Between that, and the wintern lanters' brains being composed of seemingly dead messengers, it seems that a lot of the nightmare creatures are somehow made out of twisted/perverted messengers, which leads me to believe the messengers are messengers of the MP or some other great one, and since the great ones seem to have different methods and goals, that the Mensis school likely experimented or flat out somehow enslaved and warped some of the messengers, somehow. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Those split arcane weapons are not meant to be optimized via the arcane stat, they are meant to be maxed via the +% physical and flat arcane damage gems, as their base arcane damage is super low.


That being said, it isn't awkward, you just have to have the uncanny burial blade (cuz the regular one with waning gem slot sucks), and you can take that AR upwards of 600 relatively easy, and that is with regular depth 5 chalice drops, not the more rarer, top-of-the-line rank 20 gems or abysmal gems from bosses.  The BoM are even more OP with those odd gems, because it hits like a truck, and it hits super fast.


That being said, the problem is, it is way more work and effort to do all that, rather than say, get a ludwigs which is basically OP out the gate, even with mediocre % physical gems on it.  Plus, it can be enchanted.  This is why everyone likes and uses ludwigs - because it is easy to obtain, and easy to increase the damage with little to no chalice farming or work.  It's a total bummer that certain builds and weapons in this game are so lop-sided when it comes to optimizing them and staying competitive :( </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Riflespear is fun as shit to play with, but it is very mediocre in damage, hell, even reach, unless you are talking about the riflespear bug, which is bad to base a more permanent build around, since it will likely be fixed via patch soon enough.  I used the riflespear exclusively on my BT and SKL build characters until I obtained better weapons in late game (cuz I hate the cane), and again, while distinct and fun, the riflespear is easily outclassed in both range and damage by the axe, or ludwigs, and most anything else.  That, and if you are talking about the riflespear bug, it will likely take him awhile to get to a place to farm the correct gems to make it bugged/OP. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Right. And the arcane scaling on the split weapons is shit and not meant to be optimized via the arcane stat, and you gimp the split weapons if you only put %physical gems on them as well.  those weapons are meant to be boosted using the gems I mentioned, as the arcane stat itself makes almost no difference on them. 

The split weapons aren't suppose to be turned into pure arcane either, because they have low base arcane damage and scaling in the first place, and wind up just as gimpy if you try to use them that way. 

Edit:  the tonitrus is optimized via elemental damage gems, which are a lot harder to farm. Or at least, more obnoxious. 


Edit 2:  to be clear, I'm trying to tell you why those split weapons are the way they are, and how an and how to properly utilize their stats.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I got the perfect build for you.  It's bad-ass, sturdy, gives you access to all those tools you mentioned, and you can make several weapons ridiculously OP (though for burial blade, you need to get the uncanny version to be able to put in all +phys % gems and flat arcane damage, as the waning gem slots suck ass).  That being said, Rosmarinus wouldn't be the focus here, as you will top off at 15 arcane, though you could move the stats around, but 25 end is good to be able to use the different weapon combos out there.  Anyway, here is the awesome OP build that makes you shine for quality weapons and SKL weapons, but you could also viably use some STR weapons just for the hell of it if you didnt want to be too op:

40 Vit

25 End

25 STR

50 SKL

5 BT - dont add any into this, as you don't need it for anything, and fuck anything other than hunter's pistol anyhow for non BT builds :P

15 ARC


There is your 110 build if you start with Cruel Fate (has only 5 blood tinge).  You can adjust the Vit/end/SKL to your liking, but with this build and the correct weapons and gems, you can have a 650-700 AR Burial Blade, a 600 AR BoM, and a 850-950 AR Ludwig's (stupid, right?) with the phantasm shell.  Have fun!


Edit:  Thanks to my mate here on reddit who showed me how ridiculously awesome this quality build is :D

That being said, what all the DaS2 whiners meant (even after they played the game for hundreds and thousands of hours, and ejoyed it) is, DaS2 is a fantastic RPG game, and it was still game of the year in 2014, but it is the least souls-like of the souls games.  It is a great RPG game, just not a great FROM game :D </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Fuck all the whiners.  They still played it more than any other game out there, they still put 100's to 1000's of hours on it, and it was still the best game of 2014, hands down.  No other game, even AAA, had the same replayability and diversity DaS2 had, especially for PvP.  I love how people will say, "it's a terrible game, I only played it for 1000 hours"...  like, really?  What the fuck dude?  


But I get what they mean.  What all the DaS2 whiners are trying to say (and the best way to put it is), DaS2 is the best RPG game of all the Souls games, but it is the least Souls-like of all the souls games, or at least, the most deficient of the souls games when it comes to all the little quirks and nuances that made the souls games great.


That being said, DaS2 easily has the best PvP and matchmaking of all the games (aside soul memory), and definitely has the best variety in terms of weapons/armor (even if it is redundant), but even that is great, as the fashion options are spectacular! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The DLC in DaS was cut content that they just didn't have time to put in the original game, and that content was fantastic and worth it's entertainment dollar a hundred times over.  The DLC in DaS2 went hand-in-hand with the story, but I still think it was more of an after-thought (or at least, not like it was going to be implemented in original game), BUT, the DLC for DaS2 was the highlight of the game, with some of the best game-design and challenging bosses and some great new items and weapons.


The point is, I will buy DLC for Bloodborne in a heart-beat, whether it was intended content that was cut due to time-constraints, or an after-thought :D </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah - I hear ya on the checklist thing.  After a while it becomes mechanical, especially when you've done them on more than one character.  I actually enjoy creating my own due to the mystery of them, or trying out other people's glyphs, but the story-line chalices became redundant the second time around.  At the least, I would have enjoyed some different tile sets and lay-outs, or even more interesting would have been a wave-like enemy arena or boss challenge.  I think that would have fit just fine into the game, and really showcase the enemies as well as the player characters :D </TEXT>

That being said, decent covenants with a a slight modicum of depth would have been welcome, but as it stands, the covenants in BB are the lamest and most shallow to date.  The covenants in previous games all had motives, rewards, and mechanics related to them, and BB pretty much completely lacks that.  For that and mainly that, I am dissapointed :( </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You can't just create any random dungeon glyph (even with all necessary materials) unless you've already created a dungeon of that specification.  So if you wanted to make a 'cursed ihyll' of a specific glyph, you first have to make a 'cursed ihyll' of your own.  


Provided you have all the materials you need, you go to a blank gravestone, use 'condust chalice ritual,' option, and make the parent dungeon.  Once that dungeon is created, then you can go to another gravestone and then you can use the 'find glyph' option or whatever it's called to look up the specific dungeon you wanted to run, and you can create it, all without having to use your own materials.


So, if you wanted to run a specific 'cursed loran' glyph, you couldnt create a 'cursed isz' dungeon and expect to access cursed loran, but if you did create a cursed isz dungeon of your own, you could access any cursed isz chalice glyph out there by looking it up the same way mentioned above via glyphs.


Lastly, supposedly if you create a parent dungeon of your own, with all offerings, you can access any and ALL combination of those offerings via glyphs.  So if you created a cursed/fettid/rotten Ihyll, you could join any ihyl glyph, even if it was only 'cursed and fettid.'


Good luck~ </TEXT>

I've read up on a lot of the posts about ranges, and it being similar to invading further upwards beyond the original DaS equation (akin to DaS2), but even then, I know there are a lot of stubborn people sticking to 50-80, but I suppose that is why a lot of us make multiple characters at multiple ranges :D


But I also have the urge to make a new character anyhow, because I enjoy creating them, and I have this really bad-ass Lemmy Kilmister character model saved that I want to employ as more of a main character, as I have thoroughly been enjoying the SKL build, but I think it would be fun to bring the STR up to 25 for additional weapon usage.

	<TEXT> Right, but all the work to get that far and farm that much at chances to even get an abysmal gem, let alone one with perfect stats, for just one weapon?  Well, that is why people flock to using Ludwig's sword, because it is OP real quick with minimal investment in the game or farming, and it's bad-ass even with the base game gems.  


I'm super annoyed and dissapointed in how FROM made competitive weapon optimizing so lop-sided, and it's a total bummer that they made it so hard to maximize a lot of weapon's potential (ie, the uncanny burial blade, as the waning slot ruins the base-line model).  


I mean, I have multiple characters, and I've farmed a lot of chalices, and I have yet to see an abyssmal gem period 


Edit:  And that's not to say it shouldn't take farming/work/effort/frustration/redundancy to optimize our theoretical top-shelf OP Tonitrus that we've been discussing, but it's a lot of work to make simple/earlier game weapons shine, like the BoM and later the Burial Blade, and use it to its max :/ </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have a few PvP builds, and the most current/closest one I am using is similar to yours, though I had planned it to be primarily dex, but I wanted to make a quality build anyhow, so now I just feel like I could have the best of both worlds on one toon.  Anyway, Nathan Explosion is level 98, and his stats are:

45 Vit (I think, might be 44 or 46)

22 End

12 STR

50 SKL

8 BT (whatever starter stat was)

15 Arc


I mean, I could easily adjust it to make it closer to a quality build, but I think anything over 100-110 is too high, as it cuts out a lot of meta-ranges in PvP, and is frankly just unnecessary, as I enjoy focused builds where you have to sacrafice some power/expertise over others. </TEXT>

Anyway, I ask because I wanted to make a quality build for PvP to have access to a variety of weapons (as variety is what has always made the souls games fun as fuck), yet remain competitive - so I wanted to use ludwig's (which I never really liked that much), the cleavers, and hearing that tonitrus can be pretty bad-ass on a quality build makes me happy as well :D

I've been farming those flat arc gems, but so far no luck, because I keep getting the shitty -HP gems, though the few -kin/beast damage are great for PvP.


Do you use the regular burial blade with its shitty waning slot, or do you use an uncanny burial blade?  Or  As it seems it would be able to possibly pump out the most damage (2 radial and a triangle gem slot) since triangle gems come as +9% physical with the +70 flat arcane damage, whereas, it's hard to find a decent waning gem for the burial blade, or at least, so far it has been, and I have that 18% physical gem found in the main game on it. </TEXT>
