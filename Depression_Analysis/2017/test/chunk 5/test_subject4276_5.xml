1. Thanks I'll take extra care for that bit

2. Hmm I've never heard anyone say they had that problem with the slim armor case before. I'm not worried about bulk because it looks about the same as the supcase I already have, and I like the look of the slim armor. I'd get the ultra hybrid because I don't drop my phone but I drive a big rig so I don't want to risk it falling from that height without proper protection. 

3. I don't exactly like the look of full body skins, I was thinking something clear. I'm just worried about scuffing my phone while it's in the case because the one I'm replacing got scuffs from the supcase

Thanks for the tips </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Replacement M8 on the way, wondering about body skins </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-01-11 07:02:56 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm getting my M8 replaced because of a cracked camera lens. Since I'm doing the advanced exchange program I will be losing my tempered glass screen protector, just the price I pay for not wanting to be without my m8 for lore than an hour. 

I currently have the supcase because I thought I would end up using the IR blaster a lot but I haven't been at all so I'm ordering the spigen slim armor case and a nilkin tempered glass protector since it also comes with one's for the camera lenses. 

That leads me into my question: what about full body skins? Even with my supcase on, dirt and dust gets inside and I have scuffs on the edges of my phone that I'd rather not have. Anyone use a full body skin in addition to a shell case? </TEXT>

I go home and shower before I contaminate anything else because that's disgusting and why do I need to soil two sets of clothes? For professionalism? I think you have that backwards unless you park underground and have a secret entrance where customers don't see you. Some restaurants make you walk through the front door. I think it's more professional to show up ready to work. But yeah you have fun changing in that handicap stall or better yet, the tiny stall if the handicap one is taken.  </TEXT>

My parents got me chains for my tires years ago but I haven't used them in over 5 or 6 years because I haven't needed them, even with how bad the last few winters were. I've never worn boots unless I'm hunting, I dress in pants, a t-shirt and a decent coat and I've only recently started wearing a hat now that I've elected to shaving my hair.

Winter is doable without having extreme gear but I suppose it may be necessary for people not used to the cold weather up here since how temperature seems to be perceived is relative to what you're used to </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks. I was also looking into locking casters because I also have a small work area. My toolbox is on casters and can be moved. 

We also looked at a bench at Sam's club. Basically it's a nice big flat top with metal supports and legs. Half of my toolbox can roll underneath it, the other half I'd have to mount on a board with casters to fit it underneath. 

The pros are it would free up some workspace having the toolboxes underneath it, and it's obviously sturdier. The cons are that I'd have to drill my own bench dog holes, get my own vice to attach to it, and with the legs being metal, I might not be able to attach casters to it </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I haven't done it yet as I've lived in apartments but a future project in my parents house will be just that. We did a complete remodel of one of the TV rooms and set that up for multiple cat5e cables in two areas where they could possibly hang a TV. The house has a specific design where we are able to run several lines through a pipe into the attic from the basement and from there lines were dropped and pulled down to the top floor rooms where there are existing phone or power lines. The rest of the house aside from the one that was already torn up can have lines be pushed up from the basement. In most houses you would end up needing to tear up sections of your drywall and repair them to run cables.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I just don't know how it can be programmed for so many variables like that. Just in my small town, there is parallel parking downtown, and some side streets have diagonal parking along the street. Then there are limitations on how far away from a corner you can be, or you can't Park in front of a fire hydrant, or there could be an alley access. Unless there is a universal parking method everywhere, I can't see the possibility of taking the human out of the equation.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Where your coax line comes in for the Internet, you'll want a router. If it's a convenient location you can have a wireless router there. Then from that wire you'll want to connect to a gigabit switch and then from that switch you'll run cat5/6 to all your rooms. If you need more devices in certain rooms you can either run multiple wires or you can have a small switch in the rooms you need more wires in. Myself personally, I'd rather have a big switch and run all the wires to it rather than have 4 switches. Yes, you'll need power to the switch. Just remember: only one router. 

The common setup I hear of is having a non-wireless router where the coax comes in, and then you put one or two wireless access points throughout the house from the switch.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Little Ricky has hated swaddling since month 1.5-2. Sometimes sleep sacks work if we don't put his arms through the holes but a lot of the time he gets upset that his arms aren't free so the only option sometimes is to hold your hand there and keep him from knocking the pacifier out until he drifts asleep. We contemplated getting that thing we saw on Shark Tank which is essentially like a sleep sack but with no arm holes and just extra room where the holes would be so he isn't cramped up but I'll be damned if we have to spend $40 on something like that when we could buy a yard of baby plaid for like $5 and make one ourselves. Luckily it isn't big enough of an issue to resort to that </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't mind it really. I remember Dragon Age Origins having an awful inventory and the original mass effect was a nightmare. I can definitely see the inventory being cumbersome on PC. I can also understand where they're coming from with the random valuables dropping from enemies. It always feels tacky to me when things like demons or mabari drop gold, so selling those for gold makes sense. 

That being said, there's no excuse for not having any sort of storage in your stronghold, especially for a game that requires you to collect so many crafting materials in order to upgrade potions, armor, and weapons weapons, as well as re-equipping any potion that isn't your standard healing potion </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think something I really miss is the quick weapons toggle in Dragon Age Origins. They combined a lot of the good things about both games but a few are still gone. I liked that I could have two different sets of weapons and skills equipped to the skill buttons so I could change weapon sets mid combat. Like let's say my rogue was sitting back and shooting arrows and suddenly I'm the target, I switch to knives and fight close combat now. Someone correct me if I'm wrong but I also thought origins had different arrows with different abilities you could equip. 

Another thing I miss is having access to every skill in your party via the skill wheel.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The first question you'd need to ask is if it's possible for him to work 50 hours per week. Overtime is becoming increasingly rare for hourly employees, employers would rather put employees on salary and make then work 60 hours per week since they don't have to pay overtime that way. 

Is 50 hours sustainable long term? The employer could say yes but then after a month or two decide to cut back.

Lastly, I feel there would have to be some compromise with your husband. It's great that you want to have more direct control over your child! But your husband is basically going to be working an extra 2 hours per day, so if he was 9-5, now he's working 9-7. I work 5 days a week but it's hours based on the work being done, basically I work until I'm done. I know what a huge difference an 8 hour day versus a 10 hour day can be. It feels like it takes longer to unwind at home and when you're finished with dinner it seems like it's bed time already. 

That all being said, I think having one parent being at home until they're old enough to be in school is the best situation. Daycares are so expensive and it seems like unless both parents have a good paying full time job, daycare isn't even worth it. My wife asked if she should go back to working but any money she'd make would go back into child care so I'd rather have her have all that bonding time with our son </TEXT>
