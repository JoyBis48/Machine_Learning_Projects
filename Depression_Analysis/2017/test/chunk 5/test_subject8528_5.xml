Basically, /u/IHaveAGloriousBeard, is wishing that it was easier to get housing in the game for the ability to have a space to be creative is what intrigues him about MMOs.

My guess is that they wish housing was cheaper than it is, or didin't require an obscene amount of time to get to the point that you can own housing in the game. </TEXT>

So to get more out of it, try the trial and get up to 20 in as many classes as possible (or that you want) and then add the 1 month subscription. </TEXT>

One cool thing about FFXIV, that I have gleaned from the trial, is that one character can be all of the classes and they level/spec differently. (Even better is that you can share some abilities with other classes such as being an archer but using the archanist's physick for healing) </TEXT>

Also, it is a really good show for MMO players as they use different mechanics such as the idea of cooldowns and effects and what not.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Clarification on flairs </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-12-31 17:42:58 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> [](#meta)

With the recent influx of posts with incorrect flair, I'd like to clarify the definitions of the various flair/tags.


##Which flair should I use?

Flair type | Description | Example 1 | Example 2
:--|:--|:--|:--
**Request** | Requesting anime based on information you provide | "Anime where the main character stops taking crap from the tsundere heroine and starts to dislike her?" | "I loved Mirai Nikki. Any suggestions?"
**Suggestion** | Suggesting anime to others | "Psycho-Pass is a 2012 show written by Urobochi Gen. It is a smart, dark sci-fi criminal story set in weird utopia/dystopia. The protagonist is a rookie cop on hunt for a serial killer." | "If you like Asimov, robotics, or Spielberg's A.I., watch Eve no Jikan"
**Manga/LN/VN** | Requests or suggestions specifically about manga, light novels, or visual novels | "Manga in which the characters go to the Moon and has some romance?" | "I enjoyed Katawa Shoujo, what other VNs would be good to play?"
**Identification **\* | Help identifying something (a gif, something from your memory, etc.) | "Help me ID an anime with man wrestling a deer." | "Anyone know what anime this GIF is from. It consists of a stylist who is working on a panda."
**Question** | General questions about a series| "In what order should I watch Ghost in the Shell?"| "Steins;Gate: English dubbed or subbed?"
**Meta** | Posts that discuss the subreddit itself| "Guide to tagging your post with flair"| "Just want to say it's nice to see the consistent suggestion posts and also want to welcome new frequent posters! Keep it up!"

\* When you submit an identification link, choose the `Identification ` flair. When someone answers your question, change it to `Identification ` so that users may know that your question has been solved.

---
To tag your post on mobile, you must have a special code **in the body of your post** when you submit.

Flair type | Code
:--|:--
[Request]|**[]\(#request)**
[Suggestion]|**[]\(#suggestion)**
[Manga/LN/VN]|**[]\(#manga)**
[Identification]|**[]\(#identification)**
[Question]|**[]\(#question)**
[Meta]|**[]\(#meta)** </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm really new to MMOs in general and I am trying the free trial. I see that if you don't buy the full version of the game within 90 days you lose your data.

If I do decide to upgrade, is there still a time limit for resubbing without losing your data/character(s)? (I'm asking because I am a college student and the semester starts soon. I might have more time over the summer to play which could warrant resubbing but I don't want to buy the game if there is still the possibility of losing my characters) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You could definitely make some money running those sites but you might want to look into selling the stories in example 1, linking to Amazon using an affiliate link in #2 and just having a good site in #3 to improve your income.

I, personally, make some money using adsense on my youtube channel but it isn't much. (That is also my fault for not growing/establishing an identity and not really editing my videos)

I cannot go into, minute, detail about my earnings but I have been paid twice.

You need to earn $100 in your adsense account before you cash out. You can set the type of ads that you want on each site individually. (I think... It has been awhile since I checked my account) </TEXT>

I have gone ahead and done so there isn't a need to do so for this one.

	<TITLE> [SIB] Guild Wars 2 if I am new to MMO's but interested? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-12-22 07:14:01 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I've been interested in Guild Wars 2 as an MMO since there isn't a need for a subscription but it doesn't seem to be bogged down by a pay to win cash shop like the "free"-to-play MMO's that are out there.

Part of my renewed interest in the game is that it is, currently, on sale over at Amazon and I was given a gift card for there and I could download it. Another part is due to watching Log Horizon which is the story of seasoned MMO players getting stuck in the MMO and their adaption, and the viewer's subsequent introduction, to the world which looks and operates much like an MMO. (It is actually a pretty good watch too, but I digress.)

A few questions I have:

* How is it holding up? (I know it came out a few years ago)

* How friendly is it to a new player? (This not only be how the game is for new folk, but also the reaction of the community to someone who is new)

* How big/organized are the quests/raids?

* What do you think of it?

I was really annoyed as it took me awhile to find a maneuver that did what I needed on that mission and I didn't have an autosave that was recent.

I really wish there was a way to have the game pause when it is minimized. </TEXT>

What isn't pictured is the time I missed the Mun, the time I crashed right into it, the time where I didn't give enough time to decelerate, and the time where I ended up in an orbit around the Mun.

I just got back into KSP last night and now that my finals are over, I'll try to do more and more complicated stuff.
