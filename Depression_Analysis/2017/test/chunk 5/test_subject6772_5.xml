	<TEXT> Why? Maybe because you have access to more information. I am in the US and I watched the entire 7 hour house of commons discussion on gay marriage. It was illuminating. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZNpzdkzWIA

Having access to views other than you own can be a freeing thing. Some though don't want their views challenged and rely solely on 'faith'. 

Conservatives don't generally like facts - hence why they want text books not to mention evolution, cut library funding, why they only listen to those who espouse their own 'beliefs'. The internet opens up the world to a sharing of information and knowledge - which directly challenges conservatives and is one reason they don't like it and find it 'liberal'. Facts aren't liberal, but the right sure does like to call em that. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Consider this. One of the things they often ask (not saying always, honestly not sure but I have seen it asked on the forms) is if you have ever had sex with another male. Suppose you were molested as a kid/teen. You answer yes and suddenly your aren't able to donate/sell blood. 

It was (last time I looked) overly broad. Not to mention you could be much older and you fooled around when you were a teen, etc and so on.

Broad policy is too broad. It's as simple as that.

Gays in the military, something done with health care (though not single payer), leaving Iraq, not going to war in Syria and Iran...plenty of positive compared to if we had a republican in power.

I am an independent who leaned republican in the 80's an 90's - but since then repubs have went batshit crazy. George Bush was worst president in my 50 years of life and I can't imagine someone like cruz being president.

I'll take a bad dem over anything the crazy party has to offer any day. Hell, I'd take UK's David Cameron over any US person currently running on the repub side.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  *Blacks and Latinos make up just more than a third of the citys population, yet those groups made up nearly two-thirds of the citys traffic stops, including searches.*

I am guessing that if they stopped and searched people of other races the same amount they might find the same issues that crop up here. 

 Cordell shows that police have pulled over, searched and handcuffed blacks and Latinos at higher rates last year than their share of the citys overall population.

When you grow up in an area like this and you are stopped more often than whites, cuffed, etc, it may have some affect on you. If 10% of the people driving have an open container, pot, etc in the car and you pull over one race more than another...chances are you will get more of that race going to jail. Which then leads people to say "See, higher crime, more cops there to catch them!" which just feeds the original problem. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I wonder if they spend much time talking about how Laura Bush killed someone and how she felt about that? Probably not - because, as I recall, after the bush failure and 9/11 happened the right was telling us that we needed to be real Americans/Patriots and stand behind Bush.

They don't like Obama because he beat them twice, which has really brought out the nutcases. Look at their reactions to 9/11 and Beghazi as but one example out of hundreds. It's not rational - it requires people to be emotionally unsettled.

They let hate fuel them and toss out their principles in favor of it. They rally behind theocracy loving people like ted cruz and act like and American isis because they fear god will send hurricanes/etc on America because gay marriage. That is not rational - but they firmly believe god himself cares and will punish America. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Conservatives lose on the issues and logic, so they appeal to baser things like emotion. Look at the whole Benghazi debacle - been investigate and it hurt their feelings that it didn't find what they had all been claiming. So they cried a lot and investigated more. And they keep doing it.

They emotionally got behind an Iraq war, believed lies, and cheered on expansion of powers for the government with patriot act/tsa/etc. It made them feel patriotic (compare to the ACA, they love to call it Obama care, but the Patriot act they shy away from connecting bush to).

Another emotion they live with is fear. They are afraid of immigrants, isis, blacks, and non-christian people. People like Rush and Hannity know this and play on those fears - and cons tune in en masse to be preached to by father figures who tell them everything will be alright if just pray, wave flags, buy more bombs, and help less people in need. </TEXT>

Going by their views divorced people shouldn't be allowed to marry, non believers to believers, etc and so on.

I don't get it. Well, I kind of do. These super smart people are sure that God will rain down destruction on the US if gays can marry (even though they can in many countries). God doesn't care about the sick and poor being screwed over, wars like Iraq, crime, and so on. Nope. Just gays.

Your god sucks and you don't truly believe in him (Heck, based on the fundies we don't need a military, God will just swoop down and destroy the bad people....oh wait...the right pushes for more military. Maybe because they think their god is a wimp?) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes...It will liberate you from your rights, your lands, your own religious ideals, and in some cases - your life.

It is interesting, to me anyway, how the rw fundies in this country now claim that Christianity is 'better' and more liberal than it was before (which they state when talking about Islam/Isis/etc).

Which basically says: "Yeah, we changed our faith and beliefs, but we won't do that now. And we believe that other faiths aren't as advanced/liberal as ours is now. But we hate liberals and progressive ideals."

Your faith was wrong before, you reformed it time and time again, and yet now you think it is all ok and doesn't need to change anymore. I am a little skeptical. </TEXT>

Fox isn't really 'reporting' on it. They grabbed a little blurb from another site and pushed that narrative with no context (which they don't need, most fox viewers just need headlines and a blurb and they are sold on something). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Difference is - this guy doesn't represent most on the left. The right is a small tent made up of fundies and people who all think mostly alike. Hate muslims, don't want to allow their fellow american citizens (gays) to serve their country or get married, think all poor people are lazy welfare bums, etc.

I can find wackos on the left to be sure (am an independent and have been registered so since 1984 - though I did vote for both reagan and bush) but they represent less of the group because there is less group think on the left and more fractured 'tents' (some are pro gun, some anti, some religious, some not, etc and so on).

Pick any given conservative and you will find they represent a large chunk of them.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> SO, some guy I have never heard of says something silly and fox blows their dog whistle for their obedient, mindless, folks and they come running.

Man...they know how to manipulate their audience very well (not hard when their thinking skills boil down to 'someone with red/white/blue in their newscasts told me what I believe!') </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The things which are harming Americans the GOP loves and embraces by blaming those people for it.

The things we already have defense against and aren't killing us they want to spend money on.

All in the name of Jesus. Because we all know true conservative fundies believe you can pray away sickness, being homeless, hungry etc - but you can't rely on a weak god to protect you so you have to spend money on weapons. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, since women are physically different than men I can see some of their uniforms reflecting that. The universe isn't unisex. I am guessing fat storm troopers would need a modified uniform as well - but we only ever see thin guys in them. Diversity is lacking at times in that regards :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't see the 'sexualized' part of it. Do some people think that a woman can't be both appealing (to some anyway) and a storm trooper? That seems a tad prejudiced IMHO. 

"Oh hey, you look pretty and have a nice body, therefore you should be working in the Cantina serving drinks to space pirates."

Yeah. No. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sure. Soon as we stop waving it every time we kill people we don't like in wars started on lies, when we stop torturing people and acting like animals, and when it means something decent and not screw the gays, the poor, the sick. 

I think the flag is used too much by people as a blinder. It is like when they turn on fox news and are blasted with red/white/blue which is code for 'it's ok to lie, just look at these colors and you will believe'.  </TEXT>
