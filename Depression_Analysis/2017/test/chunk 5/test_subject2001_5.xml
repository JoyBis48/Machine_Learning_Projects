	<TEXT> I have a feeling the performance will be great, but the movie will get 50/50 reviews. Plus the director isn't known for making Oscar bait films, and if Nightcrawler didn't nab him at least a nomination, i don't  see how this will. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We've made quite a few moves improving our defense this off season, which is great, but the only problem is last year, while defense was a major concern, our offense was pretty abysmal. Obviously the team isn't going to be perfected in one off season, plus McCloughan still needs time to gather talent, but barring a breakout from RG3 (please!) were not going very far (which is expected already). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm interested what the QB situation is going to be. I don't just want RGIII to get the job without showing that he is indeed our best chance at winning. I think he's our best option right now, but if Cousins shows he's the superior option, let him play, if not Rg3 can prove himself. </TEXT>
