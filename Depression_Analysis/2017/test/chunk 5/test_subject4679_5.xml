	<TEXT> Most comparisons suggest that self-care approaches are a bit less effective than direct face-to-face therapy, but some show no real difference. And most self-care approaches are pretty weak entities (the largest body of work has to do with the impact of being told "Go read this self-help book"). We spend a lot of time worrying about face-to-face effectiveness, but our other approaches are generally fairly primitive.

I suppose my point is that there is a logical fallacy in some of the reasoning around the importance of the alliance. Studies do show that in face to face therapy the quality of the alliance is a (actually 'the') major determinant of outcome.

The fallacy is assuming that the presence of a relationship is therefore essential. This entails a hidden assumption that the relationship "adds" something important.

But the research showing the importance of the alliance in face-to-face outcome doesn't address the importance of having a therapist in the room. It simply says IF there is a therapist in the room, the quality of the relationship is important.

I'm raising the possibility that one reason the alliance is important is that a poor one (or a poor therapist) can degrade the experience below that of a non-face-to-face form of therapy. So one could as easily say that having a therapist in the room is a risk as a benefit.

My guess is that a face to face encounter is generally a positive addition to therapy, but that the much of the variability in outcome has to do with decrements brought about by the alliance, not just benefits. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm a psychologist and author (The Assertiveness Workbook, Your Depression Map) and would appreciate some help. 

People often spend a huge amount of effort trying to feel better and feel that their progress is slow or nonexistent. But what if the goal was to go the other way - what would you do?

Imagine that 10 days from now you could win a large sum of money (in my groups, we make it $10 million - what the heck, it's imaginary) if you could make yourself MORE unhappy for that 10th day than you have been for the past week.

The fine print: You can only do or change three things in your mind or life. And you can't list anything that's not in your own power to do (no alien invasions, no global economic meltdowns). We give you 10 days, because maybe some of your strategies won't work right away and require some time to build up. I may quote your replies but will not mention your identity in a writeup.

I know, I know: No amount of money is worth it, etc. But thankfully it's a thought experiment, not a contract. And sometimes looking at what we could be doing to make it worse (and aren't) can help us see what we are actually accomplishing.

Anyway, that's my pitch. Thanks for reading. And for getting this far: Here's a free coupon code valid til July 10 - "canadaday" - for my online course in diaphragmatic breathing, Breathing Made Easy (the usual price is a big $15). Link:  https://www.udemy.com/breathing-made-easy/
