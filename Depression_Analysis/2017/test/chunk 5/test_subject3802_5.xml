	<TEXT> The inverse of this (for nice little old ladies who are exceptionally polite and friendly): when they ask for the senior discount and present their senior's card, I take the card and squint at it and bring it close to my eyes and then look between the card and the old lady and say "I don't know.... you don't look like a senior to me." with a wink to go with it. Always gets a chuckle from them.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Its been explained time and time again, but people like you keep using the wrong argument. Skins exist not because manufacturers don't like the look of stock android and think they can do better. They exist to create brand loyalty. Blur only exists on Motorola devices, and if someone's mom only feels comfortable with blur and everything else looks different and confusing, what do you think her next phone is going to be? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Are you joking? Reddit sync lacks so many features compared to Alien blue. Its comparable to using res on the desktop and many people I know who have it on their iPad would actually prefer to use Alien Blue than their desktop browser. 

Reddit sync is good, and so is Reddit news (RN is better IMHO) but neither of them even come close to Alien Blue.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is frequently discussed in this subreddit and various other related forums. For devices that don't come stock with AOSP, the stock ROM will *always* have superior camera quality. This is simply due to the fact that the manufacturer has access to hardware binaries that indie devs do not. There is nothing you can do. If image quality is important to you, then you best switch to a stock-based ROM.

	<TEXT> I didn't actually read the post. The whole issue doesn't actually bother me at all, I for one love the idea of including a File Manager and I'm in love with the UI. I was just providing the opposing opinion for the sake of discussion - and to say that bloat doesn't always mean a large filesize (although the two often go hand in hand). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Bloat doesn't necessarily mean size, although I get where you're going with that. It more about whether or not its necessary. CM has functioned fine without a file explorer for all this time and nobody has complained or asked for one (that I've heard of anyway). I personally don't mind but its about the philosophy that cm has had up until now - people put cm on their phones to *remove* bloat and only have the absolute bare necessities on a fresh install, with the ability to install what they need/want afterwards. Including a file manager in cm assumes that *every single person that uses cm* will want and use it. Its not a safe assumption to make.

Plus, when do you draw the line? Would having a lightweight PDF viewer be considered bloat? How about a full-fledged eBook reader and manager? By adding a file manager to the default install, cm have changed their stance about bloatware from very clear to blurry and uncertain. Its not about the file manager, or the size of the apk. Its confusing their philosophy.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Direct quote from the link in your own comment:
Android 4.1, Jelly Bean, is the fastest and smoothest version of Android yet. Jelly Bean improves on the simplicity and beauty of Android 4.0, and introduces a new Google search experience on Android.

Everything in Jelly Bean feels fast, fluid, and smooth. Moving between home screens and switching between apps is effortless, like turning pages in a book.
Jelly Bean features improved performance throughout the system, including faster orientation changes, faster responses when switching between recent apps, and smoother and more consistent rendering across the system through vsync and triple buffering.
Jelly Bean has more reactive and uniform touch responses, and makes your device even more responsive by boosting your device's CPU instantly when you touch the screen, and turns it down when you don't need it to improve battery life.

JB definitely *did* bring system-wide optimisations. It was the entire point of the release - to speed things up. Did you not hear anything about "Project Butter?" there was a 15 minute keynote on the damn thing.... JB should *definitely* be noticeably snappier. </TEXT>
