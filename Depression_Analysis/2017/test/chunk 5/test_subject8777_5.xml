	<TEXT> Thank you, ya sometimes it is hard to find that balance. With this genre of music there tends to be a lot of repetitiousness and so we try not to do too much of it because without lyrics it can start to get monotonous. Thank you for the feed back tho! Take a listen to our newest song, it is our Frankenstein song with some post rock, math rock and post hardcore influence [Caterpillar Harvest](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BIdyxmSiV0) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The structure of the song is good and the lyrical content is there, but as at as the mix goes there are a couple things that could be done. I am glad to see you are a fellow logic user tho :) the vocals sound like they could be compressed a little more, just to smooth them out and sit them in the mix a little nicer. The snare also seems to have a bit of a long tail on the reverb when it is hit, or it could be the natural decay of the snare, but either way tightening up a gate a little on it might make it sound a little less muddy..but then again sometimes that's nice to have. </TEXT>

You sound a bit like [MC Paul Barman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MC_Paul_Barman) and [Atmosphere](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_(music_group) the lyrics are good with a good sense of timing about them. Te beat is pretty good too just needs to have the drums drop in a little harder! I'd love to put some drums to this track! Nicely done, hope to hear more! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This track sounds real good! The drops are solid and the build ups are nice and fluid..I get a little bit of some weird phantom frequencies around the 2-3k range but I am also listening with Grado's and they hear everything too well haha... Maybe try side chaining an low end oscillator to your kick on the drops to give it a little more DROP.. The track is awesome tho man, quite the listening experience! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I like the track very different sounding..the only thing I would say is with the way that the vocals are mixed, very light and airy with tons of reverb, I almost wanted to hear some solid drums in the track, at least something at would drop at some point, just to give the track some continuity...nothing to crazy but a simple electronic beat or a minimal DnB beat would suffice, just because it feels as tho that would keep the interest of the listener a little more, but that's just IMHO. Keep up the good work! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Just listened to the song and I really like the guitar work..it is busy bt not overwhelming which is what I like... I think if you were to find the right drummer for it to keep it busy and interesting bt at the same time able to come back to a solid rhythm, I think the song could have a real math/indie rock feel to it...I am a drummer and would love to record something to it for fun! I will definitely be jamming to it later either way! </TEXT>
