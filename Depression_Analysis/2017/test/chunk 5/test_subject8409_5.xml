	<TEXT> When people write about the phenomenon, they tend to focus on rocknroll, but a lot of Russian music that people had grown up with was also banned. Theres a Ukrainian singer called Pyotr Leshchenko  a Russian emigre who specialised in South American tango and gypsy music. After the second world war, when his music was outlawed, people would have to tune in to stations like Radio Tehran to hear his songs. The authorities set themselves too huge a task ultimately. You had popular Russian tunes that were classified as criminal songs, but they werent really. They were just regarded as low culture.

	<TEXT> Made a mistake. He's listening to a recording not having doing a voice recording.

Title from information supplied by American Folklife Center staff. Title was formerly "Piegan Indian, Mountain Chief, having his voice recorded by ethnologist Frances Densmore," but American Folklife Center staff determined that the photo shows a playback horn on the cylinder recorder, so Mountain Chief and Densmore are listening rather than recording (12/2013).

Assalamu Alaikum

Update regarding shooting death of Ahmed Al Jumaili in North Dallas:

I had an opportunity to meet with the family of Ahmed to discuss the incident that led to his death last night. 

Imam Shpendim Nadzaku and Attorney Shayan Elahi accompanied me in the 2 meetings we held. May Allah reward both of them. Their support was invaluable. Here is what we learned:

-Ahmed Al Jumaili, 36, just immigrated from Iraq 20 days ago

 - The perpetrators were 5-6 young AfAm males

 - The shot that killed Ahmed entered the side of a pickup truck bed and cleared through the other side striking Ahmed in the chest as he hid behind the truck. *see picture*

- There was nothing said to Ahmed or his wife and her brother by the perpetrators in advance of the shots. Including no verbal insults or derogatory slurs.

- They do not wear clothing that would indicate their ethnic or religious identity and Ahmed's wife, Zahra, was wearing a winter hat that concealed her hijab.

- The family is understandably traumatized and is in need of community support. Emotionally as well as financially. They are refugees from Iraq and only Mohamed, Zahra's father, is working.
After meeting with them I do not believe there is enough evidence to indicate that this was a hate crime. Thanks to Sana Syed, the PIO and our contact for the City of Dallas, I was able to speak with Major Jeff Cotner with DPD Homicide and here is what I learned:

- They have not completely ruled out a hate crime but the evidence does not indicate Ahmed was specifically targeted.

- The perpetrators have not been caught but they have some concrete leads. If anyone is interested in sponsoring a reward to help find these murderers they would be interested to discuss.

- They need the community's help is submitting information that could lead to the arrests.

In my assessment I truly believe that the DPD is doing everything they can to solve this crime completely. We have exchanged contact info and he was very grateful for our support.

Attached is an image of the bullet exit hole that left the truck and struck Ahmed in the chest resulting in his death as well as a lovely picture of Ahmed and his wife Zahra.

"Inna Lillahi wa Inna Lillayhi Raja'oon - Verily we are from God and to Him we shall all return." Please pray for this family. This death was so violent and traumatic. We should rally around them in this difficult time.
Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns that I may help with.

	<TEXT> Many newspapers from 1933-34 including the [The Pittsburgh Press - Jan 5, 1934](http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1144 dat=19340105 id=-1kdAAAAIBAJ sjid=qY4EAAAAIBAJ pg=3994,1240196) write that Captain Kahn had the creature stuffed for exhibition. It wasn't a recreation. 


While getting ready to fish for porgy several miles offshore, A. L. Kahn, a manufacturer, tossed an anchor from his small motorboat. The anchor went down and down - and right into one of the gills of the giant Manta. After a battle of several hours a coast guard vessel came along and hoisted Kahn, his motorboat and the devil-fish aboard and brought them to port. Kahn (now Captain Kahn) **had the creature stuffed** and became a showman. Says it beats the manufacturing business all hollow.

	<TEXT> He is mistaken. **A. L. Kahn had the captured manta stuffed and hung it up for exhibition.**


This appeared in many newspapers in 1933-1934

But the star of the exhibition is a local luminary - a 5,000-pound devil fish that proves New York's most amazing fish story.

While getting ready to fish for porgy several miles offshore, A. L. Kahn, a manufacturer, tossed an anchor from his small motorboat. The anchor went down and down - and right into one of the gills of the giant Manta. After a battle of several hours a coast guard vessel came along and hoisted Kahn, his motorboat and the devil-fish aboard and brought them to port. Kahn (now Captain Kahn) **had the creature stuffed** and became a showman. Says it beats the manufacturing business all hollow.

A Giant Manta Devil Fish became entangled in the anchor rope of Captain A. L. Kahns fishing boat while he was angling just off the shore of New Jersey, almost capsizing the heavy boat.
A Coast Guard vessel came to the rescue, and killed the 5,000-pound monster Manta Birostris with 22 shots from a high-powered rifle. The sail-like fish has been mounted and placed on exhibition by Captain Kahn.
An 18-inch baby Manta was born shortly after the mother fish was dragged ashore. These huge rays are seldom seen, since they live in the deepest parts of the sea.

GREAT MANTA, Brielle, NJ  1933 GREAT MANTA, Brielle, NJ  1933
This signed photo postcard shows "THE GREAT MANTA" that was captured by Captain A.L. Kahn on August 26, 1933. The huge ray was reported to have weighed over 5,000 pounds and measured more than 20 feet across the wing. The critter was caught when it became fouled in the anchor line of the "MISS PENSACOLA II" and was unable to free itself. The ray was towed to Feuerbach and Hansen's Marina in Brielle, New Jersey where it was hoisted ashore with a travel lift.
