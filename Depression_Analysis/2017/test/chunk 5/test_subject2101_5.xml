	<TITLE> Problem with post-type sprites in 3.2 new setup </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-05-23 01:43:55 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I've been working on a new subreddit using Naut 3.2 (I'm a Naut newb), and testing how things look/work.  I'm stuck confirming that certain sprites used for types of posts are working properly:

1. **self-post** (grey speech icon [OK])
1. **link-post** (globe icon [*not* OK], seeing reddit snoo icon instead])
1. **mod-post** (green icon [*not* OK], seeing grey speech icon instead])
1. **nsfw-post** (pink eyeball icon [OK])

Any insight into what I am doing wrong is greatly appreciated! I'm assuming that I haven't found the right sprite-usage FAQ or something.  The subreddit I am testing in is:

http://www.reddit.com/r/opentrackerproject/

Its locked, but there are some test posts visible. </TEXT>

SlingTV is a streaming video service.  If you have an internet connection and a compatible device - you can access SlingTV.

Yes, SlingTV uses your cellular data - just like every other internet video playback service. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> With Filebot, use the "-get-subtitles" switch with the "-lang" switch. Also use "-type srt" if you are using SubRip subtitles. Filebot will use the medianame you search against, and append ".lang.srt" to the end of the subtitle file it downloads.  Here are the basics for the command-line:

    filebot.exe -get-subtitles "medianame" --lang eng --output srt </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So weird, as I am seeing the opposite on other clients (instead of seeing the 3-letter sub language, its only seeing a 2-letter sub language).  I can't imagine wtf is going on, but its hella annoying.

AFAIK, the SubRip format (.srt) uses 3-letter language codes.  Its unofficial, but a generally observed practice.  When I download subs (with Filebot for example), the subs are named with a 3-letter language code. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've hiked similar trails where you are essentially skirting along a narrow footpath with a drop-off.  There is no way I would do that on something that could possibly tip over.  And hell - when its really windy, I would make yourself lower or even crawl until I was beyond that danger.

People who do otherwise have no regard for their personal safety and obligations in life, and they do it for bragging rights.  Fucking clown shoes. </TEXT>

I cant help but think that most people in this sub that are hardcore eva fans, are adults like myself, who were exposed to eva when we were teens.  I enjoy rewatching the series every now and then, and it seems like I learn or notice something new every damn time.

Regardless of the various collectables and collections posted here - the things that sketch me out are the posable dolls of the characters. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> regarding H.264 video, this is quite easy to verify.  use MediaInfo to determine what which H.264 profile/level was used, and compare that to client playback specs.

In all cases I have encountered, its a matter of the media having been authored at too high a level (codec settings that are too high-quality for the client to playback smoothly).
