	<TEXT> Shameful display.  This article ignores key facts in order to push a preselected narrative.

1) Pao was not subjected to any particular vitriol on being declared interim CEO, nor until after she began implementing questionable and unpopular policies --- such as banning fat-shaming forums while leaving far more foul content entirely alone.  Even geek-famous fat people (Such as Boogie, a popular Youtube commentator) spoke up against this ham-handedness (and you will be hard-pressed to find anyone on the Internet nicer than Boogie).

2) Pao clearly did not care about the racist/sexist slander, and good on her for that.  No matter how justified one might think they were, that is not how mature and intelligent people handle outrage.  Then again, when tens of thousands gather to burn the President in effigy while screaming approval, mocking his intellect, gender and skin color, we call that a public protest and ask the Administration what they did wrong.  (Note: I'm referencing anti-war protests against Bush)

3) The petition is what gained traction in the press, and it is clearly what Pao is resigning over, BECAUSE it got traction in the press and brought attention to her actions.

Your article is smearing over that with faux outrage --- and I notice that your co-author on the piece also references two of his own previous NYT articles about Pao's legal issues as another way to deflect all of this criticism.

The NYT should not be soapboxing for corporate officers they happen to like.  It's as shameful as when one of your Pulitzer-winners recently tied "Bronies" to accused mass-murderer Dylann Roof merely on basis of a photoshopped t-shirt she had no time (or interest) in verifying before publishing reference to.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Look, I know exactly what you're doing.

You're trying to conclude that Pao was the victim of sexism because people used language like "cunt" or some other insult; your reasoning being that the slur has some reference to "gender" attached to it, therefore, she is being insulted based on her gender.

This doesn't follow nor does it examine the motivations for why someone would begin to insult her.  Do you really, really think people insulted Pao merely for being a woman?  Then you really do need to explain why people stuck up for Victoria.  Are you going to invent something about how people only defended Victoria to give themselves the appearance of caring about a woman?  That's about as uncharitable as you can be, but at this point, going through your history, I don't think you're here to engage with facts or truly analyze why people felt the way they do but to try to go quote farming for your next big "thinkpiece."  The reaction to Victoria being fired is direct contradiction to the story that redditors, etc, are just trying to drive women off the website, or wherever--and all you just did was handwave it away.  Doesn't fit the story?  Then don't include it.  Journalism at its finest.  Why not claim Victoria was let go out of some gender narrative?  It's just as baseless as the other shit you're trying to claim, but that won't stop you.

I'd suggest you don't understand the sarcastic, caustic, and sardonic nature of internet culture where people will say all sorts of offensive things (even racist or, yes, sexist) despite the motivation being different, but I honestly don't think you're that dim and you're doing this out of an ideological basis to give your personal pet issues more advertisement and try to claim they're really the issue you say they are, blah blah blah.  So let's take this about another character that was unpopular; nobody likes or liked George W. Bush, and everyone made comments about how he looked like a chimp; do you really think people bashed him solely because he looks like a chimp?  No, he was bashed because of his policies and other reasons.  People insulted Michael Moore's weight not because he was fat, but because they were motivated by contrary politics or perceptions of his honesty. This hive of bees doesn't care what gender is sticking its hand in the hive; it'll sting flesh regardless of who it's attached to.

You're going to write up a piece referencing sexism and racism on the internet, removed entirely from the context of the conversation, claim "Chairman Pao" references are motivated solely by racist intent and that her being called a "bitch" is because she's a woman above all else.  You're going to slant this, mislead, and then pat yourself on the back for this bit of "activism."

Nobody gives a flying fuck what Pao's gender is.  Are you this big of an idiot where you think there's some widepread male supremacy movement on the internet?  Go on, prove it, then.  And don't use your feelings or humanities crap, use actual social science.  People here are more concerned with reddit generally keeping a hands-off approach to its communities and not favoring any political perspective (even refusing to censor the most vile ones) than the personal identities and the lives of the admins.

So let's drop all the pretenses.  You know you're being dishonest and you're full of shit, trying to drum up attention to pet causes.  Obviously, we know it too.  So what is your goal here?  It's to try to influence the uninformed, propaganda style, to try to get support for your politics  And you're a piece of shit for trying to play that kind of game.

And I'm not going to be polite to you about this either.  Because this entire show of you being "polite" or professional while you farm for vitriol for your next write-up is just to give yourself an air of professionality and respectability you don't deserve, and to give the impression you're trying to give people a fair shake when your conclusions were predestined.  When you're surrounded by your colleagues, drunk late and night in a bar chatting about work, I'm sure the discussion is much, much different.

	<TEXT> Without meaning to sound condescending, I really think you should endeavour to excavate a little deeper into the mineshaft of cinema. Dumb action-flicks and superhero films are the common metals near the top of the mineshaft. They're completely accessible: everybody 'gets' them. You don't have to do much work to get the shallow sort of no-frills 'entertainment' they provide.

However, something which most teenagers are not yet aware of, is that down there in the mineshaft is a wealth of precious gems so beautiful and so thought-provoking that if you experienced them, you would never want to go back to the rather common and mundane stuff on the surface. Down there are films that can make you cry and leave you in a state of heightened emotion for days. Down there are films that can change your perspective of how you view your own life, or how you view other people. Down there are films that will worm their way into your brain and start to become a part of your identity.

But you can't just leap down the mineshaft. If your diet consists of Transformers, Harry Potters and Avengers, you will break your neck if you try to dive straight for the Blade Runners and the American Beautys. Challenge yourself to dig downwards. Watch films from as many different genres, time-periods and cultures as you can. Try to inch away from your comfort zone. 

Again: please don't think me as being condescending. This isn't an intelligence thing. People who appreciate the "depressing philosophical bullshit" of films like Birdman aren't more intelligent than you. They've just put more time into exploring cinema and adventuring into their own personal mineshaft. I know it seems comfortable at the top, but I can promise you that digging is very, *very* worth your time. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Shostakovich, String Quartet No. 3, Op. 73

Cailin Quartet:

Clara Bk, violin

Sophia Bk, violin

Stine Hasbirk, viola

Therese strand, cello.

1.Allegretto

2.Moderato con moto

3.Allegro non troppo

4.Adagio 

5.Moderato.

**Dmitri Shostakovich, 1906-1975**

**String Quartet No. 3, F major, Op. 73, 1946**

Just after World War II, Shostakovich, then forty, turned once again from his public orchestral music to his private chamber music, composing his String Quartet No. 3 in F major, Op. 73. While he had already written nine symphonies, Shostakovich was just settling into his emerging series of string quartets that would eventually comprise fifteen quartets written throughout his mature life, including some of his very last compositions. Many feel that the String Quartet No. 3 is among is his best quartets; it was a favorite of the composer himself.

It shows Shostakovich in his full powers as a chamber music composer, skillfully deploying the string quartet to express his utterly distinctive musical personality. From a technical standpoint, the quartet, like many of his later quartets, features an astonishing range of textures, sonic effects and brilliant part writing in the service of music with startling emotional and psychological impact. Successful as abstract musical expression on the one hand, it is nearly impossible to miss the topical and programmatic nature of the quartet, another aspect common to most of Shostakovich's chamber music.

The unspeakable hardships of life in the Soviet Union up through the end of WWII took their toll on Shostakovich: nervous, bitter and depressed, he found his most profound outlet in the safe privacy and intimate expressive capability of chamber music. String Quartet No. 3 is a particularly powerful example. </TEXT>

Of all the nearly forgotten music by Mendelssohn, the most nearly completely forgotten is his music for chorus. Only his songs come close to being as almost entirely ignored, but because a few of them have earned a place in the recital hall, even they have a more prominent place in the repertoire. This 10-disc Brilliant set of Mendelssohn's complete choral works featuring the Chamber Choir of Europe under Nicol Matt addresses this problem even though it may not solve it. The performances are uniformly excellent. The Choir has a smooth tone and superb diction and Matt elicits from them polished balanced and ardent interpretations. Despite the dearth of comparisons, these performances with their clean textures, light tempos, and devout tone are surely as close to definitive as is possible to imagine. For some listeners, of course, this may not be enough to redeem Mendelssohn's heartfelt yet stolid music from obscurity. For others with more open minds, however, this set may serve to introduce a body of sacred works that certainly exceeds any other similar body of works from the same period in terms of skill and sincerity. Though a bit recessed, Brilliant's digital sound is cool and clear.

Mainly the central romance between Kenny Wormald and Julianne Hough is less authentic than the real one between Miles Teller and Kenny Wormald.

If you're not familiar with the remake of Footloose it came out to the acclaim of no one and was promptly forgotten amongst the shit heap shores of remake island with Total Recall and Straw Dogs. It's the same story except Craig Brewer, the director of Black Snake Moan and that shit where Terrence Howard pretends to play a big boy not on the verge of tears and raps and shit, does something I really don't remember in the original film.

I started getting my suspicions when the introductory scenes between Ren Mackormick (Wormald) and Willard Hewitt (Miles Teller) had this strange air of sexual tension. For instance, Willard and Ren sit down for school lunch and Ren begins to tell Willard of his worldly travels. It's here where all my experience reading erotic novels from Anne Rice and Henry Miller have paid off because Willard starts asking Ren to finish the story of the night Ren went out with two Russian women and had them as his sexual conquests.

Why does Willard want to know this? Especially after they just met. When Willard finds out Ren's story is false he's disappointed like he had a bunch of armed thugs rob his spank bank of Ren Mackormick related erotic fantasies. 

It only gets weirder from here because every interaction with Julianne Hough is dry and unromantic. He's basically trying to save this psycho girl from trying to kill herself, she attempts to play chicken with a train (like she was gonna win...sorry you don't have roundhouse kicks, Hough) and she's under the impression this means Ren loves her when Ren's true love really lies with Willard. 

As the movie goes on Ren learns that Willard can't dance and that in order to challenge the city counsel on the ordinance to make dancing illegal they must have a tete a tete at a car wash where Willard and Ren talk about wet t-shirt contests. But then promptly Ren douses Willard with the car wash hose. When this happens Willard runs around to Ren and they begin wrestling. Perhaps if Craig Brewer had trained his camera a little longer on this scene Ren would have tripped on the water line and Willard would have fallen on top of him. They would have realized that they are in love and embrace each other in chaste french kisses as the music swells and they go off to city to live a bohemian life style. Ren would become a steel worker and Willard a starving artist painting nudes of Zebras and rats with large phallus's on their heads.  

But no. Brewer denies us this possibility for more cock teasing and more audience approved heterosexual mating with Julianne Hough, Now a note on Julianne Hough. Hough is amazing looking.  She really nails the part of playing a down home southern preachers daughter rebelling against her father but she also wears small shorts and this is distracting because it's like on some level Brewer knows he accidentally directed Brokeback Footloose, but ended up having to save face by adding this eye candy. 

Either way, we then have to sit through tedious montages of Willard learning to dance, and it's in the key scene where Willard dances with Ren's nieces in a line dance rendition of "Let's Hear it for the Boys" that really seals the deal because in between the already extremely homosexual undertones of that scene, Brewer adds inserts of Willard and Ren learning to dance in Ren's garage just as the sun falls down. Ren is teaching Willard to "fist-pump" and it looks as if they are holding each other in a masculine version of a ballroom waltz. But this repeats the formula of the car wash scene in which Brewer has the realization that he made Priscilla, Queen of the Footloose Dancefloor and cuts too soon out of shame. 

The movie marches onto the finish, shit resolves and that's how I learned the remake of Footloose is a great movie about two high school boys testing the limits of their sexuality. And if that didn't convince you, the bearback bang bros bus driving scene will.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I experienced something very similar to this, but probably worse in my opinion - not even a week ago.

On July 1st, I got off work and was doing some late night grocery shopping - not even that late, it was about 10:30pm - at the Kroger near my house, who also supply several of these handicap grocery carts for disabled customers which are usually located in the front of the store. I had noticed that this evening, there was none available, because a disabled woman was walking around on a cane asking for one. 

I thought it was strange and was like oh well, must be busy - it is the first of the month. Not very many cars in the parking lot, but I guess people are bulking up for the holiday. So I go on shopping.

Inside the store doing my thing, right off the bat I see 3 people on carts who were clearly not disabled. Of which, one guy was letting his kid, a 7 year old - drive it around, while he walked along side. And this was right in front of the store, in ear-shot of that lady who actually needed a one. They could hear her asking for it, still did nothing - kept on going.

It really pissed me off, but I thought well, maybe they're disabled and it's just not evident. I'll hold my tongue, just do my shopping - get out of here.

So I keep on going, I see a 4th cart - same thing. This time 2 young women, which got my attention when one got up and let the other sit/drive the cart. I just stopped and stared at them like... for real? You know there's a lady up front right now who actually needs one of these and you guys are just riding around on it for fun??? And they went off on me, same way this guy did - "YOU CANT TELL US WHAT TO DO" - I just threw my hands up, kept on walking.

I get to the checkout lane, waiting in the only line they have open - when sure enough that kid that was driving one - crashed into a display right next to me, knocking over a fuck-ton of shit. The parents response? Not no, "I'm sorry" or "oops" or anything even remotely fucking human - they just walked away. WALKED AWAY - cart and all. Leaving all that shit.

My Kroger also has a self-checkout lane, but because I had so much stuff I decided to wait in line. So during my long wait, those 2 women who screamed at me for telling them what to do - they checked out right as I was finishing bagging my groceries. I walk outside and they are plugging it in, one talking to the other about how they better hurry - they're going to miss their bus.

Seriously, that was the most frustrating grocery trip I've ever had. I've never felt like a racist before until that moment - because it dawned on me. Out of the 5+ offenders, they were all black. Loud, and ignorant, and black. And the lady who didn't have a cart who actually needed one? White. I seriously wanted to punch those people, especially the cunt black family that crashed the cart into a display, and the poor white Kroger employee just walked over and started picking it up - like it happens all the time. 

I'm never shopping again on the 1st of the month - seriously. It made my blood boil, the whole thing.

	<TEXT> I can't wait for the day when things stop being about black white and yellow and brown and all that stuff and we can just call assholes, assholes. This black guy pisses me off. I'm a black guy and if I call this idiot out, I'm considered someone that's sucking up to white people, by other white people here on reddit. It's already happened multiple times. When you're a black guy and you call out the retarded behavior of other black people instead of prtending it's reasonable behavior, you're called a coon and a sellout by the same black people do this stupid shit.

And all you white middle class liberals need to snap out of this delusion that it's only a hand full of black people like this guy in this video. Take it from someone who knows. a huge percentage of black people have this guy's fucked up mentality. 75% of black mothers are single (the reason why would make this post even longer) and these guys (including myself) are raised by these women alone so they have to over compensate by acting more aggressive and masculine.I got lucky because my family comes from the country and not the inner city. My mother got her masters degree and became a college professor. I went to private school for the first few years of my life and then got an almost culture shock when I went to public school in the 2nd grade (we were never rich or even middle class, but lower middle class. my mom had to retire early after getting really sick, though she's doing well now). Kids in private school were mostly polite. The "bad kids" were just class clowns at worst. But then in private school, all the kids were cursing and using the N-word left and right. There were fights every other day, and I'm pretty sure in like 3 or 4 instances from 2nd to 5th grade there was always that one student who had to sit by himself near the teacher's desk and he clearly needed to be in a special needs class.

My point is that there are a ton of shitty black people out there and there are a good bit of great black people. The same goes with asian, white, latino, etc etc. When a black asshole is being an asshole, everyone should be able to call him or her out on it without being a white racist or a black sellout. Yes, racism exists, but if we're going to move forward we need equality on all fronts. I actually like it if a white person can disagree with me and argue about something and call me out on something if I'm doing something stupid in person, because they're speaking to me in the same way they'd speak to a white person that did the same thing. But when they decide to talk down to me like I didn't know any better because I'm "just a dumb child like black person" and just pretend like I've done something valuable it's irritating. We'd should not be treated like retarded children who don't know any better. That's not going to fix "racism"

	<DATE> 2015-07-07 09:12:59 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Perhaps more than any other filmmaker in recent years, Christopher Nolan has a following. These so called "Nolanites" love to tout the brilliance of his films, and one of the most popular statements has been to call Nolan a modern Kubrick. Despite being a big fan of Nolan i've never quite understood this statement, especially considering Nolan's visual style does not have much in common with Kubrick's. But I think it goes beyond that, and after seeing Interstellar it finally clicked for me what the biggest difference is: Nolan's films lack subtext. It really is that simple. For whatever reason, Nolan wants his characters to say exactly what they are thinking at any given time. If a character is mad at another character, they will state it plainly. The same goes for every single emotion. There is no misdirection, lying, innuendo, or nuance. It's as if Nolan wants to make sure we understand what the character is feeling and doesn't trust us to infer it by context. This doesn't just relate to character feelings, but also to plot and theme. Look at the ending of Interstellar. When he gets to the weird Library near the end, we get it. We're literally seeing it happen. We don't necessarily understand how it's happening, but we do understand what is happening. Despite this, Nolan decided to have McConaughey and Chastain both state out loud to themselves what is going on, multiple times. Why? We already see what's happening, why exactly do we need the characters to awkwardly reinforce it by talking to themselves? This is especially interesting when you compare this scene to the ending of 2001, a film that Nolanites have been trying to compare to Interstellar since the film was first announced. In that famous ending to 2001, Kubrick doesn't explain anything. He just presents it, and leaves the meaning up to your own interpretation. This forces you to think about the film and what was happening, and is key to why the film is so iconic all these years later. This is night and day different from Nolan's approach to a similarly bizarre event. Nolan chooses to explain it numerous times, just incase we were sleeping I guess, and the ultimate result of this is that we get it. There's nothing to solve, and we leave the theater not questioning "oh what did that mean?" but instead saying "huh, that was interesting" and then proceeding to realize all the plot holes in the film. I admit I was in the crowd of people that was really hoping Nolan would finally "grow up" and make a picture that treats the audience with respect, but after seeing Interstellar i've realized he's just not that kind of filmmaker. Which leads to me the "why that's ok" part. You know what? I really enjoyed Interstellar. It was a blast and one of the most enjoyable theater experiences i've had this year. Despite being 2h49m, which is actually longer than 2001, I never felt bored for a single moment. This is the great skill of Nolan...he makes the most enjoyable blockbusters out there. And I accept that. I no longer wish for him to "grow up", because I actually really enjoy seeing his films. Sure, I don't think about them much afterwards and I will never put them on the same level of the great filmmakers, but for pure entertainment nobody does it better right now than Christopher Nolan, and for that I will always be a fan. </TEXT>
