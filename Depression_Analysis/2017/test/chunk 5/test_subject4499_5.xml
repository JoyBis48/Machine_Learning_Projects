	<TEXT> My oldest son is almost 22 months, and for the past little while I cannot leave his presence (use the washroom, make/take a phone call, run errands etc etc.) without him throwing an absolute nightmarish tantrum. Up until now I've more or less shrugged it off, but I've got to thinking that *maybe* it's some form of separation anxiety. Now I'm wondering if this is normal and maybe just a phase kids go through. Just wondering if any of you have advice. Thanks! </TEXT>
