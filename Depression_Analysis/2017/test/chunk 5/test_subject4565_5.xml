	<TEXT> Here's one, although this article deals mainly with the danger associated with taking too much in one dose.

It does say this, however:

Tramadol is an increasingly commonly prescribed painkiller  prescriptions have almost doubled in the past seven years, from 5.9million in 2006 to 11.1million in September 2012.

Its popularity has soared partly because its cheap  now available as a non-branded generic drug, it costs the NHS 1.99 for 100 tablets.

Fears about other painkillers have also made tramadol an attractive option.

Lizz's death is by no means an isolated case and highlights the dangers associated with a drug (Tramadol) too often regarded as the 'safer' option

The non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs) are linked to side-effects such as indigestion, stomach ulcers, a perforated gut.

One of these drugs, Vioxx, was withdrawn in 2005 because of a link to heart attack and stroke.

Meanwhile, another painkiller, co-proxamol, was withdrawn after concerns about it being used in suicides.

Tramadol  which also comes under brand names including Zydol and Zamadol  is a synthetic opioid drug, similar to natural opioids derived from poppy seeds, such as morphine.

Its prescribed to prevent or treat moderate to severe pain after surgery, toothache or long-term pain conditions including back pain, fibromyalgia and osteoarthritis.

Tramadol is regarded by many doctors as a weaker opioid. But in fact it has the same risks of overdose as with morphine. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The social is the hardest piece of necessary information to obtain these days. Everything else tends to be pretty easily accessible online.

When I stopped selling on ebay, i wasn't too disappointed as fees were increasing and final selling prices were waning. I started selling locally on Craigslist with better results, and have also recently considered opening an Etsy store because much of the stuff I deal with is vintage/antique. 

The main reason I stopped selling on eBay however was Paypal.  </TEXT>

I am probably going to go back and buy it tomorrow, because he'll probably give it to me for around $10. Either way, I will certainly snap a photo(s) of it and post some links. It's quite an interesting piece. 

The style of the crown itself was more identical to the first one you linked to.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey, thanks for that great info. In the symbol I saw, the crown was much smaller in proportion to the triangle and positioned entirely inside the triangle, at the center. That could simply be because it is older than the medal you linked to. I would say you are most likely correct and that my hat is the hat of a royal arch mason from the early 1900's. Thanks again.

	<TITLE> I am looking for help identifying a symbol found on a post civil war - WW1 era military style hat. It is a golden triangle with a crown in the middle. Could possibly also be masonic. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-06-22 02:20:00 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> As simple as this symbol seems, I can't seem to locate another example anywhere. It is that of a simple thin golden triangle with a crown in the center. The crown looks similar to that which the British use in their military insignias from WW1. 

Unfortunately I did not snap a picture of the exact logo. I would however be able to update tomorrow with one if necessary. The symbol is located front and center of the hat above the brim. The hat is in very rough condition, as it is very old. The hat manufacturer is called The M. C. Lilley Co. and they were established a few years after the civil war and are based out of Ohio USA. They are known for manufacturing military gear/uniforms as well as Masonic gear/uniforms. I could not locate the symbol, or anything similar, while using various keywords related to both subjects. 

Oddly, there are also large feathers sort of woven into the top of the hat. Not sure if that is original or was done after the fact.

Any help identifying this triangle/crown symbol would be greatly appreciated! </TEXT>
