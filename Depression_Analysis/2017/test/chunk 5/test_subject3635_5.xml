	<TEXT> Bro, dropping 30 places in the list of the most corrupt countries is kinda of a small achievement. I don't think you should start with that sentence if you are trying to highlight the rampant growing corruption in India </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Probably not in the coming decade. Maybe after that. 

But in a way it is good as we will be able to see how this plays out in countries like U.S and learn from their mistakes/exleriences after 10 years.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Although I am a BJP supporter and believe that Kejriwal will eventually end up like a Lalu or Mulayam (both had a lot of expectations from people like Kejri has since both were disciples of J.P but...after a decade or so they did not turn out to be what people expected) I do think that this hike in the education expenditure is good. If it is executed properly then it could be one of the best things that ever happened to Delhi.

Moreover the play grounds of Government  schools will be available to colony kids for playing after school hours so that'll be cool too. It's a small move, but was really needed. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Damned if you do, damned if you don't. At least the people who know a thing or two about diplomacy will understand the reason behind such generosity. It's a long term investment. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Any experiences with star gazing in Delhi? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> I got to know about the amature astronomers association in Delhi and decided to join it in a week or so. They basically gather at a place and do some star gazing with their telescopes.

Being a complete noob I have no idea how good the visibility is in Delhi considering the air quality. 

Any suggestions or comments?  </TEXT>
