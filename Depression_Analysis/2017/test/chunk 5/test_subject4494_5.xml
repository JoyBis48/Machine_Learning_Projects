	<TEXT>  My point is not whether we want to do it or rather it is good, that is a whole other discussion. My point is that if the above-mentioned payment processors, with their infrastructure backing them, collude to do it, they can force it regardless of what the miners want.

If they were to completely fork bitcoin in a non-backward compatible way, and 50% of the miners wanted to stop it, they could just collude to attack the fork, with a standard 51% attack.

You can't do this without the miners. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's actually the worst way to fork. If we don't have 50%, we don't want to switch. We also don't want to force miners to mine larger blocks. You could get around that by specifying some non-backwards compatible protocol change, but I don't see a strong reason for that (I haven't thought a lot about it, though.)

(And seriously, a hard fork isn't enough, you also want to break compatibility with smaller blocks?) </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  If the exchanges agree among themselves, though, on going one fork and not the other, the mining pools can mine all they want, but whatever they mined/voided will be worthless.

That's only if the forks aren't compatible. As long as the 20MB nodes still accept 1MB blocks , and more than 50% of miners stay on the 1MB fork, there *is* no other fork.

The 1MB fork would win on both forks.

The claim "whatever they mined/voided will be worthless" is just wrong, unless the other fork is longer, which only happens if 50% of miners switch. </TEXT>

If less than 50% of miners switch, there's no "longer" chain to switch to. The one with only 1MB or smaller blocks will always be longer. It will not become worthless.

	<TEXT>  Do you get paid to write such things? How does one talk about Snowden without talking about the NSA?

You're using my criticism of Snowden to imply that I approve of the NSA. That's wrong, and if you can't see why, we shouldn't talk about the NSA altogether.

You are using the same tactics as government shills by focusing on specifics part of the programs while avoiding talking about the parts that affect Americans.

I'm sure government shills also use English, that doesn't mean I'm one because I use English. Logical fallacy, again.

And of course it's against others countries laws for the US to spy on every country, the UN called the US out on that matter. To argue otherwise is intellectually dishonest.

Talk about intellectual dishonesty; the example you linked isn't about spying on other countries' citizens, it's about spying on protected international missions! That's illegal under international law (and therefore under US law as well, due to [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_Clause).)

Is that really a serious question?

Yes. You'd do well to take every point I make here seriously.

Do you really believe that any country would willingly allow foreign nationals to spy on them?

What a country allows and what is legal are two different things.

 In France for example they have "Loi Macron" that forbids such thing

As far as I can see this Loi Macron is something passed recently, within the last few months, for example http://www.thelocal.fr/20150410/france-gifted-but-lazy-loafing-pierre-gattaz and http://www.afrizap.com/en/france/. So it seems irrelevant, unless I'm missing something.

 there are other laws but I don't know them on top of my head and frankly this is a silly exercise .

I don't think it is. I think the question of whether the activities are illegal in other countries isn't that relevant to whether Snowden did the right thing by exposing them, but I also think some of them were legal, and if you know otherwise I'd like to hear your sources. 

For one source that says it is largely legal, see https://theconversation.com/i-spy-you-spy-we-all-spy-but-is-it-legal-20540.

I see your point, but when one starts with the insult before the argument, one looks silly, especially when the following argument is based on half-truths.

I don't think my argument was based on half truths.

Yet we learnt that Germany was aware, the chancellor appeared angry so its population would not get even more upset. One should not listen to what officials say, but what they actually do, and we know that the German spy agency helped the NSA.

That doesn't claim that the Germans knew the US was spying on *them*. They helped the US spy on other targets.

I highly doubt the Merkel knew that the US was tapping her cell phone, and your source does not claim that.

It's not a maybe, it's a clear yes, and the same is true of Americans.

For Americans, I have to decide if the good that was done by revealing the abuses outweighs the problematic parts of what he leaked. This is a very real tradeoff that is not solved by pointing to the parts that he leaked that *were* illegal programs. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  I mean the collective value.

I still don't get what your argument is against my use of market cap. Explain what you mean by collective value, and why that has anything to do with my statement.

You may be arguing definitions. I'm arguing against what you are implying and against your method of argument in general. You have not actually elaborated on why your application of market capitalization to bitcoin is of any substance.

Someone above said something along the lines of "if bitcoin ever achieves any significant value, it will be easily attacked". The context was clearly saying that it's not being attacked right now because it's not worth enough.

So I responded by asking how it could be viewed as having no value now to attack, if the market cap is over 1 billion. Obviously an attack wouldn't pull out the whole market cap, but a successful exploit against bitcoin would probably be worth at least 1% of the market cap, which is still significant. There's also the point that as the price rises, the amount spent on mining also rises, which raises the cost for mining attacks.

I don't think that argument could be reasonably mistaken for the argument "bitcoin has a high market cap, therefore bitcoin=good", which I agree is ridiculous.

What the hell do you think a market cap of a volatile asset that crashes like a rocket pointing the wrong way if anyone actually tries to move some volume and has nothing to back it means, other than "this number is impressive".

It means that some portion of it is up for the taking should anyone have a real attack on bitcoin. Obviously you couldn't get the entire market cap, but some portion can be gotten. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I know what each word means separately, I don't get what you meant above by using both together.

Nope, that's the appeal to authority. Just because BoA does it doesn't mean it's right (unless foreclosing on the wrong house is right). They probably aren't misusing it as badly as you are in this case but the point stands.

You seem to misunderstand appeal to authority, and why it's a logical fallacy. We're not arguing over a factual matter, but a definitional matter. When arguing definitions, how it's used by people is a relevant form of evidence. You have yet to say what you'd consider evidence, or give any sources at all for your claim.

See http://skepdic.com/authorty.html, which lists the conditions that an appeal to authority is a fallacy.

I know you were trying to impress people. Stop pretending like you didn't throw "bitcoin" and "over a billion dollars" to make it seem important.

Well, if you can read my mind, why don't you comment on the brilliant rebuttal I'm thinking of right now?

Or more seriously, you *can't* read my mind, and apparently can't correctly infer people's intentions from their writing. The mention above was to disprove a claim. I have different things I mention when I want to impress people, but this sub is not where I try impressing people. </TEXT>

They already raised it and the judge pointed out the problem with the request. I doubt that could go through on as a basis for appeal.

How about Ross' experts being blocked from testimony and that the journal and screenshots could have been total fabrication?

They'd have to show why the judge was wrong in denying the testimony (for being filed too late.)

You can't just repeat old arguments in an appeal, you need new ones.

For the "faked screenshots", they'd need to argue against the agents that testified for its credibility, which is different from the corrupt agents.

Again, doubt an appeal has much basis unless there are new arguments.
Finally, do the indicted federal agents' crimes play a part in this appeal?

As nothing connected to them was brought up in the trial, again, unlikely. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  PRISM collects all internet communications from US citizens, this is a clear breach of the The Fourth Amendment of the US constitution and the Bill of Rights which guarantees privacy and prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures.
 Your comparison of a US citizen calling Google and demanding their data of other countries makes no sense, you're just trying to whitewash what the NSA did.

I did no whitewashing. We're talking about Snowden now, not the NSA. It's a logical fallacy to say that because I think Snowden did some wrong things, that I think the NSA is right in what *they* did. I don't.

Now, whether it's a "clear breach" is debatable, legal experts have said otherwise, but that's not the point here. I'm talking about PRISM spying on other countries' citizens. You said it would be against other countries' laws, which I denied. So I asked you to list which law it would break, and you didn't answer.

An ad hominem is when you attack someone's character rather than their argument, there is no place for such place for such puerile attack if one wants to be taken seriously.

You've made some personal attacks on me yourself, but no matter.

The ad hominem fallacy is when you say "that guy is stupid, therefore he is wrong". When you say "that guy is wrong, for reasons X, Y, and Z, therefore he is stupid", that's not ad hominem.

See http://laurencetennant.com/bonds/adhominem.html

So your issue with Snowden is the fact that he let foreign states know about the capabilities of the US? But we know that these states (like Germany, France, Britain, etc..) knew about the program, they were part of it. So it was no surprise to these governments, in effect Snowden didn't disclose anything other foreign agencies didn't already, what he did was to let citizens know about the abuse of power by our Governments, and for that he should be thanked.

First of all, not all states knew about US spying on them. Germany in particular got very upset with the US for spying on them; if you're conspiracy minded you could dismiss that as fake anger, but I doubt it.

what he did was to let citizens know about the abuse of power by our Governments, and for that he should be thanked.

If you're a non-us citizen, then maybe. And I do think leaking any of the illegal programs (under US law/constitution) is fine, and I'll thank him for that. The problem is those documents he leaked, that did not describe anything illegal. I don't see how the fact that other countries may have known about them makes it any better.

Again, if someone were to publically reveal a weapon that your government had been developing against other countries, would you thank them? If no, then Snowden deserves no praise from Americans for the programs involving spying on other countries that he revealed. </TEXT>

First of all, let's [link to the actual post](http://sourceforge.net/p/bitcoin/mailman/message/34157036/)

That says it's more than they can handle now, they want to to increase smoothly. Right now there's no need for such big blocks, but developers are worried about the future, and supporting more.

Anyway, I was talking here about what would happen if 20MB blocks were common, that's not going to happen for a while.

Greg Maxwell has said that most of the ghash hashrate drop off after the 51% scare was CEX moving their hashrate to other pools to hide it. This apparently happened after a meeting with all the big mining players, and is likely being done by other large operations specifically to make it appear that everything is fine.

This is a larger concern. I'm not sure if he said "most", though, what I recall is that "some" was hidden. </TEXT>

Learn what a market cap is before coming here and making a fool of yourself.

Please elaborate. I find it fascinating that [Bank of America](http://www.cnbc.com/id/101250070) is hiring people with no knowledge of finance as analysts.

I may be stupid, but I could probably become their "head of global rates and currencies research", because apparently that doesn't require knowing what market cap means. </TEXT>

What crime would a US citizen be committing by calling up google and demanding their data on other countries, as in PRISM? What country says that is illegal for someone to do?

What crime is being committed by passive collection of data that goes through internet cables?

This opinion piece is quite bias, the author starts his essay with a ad hominem which shows his lack of argumentation

Ad hominem is when you don't include arguments, they did include them. I in fact quoted one.

I would consider them a defector, but we all know that the spying on all Americans is illegal and go against the Constitution, that the government was able to extend the law to fit their needs is not surprising, but it doesn't make its actions any more legal, at least constitutionally.

Again, my problem is with his exposure of spying on other countries, which is certainly legal under US law, if not those countries laws.

I'm amazed that people like you defend the spying on Americans.

Don't be, because I didn't defend that. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Lol please. Calling bitcoin a currency while saying it has a 3 billion dollar market cap is laughable at best.

I didn't call it a currency. You were the one who said "any popularity or value", which it clearly does possess. There's enough incentive to attack it.

In fact your claims are nothing more than bullshit which can easily be debunked by comparing bitcoins value with number of nodes. As bitcoin gained value mining centralized, and the number of nodes decreased. This isn't "something I've said a couple of times". This is exactly what happened from 2013 to 2015.

There are other factors, in particular the ability to use bitcoin without running a node, pools coming into existence (and solo mining not being practical), ASICs coming out which made mining something you needed a new device for. All of those are one-time events, that wouldn't effect what would happen if the price rose even higher. If you'd like to do a more careful analysis that controls for those factors somehow, I'd love to see it. But as it is, what you're saying only shows correlation where we have several other confounders that may be the cause.

Yes yes, that will be fixed in the future. Like every other gaping bitcoin problem.

This is code already in github, which will be released after testing. See https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/f9ec3f0fadb11ee9889af977e16915f5d6e01944 </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Currently bitcoin is partially decentralized. Bitcoin is such an obscure libertarian play toy that it's decentralized enough to remain secure. If it ever gained any popularity or value, the current decentralization would not be enough to stop it from being attacked.

How can you call something with a market cap of over 1 billion as not gaining value?

If there was enough motivation all you would have to do is convince 3 people in the world and you have control of the majority of the hashing power.

I've said this as well a couple of times. I do think that if bitcoin went significantly up in value, there would be substantially more nodes, and mining would decentralize more.

Also, those 3 people (and in reality, it's 3 companies, which hopefully have multiple people that would need to be compromised) would gain a lot quickly, but would then lose a lot of mining power as miners switched to a different pool. I also think that if the price goes up, miners will have more incentive to switch to smaller pools, because of the very same incentive for attackers.

Do the math, 20mb blocks = 1 TB of dice game spam added to the bloat chain every year. How many people are going to purchase multiple TBs of disk space and give up all of their bandwidth to run a node?

There have been proposals. Note that pruning will allow for the vast majority of the blockchain to be discarded. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Of course not, but it's illegal under US laws for other countries to spy on the US and vice versa, hence spying is illegal.

It's more complicated than that. Hacking would be illegal, but simply grabbing data from cables, or intercepting it when it comes into the US might not be.

What programs are you referring to?

http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/edward-snowden-is-no-hero

These were legally authorized programs; in the case of Verizon Businesss phone records, Snowden certainly knew this, because he leaked the very court order that approved the continuation of the project. So he wasnt blowing the whistle on anything illegal; he was exposing something that failed to meet his own standards of propriety.

I had a typo above, sorry, you have a point.

My original comment still seems correct. Even if you believe the proportion of cops who would lie on some cases is higher than the proportion of family members who would lie, the proportion of cops who actually lie on a given case is lower than those who would lie on some case, but a family member has a much greater incentive to lie. After all, they're involved in the case.

	<TEXT> Did someone forget to tell vice that some were auctioned off at higher prices? I don't think I've seen the 700,000 figure before, but if it's accurate, and a significant amount were sold at $400, he could easily pay it all off.

Edit: They auctioned 130,000, I think: just an extra $150 on average from each is enough to cover that.

Further edit: they seized much less than 700,000, apparently only 174,000 or so. The question is whether Ross still has access to the rest.

	<TEXT>  of course spying is illegal but everyone does it

It's not illegal under US laws to spy on other countries. That's what the entire CIA is there for, basically.

It may be illegal under the other countries' laws, but someone revealing that one government is breaking the laws of a different government is generally called a traitor.

the biggest issue which Snowden uncovered was the scale of the spying, and the fact that the US spies on everyone including its own people which is a sign of authoritarian tendencies especially since it was done in secret and most likely against the US Consititution

If all he'd done was reveal illegal spying, I wouldn't have a problem. He revealed many programs that were completely legal, yet classified, and many programs that were against other countries, also legal under US law.

	<TEXT> Sort of, although that can be obscured as well, using Coinjoin. That basically means that multiple users all send in a merged transaction, so there's no way to tell which one owns which. There's code to do that at https://github.com/chris-belcher/joinmarket

But what I was describing is different. Basically, you send bitcoin to a site that has a large "pool" of bitcoin, and they send different ones back to another address you own. So only that site knows which coins were which. If they delete logs (like they claim to), then nobody can tell even after the fact. There's one at https://bitmixer.io/index.html </TEXT>
