	<TEXT> I heard white belts are just tossed in with the rest of the crowd and expected to survive at the same pace as everyone else in BJJ schools and that for the first few months - you don't really learn much. Is this true? If so... it really de-motivates me to try and learn BJJ. I learn better through a more organized, progressive curriculum. :/

Can anyone give me some insight? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So, basically Cardio while eating at maintenance will not make you leaner?

Before/After results. Is P90X to blame or is it possible they didn't follow through with the program with enough intensity? For some of these people, they actually GAINED weight, Loss Muscle Mass, AND gained bodyfat rather than lose any and make any lbm gains.

EDIT: Also, how can one avoid making no progress in their body while doing P90X? </TEXT>

If I may ask another stupid question - how long do you think I should give myself before I start working towards a bulk? I'm not sure how long this will take so I don't want to try to "waste" any time per se. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Question about Barbell Rows on Stronglifts 5x5 </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-06-01 16:03:10 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> In Stronglifts 5x5, the Barbell Row form is supposed to be set so your upper body is almost completely parallel with the floor with the bar rowed to your chest. I'm more used to the traditional barbell row with the bar rowed to your stomach with your chest up and back arched like so: http://filledfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/bent-over-barbell-row.png

Would it be okay to sub what I'm used to in place of Stronglifts' Barbell Row? The form just seems dangerous and difficult and I have a hard time rowing it to my chest which makes me rethink whether or not I'm doing it correctly. </TEXT>

And do you think I should keep below a certain number in order to try and keep it as lean as possible while trying to lean bulk? 

My goal is to be a lean 140-145 (basically my current weight but lean) but does that necessarily mean that I would have to bulk up to 165 in order to get the necessary muscle mass to cut down to? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm currently starting Stronglifts 5x5. I'm kind of frustrated at my body because I wouldn't say I'm "skinny fat" yet I'm skinny and I have no cuts, no definition whatsoever. My stomach is flat without abs and my arms aren't lean. Not quite sure what I should do because I don't want to bulk because I do Martial Arts and I don't want excess weight to hinder my speed and I don't want to get smaller in order to get cut. Hopefully that makes sense. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Does it have to do with the body mechanics of the kick itself or am I just at a low level of flexibility?

I can hold and launch a Roundhouse very well above my head height but I struggle to do so with the Side Kick.

EDIT: This is my goal: http://legalpronegotiator.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/High-Kick.jpg

Is it obtainable with constant flexibility training or are men naturally limited as opposed to their female counterparts when it comes to the Side Kick due to groin flexibility? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Do Kicking Paddle-Targets hurt the holder? </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> My friend, who doesn't do martial arts, has been helping me out with my training outside of practice. I just ask him to hold the paddle correctly as I kick it and he complains that it hurts and hyperextends his arm. He also tells me that whenever he holds it while I'm kicking - his veins start showing on his arms and it hurts him.

I can't tell if he's being serious, if I'm somehow inadvertently hitting the target incorrectly to where he's getting injured or if he's just a lousy helper. There's little kids and older adults that hold paddles** for each other and I have **never, ever** heard any of them complain that holding the paddle was hurting their arm. If the kick misfires and hits their actual hand, wrist, or arm then it's understandable. But this... I have never heard of until now.

Edit: Paddles not Padded </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh, I definitely agree with you. Or was this a reply to roninsascha? I just thought it was very ironic that he was criticizing the kicking frequency of a Taekwondo practitioner, let alone a Red Belt. </TEXT>

This is the same song interpreted in dance by an advanced Taekwondo group known as the K-Tigers since if you were interested in that :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Definitely not mocking them, but, in my honest opinion - that form at the beginning can be perfected by absolutely anyone with repetition. It definitely doesn't look like they had enough practice for this demonstration. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You didn't catch the White and Green Belts at the beginning of the video? All the kicks and forms are legitimate forms practiced in actual Taekwondo Dojangs but, for the most part - in this scenario, they were executed with bad technique. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have the same problem when I practice quick footwork on the mat. I get mat burn on my skin and sometimes it'll peel off and create blisters. When that happens I just wrap my blisters with gauze and tape so I can continue practicing while the blister can heal properly. It'll take awhile but it works for me and it'll work for you too.

As for prevention... I don't quite know the answer to that, tbh. Perhaps wearing in-door TKD shoes? </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Superboy is a hybrid clone created by Cadmus as well as Red Arrow (non-hybrid though). However Red Arrow seems to age physiologically while Superboy maintains in youthful apperance throughout the timeskip. It's hinted in the series that Superboy will never appear to age.

My question is, why can Red Arrow age yet Superboy can't despite both being Cadmus clones?  </TEXT>
