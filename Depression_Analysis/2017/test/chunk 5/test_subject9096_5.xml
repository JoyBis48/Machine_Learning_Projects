	<TEXT> Yep yep yep 10000x yep.

This is my biggest grammar pet peeve, because I feel like when people use 'I' when they should use 'me,' they are incorrectly patting themselves on the back for 'remembering the rule.'

Thank you good sir. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> "It is very likely that at least some degree of Ebola virus transmission currently occurs via infectious aerosols generated from the gastrointestinal tract, the respiratory tract, or medical procedures, although this has been difficult to definitively demonstrate or rule out, since those exposed to infectious aerosols also are most likely to be in close proximity to, and in direct contact with, an infected case,"

Yep so people will be fear mongering with this even though the scientists admitted it was impossible to control for.

Also

Thursday's study examines the idea that minuscule droplets of body fluid containing the virus could hang in the air and be inhaled by others, providing an unrecognized, if minor, pathway for the virus.

Not the same thing as an Ebola mutated to be airborne! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In my experience, I have observed that we get a lot of questions about what it is like to be an archaeologist. Which tells me that like most scientists, we are not so great at communicating what it is we do exactly with the general public.

As a general rule, archaeology is not sexy and I have never seen it portrayed accurately in a film for this reason. For something closer to accurate, think "Scrubs" except with shovels. Most archaeologists work project to project, usually on something related to infrastructure. These projects are conducted in advance of construction projects making use of federal funds. Very rarely does anyone go looking for something in particular (because of confirmation bias for one thing) because archaeology is EXPENSIVE when you do it right, which includes proper excavation and reporting techniques. There is no quick way to earn respect but shitty excavation practices and bad ethics is a hell of a way to lose it.

I'm fortunate enough to be salaried at a major American university, but that also means I no longer do much digging. My main focus is on public education. 

Best of luck with your project!

Also, we as a whole have zero fashion sense. Jeans, a button down and boots with most of the dirt knocked off is professional attire. I love it. </TEXT>
