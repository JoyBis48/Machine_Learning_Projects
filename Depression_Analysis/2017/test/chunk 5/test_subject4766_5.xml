	<TEXT> After civil war everyone is going to be asking why Iron Man isn't in Guardians of the Galaxy 2 or why Captain America isn't in Thor Ragnarok. I think marvel have created an in inescapable situation here with civil war where they have essentially killed their own solo films by making civil war basically avengers 2.5 and now all the fans will be wondering why certain characters wont be in other characters solo films. Is the age of the solo film done? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It seems like Loki is the only villain marvel have seem to have gotten right in the MCU. Bucky was also a pretty decent villain in TWS so marvel do seem to be learning and hopefully they'll knock it out of the park with Ultron. But it seems like with Thor and Iron Man they struggle a lot to make engaging and interesting villains. Why is that? Are their writers just having trouble grasping the source material or are they just surrounded by yes men who have no idea wtf they're doing? </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2015-03-06 04:11:54 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Think for a moment about ghosts. There are two proposed types: intelligent ghosts, and memories. Then, there are time travelers, something that seems unrelated at first thought.

Intelligent ghosts are the type you can interact with, and can interact with you. Some consider them to be dangerous, and others think them friendly.

Memories, however, are like a recording, repeating over and over. Imagine hearing a childs laugh every night at 3am. It is always the same, and always plays at the same time.

A time traveler dropping into the past for ten seconds would be able to interact for that brief moment. To an observer, the traveler would be seen appearing from nowhere, doing an action, and disappearing. Could this be considered a ghost as well? </TEXT>

Are there any MUST have Wii U exclusives? I guess I do want to play Mario Kart 8 and theres always the off chance nintendo brings out a pokemon colosseum like game for the Wii U sometime in the future. But beyond that I just dont know really.  </TEXT>
