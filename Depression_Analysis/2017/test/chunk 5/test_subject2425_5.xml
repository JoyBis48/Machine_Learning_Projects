	<TEXT> There is actually a way. It is very simple now because apple removed DRM from all of their songs about 2 years ago. All you have to do now is plug in your android to the computer, find where your itunes songs are stored on your computer (if they arent downloaded, download them first) and just click and drag to the music file of your android device. Album art and metadata comes with each file as well. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am learning this program by myself. But i have a question. [Here is the image im trying to reproduce in cad](http://i458.photobucket.com/albums/qq304/gwidas2000/steeringbush1kk9.jpg)

I made the 54 line, but how do i make the 36 line perfectly centered in between the 54 line?
I'm going to add the circles later after i get the lines made. Thanks.

Edit: you don't have to be in a university to use this, it also works for k-12. The only downside is that it expires in 3 years.
studica.com sells perpetual licenses (they never expire) for design suite and entertainment suite ($22,000 combined) for $500. </TEXT>
