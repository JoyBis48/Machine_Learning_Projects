	<TEXT> Some of it is semantics - the law differs from country to country. In the US if you had like some kind of hippie love nest (no offense intended) it would be easier to organize it under corporate law than civil union law.

	<TEXT> A partnership is a contract, usually between two people - it can be a few more - about how to operate a business (or, in this hypothetical case, a household.) More people involve forming a corporation, where stock is issued and there are more set rules, a board of directors, etc. </TEXT>

At the time the pyramids were built a canal ran to the site at Giza and the course of the Nile was a good deal closer to the site than in the middle ages, making stone transport a good deal easier. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There are engravings from the Renaissance that show the Great Pyramid about half-buried in a sand-drift. No, nothing in orthodox Christianity or Islam says that biblical figures built the pyramids, but in demotic folk religion this belief was common. You will hear it from taxi drivers in Egypt to this day. 

As for wanting to make a bigger structure, as I said, it was thought that the pyramids were the work of legendary figures so I doubt anyone thought it was possible. The Ptolemaic Dynasty in Egypt did brag that the Great Lighthouse was a successor to the pyramids. At 450 feet tall it was almost as tall as the Great Pyramid though of course its volume was far less. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I know that for some of the time period in question a good deal of the pyramids were obscured in sand drifts. 

However, it's wrong to suggest that people in previous times were not impressed by the pyramids. There were a good deal of legends about them, such as that they were built by biblical figures (usually Aaron, Moses or Mohammed), and that they could cure ailments. 

As the pyramids were seen as the creations of legendary figures, not ordinary men, their vast size was somewhat taken for granted. In that sense people in those times might have been less impressed than modern people as to the immensity of the achievement. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You will find a lot of private schools with endowments that don't really care what parents think - they will always have a line out the door for the snoot factor.

Then there's church-funded schools which also have powerful constituencies that are often indifferent to parent needs. 

In my experience public schools are often over-sensitive to parent demands because of a fear of lawsuits or a nasty story on the local news. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I know the feeling. Just beware that when you meditate sometimes small sensations can seem very amplified because your mind is quiet. I am not sure if chakras are "real" or not in a spiritual sense but I have been disappointed by these experiences in the long run - they seem to be leading to something great then it just fades. 

On the other hand some other mediators report quite impressive things that happen after the whole chakra/kundalini experience. I guess what I'm saying is don't get your hopes too high just yet but don't dismiss it either. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The "absolutist relativism" that is so often attributed to Postmodernists can be easily destroyed as a coherent concept by any halfway with-it college freshman, and already has been many times of course.

However, you'd be hard-pressed to find an actual "Postmodern" philosopher who actually held or holds such an extreme position, it's more of a straw-man position ascribed to these philosophers by their opponents. 

Part of the problem is there was never a coherent philosophical school called "Postmodernism," no Manifesto with bullet points nailing down specific beliefs, or anything like that, because after all, what could be more anti-Postmodern than a Manifesto? 

So therefore it's hard to point to any ideas that are specifically "Postmodern" in nature. It is/was more of a mood of epistemological skepticism and a style of argumentation than a defined set of positions.

Of course there is also Hess's own statement (under a pseudonym after landing) that he was a friend of the [Duke of Hamilton](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Douglas-Hamilton,_14th_Duke_of_Hamilton#World_War_II.2C_the_Hess_Affair.2C_and_after), and later on that the purpose of his flight was to negotiate a secret peace treaty. Hitler certainly believed that's what Hess was up to and ordered him shot on sight if he returned to Germany (although he may have changed his mind in the highly unlikely even that he returned with a treaty in hand!) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes, in fact he wanted an alliance with Britain against the US, where he thought the Aryan blood had been too corrupted by Jews, "Negroes," and other inferior types. And also he thought that two "Continental" powers would always be antagonistic, whereas a "Continental" and a "Maritime" power could work together. He saw both Germany and the US as continental but the British Empire as Maritime. All this and more bonkers geopolitics can be found in [Hitler's second book](http://www.amazon.com/Hitlers-Second-Book-Unpublished-Sequel/dp/1929631618/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8 qid=1342462243 sr=8-1 keywords=hitler%27s+second+book) as well as some passages in the original Mein Kampf.

Some people in Britain, by the way, thought about an alliance with Hitler. It wasn't just a one-sided love affair. How many people in Britain and how much influence they had in the country is a matter of debate, but Rudolf Hess was almost certainly trying to contact these elements when he flew to the UK in 1941. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Actually, Paulides is a bigfoot investigator, and probably first heard about these cases while interviewing park rangers about bigfoot. He tries hard to keep the areas of his life separate because he doesn't want to be the "crazy bigfoot guy" who also does missing-persons cases, but his Amazon page gives him away.

Still, the pattern of cases is no myth and they can be verified in local newspapers and police reports. They could use an advocate with better credibility than Paulides. He is ex-law enforcement but whether it's fair or not, his involvement with bigfoot will make many people immediately discount his other work which is unfortunate. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A hundred years ago, a large percentage of women were homemakers.

"homemaking" was a hard job and often included much child care and farmwork. Yes, people still have kids today, but caring for nine or ten as compared to one or two is quite different. Today hardly anyone cares for nine or ten kids without it being an employed position (teacher, child care center worker, etc.) I would not count the housewives of the 19th century as being "unemployed" in the modern sense. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sort of correct. The tractor and mechanical thresher did force millions of farm workers off the land. They moved to the cities though and found industrial work in the factories which were booming, but when the 1930's depression hit they could not just "go back to the farms" like city-dwellers had done in previous downturns. That's when the starvation and homelessness started.

It's interesting to read about the Great Depression in France where smallholdings, gov't policy and social customs limited farm automation. The Depression was less severe in France (though still bad) because many laid-off workers simply went back to the family farm. </TEXT>

Don't assume so quickly. I've been reading Ben Franklin's accounts of his trips to England. He had conversations with the upper class where they openly discussed how to start a big war to get rid of the excess population. Eventually they decided (economically) forced emigration to North America and later (legally) forced emigration to Australia were better options, but they considered mass graves.

	<TEXT> It was about a woman who had kept a dead Christmas tree in her house since 1993, decorations and all, and documented its decomposition over time. She lost friends over the "creepiness" of the tree, but wouldn't give it up. According to what I overheard, she even got the tree declared an "artistic landmark" by "the city" and exempted from laws which would have made her throw it out. (not sure which city, but it could be NYC or Philly.) Supposedly it aired on PBS - though maybe only locally.

Has anyone heard of this documentary, and if so, is it available online? I tried asking r/documentaries. Two people had seen it, one thought he remembered the title as "Mad City Tannenbaum," but I couldn't find any reference to that title online. The other could not remember the title.

Further details: The two people talking knew this woman personally, and she seemed to have some mental problems but also some political influence. </TEXT>

If you stop making car payments, the lender gives your license plate number to the police. Especially with the increasing numbers of police departments with automatic plate-scanners mounted on their cruisers, you will probably be found.

Edit: Oh, and I forgot, it is also possible that you will be charged with stealing the car. In your car loan it says if you can't make the payments you must immediately surrender the vehicle. Technically, the bank owns the car until you make the last payment. Trust me, stopping car payments is not a good idea. Better to sell the car and get something cheaper if possible. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I ask this because the other day I walked into a restaurant with my girlfriend. The maitre d' station was unmanned and beyond it was just a stairway leading down underground. We knew the place was open because I could hear rock music and people talking plus normal restaurant sounds (plates, glasses, etc.) coming from downstairs. 

But... there was creepy clown stuff everywhere on the walls in the entranceway and leading down the stairwell. I could also see the edge of a jukebox downstairs and this frightened me too for some reason. I am not afraid of clowns in the least and neither is the gf but something told us to get the hell out of there and we did. 

We had to walk blocks and blocks to find another restaurant and now I feel somewhat embarrassed at being such a chicken and running away from a restaurant because of clown stuff on the walls. By the menu outside it looked like they had good food and beer too. 

On the other hand, we might have just barely avoided being chopped to pieces by killer clowns. It got me to thinking, who here has had the strong instinct to leave a place for no specific reason but ignored that instinct? What happened then (good or bad)?   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've always had a soft spot for the Polynesian theory but I must admit most of the recent evidence is against it.

I still think there's a Polynesian influence on Japanese architecture - perhaps spread by merchants which became a prestige form - and on the pronunciation if not the underlying grammar and root syllables of the language. I can't prove any of this, it's just a semi-educated hunch. I used to think Japanese was most likely an Altaic-Polynesian trade creole but this seems increasingly unlikely, especially with the discovery of proto-Japanese forms in Korea. </TEXT>

*Some* people, yes, but not necessarily a large number that would change the genetic character of a population. Material cultures have been known to spread in pre-history without corresponding changes in the physical characteristics of a population. Interestingly, there are sometimes small numbers of distinct "foreigner" burials - probably remains of the merchants or outcasts who spread the material culture. I'm not sure if this is the case in Japan or not. I know this phenomenon is documented in prehistoric Britain and elsewhere in Europe.

The culture you're thinking of is the Jomon. Studies I've seen have said that modern Japanese ancestors are anywhere from 10-40% Jomon, with the remainder being Korean in origin. </TEXT>

A common misconception. The spread of a material culture does not always imply the spread of large numbers of immigrant peoples. The same rice culture spread from China to Korea, and the Chinese and Koreans are genetically distinct.

	<TEXT> It was about a woman who had kept a dead Christmas tree in her house since 1993, decorations and all, and documented its decomposition over time. She lost friends over the "creepiness" of the tree, but wouldn't give it up. According to what I overheard, she even got the tree declared an "artistic landmark" by "the city" (not sure which city, but it could be NYC or Philly.) Supposedly it aired on PBS - though maybe only locally.

Has anyone heard of this documentary, and if so, is it available online? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree. I personally don't believe that AP is "real" as in scientifically real (it would seem so easy to get hard evidence if it was - just put random words on a piece of paper inside a locked room or something), but nevertheless it is "real" in the realm of experience, and I find it fascinating.

Personally I think AP is a kind of lucid dream but one where the dreamworld is a replication of the room where you went to sleep and it is not easy to change which is a different sort of experience from a normal lucid dream. I had one such lucid dream in college where I wandered around my dorm, then "fell" through a wall and ended up on the street outside. Unfortunately, then I woke up so I didn't get to further explore the experience. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There was a study I read about (can't remember where), which measured the IQs of chess grandmasters, and the mean IQ was actually subnormal to a statistically significant degree. Not terribly so, it was somewhere in the mid 90's, but it put paid to the myth of the chess "genius." 

Apparently these grandmasters had spent so much time focusing on such a narrow skill (often from a very early age), that their wider reasoning skills had never developed properly. 

Could at least partially explain all that Bobby Fisher conspiracy theory madness. Chess doesn't drive one mad directly, it merely makes shabby intellects believe that they are geniuses in fields they know nothing about. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In theory. I'll guess that doesn't actually happen very often. As school discipline is opaque by law (at least in the US, don't know about Canada for sure), the public can't know how this policy is actually being implemented. This is to push up graduation rates, it happens in the US all the time. In many districts the lowest grade you can get for a mark is a 50 even if you never attend class once. That way, you can still "make up" the grade and get to passing by the end of the year. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, 2000 calories per day is "starving" you. Maybe if you're an athlete. Not if you're a lazy fatass who sits in a hospital bed all day.

Depending on how fat these people are, 2000/day might be a pretty significant calorie deficit even if they are just sitting in bed. Larger mass bodies do take more calories just to keep everything "ticking over." This can be an advantage to weight loss, actually, the fat works in your favor in the beginning, but if a person feels forced into it I can easily see it setting off a panic response (which is why "fat camps" for kids rarely work...) </TEXT>

E[Y(t)]/E(t)~=n*mu/sum(x)
