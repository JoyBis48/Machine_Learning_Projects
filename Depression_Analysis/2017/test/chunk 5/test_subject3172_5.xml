	<TEXT> It's easy to say "just go with it, get lost in the moment," whatever, but sometimes we feel self-conscious without meaning to, and get stuck there, like a centipede thinking about its feet. In those moments it'd be nice to have some ideas to fall back on. 

The insistence that you should always "just know" what do to in bed needs to die a quick and painful death. If it really worked that way, no one would need to ask for advice. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you can't wait till morning, PCL this late probably has a couple of quiet empty corners, especially along the east wall; there's some secluded chairs back there. I saw a guy a few hours ago napping on some chairs he'd pushed together. Some of the group study rooms should be empty, too.

During the day, first choice is /u/bste2015's suggestion of the SSB's relaxation room. The study rooms at PCL may be full, but it's worth checking. 

Third floor of the Union has some comfortable chairs in a hallway by the east windows. It's not exactly private, but it's nice and quiet and nobody bothers you. </TEXT>

My workplace just switched to a Microsoft Exchange mail server. As part of the switch they went around to everyone's PC and installed MS Outlook and some other networking gizmos.

They gave everyone the same email password and put the word out that passwords wouldn't be changing for 45 days.

Everyone. Has. The. Same. Password. And everyone knows what it is.

They did this ON PURPOSE.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> "Be yourself" is incomplete and confusing advice. A good, full version would be "Be true to yourself," which is more liberating. So if you want to talk to someone, you'd like them to feel at ease so they will engage you, and to do that, you put on a pleasant expression, for instance. You may not feel particularly good in the moment, but you truly want to enjoy their company, and thus you want them to enjoy yours. If you overdo it to the point you're just putting on a false front, that's another thing. 

Same with saying pleasant things even if you're not feeling good or charitable; you want the other person to hear what you're saying, really hear it and understand it, so you do what you can to say it in a way they'll listen to. Your instinct may be to say, for instance, "That's fucking bullshit," but you also know that the other person will just get defensive and dismiss your opinion, and that's not what you want.^1 If you say "Are you sure? What about ..." or some such, then your message will get through. You're working harder but being truer to yourself.

	<TEXT> The 2 is NOT a loser here. In fact, this particular suit is difficult to assess, because the number of spades you will lose depends on how the opponents' spades are distributed. If they each have 2, you can play the AK and collect them all and have no losers. If one opponent has Qxx, though, the Queen will take a trick, because after you win the AK the Queen will be the highest spade, and it will win one trick. (If the opponent who plays after the Jxxxx hand has QT98, then you have two losers. That's a distant possibility.)

Note that in each case, after you play the AK and, if necessary, play a third round to make them take their Queen, the rest of the spades are winners, not losers.

Remember that counting losers is only useful in a *suit* contract, because as soon as you're out of a suit, the next time the opponents play it you can win the trick by trumping. You can only do this if you have trump, though, so it's most useful to count losers in the hand with the longer trump holding.

So a loser is any card in a suit in the long-trump hand that you will have to lose before you can start trumping. So if your diamonds are Axx opposite Kxx, you know you can win the A and K, but you have to lose the third trick before you can trump their diamond plays, because you have to follow suit three times before you can use your trump.

So, sometimes (as with Axx opposite Kxx) you can count your losers in a suit right away, and sometimes (as with AKxxx opposite Jxxxx) you won't know for sure until you find out how the opps' cards are distributed. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's partly the specific foods and partly the context: Using food to get those feelings unrelated to nutrition. Somewhere I saw a study that said addiction doesn't happen unless you go through all of these stages: Use, stop using, feel withdrawal, use to ease withdrawal feelings. Soon you get used to using those endorphins to deal with other kinds of stress.

I sometimes go back to something a friend told me, about someone he know who worked in an auto body shop, where they use paints that do bad things to your brain when you inhale their vapor. He'd drink heavily after work every day, and if you asked about it he'd say, "After a day with those chemicals I'm fucked up. Drinking is a fucked-up I can deal with."

Same with overeating. I've sometimes counted myself lucky that at least I eat instead of drinking to deal with stress, but that's just less bad, not good. </TEXT>
