	<TEXT> I just did a search... I can't find anyone who's created a database for the specific purpose of recording salt-ruined land.

I'd suppose a better way to do it would be to narrow down the area of the country/world that you want to live in... and start doing research in *that* area specifically.  From what I *was* running across, California seems a pretty prime target.    ...but, if I were wanting to buy farm land in California, I'd hold out a bit longer ... ...fore, if what I'm seeing pans out, farmers will be abandoning their land in *droves* due to their inability to continue to work said land using the practices that they've grown accustomed to... ...and, as such, the stuff'll probably start flooding the market...  just a hunch though.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  I bet I could sit here and come up with some issues that you may not consider a big deal to the environment

oh I have *no* misconceptions that my *main* 'day job' is an environmental disaster; from deforestation to habitat destruction, from run off issues to ... well, really, the list is probably 'endless'.  Methods I've taken towards my 'side jobs' have even led to discussions, debates, even flat out arguments over the environmentally positive merits of its/their environmental benefits.   I didn't realize that that was what was up for discussion here though.

 Everything that needs regulated is regulated.

this statement... hell, even the grammar you used to type it with is... ridiculous, let alone the statement itself.  Let me ask this, if the system *isn't* perfect then how could 'everything that needs regulated' *be* 'regulated' properly? 

 The fact that you think a back yard gardener needs nitrate control shows how asinine your reasoning is.

I didn't say that backyard gardeners need nitrate control.... though I didn't say they *didn't* either. I think that really just depends, ... and depends on multiple variables of which there are countless different variables coming into play here from neighborhood rules   regs to environmental predeterminations. 

What I *did* say was that 'implementations' can scale from the largest farms down to even the backyard gardener. 

I've seen fertilizer put on potted plants on someone's deck drip down through the bottom of the hanging baskets into the streams below (think apartments with balconies that back up to natural wooded areas) and cause an excess amount of growth *in* that 'wild area' ... to the same thing happening to the grass beneath someone's deck in their backyard.

I've seen overzealous yard-owners who want their backyard to look as green as the golf course to which it backs up 'over do' their fertilizations in such that their backyard hill ran its runoff into the golf course pond behind it and create algae blooms like none-other *in* said pond.

Hell, my mom used to clean out the backyard pond deal in her backyard when it'd get too much algae in it, let it drain down the hill in the backyard to the sewer pipe area that ended in some wetland deal that's also back there... ... refill the pond, fertilize the beds around it, then a hard rain come a few days later and all the algae from the pond-cleaning combine with the extra fertilizer she too-liberally applied and... ...that 'wetland' deal down below? blew up with algae, weeds, mosquitoes, and all sorts of other vermin... 

so, sticking with my original sentiment that even an overly fertilized hanging basket to a backyard garden can benefit from properly implemented runoff management.   (my mom's 'problem' was solved by planting a line of 'pond-crops' (read: cattails and others) in a swale that was cut right at the bottom of the hill running the property line... ...that way the water run off would go into the swale, along with any excess fertilizer and any algae from the water she pumped out of the pond... ...and, when that'd happen, whatever she had growing in that swale would blow up...  created a really nice yard effect, so much so that the neighbors next door and the next one down also implemented the same system (or more continued it) and... it created a really nice 'natural' look to the whole thing.   also drastically reduced the 'vermin' that would result from the wetland deal where it ended (mice, rats, opossums, snakes, racoons, etc).

Jump to farming systems.  Before we switched one of our back fields from traditional corn/soy rotation b.s. to switchgrass... and dug swales into it on contour before the switchgrass seed broadcasting... we had a path wide enough for our 4-wheeler to ride between the rows and the wild area next to it.  ... when it'd rain, the runoff from that field would quickly flow over the path, into the wild area... through it, farther down the hill and into that section of the creek below.

It was really sloppy. Algae would blow up in the stream   creek, the area would become super weedy... riding or walking the field would result in countless bug bites hassles and other annoyances.   We kept the path, but dug a three lines of swales in this ~45 acre field...  on contour, the bottom one running just along the edge of the path, and in such a way that it ran at a slight angle so that the water would 'pool' at a low point in the field... 

planted the switchgrass... now it's not an issue.  but, for the first 1.5 years, the swales worked perfectly, the water runoff was drastically reduced as the switchgrass grew and established itself, the water that *did* make it down was caught in the bottom swale, ran to the low point pool and gathered there.... had to put a metal grate over the path so we could ride the 4-wheeler over it w/out getting mud-bath-stuck in it.....  and we planted a bunch of fast growth misc there.

Runoff's not an issue any more that the switchgrass has established itself, the metal grate has since been removed   moved elsewhere on the farm, and the 'pseudo wetland' of runoff has since become a dry area of essential nothingness due to essentially *no* runoff making it there due to the soil absorbing everything that used to.   The woods is no more 'explosive' in growth than any other of the woods bordering the farm... and the stream   creek haven't had algae explosions the same way since.

Point is, from 'industrial agriculture' to 'backyard gardener'... proper runoff management can go a long way.

comfy desk job?   for part of the day? yeah. ... I come in, i sit at a desk... and, yes, I've had multiple compliments on the 'comfiness' of my office chairs...  mom   pop producers? ... i'll leave a response to the irony of *that* statement as yet another reflection of your... ...of your need to rant ignorantly on reddit. </TEXT>

sticking to your logic: increased cattle = increased cow shit = possibility for increased nitrogen runoff


I think it has less to do with the quantity of nitrogen runoff and more the 'how' of it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> they blame politics... politicians blame 'proliferation risks'.

but, yet, we're spending as much money on our nuclear weapons industry as ever... upgrading/updating weapons as quickly as we need to, and building countless *other* weapons at scales unseen in history.

it would seem that if the politicians were *as* good as their campaign promises imply that they are, they'd be able to create a national and/or international organization that creates an accounting organization that accounts for all weapons grade material that comes out from the reprocessing facilities...

...and, in such a way that it would give *more* control, awareness,...and.. assurances that the materials *aren't* going towards weapons.

...as well, are being safely handled/handled properly... 


I was really hoping that the Iran treaty would see Iran pushing some sort of program like this onto the international stage... but, it doesn't look like it.   granted, negotiations aren't over yet but...

if the IAEA can police nuclear material the world over *now*... how hard would it be for them to create 'nuclear 'cops'   regulators' ... a nuclear 'task force' of rotating agents loyal to the IAEA and *not* the country in which they're stationed... ...in such as to monitor   account for the materials on a day-to-day basis.

proliferation risks would be even *less* likely.. as would nuclear 'disasters'.

and, in the process, we'd create more fuel than we'd know what to do with.

and *there* I think is the *real* reason it isn't done.

imagine what would happen to nuclear fuel prices if even 10% of nuclear weapons were dismantled and their bomb material converted to reactor use for civilian purposes...

let alone 50-75%.  ...and that'd *still* leave the world with *more* than enough nuclear weapons to blow itself to hell multiple times over.

	<TEXT>  Reprocessing used fuela to recover uranium (as reprocessed uranium, or RepU) and plutonium (Pu) avoids the wastage of a valuable resource. Most of it  about 96%  is uranium, of which less than 1% is the fissile U-235 (often 0.4-0.8%); and up to 1% is plutonium. Both can be recycled as fresh fuel, saving up to 30% of the natural uranium otherwise required. The materials potentially available for recycling (but locked up in stored used fuel) could conceivably run the US reactor fleet of about 100 GWe for almost 30 years with no new uranium input. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, it's essentially activated carbon (it actually *is* a.c. but from biomass vs coal, so on the one hand it isn't (usually) as porous not activated, on the other, it generally retains the vascular structure of the source feedstock...which proves beneficial in getting nutrients into   out of it)...so it's generally priced accordingly: ~$1/lb ... Though it's better priced volumetrically vs by weight.

That being said, it totally depends on application rates.

Truthfully, it isn't necessarily cost-effective when looked at from a short term perspective..other additives bring a more immediate ROI.

But the medium   long-term effects...benefits...would more than pay for itself.

/r/biochar is loaded with posts about how to both limit any more-immediate negatives that result from the changes it does to the soil, as well how to make its benefits more immediately ROI'able.

That said, you're absolutely correct that poorer soils would benefit more from it, ...and poor soils tend to get more done to them at one time... ...within limits of cost, return, and overall profitability of the crops.

But, I'm of the opinion that it's equally as important, if not more so even, to get it into already high quality soils...to help to *keep* them higher quality...

...as they're the ones that tend to be both the most relied upon, as well the ones that are worked the *hardest*.

...*then* work down the line, making the lowest quality soils a lower priority.

Also, higher quality soils *tend* to be worked by more profitable, as well, more likely to be able to afford farmers.

This would give the industry the chance to get on its feet, get the infrastructure in place (as well a wider diversity of understanding how to utilize it), then allow economics of scale to kick in to both lower the price, as well increase the availability to lower quality soils that tend to have lower profit margins.

Obviously the ideal would also be the most likely 'deployment' of it: multiple qualities simultaneously.

But the stuff definitely seems like it provides the 'kick' the world  needs on multiple fronts: energy, soil, food, carbon, water, fertilizer, pesticide reduction, etc </TEXT>
