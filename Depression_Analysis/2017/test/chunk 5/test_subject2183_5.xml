	<TITLE> Long term effects of shallow rapid breathing? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-01-29 14:47:44 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> We were on a roadtrip when someone was depressed saying that he wanted to kill himself; my sister pretended to have a panic attack

** Very shallow rapid breathing, when i mean fast, the fastest you can breathe in and out. Over and over for 2 minutes (I know very very unhealthy) he stopped with the suicide talking and she stopped with the fake panic attack**

Now the bad part: she told me that she didn't feel like herself, like she had lost a part of herself when she did that, like a part of her brain had turned off. the brig problem is that i've heard of people getting perm brain damage because of breathing such as this (especially 2 minutes of that rapid breathing)

it was similar to this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SQFoyRfQGc

but instead of filling the lungs she only allowed minimal amount of air in and out very rapidly over and over for 2 minutes

what are the possible effects in the long term?

what happens to someone when they do this for 2 minutes 5,8,10 etc </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> For years I was raised a christian, told about how heaven awaits. Neuroplastisity is my guess as to why the feeling of death is still exciting and is something i'm looking forward to after life. I know logically now that after death the chances are it's non-existence but as a habit the idea of heaven waiting for me as a reward is still there. It's sad really because of this I feel like I can't value life. Only sometimes do I intuitively understand; yes after this it's non existence ,very tragic; live your life to the fullest!. I wish those moments occurred more often. The idea of heaven or some sort of excitement for the mystery of post life won't get out of my head! :( :/ </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Once me and a friend saw a ball of flies consisting of around 4 flies; rolling around very fast, about the speed of a bowling ball. This was at school.

Several other occasions i've encountered strange things like someone throwing a pen across the classroom and it lands in someones pocket.

I used to have a tennis ball and whenever i would get lost somehow we would re-unite over and over again. (very strange reminds me of quantum entanglement or something)

I had a paper aeroplane that I threw off a balcony and it turned around and went somewhere on the hotel roof. I said to my sister "It will return to me just like my tennis ball watch"
Few minutes latter we wear a 'tang' and the plane is in the barbeque that was on the balcony.

other things: rolling a die with the same number, getting strange streaks in probability games like tactics arena I had a 1% chance of hitting an enemy that would make the difference between winning and losing, I decided to take the shot and I got it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Instead of sitting down and doing nothing, so far I've come up with:

1. Learning C++ and C#, or reading a well known philosophy book; these have to be done in the most efficient way possible.

2. Focus on doing those activities. When ever distractions arise; I make a conscious effort to focus again. This will train my brain to have discipline and endurance to focus via neuroplasticity; instead of being an ADD multi-tasker.

I still fail to convince myself why those are worth my time. I think time is one of the most valuable assets we have. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> At the start of this 53 day streak I covered my glans with saran wrap. 

This was done because it's a method of restoring sensitivity and dekeratinization in circumcised guys. I have a small slit to urinate and I take it all off at night.


This 53 day streak is my first streak over 7 days and I have a feeling that the saran wrap may be a contributing factor. I fear that the saran wrap could be a negative contributing factor to me getting such a high streak because I don't feel "super powers". I've been flat lining the whole time as well, no urges at all. In my previous streaks that were around 5 days each I felt a lot of superpowers, exactly the same as the ones others would write testimonies about.

What are your thoughts and what do you guys think of the science behind my predicament? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was trying to deposit from special savings account 1 into term deposit 2 because of a slightly better rate.
Special savings accounts give you a ton of more interest if you make one deposit and no withdrawals for that month. (it's a condition for those types of accounts)

------------------------------------

 I spent days doing the math trying to figure out if I would lose more or gain more if I transferred money from the special account to the term deposit since the rate is higher on the term deposit but you violate the special account rule where you can't make a withdrawal for the month.


-----------------

Today I spent ages talking with an employee, we finally did the complex maths and I was about to come to my decision of transferring it at the expense of about $200 worth of extra interest (I would lose $200 very bad idea) because of violating the withdrawal rule. 
Suddenly clarity in my mind.

--------------------------------------

If I transfer money from special account 1 to my term deposit I will not get extra interest on special account 1 for that month.

I can transfer all of the remaining money from special account 1 to special account 2 which will then give me extra interest for that month thus saving my ass from flushing $200 down the toilet.

-------------------------------------

A simple solution to such a complex situation. I got relief and fear at the same time thinking "what if that never occurred to me?"I got to make sure this happens more often. </TEXT>

The shepherd, however, bit as my cry counseled him; he bit with a good bite. Far away he spewed the head of the snake  and he jumped up. No longer shepherd. no longer human  one changed, radiant,

 * *** laughing! Never yet on earth has a human being laughed as he laughed! O my brothers, I heard a laughter that was no human laughter; and now a thirst gnaws at me, a longing that never grows still. My longing for this laughter gnaws at me; oh, how do I bear to go on living! And how could I bear to die now!***

For me in the long term I wish I knew the mechanisms of neuroscience, and how a repeating habit makes you more familiar and able. How many tasks numb your pleasure receptors and how pleasurable things are bad for us most of the time, while difficult unpleasant things are good for us. If i knew this I would have stopped the tasty food, the comfort, the gaming, the sexual videos etc.

In the short term I wish I knew about kegel exercises they provide much more freedom and many health benefits.

	<TEXT> Already saw the doctor twice, he gave me iburophen and it didn't have an effect on me.

He did an x-ray and the results showed nothing important.

I saw a third doctor about it and he saw my history and he said that he will prescribe me with neurophen and there is nothing else we can do and that it's not something to be worried about

it makes me feel sick though, it's very uncomfortable and it might be getting worse </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Great advice and be aware that almost everyone is being overexposed to images of humans looking too good, in commercials, advertisements people putting in effort to look good, it because habitual for us to have higher expectations because of this neuroplasticity, so don't overexpose yourself and you'll find yourself being attracted to the average person, naturally people don't look anything like what you see in magazines, movies and the biggest culprit: too much porn </TEXT>
