	<TEXT> Marth's unavailable, but Wii Fit Trainer is. 

I've already got Villager, which other ones are rare enough to get before December?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> **1. What amiibo figure would you like to see in the future?:** 

I'd definitely like to see some more varied characters to fill up what Smash Bros. doesn't already have, such as Captain Toad, Waluigi, Ridley, Tom Nook, etc. Plus, third-party figures like Rayman and Bayonetta would be cool. 

**2. What other types of amiibo functionality do you want?:** 

I'd like to see a sandbox-styled game where you can use the characters o build your own games based off their franchises. Think Disney Infinity and LittleBigPlanet combined. Plus, using amiibos as the playable characters, combined with unlocking specific parts/textures/items/vehicles would be cool. 

**3. Thoughts/Suggestions for /r/amiibo (if any):** 

I'd like to see some sort of way to find the amiibos and where they're in stock, such as if they're out of order or if they're exclusives.

	<TEXT> 3DS was basically "Make sure to play as all of the characters! Do you know about this mode? Try it out! Collect all the trophies! Have fun!"

Wii U is "You're going to know every character inside and out. You will have to know EACH FRAME OF EVERY ANIMATION or else you're screwed. One wrong move costs you EVERYTHING. You're going to effing bleed if you want the Knuckle Joe trophy. Welcome to 20XX, bitch." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We've experimented with several menus, but we've never been able to load the amiibo on. We can't find any specific sub-menu for it, and it's been bothering us all day. How do we scan the amiibos in Hyrule Warriors? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Villager is "Destroyer", based off my brother's previous Destroyer shtick. 

Link's "HeroOfTime". 

Mario is "Gonzales." Like in Thousand Year Door.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I really think that Sakurai needs to look at some other resources for Ridley, considering that PM fan model we saw a while back. With a fanbase that big, and a slightly smaller hatebase, you'd think he'd try a bit more to incorporate him. 

A bit off topic, but I'm really hating the fact that 5-6 morons are being used as the definiton of "Ridley supporter" and anyone who does want Ridley is a delusional maniac. I'd appreciate it if every time I get into a debate, people stop pulling the same cards on me and telling me I have no idea what I'm talking about.

	<TEXT> Villager and Toon Link. He's also looking a bit at Mega Man (Because "lemons") and Ness. He seems to gravitate towards the younger characters, considering he also liked Lucas in Brawl.  </TEXT>
