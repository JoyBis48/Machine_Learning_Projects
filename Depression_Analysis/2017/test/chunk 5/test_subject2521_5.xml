	<TEXT> I was so excited when I bought my new phone and failed to read through the details. From now on, I won't be talked in to purchasing it. I might actually point out how much of a scam it is to the store employee. 

Mailed my phone to Cell Phone Repair (CPR) store. Hopefully the estimate won't be too much. It of course broke AFTER I got back from the city that has the store. Unfortunately, I do not want to make that 1.5 hr drive again. A sh*t load of construction + college students = a bad time. 

It's a Google Nexus 5. :-) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The answer is yes, but more so no. 

Via a close-friend who is a former Orthodox Jew. 

Shmuley Boteach is such a schmuck. He just wants to sell Orthodox Judaism in a way that looks hip and cool and to make Orthodox Judaism seem less like...Orthodox Judaism. What he doesn't say is that you have to ritually wash your hands before and after sex, the man has to recite certain psalms before entering the woman, and that it is *best* to be covered with a sheet or blanket, which means that you kind of have to do it in missionary otherwise a sheet will slip off, and why would you do it a different way if you could do it the *better* way? The man also has to wear his kippah during sex. Now, Shmuley isn't Chassidic, but we were Lubavitch, which means the woman has to keep her hair covered during sex. Oh, and sure, the "niddah" period during the period and for an additional week leads to lust, but don't you sometimes want to hug each other? You can't share the same bed during that time? The woman can't even SIT on the man's bed during that time so as to not arouse him. You cannot pass things directly to each other and you have to put something on the table when you sit together to serve as a reminder that you cannot touch or pass things to each other. You cannot even pass a baby to each other. Sure, *sets it next to my hand on counter*, then I pick it up.

Edit: forgot a few words. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Husband yelling at wife for never doing anything right. Wife gets up, crying, and leaves. Husband and daughter remain at table. Husband then decides to call and yell at his wife. 

I sat there trying not to notice, but they were seated directly across from our table and in my line of view. My Dad asked why I didn't speak up and say something, I was the only one at the table who heard the commotion; I didn't want to piss off the Husband and receive an unnecessary bitching. Felt so sorry for their daughter. Unfortunately she might be used to it.

This was at a fancy restaurant in Plano, TX.

	<TITLE> Contacting my biological father </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-09-04 20:57:27 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Through 23andMe I started to question whether the individual I came to know as my Dad was in fact my biological father. Turns out I was right. I never brought it up to my parents because we were going through enough stress at the time. 

Mid-August, my Mom finally came clean with the information. She was legally responsible in telling us (as stated in court documents) and withheld this information from us for over a decade. The documents permitted her to release the information once we (myself and my siblings - two older brothers) reached 18 years of age. I am the youngest and now 27. I laughed when my Mom brought out the legal papers. She asked why and I told her I had figured it out months ago. She was upset I never mentioned it to her, and I wish I hadn't waited. 

I know who he is, know where he lives. I even know and have is phone number. I've called at least once a day for the past few weeks, but no one answers and the call goes straight to voice mail. I wonder if they have caller ID and decide not to answer (so I often call with an unknown number) or his wife deletes my number (which is screwed up seeing how she's a licensed psychologist - yes, I've done my research). Either way, I have had no luck.

One thing I really find unnerving is ~~that~~ the fact I always wish I had a sister. Turns out I have two older half-sisters and one half-brother. I had a third older half-sister but she passed away in 1983. My middle name was in honor of her. 

Would it be wrong for ~~my~~ me to leave a message on their answering machine or messaging him over Facebook? I want to meet him. Based on what my Mom has shared, we have a lot in common; and what I have discovered through my own research.  As a kid, I always brought up ideas and concepts that my Mom thought were stupid and I finally understand why - it's something he would have thought or been in favor of doing. 

I saw him once, but didn't know who he was. I was 18 years-old and out to eat at Panera with my Mom. After bringing the food back to the table I told her that a table of older men kept staring at me. I do not recall her reply, but once they left the restaurant, she informed me it was him.  </TEXT>

For pricing, she might accept your insurance or provide some sort of payment options. You'll have to discuss that with her.

Perhaps I have a different reaction to caffeine. Either way, it is quite annoying.

	<TEXT> Have you cut open a tube afterwards to see if there's anything left? I get the feeling that some makeup might be stuck to the sides of the tube. 

Either way, that's a great idea. Thanks for sharing!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Did you even read the story? His wife did everything possible to not get him deported; but even that didn't work. Now he's banned from entering the US, returning to the life he had lived for 20 years, for 10 years. Sorry, but that's f*cked up. There are more than enough illegal immigrants who could be deported, not someone who has made a life for himself and someone else.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you! I've missed fishing. My step-dad sold my fishing gear once I moved out and off to college. Spending that day at the lake (more so reservoir) with my boyfriend and his dad was so much fun! We've decided to turn it into a weekly adventure (have 7-8 locations to choose from).

Bama as in Alabama? Sounds more exciting that KS...haha.

If not, they're located in most malls.

They sell clothes, toys, music, movies and other Disney trinkets.

The one I went to has a small theater area playing nothing but Frozen.
