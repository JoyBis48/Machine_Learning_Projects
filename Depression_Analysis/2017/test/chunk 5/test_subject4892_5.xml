Not to mention a lot of jurisdictions have blended the two torts together anyways so assault could have been a valid here absent the sexual nature of the offense; even though the whole point is moot because it's all American law and they're not in America.

	<TEXT> I just did a rough calculation of our BCS title game chances. Assuming  
1) Alabama wins out, including UGA in the SECCG (%75)  
2) We win out (~60%)  
3) no team behind us is going to jump us  
4) KSU, ND, and Oregon need two losses for us to jump them.  
5) we pass USCe after our win over florida + ACC championship game

There is like a 10% chance KSU gets at least two losses and a 15% chance Oregon gets at least two losses. There's about a 12.5% chance that ND loses two more times.

If we assume (incorrectly) that all of these are independent probabilities, that puts our title chances at .75 x .6 x .1 x .15 x .125 = .085% and that's being very optimistic

	<TEXT> Sagarin's overall rankings are made up of two formulas. ELO_Chess only takes into account who you've beaten and who you've lost to without regard to by how much. Then Predictor, which only takes into account margin of victory and completely disregards whether you've won or lost. The two are averaged out somehow, and comes up with his ranking, which is still a bit quirky, but pretty good for a computer. 

The BCS decided to only use the ELO_CHESS portion of his formula for their computer ranking. I don't know the reason, I think the idea *might* be to correct for the amount of human bias pollsters can put into their rankings or something. It's a very weird decision though, IMO. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Typing this from a phone so forgive the errors and brevity-

I love this film because there's a perspective here that a lot of people seemed to miss: I see this story as told *through the lense* of the main character, a 9 year okd boy scout.

Think about the characters. The girl's parents are lawyers, so what do they do lying in bed? They talk about boring adult lawyer things. Edward Norton is shown as having an immensly crisp routine as scoutmaster, because a young boyscout would see his scoutmaster as being comparatively a robot. Notice how resourveful he is when they're travelling through the woods? He likes to see himself as a person caoable of surviving in the woods, and her as some silly girl who doesn't now how to pack or prepare for real wilderness. Notice how 'social services' is represented by a cold, mean old lady? That's exactly the kind of personification a 9 year old would have of a social services worker. Notice how innocuous the afair was represented? It's because that's what having affair is to him.

I see this not as an objective story with a caraciturized cast, but as a story told through the imaginative mind of a young boy. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sure.

We're 6-1 with our only loss coming by one point on the road to a team who's 4-2 right now. We've beaten a team that's currently ranked (13th USA, 14th AP).

We have the 6th best scoring offense in the nation, (you can point to the fact that we've played two AA teams this year, but I'd rebut by saying one of them ended with 20 minutes left so it someone mitigates stat-inflating). We're ranked 12th in the nation in total offense (23rd passing, 16th rushing; so incredibly well balanced). Also our quarterback is currently ranked 4th in the nation in passing efficiency. 

We have the 4th best total scoring defense in the nation, allowing 11.6points/game. We're ranked 3rd in the nation in total defense; including being 5th overall in rushing defense and 3rd in passing efficiency defense. 

Our strength of schedule isn't great, sure, but it's not awful either. I'd say collectively that's a resume of a top-25 team at least. </TEXT>

What are the best ways to prepare for the REG exam in these areas? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> At the high school level... 

1) there are so many things so absurdly more important than Wickard for a government class; to spend 3% of the entire school year on it is a horrendous misappropriation of time

2) like you said, I doubt it's even on the radar for the AP U.S. history exam

3) Inasmuch as a high schooler who's just now learning about the governent is concerned; there is probably about 10-15 minutes worth of good substantive teaching that they could understand about it. </TEXT>
