I was in Germany with my family visiting my grandparents, I remember getting Love of Gold for my 10th birthday (Yes, I was way a head of my age with music, books and film; I still am)  and I remember waking up at exactly 7:00 in the morning and walking into the out onto the front porch  with the CD. It was beautiful outside, the sun was rising and the snow was gently melting off the grass and trees; it was beautiful. I remember sitting down and putting the CD in the player they had on the porch. For the whole 14 minutes I was blown away, just sitting on the porch to my grandparents house, looking out across the grass and forest. I'll never forget that day, after that I would listen to the song every morning. It is unarguably one of the best songs ever written and performed. Words can't even describe it. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> My idea for the stand-alone Batman film that has been announced </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-04-30 11:41:44 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Instead of exhausting Batman's origin story, put him in a completely new setting with characters and themes that we haven't seen before. I was thinking of a Arkham Asylum-ish story. Never have we seen Batman psychologically torn, put him right in the middle of insanity, and see how he pushes through it. Now THAT would be interesting.

For those of you who don't know, Arkham Asylum: A serious house on serious earth is a graphic novel, arguably one of the most disturbing and dark. Basically what it is about is there has been an outbreak in AA and Batman has been requested by the Joker, so he has to go over there to sort everything out. Ultimately, it's a psychological horror book.

The book deals with themes of insanity, and it literally looks like and is meant to symbolize a nightmarish ordeal. What I am trying to get to is that this would be a completely new on-screen reincarnation of the character.

I think we need to see a human, vulnerable and scared batman. Maybe we've already seen that with Nolan's trilogy, but I just really want to see Batman and insanity in the same movie together, and to see how he deals with it and vice versa.

Also, I think going with this tone and story, would bring a completely different take on the DC villains. So batman locks up these villains in insane asylums and prisons, then what? They are left to whither and die in filthy and disgusting environments. Seeing this I think would be brilliant.

Let me know your thoughts! I would love to hear other people's opinions on this. Yes I know, I am no writer. If you still don't know what I am trying to say, just comment or PM me, I'll be happy to elaborate.

TL;DR - I want to see [this](http://www.merlininkazani.com/images/games/7764/galeri_4.jpg) on screen

edit- of course all of you know what Arkham Asylum is! Duh! (stupid me) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree. David Ayer nor Zack Snyder are perfect directors, with that said they have done VERY good movies in the past. End of Watch is one of the most underrated movies of the decade and, personally, I enjoyed 300, Man of Steel (although far from perfect)and Watchmen.
I'm hoping they don't stuff up the iconic characters they are dealing with. Both films have potential to be really bad, but they also have potential to be really really good. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, IMO, this is the best thing Marvel have done. It is (**IMO**) better than the first. It is slightly better than Daredevil, but I think it's a little unfair to compare those two as they are completely different. 

You get to spend a lot more time with the Avengers as characters, the humor is more present and a lot better than everything Marvel have done, the action is better handled than the first, the villain is much more interesting and funnier than Loki (not to say that he was a bad villain) and there's more Avengers- Quicksilver, Scarlet Witch and Vision (ESPECIALLY Vision) make great additions to the team. It improves upon everything!

	<TEXT> I fucking loved it, one of the best films of the year already.

I was surprised, I didn't expect it to be as good as it was. They really fleshed out all the characters, especially Hawkeye. I was surprised that Ultron was so funny...in a dark but good way.  </TEXT>
