	<TEXT> These South American teams are fun to watch when they play each other. I can't remember a match where they didn't attack for 90 minutes like this. I'm amazed that Mexico put out their B team and played that well. Raul Jimenez looks like a player. He hasn't played all that much for Atletico Madrid has he? If he plays like that in La Liga this season then Simeone will be a happy man. 

Edit: Yes, I know Mexico is not from South America but they play with the same kind of style and verve. </TEXT>
