	<TEXT> OP on youtube [just posted](http://i.imgur.com/psOncPP.png) that she is friends with the owner of the dog.

edit [found a news article](http://www.dnainfo.com/chicago/20150527/west-loop/dog-walker-caught-on-camera-kicking-puppy-west-loop-building)

The building's security guard, who is stationed at the entrance, noticed the beagle dog was acting odd before they entered the building's elevator, according to the property manager. At that time, the security guard watched a live video feed from the surveillance video located in the elevator on a monitor stationed near the entrance desk.

safe to say it is the right company. </TEXT>

Do you have a source for that? I searched and the best results were all on whack job conspiracy sites and it wasn't even a real source. I've worked on elevators and i hardly doubt that. 

 Black smoke , which it mostly was, is oxygen starved.

Was there black smoke in the OP video?

	<TEXT> [This map](http://i.imgur.com/8cSk8ye.jpg) shows it better than i can explain it but it isn't exactly to scale. Mainly has do with geography of the area of the LA basin. The southern most point of the california aqueduct ends at [silverwood lake](https://goo.gl/maps/Xk0Je) which feeds the high desert mainly Hesperia/Victorville. You can see the aqueduct in the top of the google map link.

The colorado aqueduct feeds into [lake Mathews](https://goo.gl/maps/qQgvj) in Riverside. You can't see the aqueduct in the supplied link because it mostly runs underground after it reaches the mountains [around here](https://goo.gl/maps/JwVJF) via the San Jacinto tunnel.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_River_Aqueduct

On the first map i link, i live in that area marked as groundwater to the east of LA. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No shit? If you are aggressive on the way you pursue them it is just going to make them drive even more insane. Exactly what this video shows. He could have tried to keep his distance which at the 4 minute mark he was told to do so but ignored it. Even saying traffic wasn't as bad as it actually is, if you can't safely narrow down a search area after you break off a pursuit, then you don't have enough officers that clearly are needed.

It isn't like the bank robber went in and shot the place up like north hollywood. Once he robs a bank the FBI are involved, no reason to jeopardise my family or your family to capture a guy that can get away with a few thousands dollars only to be captured in a better and easier way later. Why escalate a deadly situation even more by provoking a suspect? Up until the end a single officer was in pursuit of a vehicle and it caused more danger to the public than putting a dangerous bank robber into custody.

edit - I love how you immediately downvote because you disagree

Edit - Even at the 4 minute mark the other officer says to disengage the pursuit and the main officer says copy, but continues to pursue when it gets the most dangerous.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The two recommended to me were [Buffalo Grass](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bouteloua_dactyloides) or [Zoysia grass](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoysia).

Currently most of my lawn is at least 4 different types, Mostly invaded by crabgrass, which  results in [this](http://i.imgur.com/C98MKpw.jpg). After renting an industrial power rake.

My whole lawn has a mixture of permanent shade and sun.

Please help...

edit - i know St Augustine is used around here a lot, will have to use the identification tool to find how what types i have currently, the shaded areas are different type than the ones in the sun. I also need to get rid of the shade that is currently there, the two trees that provide the shade are very old and termite infested. They are on the curbside, and would have to get the city to remove them. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ah makes sense then, as long as he has a job in the area it isn't a problem. The 15/91 is a pain in rush hour and i have spent a decent amount of time on both of them. I live in Ontario, when you said IE i thought more like Riverside/MoVal. That can be brutal to your life if you commute to LA or even the OC.

Edit - i worked a service job so it wasn't always from west LA, it was wherever my day ended, some being better than others. At least if it was bad enough i could get a motel room somewhere and be compensated for it. </TEXT>
