	<TEXT> Great, advice thanks! The SIPPS combined with ISA sounds about what I'm looking for, unfortunately I'm currently in central London so it will be a long time until the house deposit is sorted!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi all, I've only recently started to think about what my options are, I'm 22 but I figured the sooner you get started the easier it is in the long run right? 

I've already started purchasing premium bonds and have an ISA that I contribute to every month, but I'm confused as to what are the best (flexible) options out there which have a reasonably high gain.

I guess Ideally I'm looking for something I can transfer money too every month and be quite secure. Any help? </TEXT>
