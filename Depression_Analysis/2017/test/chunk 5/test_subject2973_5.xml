	<TEXT> People have said religion, but the problem goes far beyond the scope of religion. Its oppression, created by their leaders and social structure not Islam and economic disadvantage and the lack of education due to the lack of a good economy to support a knowledge base. 

People are drawn to ISIS because they believe that by joining ISIS they'll escape oppression in turn leading to a more comfortable live. THEY ARE SO WRONG. ISIS does everything that's against Islam. In Islam you'll go to hell for persecuting other religions, especially Christianity and Judaism, to which Islam shares so much with. One of the main Islamic celebrations is from God asking Abraham to sacrifice his son Isaac which is in Christianity.  Also Muslims believe is Jesus.  So it makes no sense to persecute these "unbelievers". ISIS will survive by oppression. These ISIS members think they'll be free from their current tyrannical despots but they are just feeding another tyrannical despot. 

In Islam men and women are equal in any social structure. However, people will not know this unless they're educated, in the sense of religion and the regular schooling, SIS is not going to be willing to provide education that is free of censorship. These ISIS subjects will never know what real Islam is. The Islam they'll know is the version that best fits the needs of ISIS. 

Like the Al Qa'ida, they'll garner a bad reputation for the Muslims living abroad in the West (read reddit comments below for proof). They'll do this so the Westerners are racist and stereotypical towards the Muslims in turn the oppressed joins/ understands ISIS's cause. 

The best course of action for the Western countries is not only to bomb these fuckers, but to spread what the real Islam says via radio and TV broadcasts. I assure you that most of ISIS's members are uneducated and thus they are easily deceived by ISIS's Imams because they have always been told to trust like you would trust a man in an uniform than the guy with chinos and a t shirt on.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Money isn't really the issue. The real issue is that we have lost the principles that America was founded upon. We have lost our right to privacy. We have laws like the patriot act where existing laws can be sidelined in the name of national security. Money can always be earned but our rights as citizens are gone-- possibly forever. All we can do now is make sure that those laws that violate the Principles which America was founded on gets repealed and that is the only way we can avenge the deaths of our soldiers who died to protect our freedom.

Also, there are people who don't vaccinate their kids.

That is so scary, like if one of those fuckers get some disease we are all fucked, there goes our heard immunity. 

If you are anti vaccine, just know that not vaccinating your kid could kill another vaccinated kid or HUNDREDS of other people.
