	<TEXT> I appreciate that but I hope you don't really give up. It's hard to find the right method of treatment, and there is no magic bullet, but you have to keep plugging on to make things better. Let me know if I can help.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's my pleasure. I would recommend starting with a therapist. They generally are more counseling oriented as opposed to medication, but if the two of you decide that's the best option they can recommend you to someone. Generally I think that's probably your best start.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Repost: A couple of minor things here and there, increased lethargy, ambivalence. The major one though was a few weeks ago I lost 10 hours. I work in a place where my day is split between two sites. I work in one for 7 hours, and another across the street for the last two. A few weeks ago I was gathering my things to leave at 7, and then woke up at 5 o'clock in my bed.

The fucked up part is I seemed to have functioned normally in the in between time. No one mentioned any abnormal behavior at work. I drove myself home, and actually made an appointment with a psychologist, so I must have known something was not right.

We're not sure yet if that is related to the depression, if it was just extreme exhaustion, or if it's something else physical. More tests coming.

	<TEXT> I was the same way until I got to the point where I was thinking about ending it. If you think you might have it and things aren't getting better, I cannot recommend going to see someone highly enough. Even if it's a school counselor, you can't always do it on your own.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 1. Often. I do not have a good diet, and never have. I'm trying to correct this but habitual behavior and budget tend to get in the way. Will be working on this in therapy.

1b. 330 with a 6'2 Frame. very overweight

2. I've been told I don't snore often. I am getting tests done in a few weeks to see if sleep apnea is a possibility. 

3. Yes. I am in my house roughly 10 hours of the day in total. 

4. Not as much as I'd like, I'm planning a big move in a few months and need to budget better than I have been, however I do treat myself from time to time.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's a specialized name that will help narrow the treatment field to get me better. Knowing that I have Dysthymia with secondary MDD gives a therapist a better idea of what they're dealing with. 

And I know you were being sardonic but seeing what you know is a beautiful day and not being able to enjoy it can be pretty damn soul crushing.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> First let me be clear that I am not a medical professional and so my advice should not be taken with the same weight as one. 

That being said, from my experience, those of my friends, and talking to counselors, the normal key things can be triggers, unusual amounts of stress, family problems, relationship problems etc, can all trigger what may have been under the surface for a while.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It depends on who you are seeing and if you have insurance. It's a specialized field so it can be pricey, but some practices are more willing to work with you than others. If you have insurance, find out if it covers mental and who is in your network. If not, start looking around. I go to a baptist behavioral health clinic. Those bigger clinics will be more able to help with prices than private practice in my experience.  </TEXT>
