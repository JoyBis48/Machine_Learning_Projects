	<TEXT> The only ones that are "easy" to polish by hand are softer sedimentary rocks. You'll have quite a bit of trouble with the obsidian by hand, even with the toughest of all sandpaper. Actually, one of things that has made polishing more fun on the ones I do by hand is using diamond files. They sound expensive--it's just synthetic grit with a handle. Much quicker and more fine-tuned than sandpaper or a sanding sponge. I have many crinoid and coral fossil specimens in a softer matrix and they clean off very well with diamond files. I cleaned matrix from a garnet (garnet schist) with the diamond files well too. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Intel has been clear though, to their great credit, that onboarding is easier than with GPUs. Still, actual users of the first-gen Phi say that optimization is still a very long process--sometimes in the end just as long as porting code to run on GPUs. The upside is that when they do that they by default get better performance on their regular Xeons.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> NVIDIA is afraid...in this space (at this point for this particular type of large-scale systems that MIC was drawn for). They owned the concept of accelerated large-scale compute but the addition of on-package memory, the ability to swap between coprocessor/plain Xeon is the only thing like it, and they have the x86/programming ecosystem. CUDA, OpenCL are great--NVIDIA GPUs offer way higher performance, but the ease is the real crux here.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Xeon Phi has only ever been a coprocessor, the point here is that it's the first processor ever to do both at the same time. It can do both--and on top of that, be programmed roughly the same way. GPUs or other accelerators require offloading and serious code hassle. When Landing hits the ground there's no more of that--and it all leverages common x86 binaries, etc. -- The 512 aspect is a minor point. A MAJOR point is also that this thing has memory on package--another first. People don't realize what a game changer this is--for users and Intel alike. Right now it's just important for highly parallel applications in HPC--in 5 years, this will be the new face of Xeon. A serious rival to other contending architectures (ARM +GPU, for instance). </TEXT>
