	<TEXT> Or 6. The number 6. Think about it six has 3 letters, 3 x 2 = an upside down 9. 9 is the prime number of 23, 23 is equal parts 2 and 3. 2 x 3 = 6. Coincidence? I think not. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ive got an insane number of things happening in my life that'd depress anyone but ever since i started insulin 3 months ago my depressed rather suddenly came to an end, and i never really found out what caused it or for that matter, ended it. So i was wondering, did anyone else get depressed BEFORE finding out they got diagnosed, due to high blood sugar etc?? and did i then go once starting insulin? Just curious </TEXT>

	<TEXT> btw folks a normal person's blood sugar is meant to be around 4-7 so you can imagine how rough these guys where feeling. Diabetes sucks, I wouldnt be here if i hadnt gotten diagnosed when i did, not because of the diabetes itself but because of the depression it caused. If you're depressed, peeing a lot, drinking a lot, get cramps, etc then get it checked out you could have type 1. </TEXT>
