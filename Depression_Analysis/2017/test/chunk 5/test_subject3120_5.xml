	<TEXT> I would avoid it.  Consider that most stores need to make at least a 25% mark up to cover overhead costs...they are probably selling it at slightly over their cost (around $150), the distributor (who also needs to make at least 25%) probably paid about $75 for it (plus shipping and import fees).   </TEXT>

You can't have heroin without poppies.  Sure you make make similar drugs in the laboratory, but they are very expensive and require government subsidies to support production and distribution.

Would it make sense to go to the places where poppies are grown and destroy the farms that grow them?  That or regulate their production and sale? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It used to be fun to quest and do dungeon runs.  Now it's super easy to quest, the loot is mediocre and the more advanced levels only have a few dungeons.

Also, part of the fun was getting to the dungeon.  Now you can just port in, do the dungeon, and get out.  Random dungeons don't have any teamwork any more.  In fact, the tank is usually ignored by dps and often not healed any more. 

Well, I guess it's a new game.  2006 was what, 9 years ago?  There's a new generation of players now and they're not the same...don't have the same gaming ethic. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> WOW has gotten cringeworthy - the lowby levels (below 70) are easy-peasey, so children are playing them.  And, yeah, they act like children.  The upper levels (70+ are yawn-inspiring.  5 dungeons per area, the quests are annoying and the loot is insipid).  Honestly don't know why I bother playing that game any more.

Guild Wars 2 is slightly better, but you can't explore the unlocked regions, there are no boats to explore the seas, and there are no mounts, so if you're into exploring, as I am, you're SOOL

Regardless of what has been said here, and elsewhere, I live in one of the richest parts of the country (Massachusetts) and I don't see any of this "element" discussed here near where I live.  We are quite prosperous, thank you.  And I have the grandchildren to prove it! </TEXT>
