	<TEXT> I've read git isn't really the best for [binary files](https://robinwinslow.co.uk/2013/06/11/dont-ever-commit-binary-files-to-git/). If you're looking for something more for backing up your work check out [extended version history](https://www.dropbox.com/en/help/113) in dropbox. Other services like google drive might have something similar though I haven't looked. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The way I learned how to do it was by drawing curved shapes in a vector drawing program (sketch, illustrator etc) and exporting to SVG to take the code apart. 

After that I began reading the w3 spec recencyeffect posted to learn all the hidden goodies.  </TEXT>
