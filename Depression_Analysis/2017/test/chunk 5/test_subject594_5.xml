"Was it something I did?  Was it something you said...?" This barely makes sense, but I'll go with it.

"Don't leave me hanging in a city so dead..." YOU ALREADY SAID DEAD IN LINE ONE AVRIL GODDAMN IT.

"Held up so high on such a breakable thread...." Redundant.  Get out. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My current bathroom is tiny (for those of you that have ever played the Sims, it is literally four squares, meaning that your Sim couldn't use the sink).  I can't actually make it any bigger without cutting into the nursery, turning it into a closet essentially.  There is a multi-piece stall shower in it that leaks and isn't connected to the walls.  When I take a shower, it's like having water dumped on my head since it only shoots about a foot above my head.  Basically I have a bathroom from hell.  If I had 100k, I would add onto my house so I could put in an all in one-piece acrylic bathtub-shower combo, I would replace all the floorboards under my current set-up. I'd make sure my walls had cement board in them (my whole bathroom is hollow dry wall, I'm not even kidding).     </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I use tarot cards as a way of bringing my subconscious or uncomfortable thoughts into the forefront.  A lot of times we have a sneaking suspicion we know the answers to things, but we don't want to admit it so we push it down.  Tarot is a gentle prompt to confront those thoughts and examine your motives.  

Even when my cards seem to make no sense to me initially, after a minute I'm always able to apply them in some new way that forces me to use a different viewpoint.

I don't really believe in fortune telling, but I do believe they're a valuable psychological tool.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well up until that point, I'd been going to my family doctor.  At that time I weighed about 95 pounds and I'm only 4'11.5"... so my doctor would use the smallest speculum she had.  This appointment was at a Planned Parenthood a state away.  Those duckbills were fucking comparable to a damn Swingline stapler before they were even open... I'd never seen anything like them before or since.  Also, I'm not quite sure what she was doing down there, but it didn't seem to me to be business as usual.  It felt like she swabbed me (read: scratched the hell out of my cervix) at least four times.  </TEXT>

Hardy is so prone to flowery prose that I only recently got just how often he's speaking to us with his tongue in his cheek.  This novel was never a school assignment for me, but I can definitely say after four read-throughs, I get more out of it each time. :) </TEXT>

My husband had no prior experience with babies, in fact, the extent of his interaction was to hold his niece one time for about three minutes.  But he is the most wonderful father I've ever seen in real life.  He is always asking me to show him things and explain them and then he just runs with it.  He's more patient than I am, he takes photos constantly, and he brags about her to anyone who will listen despite being shy to the point of never speaking in most situations.  

The fact that you're worried just goes to show that you're going to do a wonderful job.  If you were a bad father, you wouldn't care.  Congratulations, daddy!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Copy-Paste from another comment I left, I think it applies here too: 

I used to use tricks that boys had used on me to feel me up on boys. Like you reach for something on the other side of them but drag your arm across them getting it, or you hand them something but press your knuckles against their chest when you do so, or you lose balance and grab onto them in the process. 

Invariably, they looked shocked and mortified. 

I didn't actually have any sort of conversation about this, I was just being awkward to amuse myself.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not trying to be a contrarian, but "separation of church and state" is not part of the first amendment.  It was the causation for the meeting as noted in a letter by Thomas Jefferson that resulted in the drafting of the first amendment.  The phrase never made it in, it's not nearly so explicit.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A bonsai tree is essentially tree torture.  Dwarf trees are pretty much a myth.  You just hack a normal tree half to death and then manipulate it if it survives.  If you want to learn about building a hobbit house, google "fairy gardens." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Kind of lame.  I mean, I'm sure it depends on who you're with, but my particular fwb wasn't at all invested in making things awesome for both of us, only him...Thank god I come easily.  He also seemed to think I was at risk of falling in love with him at any given time, so he went to a lot of effort to talk about his ex-girlfriend.  Seriously man, I just want to get laid, I don't need to write a book on your ex.  That's not what I'm here for.  I have no idea what the hell he was worried about, I don't know a damn thing about him save for what he studied at school and the stuff he told me about Dana.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I just want to put this out there: I'm almost 30, and I'm more intelligent than my mother, but I'm still not willing to best her in any way, shape, or form, because she was so successful in ingraining me with respect.  There have been things that she has said to me that I know in my heart aren't true, but I still grapple with because she was the one who said them.  I truly believe that your parents are the closest thing to a God you will find on this earth.  

I absolutely think at my age I should be held accountable... but prior to 23 when your brain is done maturing?  I'm not so sure about that.    </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When I graduated from high school, I immediately moved out of state.  I came back two years later and lived at home for the summer before I started college and lived on campus.  During that summer, my mom had a rule that I needed to be in by 10pm or out until after 4am.  All my friends would go to sleep by bar close, so I spent a lot of time sleeping in the back seat of my car in the driveway or going to the casino or walking around Wal-Mart.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> While you might be right technically, your contribution assumes that you want these rights.  As a married person, I can tell you that the tax differential is negligible at best.  You just need to do your paperwork.  If you have a Will and a DNR worked up, you don't need a marriage to ensure your SO is taken care of or has a say in when to pull the plug.  As for parenthood, I'm 100% sure you can find more women who want to have babies than you can men.    </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm totally confused by this question.  Like, not to be a smartass, but there is no logical reason for a non-religious man to marry in these United States.  The way I see it, it is the men who want to get married that are in demand, not the other way around.  Sex in the City confirms this suspicion.  

Confession: If I had a penis, I'd never even date exclusively.  What would be the point?  </TEXT>

I would imagine if I'd had a father (not my father, he was an addict and died when I was 12, but you know, a normal one) I wouldn't constantly be grappling with the self-doubt I got from my mom always telling me I'm wrong or that I'm confused or that I'm bringing things on myself.  I'm grateful she did, because I'm very successful and I have a strong sense of right and wrong, but I wonder what I would have been like if it had been tempered with a little of that blind faith that I'm amazing.  </TEXT>

The craziest thing isn't so crazy if someone hadn't seen us and called the 5-0, so we had to hide up there for the better part of an hour, lying down, trying not to giggle.  We used one of those round cement smoking waste things to climb up a lower overhang on a hockey shelter and from there managed to get up on the roof.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Don't panic!  You're troubles are probably 100% related to nerves.  Think about it like those couples who can't have babies.  They go to the doctor thinking there is something seriously wrong with them, but the truth is that they're both fine.  They just want to have a child so badly that their bodies are resisting due to stress.  It's probably just the same here.

You said you needed advice on what to do and what to say.  Here's what to do: practice being present.  Tonight in your room try meditating.  Sit down, close your eyes, focus on relaxing your whole body starting with your feet and moving up.  Tune out everything, all your thoughts, all the noise in your house, just feel what it is like to be in your body.  Notice everything, but focus and think about nothing.  I'm sure you've been having racing thoughts while you're with your girlfriend, the point is to practice in a low pressure place how to be in the moment.

Here's what to say: She's probably going to be hurt no matter what you say to her.  Go to the extra effort to tell her how sexy you find her and if she wants to talk about your troubles, I'd try to make it out that you're just so worried that something will go wrong you're sabotaging yourself.  

Good luck, I hope things work out better for you... just try not to worry, okay?  I'm sure there is nothing wrong with you.   </TEXT>
