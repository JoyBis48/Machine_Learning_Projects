	<TEXT> ofc there's cake, what's a birthday party without cake!?..I'm guessing it's the same except without cake but we have cake so don't worry. There's no clan though, unless you want to start one. We can call ourselves the crimson duo and stop all the bad guys in our neighbourhood. Although my neighbourhood and your neighbourhood are different neighbourhoods so one of us will have move. Unless we can convince our respected towns to change the names of the street our neighbourhoods are on to Crimson street. Then we can both fight crime in Crimson Street but none of us will have to move. but first lets have that cake...it's a crimson cake. 

 nbsp;

Hope that clears it up for you!

I hate when articles have no idea what they're writing about. Yes PC has had one more update than console has, but that's because there was a problem with the PC version that console versions didn't have. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Firstly, welcome back!! now onto the matter at hand.


Games: I don't know what type of games you like but I suggest Witcher 3 [obviously] and Dying light. With those two games you have a solid month of gaming ahead of you. Also Sunset Overdrive if you like the outlandish type of games. EA Access is also a really good idea to get, 20 a year and you have access to all the games in the vault (currently includes FIFA 15, NFL 15, NHL 15, NBA Live 15, BF4, Plants V Zombies and a few others) plus 10% discount on all EA digital purchases.


Accessories:Adapter for headset if your using a third party headset, plug and play kit **and** thumb grip for the analogues (I cannot stress enough how much better this makes the controller).


Happy gaming! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Wow. Getting downvoted because of a joke comment, lighten up assholes!!

 nbsp;

Edit: Forgot to answer your question. No I have not read the books, but that has nothing to do with what I said. I'm not arguing the fact that Geralt is an established character with a lot of history. What I'm saying is the way I play with Geralt is different. Am I not allowed to play the way I wish to play? Because I'm pretty sure that this is the reason for the game being multiple choice with many different outcomes, so that the player can play the way he/she desires. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> but that 100% thoughh!! I ended up doing it twice, both on 360 and one. You could say I have a bit of a problem. I'm glad though that this time around the nuclear waste wasn't needed for the 100%. Fuck me that took forever and with no sea life in the last gen it was the dullest hour of gaming I've had in my life, but then again 100%. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I do remember Hatorri saying some one was controlling all the base materials he needs for crafting armour. Perhaps I have to complete the sidequest and take this guy out before other blacksmiths show up. That's the only reason, apart from IGN maps being wrong, that I can think of. Still a few levels away from being able to even attempted that quest though. </TEXT>

Maybe my game has bugged out a bit?? Not sure what to think tbh. </TEXT>

My version of Geralt and you version of Geralt are veryyyy different.

Edit: To make it clear, I'm not arguing with the real history or Geralt. Thats just not how I play with him. My Geralt cuts the head off anything monster shaped (i.e All the downvoters moms). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't know if it's just me but a lot of the stuff (i.e merchants, blacksmiths, barbers etc) just do not appear on the map. Only when I'm near them do they appear and as you can imagine it's not very helpful.


Is there a map I have to pick up to update mine or what am I missing?


My map looks too bare especially Novigrad the biggest city in the game has one blacksmith showing in the whole of it, which to top off, is Hattori who is unusable unless you do his sidequest at level 20 something. </TEXT>
