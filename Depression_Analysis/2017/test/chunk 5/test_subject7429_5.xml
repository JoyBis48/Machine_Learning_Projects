	<TEXT> At the end of last year in place of the ever popular Hchste Kaiser's Word, there was a live showing of the execution of the show's news team. Before the execution, Hchste Kaiser /u/test_subject7429 explained to the people that the news team was being punished after the discovery that they were stealing classified information and supplying it to the terrorist group currently at large and killing Liechtenstein's citizens. The execution was done by pistol and carried out personally by the nation's leader. After the execution he stated that betrayal to the country in any form will not be tolerated. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Liechtenstein is doing nothing. We had no property in space. 

In other news, the terrorist cell currently attacking unarmed civilians and government buildings has begun spreading its demands across the Internet. They are calling for a stop to the construction of the Wall and reopening of the nation's borders. The group claims to be making these demands in order to stop what they foresee to be a rapid downfall in the country's economy that they fear will have a large and irreparable effect on Liechtenstein's people. The still nameless group had threatened to continue the attacks until their demands are met. Hchste Kaiser /u/test_subject7429 has yet to make a public acknowledgement to the terrorists' demands.

	<TEXT> Liechtenstein would like to send diplomats to the micro nation of Sealand to discuss annexation as a strategic base. Since its leadership has gone quiet for over a year since claiming the territory, Hchste Kaiser /u/test_subject7429 assumes that it is now open to new leadership and, because of it's size, wouldn't count as a full country in regards to annexation. 

Liechtenstein withdraws its attempted negotiations with Austria for annexation of one of its territories. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> In the last couple of months there have been three more terrorist explosive attacks. One on a military training facility and two in busy public areas. Liechtenstein's original ideas on the size of this group are either too small or the group is in much deeper than the government originally anticipated. Hchste Kaiser /u/test_subject7429 has dispatched multiple SHIT squads and even sent some private agents to various areas to investigate these attacks. 

The entire country's militarization has had little affect on the terrorist attacks as they have all been carried out by lone men and been swift and without warning. 

Hchste Kaiser has voiced his outrage at the terrorists' willingness to harm unarmed civilians and directly disrespect his own rule over the country. He has stated that he will not stop until the group's leader and all of its members are killed or captured and that he is willing to take drastic measures to do so.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> (I was busy yesterday)

Hchste Kaiser's third year as the supreme general of our great nation has been quite eventful. An attempted terrorist attack took place at the capital building while Hchste Kaiser was meeting with all of his officials. Luckily, the explosive malfunctioned and wasn't able to detonate. Turkey was able to supply intelligence that told us that this isn't a single man's idea, but a group effort. The terrorist is still being interrogated for information.

On a brighter side, our great leader recently started a new program for the military elite. The SHIT program will include the best if the best soldiers from both Liechtenstein and France. These SHIT Squads will be used as Hchste Kaiser's personal guard and in missions considered to dangerous for the average soldier or police officer. Hopefully, once the program releases the first groups from training, a terrorist attack like the one mentioned will become much more difficult to execute.

In more recent news, our wonderful leader sent delegates to the Vorarlberg region of Austria to negotiate an annexation. If Austria's own annexation of another area comes to fruition, then Vorarlberg may well become the newest addition to our great nation. These negotiations also led to an alliance between the two countries.

In other news, the construction of the Wall is going as planned, but, sadly, the **subway station's** construction has been haulted until further notice. And finally, Texas finally gave Hchste Kaiser his money back. When asked about the country's new leader, /u/test_subject7429's only response was, "Who? Oh, s***! I'm late for my banjo lessons. Get out!"

This concludes your only choice in yearly news. We thank you for choosing Hchste Kaiser's Word, even though you have no other option.

	<TEXT> This year has been a stressful one for the great leader of Liechtenstein. The panic cause by the meteorite impact in Northern Africa forced Hchste Kaiser /u/test_subject7429 to close the border to all but the most important persons and events. Despite the crisis being solved, the leader remains cautious and has yet to reopen the borders to the rest of the world.

In other news, a **subway system** began construction. Everyone is extremely excited for the **subway** and hopes to be able to **travel the country quickly and in comfort** soon. Sadly the **subway** does not yet have a definite completion date, but stay tuned! 
(*Disclaimer*: **subway system** is definitely **not** a military bunker.)

On the topic of construction, the leader of our great nation also began construction of the Great Wall of Liechtenstein. This wall will surround the entire country and be fully armed with soldiers, artillery, etc. Sadly, did to the recent change in leadership in Texas, the previously expected help in building the wall seems to no longer be the case. This unexpected delay has caused this project, too, to no longer have an expected completion date.

On a related note, Hchste Kaiser expects Texas to, "Give me my money back. Like, now, guys. I mean... Come on."

Lastly, Hchste Kaiser /u/test_subject7429 has named the raspberry as Liechtenstein's national fruit. All citizens are now required to consume at least one raspberry every 6 hours in accordance with the laws set by the recently passed Freaking Delicious Act of 2018.

This concludes your once a year news source Hchste Kaiser's Word. Tune in next year for your only choice in Liechtenstein news!

	<TEXT> Liechtenstein has begun construction of an underground **subway.** This amazing **transportation system** will run throughout the entire country and **be able to transport the citizens of Liechtenstein all over the country**! This is **in no way** a military base or a vault or anything of the sort! As a sneak peak, I am willing to say that the new **subways** will feature extremely large 3 ft thick gates that will stand around 20 ft high and be able to be withstand even the most powerful of **train collisions**! Isn't that fantastic? The **subway system** will also be going hundreds of feet below ground with multiple levels to **allow for more trains and routes**! Wow! To give you people an idea about the size, it may or may not be able to hold the majority if not all of the citizens of Liechtenstein in the event of a great **celebration** so everyone will be able to **party together**! Amazing! We anticipate that this **subway system** will be complete in a matter of 3-4 years and then **everyone** will be **allowed** to **ride the trains all over the country**!

	<TITLE> [Event] Liechtenstein begins construction of a wall around the country </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> After reports of a multitude of people secretly entering the great nation of Liechtenstein despite the heavily enforced closed border rulings, I have decided that in order to keep the peace and integrity and ensure the defense and safety of this perfect nation and its citizens, a barrier must be built. The wall will stand 50 feet tall, be heavily defended, and surround the entire nation. This decision is not one made easily, but must happen in order to ensure the safety of my nation and its people in these unpredictable times.

	<TITLE> [News] Liechtenstein's fraction of a year </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> The newest leader of the great nation of Liechtenstein began his eternal term this year rather successfully. He was able to bring the country's military strength up well over what was necessary. When questioned, the Hchste Kaiser responded, "What the hell does 'moderation' mean?" The nation's great leader was then given a dictionary and, upon reading the definition, had the reporter publicly executed.

As of now, the nation's borders are still closed due to the bacterial crisis in Africa and will only be opened for reasons of the utmost importance.

In other news, the Hchste Kaiser has said that he won't nor will he ever recognize Duck Rights.

That's all for now, but tune in next year for Hchste Kaiser's Word. You're only choice in Liechtenstein national news.
