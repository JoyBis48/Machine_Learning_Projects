	<TITLE> Songs that use old melodies? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-03-28 05:13:53 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Recently I've been listening to the Highstreet allstars and I've noticed somthing. A lot of their songs use old melodies, like their track freeze is "what do we do with a drunken sailor" 3kings is (I'm spacing right now but it sounds really familiar) and rock that beat is an old Celtic song called "son ar christr" I think it's pretty cool when artists put a spin on classic melodies. I want to find more songs, hardstyle or otherwise thanks in advance :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Post a project file and a WAV. Render, doesn't matter what DAW you use and it doesn't matter what kind of kick it is, it can be a normal distorted kick, a reverse bass, a hardcore kick heck I'd even be down for a nice gated kick. I think it would be cool to see how we all make our kicks and maybe help out those who are having trouble. I'm not at my computer right now but I'll post some files when I am :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Niiiiiiicccce, good mastering on this, I have afew criticisms (if you are the guy who made this) the reverse bass sounds like it could be a little more distorted and while I understand what you are trying to do with the vocals they sound a little boring, maybe you could get a girl friend to do the vocals and give it that aggressive human element. Besides the two things that I mentioned everything else is their, good job on this one :)

	<TEXT> Kick making :) as you can probably tell by my flair kicks are a big part of the music I make, weather it be the over driven sound of a gabber kick, the dry dusty omf of a gated kick (gated kicks are commonly used in hard trance), the aggression of a frenchcore kick, the power of a hardstyle kick or the solid thunk of a UK hardcore kick. Theirs something about synthesizing or editing one from a sample pack that is just so relaxing and fun, plus it's so cool to hear how just a little EQing can change so much about the character of a kick </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Round Wave Crusher, he has a new album coming out very soon and he's the the person that introduced me the whole
J-core scene. I know a lot of people on here don't like fast music (200 and over stuff) but seriously give him a chance, it takes awhile to get used to fast music but once you do, you will want to hear more! Believe me I know I used to absolutely despise anything over 200. Anyways here's one of my favorite songs by him, the melody is so dark and catchy, may I present to you.... [Voices (in my head)](http://youtu.be/UWaCPTgUNsk) he also did a redo of this on his Unhinged E.P.

EDIT: also You, You just blows my mind on so many levels, he makes really good happy hardcore but at the same time he can do incredibly fast music very well. He also has anime remix albums up on his site for free, check him out at [foryousounds.com](http://www.foryousounds.com) </TEXT>
