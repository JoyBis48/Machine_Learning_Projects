	<TEXT> People are charged and convicted for everything and anything, left and right. We currently have more people incarcerated in the US than any other country in human history. 

You're obviously biased. This type of reluctance to prosecute is universal in cases involving the police. In states that require a grand jury indictment, the prosecutor purposefully includes evidence that casts doubt on the guilt of the offending police. A prosecutor would never, ever, in a million years, do this in a grand jury hearing involving a nonLEO. Prosecutors rely heavily on police departments to bring charges against offenders. They're part of the same team. They're not going to hold the police accountable anymore than they'd hold themselves accountable. They already have judges, prosecutors, grand juries, and the entire system on their side with everything they do, no matter how depraved. They don't need you on this sub sucking them off.

I'm not trying to be "edgy". I'm genuinely and rightfully angry. These men recklessly killed an innocent child. If we're to have any faith in our criminal justice system or the rule of law in this county, it's imperative that they are tried and convicted.  </TEXT>

What's semi-permanent about death? 

For instance, hair dye is labeled "semi-permanent" because you can cut the dyed hair and eventually your hair will grow out as your natural color.

Maybe you should read the last line again. You seem confused.

Murder is always wrong and the government shouldn't be murdering people.

	<TEXT> Yeah but just because he was written about until after his death doesn't mean he didn't exist. 

You're not wrong, but that's still not evidence of his existence, which is what I was talking about. Personally I don't care if he existed or not being that I'm not a believer. I just don't cotton to "historical facts" which have no objective evidence supporting them. 

Pretty sure that same logic would need to be applied to genghis khan if we're being consistent.

Is this true? Did no one write about Genghis Khan while he was alive? I'm going to look that up. But undeniably there are countless cases of evidence of his existence including the DNA of his descendants. 

Edit: On second thought your claim about Genghis Khan is obviously bullshit. The man who began a campaign to conquer the world was written about extensively by enemies and allies.

There's nothing intelligent about your arguments here. This case has been discussed countless times on this sub and elsewhere. You're not adding anything by wedging your nose directly between the buttocks of the nearest police office. I don't care what you think of me or my opinion. I thought I'd already made that clear. You're defending two kid killers. You have nothing useful to say. 

How dare you insinuate that I support violence against the police or anyone else. I simply pointed out that these officers need to be appropriately punished for their crimes and as a deterrent for all other officers lest they too began to treat human life with reckless indifference. Public canings are a valid type of punishment, used in countries like Singapore and such. Doing this on a live feed who simply get the message out to everyone that killing kids is not tolerated and especially by those who hide behind the authority of a badge.

	<TEXT> Ohio is an open carry state. So it wouldn't necessarily have been illegal even if the gun was real. The police could have pulled up to the curb and used their PA to order the boy to drop the weapon and get on the gound. Instead they flew in as close as possible to surprise him and began shooting him before the car even came to a complete stop. They then refused to render aid to him as he lay gasping on the ground. They manhandled and handcuffed his younger sister and threw her in a police cruiser. 

Everything about this case is fucked. Both of the officers involved should be stripped naked and publicly flogged before being thrown in prison for the rest of their lives. They're scum for their murderous insolence. You're scum for defending them.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You charge them both for not following procedure, ignoring the law and the safety of the community, and murdering a twelve year old boy. 

Edit: I'd like to point out that 

Judge Ronald Adrine found probable cause for the charges of murder, involuntary manslaughter, reckless homicide, negligent homicide and dereliction of duty against Cleveland Officer Timothy Loehmann, one of the two officers involved in the case.

Additionally, the judge found probable cause for the charges of negligent homicide and dereliction of duty against Frank Garmback, the other officer.

So OP is at the very least, being disingenuous about there not being a legal basis for criminal charges in this case. This is one of the reasons why it favors the police to drag these things out as long as possible. People forget the facts and the narrative can be skewed in the court of public opinion.

	<TEXT> Violence always begets violence. 

I would argue that fascist policies and horrific circumstances have put religious fundamentalists, who are sometimes also rapists, in power in Afghanistan . I don't know enough about Afghanistan to form the most well rounded argument. If I had to chance a guess about the current political, social, or economic situation there, I would start with the total war that has occurred there in the last forty years or so. Then i would move on to the intermittent and half-assed efforts (if even that) at rebuilding and supporting those people you hate. This dipshittery comes from mostly people you think are superior, they were the major parties from the beginning to our current untenable situation. 

[Afghanistan] (http://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Afghanistan) has a long and beautiful history that is both multicultural and worth learning about. What has happened there is truly horrific. But, it's easy to knock a place and a people because of its current situation. 

I mean the best time to assess the United States and it's cultural developments would have been in the last third of the Civil War, right?

Edit: Since you so cowardly deleted the comment I'll ask your question again and answer it. 

OP: "I don't disagree" is vague, do you think that this ruling might have been correct? 

I do. 

I'm not a Swede. I'm not one of the Swedish caseworkers, judges, lawyers, or jurors involved in this case. I dont know this young man who was a minor child when he committed this heinous crime. I don't know his background, his medical history, or what types of horrors or abuses he was exposed to in Somalia. I don't think that you fit any of these qualifications either. But, now that you're asking me questions again, I'll repeat myself:

Why do you feel like you have the qualifications to argue about this one way or another? 

Why do you feel that this sub is the place to do it, especially when rule 2 prohibits this kind of agenda? 

You know you can go to /r/lolmorbidreality, right? I'm pretty sure that their rules would allow you to hate on anyone you like.  </TEXT>

hypocrisy

noun

the practice of claiming to have moral standards or beliefs to which one's own behavior does not conform; pretense.

synonyms:dissimulation,false virtue,cant,posturing,affectation,speciousness,empty talk,insincerity,falseness,deceit,dishonesty,mendacity,pretense,duplicity;More

	<TEXT> Fine points. I agree that education needs to be the foundation if we're going to effect any real change in the US. More needs to be done to eliminate the root causes of poverty itself, which are manifold. I know a lot of conservatives like to cite welfare programs as creating a culture of dependency, but I think that's disingenuous. 

We have for several decades, fostered a very lucrative black market for several plants and compounds that we know will always command a certain level of demand. Instead of allowing criminal individuals and organizations to profit from these markets we should decriminalize, legalize, and heavily regulate even the most illicit substances. (It's ironic that the federal government still views cannabis as one of the most dangerous compounds known to mankind) A good example of the effects of sufficient regulation and taxation would be the [trend of teen smoking] (http://www.hhs.gov/ash/oah/adolescent-health-topics/substance-abuse/tobacco/trends.html) over the last forty years or so. 

I know this may sound simplistic initially, but it can be done. And yes, I'm talking about the legalization and heavy regulation of stuff like heroin and meth. You may or may not know that in much of the country we already give addicts methadone and other analogues to heroin in very strict and supervised environments. Methadone is not demonstrably safer or less addictive than pharmaceutical heroin. Hell, methamphetamine is a prescribable medication under US law, and we prescribe Adderall and other amphetamines to children (which I do not advocate. I'm just pointing out the hypocrisy and ineffectiveness of our draconian drug laws) 

If all of these things were reasonably and inexpensively obtainable under rationally controlled and supervised conditions, it would render black markets unprofitable. In the meanwhile, we can actually address the problems by requiring counseling and offering treatment to addicts. Dismantling the drug cartels and offering a safe and controlled environment for addicts takes them out of their comfort zones. I can't imagine many people saying to themselves "I've never had it so, I'd like to go down to the clinic and try some heroin or crack". But, I'd prefer that if they felt that strongly about it, they had access to a clinic with mandatory counseling and safe conditions rather than being fodder for pimps and other types of undesirables in flop houses and whatnot. Prohibiting drugs puts drugs in the hands of criminals. I hear this argument in regards to gun legislation all of the time but rarely do I hear a rational proposition for dealing with our country's drug problems.

	<TEXT> Looking back at your comments, I'm curious as to why you chose to focus on that study while ignoring the definition of recidivism provided at the top of the page in question. 

Recidivism is one of the most fundamental concepts in criminal justice. It refers to a person's relapse into criminal behavior, often after the person receives sanctions or undergoes intervention for a previous crime. Recidivism is measured by criminal acts that resulted in rearrest, reconviction or return to prison with or without a new sentence during a three-year period following the prisoner's release.

Is it because this very relevant definition hurts your argument, and the study works as a fantastic distraction from that fact?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Who said anything about giving anyone a pass? I'm saying that it's wrong to suggest that someone is a criminal because of their religious background. Not that it's okay to assume* that everyone who is religious is a criminal or to give anyone a pass. I guess I could link to the strawman Wikipedia article here if I wanted to be a condescending jerk.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't disagree that culture is part of it. But it's difficult to tackle the problems presented by cultural backgrounds without first addressing poverty, education, and other socioeconomic factors. It's not like one can strip a person of their cultural background nor should they. There are absolutely aspects of some cultures that are harmful to women and other minorities. It's a difficult problem to address. I guess the idea is that once a person or group is appropriately educated and raised from poverty, these other issues should take care of themselves. I don't disagree that there is a certain amount of assimilation that can and should be expected from immigrants entering a country.  </TEXT>

I'm comforted by* the fact that you have no authority on* any of these topics and cannot enact your draconian will upon others. 

You didn't address the fact that here in the US, we frequently toss juvenile offenders into adult prisons where they are habitually beaten, raped and otherwise abused for much of their adult lives. I'm assuming that this fact doesn't bother you. 

Please don't talk to me about morality or what is just.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Again, you're missing the point. Without a control group, like people who received community service and probation, such research only shows part of the pictures. 

Also this study has no effect on the definition of the term. An offender doesn't have to have spent time in prison in order to be considered a repeat offender. That's just obvious.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It may not be common knowledge, but those suffering from mental illness are statistically no more likely than the general population to commit acts of violence. The truth is that* the mentally ill are several times more likely to be the victims of violent crimes like rape, robbery, physical abuse, and assault. 

I don't think anyone would argue that this crime is excused by whatever psychological issues he may be experiencing, but there's no question that such things should be considered during sentencing.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am American and I firmly believe our system is worse than backward. It's completely counterproductive and criminal in and of itself. Our penal system has a long track record of making criminals more depraved and incapable or rehabilitation. 

Sure just punishment is warranted, but you could hardly argue that throwing juveniles into adult prison to be abused, beaten, and raped to be "just punishment" without some serious cognitive dissonance. What's the point in punishing offenders in a way that denies their humanity and violates our own? It doesn't change the past, and the end result is an offender who's more fucked up psychologically and less capable of functioning and participating in society.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The duty is to all of society, not only the immediate victim. Yes prison is usually necessary in the case of rape. I wouldn't argue with that point. I will argue that's it's not your place or mine to decide what judges, juries, and lawyers should do with a juvenile offender in their own sovereign state. If Sweden prefers the focuses of their criminal justice system to be on providing aid to victims, rehabilitating offenders, and preventing recidivism  then that's their right.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If anything, recidivism rates should be higher in a system where only the most serious criminals end up in prison in the first place.


I'm not convinced that Sweden has such a system. This offender was a juvenile under their legal definition. For better or worse this is why he avoided prison time. And why would they be higher? Recidivism is about reoffending not about returning to prison.  </TEXT>

First and foremost, you're assuming that you have the knowledge, understanding, and authority to be making decisions about what should be done to this juvenile offender in a foreign country. Because he's an immigrant you're assuming that he's not a citizen. 

I don't disagree that a sexual offender deserves prison time. But I don't assume to be qualified or justified in telling a foreign sovereign state how to handle its internal affairs.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> From the way I understand it, Breivik will most likely be in prison for the rest of his life. That 21 year sentence is the "punishment" for his crimes, but the way his sentence works is that the state can choose to keep him behind bars if he's deemed to still be a threat to society. 

Edit: It's worth pointing out that Breivik and his crimes were in Norway.  </TEXT>
