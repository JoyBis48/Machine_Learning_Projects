	<TEXT> There were no wiz or witchards in Little Whinging and they had to use  means of transport that were untraceable. It still makes Nymphadora's packing spell a bit questionable.

The ministry was against Harry after the tri-wizard tourney (esp. Umbridge) so why wasn't a packing charm noted, when a hovering charm was? </TEXT>

Long story short, I picked it up, opened it in the queue, as a result I got two firm swats by the blackboard in front of the class.

The kicker was, the teacher's name was Mrs. Slaughter. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Paddy and Mick were walking along a street in London. Paddy looked in one of the shop windows and saw a sign that caught his eye. The sign read:
"Suits 5.00 each, Shirts 3.00 each, Trousers 4.50 per pair".
Paddy said to his pal "Mick look at these prices! We should buy a whole lot of those and when we get back to Ireland we could make a fortune.
Now when we go in you stay quiet, okay?
Let me do all da talking 'cause if they hear our accents, they might think we're thickos from Ireland and try to screw us. I'll put on me best English accent.
"Roight ye are Paddy, I'll keep me mouth shut, so I will. You do all da business" said Mick.
They go in and Paddy said in a posh voice "Hello my good man. I'll take 50 suits at 5.00 each, 100 shirts at 3.00 each, and 50 pairs of trousers at 4.50 each. And oyll back up me truck ready to load 'em on, so I will."
The owner of the shop said quietly "You're from Ireland, aren't you?"
"Well....... yes" said a surprised Paddy. "How did you know?"
The owner replied, This is a dry-cleaners." </TEXT>

My pointer is, he ends up insinuating Trinity so they could make a baby when he is at least eight years older, and he watched her growed up. To me, that is really creepy. </TEXT>

There was even an episode in What's New that the animators made fun of themselves in 03 with a "jumping the shark" joke, but has since come back with Mystery Inc. which was a very cool and funny modern take on the gang.

	<TEXT> Man, I was a bit of a bully myself in high school. There were only certain cliques everyone could fit into, and people did what their friends did.

But the fact is, by the time I was 18, I grew out of that bullspit and realized what life is about. I have three daughters, and the three of them are happy and they have gotten nothing but As on their report cards for two years running. (that's top marks for you Brits)

I respect James, because I see a bit of myself in him and Sirius. Someone who learned how to live properly after making a few mistakes. </TEXT>
