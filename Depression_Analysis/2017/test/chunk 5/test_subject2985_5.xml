	<TEXT> The dude took her 45% Iowa lead to 19% in 2 months, has received donations from 5 times as many people as Hillary, and can't find a venue large enough to hold all of his supporters. And yeah, she's got more money but he's running a much leaner, grass roots campaign. Really the only thing she has on him is billionaires, and with the type of campaign that he's running, that might not even be much of an issue.

Don't count him out yet. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> He's technically a "democratic socialist". It's probably more fair to say that he's a populist more than a socialist.

It's kind of nuanced, so if you want to know what he believes, this interview covers his positions really well:

	<TEXT>  He's obviously going to raise taxes like crazy to pay for these ridiculous programs - he just hasn't been pushed to admit it yet.

He "admits" it constantly. If you've ever heard him speak, he repeatedly says he's going to raise taxes on super rich to help the 99%.

His response to pretty much anything he's ever been asked is one of the following:

* We need to raise taxes on the rich.
* If you want to know Hillary's position on that, don't ask me, ask her.

The reason that the people are much more liberal than the government is that old people vote and young people don't.

	<TEXT> Welcome! Very glad to have you aboard.

Mind sharing your feelings on why you switched? I'm particularly interested to hear which issues were most significant for you, and why you feel Bernie's stance on them is a better fit for you (and America).

Thanks. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Agreed on all points. I wish Sanders would be more vocal about it, though. I wonder if he's trying to show campaign platform restraint by not running on too many things. It's the only reason I can think of why he's not speaking out for more for legalization. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's odd. Why would they go straight from 3 to 5? That'd be like making an Indiana Jones 5...

	<TEXT> I'm like 10 episodes in. I just can't stomach anymore. It stretched everything out way too long, it wasn't funny, and it wasn't Arrested Development.

If 10 of 15 episodes isn't enough to get an idea of the season, I guess I'm just missing out. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's actually very significant.

It shows that in a time when people consider politicians to be greedy and entirely self serving, Sanders hasn't used very powerful position for personal gain. By politician standards (especially by senator standards), he's downright poor.

It also shows that while most politicians are very much out of touch with the lives of ordinary people, Bernie's modest lifestyle shows that he knows exactly what the lives of his constituents are really like.

Looking at all of his extremely populist positions, it's obvious that he's for the people, but this demonstrates that he is also *of* the people. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Me too. I went digging for it after I saw that he reported $200k in income this year. I thought for sure he'd have at least a few million to his name, since he's been a senator for so long. Nope. Practically poor in politician terms.

The guy is not only for the people, he's *of* the people. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think he's got a real chance, especially because cries like this have lessened dramatically. Just a few weeks ago you'd hear "He's amazing but he'll never win!" dozens of times per day. This is only the second time that I've heard it in probably over a week.

Overcoming that was a really major hurdle, and he got past it pretty quickly. He's flying up in the polls (they look better every day), he's getting insane turnouts at his rallies, he's raising good amounts of money (from people, not corporations or SuperPACs), and most importantly, he's clearly the best person for the job.

I think we're actually going to win this thing. And by "we" I mean America. </TEXT>
