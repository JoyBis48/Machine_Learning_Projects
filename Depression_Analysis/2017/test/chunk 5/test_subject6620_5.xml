	<TEXT> I wouldn't say "spot on". It's more complex than that. He attributed the "white flight" of the 1940s to white people of the Southside feeling disenchanted with living next to black people for the simple reason that they didn't like black people. 

However, this perspective doesn't take into account that a lot of white people left the city in 1968. Things were so incredibly screwed-up that Chicago wasn't safe for many white people or black people. Mayor Daley was ordering the police to shoot rioters on site. White police treated blacks brutally. Some blacks treated whites brutally; there were people attacked on the streets because their skin was a certain color. Whites and blacks were both the victims or racism. This was the year most of my family members moved out of the city, including my grandfather who was told not to show up to work without a gun during the riots. He worked in a factory. 

These charged-up feelings have persisted for years and carried over to later generations. My dad used to deliver tires on the Southside during the 80s. He was put in a lot of dangerous situations including one where bat and club-wielding guys surrounded his truck in an alley shouting "Get the fuck out of the truck white boy." So, he went to his supervisor (who was black) and told him that he had to send a black guy on that route for his own safety. 

So it's easy to say that the "white flight" was based on arbitrary dislike for black people; for some, however, the charged-up emotions that have scarred groups of people for decades are too much to live with day to day. That isn't to say that I don't empathize with those stuck in the impoverished neighborhoods.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I found myself in a similar situation recently. I actually needed to move 700 miles back home due to the declining health of my future mother in law. I was as professional and honest as I could have been, and my administrators took note. I also offered my help in finding a highly qualified replacement candidate. 

I gave them a clear picture that this decision was based on my commitment to family. It was by no means an easy decision for me and I felt sick about it for weeks, but all three administrators showed empathy and professionalism. They have been my biggest advocates for getting back into the classroom. It is hard to feel confident about a decision like this, but as long as they saw your talents and are decent human beings it should not be an inhibitor in your career. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So, I'm going to recommend that you look at Elmwood Park or River Grove. I take it that your schedule doesn't allow you to use public transit. These towns are outside the city of Chicago, but if it is crucial that you are able to be in Maywood in 20 mins notice then you could be in Maywood in that time window. 

I'm not sure what your definition of "ghetto" is, so I'm steering you clear of the west side and Maywood. I grew up in Melrose Park and most people in the neighborhood talked about Maywood as if it were a lawless hellhole (although it is right next door and not too different than Melrose Park)

Elmwood Park/ River Grove are neighbors to the city, and if your planning to access the city by car it won't take too long. However, if you insist on living in the city of Chicago, then look at Jefferson Park or Old Irving Park. (With traffic do not assume that Maywood would be 20 mins away at any given time... or ever really)   </TEXT>
