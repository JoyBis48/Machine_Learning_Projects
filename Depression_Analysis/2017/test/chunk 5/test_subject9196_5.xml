	<TEXT> *even be possible to create a music controller on an Android watch...?*
Just use ongoing notification for such actions. I think it is a wise move as my 95% of use of sw2 is only notifications.
Also ongoing notifications (as music control) is already available in Google Music, however they didn't released it in API (in preview). 
Custom card UI will be added in final SDK version (around Google IO). </TEXT>

Apart from screen filtering there is no way to target those devices - I share your pain. Unless you want to select them manually, or programmatically at app start - but both of them are far from perfect. </TEXT>
