	<TEXT> Why? Out of respect? If so, why? I mean, it's not based on the Malaysian flight. Hollywood doesn't seem like the kind of business to really care about anything but money. In fact it's weird that they don't want to capitalize on it. Besides, this is a movie that probably wouldn't be released for another year or so. I don't disagree with their choice but it's strange.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> FCP 7. I don't know what my sequence/project settings are or the export/master file settings.

I have run into another problem though. So on this project I have put 30 hours into, I accidentally closed the sequence timeline. Now the timeline won't open for this specific project unless I create a new project and drag the sequence into this new timeline. Problem is, when I do this it makes it all one big sequence where I can't see the beginning or ending of clips. I also have to re-render everything which will take two hours.

How can I fix this mistake? Can I even fix it? I just want to edit independent clips again without having to re-edit every single thing all over again. Did I royally screw up?

Edit: Never mind about the timeline thing. Fixed it! But I do still need help exporting. How do I check the settings? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So I shot something in 1080p 24fps. I've edited it and I'm ready for exporting. The problem is no matter what I do, it ALWAYS IS TERRIBLE QUALITY!! The aspect ratio is distorted and the image is blurry/pixelated. 

I've watched so many different tutorials about exporting, all with the same result, Bad Quality. For some reason I just can't get it to work. It's so irritating. 

The worst part is that I've exported a video that came out in high quality before, but I can't get this video I just did to come out in HD at all for some reason.

Can someone please, please help?  </TEXT>

More specifically I love mountain climbing movies like Vertical Limit and A Lonely Place to Die. We rarely get movies like this though which is a bummer. 

Someone already said this one so I won't go into detail, but I absolutely love crime movies. I'll almost always pick a crime movie over any other.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I didn't mention it but you are so totally right. 

The first 300 only really used cgi for the background, blood, and the cases where that's the only option(like the army of millions of Persians and the creatures) but even then it wasn't terrible. The cgi in Rise of an Empire felt very fake and a lot of the time unnecessary.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So I'm definitely in the minority here based on the rest of these comments. 

I found this movie kind of boring. I don't know why but I never got into it at all. 

The blood looked super terrible. I think it might have been worse than the blood in the first one, which evaporated in the air. Like it was very distracting how bad it was. 

The cinematography was mediocre. You know how that show Spartacus felt like a cheap rip off of 300 when it came out? That's how this one felt, a cheap rip off. I found it very hard to tell what was going on at any time because of the either too dark lighting, or too bright and bloomy lighting. 

I feel like this isn't hardly half the movie the first one was. I was more interested in this movie when it was called Xerxes and was about his origins which was only 10 minutes of this movie. 

All in all I thought it was very poor and a disappointing sequel to one of my favorite movies. Again, I know I'm in the minority here but these are just my thoughts on it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Fall/winter I have this old Plugg jacket from 8th grade. Still fits and looks great. It's olive green and has a nice taper in the sleeves and waist. I've had it for close to 10 years. Very very durable. It's been through a lot. 

In the spring/summer it's black basketball shorts. That's what I wear *all* the time when it's hot. Not really fashionable, I know, but because they are solid black they look decent for these hot summers my city's known for.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I really love Born This Way. It was the first song of hers that I heard and really loved. Before that I had just been a casual fan who listened to her on the radio. I also love Bad Romance, Monster, and my favorite might be Dope. I love how personal and reserved it feels compared to most of her songs. 

It's hard to pick just one from Artpop because that whole album is more my style. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks! Another question, how worth it is general admission? I know this is more of a personal preference sort of thing but how much more am I going to get out of the show if I do GA vs regular seating? Is it worth waiting in line all day, to you personally? It's just that I've never done GA before. 

You also said if I showed up later, I'd get the back. How terrible is the back of GA? Last one, is there a chance that if I showed up late for GA that they'd run out of room and I wouldn't get in?

Again sorry for all the questions. You're very helpful! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So I have a question, does this mean I'd have to wait there all day to get in? Like, for example, if I get there at 8 am, do I have to wait there in line until like 8 pm or whenever it starts, to get in? Or can I chow up at 8 am, get a ticket, leave, then come back when the show starts? Also, how much are GA tickets?

Sorry for bombarding you with questions, you just seem like you know. Thanks in advance! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I choose a movie based on what my mood is at that time. Like am I in the mood for crime, action, comedy, etc. as well as sub-genre stuff like dark movies, violent, gritty, depressing, fast paced, light-hearted, etc.

A good way to find subgenres is Netflix. You can find a vast list of sub-genres or you can find a movie you've seen that is close to what you want to watch in tone and Netflix will say "This movie is: Violent, dark, etc." and will tell you what tone it is. You can then click on, let's say "dark" if I wanted to watch a dark movie, and Netflix will list all of the movies it has for instant that are categorized as dark.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I completely agree that sequels work for comic book movies. It makes sense. I'm just saying for me personally I'm not a huge fan of sequels. 

And as for comic book movies taking over original films. I guess I just meant adaptations and remakes in general. As the years go on, the number of original films are getting smaller and smaller. Everything is based on a comic or book or a remake or sequel or reboot. I can't say I blame Hollywood. If I knew a specific thing would sell, I'd make it too. 

And again, adaptations of comic books and remakes and what not wouldn't bother me if they did something interesting with them. But they all feel the same which makes me feel jaded towards them.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not really into them honestly. They aren't bad though. I really love the Nolan Batmans though because they didn't *feel* like a comic book movie, if that makes sense. When they first made an impression in like 2008 I liked them but I feel like now there is just such an over saturation of them. Honestly for me, my main problem is the fact that they are sequels and adaptations. It sounds shallow, but I'd much rather see an original film than another Marvel or DC movie. But it wasn't this way like 5 or 6 years ago because there weren't so many. We use to get super hero stuff like every two years or so. Now we get them every year. Sometimes two or more a year. 

I also don't like, and this is more a flaw with Hollywood than super hero films themselves, that producers are just looking for properties and franchises to adapt or remake simply because they know it will sell, thus creating less and less original content. These days, comic book movies are replacing original films. It used to be adaptations were made along side original films. Now it feels they are taking the place of original films. Again though, this is more a problem with Hollywood. 

I'm not totally against super hero stuff as long as they change it up or do something interesting with it. That's why I loved the Nolan Batmans. But now, every Marvel movie looks the same and every DC movie looks the same. They all look and feel the same. That combined with how frequently we see them makes them feel super dull and dry to me. 

Like 10 years ago, I'd be so pumped for the next super hero movie. Now, they just aren't special anymore. At least to me it feels that way.  </TEXT>

I think Gravity is really good, but I've always thought that best picture should be reserved for timeless films. Films that are just as great and just as powerful no matter the format, no matter the screen size. I agree that Gravity will lose a lot of its powerfulness with its transition to small screens.

	<TEXT> I watched a movie called [Three O'Clock High](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094138/?ref_=nv_sr_1). I love love *love* this movie. It's about your average high schooler, Jerry Mitchell, who finds himself challenged to fight the new guy, Buddy Revell.

Buddy is the new guy who, according to rumors, is a psychopath. He doesn't like to be touched. The last guy who touched him had his arm broken. Buddy is your typical bad boy. He wars boots, jeans, black leather jacket, and a white t-shirt. When Jerry Mitchell introduces himself, he puts his foot in his mouth and can tell he's making Buddy angry. In an attempt to fix the situation, Jerry asks if they can start over and gives Buddy a nice friendly pat on the shoulder. Psycho Buddy warns Jerry of what he's done and tells him that they are going to fight in the parking lot at 3 o'clock. Jerry then spends the movie trying to get out of it by any means possible.

This movie is exceptionally well made. The pacing, directing, and camera work are all absolutely fantastic.It's such an easy movie to watch because of how well paced it is. We constantly aware of what time it is and how much time Jerry has left. I cannot stress enough how fantastically well made this movie is. It's so much fun.

The thematic elements we see and hear throughout the film are really well done. For example, Jerry is in Biology and watching the Wonderful World of Insects. We hear the narrator describing the grasshopper who is going about his day and is preyed upon by the large crab scorpion. Another instance in English when we hear about the gladiator battles.

All in all this movie is great. If you're a fan of movies that take place in a day, this is one of the best ones. It's well made with fantastic direction and the pacing is great. It's an immensely fun movie and I highly recommend it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So just yesterday I watched [Exam](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1258197/?ref_=nv_sr_1) which is about a group of people who are all competing for a high ranking job at a top of the line company. They must decide whether to work together or alone in order to figure out the simple yest complicated test they are given that puts them to their limits.

This film is a very tight psychological mystery. It opens with eight applicants who enter a testing room. They are greeted by their test giver who gives them a few simple rules to follow. They are told there is one question and only one answer. However they must figure out what the question is as well as the answer in under 80 minutes.

We spend the movie in an almost real-time fashion watching these people trying to solve this strange mystery. It's hard to describe without spoiling it, and this is not something you want spoiled. The acting is mostly good while occasionally, but rarely, coming off as hammy. The writing is pretty tight while rarely being cheesy. The stand out in this film is the story.

This is a very interesting mystery puzzle of a story. Why are these people here? What's the job? What's the company? Why is the application process like this? What's the question? What's the answer? Over the course of the movie we watch them slowly try to solve these questions. The writers did a great job of creating this quasi-futuristic world and the conflicts it faces. Again, it's hard to talk about without spoiling.

While watching this I got two vibes from it. Cube and Reservoir Dogs. Two very different movies. 

I seriously recommend checking this out. Especially if you love a great mystery. It's on Netflix instant.     </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A few days ago I watched [The Iceman](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1491044/?ref_=nv_sr_1) in which Michael Shannon plays notorious mob hitman Richard Kuklinski.

I thought the movie was very interesting. I had never heard about Kuklinski before I saw the movie so it was all new information for me which made it that much better because I didn't know a thing. The writing was pretty good as well as the directing, but what really stands out is the acting. Michael Shannon, as always, is extremely powerful in this role. He is seriously one of the best actors working today. Shannon is joined by Winona Ryder, Chris Evans, Ray Liotta, and a surprising David Schwimmer. Everyone in the cast does a great job. The stand outs were obviously Shannon and Chris Evans, or at least for me they were. It was nice to see Schwimmer in a *very* different role than normal. However, I kind of chuckled at Ray Liotta. Not because he was bad, Liotta is solid in this. I chuckled because Ray Liotta has to be one of the most typecasted actors today. I'm sure 90 percent of his career is gangster/mob stuff. Not that I'm complaining.

It's easy to overestimate an actors performance, but this movie is great because of Shannon. Without him I think it would have been just good. 

I got a Zodiac vibe from it. Mostly because they are both period piece crime films that take place over a decade. Which brings me to the other thing that stood out to me. The costume and set design. I totally felt that I was there in the 60s and 70s.

All in all I strongly recommend checking this out if you haven't. It's seriously a great film that really shows how powerful Michael Shannon is on screen. His presence is almost God-like in its power. It's on Netflix instant so give it a watch sometime.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Dude again I never said it was a bad post or it should be removed. I like it! No, image macros suck. Mods already said that those are pushing it. It may be half gaming related but that means it's 50% irrelevant as well. My first comment was downvoted because I made an observation. Then my second comment was downvoted because I was simply saying that I did like the post but just thought it'd be better suited somewhere else. I'm not being disrespectful to anyone.  </TEXT>

Can you think of any movies like this? </TEXT>

I know when they do squibs, or blood hits, the actor wears an explosive blood pack. And wall hits are just pockets in the wall with tiny explosives. But how do they do glass? </TEXT>

Spider Man 2 had literally hours of behind the scenes stuff.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Spy films. We really only see James Bond and we only get that like once every five years or more. 

Also noir. Like good classic style noir. Nicolas Winding refn is bringing it back in a way, but there is still a lack of it.

Lastly, hard, cerebral sci-fi. Today so many sci-fi movies are all about cgi, huge explosions, and lots of action. We don't really see sci-fi that focuses more on world building and story. Her was a great step towards getting back to hard sci-fi, but we need more of it. </TEXT>

Another recent use I really loved was the use of The National's song About Today at the end of Warrior. I won't go into too much detail because I don't want to spoil this fantastic movie. But it perfectly captured that moment and broken relationship between two brothers and their father. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> But that's sort of what I'm getting at. Movies *are* a visual media but I don't think that should mean visuals should come first. I'm not saying that Gravity's visuals come first, but it sure appears that way when the visuals drown out the story. Story is important. Especially if we're talking Best Picture. It's perfectly okay for a story to be simple. But there's a difference between simple and shallow. Children of Men wasn't even nominated in any acting categories, best picture or director. I may be in the minority here, but I believe Children of Men is a league above Gravity. Best picture should be a well rounded film, which I honestly don't think Gravity is. But again that said, I still think Gravity is a technological achievement in film.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I never criticized Gravity's story. I never said it was bad, I just simply said it was similar to Avatar and American Hustle in that the story wasn't the best part.  The thing about Gravity is that it's okay to have a simple story. But it felt like the story wasn't important. You could tell that the tech was more important. When you have complex and bombastic tech and visuals, it overshadows the simple story. The story wasn't just simple, it was kind of flat. A story can be simple, but I feel it needs depth. Great stories are not determined by how complex or simple they are, but how much depth they have.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Just some thoughts on Gravity </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So when I was looking at the awards poster for Gravity that was posted on here I started thinking. I found Gravity to be one of the most technically impressive movies I've ever seen and it is an accomplishment. But I can't help but feel that it's a little over-hyped.

I find myself reminded of Avatar. Avatar is a technically impressive film of the same caliber as Gravity, I feel. Yet Avatar's plot was "meh". I feel the same about Gravity. Again, it's a technically remarkable film, but I feel that that's really all it has going for it. The acting is good and the plot is also kind of "meh".

Today, Avatar is a movie we don't think about to often, and while impressive on a big screen, it loses a lot of that impressiveness on a small, home tv. Going back to the awards poster for Gravity, one of the quotes says, "A groundbreaking film that must be seen in Imax 3D." Which is exactly like Avater. I worry that Gravity will not be as impressive on smaller screens resulting in a less powerful film because Gravity does rely a lot on its technical aspects.

I'm also reminded of American Hustle in a way. The general consensus here is that American Hustle has great acting but a "meh" plot, and a film shouldn't be considered great based on just one aspect of it. I think the same could be said for Gravity. The strongest, and really the only thing it has going for it, is its technical achievements. Now, I do realize that Gravity and American Hustle are two different beasts. And I do want to say that I'm not hating on Gravity because I think it's a really good film that has made incredible leaps in its technology. These are just observations I've made.

Edit: Just wanted to point out that Children of Men wasn't even nominated for any acting categories, best picture or director.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm Mormon and I'm late to reply, but I can decide that it's just a game. I play M rated games and watch R rated movies all the time, even though we're encouraged not to. The way I see it, it's not influencing me. I'm able to separate my life from a video game or movie. In the case of GTA V, my character murders, breaks the law, drinks, goes to the strip club, etc. This is all happening in the game, sure I'm making him do it, but it's just a game. I'm not doing these things in real life so why should it matter. Same with R rated movies. I'm just a spectator, not a participant. </TEXT>
