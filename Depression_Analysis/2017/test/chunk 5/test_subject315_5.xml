	<TEXT> So I was playing an online session and I had a pretty hefty wanted level. All of a sudden a zentorno (I think) with no driver appears out of nowhere and I am able to get in the passenger seat. It only starts moving if I actively trying to defend myself from the police using a gun from the passenger seat. And it always moves in the direction  away from the police officers and eventually I'm able to remove my wanted level...I think. I died before I was able to find out and I've never seen the ghost-getaway car again. Is this a thing?  Was I tripping? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Some of that frustration results from the fact that we feel we should be able to tell the person how to spend the money once we hand it over, like the money is still yours even though you've given it away, which is not the case. Money, once given, belongs to the recipient. You should feel happier that you made someone's day easier. And if they spend it on drugs or beer, that is their right as a human being.  </TEXT>

Poverty is a real problem that real people suffer from. You all should be ashamed of yourselves.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's a travesty nonetheless. Comparing the two and saying one "ain't so bad" is evidence of injustice and of a society run by propoganda machines. You are getting sucked into it, pal, and are becoming part of the problem. Both ways are wrong. It is wrong to even have forum for knee-jerking verdicts until this case is decided in court but America fucked that up a long, long time ago and now we breed people who have no idea what justice really is outside of what Hollywood rams down their throats.  </TEXT>
