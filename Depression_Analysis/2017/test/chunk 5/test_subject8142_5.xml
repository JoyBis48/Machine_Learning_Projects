	<TEXT> Honestly it's lack of talent. The Bulls are ridiculously deep, hence the strong regular season records, but star power wins championships. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Catholic theology at the very least has a place for the "righteous pagans". Basically that the people who were good people but were never introduced to Christianity and therefore never had the chance to be saved can still be saved in the afterlife.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In fairness though, in the 3 years under Thibs, there's been 2 losses to the Heat, which imo are understandable due to the fact that Miami is flat out more talented at the top, and one where they lost right after their star and really only major scorer was hurt. They didn't have time to learn to play without him.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Because the Bulls have been showing a tendency to take any opponent for granted for the last 2 years. They basically play every game like it's the finals. </TEXT>

I should mention I just turned 23. </TEXT>
