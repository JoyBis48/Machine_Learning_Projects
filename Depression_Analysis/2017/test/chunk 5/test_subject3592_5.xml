	<TEXT> I thought defense mechanisms were one of Freud's theories which are now regarded as useful, but not scientific.. 

EDIT: Yup. Googling reveals http://www.sparknotes.com/psychology/psych101/personality/section2.rhtml which includes the following (*Some critics argue that psychodynamic theories are not falsifiable (see pages 8-9) and therefore unscientific. In response to this criticism, proponents of psychodynamic theories point out that empirical evidence does support some psychodynamic concepts. For example, empirical research shows that there are unconscious mental processes, that people have mental representations of other people, and that people use unconscious defense mechanisms to protect themselves from unpleasant emotions such as anxiety*) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Aerodynamically it may work. The drag and lift both will increase immensely because water is a thousand times more dense than air. And the friction drag will also be much, much higer because the viscosity of water is much greater than air.

So I don't think the engine will have enough power (even if it DID work under water!) to actually propel the aircraft forward. Plus there's cavitation and other issues which arise due to the differences in fluid properties!

	<TEXT> Of course, I don't know where anything wazotea said contradicted with anything you're now saying or where you get this idea that the Butterfly effect is simple. Of course physical processes have to occur between the butterfly flapping its wings and a tornado... Chaos theory is exactly about the complexities of a highly nonlinear system! Don't really know what you mean when you say highly non-ideal. Every model has to make assumptions about behavior. That's why they're called models and not reality. 

Anyone who works in Chaos theory will tell you that is in fact, the exact opposite of convenient. It's just scientists making the best (in really amazing, creative ways) of a very bad situation in their attempts to understand nature.

I also notice you still haven't provided sources for your "Chaos has been widely regarded as wrong" statement...

EDIT: I just noticed something from your first post. You said: 

This, and what remained of your post are typical "chaos theory / butterfly effect" nonsense. There is no scientific proof of anything similar to this, it's all "mathematical" with a number of missing physical components. One such component is the compressibility of air, for example, which when perturbed on small scales, the air compresses and decompresses. With internal friction, any kinetic energy imparted to the system is dissipated as heat. Not propagated "exponentially".

In fact, if a disturbance were propagated "exponentially", it would not be chaotic. Don't know where you got that from either...

That's it. No references from you, no arguments against the article I've provided -- no replies from me from this point. Unless we meet face to face. Then we can talk over a beer :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Under actual atmospheric conditions, there is currently no way to prove that chaos / butterfly effects actually determines anything in the atmosphere. In fact, I feel confident in saying that all atmospheric motions are governed by physical processes. We may not know all of these physical processes, we certainly don't know how to simulate them accurately and precisely enough to incorporate all relevant quantities

Oh yes of course! That's exactly what it is. It's because we can't simulate them that we need mathematical theories. And it's because when simulating them, we find many surprising things that we didn't expect. Like the fact that if x is very close to 'y' at time 't', they will then stay close (at least within a certain bound that depends on how close they are) for the future. The absence of this theory is what chaos is about.

I have no idea why you think chaotic process are NOT governed by physical motions :-/ Also chaos in the atmosphere seems quite highly regarded. I also don't know why you think they are "well established as grossly incorrect". Do you have any sources for this? The above article has the following to say: *Most scientists agreed that climate has features of a chaotic system, but they did not think it was wholly unpredictable.* If that's what you're saying, I agree with you of course
Here is an article with many references that seems to regard chaos theory as an important tool: http://www.aip.org/history/climate/chaos.htm

In my head chaos theory IS a mathematical tool, not a "physical" one, though the line is pretty blurry (that's a philosophical debate). A chaotic process is just one where if x is close to y...I already said that. All of physical modeling depends on the predictability of the model. That's really all there is to it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't know much about meteorology, but I can say that wazoheat makes PERFECT sense to me. I am an aerodynamics researcher and I deal with turbulence, which has exactly the same problem. Molecular interactions have effects on large scale eddies and so on.

What you're getting confused with is probably the following: A single car may have effects on the chance of rain. That does not mean that every single car will have an effect. It means that some car starts a change, which when interacting with changes with fifty other cars and buildings and miscellaneous things (that sounds like the "Favourite Things" song!), leads to major effects. 

So overall, what is causing the big change is not JUST the car as the butterfly effect seems to imply. But without the car, the change would not have occured! 

If that makes sense to you (and I hope it does!), now it should be easy to see that unless we are able to model the car, and the fifty other things, we cannot predict the weather a month from now! Unfortunately, modeling the car is outside the scope of current computational abilities.

By a "Theoretical" limit on the models, I always understand it this way (and this was what I was taught in graduate level turbulence and numerical fluid dynamics): Since molecular interactions have effects on macroscale events, we will have to model their interactions along with macroscale interactions. Now, these interactions are unfortunately (for us), related! So, the only way to resolve this would be to model all the molecules and all the interactions!! This inability to resolve all important scales of a problem results in a limit on our capacity to model a lot of turbulent phenomena.

Like the saying goes, to model the universe accurately, you have to create another universe.

Sorry, I got carried away with turbulence, but the two are very related, it seems to me.

EDIT: You're right in your last sentence!! Sorry,  I just read that. That's exactly the problem that turbulence faces, except that in addition, it's IMPOSSIBLE to separate the temporal and spatial scales, because they're coupled through various interactions,  a subset of which is the famed Butterfly effect that you seem to despise so strongly :)

EDIT 2: Also, you're wrong about all disturbances being dissipated. First off, it's viscosity (not conservative), not compressibility (conservative) that causes the dissipation. And for many disturbances, they propagate because of instability grow very quickly before viscosity can take hold. See any textbook/online explanation of how turbulence comes about and small scale disturbances grow... There is only so much the already small viscosity of air can take care of. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Technobabble? Seriously? That friction accelerates a rolling body (in this case the wheel)? http://cnx.org/content/m14385/latest/ 

You say "This is your speculation. Not any kind of scientific fact", but you say exactly the same thing I did when you said: "This is also true, but has almost no measurable effect." In fact the difference in friction is very easily measurable. 

I stand by the scientific correctness of all that I said. I already admitted it wasn't the answer to this particular question. 

EDIT: Also, the square-cube law has to do between the relation between the weight (volume multiplied by density)and the size of an object. Did you even read the link you posted? Not the force due to gravity and the force due to drag. Drag increases with the frontal area (S), the velocity (V) and the aerodynamics (all included in the coefficient of drag C_D.. also where the square-cubed law is relevant because weight increases proportional to (size)^(3/2)). It is NOT related to the gravity in anyway except through the velocity, a relation that has nothing to do with the square-cube law. Also, the answer to this problem is independent of whether they reach terminal velocity or not.

Though really, I don't mind the downvotes. My answer was not really relevant to the question. But most of what you said really, is wrong. </TEXT>

As for the distance. Yes, that would make perfect sense. Since we have no way of judging actually how far the trails are, trails that are farther away would be (incorrectly) perceived as shorter. That's a good point! </TEXT>

**a tl;dr of the article from the article**(since I took the effort of googling and clicking on the very first result for you, I might as well do this too): 
In a now-famous paper, Stephen Jay Gould and Richard C. Lewontin emphasize that we should not immediately assume that every trait has an adaptive explanation. Just as the spandrels of St. Mark's domed cathedral in Venice are simply an architectural consequence of the meeting of a vaulted ceiling with its supporting pillars, the presence of nipples in male mammals is a genetic architectural by-product of nipples in females. So, why do men have nipples? Because females do.

	<TEXT> Momentum is the amount of "motion" in a body, while Kinetic energy is the amount of - like you said - "energy"

The immediate relation between KE and momentum comes from the simple fact that momentum is the amount of motion and Kinetic energy is exactly the amount of energy used in that motion! So yes, they are intimately related.

Intuitively, it's easy to see why the amount of motion is directly proportional to the velocity, because well, that's exactly the way motion is defined (an object moving with a certain velocity)

That brings us to why KE is proportional to the square of velocity. Let me illustrate this with an example which we'll build and then solve -- all step by step.

1/ Think of KE as the amount of work needed to bring a moving body to a standstill (Actually, that's exactly what it is).
2/ Imagine you're applying a constant force to do this (just to give you an intuition)
3/ Think of two bodies of the same mass, Body 1 moving at velocity 'v' and Body 2 moving at velocity '2v'.

4/ Since you're applying a constant force, the (-ve) acceleration of both bodies will be the same, so it will take twice the amount of time to stop Body 2 as Body 1
5/ But work is (the integral of) (Force) x (dDistance). Since Body 2 is traveling faster than Body 1, it travels more than twice the distance as body 1. And so, the work needed to stop it is more than twice the amount of work needed to stop body 1
6/ i.e. The KE of body 2 is more than twice the KE of body 1. i.e. The degree of relation with velocity is greater than 1 for sure.

How much greater, you say? That's your simple math. Integration will show you that the degree of the relation is 2. 

Intuitively, Body 2 will travel four times as far to stop as Body 1 (That should be easy to see). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The heavier will go down faster. Gravity is of course the same for both, but friction will be more for the heavier biker (Friction is a function of the normal force)

And because the friction acts in the direction opposite to relative motion, the direction is such that it accelerates the motion.

I don't think there will be too much difference, though.

	<TEXT> What bellcrank is saying is that the further away you are from the wing, the better. This is because the loading on an aircraft is almost exclusively on the wing.

So the front is the best, followed by the back (tail), followed by the wing.

However, a counterpoint to this is that you have to think about the kind of turbulence you encounter. For example, if the effect is a pitching moment about the center of pressure, then the front would be a bad place, since it would get displaced the most. A rolling moment -- the center row is best. A yawing moment -- over the wing.

Basically, turbulence is a bitch and a plane is not a bus. There is no best place.

For gaming, you need real-time rendering, where user actions will control the lighting and so frames (at least the changed parts) will need to be re-rendered.

	<TEXT> There seems to be some confusion here.

In vacuum, the terminal velocity is the speed of light, which is related to the mass, yes. That's where Einstein is king and relativity doesn't allow anything to cross the speed of light. Irrespective of your mass, the terminal velocity is 'c'.

In no-vacuum, the terminal velocity is the speed at which drag is the same as gravity, so the object cannot accelerate. Here, Newton is king and the terminal velocity is dependent on the shape (frontal area) of the object among other things.

I don't know what the Higg's field is, so if that's somehow relevant, I'm completely wrong about the first part. I'm only an aerodynamicist and confident about the second. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A disclaimer: I've never been to a therapist, and I do not have the money to go to one. 

Two years back (or maybe one and a half), I was really out of it. There was a girl, and there was work and there was my sick mother and all together, they had pushed me over some edge I didn't even know existed.

Even though they were definite causes, I slipped into some sort of meaningless sorrow, where I would be sad and/or angry for absolutely no reason. I would walk around punching trees till my hand swelled up. I would burn myself with cigarette butts. And I would have no idea why I did what I just did.

Now, I can't relate to that version of me AT ALL. Even though I still feel that deep, deep sorrow some times, and a less deep constant numbness all the time, I can't imagine at all burning myself. That pain...

Anyway, I seem to have gotten completely distracted. So, I mentioned my mother was sick, right... she died two weeks back. And it was quite bad. 

But in no way was it as bad as what I call my depression...and that scares me... </TEXT>

I hate that. Swiftkey has a gesture that you swipe to the left to delete the previous word, but I think it falsely recognizes fast typing as swiping left in some cases. 

And I keep pressing backspace instead of 'M' too, which doesn't help with my inclination to delete by mistake  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Starting Strength OHP and Power Clean alternatives </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2012-10-15 02:31:12 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hello all,

I'm starting the SS program, and because of a complete lack of interest from all my friends, I've been doing it on my own. 

The problem is that OHP and Power Clean look like very umm..."dangerous" exercises, i.e., wrong form can injure you seriously (more so than squats, deadlifts and bench presses), so I'm too apprehensive to try them alone.

In fact, I even got advice from a random cool dude in the gym about my wrong squat form, which made me even more apprehensive to try the Power Clean and the OHP...

Are there alternatives which would give similar results? 

(Ir?)relevant info: I'm a runner (5k in 17 m 30' to give an idea of pace), 180 cm, 74 kg (163 lb) and want to get strong, but not bulky (well...no interest in bulk, to be precise) </TEXT>

Of course you would take crippled and happy over depressed. I would, too!

But a crippled person could just as well say he/she would take depressed and able to play soccer instead of crippled and seemingly-happy, not knowing that depressions is just as bad for the ability to play soccer...

Now we're just arguing semantics. I know what you're trying to say, and it's cool :) </TEXT>

Even now in the US, I can't help but feel jealous admiration when I see high school events with better facilities, more encouragement from the community and just as much love for the sport than at the national level in India. It's crazy and it's awesome.

	<TITLE> Tips for running looong distances </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2012-10-02 00:21:45 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hello /r/running, this is my first post here... but I've been running a while. I was on my college athletics squad back in India for long distance (well 5000 m track), and then stopped running completely and started again about 4 months back because I read **Born to Run**

Corny as that sounds, I was really inspired by how over-the-top enthusiastic the author was. I'm not really into equipment (including the vibram shoes) or into timing my runs. I just really like running. I've never run a marathon and I never intend to do it.

That should tell you something about the kind of runner I am. I just like to run...that's about it. I run for varying amounts of time, speed and distance (5 to 13 miles at 7:30 to 10:00 per mile) depending more on my mood than anything else.

But I do love trail running and I really want to get to the point where I can do the Zion National Traverse in a day. That's 48 miles. 

My question (sorry for all the irrelevant information, but I like talking about this stuff) is how do I get from a relaxed 13 miles to a relaxed 48 miles? 

I ran the 13 miles in two hours and wasn't really tired at the end (but my legs were sore, probably because I haven't run in a while), if that helps with judging my running ability... </TEXT>

Then it hit me, what if they're only counting the weights on one side?! 

So, is that the way it's done and I've been entering double the weights I squatted on my first two attempts into my diary? (all of 70 lbs, both sides included!) </TEXT>
