	<TEXT> Yes, 100%. My depression was based on not knowing how to communicate, cope, express myself, because of my upbringing. And other things of course (genetics, imbalance). But yes, that's why I started to use. Some others here may say they didn't start because of this, but continued to use because of depression. Slippery slope. Fuck depression.

Edit: opiates have been 10x better for my depression than SSRIs/SNRIs. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, it affects every single aspect of my life. It'd take me a day to write it out and there are multiple people that have already written articles/blogs on their own experiences. 

What are the biggest things for me (at the moment) have been school. I can't concentrate, I don't care about getting good grades, I don't go to class b/c I can't get out of bed, I feel sick when I get a bad grade or don't know something, I feel alone in the classroom, or i won't be able to complete a class so then i start thinking about my future and how i won't graduate because i can't complete the coursework, so i won't get a job, won't get a house, be broke, no one will want to marry me, can't provide for family, friends hate me, etc, the list goes and on and on it goes.

Then there's work. I can't get out of bed or bathe, so fuck it, I'll call in. Then I'll realize I should just quit because my brain says I'm useless. Hard to remain interested in a job or give a fuck or no get angry at the littlest things. then you start worrying about money without a job and then the wild thoughts run through your head like stated above.

And then socially - I feel like laying in bed all day, in pjs, unshowered. I don't want to talk to anyone. I see people doing things, having fun, excelling at work, and it makes me feel bad about myself. I think I'm useless or boring or a pain for others, a burden, etc.

This was based on depression, but there's also problems with anxiety and mania that are pretty much the same things. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> THERE WILL NEVER BE ONE.

Seriously, I was you 6 months ago. Taking opiates because it was the only thing that worked. Some people get depressed and suicidal because of the pills, I was depressed and took the pills to stop the depression. It got out of control and I had to stop. Now I'm on antidepressants that barely help. They suck. Opiates are much better but I'm constantly debating if it's worth the risk. 

Kratom is legal and similar to opiates for me, in terms of motivation and interest. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Depends. I mean, I don't eat meat so if someone asks for a recommendation like that, I usually state what others have told me and the reputation. I used to work at a juice bar, and when it wasn't ferociously busy, 90% of the time I had an in depth conversation, explaining everything, giving them recommendations. That was my favorite part of my job!

At the end of the day, though, we all have different tastes. I could like one restaurants type of sauce, and you may hate it, but we both like spaghetti sauce. So, it's hard. But to answer your question directly, no, it's not annoying to me AT ALL. I love it. I think a lot of bartenders are like this too!

I'm sure some people hate it, however, and these people are probably those that hate their job, menu, or products. </TEXT>

Trim up decently. Make sure you're clean. Then start kissing her. Eventually feel and caress her then fuck her. Also, if you get off quick and then button up, you will be a dick if she got no enjoyment out of it. If you care about her, you'd get her off too.
