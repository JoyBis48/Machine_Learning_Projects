	<TITLE> [TOMT] Two websites. One was a videogame cheats website, the other was a Where's Wally screamer. Details inside. </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Videogame website: It was a website for videogame cheats, popular in the early 2000s. One of my main alternatives to GameFAQs. It had a yellow layout at the time and I strongly believe had "cheats" in its title.

Where's Wally: I've seen mirrors of this screamer since then, however I'm specifically looking for a webpage/site that hosted this and ALSO had a hatemail section where people sent in their grievances after having been tricked by the screamer.

Thanks. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Back then, an obese lady/man was considered attractive, not because of reproduction instinct, but because it represented wealth and status.

This is outright contentious, there is no academic consensus. Yes, fat people might have been more SOUGHT after. This does not make them more ATTRACTIVE. A supermodel hanging off the arms of an 80 year old billionaire, with 50 other girls after him, isn't necessarily more sexually appealing than a normal, young guy with just five girls after him. They could be willfully overlooking how repulsive he is for the money.

I guess this comes down to the definition of attractive, but I believe we're talking physical here.

Also, as specific traits become less correlated with wealth/power (fat people and skinny people are in all classes), these things matter less. I wonder if we care more about our 'primal' attractions now than for most of recorded history. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> and the fat chicks were the supermodels.

This is highly overstated and only arguably true for some societies in very small periods of time. More importantly though, it's the result of the implications of their fat. Fat = wealth.  It's hard to even argue that it's attraction (more like fat people being more desirable for their wealth, while their suitors pretended to find them attractive to get in good with them). There's a lot of debate around this among historians.

More on point though, as society grows and everyone has access to the same food and exercise choices, the same medicine and the quality of life increases across the board, it might become more normal to play of our basic instincts of attraction rather than societal standards. If most mind find large eyes on women attractive because of a natural response, then it's unlikely to see that disappear without some highly unpredictable shaking up of social order. 

1,000 years is a long time, but if the quality of life keeps improving and physical attributes continue to correlate less strongly with wealth/power, it's hard to see that happening. </TEXT>

For example, if I'm suing someone for damaging my car for $10,000, will I sue for $14,000 to cover lawyers fees, or do I pretty much have to accept that the moment damage is done to my car that I'm at best getting 60% of it back?

	<TEXT> Struggled with anxiety all through my teens and early 20s. I'm 24 and graduating midsemester. I've improved dramatically (only get specific anxiety trigger now, rather than the constant feeling of dread and unwillingness to leave my house). 

However, one thing I haven't had much area improving on is formal/professional interaction. I feel I may be a bit too laid back, and what few attempts I've had to interact professionally have always been a bit awkward (not knowing when to shake someone's hand, or wrap up a conversation, my voice gets really weak and quiet randomly in conversation's I'm not comfortable with, not good at saying stuff like "nice to meet you" because I just throw it out in random places for some reason).

I know it's weird, but I just go from 'fake it til you make it' mode that I put on in casual meeting to 'complete awkward mode' once a level of formality is introduced. Probably a fear of being judged?

Anyway, the important question: how do I get over this bump? I feel like it's my last step towards feeling good about my future. </TEXT>

My main issue with this is the fact that if it were so cheap, why doesn't a competitor just slash 5k off his car and get all the market share. Eventually other businesses would react and cars would be cheap. Product differentiation only answers part of the story, there would surely be huge markets for cheap high quality cars.

Is it possible whoever told you this failed to factor in marketing, administration, sales %, salaries, R D, etc?

	<TEXT> So let me get this straight: you're suggesting that Moriarty, at the climax of his plan, among all the emotion and tension in the air, just suddenly goes "wait a minute, I want out lol".

And on top of that, Sherlock just willfully let's the criminal who is about to kill his friends go, despite already having a plan to fake his death that would save his friends anyway (ie. he doesn't need to co-operate with Moriarty in the first place. There is no reason for it).

I really believe Moriarty just straight up faked his death and pulled the wool over everyone's eyes the same way Sherlock did. I would not be surprised if Moffat pulls the same stunt of not explaining how he did it either. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Correlation =/= causation, you're right. However you're being retarded if you think you can use that claim to dismiss basic reasoning. There is no definite word on why he left Twitter because Joss hasn't spoken up. And even if he did, he could very well lie in order to keep things 'cool'.

What we can do it speculate, weigh the evidence and form conclusions. It seems like he left Twitter precisely because of the backlash.

You could post that stupid picture in response to any number of commonly held beliefs about historical events or figures too, by the way. They're often based on finding evidence based on the timing of events (eg. seeing the rise of iron coinciding with the fall of the Minoan civilization has linked the two, even with no direct evidence). A smart person does not fall for the correlation = causation fallacy. A smart person also doesn't use correlation =/= causation to dismiss evidence and reasoning.

But this is all greatly overanalysing. We're talking about a man quitting Twitter. Around the time he was getting attacked, over a subject he has expressed great personal belief over. It's not a leap to conclude that those two events are linked. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is why we have boxing gloves.

If you're suggesting that boxes gloves aren't designed with damage the face in mind, I think you'll find you're wrong. What that common TIL often leaves out is that the gloves distribute the blow of the punch more evenly, leading to less facial damage than if the gloves were smaller. It's part of the design to not damage the face too much while also enabling you to hit the face in the first place. </TEXT>
