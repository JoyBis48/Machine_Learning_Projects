	<TEXT> I see what you're saying, absolutely. I just view it as a telescoping serialization, rather than the end of serialization. Although I buy your argument. 

As a whole, you could look at the increasing popularity of series of novels as the next step in serialization. Where before we split up the same (long) book into parts, now we break up the same long series into novels.

In terms of a serialized novel, it'd have to be long enough to support the serialization, but I could imagine a scenario in which it works. I could definitely imagine something like the next Song of Ice and Fire book being serialized to great acclaim, if GRRM decided he wanted to (which there's no way in hell he will). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I disagree that Netflix and Hulu means the end of serialization. I'd argue the exact opposite. Netflix IS the new serialization. Look at how they release all their original content: a season at a time. Which people watch in rapid succession and then wait eagerly for the next one.

That's serialization. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think it was a risk we needed to take. This was Howie's last year under contract, and we'd made it clear that we weren't going to resign him. Heaney, on the other hand, is a high-ceiling starting pitching prospect, which is by far the weakest position in the organization. He broke camp in AAA, but he will be in the majors before too long if he keeps progressing. We just have options in the rotation for the first time in a long time, which is awesome for us.

Howie was a fan favorite, and it sucked to see him go, but Heaney has a chance to be a key rotation cog for years. With Weaver and Wilson starting to be on the way out, Heaney will get a shot. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I wish I knew. We've had some terrible BABIP and RISP luck, but the offense will come around. But the middle of our bullpen has been awful, and our rotation has been very, very meh. We just got back Richards from his knee injury, so hopefully he can adjust and settle in. Shoemaker had his first bad start in forever on Monday, and now he's on the bereavement list. Wilson has shown flashes of pretty good and really bad. Weaver had his first solid outing of the year last night, but the bullpen took it and set it on fire.

Basically, I think we'll be fine if we can get the pen sorted out. We have most of what was a really good bullpen last year, and I think our rotation can surprise people. Just not clicking yet. We tend to do this in April. Last year was our best April in awhile, and we finished the month at .500. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Their salaries are very much lower than what rookies make in other leagues, but with the bonuses, the money is there, and for a larger pool of players than in the other sports. Good on you for waiting to research to respond though, there's always things that we don't know and that's a good look.

The Harris poll methodology is a good representation of the current state of affairs, but no one under age 30 was polled. Where the NBA is making big gains is in the younger demographics. Those will take awhile to show up throughout the rest of the population, but in terms of predictors of future success, being popular with the under-30 demographic is a pretty strong one.

And the Bleacher Report thing doesn't have anything that shows a decline in popularity. It's just a think piece about what that dude thinks is wrong with today's NBA. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well let's pick apart just a couple of the things you said wrong.

Baseball is the only professional sport in America where you can make millions of dollars directly out of high school. High school kids get drafted in the top of the first round and sign for multimillion dollar bonuses often. Of the first 74 players picked last year, 2 didn't sign (including the number 1 overall pick, cuz he turned down a $5 million bonus after it was reduced from $6.5 million as a result of his physical); so out of the 72 that did, only 9 did not receive a 7 figure bonus. And the lowest of the bonuses was $546,100. So it's actually the quickest "get rich quick sport".

NBA popularity has not fallen off the table; it's rapidly rising in popularity. I really have no idea where you're drawing that conclusion from. Baseball is still more popular, but the NBA is coming.

	<TEXT> That commitment is conditional; the consequences of breaking that commitment are that he doesn't get a scholarship to attend Buffalo and play basketball there anymore. That's it. That's all. End of story. 

Lol that's a false comparison. Evans is doing nothing that many other players whose coaches left are doing. I agree that he hasn't necessarily handled it the best by tweeting about it, but no one in this situation has.

The precedent in this extremely-precedented situation is to block conference opponents and out-of-conference rivals, if any. That is the de-facto reasonable limitation, as determined by **the rest of the country**. By blocking more than that, you are being unreasonable, by definition. Especially considering the schools you blocked are his best options, and the places he is most likely to transfer to: where the coach he considers a father figure now works, and the two schools closest to his home.

I'd have preferred if Hurley stayed at Buffalo; I was excited to see what you guys could do with him going forward. But it happened, and acting like this in the aftermath is childish.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I stand corrected in saying that he was there because of Hurley. However, Hurley did coach the two seasons he played for you, and he has referred to him publicly as a father figure.

Just because the rules allow you to do it doesn't mean it's fair at all. I'm having a hard time grasping the idea that someone actually believes that because the NCAA says it's okay, there's obviously nothing wrong with it.

He implied that, but until he has some evidence, that's all he's doing.

I know, I'm glad they lifted the blocks. Cuz it's inane to think that you should be able to control someone else's life in this manner. Sadly, the only reason they lifted the blocks is because they realized how bad it looks, not because they actually feel they were in the wrong. </TEXT>

Evans gets to decide what's best for him, not you. You do not control him, and it's petty, immature, and flat out wrong to try and block him from pursuing what he feels is his next best step. Chances are, he was only at Buffalo because of Hurley anyway. So when he leaves, you just get to control him? Bullshit. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No. This was already a silly situation before that happened. Lawrie was out of line, made a dangerous slide, and got beaned for it. It happens, Lawrie was fine with it, tried to apologize for it (but did or didn't depending on who you believe). It should've been done there.

It's making a big deal out of Cain getting hit in the foot that started the merry go round again. 

I get that you guys are angry about getting hit by so many pitches, but it's really, really not about you. There seems to be this weird narrative that everyone is beaning you because they don't respect you. That's just not true. There is no concerted effort by the rest of the league to bean your team.

I'm not saying you can't be angry; you should be frustrated. It's been terrible luck. But y'all need to realize that no one cares if you feel disrespected, 'cause that's something that's entirely in your own heads. What people do care about, though, is throwing high-90s fastballs behind people's heads. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I found a lot of really interesting parallels between *On The Road* and *Fight Club*, which I know sounds like the most obnoxious combo of all time to a lot of you. I'd read both before, was revisiting, and in conversation with each other you can pick up on a lot of subtext that tends to fly below the radar. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Seriously, I do this all the time.

Best find would have to be Kenzaburo Oe *Teach Us To Outgrow Our Madness* because I'd never have expected to be able to find that book anywhere in San Diego, let alone at the Goodwill.

Either that, or the time I found an Environmental Ethics textbook I'd used in one of my courses a couple years back, bought for a dollar, then took to the campus bookstore and resold for 30 haha. </TEXT>
