	<TEXT> As in bytes. I know very little about rendering environments in games, but I figured they can only load a certain amount of information before the game starts to drop in frame rate, lag, etc. If I downloaded information through my eyes in a similar way, how much information would I be downloading, in terabytes or however great the number might be? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> I'm worried about getting fired sooner or later because of religious reasons. What exactly is the law on that? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> **TL;DR:** My new employers are Christians running a business completely unaffiliated with religion. Asked me religious questions in interview. Don't necessarily share beliefs. Can they legally do anything about it?


I live in Kansas if that matters (law-wise). I was recently hired to work at a business that sells car tires. It's not a church, it's not spreading the word of God, but they're obviously Christian owned (paper on the door asks people to not swear, then follows with Bible verses).

Anyway, when I was in my pretty laid-back you-already-got-the-job kind of interview for this particular business, I was asked if I was sleeping with my girlfriend or had any illegitimate children running around. As a redditor, I don't know what a girl is, so I said no. He then follows by saying, "You don't have to be a Christian to work at HerpDerp Tires Co., but we do have prayer time in our meetings. You can participate if you want." I'm like, okay, fine, that's your thing. I'm just worried they might find some reason to fire me if I disagree religiously.

Also, while I do believe in God and was raised Southern Baptist Christian, I can guarantee I don't share my beliefs with these people. I need a job though or I can't afford my rent, and this was a great opportunity. Am I safe, or is there some legal reason that they might be able to fire me in the future? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Dead Island surely scares me. I close my eyes every time I climb ladders with zombies following close behind. Haha.

Is the game fun enough to buy? I know $5 isn't much, but I don't want to waste it if it's not worth it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Had not thought of that. I took a Geology 300 class last year, and vaguely remember how little we have. We were taught that we have enough to sustain our existence, but it just gets more and more difficult to get to, even though technology gets more and more advanced. This surely would cause a great problem for us if we couldn't find a way to harness the sun/wind/water more efficiently right off the bat. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's also true. I didn't really define either. Assuming all was completely annihilated somehow but everyone didn't die in the process, then we would be stuck at square one. However, if everything is just wrecked from bombs or some other WW3 type destruction, then we would have the rubble to use to rebuild. We would have to separate each element in the rubble, which would also take technology though. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Is this a game I should buy? I'm terrified of zombies, but I kill them to help lessen my fear. I play Dead Island with two of my friends on PS3, and if this is a game you guys think I should buy then I'll convince them to get it too. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That was my assumption. I was also curious as to how small the layers would get as we reach similar levels to where we are now. Like for instance, we use computers to run machines that build computers. Rebuilding the computers without the machines, in order to run the machines, would be another layer we probably couldn't circumvent. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is related to my post a few hours ago. My friend found a gray cat with white socks with no collar unfortunately. It was found off of Highway 50 near the Coneburg in Peabody, KS. If anyone knows anything about it, the girl who found it would be thankful to give it back since she had her cat picked up the same way a few months ago and never got it back. She is sad that someone can't find their cat, assuming it belongs to someone. Thanks if anyone can help. </TEXT>
