	<TEXT> Actually, according to Marx, socialism is the step before communism. Marx envisioned a continuum that begins with agrarianism, then to Capitalism, then socialism (by means of Progressivism) and finally Communism.

Your analogy is incorrect. Fascism is a form of socialism. The Nazis were the National Socialist Worker's Party. Hitler was a socialist leader and writer as was Mussolini.   

Any positive accomplishments by Progressives such as child labor laws and worker safety are commendable but that does not change the fact that the ultimate goal of Progessivism is not "what ever works" but a rigid path towards ideological socialism. 

Please read this link that explains Progressivism. The link is thinkprogress.com so you can't say it's biased against the Left.

	<TEXT> But are we forgetting the part where he was a Progressive? Conservative means something. So does Progressive. They don't mean the same thing.

Progressive does not mean a general desire to make things better and improve people's lives. Progressivism is a rigid, ideological path to socialism. Dissent is strictly forbidden. Even in TR's time, Progessivism was a rejection of American individualism and personal freedom and the embrace of big government involvement in every aspect of people's lives.

But can you refute the data the link provided as being false? It linked to a demographic study of the shift of the Southern Democrat voters to the GOP. Can you refute that study? 

Am I a liberal? No, i am a republican that is embarrassed that the Tea Party exists.

 I looked at your commenting history. You support Elizabeth Warren. You are simply being deceitful here. Why can't you admit your political beliefs? Are you embarrassed to be a Liberal? Or are you only interested in dishonest demonization of the Tea Party as racists?

The Tea Party is a reaction to  big government, big taxing, big spending politicians of BOTH parties. The Tea Party did not exist when Regan or Bush were president.    </TEXT>

"The Tea Party opposes big government period. Race has nothing to do with it" Then why did it not appear during Bush years, and appeared right after we elected a black president?

The Tea Party began as a reaction to big government spending. The Bush administration stoked the fire and the Obama administration caused the fire to explode. Obama's policies such as the ACA and deficit spending of 1 trillion dollars per year were the fuel. His race had nothing whatsoever to do with the rise of the Tea Party. If Hillary or Liz Warren become president you will see just as loud opposition to their policies.  </TEXT>

http://www.redstate.com/2012/07/11/the-southern-strategy-myth-and-the-lost-majority/

Why did they not have a problem until a black man became president? and not when George Bush increased federal debt/ spending a shit ton? Or when Reagan did also? Or when ANY FUCKING republican president did it? 

The Tea Party began as a grass roots reaction to free spending politicians of every party Bush, McCain, Obama etc included. The Tea Party opposes big government period. Race has nothing to do with it. If Hillary, or Liz Warren, or Bernie Sanders becomes president, the Tea Party will be just as opposed to their Leftist big government policies. If a big spending Republican like Jeb Bush became president, the Tea Party would oppose him too. 

Edit: Have you EVER taken American History? Your knowledge is lacking severely.

	<TEXT> No none denies that racists are a small percentage of all political parties. The Democrats refuted racism and everyone applauds them for it. I just don't see the logic of the conclusion that just because the Democrats refuted a position that the opposition must then embrace that position. Isn't it possible that both parties now don't support racism? We can trade examples of racist behavior by random members of both parties but that does not prove that such an attitude is indicative of how each party feels about racism. 

The claim of GOP racism by the Left is a tactic to stop debate on issues. If those people who don't care about politics and who get their political information from watching Jon Stewart on Comedy Central can be lied to and convinced that the GOP is racist then those voters will never vote Republican regardless of the issue. </TEXT>

They created the KKK, poll taxes, segregation, Jim Crow etc. It was only after the Civil Rights act passed (by members of both parties) that the Democrat Party finally shed the last vestiges of overt racism as an official policy. 

The point of the article was the false claim that the GOP switched with the Democrats and embraced racism.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This has to be the most unscholarly article I have read in a long time. The author writes that the two parties flipped during the 60s through the 80s with the racists Democrats renouncing racism and the GOP embracing it. 

It is true that the Democrats moved to the Left and renounced their long history of overt racism after the Civil Rights Act was passed. It is not true that the GOP in response decided to embrace racism are a policy. The entire article is based on an interview of Lee Atwater nearly 50 years ago. In that interview, Atwater laid out the so called Southern strategy that the author claims proves the racism of the GOP.

First of all, an interview by a political consultant 50 years ago does not speak for the millions of GOP voters  of today.

Secondly, the migration of the Dixiecrat voters from the Democrat Party to the GOP was a gradual transformation that occurred over the course of 40 years. There was no sudden switch in racism from Democrats to GOP.

Thirdly, what Atwater stated is often misunderstood. He was saying that appeals to racism were not necessary as economic issues were far more effective in attracting disaffected Southern Democrats who had soured on the Democrat Party's move to the Left politically.

Fourthly, no party would embrace a  policy such as racism that would attract an insignificant portion of the voting public while at the same time offending the vast majority of the voting public. It simply makes no logical sense. 

Finally, the Tea Party stands for three ideas:  Lower taxation, less regulation, and smaller government. Race, gender, sexual identity, religion have nothing whatsoever to do with the Tea Party. Nothing whatsoever. The Left lies about the Tea Party to demonize it so that debate on the ideas never takes place. The Left lies in order to squelch any discussions. </TEXT>

As the song says "Two men say they're Jesus, one of them must be wrong"

The bottom line here is that Ted Cruz and the Right base their climate change suspicions based on data. We may be wrong but we are sincere and being scientific. 

Shouldn't this issue be determined using the scientific method of experimentation and reproducible results? Politics has polluted the issue and thus actual facts are often difficult to find.

How could you be against continued experimentation? Certainly scientists do not understand climate science to the point that we can simply stop exploring.

	<TEXT> Yes you are a Liberal because you are incapable of debating without insulting your opponent. 

Liberalism is an unwavering ideology. Those that adhere to it follow that ideology religiously. Being a Liberal is central to the debate on climate change. Why? Because the solutions proposed by Liberals involves raising taxes, increasing regulations, and empowering elites. These solutions are extremely expensive and promise very little in the lowering of temperatures if successful and do not guarantee any results at all.  

I get my data from here http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/temp-and-precip/msu/ (UAH MSU)

Here is the key data graph: http://blogs-images.forbes.com/warrenmeyer/files/2012/02/15yr-temps.gif

As you can see, the temps have remained statistically flat. This is in direct conflict with all of the models you cite.

Bottom line: if models conflict with actual data then the models are wrong. Period

No. Why is it that those on the Left can't fathom the fact that people can have differing views without being insincere or being trolls and racists?

i'm not sure what you mean by this question. focus less on what the temperature should be and more on what the side effects are if the temperature reaches certain points.

No the average temps historically are important because they show that temps have varied greatly up and down over the past 100,000 years. This is also true for CO2 levels. What that means is that it is normal for the earth's temps and CO2 levels to very with or without anthropogenic influences.

If we disregard those facts and focus only on possible side effects then we fail as scientists. Using your logic, we should encase the entire country in a steel shield to protect us from meteorites

	<TEXT> The point is that throughout earth's history, CO2 levels and average temps have gone up and down. In light of that indisputable fact, a temperature increase of .7 degrees over a century is statistically and scientifically insignificant. 

Volcanoes produce massive amounts of CO2. They should be increasing temps according to the climate alarmists not lower temps.

Can you name any climate model that predicted increase in temps that is correct? The fact is that no model has matched actually observed temps.

Conservatives doubt climate change harmful claims because:

1. Climate science has become polluted by Leftist politics

2. Climate models have been totally wrong.

3. There is no such concept as scientific consensus in the study of any scientific field and claiming a consensus runs contrary to the scientific method.

4. The proposed solutions to climate change are to raise taxes, increase needless regulation, and empower elites. The solutions will be very very expensive and the results are not guaranteed or likely to reduce temps by any appreciable amount.

	<TEXT> Dear RedditPope, 

I apologize for my response to the other user. If you look at the comment thread between us, you can see that the other commenter was trolling me first. His trolling tactic (which is often used in Reddit political discussions) was to engage in an insincere political "debate". His goal was to ask for proof and citations for my positions. When I provided them he would ask for more, When I provided those, he would ask for still more. His goal was not to engage in a meaningful, honest political debate. His goal was to trick me into doing meaningless research and wasting my time so that he could mock me and my views. 

He was in fact the troll in this encounter. My response was simply calling him out on his trolling tactics. 

Thank you.   </TEXT>

The bottom line is that I could literally, LITERALLY provide you with a video of Obama stating that he is a socialist and that he intends to destroy America and you would make up some excuse for him and still think he was the greatest president ever. 

 Can we at least agree that Obama lied about Obamacare? His comments are on video. Can we at least agree on that? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's not. The EPA was established in the 70's and they did fine work then. Today the EPA is polluted by Leftist political goals of destroying American business, raising taxes, increasing needless regulations and empowering elites.

You state the typical Liberal fallacy that if one is opposed to any part of anything they are against everything. I am against the EPA abusing their power and destroying whole industries for the sake of their twisted ideology, Everyone is for clean water and air. 

Socialism stands for control. Control over the people by self declared elites who think the people are dumb and need to be led like children.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You must realize that Progresivism is not a general improvement of things, society, and the condition of the people. "Progressivism" and the policies of the Left are nothing but a rigid ideology based path towards socialism. Dissent is not allowed. Expressing contrary opinions is not allowed. Anyone who opposes the Left is evil in their eyes. The Left, AKA Progressives, Democrats, Liberals want to fundamentally change America from a Jeffersonian representative democracy into a socialist system where self appointed elites boss the common people around and compel them via intimidation and force to comply with their ideas of what a perfect society will look like.

The GOP (Grand Old Party) AKA Republicans is made up of various factions. 

1. Establishment Republicans (sometimes called RINOs- Republicans In Name Only)  are old school Republicans who favor big government, immigration amnesty, and are DC insiders.

2. Tea Party Conservatives are interested in smaller government, less taxes , and less regulation, They look to the founding fathers and the Constitution for guidance in making policy. The Left often demonize the Tea Party as being racist but no evidence whatsoever has ever been produced by the left to back that false claim up. The Tea Party just wants less government interference in the people's lives. Race has absolutely nothing to do with that.

3. Libertarians believe that the government should not be involved in anything except  a very few services. They favor no drug laws, no taxes, and they want the freedom to live their lives without government interference. 

I encourage you to watch Bill Whittle's Firewall series on Youtube for a great primer on politics in the US.  https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=bill+whittle+firewall

	<TEXT> The GOP is made up of several factions including the Tea Party and Establishment Republicans. Establishment Republicans support immigration reform aka the Dream Act etc. The Tea Party and other Conservatives support immigration reform only if the borders are secured first. Obama has refused to do this.

Tea Party Conservatives are against currently proposed immigration reforms because;

1. Obama refuses to close the borders.

2. Obama refuses to enforce current immigration laws.

3. Obama has unilaterally causes hundreds of thousands of new immigrants to illegally come here from Central America and Mexico.

4. Past promises of sealing the borders and enforcing current immigration laws have been ignored by the Democrats. Remember the immigration reform act passed by Reagan?

5. Obama and the Democrats want open borders and huge increases in illegal immigration so that any reform law would immediately allows millions of new voters to change the result of elections for decades. 

The race of Obama has nothing, nothing whatsoever to do with the GOP opposition to so called immigration reform.

Can you provide any proof that the GOP is in any way more racist than the Democrats or any other large group of Americans? </TEXT>

Sorry but simply because you believe it does not make it true. Can you offer any policy statements, candidates' positions, voter outreach, advertising, or anything else to back up your claim that the GOP is racist or embraces racism as a policy. 

Please realize that simply because we Conservatives are opposed to the policies of Mr Obama that does not equate with being racist. We Conservatives oppose any Leftist policy regardless of the race, sex, religion of who proposes it. 

BTW the Nazis were socialists so your knowledge of politics seems to be a little suspect.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Again, Nixon offered an opinion 50 years ago that unhappy racist Democratic voters would shy away from the Democrat party and vote GOP. That's it. Nowhere does he say that the GOP should become racist, offer racist candidates, or racist policies. 

The migration of the Dixiecrat voters from the Democrats to the GOP occurred over a 40 year period. During that period it is safe to say that the percentage of any voters for whom racism is a deciding factor in who to vote for has fallen sharply. In fact that percentage of voters is probably insignificant at this point. 

No party would embrace racism because the rewards would be miniscule while the harm created would be vast.

The Left demonizes the Right with this false claim for one reason: to silence debate on the issues.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> He was sharing an opinion almost 50 years ago. How does that quote equate to the GOP embracing racism as a policy? Nixon only said that as Southern racists get turned off by the Democrat party they will likely turn to the only other option which is the GOP. 

If that is all the proof you can offer then the only thing you have proven is that the Left is prejudiced against anyone who is different from them.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This whole switching sides meme is a false claim by the Left. I agree that the Democrats renounced overt racism that they supported up til the civil rights movement but nowhere has it been proven that the GOP, the party of Lincoln and Ike who sent federal troops in to desegregate Southern Democrat states switched and embraced racism as a party goal or platform. Logic proves this: voters who are overt racists make up a tiny percentage of the public. Voters who would be offended by racism make up a huge majority of voters. Why would any party embrace a tiny group for support at the expense of a huge support group? It makes no logical sense.  </TEXT>
