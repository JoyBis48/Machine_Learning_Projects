	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I know calling us autistic or aspies is something countless people online can't go ten minutes without doing, but this is a sincere questions without malice. /u/ScalSaver noticed some points in a recent thread about the character: 

she doesn't pick up on facial cues quickly, if at all.
but she doesn't quite get that other ponies don't know what she knows (= bad theory of the mind)
She has difficulty understanding what other ponies are thinking.


That seems a pretty reasonable case, whether or not it's intentional. </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2014-12-29 22:54:25 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> My brother insists that Pinkie Pie works better when she's actually a kind of compassionate being. She's supposed to be so desperate for parties and fun because it's the only way she knows to try to make others happy. That's why it's supposed to be so important to her when she gets her cutie mark that her family like her party set up, and that if she only cared so much about candy and stuff she could have just entertained herself. That's also why when no one's around she goes so crazy. 

I argued that it makes her too much of a goody-goody and that she needs to have some selfishness and such. She's also kind of stunted and oblivious at the end of the day, and she'd be less compelling if she's so selfless.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I was watching Reefer Madness: The Musical. There's this scene where the main character's love interest is shot in the chest and she's bleeding out. The guy is cradling her in his arms and she reprises an earlier song "We are just like Romeo and Juliet. We're happy, young, and * Cough * Hemorrhaging blood." Now obviously the movie is deliberately goofy, their relationship is clearly unhealthy, and the lyrics are silly. Really, I imagine audience members would usually hate the character singing by design. But I actually welled up when I heard that line being sung. My only excuse is that Kristen Bell is a very good singer and all that, but damn, I bet it would have gotten a laugh if in the movie there had been a cut to a close up of someone watching that scene.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> NOTE: You don't have to agree that it was a sexist movie, it just has to be one where you would have thought people would complain about it. 

I was archive binging and read an old review about Clerks and I was surprised that it hadn't occurred to me that its gender politics are kinda questionable, especially since the indie film world that made Kevin Smith's name is so attached to progressives: http://www.avclub.com/article/the-new-cult-canon-iclerksi-2239

Any other movies where you're surprised more people didn't talk about that?

	<TEXT> I know it's a stereotype that FA people idealize the idea of having a relationship to an insane extent, but I had a reaction that I think was an example of this that I think most people would think was pretty funny. 

I was watching Reefer Madness: The Musical. There's this scene where the main character's love interest is shot in the chest and she's bleeding out. The guy is cradling her in his arms and she reprises an earlier song "We are just like Romeo and Juliet. We're happy, young, and * Cough * Hemorrhaging blood." Now obviously the movie is deliberately goofy, their relationship is clearly unhealthy, and the lyrics are silly. Really, I imagine audience members would usually hate the character singing by design. But I actually welled up when I heard that line being sung. My only excuse is that Kristen Bell is a very good singer and all that, but damn, I bet it would have gotten a laugh if in the movie there had been a cut to a close up of someone watching that scene. 

So yeah, there's a real "that guy needs a girlfriend" moment for you. Yours?   </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I know that cancer is actually many diseases that sort of get lumped into one category. Let's just say one that would be most feasible for a small, underground organization to make.

This is for a story I'm working on in case you're wondering. Profit margin isn't really an issue since the characters involved are driven by ideology. Also the characters are intended to be chemists themselves and thus can steal and bribe to get materials not normally available.

Thanks for your time.

	<TEXT> Obviously it barely matters that the characters in MLP are horses, but just around the time I was joining the herd I got a quick gig feeding and watering horses for a family. They really weren't that nice, with only the oldest one being willing to let me pet it at all or anything. 

One thing that stands out in my memory about that gig was one night it got horribly cold, like -7. I lost a bit of sleep worrying about how cold they'd be in their stables. Then I showed up and let them out for their feeding, and one of them started rolling around in the snow. I should have been she was okay, but I remember being pissed that I'd  been worrying about this horse and then it felt like she was unwittingly rubbing in my face what a waste that worry had been.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not saying I'm above it or anything. I just know from second hand experience that of course relationships don't solve all your ills. I have to imagine anyone that would settle for me would probably come to resent me pretty quickly. I'm probably not mature enough to adjust to a relationship and at twenty-eight it's probably a bit too late.  

Not that I've lived a bad life and this is some kind of tragedy. In fact, sometimes it helps things feel a little better.  </TEXT>
