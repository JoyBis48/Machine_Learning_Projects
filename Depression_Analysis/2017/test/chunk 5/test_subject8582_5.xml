	<TEXT> If one were to take all the magical girls, from Madoka Kaname to Sailor Moon, and average them out, that would be the first fighter. Keep in mind that the *most* powerful magical girl is probably Madoka, as she became God. 

1: how powerful is this average magical girl? Who can she beat?

If one did the same things for mechas, from the glorified forklift from Aliens up to Super Tengan Toppa Gurren Lagann (and the Infinity Jeager) that would be fighter number two. 

2: how powerful is this mech? What can it beat? Who is its pilot?

3: the two do battle. Who wins? At what cost?

4: Both are competing for the same time slot on Toonami. Who wins? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's the silliest thing we all noticed the second or third time through Back to the Future. The timeline takes a whole week to catch up to Marty after he almost makes his parents not get hitched. This even seems to contrast the other two movies and how time acts there. But it actually doesn't work this way. 

The indicator (the photo in the first movie) is not actually displaying not the future Marty comes from as he changes it, but rather the possibilities of how each subsequent timeline changes the photo. By screwing up his parents meeting, he creates an infinite number of timelines, each of which has a different string of events following the accident. As time goes on, many of these events are narrowed out because that's how time works. Once those are gone, the timelines resulting in his parents not getting married become more and more likely until (at the Dance) Marty's existence becomes so unlikely that he wouldn't be able to save them in any way if it weren't for the fact that he *knew*. So the indicator is the only reason the chance wasn't straight-up zero, and how he was able to create one of the only sequences of events leading to his birth.  </TEXT>

So if Tunniel had to be captured, what if Unit-00, Null, or Rei in 01 managed to take down Tunniel </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't know where in Jersey you are, so I can't give specific recommendations, but my general advice is this: 

Try and find a small pizza shop in town owned by an Italian-American couple (preferably named Joseph and Marie, but that's entirely optional). Big-name pizza places like Domino's and Papa John's are usually pretty bad, at least by Jersey standards. New Jersey (as well as NYC and a little bit North into Connecticut) has a near-endless supply of local restaurants who know how to make pizza right. Walking around in town for a bit should yield results.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Depends on where in Jersey you live. Plenty of responses here have some good NJ pizza, but my general advice is either to use Yelp (or some equivalent) or to find a small, non-chain pizza place by just walking around. Chances are you'll find a good thin-crust pizza with that method. 

If you live in or around Princeton, I can personally recommend Conte's and Pizza Star. For Mercerville, I would say DiLorenzo's.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Neon Genesis Evangelion and Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann. Two Gainax mechas, considered by many to be the pinnacle of their genre. So is it possible that they're really one and the same? 

Both feature a magical power based on the soul of the user, namely AT fields and Spiral Power. They both serve many purposes, the main one being an "explain everything" scapegoat. The main antagonists of the shows (SEELE and the Antispiral) wish to rid the universe of ATSpiral as it is an evolutionary dead end that will lead the universe to destruction. 

Let's look at the Antispiral, actually. It's a being formed from the collective souls of a spiral race formed into one. SEELE wanted to complete the Human Instrumentality Project to being their species into one collective consciousness and rid themselves of the need for individual AT Fields. They also have proven to be fans of giant robots, which would explain the Granzeboma. So Gurren Lagann could be a reality in which Third Impact went according to plan, and SEELE got to try and rid the universe of humanity.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Are we all just gonna ignore the implications that Tunniel's existence has on the world of Rebuild? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> In 2.22, Tunniel is the Third Angel, meaning it arrived before Sachiel. It presumably arrived at the same time as Adams and Lilith, considering Sachiel was still the first angel to arrive for 15 years. And its designation is the *third* angel, meaning it is in fact separate from the Adams and Lilith. And SEELE, holders of the Dead Sea Scrolls, have also confirmed it to be the Third. Both of the Angels who showed up around Second Impact were seeds of life, so if Tunniel showed up around that time as well, that means there's a good chance we're missing a whole other seed of life. It could also explain where the Spear of Cassius/other Longinus came from since Lilith lost hers in First Impact.  </TEXT>
