	<TEXT> And seriously most of us would agree if you toned it down a bit. No one is saying OMG .. FINALLY.. I MEAN FUCKING FINALLY... WHOOOPI!!! HALLELUJAH OUR DAY HAS COME OUR DAY HAS COME.

But notice woopie said it, and then daiyuesen posted it, you bitched about it.. bohemianabe properly calls you out.. and then i am posting.. THATS CALLED GETTING A CONVERSATION STARTED.


we need MORE PEOPLE talking about this.. not less. Not sure why you seem to have a logical handicap when it comes to that fact.

Is whoopi the best person on the fucking planet to be talking about it? Do I wish this was the pope, warran or obama.. hey probably, but this is still a good thing.. and sill a good post. Sorry if you hate whoopi dude. SHE HAS A SHOW.. which i suspect you do not. She mentioned our issue, and she is getting more people to talk about it. I dare say, she probably did more with tha one comment than you ass has done the entire time it has been here.

Seriously do you know how a movement works? Hey if you want us to attack woopi.. like you just did and kick her out and ask her to stfu about student loans.. you seem to think that will help? no? a bit over the top? well reread your first comment dude. like I said I might agree, but you went way over the top.

	<TEXT> yeah and there is good evidence it has to do with taking the lead out of our gas.

and for those who dont know the history of how fascists work in america, yall should look up the history of diethyl lead and the scientists who discovered it was bad for all of us.(the scientist who discovered diethyl lead was also the dude who unfortunately gave us CFCs as well.) you will recognize the methods of attack as well as many of the attackers.

how [lead causes americans crime epidemic](http://www.forbes.com/sites/alexknapp/2013/01/03/how-lead-caused-americas-violent-crime-epidemic/)

[did removing lead cause drop in crime](http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-27067615)

whats bad is we have known for 2000 years that ingestion of lead causes people to be more violent.

but when scientists said it was a bad idea to spew it in our air all to keep our cars from knocking...they were attacked as liberals who wanted big gov to control our lives and the dems only wanted to help catalytic converter donors and they were all on the dole just to hurt poor defenceless big oil. They got death threats.. while big oil/gas went to the heartland to get fake scientists to say it was all ok. A gas ceo dranked a glass of what he said was diethyl lead for the reporters.. it wasnt .. HE WOULD BE DEAD. 100%


and when we finally said ok the science is too much to deny.. we got to ban this shit.. we left in 2 exceptions. one for nascar.. cause no one breathes nascar air(which they just recently a couple years ago, stopped using lead) and we allow american companies to sell it abroad to this day.. cause no one shares any air. but the good thing is the PPM in our atomosphere has declined a ton. As of 2013 it is finally nearly completely banned due to other countries laws and not our own.. but there are still a few countries and things that use it.

of course, dont blame the corps and theri fake scientists.. WHICH THEY KNEW WERE FAKE.. AND THEY KNEW THEY WERE LYING.. ESPECIALLY THAT BASTARD WHO DRANK THE SHIT... dont blame them for the deaths and shit that occurred as they fought true science and the removal of lead from our gas.

	<TEXT> I'm really surprised at the angles the GOP have chosen on this. Really i would have chanted up and down, that there is a reason why we seal the records of minors.. that we as a society that minors havent developed enough to make proper choices, and so we have set up the judicial system to not ruin kids lives for life, due to mistakes they made as a children and yes this often includes very extreme unsupportable mistakes. 

and really thats something i could actually support. the kid might have been an evil, perverted little shit, but he was still a kid and our society says they are different, even in many cases of murder.


the right could have brought up brain science and how the brain isnt fully formed until arround age 25.. yeah they hate science.

but it seems like all the supporters are taking the religious avenue of defence/attack. 'god forgave him and so should we'.. well hallelujah , lets empty the prisons then.. there is a fuck ton of god in there. And doesnt this open cruz up to asking if he thinks it should be legal?

yeah some on the right have mentioned his age, but.. well the right havent been as good at chanting in unison on that. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> hes only running to spread messages like this.. and the earning potential.

much like sanders, he doesnt have a chance to do much else.
(hey i love sanders but, reality and vegas says he has no chance)

the reason they run, is to drive the party.. much like sanders wants to start a more progressive discussion, cruz wants to start a bat shit insane, lets have a religious based government discussion.


at any rate the main reason cruz supports duggar, isnt because he is a christian, but because his family is uber powerful in the republican party. though his comments is supported by the bible and all that crap, this is more about politics.. if you noticed huckabee took the time to not only forgive dugger, but also mel gibson for his anti semitic rant long ago... and to attack the liberal media for making such a big deal about it.

its part of the efforts to radicalize the religious right wing, for political purposes. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would respond, but your choice of examples already made my case for me.

translated as "I would respond but cant, so I will just say something snarky.".. seriously this is what passes for debate skills for you right wingers. Yall always do this to. When you lose the debate you stick out your tongue and say NA UH!!!

DUDE the dems fought for women to get birthcontrol covered. MY EXAMPLE IS LEGIT.

your party praises and fights for the hobby lobby ruling and is against gay marriage. DEMS HAVENT JUST TALKED ABOUT IT.. they actually have legalized it all over the country

my example is legit.

The dems havetn just talked about healthcare reform they have reformed it.

SERIOUSLY You AND YOUR ILK.. say republicans who refuse to expand medicaid in their states, whcih will lead to 17000 deaths this year, are exactly the same as all the dems who did infact push for the medicaid expansion and expanded it in their own states?

**DONT BE A TARD ALL YOUR LIFE DUDE... I CAN BURY YOU WITH PROOF THEY ARNE THE SAME**

THE DEMS PASSED NET NEUTRALITY WHILE THE RIGHT ARE FIGHTING IT.. AND THIS TARD SAYS BOTH PARTIES ARE EXACTLY THE SAME. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  If you had done any research using non Arab sources you'd know better. 

look little douchebag.. quit trying to assume. This is your biggest little flaw. "I AM RIGHT AnD YALL ARE WRONG AND IF YOU DONT ACCEPT MY OPINION, IT IS BECAUSE YOU ARE TOO STUPID TO RESEARCH OR ONLY RESEARCHED BIASED PLACES.. UNLIKE ME CAUSE I AM GREAT"

fuck off dude, you didnt even read my comment.

IT DOESNT FUCKING MATTER.

yeah the ottonman king when he wanted more ttaxes changed some laws on ownership which made the people in the area transfer deeds to one person in town and have him claim to be the land owner. SO FUCKING WHAT.

people live on that land.

I've lived in my apartment for a decade, does that mean I own it? How about if I kill my landlord?

SEE right back at you dude. I guess the israelis own the occupied territory they keep putting settlements on despite it is illegal under international law. NOT FROM ARAB SOURCES. NONE OF MY KNOWLEDGE IS.. actually most is from the encyclopedias and the bbc birth of israel which i am quite sure you will claim is biased case they disagree with you as well.

And yes, you are idiots. Sending generations of young men, women, and children to die to gain a unattainable goal.

LOL.. ok i am just going to stop feeding the troll or talking to the crazy person. Who is sending who were? what teh fuck are you on dude?

Dude you need some serious help. This isnt hyperbole or an attack, but you got some issues that need working out. The least of which is your sheer lack of the ability to debate without being a pompous ass.

	<TEXT> downvoting because it doesnt matter.

First the ottomans.. actually not totally true though yeah the king owned a fucking ton of the land, before we overthrew.. I guess that means it is OURS now. to do with what we want.. and the people who actually have lived on the land for generations.. WELL FUCK THEM.

dude, no we are downvoting due to your low effort reply, that since the INDIVIDUALS didnt own the land but their KING DID and we OVERTHREW HIM.. therefore they have no say.  Its horse shit. and give off your high horse when you assume only you know what the fuck you are talking about dude.

the only valid complain you have is "downvoteing without debating"

but when you say 'downvoting without researching" basically you are calling all of us idiots for not acception your point of view and the fact is some of us researched the shit and we still find your comment horseshit. So enjoy another downvote. Cause this comment is horseshit as well.

I cant stand how dems keep voting to make women buy seperate health insurance for things like birth control.

	<TEXT> doesnt seem wise to me.

First off, though it doesnt say in the article, it suggests this comes about due to an anti tank missile hitting a bus, fired from gaza.

removing palestinian passengers not only doesnt alleviate this threat, but seems to me it would increase it. You have to assume they have to get people willing to shoot at these buses, knowing they carry fellow country men.. and well now the buses will only have israelis. seems from a security standpoint, a mixed bus would be much safer. I know some of past actions have freely taken palestinian lives as well is israeli but even with that knowledge it still would seem safer to have mixed buses.

and even if it is suicide bombings that could be alleviated with check points before boarding. IDk someone convince me why this is a good idea.

there are arguments for not even using one. however you need to  have 800mb one on the c drive for memory dumps in crashes.. though most people dont use memory dumps for diags.. so you can get by with none.

anyways click windows key and R

type sysdm.cpl ,3 

in the system properties that pops up click performance..

then advanced.


click change under virtual memory.

uncheck automatically...


set it to the drives you want.

	<TEXT> The filibusters are great but.

1. they scheduled the renewal vote at this date, so that it is early enough from an election that they wont get in trouble.

2. the last vote had 72 yays, more than enough to bypass any filibuster or even a veto(which there is no threat)

3. since that 72 vote, the senate has become more conservative.(and if you dont get what I mean by that look at the last roll call for the patriot act.. it only passed because nearly every republican but rand voted for it. and he filibustered it last time as well.


so call me pessimistic... but i dont see much coming from this.

	<TEXT> . A 1983 Missouri law requires that women buy optional insurance for elective abortion coverage.

wow. I'd like to see if that is constitution, or an undo extra burden on womens rights. No other medical procedure do you require "extra insurance'.. basically the state is saying that a woman must expect prehand that she will have an abortion for what ever reasons. And pay extra for that 'right'


and yeha they damn well know most wont get the extra insurance, because most people who get abortions never ever expected to have to get one.

now work from my pc.. and having teh phones right next to me.. its a bit more than easy to keep them going.

it you cant be near the phones... well its still kinda worth it IMO, you'll prolly at least pay off the phones and you can reuse them for all kinds of things, get an odm meter and use one in the car as a smart meter.. well most new cars do this but for older these are awesome.. can use one as a back up cam.. or a bird feeder cam.. hook to an rc, and have a driving drone.

last month they had a good 2 whole weeks of shitty service.. many crashes, and lock ups. It really blew, i thought they were going out of business. but the past week has been decent as far as crashes go..except on perk quiz which has been locking up the past 2 days.

	<TEXT> it can vary wildly with perk, depending on a lot of things from where you live, to which version and which apps and how you run them.  For the most part you can get 40-80 cents a day per phone on perk.. you can get higher but then it becomes less passive.(or by cheating)

but like with perk swipe and perklive  tv combined with netflix or youtube shows.. you can manually increase your earnings rates up a bit.

yeah i know kinda vague but the answers are all over the chart in /r/perktv these days.. the range is a bit too high to give a proper average.

	<TEXT> it seems to be multiple ads.

what I dont get, is all my phones will freeze around the same time but on different ads.. however the ones that happen to be on the same ad all freeze at the same spot.

I almost never ever get the "are you still watching"

everything locks up before then </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2015-04-19 03:00:10 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> i want to be able to look at each ship.. like shipyard view and know when various components failed. Power levels and ammo levels through out the fight. So if i am always losing certain things its easier to see and armor more. or move it.

i want to see the damage caused by each weapon.. what was effective, whats useless. i want to mouse over the jammer and see it jammed 10 missiles that would have caused this much damage if they hit.. while the defensive flairs saved me this much damage.

right now is hard to tell even if the little ships that get blown away fast are worth even having.. or not.. sure they die but do they help?

ship creation is def the coolest part of the game, but could be way better if i had the data i needed to make much better ships. I would play more with the various upgrades, rather than just be mostly concerned with costs and weights.

the game has that computer aiming system, says its better than recruits.. how the hell can i tell.

is turning on rapid fire using up my ammo before it is effective?

i need data!! to become the ship builder of my dreams.

	<TEXT> I'm a bit bad at editing my comments, and am slow at it, and often see i already have upvotes after i save. and i figure people should know, so they can take back their upvote if they want.

i dont personally know of anyone completely altering their view to make a bad view it look popular after the fact. But i personally have accidentally left off a contraction.. used an are instead of an aren't which totally changes the comment.  none of those times had many upvotes/downvotes but it could happen. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I hear this advice, but when i look at Articles on tips and tricks.. they suggest at level 10.. 90% of the trade hq is expansion parts.

It doesnt work this way anymore. you can often see zero in the list. Most of the time its 2 or 3 out of the dozen or so they have listed.

its completely boring trying to not level up.. and expand under these conditions.(yeah i will try the second account thing latter)..

So basically my question is .. you guys at the higher level, when you go into the gthq, how much expansion material do you see amongst yoru donuts and what not? cause if it is 2-3 like us at level 10.. I'm going back to actually playing. </TEXT>

the STUPID MOTHERFUCKING IF YOU LIKE PERK APP POP UP.

is this the new "are you still watching" timer?

Fuck love how they delay it by microseconds to try to trick you into clicking.

Wouldnt be so bad though, if it didnt crash perk.. ALL THE FUCKING TIME.

I dont think I have ever got the pop up ad without it crashing perk first.

game gives us an open world and then locks us into that mission for  ages..(ok i suck a bit) but jesus.. from searching every floor of  the school, to the pit levels, to getting out of the pit.. to having seizures despite i stole some antacin early on in the game.. before destroying that batch i found.

hey i get main missions gonna be a bit long... but damn that one. 

maybe give us average mission times, in the quest area.. so we know "hey if you start this one.. its gonna be a while" </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Basically asking for scientific guesstimates on what the sky would have looked like.

I figure our light cone radius should be shrunk by even more than 4 billion light years due to inflation. And I figure due to actual relative movement, some have moved out of view and will come back into view as we go back 4 billion years.

 I also get the milkyway was younger, I dont have much info on galactic development.. if baring mergers they quickly reach an average star level or slowly lose stars after an initial burst. And I dont know if we had a merger in that period or how many.

I'm guessing we would see a lot more stars with the naked eye. and with the galaxies closer, i guess they get bigger and brighter too. **Just how cool was the night sky 4 billion years ago.**

4-5 times as many stars? a lot brighter?  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> South Carolina here.

Basically that. Card blew up, was under warranty. Was told it couldn't be repaired and they didn't have an adequate replacement. I agreed to take money instead. They asked me a little bit later if I wanted to wait and see if they got in new batch of refurbs at the end of the month. I said no, I would rather just take the money. Doubled checked with them a few days later to see when money would arrive. They said 3 business days, accounting was cutting the check. I bought a used card of ebay expecting the check. 

In three business days, a videocard arrived at my house instead of the check I was expecting. I figured, they obtained a last minute replacement, and figured it might be their right to honor the original warranty agreement instead of the check as agreed to in emails. I was annoyed, but since I mine the BTC, i put the card to use. But not having the check, coupled with me buying a new card, this has me strapped a bit.(it also didn't add a lot of power as I replaced a card slightly worse than it, as I don't have the power supplies yet to run that many cards.. so not a lot of income gain)

 It's been a week. And suddenly i get a check in the mail from them.


I'd rather have the cash, and more than willing to send back the card... on their dime. If that is an option for me. However, I have already used it for a week.

whats my best options. And Can I go ahead and cash the check in the time being. </TEXT>

I'd like to see if I can get a similar boost with these drivers with the other algos.

But amd doesnt have them, all the usual areas and links for linux drivers have turned up empty and there are a quite a few searchers like myself with no luck.
