	<TITLE> Finally taking the plunge on a 3DS and a new Pokemon game </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-03-28 18:26:41 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm leaning towards the new 3DS since it has better everything compared to the other models you can get new, although the colors don't excite me. :/

I think I am gonna go for Pokemon Y to start with although I eventually want Alpha Sapphire too.

Are there any bundles I should look for? Is it better to get the cartridge or download the game digitally? [I would cry if my pokes became corrupted]

Also, how easy is it for me to send mons from Diamond or HG or Black?

Thanks y'all! </TEXT>

I'd suggest getting single serving stuff or focusing more on veggies and things he can't sneak sugar into. Also, the best diet tip is drink nothing but water so it would be pretty hard for him to sabotage that. :) </TEXT>
