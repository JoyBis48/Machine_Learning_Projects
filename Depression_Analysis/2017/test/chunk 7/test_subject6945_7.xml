	<TITLE> Some VE juices to trade. </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Hi, 

i have a few [juices here from VE](http://i.imgur.com/C6smCER.jpg) that iv mixed to 3mg, I'm not too fond of them and no one i know really likes them so i just wanted to see what i can get for them.
 


I have some Grandpa Joes - 40ml

Caramelised  tobacco - 30ml

Watermelon Slush - 15 ml

Ghost blaster - 12ml

Death by guava - 28 ml 

Cinnamon cookie - 13ml 

All measurements are guess's but i think they are accurate enough.

Please don't mind the labels on a few of the bottles, i tried steeping in a slow cooker on the keep warm setting which worked like a charm but the bag i put them in had a hole which damaged the labels.   

If there is anything you like let me know, i live in Melbourne and would rather meet up to trade but if thats not an option shipping can be arranged. 

Cheers. 

Edit - I'm not too fussed on what i get for these, i cut my losses long ago and am just clearing out, ill take any sort of juice that tickles my fancy (3mg preferred) just let me know what you have :)    </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah i have already lost myself to the joys and wonders of coil building. 

At the moment i'm using a 30w hana clone with a lemo, and i just got an order from fast tech with all my new mechs and attys (all clones) so i spent the better part of my night playing around with them. 

I'm loving my dark horse clone ontop of a nemesis. Looks and feels great    </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So iv been off the analogs for a month now, the only downside to the whole thing is the little wet spot I get on my mo when I exhale. My facial hair is a god damn vape magnet. Drives me bananas. 

Anyway, thanks for being the awesome bunch of guys and gals you are. Happy holidays! </TEXT>
