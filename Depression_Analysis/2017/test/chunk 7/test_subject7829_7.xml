	<TEXT> After reading this board and other sources for about a year I think I'm ready for my first psychedelic experience. I've sort of settled on Amanitas since they're legal, readily available from high-rated sellers, and organic (the white-powder RC's from shady vendors scare me).

However people seem to have very mixed experiences with with these mushrooms, with a large number of dud and bad trips. Is there anyone who's had success with Amanitas that would like to offer some tips on how to make the experience a good one, or am I off on the wrong track choosing them for a first trip? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Force or not, we need a way to describe gravity on quantum scales, and such a thing has proven elusive so far.

Wouldn't entropic gravity be a description of gravity on the quantum scale? That is, the theory is that there are more random quantum "opportunities" for a particle to move in the direction of the gravitational (pseudo)-force than in the opposite direction, or am I misunderstanding? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Problems with the Poisson Distribution - did I find an error in the textbook? Plus something surprising I discovered while researching the possible error that I can't explain... </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-04-30 00:51:32 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> The problem in question stated "a golfer has a long-term mean of 3.9 strokes per hole. What is the probability that he scores more than a 72 in an 18-hole game?"

The textbook said to solve this using Poisson and P(x4) for a mean of 3.9 - I don't think this is valid since the probability of getting more than four strokes on any given hole cannot be equated to *averaging* more than 4 strokes over the course of 18 holes, because of the Law of Large Numbers.

The problem is, when I solved P(x72) using a mean of 70.2 (3.9 times 18), it evaluated to a *greater* probability than what was in the textbook. I would have thought the Law of Large Numbers would imply a smaller probability.

Here are the relevant calculations. Can anyone tell me the error in my reasoning?

[P(x4| mean = 3.9) = 0.351635](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1-+%28sum+%283.9^x%29%28e^%28-3.9%29%29%2F%28x!%29+for+x+from+0+to+4%29)

[P(x72| mean= 70.2) = 0.384819](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1-+[sum+%2870.2^x%29%28e^%28-70.2%29%29%2F%28x!%29+for+x+from+0+to+72]) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would hesitate to call someone a fanatic unless they are imposing their beliefs on others. It is a recognized yogic practice in India, it wasn't invented by some nut on the Internet. Those pictures of Indian gods, especially Shiva and Kali, that you see with long tongues sticking out are supposedly references to the practice. 

Apparently though, there is a reasoning behind it that goes beyond the merely spiritual: According to what I've heard, in the throat cavity there are two sensitive regions that are very similar to what is found in the genitals. "Celibate" yogis would get their tongue up in there and basically get themselves off. Bizarrely enough, this was basically the plot of that 70's porno "Deep Throat" though a tongue wasn't the instrument used...

I do not know if any of this is true and I'm not about to cut my tongue tendon to find out, though if anyone on here has done such a practice I'd love to hear from them! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hmm, it might be a bit of a stretch but could we consider a function with a variable arity, perhaps one that varied according to a probability distribution? 

For example, I could imagine a random walk that always changes its x and y coordinates for each step of the walk, but only changes the z coordinate when a uniform random variable on [0,1] that is calculated at each step of the walk has a value above 0.5.

Could such a walk be considered to be moving in 2.5 dimensions? If so, what would the probability be that it returns to its starting point? We know that for two dimensions it will always return, but for 3 it only returns about 34% of the time. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was thinking this myself yesterday. I heard a documentary on in the background with a female narrator and I just knew it was early 80's without even seeing the video quality or hearing much about the subject matter. Turns out it was 1981. 

My completely unscientific theory is there was some leftover "hippie" intonation that sort of merged with the "polite secretary" but was then pushed out by the "valley girl" and the "local news announcer" sometime in the mid-80's. I fondly wish for the return of that old female accent but I'm not too hopeful. In fact the default female public-speaking voice seems to have become even harsher and more aloof-sounding in recent years, especially on radio commercials. </TEXT>

It depends on how long this spawning process has been going on for. However, that doesn't apply to my original post because we are looking at a *ratio* of young to old universes, not the expected age of a randomly chosen universe. In the magic coin room, it's pretty clear that the ratio of "new" (1-year-old or less) coins to "old" coins will always be 1:1, and in the theory the ratio of young to old universes will always be very very large. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's part of Eternal Inflation Cosmology (EIC), which states that universes are constantly bubbling into existence as part of an Eternal Big Bang. You may have heard the saying "The Big Bang never ended." That is talking about EIC.

Depending on how you set the parameters for the formulas in this theory, the rate of universe production might appear to be increasing drastically every second. 

Imagine a room that, for every person of age "x," has a million people of age "x-1." The vast majority of people in that room will be very young.

What does that have to do with the Fermi Paradox? Well, imagine that room again. Take the number of people in that room who have had time to have children of their own. The vast majority of people with children will have had only one. There are a trillion 18-year olds for every 20-year old, after all. Replace "children" with "spawned an intelligent civilization," and you have the idea. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This one's my favorite:

Cosmologist Alan Guth proposed a multi-verse solution to the Fermi Paradox. In this theory, using the synchronous gauge probability distribution, young universes exceedingly outnumber older ones (by a factor of e1037 for every second of age). Therefore, averaged over all universes, universes with civilizations will almost always have just one, the first to develop.

Always thinking outside the box, that guy.  </TEXT>

I've read some criticism of Campbell that claimed he was proto-Fascist for reducing all of human culture to the struggle of the Hero, I think that's going too far, but it could be that he was too wedded to his idea of the Monomyth to see the dialectical possibility in the Hero breaking out of it. </TEXT>

I was certain when watching this series for the first time that this was the "twist" waiting at the end, but Campbell either never saw it or didn't think it was suitable for public consumption. He maybe hints at it in his discussion of the Native American "twins" myth cycle (where the twins witness their own story being written by the gods and try to reject it.) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You don't need Excel, this is one of the simpler spaces: It is called a multiset (or a multichoose) Sometimes it is called a "stars and bars" problem because of how it is diagrammed. A multiset shows up when you are choosing with replacement (allowing duplicates), but you don't care about the order in which the choices were made (which I assume is happening here since you used the word combination.)

You can turn a multiset into a regular combination by using the formula (n + r - 1) C (r). So, n = 21 and r = 10 for your example, so the size of the sample space would be 30 C 10 = 30,045,015

If you *do* care about order then the size is just n^r, so 21^10 which is around 16.7 trillion. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I often encounter these terms when reading about the Middle Ages, but they never seem to be well-defined. Confusingly, monasteries often tend to be headed by abbots, but abbots are also found in abbeys. 

Are these vague terms that were used interchangeably, or did they have specific meanings in Church law, etc.? </TEXT>

That having been said, many people *do* experience changing or unreadable text, and use it as a good reality check. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> *Sunyata* is a term in Buddhism that is often translated as "emptiness" or "void." But as with most translations, it leaves something to be desired. *Sunyata* is like the emptiness of a cup, not the emptiness of "nothingness." The air or water inside the cup is not part of the cup itself, yet, without it, the cup would cease to be a cup. That is, the cup's very identity as a cup depends on some part of itself being not-cup. 

If we reflect on it, the same is true of ourselves. If you are not willing to change yourself, if you are not open to growth or new experiences, then you might as well be a pre-programmed computer or robot. Anyone who actually attains an eternal, unchanging self (*atta*), immediately ceases to be a self at all, and becomes an object with no more life in them than a rock has. 

Therefore our continuation as subjects is dependent on being open and receptive to non-self, to a willingness to incorporate that which is non-self into our identities (using discernment of course.)

Sometimes for these reasons you will see *sunyata* translated as "receptivity" instead of "emptiness." My feeling is it's somewhere in-between these two concepts.  </TEXT>

That's an understatement. Reich would be classified as "New Age" if he were alive today. In fact his works are still popular in New Age circles, whereas both Freudian and Marxist thinkers tend to dismiss them. Reich was sort of a latter-day Jung with even more of a mystical bent, but the US government found him threatening enough that he was actually imprisoned and died in jail. </TEXT>

So my ambition would be to convince someone to go on a DMT trip - or to go on one myself- armed with a large random integer and ask any "intelligences" they meet to factor it.

	<TEXT> The actual doctrine is "anatta" which is usually (mis)-translated as "no-self." The Vedic concept of the "atta" is very different from the modern Western ideas about a "self." The atta was said to be eternal, unchanging, and identical with the Universal Principle (Brahman).

This is the "self" that the Buddha demolished philosophically, not the idea of a changing, growing, interconnected self.

If you think about it, an unchanging self isn't a subject at all, but an object. It is those who believe in an atta who have to ask "for whom is this done?" since there is no way to change the atta. Buddhism can answer - it is done out of compassion for our future selves as well as other beings. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Uh, I doubt that Hollywood has killed every character who ever said "God dammit." On the other hand, that punishing disbelief thing is very real though you're not the first to notice it. Part of it is just the convention of telling a good story - it's hard to make a good ghost story where the ghost turns out to be a hoax*, so of course the disbelievers in a horror movie will end up looking like idiots, but part of it is indeed playing to the desire the audience has for the paranormal/supernatural to indeed be real.

Critics have also long noted that supposedly "liberal" Hollywood movies also tend to punish people who have unconventional, kinky, underage or casual sex, especially in the horror genre. Say "God dammit" and you're probably safe, but be a teen having sex in a horror movie, you're screwed.

	<TEXT> I still think stuff like "Yea we should totaly do that" in my head when I'm thinking of something I should do ALONE.

Sort of embarrassing but I started doing that Freshman year of college when I was having a tough time socially. The "we" was me and one of my friends from HS who had gone to a different college. I don't know why I picked him probably because he was the most laid-back of my HS friends so he was a good imaginary companion. The weird thing is I talked to the real friend online but never told him I made an imaginary version of him to keep me company... I think that might have ended the real friendship pretty quick.

Anyway now years later I still say "we have to go shopping" to myself but I'm not thinking specifically of that friend anymore, it's just a generalized "we" made up of all the different aspects of myself. </TEXT>

Funny, that is now the hot trend in education again. Our Juniors and Seniors get three class credits for "job training" at the local fast food places and Wal-Mart. They can leave school at lunch. Needless to say this program is quite popular. Our district has even won awards for its "progressive" "apprenticeship" program. Of course it is all nonsense.

Many of those people *were* reasonably good-looking in High School when they began their reproductive careers though...

All in all, saying that darwinian evolution worldview cannot align with a religious worldview demonstrates a lack of understanding of evolution and a lack of understanding of religion.

Maybe, but religion considers itself true, not just useful. There is a conflict on that level. Very few people follow a religion just because they think it is a socially convenient myth.

	<TEXT> Social Darwinism used race as a virtual synonym for species, which it clearly is not - human races are 100% inter-fertile. 

Similarly, Social Darwinism argued for a political authority that would wield a kind of "artificial selection" that could replace and "hurry up" the process of natural selection, and used dog breeding as an example. 

The problem with this was dog breeding took hundreds of years on an animal with a much shorter generational cycle than humans, and actually increased the diversity of dogs - it did not lead to one breed of "Master Dog" the way many Social Darwinists wanted to (re)-create the "Master Race."

So not only was there moral horror from Scientific Darwinists against Social Darwinism, there was scientific outrage as well, since Social Darwinism was the crudest form of pseudoscience used to advance political ends. </TEXT>
