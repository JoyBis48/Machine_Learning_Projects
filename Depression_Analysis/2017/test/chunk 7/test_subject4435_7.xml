	<TEXT> I wasn't so much saying you were BEING rude, as I was saying that being rude here is a very efficient way of screwing yourself out of an answer. I'm in Canada so maybe the rules are a bit different. I had an uncle who left the RCMP to become a PI. I hang out with car guys so I have had a plentiful helping of what cops are "really like" despite my healthy respect for the profession. Is there really no one on the force you could talk to? I mean even in passing just be like "hey remember that asshole kid who did that thing with the dogs? He just bought a leash and some machetes." I mean if all else fails you could go the vigilante route. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Nosleep is a great place to ask for help but if you're going to be rude to the people here you're more likely to get downvoted to hell than actually helped. 
Otherwise, unless you're off the force for being mentally unfit or otherwise a danger to the public, maybe it's time to ditch WalMart and start a private detective business? So you can keep an eye on things and earn a bit of credibility with the police again so when things do catch your eye, you actually have somewhere to go with it. </TEXT>

And you, my friend, are the first person I've spoken to who knows that's what's happening as well as I do. </TEXT>

Maybe a good scrub down of the house as well, replace some flooring, new paint, breathe some new life into your place. It can do wonders for clarity and peace of mind.

	<TEXT> You and Tom find the cadaver he was snacking on. There must be some security cameras down there. Contact campus police or whoever and ask them to look at the footage as something strange was going on when you walked in. I think people donate their bodies to the lab right? But there's a lot of legal stuff. The authorities are likely to take it seriously if you think tampering of any sort is happening. If campus police won't listen I suggest going to the Dean and involving regular police. Until then, keep the deadbolt in place and pee somewhere else. </TEXT>
