	<TEXT> My brother played Eminem's "Headlights" a few weeks ago. I'm not a fan of rap but my brother is a big Eminem fan so I'm familiar with the story of Eminem's relationship with his mother and that song honestly made me start crying.

But I think it would be 4 Non Blondes "What's Up" at 14. I heard it and that's when I knew music wasn't something you just consume but could mean so much more. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I just bought the Sennheiser HD558s. I like them enough but I can't help but feel they're just a taste of what I'm looking for. A start pretty much. I want headphones that make it sound like I'm right there, right in the room. The 558s still feel like I'm listening through headphones. Any cheap set ups for someone just starting out? I listen to mostly country. </TEXT>

One of the girls my age must've seen me cos she gave those were talking about me shit. Also, heard my aunt joking about me but I love my aunt and forgive her 'cos she just likes to joke around. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks, I'll check it out. I miss rdio simply because people I friended shared the same taste in music and I could see what they were listening to.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ruining their fun I guess. When I didn't drink and would go bar hopping or clubbing I would just order a soda like pepsi or coke and just let everyone assume I was drinking rum and coke. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For those rare nights when I decide to just get drunk I drink lots of water and a bottle of gatorade before I sleep. Still got a hangover when you wake up in the morning? Bacon, more gatorade, and more water. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I made the switch from rdio to google play and so far it's underwhelming. No community, harder to discover music, and adding music isn't a simple click. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I feel like if something was popular, it was everywhere and you couldn't escape it. Pokemon, Spice Girls, Backstreet Boys, Tamagotchi, Titanic, Friends, Windows 95, Sock'em Boppers, Tickle Me Elmo. Nowadays it's easier to ignore things but I kind of miss being caught in a wave of pop culture. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm thinking of getting Sennheiser HD558s. Would these be good headphones to start off with? And would I need an amp/dac or them? I'm seeing the E10k around a lot so should I get those? It'll be for my iPod classic and laptop. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm Native and yes it is. I have a lot of alcoholics in my family. My parents stopped drinking when I was a kid and I'm glad they did because our home life was great compared to others. Education sucks in native communities, poor healthcare, poor housing, little jobs, and residential school really messed up the older generations who then became poor parents to their kids who then became poor parents to their kids. But the new generation is getting slowly better. I see more young people who are breaking the cycle of family addiction who lead healthy lives. I didn't drink until I was in my 20s because of all alcoholism I saw in my hometown. People who get blackout drunk and become violent. But after years of living away from that I felt it was okay to try a beer and now I would consider myself a social drinker, 1-2 drinks tops and I'm done and switching to water. I'm very aware of the stereotype so I try not to get too drunk. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> **Budget** - $25-250  
**Source** - iPod classic, Macbook Pro  
**Isolation** - Doesn't matter  
**Preferred Type** - Over the ear. Or in the ear.  
**Tonal Balance** - I'm not sure.. I don't like too much bass. I like to hear everything.  
**Past headphones** - $20 Sony earbuds that get worse over time and sound muddy now. Sennheiser earbuds that were stolen so I don't remember what they sounded like. I also have Denon AH-D7000s and I find those underwhelming but they're meant for my record player not my iPod.  
**Preferred Music** - Country, country rock, indie rock/pop. I could be listening to anything from acoustic country, country with rock guitars, or lo-fi like The Wavves and then to something like Lorde or Florence and the Machine.  

The store I'm going to carries Sennheiser, AKGs, Audio-Technica, Monster, Bose, Sony and Panasonic. So preferably in those brands. </TEXT>
