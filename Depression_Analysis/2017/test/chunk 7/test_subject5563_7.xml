	<TEXT> Hard to say, you are condensing a 10 hour game experience into a 2 hour movie (maybe 2.5hrs max). I'm a huge fan of the series however I think it would be pretty difficult to work into a film purely because of how the story is written around the game. Not to mention the odd characters that pop up in the film which would confuse the fuck out of focus testers and the studio. I think the best way to do it is to write the film around the story and not the game if you get what I mean.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Will video game based films replace superhero films in the future? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-01-31 05:07:27 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Does anyone here feel that superhero films in the future will feel genre fatigue and start to see less superhero films being released on a yearly schedule? I feel that there are three big video game based films that could have the opportunity to be the equivalent of the the first breakthrough superhero film (e.g Spiderman, X-Men). 

1. Assassins Creed (2016) So this is being filmed right now with Ubisoft having very close creative control on the story of the film. This is a pretty huge franchise which has the potential to earn big bucks at the box office, although the franchise has had a bad rep with gamers due to the last release, Assassins Creed Unity which was released in an unfinished state with an unsatisfying story. This one could go hit or miss in my opinion.

2) Warcraft (2016) This is a big one. Duncan Jones directing the Blizzard made franchise. Warcraft is already a huge name because of the online only game, World of Warcraft. It's a billion dollar franchise played by tens of millions of players around the world. The early footage shown to those lucky people at Blizzcon have had people excited, Blizzard have worked very closely with the story for this game so this one could be a massive hit and break the video game stigma.

3) The Last of Us (20XX) This game was personally my game of last generation. It told a beautifully crafted story between a young girl named Ellie and a much older survivor named Joel, set 20 years in the future after a terrible fungal outbreak which causes people to turn into running fungi mutated versions of themselves, making themselves crazy. This is the best game to show off a mature story and extremely well written characters which are both complex and interesting. My personal take is if this is adapted correctly, it could be a serious contender for it to be an award winner.

Edit: spelling </TEXT>

We have already seen amazing weather and visuals in Driveclub however that runs at 30FPS which is counter to what Polyphony run GT5/6 at. I imagine the cars will probably have a much deeper level of detail, however I hope they drop standard cars all together and run with premiums.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Making split screen is actually a pretty difficult process. You essentially have to render what's on screen twice and also do a lot of bug checking. So if split-screen were there in DC it would look pretty bad compared to full screen single player. The manpower required to make split-screen is not worth the effort considering how many people actually use it.  </TEXT>

It's not a perfect film but I really love how it's shot and how it portrays the drug game. Plus the music in this movie, well all of Mann's films is amazing.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Seriously if people are still hesitant about watching this show, don't be. This was one of the best episodes of television I have seen in a long time. Especially given that it's a show on CBS, this is not too common. The first 2 seasons may be a bit hard to get into as it is procedural for the most part but once it gets firmly into it's serial nature it will become one of your favourite shows most likely. Easily a must watch.  </TEXT>

Not only did you get a glimpse of the second film but at the end the teaser you learn that it will be concluded in a third film to be released the same year.  </TEXT>
