	<TEXT> I just recently left in Feb. But I know a lot about the interviews and how recruiters think.

Like a previous poster said, smile. Always smile.
Don't talk about how much you love Disneyland. They don't care who your favorite character is or how many times you've been.
When they ask you your number one concern, it is ALWAYS safety.
Think about how the four keys of Disneyland (Safety, Courtesy, Show, Efficiency) affect your role and answer the questions in that way. You're not supposed to know those keys right now so don't talk about knowing them but casually mentioning them would be prime (i.e. "I recognize that to be a great CM, I have to be courteous to all guests when performing my role."
That's another one: don't forget to think of yourself when answering questions as a part of a show, a cast member with a role. 
That's about it. They typically offer the jobs on the spot if they like you.

Good luck. Say hi to the Mouse for me.  </TEXT>
