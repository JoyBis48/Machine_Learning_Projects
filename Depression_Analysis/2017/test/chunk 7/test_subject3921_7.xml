	<TEXT> Django Unchained, I hated myself for waiting so long but wow. That movie was absolutely superb and made me one thousand times more excited for Tarantino's "The Hateful Eight".   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My build goes: 

Warrior Tabi
Executioner
Hide of the Urchin 
Witchblade 
Runeforged Hammer 
Qin Sais 

I think this is the perfect balance of defense, damage, and attack speed. It is important to have attack speed on Vamana because if you buy a creeping curse you can just simply obliterate your enemies. Then hide of the urchin corresponds with Vamana's passive so well, and Runeforged converts protection to damage which adds on to that. Hope this helped.

	<TEXT> I am all about jump parties in smite where people jump up and down before minions spawn, it is just so fun and makes the game more fun. Nothing makes me more mad then when people are jumping and some asshole comes in gun's a blazing and initiates a fight, leading to betrayal and hatred. Please, respect the jump party...do not be THAT guy. </TEXT>
