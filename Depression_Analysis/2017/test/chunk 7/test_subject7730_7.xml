	<TEXT> Did the same thing except I said "Attention Walmart shoppers. All items will be 90% percent off for the next 10 minutes. Thank you." And I watched the store turn from a place where civilians buy goods to a trackmeet of sorts in which people rushed through every isle half-jogging, grabbing what they could and sprinting to the cash register as the workers looked at each other in complete confusion. Some middle-aged man had watched me walk up, and me not wearing the typical walmart get-up...ya know the blue shirt with the khakis, and when I had finished my 'announcement' he looked me dead in the eyes while shaking his head and said "Some people just want to watch the world burn." And then he just walked away. </TEXT>
