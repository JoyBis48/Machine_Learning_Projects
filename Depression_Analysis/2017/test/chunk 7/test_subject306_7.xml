	<TEXT> Kerr is a package deal.  He's only mentioned these days b.c of his relations with Phil.  If Phil were G.M of the Warriors, I'd do in a heartbeat, bc you're getting the Triangle Offense.  Kerr by himself is not as appealing.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I know this is totally fantasy land thinking, but if Lebron wants the most rings, GS should be close to the top of the list.  He can play point, allowing Steph to be 2 guard, or play the 4 and let Bogut be the middle.  

I can't see too many other teams that could compete with that line up.  It def is a better upgrade than the current Miami squad.   </TEXT>
