They are every bit as nutty as the bible-thumpers.

	<TEXT> THANK YOU! This is exactly how I feel. I mean, come on, did anyone see anything in the example video that didn't look like debris, or floating particles, or water droplet (really? you could see the image behind it refracted upside-down), or a glare? And crop circles have been debunked over and over, and yet people still believe aliens are coming to earth to draw pictures in fields. The simplest way to quickly produce a giant image, by knocking down wheat. How easy is that? No way a human can do it? How about a group of friends looking to have fun and having the time to plan it all out? Jesus christ. </TEXT>

If they're willing to listen to others, and try to get things right, then awesome. I'll help carry them as much as possible. But the ones who won't listen (I always ask if they speak English first, just to make sure), and refuse to turn on voice to hear us (really?), yeah, I have no problem with a kick. This tour is costing me time and money, I really don't want to waste either on a fucktard.

edit: I have 41 tours, just started in Dec, have 4 aussies, and heavy like a champ. The first thing I did before playing was READ THE FORUMS. Saved me a lot of hassle, and I've only been kicked once (for AFK, but I deserved it.) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> AT T and T-Mobile GSM phones use a SIM card. Verizon CMDA phones can't have the SIM slot, so those phones are limited to pretty old models on 3G only. I'm using my old Droid X2, and from what I've gathered it's probably the best Verizon phone you can use.  
Now, I've heard more than once that some folks can get 4G Verizon phones to work, but every discussion I've had with someone from Straight Talk says otherwise.

	<TEXT> Well, the softer the material, the easier the drilling mostly. Fine silt that's highly micaceous though puffs up to the point where it seems like twice as much comes up out of the ground that what there should be. When you have to shovel spoils out of your way, it's a bit tiring. Running sands are probably the trickiest. Sand can have so much water in it that it flows. When you're drilling with hollow stem augers, it wants to flow up into them. Took a lot of headaches to figure out how to drill that. When I'm coring rock, I think limestone is the easiest. It pinnacles, so you can go in and out of it as you go down and you have to exercise extreme caution, but when coring with wireline I have the barrel spinning as fast as it can go, and can hear the rock sing. Excellent moneymaker there.  
But the easiest drilling is moist coarse silt. It isn't packed too hard in the ground, it's so soft I can almost push augers into it, and backfilling is quick and easy.

	<TEXT> A geotechnical driller's perspective...

Very generally speaking, soil, outside of rock, is really just gravel (crushed/weathered rock), sand (crushed/weathered rock and minerals), silt (crushed/weathered minerals) and clay (minerals mixed with organics).  
If you look at the particles of each type, you'll see gravels are much larger than sands, which are much larger than silts, which are much larger than clays, though silt and clay can and often do appear the same. Silt particles are generally roundish, where clay particles are flatter. If you add water to both, the soil will fall apart to nothing, but the clay adheres to itself and becomes sticky.  
Organics/peats are almost always part of the topsoil (the nutrient rich top 15 inches or so of the earth which contains the root systems of the plants in any given area.) Below this you'll really only find more than traceable amounts if there are tree roots or the earth has been disturbed or something like that.  
And then you have loam, which is really just an almost even mixture of sand, silt, and clay.  
That's most of it. What you're walking on and looking at is the topsoil. It can vary greatly, but it's pretty much gravel, sand, silt, or clay, or a mixture in whatever proportion. </TEXT>
