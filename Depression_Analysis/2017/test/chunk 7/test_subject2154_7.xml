	<TEXT> I stand corrected on that point, then. Thanks for the research and legwork, have an upvote! Although I think our attendance numbers are somewhat inflated by the fact that we do draw quite a few fans of visiting teams, mostly because SoCal is damn nice to visit. We still draw really well.

Still don't think Arte is a great owner, but I will limit my opinions to the baseball side of things.

	<TEXT> Angels fans are at best sharply divided about Moreno. He was the reason we signed Hamilton after telling Torii Hunter (who was beloved here) that we didn't have the money to resign him. He went over the head of our GM to do so, who was pretty frustrated by it. He was also the reason we ran Hamilton out of town for nothing.

We do appreciate his willingness to (EDIT: spend to) win, but the beer price thing was largely a sham. Dropped beer prices and raised parking prices in one swoop haha (EDIT: this point is largely proven wrong below, just don't want to delete it for purposes of continuity/not hiding my mistakes haha). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Point taken, I see what you're saying. You'll never hear me dismiss the value of semantics in arguments haha, don't know why that became a thing. Semantics are important.

Definitely agree that it's the obvious place to upgrade if we're going to do so. I just don't think the situation is as dire as many are making it out to be because the team as a whole has been extraordinarily unlucky so far. 

We're 29th in the league in BABIP, 1 point ahead of Boston (who was like 10 points behind us before we played them this past weekend, and they got lucky against us haha). We're hitting the ball well, it's just not getting down for some reason. 

We're also 26th in the league in defensive cluster luck (poor Oakland is in last, with luck three times as bad as ours defensively). The fact that we're still pitching pretty well is also extremely encouraging.

The fact that we're still around .500 is pretty great with regards to the luck we've had. I have faith it'll turn around, and when it does, we'll be a pretty good ballclub. </TEXT>

FTFY.

Seriously, we're ripping the ball in the past few weeks. Nothing is getting down. 29th in MLB in BABIP, one point ahead of Boston, who was like 20 points below us before our weekend series against them when they took away like 17 hits and had 28 slow rollers get through in the Sunday game alone

Yes I'm a little frustrated </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree 100%. Those ITT suggesting that we'd be willing to part with Heaney for this kind of player don't have a sense of what the organization's trajectory is, or how hard we worked to get him.

Also, I agree that Joyce will get it going, was just saying what we'd do with Revere if we got him. Joyce probably won't be great, but he can certainly produce and contribute to the team, and I think that's way more valuable than trading for a guy who's decent but not a game-changer. That's what Joyce will be, and we don't have to give up anything to get him; we already have him. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Revere profiles similarly to Aybar offensively, but with less situational hitting ability. Pretty high average but doesn't draw walks so a middling/below-average OBP. Plus he's not a good defender. He would, however, add another running threat to the order.

Ultimately, I'd want to see what we'd give up. If it's anything of consequence, I'd prefer that we didn't. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There is a significant difference between the clusterfuck that is LAX and all of those airports, so yeah, I'll take the field.

"looking at" was a colloquialism, not a literal statement. I understand that you can hear planes from all of those places; I am saying it is not anymore of a nuisance than street traffic as long as you're not right next to it, which no one would've been.

Traffic would've been a concern, yes, but with the time they had to plan it, and the lack of heavy development in the area, I'm confident they could've come up with something workable. As far as environmental costs go, that's just facetious. All of those people who need to fly are gonna fly somewhere; now they're driving to an airport further away and then taking the same flight, so a net increase in the amount of pollution, not a decrease. Unless you were just talking about the Orange County impact, which is both scientifically dubious and again, NIMBY.

Oh, money has a hand in trying to get it built, the difference is that there was also a major social benefit to having an accessible international airport in the area, far larger than that of the "huge swath of grass" that is the Great Park. So the societal benefit is far larger in that case.

And if you're really gonna go there and say that no one who doesn't live in the flight path of the airport deserves to have a say, then stop eating food from the supermarket, drinking water from the tap, using electricity...like seriously. That's not the world we live in. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> LAX Jr. is a little steep, don't you think? And there would've been an ample buffer between the closest houses and the airport; we largely would've been looking at planes flying overhead, not dealing with the takeoff noise in a game-changing amount.

And, both for Orange County in general and for the rest of southern California and the country at large, yes, you need to make a good amount of money to live in Irvine. And honestly, those of us who live in the area (I am from Irvine originally) and don't make that much money are not the people who got it killed; the people with money did. That's the point I was making with regards to money.

It just reeks of NIMBYism. Sure, fuck someone else over, but don't you dare make me deal with it. </TEXT>

If anything I'd think Iannetta being player of the game was a great thing for our chances of winning, since his baseline production has been such a black hole. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you remove the blackouts from MLB.tv, you put MLB.tv directly into competition with the regional networks who currently pay billions of dollars for their exclusive TV rights. Without blackouts, those TV rights are no longer exclusive, and you make them compete against a service that provides exactly what a large proportion of people want from their TV, which is access to the games. The value of those rights deals now plummets, and a huge slice of baseball's revenue has just cratered.

MLB.tv is not drawing in the casual fan. MLB.tv is drawing in the diehards, those of us who follow the sport as a whole, and follow it closely. You're not losing an opportunity to grow/maintain the fanbase by blacking out local games.

It does suck for certain markets, since they lie in the middle of multiple teams' broadcast areas. If anything, that's where we'll see changes. Maybe allow users to select one team at the beginning of the year that they won't be blacked out for or something. Which wouldn't solve everything, but it would help a lot. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not sure it was totally fleshed out, but it would've been on the bigger side. 

I get that, but the demand for flights in and out of the area was and is enough to fill up two airports, given the size of John Wayne and its limited hours.

The airport was killed because rich Irvine/Newport Beach residents didn't want planes flying overhead. Which frankly get over yourselves. </TEXT>

Well yeah, but viewership only makes sense if it's monetized. Online ads aren't the ticket; they can't even fill the ads up now.

	<TEXT> Those policies are not idiotic. They're inconvenient for fans. Those policies make a ton of sense, and as much as I'd like to not have them, it's hard to imagine a world where (to cite the most obvious example) MLB.tv costs as little as it does and doesn't have blackout rules. </TEXT>
