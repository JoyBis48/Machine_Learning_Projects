My problem currently, it is too easy to have one.

i'm taking a different route that takes me through a couple of nearby office buildings where i cannot smoke.

Keep that routine, i'm sure it helps a lot.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Cigarette breaks were an intermittent part of my work day.

Every job i've had let me choose when to take my breaks, didn't even matter if i went out and have a quick smoke whenever i wanted.
I've never actually tried to quit. The longest i went without a smoke was 2 days after 15 years, and that was because i was in jail. 

I have a computer in my garage for i can smoke n surf the web. Just rearranged my room to fit my desk and computer in there earlier. Desk and computer are going in tomorrow and will try to quit cold turkey. I just happened to catch your post on /r/all/new and wanted to give you support. 

Might just have to quit now since seeing your post. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> HOWEVER, the video does show several other people attempting to either get the girl off the ground (interfering in police work), or something a bit more nefarious.

Would agree the actions leading up to that point would warrant a show of force, but think he should have defended himself with pepper spray instead. He was putting himself in danger trying to detain someone that was "running their mouth."

The good news here is that no one was hurt.

Couldn't agree more

	<TEXT> Even if he is right, just shows that this community and HOA have views that go against the grain. Yes it might be private property and they had every right to call the cops. The way it was handled was the opposite of what the nation saw as right. 

The blame really comes down to the original person to tweet out that there was a pool party. A young inexperienced promoter decides to turn a private pool party into a rave and have a DJ show up? Would seem most of the blame would be on the original graduate, that lives in that community, that invited a couple friends over against the rules of that community. </TEXT>

The Games were also financially successful raising more money with fewer sponsors than any prior Olympic Games, which left SLOC with a surplus of $40 million. The surplus was used to create the Utah Athletic Foundation, which maintains and operates many of the remaining Olympic venues.

	<TEXT> Traffic on the 5 can move at a fast pace. About 10 years ago i was driving north to see some friends. Had a corvette pass me doing about 100 so i sped up and just matched his pace. We probably went 50 miles at that speed, granted i had a radar detector and i guess he did as well. The vette crested a hill and immediately started to slow down, as soon as i crested i got a laser warning. After we were out of view we sped back up again.

I've even seen packs of 5+ cars being pulled over by a single CHP before. </TEXT>
