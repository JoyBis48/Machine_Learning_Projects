	<TEXT> My wife is Korean.  We've been married 29 years.  She still can't say "I love you".  She can say "love you", or "i love", but not all 3 words.  She said it's a Korean thing.  I had to teach her how to hug and kiss the children when they were young.  She said her father never hugged her growing up. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> a colleague's ex wife lived there after the divorce (for about a year).  She said it's infested with druggies, drunks and old people.  avoid it if you can

If you're looking for affordable, yet not too bad, check out:

1.  Belchertown - yeah it's more pricey now than it was 10 years ago, but just a step down from Amherst.

2.  South Hadley - you can find something foreclosed look on Zillow for the latest.  It's a typical new england town full of rednecks and nimby's, but a nice place to live.

3.  Turner's Falls/Montague - yeah there's drugs up there, also poverty, but it's turning around.  Has a nice artist community and is relatively safe.

4.  Shelburne/Buckland - pretty far from everything, but if you don't care about that it's a great place to live

5.  Leeds/Williamsburg/Goshen - see what you can find for housing.  Sometimes you luck out.  Pricier than Belchertown, but close to Northampton.

Places to stay away from:

1.  Ware/Three Rivers/Palmer/Ludlow 

2.  Springfield/West Springfield

3.  Agawam/Westfield

Good luck! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I play a mandola.  The stretch is not much more than a mandolin.  I can stretch to the 7th fret without too much trouble.

I own two mandolas.  One is a Hora, made in Romania.  Not very nice, about the same price as the truly mediocre Trinity College.  The other is a Big Muddy/Mid Missouri which is a little better, but not much better.  Look around on Craigslist, sometimes you can find a Gibson mandola for around $1800 or so.  I've seen them as low as $900 with some slight damage.

Another idea for you is mandocello.  Of course it's significantly different than a mandolin in every possible way, but closer to a bass. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was one of the first few hundred users of reddit...came here from Fark actually, I can't remember when it was, probably 8 or 9 years ago.  Anyway, I've had 5 accounts banned so far.  I'm actually surprised this one hasn't been banned yet.  It certainly is on some kind of a list, however, because I can't post to certain subreddits, and have to wait 9 minutes to post or comment in others.

So what you do is set up multiple accounts based on what your interests are.  Install a VPN like Tunnelbear and use different browsers, clear your cookies each time.

Or leave.

Also, in answer to your other question: I'm not in Korea, so no.  But it is on the news here in western Mass, which if you think about it, is pretty incredible.  I mean, we're a tiny fraction of the state...yet we get coverage about the MERS situation in Korea.

	<TEXT> I'm an ER doctor in western Massachusetts (USA).  This outbreak was caused by someone with an attitude like yours.  This man, an elderly doctor, didn't follow universal protocols when he returned from a trip overseas, ignored his own symptoms when they began to present themselves, and was part of a system that preferred to ignore/hide a potential threat rather than treat it seriously.

Is it warranted to say that the Korean culture is largely responsible for this outbreak?  Probably not, but it certainly is a contributing factor. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The only people infected so far were patients or visitors of the major hospitals where the vector went originally.  The problem is, it has a 10-15 day incubation period, which means most of those people could very well have already infected someone else.  I think they've quarantined most of the exposed people, but some have slipped through the cracks of course.

I suspect if you stay out of the hospitals, was your hands and don't touch anybody else you don't know, you'll be fine. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Because we have this thing called "affirmative action" where if you are of an ethnic minority, you get preferential placement in most publicly held positions (police, fire, education, hospital, government, etc).  I don't mean to sound racist here, but that is why most of the people you see working in government offices are black women, two categories given priority over every other one.
