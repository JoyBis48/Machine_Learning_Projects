	<TEXT> This is quite heavy for its appearance--not sure what any of it is, most curious if that's ruby since it's been found near where I was (other corundum as well)--not sure what the black is or the white either. How would I carefully expose the red/ruby/garnet, whatever it is? So appreciative of this resource--learn a lot, but confused myself on this one. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What was strange to me that when she asked why keep it all centrally located when risk would be centralized too (since he's planning to use it for currency trading) he said BECAUSE of Linpack. That was his only reason. She was just silent a minute like "ummm" ....then it got stranger. I don't know if she just had him on for the sake of amusement (all of the Wire podcasts are with reputable people this is an anomaly) or what but I am mystified by almost everything he said. He doesn't sound like someone who understands a single thing about HPC. </TEXT>
