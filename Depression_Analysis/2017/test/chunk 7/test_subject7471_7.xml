	<TEXT> The animals being raised for food suffer immensely, and there are far more of them suffering and dying each year than there are dogs and cats that we care for. If you care about animals it only makes sense to address the area where the vast majority of animals are suffering.

If you don't think you can go 100% vegetarian right away then you can still cut out most of the meat you are eating from your diet. Tell your parents that you would like to avoid meat, and they will likely be more accommodating too. Even when you are eating out or with friends you will be surprised by how often you can find meat-free options if you look for them. You can easily have a huge impact in lessening animal suffering with only a minor effort to choose more animal-friendly options.

Finally, keep in mind that you can stop eating meat, and don't hesitate to go fully vegetarian when you are ready. You may find that many of your peers are already doing it! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ultimately ethical veganism is a boycott intended to lessen the demand for animal products. Other animals do not possess all of the capacities that a typical human would have, but they show responses that appear quite similar to our own reactions to suffering when treated in many of the ways that would cause us to suffer.

[Utilitarianism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilitarianism) is a common school of ethical thought amongst vegans. Utilitarians view an action as good if it maximizes the amount of goodness (generally judged as increasing pleasure or happiness, and minimizing pain or suffering) that is expected to occur as a result. While many ethical vegans will openly admit that they enjoy the taste of meat (evidenced by the numerous meat alternatives available for vegans today), they recognize that the harm caused to other animals to produce these products almost certainly exceeds the pleasure they gain as a result. The boycott that is veganism lessens demand for these products, and correspondingly supply will decrease as a result.

Another way of expressing this is in the principle of [equal consideration of interests](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_consideration_of_interests). That is to say that the interest of any individual should be given equal consideration where, and to the extent that the interest exists. This isn't to say that all interests are equal, experienced equally, or that all animals possess interests, but that where there are interests, we should weight that interest proportionally to the intensity of the interest and not discriminate on any other basis. </TEXT>

Other animals are individuals with lives and desires of their own that ought to be respected. A vegan is only going to speak up to the extent that someone's actions are violating another individual's rights. This meme clearly demonstrates a gross misunderstanding of the issue at hand. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Full Quote:

Just how destructive does a culinary preference have to be before we decide to eat something else? If contributing to the suffering of billions of animals that live miserable lives and (quite often) die in horrific ways isn't motivating, what would be? If being the number one contributor to the most serious threat facing the planet (global warming) isn't enough, what is? And if you are tempted to put off these questions of conscience, to say not now, then when?

	<TEXT> Nothing I do is all that hard. Everyone here could be doing exactly what I do. There are plenty of other redditors that have more karma than I do (for now).

As far as tools go, I use a tool called [Reddit Scheduler](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/reddit-scheduler/ekdpobinhbpdigokooncmmmamhmjfigl?hl=en) to get links to post at the times I want them to. It gets the job done 80% of the time, but 20% it will mess something up and not post anything else until I uninstall and reinstall it. It is also generally inconvenient to use, but it is the only thing I have found for making a lot of posts to reddit at the times I want. It would save me some trouble if someone made something better.

I also use [Reddit Later](http://www.redditlater.com/analysis/) to tell me when the best times to submit to a subreddit is. Unfortunately it just looks at when the most popular posts were submitted, which is a bit different from what time I should submit a link to get the most karma. It also tends to have a small sample size for a lot of subreddit since it only looks at posts since the first of the month. Improving upon this tool would also help. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> **[American Dietetic Association](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19562864)**

 It is the position of the American Dietetic Association that appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases. Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence, and for athletes.

**[Dietitians of Canada](http://www.dietitians.ca/Nutrition-Resources-A-Z/Factsheets/Vegetarian/Eating-Guidelines-for-Vegans.aspx)**

 A well planned vegan diet can meet all of these needs. It is safe and healthy for pregnant and breastfeeding women, babies, children, teens and seniors.

**[The British National Health Service](http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/Vegetarianhealth/Pages/Vegandiets.aspx)**

 With good planning and an understanding of what makes up a healthy, balanced vegan diet, you can get all the nutrients your body needs.

**[The British Nutrition Foundation](http://www.nutrition.org.uk/publications/briefingpapers/vegetarian-nutrition)**

 A well-planned, balanced vegetarian or vegan diet can be nutritionally adequate ... Studies of UK vegetarian and vegan children have revealed that their growth and development are within the normal range.

**[The Dietitians Association of Australia](http://daa.asn.au/for-the-public/smart-eating-for-you/nutrition-a-z/vegan-diets/)**

 Vegan diets are a type of vegetarian diet, where only plant-based foods are eaten. They differ to other vegetarian diets in that no animal products are usually consumed or used. Despite these restrictions, with good planning it is still possible to obtain all the nutrients required for good health on a vegan diet.

**[The United States Department of Agriculture](http://www.choosemyplate.gov/healthy-eating-tips/tips-for-vegetarian.html)**

 Vegetarian diets (*see context*) can meet all the recommendations for nutrients. The key is to consume a variety of foods and the right amount of foods to meet your calorie needs. Follow the food group recommendations for your age, sex, and activity level to get the right amount of food and the variety of foods needed for nutrient adequacy. Nutrients that vegetarians may need to focus on include protein, iron, calcium, zinc, and vitamin B12.

**[The National Health and Medical Research Council](http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/_files_nhmrc/publications/attachments/n55a_australian_dietary_guidelines_summary_130530.pdf)**

 Alternatives to animal foods include nuts, seeds, legumes, beans and tofu. For all Australians,
these foods increase dietary variety and can provide a valuable, affordable source of protein
and other nutrients found in meats. These foods are also particularly important for those who
follow vegetarian or vegan dietary patterns. Australians following a vegetarian diet can still meet nutrient requirements if energy needs are met and the appropriate number and variety of serves from the Five Food Groups are eaten throughout the day. For those eating a vegan diet, supplementation of B12 is recommended.

**[The Mayo Clinic](http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-living/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/vegetarian-diet/art-20046446)**

  A well-planned vegetarian diet (*see context*) can meet the needs of people of all ages, including children, teenagers, and pregnant or breast-feeding women. The key is to be aware of your nutritional needs so that you plan a diet that meets them.

**[The Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada](http://www.heartandstroke.com/site/c.ikIQLcMWJtE/b.3484249/k.2F6C/Healthy_living__Vegetarian_diets.htm)**

 Vegetarian diets (*see context*) can provide all the nutrients you need at any age, as well as some additional health benefits. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The majority of soy and corn being grown today is fed to livestock. You can't get more calories out of a slaughtered animal than you fed to it originally.

	<TITLE> "There are barbarians who seize this dog, nail him down to a table and dissect him alive! You discover in him all the same organs of feeling as in yourself. Answer me, Mechanist, has Nature arranged all the springs of feeling in this animal to the end that he might not feel?" -Voltaire </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Full Quote:

Hold then the same view of the dog which has lost his master, which has sought him in all the thoroughfares with cries of sorrow, which comes into the house troubled and restless, goes downstairs, goes upstairs; goes from room to room, finds at last in his study the master he loves, and betokens his gladness by soft whimpers, frisks, and caresses. 

There are barbarians who seize this dog, who so greatly surpasses man in fidelity and friendship, and nail him down to a table and dissect him alive, to show you the Mesaraic veins! You discover in him all the same organs of feeling as in yourself. Answer me, Mechanist, has Nature arranged all the springs of feeling in this animal to the end that he might not feel? Has he nerves that he may be incapable of suffering? Do not suppose that impertinent contradiction in Nature.

-Voltaire, *Dictionnaire philosophique portatif* (1764)

Explanation: In the 17th Century, Ren Descartes had advocated the idea that animals were mere automatons, or complex machines, and that lacking a soul they could not suffer. Followers of Descartes ideas, who Voltaire and others referred to as Mechanists, conducted gruesome experiments on animals with little consideration for the unimaginable misery the animals were forced to endure. The quote above was Voltaires response to those who were conducting these experiments with no consideration for the well-being of the animals involved. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There have been many times when scientific ideas have been censored in a similar fashion because people didn't like the conclusions. Far too many people today view philosophy as mere opinions, but whether they like it or not there are factual statements that can be made about individual wellbeing and the consequences our actions have upon others. Not everyone will agree with Singer's views, but he at least makes a good attempt to back up his views with solidly supported evdence on what the consequences of our actions will be, and is open to being shown that he is wrong if better evidence suggests otherwise. Censoring a world-renowned philosopher like Singer is a disappointing short term setback for philosophy, but as we have seen with controversial science, even with strong opposition accurate ideas win out in the end. </TEXT>

Every single time they come back with video showing horrifying conditions and terrible mistreatment. Even the industry acknowledges that mutilations like dehorning, debeaking, tail docking, and castration all without anesthesia are common. We know that many animals are kept in battery cages and gestation crates and those that aren't are rarely afforded much more space. Nobody should be able to buy these products anymore without acknowledging that they are paying to support animal cruelty. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You continue repeating those same poorly designed studies and misrepresenting the conclusions of others despite being shown the flaws several times.

There is overwhelming consensus among dietary experts that appropriately planned vegetarian and vegan diets are healthy for all stages of life. You are like someone who keeps pointing to "gaps" in the fossil record as evidence that evolution did not occur.

**[American Dietetic Association](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19562864)**

 It is the position of the American Dietetic Association that appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases. Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence, and for athletes.

**[Dietitians of Canada](http://www.dietitians.ca/Nutrition-Resources-A-Z/Factsheets/Vegetarian/Eating-Guidelines-for-Vegans.aspx)**

 A well planned vegan diet can meet all of these needs. It is safe and healthy for pregnant and breastfeeding women, babies, children, teens and seniors.

**[The British National Health Service](http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/Vegetarianhealth/Pages/Vegandiets.aspx)**

 With good planning and an understanding of what makes up a healthy, balanced vegan diet, you can get all the nutrients your body needs.

**[The British Nutrition Foundation](http://www.nutrition.org.uk/publications/briefingpapers/vegetarian-nutrition)**

 A well-planned, balanced vegetarian or vegan diet can be nutritionally adequate ... Studies of UK vegetarian and vegan children have revealed that their growth and development are within the normal range.

**[The Dietitians Association of Australia](http://daa.asn.au/for-the-public/smart-eating-for-you/nutrition-a-z/vegan-diets/)**

 Vegan diets are a type of vegetarian diet, where only plant-based foods are eaten. They differ to other vegetarian diets in that no animal products are usually consumed or used. Despite these restrictions, with good planning it is still possible to obtain all the nutrients required for good health on a vegan diet.

**[The United States Department of Agriculture](http://www.choosemyplate.gov/healthy-eating-tips/tips-for-vegetarian.html)**

 Vegetarian diets (*see context*) can meet all the recommendations for nutrients. The key is to consume a variety of foods and the right amount of foods to meet your calorie needs. Follow the food group recommendations for your age, sex, and activity level to get the right amount of food and the variety of foods needed for nutrient adequacy. Nutrients that vegetarians may need to focus on include protein, iron, calcium, zinc, and vitamin B12.

**[The National Health and Medical Research Council](http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/_files_nhmrc/publications/attachments/n55a_australian_dietary_guidelines_summary_130530.pdf)**

 Alternatives to animal foods include nuts, seeds, legumes, beans and tofu. For all Australians,
these foods increase dietary variety and can provide a valuable, affordable source of protein
and other nutrients found in meats. These foods are also particularly important for those who
follow vegetarian or vegan dietary patterns. Australians following a vegetarian diet can still meet nutrient requirements if energy needs are met and the appropriate number and variety of serves from the Five Food Groups are eaten throughout the day. For those eating a vegan diet, supplementation of B12 is recommended.

**[The Mayo Clinic](http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-living/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/vegetarian-diet/art-20046446)**

  A well-planned vegetarian diet (*see context*) can meet the needs of people of all ages, including children, teenagers, and pregnant or breast-feeding women. The key is to be aware of your nutritional needs so that you plan a diet that meets them.

**[The Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada](http://www.heartandstroke.com/site/c.ikIQLcMWJtE/b.3484249/k.2F6C/Healthy_living__Vegetarian_diets.htm)**

 Vegetarian diets (*see context*) can provide all the nutrients you need at any age, as well as some additional health benefits. </TEXT>
