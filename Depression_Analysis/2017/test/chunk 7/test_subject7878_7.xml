	<TEXT>  Has she always been a lazy kid - who doesn't see any reason to put in more than minimal effort?

Yes.

 Are you (as parents) or her siblings high acheivers? Is there pressure to be an achiever? is she rebelling against pressure or expectations that either she doesn't want or feels she can't meet?

We just expect her to do her work, and show actual effort in her studies.  That is lacking.

 Have you had her tested for a learning disability? Do you see times when she is absolutely able to do well if she applies herself?

She was tested for ADD/ADHD, and the test shown borderline minimal results.  Those times are few and far between.

 Is her personality counter to school culture - is she a free spirited, creative kid who doesn't like too much structure or being put in a box? Is she more hands on ?

She is very hands-on.

 What are her talents, hobbies, interests? When do you see her really engage in something? What does she enjoy? Where does she put effort?

She doesn't really have any REAL hobbies that she gets truly engaged into... unless texting/video-chatting on her friggin' phone is considered a hobby.

 Does she see any connection between school and her life? Any ideas what she wants to do after high school? Any older kids who she knows that have gone on to college?

She says she does. Says she wants to go to college. Apparently is now interested in photography (since she shows no signs of taking photos).  She has an older cousin attending LSU right now.

 Is she engaged at school outside of academics? Strong circle of friends? gets along with teachers? Involved in clubs, sports, teams or other school related extracurriculars?

She has had her extracurricular activities taken away as punishment for grades.  She has only one REAL friend...

 How is she mood wise? Lots of teen angst? Any signs of depression? Does she want to e Goth or emo or non mainstream in her self-expression?

Aside from treating me like a stereotypical step-daughter treats her step-father; no. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The teachers were willing to help a lot in her 6th-8th grade levels.  Now, everything is on her school-provided distraction (i.e., required laptop).  While she's "doing her homework" (i.e., watching YouTube, chatting with friends, etc.), we assume she's doing her homework.

Her teachers view the students as being to be responsible by this age (which they should), and will sort of help with large assignments if asked, but not day-to-day homework. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Poor Grades vs. Tuition </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-05-21 19:01:30 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Scenario: 15yo daughter just completed her freshman year at a private, Catholic school costing $8k a year.  Showed little to no initiative in schoolwork, constantly got zeroes on homework, poor grades on tests, let to failing one class and barely getting C's and D's in others.

Tuition is going up to $8.5k next year, and I argue for taking her out of the school since it's practically a waste of money. 

My wife argues to keep her in because it's a better education than the public schools in East Baton Rouge (Louisiana) Parish.

I counter-argue that it's not a better education if she's not getting anything from it anyway because she simply doesn't care, and constantly complains about how hard it is.

___________________
What is the better solution?

HELP!
___________________
*Edit: Thanks for all the comments.  This is an issue we've been struggling with for a few years.  Any time we try to determine why, all we get is either, "I don't know," or, "It's just how I am."*

1. /u/SteveHarveysSuit -- I'm not sure we know exactly what she'd want.  She's all about social, so I'd be willing to bet she'd pick staying just to not have to make friends all over again.

2.  /u/NovelTeach and /u/dmf95742 -- She makes no money to pay for anything.  That would require a job.  We tried the F = -$10; D = -$5; C = $0; B = +$5; and A = +$10 for report cards, but when the negatives outweigh the positives, it became pointless.

3. /u/flakemasterflake -- She doesn't seem to care about peer pressure... at least academically. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It sounds like you rushed into RCIA before you were ready. I was raised Assemblies of God.  I attended Catholic mass for two years before going through RCIA.  

I spoke to many Catholics about many things. You need to find a few solid Catholics, and just talk with them a while.  We all go through it.

I too struggled with masturbation. Not so much a problem now that I'm married. Hehe.  That one is tough.  I'd suggest /r/NoFap for support on that one.

Talk to priest or deacon you trust. Get counseling sessions set up.  I'm sure they'd work with you.

Side-Note: I believe that homosexuality itself is not a sin. Acting on the sexual urges, and therefore committing fornication/adultery, is the sin. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Flat tax on purchased goods ***only***.

Someone making $30k a year might spend $200-$300 month on food.  9% tax on that is only $27.  They might buy a $5k used car.  9% tax on that is $450.

Someone making $100k a year might spend $1200 a month on food.  9% tax on that is $108.  They might buy an $85k new car.  9% tax on that is $7,650!

tl;dr :: Rich people buy more (and more expensive) things than poor people.  It's fair.
