	<TEXT> *All the Light We Cannot See* by Anthony Doerr


From this [interview](http://www.powells.com/blog/interviews/anthony-doerr-the-powells-com-interview-by-jill/) -

DOERR: Good, good! Certainly even though the book looks thick, I think the pages are friendly to readers because there's a lot of white space. I think you can actually turn the pages quickly. My prose can be dense. I love to pile on detail. I love to describe. I'm much more reluctant to give the reader entrance into a character's feeling than describe what's around him or her and have the reader intuit the internal life of a character. I know that's demanding, so this was a gesture of friendliness, maybe. It's like I'm saying to the reader, "I know this is going to be more lyrical than maybe 70 percent of American readers want to see, but here's a bunch of white space for you to recover from that lyricism." </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Yes blacks in America had it rough. But with the passing of each year it falls deeper into the past and becomes less relevant.

Did you watch the news at all in the past year? What you are saying is patently wrong.

 I used to like NPR but their daily hour of skin color talk and articles is sickening.

Imagine being black and having to deal with it all the time?

 No one is stopping black people from writing books. And patting those who do on the head is patronizing and segregatory. When I read a book the author's skin color has nothing to do with how I feel about the book.

Not the point, and handwaving away actual issues that black authors have to deal with. From the article:
 Nearly twenty years later, that prejudice abounds: Whitewashed covers, hostile dismissals of "identity politics" and "political correctness" as a barely-veiled attempt to silence us, all-white panels on diversity, all-white anthologies of "the best" science fiction, and continual institutional barriers to traditional publication based on appeals to marketability that really reflect the publishing houses' disbelief in the power and appeal of black storytelling. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not so much the ideas, but the impact. When I finished reading the book, my initial thoughts of the book were very lukewarm. An OK read, not sure it was worth the hype. Despite my initial reaction, I found myself fondly thinking of it often the next few weeks. Ended up rereading The Airborne toxic event chapters and enjoyed it a lot more the second time </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Unpopular opinion here, but I really hated this book. Found it vaguely interesting at first, but as the book progressed there are just a ton of infodumps, and I started getting very bored. I didn't find it funny at all either, just totally didn't mesh with my sort of humor. Also has one of the worst sex scenes ever written </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Cool, that rarely happens and that made me smile.

I can see how he could come off as obnoxious, but stuff like directing As I Lay Dying and Child of God made me respect him, and I've seen him supporting lesser known works like *Scarecrone* by Melissa Broder and *Black Cloud* by Juliet Escoria on his social media. Plus I like his stoner movies :)

	<TEXT> Reading to your kids is so important. There's really zero excuse not to do it. Start the day you bring them home from the hospital. Even something like *Goodnight Moon* or *Hop on Pop* teaches them so much - letter recognition, memorization, vocabulary, phrases, and more. Make sure you interact with them while reading too! Don't just drone on. Ask them questions, have them point things out to you, make it even more fun for them. </TEXT>
