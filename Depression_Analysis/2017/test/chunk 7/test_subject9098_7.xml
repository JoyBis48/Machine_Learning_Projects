	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So during the race today my brother thought of something in regards to NASCAR's new rule that drivers give 100% effort all the time.  With the restrictor plate race some drivers say that their plan is to stay in the back until the end of the race.  By doing this aren't they actually giving less than 100% effort to try to win the race?  So shouldn't that driver get a penalty for doing this?  Just curious what your thoughts are about this. </TEXT>

They can go on to win 6 of the remaining Chase races and it won't matter because they were already elimited from something out of their control.  Besides, with the points structure there's already an elimination factor with the Chase.  It just takes several races to get into it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So I just watched Arlington Road for the first time last night.  Overall I enjoyed the movie and think I understand pretty much everything that happened.  I just have 1 question though.  At the end of the movie, how does the bomb get into the trunk of Jeff Bridges rental car?  Did Tim Robbins know which car he was going to get and had it planted in the trunk beforehand?  Because I believe the only scene where Jeff Bridges isn't in the car is when he's fighting Tim Robbins in the warehouse building.  But I doubt that would have been when they planted it in the car. </TEXT>
