	<TEXT> I think he did a really great job of sidestepping questions where Katie was trying to get him to take a shot at Hillary. I know that as a reporter it's her job to ask those questions and I don't fault her for that, but I'm proud that he was able to address those questions by keeping the interview about his policy views and his campaign rather than focusing on where another candidate stands. That's the kind of honest, clean campaign that all of Bernie's doubters need to see.  </TEXT>
