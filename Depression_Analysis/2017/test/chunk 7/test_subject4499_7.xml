After reading this now I'm a little worried. Should I consult a doctor? I understand it's on me for not doing my research and trusting my sister who raised three boys.

	<TEXT> CTF narrative from last night:

Red team up by one, I was playing defence with sniper. Team was having a hard time, abandoned post. Go hard after their flag, get it out of base, ours gets taken, I die, spawn, kill their carrier, return flag, team mates cap ours. 1-1, 4 minutes left, red team flogging us hard, I play defence with carbine on flag. Kill lots of them, they back off for a little bit, I jump on the mongoose and fly into their base, die immediately, repeat that 3 more times, 4th time in base, had enough back up to get the flag just outside of the door. Red plays major defence, everyone on our team continuously dies to touch the flag, catch a break and get it past the half way point. Clock is at 30 seconds left of overtime. Entire red team killing our carriers, not even 10 seconds left we get it in our base during a repetitive massacre. Every single one of us marched into the gun fire to pull that flag closer. 2-1 win for us.

First time I laid my controller down and exclaimed happiness aloud since halo 3. It almost seemed like everyone was playing to win for once. Something I rarely ever experience in halo 4. So much fucking fun. </TEXT>
