	<TEXT> oh cool, thanks!  checking them out...for some reason kinda reminds me of Washed Out though they don't really sound the same.  Maybe it's just that immersive wall of sound. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Samuel T. Herring's stage presence is captivating...not sure I've seen anything else like it recently.  Check out their 2014 performance on Austin City Limits:

	<TEXT> I was getting scintillating scotomas for a while over the past 5 years...shortly after moving to California from New England.  This is the first time I've found someone else who gets them.  Mine almost always would develop into a migraine, followed by nausea and then vomiting.   Super sucky.  However in the last year, I've greatly reduced their occurrence, mainly through stress reduction (they always coincided w stress and glare from sunlight).  Sorry for the overshare, just excited to meet someone else who has experienced this. </TEXT>
