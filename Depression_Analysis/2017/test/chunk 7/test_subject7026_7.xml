	<TEXT> Hard Countering Snipers isn't that bad when you consider that Sniper hard counters Medic/Engineer/Scout/Non-DDS Snipers/Uncloaked Spies. Then you give Sniper a bottle of Piss and the Bushwhacka and he counters anyone that feels like whipping out the Melee of their choice for a friendly game of "Let's fight with swords n shit".  
  
Vaccinator isn't even that good anyway so it basically *only* counters Sniper in that regard, denying Kritz doesn't deny damage. Just shoot an extra rocket at the nerd and he's gone. Use some communication to tell your team that the other Medic has Vax and then wait for the Med to go down before popping your Kritz.  
  
It's not bullshit to good players, only bad players have issues with enemy gamers using this. For example; You. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A combination of both, every class has a specific role to fill and can fill it perfectly. Scout does the best job at making giant robots easy to kill and can collect money, Valve even made the Scout the money class by giving him health for collecting cash. Soldier gets easy damage and can work crowd control + the tank, the Buff Banner allows for extra damage on everything. Demo can kill uber Medics by right clicking. Heavy is just a Heavy, easy damage. Engineer kills anything not hit by the players with his sentry. Medic has a shield that prevents all incoming damage and has Kritz for easy kills.

!rtd  

"How can you come on to a Valve server and think there are plugins? They are very clearly organised by Alphabetical order, y'know A B C D-" Then I do the rest. I know they're probably orded by ping or players, but this is a Nic Cage quote so it's more embarrassing for them.  
omg why isn't rtd working  

I stole the declaration of independence and it said in the fine print that !rtd is only to be used while not in use of other players.

	<TEXT> It's a poorly written pornographic anime about a guy who sees a young girl but SUPRISE it's a young boy. Like a 10 year old boy. They fuck in the back of a car, then the first kid sees another kid and they watch the second kid's sister use a banana for something other than eating, then they fuck in the attic. Then there's a transgender kid or something and they all fuck on top of a tower.  
  
The End. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Check how many people are dead, if it's not many you go to the field, but with 5 dead, you need to sit and wait. Also check the classes dead and alive, if there's a Scout down you should start to leave, you will be outrun unless they are BFB or you are Quickfix meaning you won't give them the full buff of hp when they're at the fight.  
  
I personally pocket my friend because I know he's good, so I sit and wait for him. In a game without a friend to work with you should normally be going to the fight.

	<TEXT> Guys just grab the Overdose, it may be a piece of trash but if you just killed a Scout or something with the Ubersaw and you're at 100% all by yourself, you can run slightly faster to get to a team member to heal them. The damage penalty is like 10% which is maybe 3 hp per syringe, I wouldn't know because I use the Crossbow, but it's so much better than the stock and the Blutsager. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Left mouse and Right mouse attack, secondary attack is bound to mouse 3.  
  
I'd use the worst weapons in the game, Sun on a Stick and the Sharpened Volcano Fragment. Amazing combo with the effects of both working together.  
  
Another viable option would be The Butterfly Knife and the Sandman, hit the guy with the ball then start torrenting anime to spike your ping so you can facestab everyone in the server. </TEXT>
