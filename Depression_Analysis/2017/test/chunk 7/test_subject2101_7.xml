	<TEXT> To additionally try and quell your disbelief of my story: This was 20 some-odd years ago.  IIRC, ferries out of Hyannis (to Nantucket Island) were halted because of ~20ft swells.  However,  Nantucket Airlines (think the TV show "Wings") was still willing to fly.  The dual prop -as I remember it- sat ~6-8 people behind the 'cockpit' seats.  It was an open cabin, and you could elect to sit up-front next to the pilot if you wanted to.  There was no divider of any kind.  I had never been in an airplane like it before (or since), so I opted to do it (no one else wanted to).  It was fascinating, but I had no idea what I was in for, and had no idea just how precarious the weather in the sky really was.  It scared the crap out of me at the time.  The pilot told me not to touch anything, but I totally had a steering wheel-like device floating back and forth in front of me - doing all the same movements as the pilots one.

Nantucket was awesome.  The weather cleared the following day, and I lived  delusionally like a king for about a week, playing about in the vicinity of some ridiculously rich people.

Bonus story you can choose to believe or not:  Don't disturb nesting seagulls out in Coatue refuge.  They will dive bomb/shit on you!  I got chased down a beach for about a quarter mile before they stopped trying to shit bomb me.  Running top-speed in soft sand dunes is a real PITA.

I didn't know I invaded their space, but they sure didn't care.  I wouldn't even know if you can still go out there like I did back then, but at the time you could take any vehicle out there that had ....  "dunes pass"?  or something like that.  The rich people I was a guest of had one on their old beat-up Jeep Cherokee, and so I went out there at their suggestion.  Note: You have to heavily deflate your tires or you *will* get stuck out there.   I got stuck twice and had to keep deflating as well as use wood blanks that were in the back/trunk (it seemed like excessive deflation, but it was eventually the only thing that worked).  The entry to the dunes/refuge areas had air pumps (and deflation/pressure guages) for [de/re]-inflating your tires when you got went in/out.  Totally weird for a "city boy" like me, but it was an awesome adventure.

I dont know if the above is still possible, but it was absolutely true ~20 years ago.  I took the ferry back to Hyannis when it was over. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I took-off in a small dual-prop aircraft in high-winds once.  As soon as the wheel lost tracktion with the runway, we were pushed sideways about 30 feet.  The entire flight (to an island) we had to fly with heavy skew? into the wind to fight the push.  Being a small plane, it felt like we were flying at a 45 degree angle the entire time.  Bonus: Being a small plane, I had the luck of getting to sit up-front with the pilot and got to see everything that was going on really well, and the fight that the pilot had with the plane the entire time.

You can imagine what the landing was like...   coming in, pointing away from the runway at an angle to fight the wind - but moving straight toward it - and really fast.  The pilot wanted ground asap.  As soon as the wheels get traction, the plain swings abruptly straight - like you just got... umm...  I really cant compare it to anything else.  It was the oddest sensation of a big shove with a straighten your shit out attitude attached from mothernature. It was fucking terrifying.

I will never fly under those circumstances again. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'll never understand these passive agressive posts.  If there is an open seat next to you, would you not put you bag on it instead of the floor or your lap?

As an adult, I would expect other adults to be fully capable of asking me to move my belongings - for which I happily would.  If I saw a child or an elderly person, I would move them myself and invite said person to sit. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This goes to show how narrow the roads are.  If there arent lanes, then it is a very fucking narrow road.  There are many CA mountain roads do not have lanes.  Many dont have lines.  It all depends on how remote you go.

These bike riders are idiots driving at those speeds on such a narrow mountain pass. </TEXT>
