	<TEXT> Nope, your trading the number 1 pick for like a 3rd rounder(8 man league). Pitching is replaceable, elite hitting isn't. Why does it have to be Felix? There's plenty of productive pitchers you can buy low on right now. Chris sale is probably going to dominate tonight, trade some schmo for him before his start. </TEXT>
