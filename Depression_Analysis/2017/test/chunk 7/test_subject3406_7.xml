	<TITLE> Does a new Retina MacBook Pro require a magsafe adapter for use with a power adapter from early 2011? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-09-21 00:36:00 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi all. I apologize in advance if this is a dumb question. I have a 17" MacBook Pro from early 2011 that is dying. Sadly, it's out of warranty now and the logic board is going. A $350-500 repair did not seem to make sense, so I bought a 15" MacBook Pro that should be arriving early next week.

I'll still have my power adapters for my 17" MBP that I was planning on using with the new one as my travel power cord (lives in backpack) and my alternate location power cord. BUT-I was in the Apple Store the other day and saw a box for a Magsafe to Magsafe 2 adapter, and the picture in the back looks like the power cords I have currently (no pun intended!). I asked the salesperson if I'd need these to use my old power cords with the new MBP, he looked at me blankly, went off to ask someone else, and told me no, I wouldn't, but I'm a little hesitant to trust his answer.

Thoughts? (And thanks!) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I wouldn't necessarily rely on your home insurance. Not only is it a 1k deductible, but a claim could lead to your insurance getting canceled. You might want to ask your insurance company if you can get a personal article policy. That might be what you already asked about and were told was only for camera gear? I have one through State Farm for about $70 a year. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'd point to some of the oral argument in Wurie last term as an example of the Supreme Court being incredibly out of touch with technology and the real world. Chief Justice Roberts made it clear he thought having multiple cell phones was a sign of being a drug dealer, and Scalia's quip supported that notion. (page 49 of http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/13-212_86qd.pdf )

Which I suppose means that every Big Law and government lawyer I know with a work cell phone and a personal cell phone are suspicious in Roberts's and Scalia's eyes. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There are a lot of people in this thread castigating the sheriff for his mistake. I suggest that before you call the sherif a murderer or evil or cruel, etc., please read Gene Weingarten's piece from 2009 on parents who forgot their children in hot cars. It's not a black and white issue of good and evilthe importance of a human or canine life does not make our brains any better at remembering their location or condition than it does the keys, phones, and wallets that people lose on a daily basis. The tragedy of these situations shouldn't be compounded by criminal charges in instances where it was a genuine, awful but genuine, mistake.

	<TEXT> No, it's a reasonable question. If a smartphone or watch ("device") is tied to the same account as a smartcard, it would be possible to use a device to enter/exit the station that is part of the pilot, and use one's smartcard to enter/exit at stations that are not. This would expand the usefulness of the test program.

If, on the other hand, payment via device is treated as a new, separate account, the way a separate smartrip card would be, that's unhelpful to most of us. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This.....is not true. The exact specifics differ from state to state, but generally, defamation (of which slander and libel are subparts) is a untruth about another person which harms the defamed person's reputation.

Actual malice is only generally required if a person is a public figure. A supermarket manager is not.

The question isn't whether OP could sue for defamation. He could. The questions are a: whether he could prove it (probably); and b: whether there was any actual harm to his reputation to the point that he could recover enough $ to make it worth his while. That's a question for a local attorney familiar with the laws of his state, should he choose to pursue it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Horse pucky. The FAA case didn't involve some nebulous concept of "guidelines"it involved the Administrative Procedures Act (APA), a federal statute that applies to the actions of agencies if there is no other statute controlling. It's essentially the default if no special procedures, forms, hearings, etc. are laid out in an agency-specific statute. And it is entirely a federal statuteit has no direct bearing on state administrative agencies.

New York has its own statute, the State Administrative Procedure Act. It certainly embodies many of the concepts of the federal APA, but it is by no means a mirror. (See Bonfield, Arthur Earl, "The Federal APA and State Administrative Law," 72 Va. L. Rev. 297 (March, 1986)). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As Breez_E said, every house is different. Some houses are very alcohol focused. A few are drug focused. Some revolve around a sport. Some are LGBQT friendly. There are the coed houses. Some are rumored to haze, others stay far away from anything like that.

For the most part, you don't need to join a house to go to its parties.

People have given good advice in this thread. The things I'll add are: (1) Half of people at Dartmouth don't rush, and there is still plenty of things for them to do. You can still go to parties, as I said, the Hop brings plenty of amazing performers to campus at a student price that makes alum cry when they pay to see the same performers in the real world, there are a thousand clubs, intramural sports, the DOC, etc. (2) One benefit of joining a house is that it's a way of staying connected to campus. When you visit, you'll have a place to go with people you can connect with, even if you graduated years and years ago. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't believe it would be as apocalyptic as you portray. Technology makes filing taxes a heck of a lot easier than it used to be. Businesses, some run by millennials, would develop software that would make compliance workable.

But if your argument is based on compliance costs, that's the argument you should have made. Instead, on the radio and on your website, you relied on a bogus claim that the act would be unconstitutional. I like to think millennials value truth as much as we value cheap shit online, and your argument was just buzzwords thrown together. *edited to fix spelling of one word </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sorry, but the arguments here were absurd. GenOpp keeps using the word unconstitutional, and it does not mean what they think it means. There is nothing unconstitutional about the Internet Sales Tax. A: It's not taxation without representationother than the people in D.C., we have representatives in Congress that are the folks trying to pass the bill! B: There is absolutely nothing in the Constitution prohibiting taxation without representation, otherwise people in the District of Columbia would be exempt from paying federal taxes.

As was pointed out in the clip but seemingly ignored, this isn't a new taxit's an enforcement mechanism. People are supposed to be paying taxes on internet purchases, but nobody does. An internet sales tax does not create a new tax, it just requires people to actually pay what they were supposed to in the first place.

This isn't about fairness. This isn't about technology. As the guest and host admit halfway through, this is about Republicans wanting to do what they always docut or eliminate taxes. Trying to approach it from the angle of protecting the internet marketplace is just transparent pandering towards young people. </TEXT>

Those two relief workers were the very first human beings to ever receive the drug.  It certainly cannot be said that this drug could have been provided to anyone else sooner.

Nor is it appropriate to start sending this out to Africa en masse now. Two people are doing better on this new, untested drug. (Two people is not a test.) We have no idea what factors led to it working and might lead to it killing or causing long term effect. We have no idea if it works differently on the young versus old, white versus black (primaquine is an example of a drug that works differently on certain races), weight, diet, medical histories and conditions, all can cause drugs to impact populations differently.

There may be a point before final FDA of a drug where it is nevertheless appropriate to supply it to those in need. This serum is nowhere near that stage. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The already horrifying case of Cameron Todd Willingham, who many believe was wrongfully executed in Texas in 2004, has gotten worse. 

Previously, the forensic "evidence" against Willingham was shown to be complete and utter bunkthe arson investigators' testimony was riddled with supposedly scientific testimony that turned out to be utterly untrue when tested.

Now, there may be evidence that the jailhouse informer who testified against Willingham received leniency for his testimony, and that Texas prosecutors conspired to conceal this leniency (and in court, denied there were any deals).

I may not be able to say 100% that Willingham was innocent, but I can say that he was railroaded in a rigged trial. His execution was a travesty of justice. </TEXT>

Through movies, novels, etc., ebola has been portrayed as an ultra contagious disease, and West Africa is experiencing one of the worst ebola outbreaks ever. It's ignorant for people to be concerned about being exposed to ebola from this summit (ebola is highly infectious-it takes a tiny amount to infect someone-but it is not highly contagious because it generally does not infect anyone through the air), but I don't think people are saying "eek-black people!", I think they're saying "eek-there's an uncontrolled ebola outbreak in West Africa!" </TEXT>

	<TEXT> An excellent question, and for Colorado, I don't know. As a theoretical matter (removing it from the sphere of jurisdictional-specific case law), I could see a potential case against both. The facility for failing to notify its employees and the police for failing to ensure participants were aware this might occur. (The odds of an unknowing person being affected by this drill seem higheven if the home warned its nurses, what about delivery people? Patients' families? Other visitors? This points to possible recklessness on the part of the police.) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You'd be right in some jurisdictions, but I believe in Colorado, it is enough for the act itself to be intentional with reckless disregard for the emotional health of the affected individual(s).

Depending on what the nursing home and the police agency involved knew and disclosed to the appropriate people, it is possible that either or both could be liable. </TEXT>

(1) The conduct seems sufficient to cause emotional harm in the average person; and (2) If the nurse was not given notice that this sort of drill was occurring or might occur, it would seem to be reckless disregard of the emotional harm such a drill could cause.

 B: Is there any doubt that if there was a naval and air blockade on Gaza, Hamas, Fatah, and other assorted groups would have sent terrorists by sea to blow up civilians. and flown planes into buildings?

C: As far as controlling who and what goes in and out of Gaza by land on the Israeli/Gaza border, that's not a blockade! It's a right of any sovereign nation to determine who and what goes through it. Does controlling the Israel/Gaza border lock in the people of Gaza? Absolutely. But it's not an illegal blockade, it's geography. Even the 1948 borders didn't have Gaza and the West Bank coming close to intersecting (didn't matter then because Gaza was part of Egypt and the West Bank was part of Jordan, but nobody seems to think of that as an occupation). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You're rightIsrael does not have the worst equipment ever. So why is the death toll as small as it is? The Gaza Strip is a tiny slice of land and Israel has powerful weaponry. If Israel treated Gaza the way Russia leveled Grozny in 1999/2000, they wipe Gaza off the map in less than 12 hours.

Destroying everything is easy if you are willing to commit the sort of massacre that people are rightly condemning Moshe Feiglin for suggesting. Either Israel is not deliberately engaging in an extermination campaign against civilians or they have the worst equipment ever, and we agree that they do not have the worst equipment ever.

Avoiding civilian casualties is hard, regardless of the quality of one's military might. Bad intelligence, an 18-y-o kid at the weapons controls with an itchy trigger finger, or just the dense nature of the Gaza Strip, there are lots of factors that can lead to civilian deaths. Every military conflict has had tragic errors similar to the kids on the beach. (The wedding party the US blew up in Yemen in February comes to mind.) </TEXT>

Israel controls the sea and air space because nobody serious disputes that if opened, it would be used for terrorist attacks against Israeli civilians, akin to 9/11 (air attack) or the Hamas frogmen (sea attack) that attempted an attack earlier this week.

	<TEXT> At the risk of sounding disrespectful, it seems as though you're missing the point. There is no need to justify a termination in Virginia. So long as the termination isn't for a prohibited reason, and "retaliation for questioning the 'eyes of the law'" is not a prohibited reason, employees can be fired for any or no reason. Someone can be fired because their new manager doesn't like redheads. Or because he doesn't like names starting with the letter M. Or for no reason at all.

Since my prior post has been down voted a bit, let me note that I'm not defending the decision to fire him, nor am I happy with the at-will doctrine. I find the lack of basic protections for employees abhorrent. But it is what it is (as so many things are). It's not something that's going to be changed based on a court challenge-it would require a legislative change. I'd support such a change. But until then, his performance, whether he's had any disciplinary or corrective action, or how long he's been with the company, all of that doesn't matter. Target could fire him at any time and they chose to do so. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Same story as one posted in /r/music two months ago, just with Neil Young swapped in for the Stones.

To quote what I said in the previous thread, "[Roger] Waters has repeatedly played in China and Russia. He played in Venezuela while Hugo Chavez was in power...I agree that Israel, like any country, does things one might criticize, and that criticizing Israel is not a sign of anti-semitism. If one only criticizes Israel, anti-semitism may become a reasonable inference.

Russia's genocidal policies towards the Chechens eclipsed anything Israel has done towards Palestinians [*coughs* Grozny *coughs*], and yet Roger Waters voiced no criticism of them and indeed, continues to perform in Russia. (Not to mention Russian persecution of homosexuals, current actions towards the Ukraine, the invasion of Georgia, the murder of journalists (such as Anna Politkovskaya, Anastasia Baburova, and Stanislav Markelov), etc.)


China's human rights violations are of such a scale, it is difficult to choose a place to begin. Given that Waters has invoked apartheid in his criticism of Israel, however, perhaps a good starting point is China's discrimination towards it rural workers as part of the hukou system. Many have described the hukou system as apartheid (see http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4424944.stm , for example). China's actions towards Tibet could be said to be analogous to apartheid. And yet Waters voices no criticism of China. And Roger Waters performs in China."

By the 90s, most consumers thought they were imitation Oreos, but in fact, Sunshine Biscuits first sold Hydrox in 1908. After seeing the Hydrox's success, the National Biscuit company (now Nabisco) came out with a knockoff version in 1912: Oreos. 

What made Hydrox superior to Oreos was the cookie element. Hydrox had a harder cookie  not break-a-tooth-tough, but sufficiently stiffer that Oreos seem mushy in comparison. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A case for what, exactly? I'm not sure why /u/MostlyBullshitStory has been downvotedthey are right. It sucks, sure, but Virginia is an at-will state, so employees can be fired at any time for any reason, or even for no reason. The exceptions are that federal law protects people from being fired due to age, race, religion, gender, national origin, or disability, and a Virginia statute protects people form being fired for filing a safety or health complaint. (Shoplifting is not considered a safety or health complaint.)

It does not matter if the employee has being doing something for 8 years without issue-the employee can be fired at any time so long as it doesn't fall into one of the exceptions above.
