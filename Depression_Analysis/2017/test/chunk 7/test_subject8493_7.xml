	<TEXT> *some* of them care about those things , plenty of others just want to provide helpful answers. I've answered lots of stack exchange questions and don't care about all that "is it relevant enough, did enough people reply/view this, is it interesting enough, is it truly a question blah blah -- all those are subjective; to the person asking the question and others searching for the same question later, it *is* relevant/important. The site didn't used to be so "snobby" and "elitist" and was therefore more helpful to the average person. I stopped contributing for that reason. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Good. Alternatives to Reddit will only help Reddit get better and/or provide users with more options. I generally like Voat so far, though the communities are still quite small for many subverses.  </TEXT>
