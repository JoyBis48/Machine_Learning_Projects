It's not a post made to ahdere to the strict definition of the word expendable.

	<TEXT> I agree. With Tanya she has a fatality where she stomps through their midsection and creates a hole just like the one Scorpion's fireball fatality does. Then she stomps through their face and leaves a hole identical to the one Jacqui leaves when she punches through. When Jacqui does that you can see some embers on the inside of the enemy's head, presumably because she used some kind of shot to boost the attack (gunpowder scorches?).

But when Tanya stomps through their face you can also see embers/orange glowing. Just makes it feel a little lazy when you see so many repeated gore effects. </TEXT>

I bought the first game (just before the third one was released) and it was better than I thought. I initially thought it looked kind of shitty to be honest, like a poor man's Tomb Raider.

	<TEXT> Tipping isn't weird, expecting a tip is weird. We understand that American employers like to (and are allowed to) pay their staff fuck-all under the premise that the tips will make their wage fair.

Over here our waiters/waitresses are paid properly so tips are literally nothing more than a bonus. For this reason most people (myself included) only tip when they feel they received service that went above and beyond merely taking my order and bringing me my food. if the waiter/waitress goes out of their way to make my dining experience as enjoyable as reasonably possible I'll leave a tip. Fuck up my order? Any chance of a tip goes out the window.

I should clarify, if I'm in America I'll tip because I understand that it's expected over there. On the flip side, Americans are always welcomed by waiting staff over here because their tipping habits make them seem extremely generous :) </TEXT>

To be fair, I kind of support this stereotype. Due to years of eating too much junk food, drinking too many fizzy drinks, and smoking, my teeth aren't yellow, but they're far form bright white.

Also when I was much younger I nearly got braces but complained my way out of it. I wish I'd had braces, my teeth aren't all sorts of fucked up, but they could be more aligned. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This was on the front page all day yesterday.

I checked out my paypal account (I hardly use it but it's good for the occasional online purchase). Luckily I never gave them my mobile number, for reasons just like this. This is why google and youtube will also never receive my phone number.

Edit: closed off that pesky parenthesis.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So... there's a vault dweller... and he has a dog.

Could this be a true sequel? Playing as your character from last gen with dog meat in tow? Probably not, but the end of the trailer was too similar to the end of Fallout 3 to be coincidence right?

RIGHT? </TEXT>

Is it horse armour or The Ballad of Gay Tony? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Fallout was never Skyrim with guns, it was Oblivion with guns. At this stage I wouldn't even want Skyrim with guns. Skyrim is my favourite game but man does it fucking look old now.

On newer, more powerful consoles we should get a game built from the ground up, not just some high res PS3 game. </TEXT>
