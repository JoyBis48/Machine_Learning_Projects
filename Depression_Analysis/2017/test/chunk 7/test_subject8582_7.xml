	<TEXT> The question was about Second Impact, which was merely the result of a contact experiment between a human and Adam. Every single Impact was a result of the combination of Lilith and Adam. First Impact was when Lilith landed on Earth, terraforming it for Lilin and requiring Adam to be impaled on his Lance. 2I was the contact experiment- no Lilith soul involved. 3I was souls and bodies, in as well as the combination of Unit-01 and Zeruel's S2 engine, AND the combination of Ascended Unit-01 and the Adam-based MP-Evas. That's why 3I was able to start instrumentality.  </TEXT>

During Second Impact, the combination was the body of Adam with the flesh of the Lilith-based humans. Lilith herself still had her soul, back under the city eventually known as Tokyo-3.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Despite forcing the children to sign a contract, keep in mind that the contract was signed by minors, and therefore null and void. His factory is also several square miles, violating his property and moving into the private property of the surrounding city. He can't have let any health inspectors into his factory, and I refuse to believe his been paying taxes. He's housing potentially thousands of illegal immigrants. The glass elevator is *incredibly* dangerous, which could be considered a weapon.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Simon the Digger vs Shinji Ikari, I guess. I want to say Unit-01 could actually win, simply because I like NGE more than Gurren Lagann, but if Simon had transformations beyond Arc-Gurren Lagann then Eva gets rekt. If not, then it ends up being a classic battle of unmovable object vs unstoppable force. Bizzaro-Lagann could take it, since as he gets more and more scared of losing, he's going to get stronger and stronger, which will eventually result in him being stronger than Simon with all the Spiral Power in the universe. The question is if Simon kills Shinjimon before he can accumulate the power required to kill GL with pure bitchliness. I give it to simon 6/10, but if it were anyone other than Simon i would actually give it to Bizarro GL.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Most of my favorite fictional women I actually like for their character, not out of lust. I could stand Mothra trying to seduce me or 24 hours (though that would be funny as hell). Bayonetta would be harder, but since she's built like Slenderman with some well-placed fruit in his outfit, I think I could last if a million dollars were on the line. One day simply isn't enough to be worth a million. Now if I got to spend the rest of my life with her in exchange for a million dollars, that would be different.  </TEXT>

EDIT: There are a few cons, come to think of it. Volumes 13 and 14 are still only available in the seperate volumes, giving you four monoliths of Eva mangas and two tiny little books at the end. hopefully they'll do an Omnibus release to have those two included as well, preferably alongside Volume 12 so it can be a full End of Evangelion package.  </TEXT>

I would never have to spend money on gas, my lawn would mow itself, my oven would never burn anything, my devices would always hold a charge, it's the most useful Pokemon in day-to-day life.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My favorite Pokemon is Braviary. 

Braviary isn't the most *supernaturally* powerful of all the Pokemon, but its strength will fit right in in the Capital Wasteland. Not to mention the fact that its pure patriotism is rivaled only by... Liberty Prime, actually. The Enclave wouldn't beef with someone patriotic enough to pal around with a red, white, and blue eagle, especially when that eagle can wreck an entire platoon of power armored soldiers with one Return. If we take the place of any random NPC, we'll be fine. We probably have enough strength to take a settlement like the supermarket, then defend it while still being on the good side of one of the major factions. If we take the place of the Lone Wanderer, then things get a little tougher since I can't have Dogmeat. Plus, being hunted down by anyone might end up with them sniping my bird. 

NPC: We live long, healthy lives

PC: We don't make it to the end.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Contrary to popular belief, Gojira may well be the worst film to start out on. It's gritty, it's dark, and it's almost completely different from every other film in the franchise. The best one to start out on is probably new, American Godzilla. It doesn't have the problem of the special effects that most people find hard to overlook until they're already fans of the series. After that, I would say Godzilla vs Mothra (1964) as that is probably the best monster mash in the franchise.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I know it's cliche, but Sword Art Online. It had *so much* potential in its initial premise, but the characters are so boring and the plot so poorly written that I couldn't even make it to the end of the first half that everyone says is good.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The "gay/teams panic" defense. It's the defense that you killed a gay/teams person because you saw them and just went berserk due to a mental disorder. It's only been outlawed in California because no one else is enough of a dumbass to think it would work. Because it never has worked, because you'd have to be a complete dumbass to think it would.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Season one is *sort of* in two parts. You could say that post-Episode 8 Kill la Kill is pretty different from the first 7, since they form a more linked and emotional plot. You could also say that when the second OP shows up (after the "recap episode") is sort of a second part.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Gurren Lagann. I need more of that shit, there's more that can probably be done with it. Maybe the chronicles of Lordgenome in the original battle against the Antispiral? I don't know, but whatever it could be would probably ruin the ending of the original.  </TEXT>
