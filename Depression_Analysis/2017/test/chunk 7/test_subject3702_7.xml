	<TITLE> windows 8 network connection issues </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-06-03 00:24:47 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi all,

just bought a new ASUS laptop running 64-bit Windows 8.

The problem is, I cannot connect to anything via ssh ftp sftp etc...

I've tried connecting to a few different servers using putty, winscp and fireftp all with the same result: "Network Error: Connection Timed Out"

I can't even connect to one of the websites I manage via the cpanel ui for the same reasons. 

I've ruled out router or ISP problems, as I can do all of these things on both my phone and old computer on the same ntwork.

I have also tried disabling Windows Firewall completely, but still get the same network error.

Very frustrated, any help would greatly be appreciated!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You know what? I call bullshit. Or at least gross over exaggeration. Or I am misunderstanding the full time college part.

168 hours in a week. You average 75 hours of work and 40 hours of school.

We're left with 53 hours for the week. 

You need 35 of those to sleep (5 hours/night). I suppose that you could crunch this down by going with some alternative sleep cycle, but I'm going to assume that if you work around 75 hours a week, you're schedule doesn't allow for it.

So now we have 18 hours left for the week. I figure, hey, you live decently close to school and work. Assuming that you have a day where you do not physically have to be at either of these places, you do not remain sedentary, we'll average a 15 minute one-way transit time. And that you are in transit for approximately 1 hour every day (to and from, to and from).

What remains is around 1 and a half hours of unscheduled time left in your day. Let's say the math is fuzzy and that you have 3 hours of unscheduled time. You need to do laundry, pay bills, eat, clean your house, buy groceries, get dressed, bathe etc. 

If that were you, you wouldn't be on reddit right now. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Is it worth a life? What about if it was your stuff? Your computer? Your car? Would you kill someone who was taking your entire life savings if you knew it was the only way of recovering it?

A computer is not equal to a car, but are very much similar compared to your entire life savings. 

None of which the young man was likely to be running away with.

But either way, the reason why none of this should be happening in the first place is that we operate under a justice system.

What's actually absurd is the fact that people go through such lengths to defend murder by means of vigilante justice. Because, no matter what position you take in terms of whether or not the store owner had the proper motivations, the store owner committed a murder. 

Even more, the store owner murdered a young man for what was presumably petty theft. So not only did the he murder someone, but his arbitrary punishment far outweighed the crime.

And further still, I seriously do not understand why people really want to reserve the right to shoot at fleeing burglars. One would think that it was a) bad to kill another human without the absolute necessity, and b) that absolute necessity requires extreme duress or life threatening danger.

So, no. It is in my mind never ok to blow someone's head off with a shotgun because they were taking property from you.  </TEXT>

Are you ready to be a chef?

Absolutely fucking not.... but

Are you ready to be a line cook?

Fuck yeah dude! You will find your place depending on your current skill, general kitchen intelligence and aptitude for getting crushed on the line. If you are not confident in these last two qualities, you'll most likely find your self on the fry station. 

But don't fret! Thats good. If you work hard and are diligent about cleaning, putting out good plates and have a good attitude, you will find yourself getting more shifts and the opportunity to move to other stations. You'll also get an excellent idea of how that kitchen works, who the main guys are and any of the sous and actual chefs quirks.

Work there for *at least* a year, preferably two if you think its a good fit. If you absolutely hate working the oine after a year/year and a half. Theres your answer, no, chef career crossed off. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When I first saw the ring, I was terrified for MONTHS!

Then I watched it a few years ago with some friends thinking it would be a good scary movie. We ended up laughing through the whole thing. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have experienced sleep paralysis for most of my life. When I first started to experience it, there were no visuals, just the inability to move. 

Now every once and a while when I get it, I open my eyes and see what looks like spiders crawling out of corners in the walls. It is slightly alarming, but I quickly realize what is happening. I've found that it's actually a great way to drift off and get into a lucid dream... I just kind of "succumb" to the paralysis, and just be aware that I'm dreaming. 

I've also had the feeling of shaking on the bed, like what's characterized in those "possession" type of horror movies. Which, needless to say, was *very* alarming the first time. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Awesome, thanks. It turns out I have a good buddy that lives there now, he was a little more optimistic than you... but I'm going to chance it! </TEXT>

	<TITLE> San Diego in February? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> I'm looking at taking a short trip to San Diego towards the end of Feb. I live in PDX, and just want to break up the winter. Really the number one thing I want to do is sit on a beach (don't really have to swim, but that would be excellent).

What are your guys opinions? I'm an east coast transplant and am silly and ignorant about the pacific ocean in general... Is it going to be too chilly to sit around on a beach towards the end of February? 

Thanks in advance for any input! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> To be honest, in the first shop I ever developed, there is a comment at the very top of some javascript code that says:

/*
*I'm really sorry, this is a horrible mess.

*I know if you're reading this, you'll hate me, but I had to get it done.

*this comment is written in retrospect,  and can offer you no help, but know that my future self apologizes that this code happens to work.
