	<TEXT> Reddit is the only place I know where Armageddon is put down so heavily. It's far from one of the greats, but if you saw it growing up, you didn't give a shit about realism or cheesiness. It was pure awesomeness. I have a feeling its the hivemind or anit-michael bay bandwagon at work, because no one outside this site slams that movie like Reddit does.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When Lost in Space came out, I was probably 10 or 12. My dad used to drop my brother and I off at the movies while he was working (this was during summer) and we watched Lost and Space over and over and over again and loved it. Great movie for a kid. Watched it recently and still loved it BUT finally realized why so many didn't.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> During the interrogation scene, the Joke tells Batman "Don't talk like one of them. You're not. Even if you'd like to be." Now obviously he's referring to the police or anyone in empowered to keep Gotham safe, but by saying that, was he just trying to get under Batman's skin, or was he saying that he thinks that's Batman's motivation? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Racism or the lack aside, that movie was so unbelievably unwatchable. It was the same joke the entire movie. Will Ferrell acts un-hard and Kevin Hart delivers his "What are you doing?!?!?" line. That's Get Hard in a nut shell.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This was pretty close to my favorite movies list when I was 16 too. Honestly your favorite movies are your own preference, and its really hard not to adore the classic, but the more films you see, the more your taste will change slightly and you'll find yourself being interested in films you never thought you would. Solid list though. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Truthfully, I'm not a huge fan of them myself, but I understand the appeal and I think too many people want to "stand out" from the "sheeple" and claim they suck for no other reason than just to be a douche. Like what you want to like. There's a reason they make so many superhero movies and that's because so many people like them. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree to an extent. I decided a long time ago I'll never do a midnight showing of any movie. I also hate 3D movies- but only because it hurts my eyes. But prices alone are ridiculous. Movies can def be enjoyed at home usually with as much fun.  </TEXT>
