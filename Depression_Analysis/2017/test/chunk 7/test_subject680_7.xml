I used to use mybogey.com.  Web site that does use slope, but since they are not affiliated with the pga, they can't say they give you an official handicap.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So, if someone breaks into my house, I have to politely ask them to leave first?  No.  I shoot them and it's 100% legal. Same goes for store owners.  That man was committing a felony and the store owner stopped him.  It's wasn't "something he didn't like", it was a fucking crime.   You can't try to sell drugs, get robbed, then call the police to try to get your drugs or money back, just like you can't try to steal and get your ass kicked, then try to call the police.  Criminals have no recourse.  That is the whole reason the Mafia first came about.  </TEXT>
