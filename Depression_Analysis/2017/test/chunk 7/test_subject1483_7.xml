The farm they were on was ***3.2million acres***. My "country" is 2.5 square miles (circa 1600 acres). You can fit my entire country 2000 times into that one single farm.

Backwards compatibility will hopefully allow you to play any 360 game you own, natively on your Xbox one (provided that developers give Xbox their permission to use old games for free on the new system). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree the UI needs changing but that isn't the way to go about it. On console it would take you forever to get to your current gear as each tab take a second or 2 to load.


The best method would be drop down lists like they have on the bestiary, alchemy tabs etc. This way you can select the category you need without having to load everything else up on the way. It will give much easier access to your current equipment as you would only need to flick right once and you can add many categories without it looking like a cluster fuck. 


They were so close, yet so far. They had the idea just didn't implement it where needed.


Any ways that's my 2 cents. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I just don't understand this credit thing tbh. Where I live you use what you have in the present, not use what you will have in the future. Credit cards are just weird to me and I don't understand why someone will willingly get a credit card knowing you will end up paying more for your purchases. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not the same thing really. That was giving you extra in-game money, this is giving you exclusive weapons that deal more damage. You could make 1,000,000 in GTA in a couple of hours, you will never use these weapons unless you get the pre-order bonus. It will kill the pvp especially since it's at launch, a few players will have better gear form the start because of this bullshit.

	<TEXT> This is just getting out of hand, and making jokes about it isn't going to help the situation. I'm not from America but it pains me to see that the "leading" country on this planet can't even get it's own police force under control. You're out waging war with half the world when you have fundamental problems in your own country that just get passed by and swept under the rug. Go to the streets get your voices heard, enough is enough. </TEXT>
