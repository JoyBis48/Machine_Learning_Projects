	<TEXT> But it doesn't have to be. I respect if you feel like you're fine with the way things are, I just think there's a way to bring your 5 in tune with everyone else's. But that's all I'll say about it. Just know, if you ever need to talk to someone, I'm available.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ok, I've dealt with a lot of these comments and remained civil about it, but seriously Fuck You. You think I haven't tried other means? I've exercised, done various forms of meditation, tried to force myself out of it. You've faced loss? So have I. You think I can't think of anything good? Mother fucker I've had plays performed across the country, I have more creativity in my left ring finger than you have in your whole body. If you were able to work through your shit together good for you, but how dare you come down on someone who needs more help than that. Shame on you.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Dude, we had this conversation almost 24 hours ago, check the post. My diagnosis is  Dysthymia with a secondary presentation of a Major Depressive Disorder. This developed from my original diagnosis of Atypically presenting Depression. I consider it one diagnosis, people argued with me, I am agreeing to disagree on this. So no I've lived with this for around 15 years so I understand it quite well thanks. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's their opinion. It's pointless to argue with people who won't update their understanding to the modern world. I look at people who take that view on mental illness as the Westboro Church of the medical community. They're just silly and can't be argued with so it's best to ignore them.  </TEXT>

 That's what I was initially diagnosed with a year ago. At the time it was atypical because I could sleep and find some joy in day to day life. Less so now. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's a very tauist way of looking at things, I can definitely see how that could help some people. I personally feel that if the problem is chemical than focus alone won't help, but again, the brain is crazy strange and powerful so I can see how it may work for some people. That's one of the reasons I'm exploring meditation. </TEXT>
