	<TEXT> What's your source on the north having more slaves? The other guy already spoke about NJ, so what are the other states that didn't give up their slaves? If you say MD or KY, remember that they were already under marshal law. 

we were fighting to keep North troops out of our homes because they were actively making grabs for our land.

What land were northern troops grabbing before secession?

There was also the issues of state rights

What about State's rights? 

massive taxes that were slowly driving us into crippling poverty

What taxes are these? Are you referring to the shipping tariffs? 

Yes,  Sherman's March was devastating. But do you have a source for the rapes, murders, and burning people alive? 

There were no saints on either side, but that doesn't mean the south was fighting for the right thing?  </TEXT>

I don't think I did, considering your next sentences. 

The Messiah is (sic) perfect

No, he will not be.

Humans are not perfect. 

Very true. And the Messiah will be human.

 The Messiah would have been able to follow the OT laws perfectly.

Nope, as I said, the Messiah will be human, no need to be perfect. 

Of course Jews still follow those laws, but the entire point of the OT was what?

To teach us, of course. After all it is called the Teaching.

They also don't believe in Jesus. That is a concept which is part of the entire point of Christianity.

No, Judaism, is not Christianity - Jesus. The theology, even just about the Messiah, is very, very different.

	<TEXT> This is because Judaism/Jews predate the modern separation between religion and ethnicity. The best way to think about Judaism is that it is a set of laws for a tribe, the Jewish people. The tribe got dispersed and carried their rules with them. You are part of the tribe if you were born into it by its rules, or you gain nationality by becoming a citizen - in modern times, convert.  Does that make sense? 

Now for your other points:    

They still are Jewish. Someone can be Jewish, no practicing, or even having rejected the religion and their family lineage is not traced back to eastern Europe, or it's a weak connection which normally wouldn't be used to identify race. It doesn't make sense. 

First, Jews trace lineage back to the expulsion from Israel, not to eastern Europe. Only a subset of Jews, Ashkenazim, are from Eastern Europe.

Second, the connection isn't so much used to identify race as your national/tribal affiliation. Think of it like this: Once you gain American citizenship, all your children are American citizens no matter where they are born. All their children, your grandchildren, are American even if they never enter America. Now just have the extra step that it must be your mother, not any American, and you've got a rough equivalency.

I just don't get how if I marry a jewish girl who's father is a north African Jew, mother is christian Caucasian. We get married and ignore all religion. Our kids would be Jewish?

See the nationality explanation above. The only difference is that for your kids to be American you have to register their birth an the embassy, but for Judaism is automatic. (Minor point: She would not be Jewish by traditional Jewish laws, so many Jews would not think she was Jewish and therefore her children would not be either.)

What is your thoughts on people saying something negative towards Israel as, 'Those Israeli...?'

It's as good (bad) as any other prejudice is. The problem is that many people say this to cover up anti-Semitism, and you only have to prod an inch for it to come out. It makes Jews assume that its not said with good intentions. </TEXT>

3. A bunch of links; only one mentions this topic. It is an Haaretz editorial, which only says this behavior is "historic." Again no examples.

	<TEXT> Certainly it has significance. The polytheist/Atheist would make a similar cry against claims of monotheism as a way to box you in from using your own text and history to explain/define what you beleive about God. 

What?

No. You don't have to accept what is written with respect to Christianity as true but to reject it out of hand as part of the argument itself is disingenuous. Like the Moslem, you a Jew can claim it has been corrupted or misinterpreted/manipulated. 

I am not claiming this. You are claiming as proof that Jesus forgiving sins means he is God. I am saying that the only thing we know is that Jesus **says** he forgive sins. Unlike everything else in the NT, this is something he said, not something he did. Therefore, this is not a proof.

Because the Op self identifies as a Moslem and that was how my response begin. Jews clearly make different arguments. 

Looks like we pretty much make the same argument here...

	<TEXT> It has no significance because it is the central claim that is being disputed. 

Others : Jesus is not God!

You: But what about healing others, mastering nature, forgiving sins and raising from the dead? [This shows he is God!]

Others: Many other prophets healed others, mastered nature, said God forgave sins and raised from the dead. These do not make Jesus unique. 

You: But Jesus forgave sins of people directly, showing he is God!

Others: That is the claim that the NT is making, and is tautological. For Jesus to forgive sins, he must be God. The only proof we have of this, even through the NT itself, is Jesus saying so. Claiming to forgive sins does not make Jesus unique.

Make sense?

He also is reported to have said others after will do these and much greater things (JN 14:12) so not being unique isn't the significant qualifier.

Ok, then why did you say that these acts are ignored? And even so, we're talking about people **before,** not after.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> There have been a couple of threads up on how we do act. We all know that neither the RedPill approach or the Nice Guy approach is the right one, but we don't know *how* to show interest without being seen as creepy or aggressive. So here's the thread where you give us all advice! What is the difference between aggressive and confident? How do you hit on people without being a PUA? What are the signals that tell you that the girl wants you to go further or to stop?

We know a lot about what not to do, but what **can** we do?

Here are some specific questions, and I'm sure that some other shy guys have more!

Situation: Bar or club

1. I see someone attractive that I want to hit on. What are ways to show interest? What is a good way to start a conversation? I've seen ways that seem rude (getting in their body space, bumping into them on purpose and then introducing yourself, etc.), but is there a positive way of getting and maintaining attention?
  
2. While dancing, how to start dancing with someone without breaking boundaries they might have? I have heard girls complain more than once about guys getting to touchy, and I've seen girls willingly start to grind immediately. How to tell the difference?

Situation: A friend 

1. I have a friend or a close friend that I am developing feelings for or am already interested in. I have no idea whether they like me back. How do I convey this without being too creepy or violating boundaries? What level of touching is ok before having an explicit conversation? 

2. I have a friend or a close friend that I am developing feelings for or am already interested in, and I think they are returning my feelings. What are the appropriate steps to take? What is a good way to bring it up, and what is a good way to back out if I'm wrong?

Situation: An acquaintance or passerby

1. I see someone on public transport, on the street, a diner, etc. Is there any way to approach without being a creep? There's more than one article or thread we've read that women don't like being seen as sex objects everywhere they go, so this is a fine line to walk.

2. I have a distant crush on someone I see fairly regularly, like class or work. We might say hi once in a while. What is a good way to approach for the first time? Is it better to try being a friends first, or to ask immediately for a date? 

I'll add anymore if people give me some!

One last thing: We don't want to be Nice Guys, but we're shy because we don't want to be like the assholes we see and that our female friends complain about. We are invested in our identity of being the nice, responsible person, and we don't necessarily want to change that outside of being less shy. As the threads on /r/AskMen have shown, the messages being sent by both society and people around us are confusing, to say the least. We want to be a nice person as well as get hookups/dates/relationships, depending on the individual, but not be creeps. 

Please share your general advice as well as for the situations I described above!

	<TEXT> Oh lordy, here we go again.

The prophecies:

Correct: 3 (but see disputations about genealogy) 

Any Jew, only prophetic in a general sense: 2

About the Messiah but Misinterpreted: 4

Not a prophecy: 5

Not about the Messiah: 1, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 21, 26, 27, 28, 29

Psalms: 6, 9, 13, 18, 19, 20, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26 

Psalms is not prophetic, it is very nice poetry. You can try and prove otherwise, if you want to try...

Malachi 3:1 - Probably not about the Messiah, and even if it is, their interpretation is nonsensical.

Daniel 9 - This is not about the Messiah. [See here.](http://jewsforjudaism.org/knowledge/articles/counter-missionary-2/texts/daniel-9-a-true-biblical-interpretation/)

10 points - These are all pretty stupid post hoc connections. They are not "foreshadowing" of any kind.

Please, even for Christians there are better arguments than these... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> why does Israel has the right to break the air space of another country, to draw bombs on it infrastructures and move out

**Because they are at war, and the IDF is attacking military targets.** How long will it take to get this through your head? This is what happens in war. If they don't want this to happen, they should finally make peace.

When Hamas send it rockets from Gaza with almost zero casualties, Israel destroyed whole gaza and killed thousands, Oh yeah I forgot that was totaly self defense....

Because civilians were under attack, and one of the primary purpose of a state is to defend it's residents. Again Syria is totally allowed to attack Israel military bases (not civilians like they did in previous wars), but they know they will be utterly crushed. </TEXT>
