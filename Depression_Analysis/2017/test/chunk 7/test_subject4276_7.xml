Once you spend like an hour arm wrestling with him until he falls asleep he'll sleep through the night but if something wakes him up in the middle of the night good luck and be prepared to not get anymore sleep until tomorrow  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Baby proofing for the technologically inclined family? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-03-06 03:22:30 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Back when my siblings and I were younglings it seemed like baby proofing the house was much simpler: gates for stairs, keeping doors closed/locked, putting covers on the electrical sockets. Most households still only had one TV, and maybe one game system. Phone Jacks were easily hidden behind furniture or were high up on a wall to begin with. And we didn't even get our first family computer until I was about 5.

Fast forward to today, my living room has a TV,  an AV receiver, a computer for the TV, a wireless router, a modem, speakers and a subwoofer, an external hard drive that needs to be plugged in, and four game consoles. It's all in one area and I need two power strips to handle it all. Then upstairs, I have a computer desk with open sides and back so all the cables are exposed.

Basically I really need some protips to baby proof all these wires and cables before little Ricky Bobby starts crawling and wants to play with the wires </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Screen size, resolution, refresh rate, type of back light, and brand, all things that are great to know... But how do I find out what I really want to know when looking for a TV? </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Yes, some brands may be more reliable than others, some may have a brighter screen, and some may have better remotes (for those of you not using a universal one). But it feels like most of what will make you happy with your purchase are things you can't filter or sort by on Amazon or Newegg. If it's a smart TV, what does the interface look like? Is it snappy and quick? Or is it sluggish and burdensome? How customizable are the TV settings? How well does the CEC (anynet+, bravia sync etc) perform? Is that reasonably customizable or does it operate by the laws of entropy? How does the screen look if you're in a bright room? Are reflections a problem? 

My point is, I'm looking for a TV and sure I can find all the "technical specs" but I can't find human interface or experience specifications which is making it extremely difficult to choose a TV I want </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Did Simmons talk about being into music at all in the QA? His role seems like it would be extremely difficult for someone without any sort of background in music performance. If he didn't have any experience with music that makes his acting performance so much better. Having done Orchestra and jazz myself had I never seen any of Simmons' previous roles, he would have had me convinced he was a director/musician first and actor second. His gestures, mannerisms, and movements were spot on perfect, including the throwing the chair bit. That seems to be a common trait for band directors.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> And the FDA tried to put a stop to it, but backed off thanks to public comments


The revisions also address the issue of the use of spent grains, which are by-products of alcoholic beverage brewing and distilling that are commonly used as animal food. Concerns were raised that the proposed rules would require brewers and distillers to comply with the full human food and animal food rules if they made their wet spent grains available for animal feed. Theupdated proposed rule would clarify that human food processors that create by-products used as animal food and are already complying with FDA human food safety requirements  such as producers of wet spent grains  would not need to comply with the full animal food rule if they are already complying with the human-food rule.

	<TEXT> I always make this recommendation because when I moved into Bozeman for school, a couple places I applied at told me they already had hired people that were starting in a couple weeks when they got in from out of state. That upset me a bit because I was there and ready to work immediately. 

I've also put in applications to places and not get a response, even while trying to follow up on them and have them end up calling me over a month later for an interview. 

It's tough to say what would be the best course of action if they're telling you to apply when you're actually up here. Like what /u/Croup-vandemar said, maybe don't mention you haven't yet permanently moved, but I wonder if it's worth it to book a flight to make an interview when you're not guaranteed a job. I feel like some places may be open to a phone interview, but like before, you run the risk of them passing and telling you to try later </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah but the problem is that the population is growing faster than  the rate of housing being built. And as I said, housing is only half of the problem. The other part is the quantity of available jobs and whether they can or are willing to pay a living wage, or continue to rely on cheap college labor  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The college is causing a depreciation of both jobs and housing. Every year, they let more freshman attend, even though they don't have the facilities to house them and for the first month they'll stuff 4 students into what are supposed to be common rooms for the dorms. Then the next year those freshman go out and try to get am apartment off campus, filling up all the available apartments. Sure, there's always something for rent, but competition is nuts. 

When my brother was moving up to Bozeman for school, my parents wanted to save some money by having him basically rent a room from my wife and I. I was for it because we would be able to rent a place with more space for less money, but we never found anything and he ended up going to the dorms. That brings me to my next point: you might have to be willing to rent sight unseen. We found something that would work great and was the right cost, so we set up the soonest available appointment to look at it. The place went on the market the very day we called. The first appointment to look at it was in a week. We show up to look at it and nobody is there. We wait about 10 minutes and nothing. We called the rental agency and they told us they ready found tenants for that property, without even notifying the people who scheduled appointments to look at it. 

Now for jobs, demand for jobs is very high, again because there are so many students. You might get lucky because some positions might open up with students leaving for the summer, but don't expect to get paid a whole lot. Many companies are taking advantage of the cheap unskilled college labor. Why pay someone more because they know what they're doing? We can hire this other guy, and train him for less money because he's willing to work for cheap because he needs rent/beer money. Unless you are a professional, it's a little difficult to make a decent living out here. 

Anyway, that's my ranting and raving about Bozeman. I love the place but I moved to Billings for work because I wasn't making any progress in paying off my student loans there </TEXT>

	<TEXT> And not only that, it spurred a fad where it seemed like every publisher started pushing games with proprietary controllers that would never be used again so they could cash in on selling meh games for $100+ like that Tony hawk game with the skateboard controller. People just got burned out about buying games you couldn't just use a regular controller with. 

Though now it seems they've moved onto things like Skylander where they can get kids to beg their parents to buy them these action figures that also double as characters in a game </TEXT>

Well now we have room and want to have it again and it's nearly impossible to find good equipment. Ended up spending a hundred bucks getting two guitars, and drums, all with the wireless receivers, and the guy also had DJ Hero with it. The guitars are in okay condition, but we can only use one because one of the wireless receivers is actually a rockband 2 receiver, and I don't even know about the drums yet because the usb connection to the circuit board on the receiver is shot so I have to replace that usb cable.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I feel ya there. The last restaurant I worked at I did a year and 3 months there. If you worked an average of 30+ hours per week between open enrollment periods you'd qualify for health benefits. Well I did get 30+ hours per week but the restaurant opened in January, and open enrollment ended mid December. Basically, no matter how many hours you worked, every person who got hired for opening the restaurant got screwed out of health benefits for another year. I had already been looking for a better paying job when I found that out but that only intensified my search. 

Now instead of barely scraping by each month paying only the minimal amount on my semi-crippling debt of $18,000 thanks to school, I've paid off $7,000 since April  </TEXT>

Though they keep petitioning Montanan government to waive some certain taxes that are levied here claiming they are a burden and Montana keeps rejecting it. I have a bad feeling that if they don't get their way they will sell the market to comcast. I haven't had any complaints with them so far since they took over from optimum/Cablevision. They recently doubled everyone in the cities from 30/2 to 60/4. It's by no means Google fiber but hey, it's Montana, at least I'm not mailing my reddit comments via pony express.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> How does this compare to using motioninjoy for the ds3? I hated the finicky software. Half the time it seemed like my controller wouldn't connect and it felt like there was noticeable input lag. In addition to that, needing to translate the onscreen buttons to be relevant for a playstation controller since games always showed the xbox buttons. 

I really like the dualshock 4 but I REALLY like being able to use the 360 wireless controller adapter and just turning the controller on and being able to use it immediately, wirelessly, and without any setup. Just the other day I discovered I could use the controller for XBMC, I hadn't even thought to try it </TEXT>
