	<TEXT> My school had a bomb threat, one of the students phoned up and said they have placed a bomb somewhere in the school, everyone was evacuated onto the yard (Which was about 50 feet from the buildings, what good that would do) the police were then called and they had the canine unit searching the school for the bomb, they found nothing everything was fine i think they found the student and removed him from the school this was in the UK, all in all i didn't mind, i missed all my classes that day, thank you bomb kid... you're the bomb.

Found a link here if anyone is interested, i don't go to the school anymore. http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/teenager-charged-over-broadgreen-international-3352147 </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I feel like this system could be easily abused, what if there was multiple scouts on one map by multiple i mean like 30, what if some player just likes making random markers at places for no actual reason, it is a tough issue to solve.

I was thinking something like the commander tag, but for scouts, the tag allows their text in map chat to show up in a different colour to the others, a scout tag, it would also allow people to see which towers have scouts, due to it showing up on the map much like the commander tag, not sure of the pricing of this tag tho, maybe 100g like the old commander tag? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I feel the elementals would be alot better if they were made permanently summoned until death then they go on cd, much like necros felsh golem, it would be sooooo much better, this along with the lesser elementals too. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You're right it doesn't feel like you're a plague cloud, probably the best way to do this would be to make the cloud much larger, the actual size of the aoe area, although this would make you a much larger target, it would still be very cool and feel alot more like an elite through a simple cosmetic change. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Don't have to worry about dungeons all classes are viable, while some may be better than others when it comes to damage or utility, you can be useful as any class if played right, so play what you enjoy, I had the same problem as you, I forced myself to level to 80 even though I was bored, can't say it wasn't worth it once I hit 80. </TEXT>
