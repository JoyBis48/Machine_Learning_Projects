	<TEXT> Kevin, here is a comment you made about the Ferguson protestors (I'll hyperlink it so you can click it and be taken to the source):

[Ferguson riots have very little to do with the shooting of the young man. It is an excuse to be the losers these animals truly are. **It is a tipping point to frustration built up over years of not trying, but blaming everyone else, The Man, for their failures.** It's always someone else's fault when you give up. Hopefully this is a reminder to the African Americans \( I always thought we just Americans. Oh, well.\) that their President [they] voted in has only made things worse for them, not better.](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/21/kevin-sorbo-ferguson-animals-losers_n_5697647.html)

My questions is as follows:  

In regards to the selection I have bolded: Do you really believe that African Americans are not at a disadvantage in our (American) society? Enslaved for hundreds of years, [falsely reported as inferior by pseudo-scientific studies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_racism#United_States:_slavery_justified), segregated after emancipation, subjected to [institutional racism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institutional_racism#United_States) (especially in Ferguson, MO as cited by a [DOJ report](http://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/opa/press-releases/attachments/2015/03/04/ferguson_police_department_report.pdf)), constantly bashed by conservative media, etc. After all of the history and examples I have linked, do you still believe they are simply "not trying"?

	<TEXT> The first panic attack I ever had was when I lit up my first joint. My heart started racing and I felt like I was losing control.   

I kept jumping up and down saying "you see, it's not a dream because you're not flying."

I continued to touch everything I could because I was convinced that I was dreaming. I went to bed that night and I wasn't the same for months. I was in constant dismay about reality. I would have panic attacks. 'Inception' struck a chord and I haven't watched the movie since.   

Then I was with a close friend and I started projecting my issues to him. He said: 

"You know, test_subject4255, even if we are living in a dream, isn't it the best dream ever?"

I haven't forgot that since. 

I was convinced that I just had a laced joint so I had to prove to myself that it was a fluke. I've smoked twice since (over a 6 year period) and I have had some good experiences. Things that really turned my mind around. I don't plan on using it again because it's really not my taste but I'm glad I got over my fear. I haven't had a panic attack since.  

Anyway, I know that you're probably trying to find a connection between your current state and my story and I just wanted to let you know that it is MORE THAN OKAY to reach out to supportive loved ones/friends about your issues. Who knows? One of them might make you feel a ton better.   

Edit: I am not condoning the usage of marijuana. This is just simply my story about a bout of depression I experienced. If you are medically depressed, I am also not condoning skipping of meds/holistic cures/not getting treated. Some people are born with chemical imbalances that medication can help with.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> **Meatballs**  

* 1 roll spicy country pork sausage   
* 1 roll spicy Italian sausage   
* Handful of chopped arugula   
* Large handful of cubed or shredded mozzarella   
* Sea salt to taste (I used smoked salt) 

Form meatballs and place in a hot skillet. Cook until halfway done  

**Broth**   

* 1 medium carrot 
* 4ish green onions   
* 1 stick of celery   
* 1/2 stick of butter   
* Bullion or broth of your choice  
* 1 Chayote squash  
* 1 chicken thigh, chopped ham, or bacon   
* 1 jalapeno   
* 1 gallon of water   
* Sea salt to taste

Get pot hot and toss in butter, chopped carrot, jalapeno, green onion, and celery. Mix occasionally and let it come together, about five minutes Chop chicken and add it, cook halfway and add the water. Add bullion to taste.

Toss in chopped squash and bring water to a good simmer. Let simmer until flavors come together. Add meatballs and grease from pan.   

Cook until meatballs are done.  

Dish, top with parmesan cheese and cilantro (or arugula if you don't like cilantro)  
**Enjoy!**  

The squash is about 4.5-5 net carbs   
Arugula is 2 carbs per cup  
Carrot about 3 carbs   
Celery is about 2 carbs   
Green onions are 2 per onion  

One pot of soup (21 - 24 carbs) made at least six bowls for me, so the carbs are spaced out pretty well (3.5-4 carbs per serving). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I there with you. I've had HBP since I was 18. I'm 25 now. Stress was an important factor but my HBP didn't go down until I changed my diet. 

I'm not sure what will work for you but I started cutting carbs out and it made a huge difference. I know it sounds weird because fat (for a long time) has been thought to cause heart problems. I have (in my experience) found it to be the opposite. I'm on a high-fat low-carb diet and I've never felt better. Keep in mind, I count calories too. Too many and you'll gain more weight. 

Everytime I mention the following subreddit I get downvoted, but you should check out /r/keto. Now ketosis is used mainly by super overweight people as a weight loss program (they'll lose like 20lbs a month). I'm a 5'9" 180lb male and I just use it as a diet program. I eat red meat, chicken, vegetables, etc. I try to eat a lot of fiber and healthy fats. It's helped my blood pressure and heart rate immensely. With the diet you lose out on potassium and magnesium and you'll have to take supplements. You also need to drink a lot of water. 

Exercise is important also. I try to walk everywhere I go but I'm not super active (I really should be).  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> TIFU by informing a neighbor of their death. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-03-23 05:56:05 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Like most TIFUs this didn't actually happen today. This happened 8 years ago. 

I grew up in the south Austin area and some new gang members from California had moved into the area. I wasn't involved in gang activity but I knew a lot of kids that were. 

One day I was walking home from a friends house and a truck pulls up to me with a couple of guys asking where my neighbor was. I told them I didn't know and they said that if I found out, let him know they're looking for him.

The next day in school I find out that they had a pistol on them and so I inform my neighbor's sister that they intend to kill her brother. I ask her to leave my name out of the mix when she confronts the principle about the problem but... she fails to do so.

A couple of days go by and I jump into bed and feel a cold piece of metal at my feet. I go to look at it and it's the head of a bullet. Then I start seeing holes in my walls. I lived in a trailer home (I had the middle most room, the trailer was facing the street [like this](http://i.imgur.com/d8zsEne.png)) and that bullet and two others had ripped through about 4 walls of my home. One hit a top bar of my bunk bed and fell into the bottom bunk. One ripped through the bathtub, my dresser drawer and landed in my box fan, and the other hit the bottom skirting of my house, landing underneath it. 

One bullet passed above me and my sister and the other below us. I never heard the shots (it must have been fired in the middle of the night a couple of nights before) and I never found out who did it. I called the cops, found the brass casings, but nothing ever came of it. We lived in the poor side of town so I didn't expect much. 

tl;dr: snitched and almost got stitched. 

Edit: Dangit! I meant to edit the title before I hit 'submit'. My neighbor ended up living. They backed off after his sister got the police and principle involved.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Over goddamn eggs </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-03-17 05:27:50 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> How the fuck could I let myself get all worked up over eggs?  

My SO and I live together with a 3rd roommate. We'll call my SO "Lilly" and our roommate "Cindy".  

Lilly and I pretty much share almost nothing. When we shop together I buy stuff I need and she buys stuff she needs. Now with certain products, we'll rotate purchase. Eggs especially. I'll buy them one time and she'll get the next time, etc.  

Recently she's been shadowing a teacher that has about 80 chickens and she will give Lilly a dozen almost every week. So now we don't have to buy eggs because we're getting a steady supply of delicious farm-fresh eggs... until right now.  

Spring break was last week so we didn't get our weekly dozen. When I checked the carton yesterday we had 2 left, enough for a breakfast. So this evening I'm getting all excited because I figure I'll eat the two tomorrow morning and then when Lilly and I go to the store tomorrow evening, I'll buy a dozen. So as we're winding down in bed I ask Lilly "hey, will you make sure I get up at 7:30 tomorrow? I want to eat breakfast." Now mind you, I'm not a big breakfast guy. I'm trying to get in the habit of it because I'm always so unproductive in the mornings.   

Lilly says "Sure, but there's only one egg left and I'm taking it for lunch tomorrow."   


WHAT. "Lilly, why didn't you tell me we were down to our last egg?"  

"Well you never eat breakfast, megabenson." (Fair point)

"But but... Dammit! Now I have go to the store now and buy more!"   

So I get up, put my shit on, and head outside to my car. Except I'm blocked in by Cindy and my next door neighbors and Cindy is fast asleep.   

I get so damn mad! OVER SOMETHING SO SMALL.   

Mind you, I wasn't mad at my SO. I was mad because now I'm going to be hungry tomorrow morning and all I have are a few slices of ham and 0 eggs...   

Man fuck this. So fucking stupid.   </TEXT>

The product key might be within the folder I placed those files into but that folder is on the broken HDD.

Edit: I'm not sure if it was a genuine copy or not. It didn't seem ripped because there were no special hoops he had to jump through. 

I think I might just have to buy another copy of it.  </TEXT>

For how old Windows 7 is, I don't think $100 is a reasonable price so I'm looking to you all for help with this matter. Maybe you know of a not-so-common software shop that has copies or maybe you know about decent sales going on around the internet.
