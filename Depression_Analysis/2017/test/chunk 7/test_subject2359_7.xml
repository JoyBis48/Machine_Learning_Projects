There's a difference between "occasionally goes below freezing during one season" and "gets below free 50% of days of the year."  It's in the latter case the electricity becomes much less economical.

It's the 1890 printing, and has a lot of really great illustrations.

It's been collecting dust on my shelf for twenty-five years, and I figure someone here might be interested in it for historical or decorative purposes.  **PM me** if so.

You'll want to read William Taubman's *Khrushchev* (2003), then.  The secret speech was the results of months of research instigated by Khrushchev, and largely written by him with help from a few others.  Written and re-written, and passed around the Presidium before it was delivered (by a day or two). Malenkov didn't seem to figure into it, and was already well on his way down, with the attempted coup sort of his last gasp. </TEXT>

or 

Udon noodles, finely chopped green onions, chicken or fried tofu, shredded cabbage, slivered almonds, and a dressing of sesame   peanut oil, soy sauce, crushed or powdered ginger, powdered garlic, lemon juice, rice vinegar, and fine-ground white pepper. </TEXT>

There's a greystone near the lightning tree, which Kvothe would be sure to notice at some point when dealing with the bandits.  And, most importantly, the lightning tree is on a hill, the bandit camp was in a small valley (a "bowl" as Kvothe describes it).

	<TEXT>  Bush came on TV and straight up said "Osama bin Laden. Afghanistan." Then a couple months later, it was just "Hussein. Iraq."

You sort of had to live through it - the right-wing media hate machine was in full force against anyone who questioned invading Iraq.  And a lot of Yellow Dogs (Democrats who voted for the war) spinelessly went along with it, making it that much easier to utterly demonize anyone who said so much "Hey, this just might possibly be a bad idea." </TEXT>

Although I do agree that Ambrose and his father are trying to murder their way to the throne.  Arranged shipwrecks and duels being the case so far, as well as trying to poison the Maer (and the Chancellor, making Hemme the new Chancellor). </TEXT>

Vashet specifically says that her poet-king was from the Small Kingdoms.  I think Kvothe kills both Ambrose *and* Roderic - the first gains his reputation as a "poet killer," the second his reputation as a "King-killer."  

The fact that Ambrose is a shitty poet doesn't matter.  Plenty of ass-kissers will likely play up his talent, making him into some kind of gifted poet. </TEXT>
