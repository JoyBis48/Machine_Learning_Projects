	<TEXT> I absolutely loved Chihayafuru (and the second season)! Japanese culture really interests me and I love anime they showcase different aspects of the culture, like Chihayafuru does with karuta. More than anything though I just love the characters and how much they love karuta and dedicate themselves to it! Makes me wish I played too :3 </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was the same, although in saying that I don't usually cry when watching anime or movies or whatever. YLIA definitely hit me right in the feels though!  </TEXT>
