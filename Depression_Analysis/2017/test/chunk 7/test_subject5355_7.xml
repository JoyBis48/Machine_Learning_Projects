	<TEXT> Crowd sourcing gives the ability for them to fail in the first place. Without it, games like Yooka Laylee and (I believe) FTL would never be given the chance to fail in the first place. The average person cannot raise the kinds of funds without some form of external investment.

Traditionally, this is capital markets or bank loans. Now we can add crowd sourcing to the list. 

It doesn't encourage laziness anymore than convincing some wealthy investors to give you money and squandering that. Either way you are ruining your own reputation and wasting resources provided externally. The encouragement to not be lazy is wealth.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When you form a company, you are often not the one investing either... This is why many company founders are often CEOs and not actual owners.

Crowd sourcing brings products to market that may not otherwise exist. They also do not require any given individual to bear a significant portion of the risk of the product/company as opposed to traditional investing. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's just a form of investment.

Capital markets have allowed technology and the quality of life to explode. 

Crowd funding isn't much different. Except the potential return/reward is a new product on the market instead of dividends.

Games like Yooka Laylee would not likely exceed of it depended on investors from acapital market, since they're riskier than CoD 18.

It's a fine system that is currently a little too open to abuse. But certainly not 'lazy' </TEXT>
