	<TEXT> so for most cases, people are sure they are failing and therefore ask whether to withdraw or take the F (the catch all answer is to most likely withdraw)

I can't find a case for where you are borderline passing: like hit or miss pass.

Should you take the course to its entirety (with the risk of potentially failing)? or just withdraw anyways?

I guess this is one of those gray areas. Give me what you think, if there is no generalized catch-all answer. Consider/factor in financial aid. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I honestly believe my csing is really bad;
positioning but that's team fighting phase, although I do have to deal with skillshots and stuff as well during laning; the only thing that bothers me in mid lane is getting ganked since I do try to be aggressive (force the opponent mid lane out and you also kinda need to do that vs 'weak early game').

also, what sort of champion is considered high difficult in mid? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> how does one practice mid lane? </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> the reason I am asking this is because it is the most popular lane (we're talking about normals here) and well, if you get it to practice and happen to not do well, you screw up everyone else's experience.

the only good thing is if I don't want it, usually someone else will take it (ranked) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree, otherwise most people would fit into genderfluid and thus invalidate the whole identity anyways

no person ever fully feels male or fully female, exclusively... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> it simply doesn't

the only thing it has any effect is my personality which is what I want people to care about (except my partner)

my personality: very compassionate and friendly (sometimes it scares people), not afraid to say I love them but you know: people think I say I'm in love with them and just all around (try to be) funny person. </TEXT>
