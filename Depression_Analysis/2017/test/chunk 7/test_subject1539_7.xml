Just starting the 'Last Survivor - Ellen Ripley' add-on now, so atmospheric wandering around the 'set' of Alien and hearing Lambert scream at the start - chilling.

	<TEXT> here are some Irish sites

First up, blogs.telegraph.co.**uk**

tell me more about 'how i know nothing about Ireland'

I just have, but here are some more, children in Ireland are not taught anti-semetic or anti-Israel anything in any official sense.

That some schools take their own view, bear in mind your examples are based in very religious areas of Ireland, isn't right but then we don't check out schools every day with every teacher and I doubt any country does.

Though in my schooling, the very same system, we were given a very positive view of Israel and Israelis.

I still have a fantastic series of jewish artwork on my walls reprinted from a very old jewish calendar. My brother spent considerable time in kibbutz and is still in contact with people he met there.

I still can't believe you think a .uk is an Irish site, are you trolling yourself?

With regard to your sources, there are practically all blogs and opinion pieces. </TEXT>

I didn't have to do anything 'exotic' with XBMC, yet have all the advantages of a central store and I created a home-server at the same time.

Though, more seriously, your point about the courts is well taken.

If the pay, pensions etc. to people such as Kerins and Flanney were simply stopped - they would have to go to the courts to get satisfaction.

So in turn providing an opportunity to explain in front of a judge and the country why the government feels uncomfortable giving them any more money in light of their actions.

It is the public airing of these issues that makes K   F squirm - the government doesn't seem to scare them at all. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> To be exact, the internet does nothing of the kind.

It's people who populate the echo chambers, exhibiting a behaviour that no internet law will really curtail and is prevalent everywhere.

After ~20 years of the web, we're still getting used to the audience our conversations and posts can have but we were always having these conversations.

Plus, unsavoury ideas are much better out in the open, where they can be seen and argued against. </TEXT>

It's a great time for parents   kids to remind themselves that on-line fora / chat-boards are not reality and need to be taken with a pinch-of-salt.

Bullying is another matter, but one that is actually easier to solve in its on-line forms than its IRL forms. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This part is also comical:

The internet may be socialising young people into near-absolute conformity when they have not yet developed sufficient maturity to realise what is happening

And Rock Music will lead to Satanism, yadda yadda yadda ...

Nevermind taking it as an argument to remove religion from students' school education as **it may** create a near-absolute conformity when they have not yet developed sufficient maturity to realise what is happening.

It's another missed opportunity from Breda to have a sensible debate or write a coherent piece on the variety of influences that are literally at everyone's fingertips, not only the school-aged.

All those column inches, to end with the stunning insight that parents should really parent. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Useless.

I was in a minor fender-bender the other week, 3 distinctly different cars.

After 15 minutes getting everyone's tax details etc., the Senior Garda still didn't know which car belonged to who and accused one of the drivers of giving him incorrect info. Until it was pointed out to him that he was looking at the wrong car.

Never mind the Ban Garda sent out around the town on her own, got a coat thrown over her and beaten up. She was sent out on her own again a few weeks later.

A local thug who assaulted a Garda in the station yet is still free as a bird. Though there's also a laundry list of property damage and assault cases against him.

Utterly bloody useless.
