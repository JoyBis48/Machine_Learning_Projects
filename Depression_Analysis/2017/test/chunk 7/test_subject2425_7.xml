	<TITLE> What ever happened to the "battery saving" m5 coprocessor tweak? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> I heard about a tweak the first week of the iOS 7 jailbreak on r/jailbreak that enabled everything going to the a5 processor on the iPhone 5s to be routed to the m5 processor instead. This in turn is supposed to make the phone a little bit laggy, but give amazing battery life. About two weeks later, somebody asked the same question as i am asking here, but it went undiscussed. Does anybody know anything about it? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Legion Commander! Nice loops, do you use cinema 4d to do this? Doesn't that require some pretty powerful hardware? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Multiple people at my school have iPhones and it is nice to be able to share a gif or photo/link without having to know their contact/number. I use it a ton. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The fingerprint scanner has never worked for me, I've always looked at it as a gimmick. But apparently, it works for 98% of the people at my school and on /r/jailbreak. The only way I'm using it now is with the new touch home app. It sends you to the home screen or multitasking switcher by just placing(not pushing) your finger on the home button, no touch id required.  </TEXT>
