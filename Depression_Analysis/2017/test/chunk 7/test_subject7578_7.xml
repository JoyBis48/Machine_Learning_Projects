	<TEXT> I partially agree they're not perfect films but i dont take them small criticisms and use them to say they're terrible like everyone else. I THINK they're very good films.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> If you could, which 2 Pixar movies would you crossover? </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'd do a Toy Story and Monsters Inc crossover. It's the only one i could think of that wouldn't need any convenient plot points to get the characters together. Say Mike or Sulley goes into Bonnie's bedroom one night, the toys wake and "the adventure begins" so to speak. what would you do? (no hate) </TEXT>
