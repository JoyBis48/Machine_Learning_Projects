	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm 18   5'7", I'm still growing but I'm worried that doing gymnastics/tumbling will close my growth plates. The doctor said I could potentially reach 5'8", possibly taller so I want to optimize my growth as much as possible. Is there any scientific evidence or study that supports gymnastics/tumbling does not link to stunted growth? On the surface, it might have some truth as it seems many gymnasts aren't very tall.

I really want to learn how to be more acrobatic and do flips, aerials, roundoff back handsprings, etc. but I'd go against it if it means not growing any taller. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Very informative answer. Thank you very much. I wanted to buy a snazzy Uniform from my school so I can stop wearing the basic dobok you get at your first lesson. I've bought all my sparring gear from my Dojang but to get the Mooto Extera S5 Uniform (The same one my Master and his children wear along with the advanced students, minus the black trim of course) from them would cost $150 as opposed to buying it online for $99 on Amazon. If it was within a $20- maybe $30 price difference I would go to my Dojang to help support my school. But a $50 difference is out of my budget. I wouldn't imagine it would be an issue but hopefully my master doesn't take it personally.

And yeah! I didn't think wearing a white collar dobok to training as a black belt would be a problem. But definitely keep it formal with the black trim for events such as gradings and competitions, etc. thanks for reconfirming my opinion.

If I may ask, what kind of Dobok do you sport?

	<TEXT> That makes sense, I've heard the same theory regarding white belts fading to black belts. In your dojang, are all colored belts limited to only the White V-neck? And is it considered informal for a Black Belt to wear a White V-Neck?

I don't want to spend a lot of money on quality white-collar uniforms if I can't wear them anymore as a Black Belt. </TEXT>

Let's be real, there's some shitheads in every ethnical group and culture but there's obviously a prominent amount of amongst Blacks than in others in comparison. Largely attributed to their history of growing up in poverty and in the ghetto and what not but that's still not a good excuse to be a shithead.

	<TITLE> Why is there limited punching in Traditional Martial Arts? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-06-18 12:11:32 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Even styles that incorporate head punches (EX: ITF TKD) limit themselves in what kind of punches they do and how frequently they practice. Many of those fighters don't ever even learn proper punching mechanics. And by TMA's I mean styles such as variations of Karate and Taekwondo.

In many styles of Karate, the only punch that is practiced against a resisting opponent is the reverse punch which is the only punch that actually scores in Taekwondo.

Punching techniques are ridiculously limited when compared to styles such as Western Boxing, Muay Thai, or American Kickboxing.

Watching /u/LawrenceKenshin's videos of Karate   TKD practitioners enter Kickboxing-esque competition really shows how flawed and porous their punching technique is. 

Obviously, this does not apply to every practitioner but it seems like the majority of them out there have very bad punching. 

tl;dr: Is there a reason that many TMA's put much more emphasis on kicks than punches? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Okay, holy shit. So I was about 6 or 7 years old and I was just chilling in my parents' room by myself while everyone was out in the living room watching Spider-Man 2. My parents' room has a door that leads out to the backyard and while watching TV, a FUCKING RAT the size of my 4 year old cousin just scrams through the room and out into the hallway. I immediately follow after it and as it was passing I looked into the other rooms with doors open in the hallway to see if anyone else noticed it. 

It ran out into living room and went straight behind the big TV (the Big TV was right next to the entrance to the living room so it didn't have to travel far). I was freaking surprised that NO ONE NOTICED IT THOUGH. My mom, my aunts, and my cousin were chilling on the couch and no one noticed it.

I had my dad take a quick look behind the TV and we couldn't find anything. 12 years later and I'm still very positive that I saw something... I swear, it wasn't an "overactive imagination" or "I was seeing things" I SAW something. Something black. I'm not sure if it was a rat but it was pretty big.

My dad thought I was crazy and they still remember that too but I knew I saw something. I really wish I spoke up about it when I saw it... maybe I could've gotten another witness.

I still wonder where it went from time to time. </TEXT>
