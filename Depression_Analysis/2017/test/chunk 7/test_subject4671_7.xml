	<TEXT> I would like to point you towards reddit.com/r/allthingsterran :)


1. i transfer 4-6 ish, once my first command center is slightly below saturation i point both cc's towards second (or maybe even my third)

2. As I low down my 4th cc i tend to stop making scvs. I'm looking for an army of 60-75 ish supply most the time.

3. terran drops? usually a about 3 well placed turrets on corner of you bases will stop most but you can obviously play super safe with more. for zergling counter attacks i make a wall at natural and at 3rd ramps with bunkers by each(usually with 3 marines inside)

4. Thats a really broad question. go over to the allthingsterran subreddit and check out the [build guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/AllThingsTerran/comments/1c9gbb/gosubuilds_update_1_month_after_hots/) </TEXT>

All the new WCS action will be available on twitch.tv in free 720p but VODS might be behind a pay wall(similar to OGNLol). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The first thing I noticed about dalomar when he questiones the group was that he said lower LEVELS(plural). The group only went down one level so that clues me in to them missing something. Also, dalomar seemed relatively uninterested in the book and more interested in the contents on the keep. This leads me to believe the book was a red herring used to get the party to find something else.

I've noticed that sense the party visited dalomar that towns people have been swindling them and giving them distance. Ryan thought this was respect but I view it as fear...obviously the people are afraid of the group since they started talking with dalomar.

I think everything dalomar gave them was exactly form that script(wizards don't haphazardly do anything...just ask gandolf). The arrows and rope were supposed to be used to create a path for the party not touching the floor to not spring and traps, the oil for the acid coins, the torches BC he knew they would be descending levels into darkness, etc </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm a 5'11" , 190lb skinny-fat male. For the past month, I've been practicing my fork put downs(1800 cals, 50% p, 30% c, 20% f). as well as working out 5 days a week.

  M-max chest 3x5, chest accesory work, tricep work
  T-Max squat 3x5, more squats...even more squats. calf raises
  W-max deadlift 1x5, dumbbell deadlifts, rows, bicep curls
  R-Max OHP 3x5, shoulder press, lateral raise, upright rows, Max shrugs
  F-HIIT/core

Two questions:
1. Why is my weight not changing? Do i need to cut calories more? is my 30% carbs too much? Do i need more cals so my body doesn't hold in fat(that feels brosciency)
2. All my workouts last a little over an hour. sometimes i'm soaked with sweat(see leg day) and other times I feel a pump but don't sweat...does that mean i need to work out harder/longer on those days </TEXT>

	<TEXT> definitely check r/p90x out. I did it last year and lost 20 lbs and toned up a bit. ANd don't listen to the naysayers  you can definitely gain strength doing it if you push hard and keep trying to up your weights </TEXT>
