	<TITLE> 23/M Looking for an accountability buddy for waking up early </TITLE>

	<TEXT> It's simple really. I think if you wake up early you get extra hours in your day and can perform better. I have had accountability buddies in the past and it went out quite well for a few months. 
I try to wake up at 5 am everyday which requires sleeping on time too. 
If you aim at waking up at 6 or 7 am, it's fine by me. I know 5 am is a bit freakish. 

How the accountability shall work -

The moment we wake up we take a photo of our wrist watch along with a piece of paper on which we write "I am awake" 
Why?
Coz it generally means you're out of the bed now. 

If interested let me know. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think it's been a year since I broke up with my ex-gf. I have a tattoo of her name on my body which I intend to remove as soon as I get my finances right. It was a bad decision to get it in the first place, but...eh...mistakes happen. 

I have suffered a lot in the past few months. But having no contact with my ex has helped me a lot in moving on. It would have been even better had she not messaged me at all. She used to message me like once a week or something and I could see the display pic of her hugging her new boyfriend. She moved on very quickly after we broke up. That fact tormented me a lot.

Anyway, I'm in a better mental state now and it's been a life changing experience. I just want to say that if you're suffering right now then, just know that it will end one day and you will be able to breathe. 

There will come a day when you won't wake up in the morning with the thought of your ex in your head and the memories will begin to fade away. Just hang in there. Also if you focus on reading and some outdoor activities, it'll just help more. 

Both good times and bad times end one day.  </TEXT>
