	<TEXT> I am looking for two Saturday tickets! I have Friday tickets, but I am a HUGE conner and would be super bummed to only go one day. I unfortunately lived 3000 miles away when I initially bought my ticket on a hunch I'd be back East by now...

Get me two Saturday tickets and I can throw you some swag I have leftover from my days working at Marvel. Or a carrot cake. Or some nice beer--your choice! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> it was pretty delicious. It did take about an hour, but it is cost effective. I'm hoping once we've better at it that we can do it in 30 min, in which I think it's be worth the savings :) </TEXT>
