	<TEXT> Right now I'm playing a rather persuasive gentleman and I have recently outgrown the minor poet occupation. I checked a few wiki articles and found the career branch I would like to follow is the journalist route.

To gain access to this route you must receive a random event that gives you access to this. To acquire this even you must have a certain amount of Connected:Bohemian, however, I lack the right connections. Is there any way to quickly gain Connected: Bohemian? If so, what is it? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I Think the reason why so many Americans, as well as myself, are against the idea of paying the tax because it's non-optional and it's very likely it won't benefit you.

Think about it, if you're a young American who has no real health problems and rarely needs to go to the doctor then why would you want to pay for a service you're most likely never going to need? Or even worse, if you're someone who is struggling to get by paying for things like rent or food, then how are you going to survive when you're now being forced to pay for health insurance?

And then there's the fact that people who have health insurance would never want to switch to national healthcare, think of these peoples mentality's, it goes from "I make money and i'm successful so I can ensure that if I ever get hurt I'll get proper medical care" to "I make money and i'm successful so now I have to pay for other people to get medical care.

Really I think you just need to look at it from all the perspectives you can think of and realize that to a lot of them national healthcare is unappealing and it's not just them being evil and mean. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey guys, so I just fucked up a few minutes ago, lemme explain.

It's 2 in the morning and i'm 16, I have my own room and laptop, it's a simple laptop, a chromebook, but it does what I need it to do. However, I'm also a heavy listener of music and as such have a nice pair of over the ear headphones. So i come into my room, I had just gotten back from using the bathroom after trying to fall asleep for the past four hours, but try as I might I can't sleep.

As I come back into my room I decide that sleep isn't happening so I instead opt to go to grab my computer and surf the web. I begin surfing and after a while I decide to put on some music, I check to make sure my headset is plugged in. Now, my headset has two plugs a USB and an audio/mic cable. I can feel that it's plugged into the USB port but the audio cable isn't plugged in so I quickly fix that, however my chromebook only has one input that works as either a mic port or an audio out port.

I plug in the audio cable, not really looking, and pull up [this.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IwmYAdgU18) The song starts up and I notice it's a bit quiet, so I bump up the volume on my chromebook until it's at full volume, at this point it's listenable and I'm pleasantly rocking out. About 2 minutes later my dad bursts into the room, yelling at the top of his lungs about how he has work tomorrow and I need to turn that down immediately.

I'm confused for a moment before I look down and notice that... My mic cable was plugged in instead of my audio out cable.
Since I had noise cancelling headphones I hadn't noticed them yelling at me to turn it off, and I hadn't noticed that it was so quiet even at max volume because I had those on...

TL;DR: Mix up mic input and audio output cables for my headset and end up blasting Rock music at full volume at 2:00 in the morning. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So, I'm making my first map and when I upload it it get's all glitchy. I checked online on how to make borders and it showed them using the division, whereas when I drew it I drew the borders of every province without using division in inkscape. Does this mean I did it wrong and have to re-do the whole thing using the division method, or is there a way I can salvage my map?

BTW. From what I can figure, the problem is that in Inkscape the borders for all the objects overlap, creating problems with the borders. </TEXT>
