	<TEXT> I tried looking this place up, but I only saw a short 4 mile loop. Is that what you're doing? Or is there more there. I ask because I live in Sacramento and am always looking for trails to ride :)  I've done American River, Sacramento River, Santa Rosa area, a lot in SF, and in Davis.  </TEXT>
