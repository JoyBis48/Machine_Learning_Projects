	<TEXT> *What's the problem?*   
  I closed firefox today and restarted (as I have had to do several times now) and lost all my shortcuts. This is the second time I have lost them but not the second time I have had to restart firefox for an issue. This doesn't happen when firefox crashes. Just when I quit/force quit.

*What other browser extensions are installed?*  
  Adblocker and ghostery.

*Did you read the known issues and search /r/RESissues?*  
  Yes. I found an issue from a year ago which related to a file on windows. I am on a mac, have most updated version of this software, and am not sure it applies here.

I also get the tips again popping up, so yes, I am sure some file somewhere is being toasted with my settings. Do I need to write a script to back it up several times a day as different names or will a future version do this?

Me: "You're not seeing anyone else right now are you?"

Her: "Uh, no."

Me: "Neither am I. And since we are here together, going to get some food, I guess it means we are seeing each other now."

Her: "Uh. Well, yes. I really can't argue with that."

sometime later on a trip home from visiting relatives for the holiday...

Me: "Ya know, since we hang out a lot and you have nothing better to do and neither do I, why don't we get married?"

Me: "You pick, I'm easy."

	<TEXT> Here's how it works with some conservatives:

 In addition to floating the new bike tax, the budget currently under consideration would repeal the states Complete Streets law. The policy, which mandates that all new road construction and repairs take cyclists and pedestrians into consideration, makes up only about $190,000, or six-one-thousandths of one percent of the total transportation budget

Now he will cut and cut and cut to the point it hurts even more. So when a dem runs part of their platform, to bring things back to sanity, is to spend. Then cons will point and say 'look, tax and spend liberals!' 

All the while, these same cons, are for spending more on weapons and wars (which they don't always put on the books....) Which, oddly enough, you never heard them discuss raising taxes to pay for (can you imagine the response by the right if cons has asked for a tax increase to pay for the wars? Suddenly they would all be like 'naw, we're safe enough').

So, what happens (again) is they increase spending for wars/weapons, cut the budget for things we really want and need, and then claim there is no money to pay for those things. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ah the rich. They work so much harder than others. You can work 60 hours a week in one job, 20 in another, and 10 on sunday and you are still being a lazy worthless bum. Hard work means money (just ask any conservative). These people are far superior to us because they busted their asses and still are 1000 hours a week.

So sure, we should listen to their ideals. They are intellectually superior and much harder workers. What have you done for America? How many factories have you closed and how many slave laborer children have you been able to put to work in the world?

Like moses they have the led the money from it's bondage in our country to freedom and tax havens elsewhere. They have climbed the mountain of the golden calf and brought down to us the tablets, phones, and shoes from the right hand of the children of Vietnam.

Verily I say unto you, the great wealth wielders of this country have shown us the way to the promised land which flows with golden showers from above, you will come to it from shit creek, upon which you will need no paddle. 

And there, at border to this land of slave labor for all, at the land where your money where no longer burden your pockets but instead will be lifted up to become the burden of the rich....there you will the rulers they have chosen to allow you to choose from.

Go now, and spread the good news.... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Here is their basic ideal (and why it is a sham):

We can all own our own businesses and with hard work can be rich.

If everyone owned a business, who would work for them?? We need workers.

The people in this country who get the most work the least. If we all worked 60 hours a week we all still wouldn't be making the same amount of money. So it isn't about "Hard Work". It never has been.

Those who do the actual work, the workers, at times ask for the same things investors do - a return on their 'investment'. But the right calls workers greedy when they do and whine about how prices could go up.

Investors want the same thing and prices go up? The right cheers that on as capitalism. </TEXT>

But I suppose we should keep that in mind when creating budgets (unless the treaty is with Indians, we generally don't honor those ones and are still screwing them over like McCain recently did).

It would be interesting to know exactly what all obligations we have and under what conditions. I am sure such things have an impact, somewhere along the line, on legislation, planning, funding, etc.

	<TEXT> The constitution is like the bible. People interpret it a lot of ways.

One of the core ideals is that we have a collective interest in the security of the country. And foreign powers aren't the only thing which is a threat to the nation. Pollution from one state can easily cross state lines and impact others and deprive them of their rights, affect their health, well being, ability to farm, produce, etc. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think things should be a case by case basis at times.

Pot - is something an individual does that affects themselves. And while some can argue it has broader consequences that is over broad and not consistent.

Fracking - a broader issue that can affect many people (like pollution) on a broad scale. I would be against a federal ban but for federal regulations on the safety/environmental impact side of things.


It is, in some ways, pretty simple. What impact does X have on 'we the people'. If it impacts just the people doing it, meh, okay, have fun. As the scope of the action increases so should scrutiny and regulations to minimize negative impacts. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> From the article:

 A few maverick Republicans even argue that the cable network has become so powerful that it's become a problem for the party, not an advantage. Bruce Bartlett, a former aide to President Reagan, wrote recently that Fox allows conservatives to engage in self-brainwashing and may have contributed to Mitt Romney's 2012 defeat by making Republicans complacent about the victory they expected.

"Self Brainwashing", I think, is quite fitting for that crowd. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The more laws you have, the more law breakers you have.

How many laws do Americans break a day? From speeding to pirated movies/music, to selling VHS tapes you have of old shows at a garage sale you didn't get a permit for and didn't put down on your taxes to....well, just about everything.

I am guessing that almost every US citizen has broken the law more than once. We only take notice of those the government chooses to prosecute. And then we make their life hell - from making it hard to get a job, loans, etc.

If you want to break the law - just call yourself a corporation. At least then the most you usually get is a fine which is less than the money you made from your crimes. </TEXT>

"Foundation **took**" - no, some groups/people donated.

I can see the super smart conservatives now "Why, a smart charity like the ones I donate to, would refuse all money coming in to it in case someone, somewhere, associated with that money has problems later!"

Those same 'smart' folks rush to donate money to cops who shoot unarmed people and businesses that brag about discriminating.

	<TEXT>  Optimism about Libya reached its apogee in July 2012, when democratic elections brought to power a moderate, secular coalition governmenta stark change from Qaddafis four decades of dictatorship. But the country quickly slid downhill. Its first elected prime minister, Mustafa Abu Shagour, lasted less than one month in office. His quick ouster foreshadowed the trouble to come: as of this writing, Libya has had seven prime ministers in less than four years. Islamists came to dominate the first postwar parliament, the General National Congress. Meanwhile, the new government failed to disarm dozens of militias....

Sooo.... What we have is a country with democratic elections, they elected people, and it didn't work out.

Just wait - if we get a conservative in power they will call up Libya and say:

**Hi, I'm a conservative from the American Government, and we're here to help**

	<TEXT> I lived there off and on since 1996 (not there now), and yeah - I remember it coming up here and there. It always seemed so regressive.

If a majority of vehicles used no gas I could see replacing the gas tax for roads with something like this (but one would also note that most likely cars would weigh less and do less damage).

It all reminds me of a story about a town in Canada. They were using a lot of electric and generating more was going to be a problem. Might have to raise rates to get an expensive new generator and get online, etc. So they pushed people hard to conserve energy, buy more energy efficient appliances, etc. 

They did. So much so that not only did they reduce electric usage by a ton but revenue fell. Which meant less money to maintain the grid/production. So....they raised prices. 

There is a stable point where a system pays for itself. Prices go up to cover the cost of maint. and such, but oddly, it seems wages never seem to match. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Let me try to give a broad view on this. I went to school back in the 1970's here (elementary school). We had Christmas plays, songs, decorations, etc in my school. We also had one Jewish kid in my class and learned about Hanukkah and had some decorations for that up.

As kids, it was what we knew in real life and this was just an extension of that. I wasn't in a diverse area at the time (religiously/racially). 

The problem comes in, imho, in that such things can be exclusive and also opens a door to other things. The religious right in this country hates anything that isn't Christian centered. So if schools celebrated holidays of say, Muslims, they would prattle on about terrorism, isis, indoctrination, etc and so on. Not to mention if some students were atheist and don't celebrate any of those holidays in a religious manner.

As done here, it excludes people who aren't Christian. What has been happening is that other groups (satanic temple, muslims, etc) have leveraged the rules to get in on the 'action' and now Christians are starting to feel what others felt all along. They don't want their kids exposed to religious ideals outside of the ones they choose at home.

Personally I think it can be educational to be more diverse in schools - the issue in some cases though is that the leaders of the school are participating with a captive audience. If you have your morning announcements filled with bible verses/prayer (as I experienced) you have people in power subjugating kids to their ideals/beliefs. A public school draws on a diverse population and those who work there shouldn't be pushing their beliefs on kids.

Schools are for educating, not pontificating your personal religious ideals. They have things called Churches for that.  </TEXT>

You can sit here all day showing them proof in the bible about the first murder and it won't move em a bit. If you want to really upset them - tell em that god is the one who controls the weather and if tornados/floods/etc hit towns (usually because someone somewhere in the US likes gay people and lets them have freedom and life) - they will insist they have 'climate science', 'weathermen', etc who can 'predict' the weather. You can't predict when god will judge sinners (note: divorce, drinking, eating shrimp, etc aren't sins - just being gay is).

Folks like us, we are absolute geniuses compared to them, we know the truth. Git r done!
