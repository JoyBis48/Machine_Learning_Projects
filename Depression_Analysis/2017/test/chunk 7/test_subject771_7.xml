	<TEXT> I haven't driven distracted since I was 19, and drove my car into a 12 foot deep ditch because I was trying to read my mail while driving down the road.  My car was undamaged, but a 2 ton truck Avista had to pull me out.  Good thing I knew Gravy or that would have been a hell of a tow bill.  I don't text and drive, or use my phone and drive.  The most I'll "read" while driving down the road is printed off instructions on how to get where I'm going.  And I do that at red lights.  (what's going to happen there?  They'll honk at me to tell me the light's green now?) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> OK, what if the lady offered a BJ or whatever, and the dude said, "What are you, some kind of pervert?  I just want a date with a movie and dinner, pretend to enjoy my company is all I ask, not a blowjob or a handjob.  Does this look like the plot of FMJ?!  $150/hr lady.  Take it or leave it!"

**edit:**  For that much money, I would pretend to be gay, but the most "sexual contact" that would ever ever happen is holding hands, and even then I'm wearing sun glasses so I can't easily be IDed as a "queer"  (word spreads fast around town, and I don't want to be known as a "queer".  Oh god, dudes hitting on me, no thanks shudders.  There's a VERY significant difference between tolerance, (I tolerate whining kids on the aeroplane); acceptance, ( I accept the fact that global climate change may be influenced by mankind), and celebration, I celebrate the 4th of july with explosives that are legal only only 3 days out of the year).

I accept homosexuals, (just like you and me), but am I going to ever applaud butt-fucking as the superbowl sunday show [if it ever happened], NO!  I don't care if it was a dude-dude, chick-dude, or chick-chick.  I'd rather watch a literal monkey fucking a football than that, (and I would still change the channel) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> OK, I'm starting to think that these escort services like I treat "designer drugs".  Yeah, they're legal, but can fuck your life up?  I won't touch "designer drugs" with a 12 foot pole, (and I have one), because I had to sit through my neighbor pounding on my door at 0200 because he thought he was going to die.  That was enough to scare me off of that idea.  Fuck "designer drugs".  He refused the ambulance several times even though he was scared shitless.  I went to sleep before he did, but when I woke up the next "day", (all of 1.5 hrs later)  I rolled him over with my foot and said "hey, still alive?"  He grumbled and asked "where am I?"  I told him the address and said "you're alive.  Go home.  Whatever you did, don't do it again"  

You can stay here until 1200, then I expect you to make the journey back home of all of 20 feet"  He said "20 feet?"  can you help me to my couch?  I said "not a problem.  Where's your keys?"  He said  "I have keys?"  I said, "Umm let me check your house".  it was unlocked, so I just opened up the door as wide as it would go, and went and got him.  I lied and told him, "you left them in the lock, your house is open, I'll take you home."  He agreed, so I plopped him on his couch, locked the door behind me, and went to work. Dumbass high guy from Lithuania.  I should have called an ambulance.

Still, he refused medical treatment, so from my understanding there's nothing I can do.  I must have asked him 15 or 16 times if he wanted to go to the hospital.  He kept on refusing treatment, so from what I remembered from first aid training, I couldn't do anything until he went unconscious, (but I did first because of being tired).

**TL;DR;**  Fuck designer drugs.  I had one scare with that shit, that's enough for me.. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I honestly don't know how.  I've tried bars, I've tried work, I've tried old FB friends that I used to know 20 years ago.  Got shot down at every one of them.  I know of "why buy the cow when you can get the milk for free", but I can't seem to find any cattle around here, and this steer, (i've had a vasectomy, so keeping with the analogy), still misses the company of a cow.  (and I don't mean fat chicks either). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My dad cut me off in 1999 because I was using too much of his internet time and hogging the phone line, so I ran my own line, and blueboxed an open frequency, and slam dialed every ISP in the Union to get a connection, and started dialing.  I eventually got through to an ISP in Topeka, KS, and I was caught in 2 hours because I only wanted free internet access without tying up my dads phone line.  (I stopped blue boxing, but I kept the phone line).   Everything about what I did was completely illegal, but I was  16 at the time, (I think that's the only reason they let it go, and I convinced them that I had no clue what was going on.)  My dad knew exactly what was going on.  He opened up the camper and said "XXXXXX, you need to take this call NOW.  It's the FBI!"  I knew exactly why I was getting the call.  Not doing that again.  (OK, I was cracking, not hacking).  But I didn't do it for commercial purposes, just "I want free internet".  (defrauding a public utility).  Yes, I kept the phone line, and now my home ranch has 2 lines. :) ) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sweet. :)  Now to get rich enough to actually do it.  Doing it the old fashioned way doesn't seem to work.  ( I mean actually getting them interested in you, not handjobs).  I tried to get somebody on a date from my FB contacts that I haven't seen for over 20 years, and I think I got shot down).  She's a good internet friend, and lives less than 2 miles away from me, but I just want to go have a picnic in the park, (and I don't mean oral sex), not bang her, and still I get shot down). </TEXT>

He just told me to go home, and I can't lay down in public in parking lots, the street, or sidewalks..  (and he thought I was odd because I was looking at the moon in binoculars.  I think he thought I was a peeping tom or something.) </TEXT>

Yes, I got stopped because they wondered why I was swerving.  They asked why I wasn't looking at the road, and I said "because an almost naked lady".  They just told me "In the future, watch where you're actually going, and don't oogle women.  You're free to go." </TEXT>

He broke down, and was trying to flag somebody down to take him to a petrol station, and I happened to walk out my door at the time, and saw he neded help, so I approached, and it turns out he ran out of gas.  I towed him back to work with my Blazer.  We've been hanging out at each other's houses and watching TV together, and we drink each other's beer. :)  He wants to take me fishing this summer, (if I tow, he doesn't have a hitch), and he's willing to pay for the gas to get to the river.

	<TEXT> I agree with the fans, most are a bunch of rhinestone cowboys, (or all hat and not cattle), but the music itself is decent.  And it's not like country has a monopoly on monotonous themes.  

Ever heard a rap song?  It's about how much life in the ghetto sucks, (to get down to it), pimps, drugs, "hoes", or shooting cops, or other black people, and the N-word is used a lot, or shooting up who knows what.  

Rock is "drugs, sex, and rock and roll"

Classic Music is mostly about God and Nature, and war stories.

Country is about pickup trucks, God, TV, 9/11, America Is Best, Hard Working men, Urbanization, etc.

Death metal is about being pissed off.

Classic rock (like pink floyd's "Dark Side of the Moon, or "The Wall"), is mostly a life story, but also drugs, sex, and rock and roll.

Blues is how much life sucks, regardless of where you are from

Bluegrass?  I haven't figured out that one yet.

Pop music?  I love a dude, and he doesn't love me back.  I just want to dance, etc. </TEXT>

That would actually cause a fire, and severely maim (or kill) whoever tripped the wire.

No, I have no intention of doing that.  I don't have a beef with anybody.  So burning your own house down and sitting there with an AK makes no sense at all. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's fucked up.  People wire their house to blow up?  What the hell?  And what the fuck is wrong with the dude that stayed in his house after it got torched.  Fire = get the hell out.  I don't care whether it's the cops, or the neighbor pounding on my door in that circumstance.  I'll go investigate, then get the fuck out.  I was in a house fire in 2001, and ran outside with no pants on to see how bad it was.  Wasn't too bad, so I went back inside and put pants on.  By the time I got out again (maybe 30 seconds), the entire upstairs was engulfed. </TEXT>

Legislated to give the freed black slaves after the Civil War rights comparable to the unalienable constitutional rights of white state citizens. The benefits of U.S. citizenship are received by consent in exchange for freedom. State citizens consequently take steps to revoke and rescind their U.S. citizenship and reassert their de jure common-law state Feucitizen status. This involves removing one's self from federal jurisdiction and relinquishing any evidence of consent to U.S. citizenship, such as a Social Security number, driver's license, car registration, use of ZIP codes, marriage license, voter registration, and birth certificate. Also included is refusal to pay state and federal income taxes because citizens not under U.S. jurisdiction are not required to pay them. Only residents (resident aliens) of the states, not its citizens, are income-taxable, state citizens argue. And as a state citizen land owner, one can bring forward the original land patent and file it with the county for absolute or allodial property rights. Such allodial ownership is held "without recognizing any superior to whom any duty is due on account thereof" (Black's Law Dictionary). Superiors include those who levy property taxes or who hold mortgages or liens against the property.[14]

Yep, it sounds like they think they are their own nation state.  That's fucked up man. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Most shootings occur with gang-on-gang violence, and they're not supposed to have them in the first place.  It's already illegal to either supply felons with weapons, be a felon in a possession of a weapon, or do straw man purchases, or modify firearms to be automatic, or to alter the serial number, or import without a VERY thorough investigation, or a whole lot of other shit. (See 18 USC Section 922 for further details.  Yes, subsection (r), is pumb fucking stupid, but the law is the law.) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No, people shouldn't be forced to carry a weapon if they don't want to, (or don't know how to use it, then they shouldn't).  I'm just saying that "GUN FREE" = "Victim disarmament".  Gun control only disarms the people who are willing to stay within the law, not the criminal element.  When is the last time you heard of somebody holding a gun to somebody's head with the express intent of killing them, only to say "wait, murder is illegal, I better not do it or I'll go to prison"?  Never.

But if people had a chance to shoot back, these mass murders wouldn't happen.  I agree with you completely on the lack of professional journalism in the USA.  That's why I watch BBC, and listen to France24.  The only time I even am exposed to American "Journalism" is in my truck, and I keep it tuned to KQQQ and KQZB. </TEXT>
