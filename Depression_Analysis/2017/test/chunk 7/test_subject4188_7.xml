	<TITLE> New Episode Themes </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Which direction will the new episodes take then, will they go straight paranormal as that always worked, will it all be aliens, how about some spooky episodes with horror thrown in, will it be from canon or will it be new ideas, there has to be some bridging from the last films / series but instead of getting bogged down I think it's best to kind of forget some past events and tell new stories, that way it's not getting drawn back too much and will let the new stories shine </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Is Bullock Bollocksed? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-07-12 23:28:40 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> It seems he has a murky past, a dead end job, no missus and now Gordan taking the limelight

I wonder where Bullock is going, will he stay canon or will they throw in a newbie to complete him

Gordon has all the luck, drive and women just falling at his feet, Bullock is most definitely bollocksed </TEXT>
