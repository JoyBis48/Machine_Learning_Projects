	<TEXT> It's no big secret how to make your own.  Take cubed steak and pound the shit out of it till it looks like it wrestled with a waffle iron and lost.  

Season 2 cups of flour with the seasoning of your choice.  I like "Slap Yo Momma".  In a second container mix 1 1/2 cups buttermilk, 2 Tsp baking powder, 1 Tsp baking soda and 1 egg, garlic and hot sauce.  Coat in flour,  then dredge in the buttermilk mixture and place back into the flour.
  
Very Important...when you coat it the second time make sure you thoroughly pat the flour into the steak until it feels dry.  Place your steaks on a sheet pan lined with parchment paper and dusted with flour.  Refrigerate up to an hour until you're ready to fry em up.  This step is not necessary but I feel it makes a crispier crust and gives you time to clean.  Fry at 325F in 1/2 inch oil about for 6 to 8 minutes on each side.

Use 2 Tbsp of the leftover oil and pan drippings to make a cream gravy.  

You've done it all right if you don't need a knife to cut it or teeth to chew it for that matter!      </TEXT>

Of course, when she became ill she received the best care available. </TEXT>

They filled a 2' pickle barrel with frozen beef patties and set it on the floor next to the grill uncovered, taking them out as the orders came in.  They'd refill it at night without cleaning it out and store it in the refer till the next day.  No telling how long this went on but FIFO definitely wasn't a term they ever heard because when they were shut down the bottom of the pickle barrel was alive with maggots.       </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Your Dracaena Marginata is not happy! Marginata's need water but not a lot and do not let them dry out.   Good news!  It's perfectly normal for a DM to loose its lower leaves as it grows.  If it's a matter of too little watering you will see brown dead leaves scattered all over.  The brown tips you see are usually caused by salt damage.  This can happen a number of ways but it can be prevented by watering the DM enough so that water drains out  the bottom and flushes the salts out.  If you let this plant sit in its own water runoff especially its own "waste" then it will uptake the salt and will burn the ends.  Letting it sit in water for any length of time will also lead to stem and fungal rot.   Make sure all the soil is saturated when water when you do water.  Sometimes a rootball will dry up to the point that water doesn't penetrate and just leaks around it so use your best judgement.  Marginatas need water and don't like to ever dry out but they also cannot stand to be left in standing water.   So it looks like this guy need to be repotted because I'm seeing some roots and the pot is too small for the plant.  Choose a pot that is no more than 2 inches bigger than the original and had drainage.  Don't fertilize.  After transplanting use a weak solution of root starter.  Again, don't freak out if it loses for leaves.  At this point you want to grow roots, not leaves.  BTW,  just cut off the ends of the leaves at an angle.  Good luck! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Although I understand your frustration it's wrong for you to label your fry guy as incompetent if he's actually a dishwasher.  The one who is incompetent is your manager.  Take it up with him if you have a pair.  
Manning a fryer may seem easy to you but depending on the product it can be daunting.  At least he's trying and you should recognize that and possibly help or encourage him instead of calling him a moron.  

Think about that on your next smoke break! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would not say that you're more likely to get pregnant during your period but it IS possible.  The second statement may depend on what type of birth control you use.  The bottom line is that menstruation does not make it impossible to conceive and it certainly doesn't prevent you from getting an STD.     </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Cream of 'insert here' soup was a Capitalistic plot by Campbell's Soup Company to promote their product plus really bad recipe books following WWII which, because of convenience for the average housewife, led to a decrease in cooking skills.  

 This lead to the eventual low standards of the American palate that grew up to believe that condensed tomato soup from a can was normal and Hmm, Hmm good!  

 Eventually no one knew how to make a sauce, roux or soup  without Campbell's condensed soup.  Except for people in New Orleans and surrounding areas.

 They seemed to have been influenced by Communists to resist the Capitalists influence of convenience foods and instead what they had growing in their backyard or local market.  This is well documented by the Warren Report that outlined the Communist presence and their influence on Lee Harvey Oswald but I digress.

 An entire generation was born and raised not knowing how to cook and their only crutch continued to be Campbell's soup and even crappier cookbooks in the 60's complete with jello molds (but that's another story).  Things would change in the 70's though!

 As early as 1931 the first edition of "The Joy of Cooking" was published but was mostly ignored by home cooks.  After it's 6th edition in 1975 its popularity suddenly exploded and sales sky-rocketed.  This seemed to beat all logic but a book published a little earlier explains why.

  In 1972, A book titled "The Joy of Sex" was published that proved enormously popular even though it had illustrations of hairy hippies.  I have to say at this point that that those illustrations were my first visualizations of sex.  I really couldn't actually describe what I thought sex was at that age but the JOS made it perfectly plain and more important that it sex was not scary, but I digress again.  Sorry.

  It's my theory that the "Joy of Cooking" became popular after the "Joy of Sex" was published because if the JOS worked for you then the FOC would too.  Makes perfect sense.  Sex then food!

Please don't get me started about how Spam ruined Hawaiian cuisine!   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's not a ham hock.  Hocks come from the ankles of a pig.  That looks like what was left over from a bone-in spiral ham.  I'm sure it tasted good regardless.  

I myself like to add pickled pork for the texture difference along with andouille plus a touch of thyme.  Unfortunately I can't find picked pork here in Texas.
