If we kept the money in a locked box, there would be plenty to go around.  We have a bulge in the number of people using the program during the boomer years, but this was expected and won't last.

White Americans have not voted for a Democratic President since LBJ who said he was afraid he had lost the Democratic vote for a generation when he signed the Civil Rights Act.  Source: Dog Whistle Politics

Sorry for not finding the exact statistics to back it up, but it's in the book.

	<TEXT> Actually, I think that "Dog Whistle Politics" stated that 96% of Romney's vote came from the white population.  In terms of membership, Yahoo says whites make up 90% of all Republicans.  
http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20080619075211AAEZsTi
"Dog Whistle Politics" did say that Romney won the white vote of every age group which surprised me.  I thought youth had become more liberal.

"Dog Whistle.." also reported that the Democrats have not won the white vote for President since 1964 since LBJ was elected.  You may know that when he signed the Civil Rights Act, he predicted that he may have lost the south for the Dems for a generation.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyndon_B._Johnson

This caused Republicans to develop the Southern Strategy under Nixon. Two Republicans former chairs have apologized for that strategy:

Ken Melman, former chair apologizing for the party using the race card: http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/07/13/AR2005071302342.html

Michael Steel, former GOP chair apologizing for the party's use of the Southern Strategy:
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/04/22/michael-steele-for-decade_n_547702.html

You know, I'm white and don't like to hear this either, but sometimes the truth is painful.  I really recommend this book. C-Span had an interview with the book's author.  You can watch an interview at: http://booktv.org/search.aspx?For=dog%20whistle%20politics

I calling someone a liar is not the best way to disagree.

	<TEXT> He's right.  The Republican Party is 96% white, and the white population is diminishing as a proportion of the population.  Two former Chairs of the Republican Party have apologized for the party using the race card.  The party is fundamentally flawed.  I just finished reading "Dog Whistle Politics" and recommmend it for people who want to understand it.  Rand Paul is not a libertarian either.  He has some issues that he sounds great on, but then there are other issues.... </TEXT>
