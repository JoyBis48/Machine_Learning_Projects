	<TEXT> I don't know if I would call him a fucking scumbag, he regularly played with his viewers when he was on LoL and gave them a few tips. He wasn't great but he wasn't bad either, and never played too seriously, that doesn't make him a bad person, just someone who saw the opportunity at that audience and took it. It isn't always about super tryharding games and learning when watching, there are also a bunch of streams out there that like PL's have more of a comic tone and that's also alright. If people didn't like him they should've closed the stream, not sending the fucking SWAT team to his house. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Es muy posible. No s si harn autopsia (calculo que s), ah seguramente saldr bien qu fue. Ten en cuenta que la causa de muerte puede haber sido originada en cualquier lado, no exclusivamente en el corazn. Por ejemplo, puede haber sido un ACV, un tromboembolismo pulmonar, un cogulo arrojado por un tumor en cualquier rgano, una falla cardaca, etc etc, la lista es largusima. Para detectar cualquiera de estas cosas se necesitaran exmenes bastante especficos, lo ms leve siendo el ejemplo de un tumor que puse que en cualquier TC salen las masas, pero dudo que les hagan tomografas a todos los jugadores como parte de un examen fsico rutinal. 

Lo que s no existe es la "muerte sbita" en el sentido que est todo ok con tu cuerpo y de repente sin motivo te mors. Cuando se habla de muerte sbita se refiere a que sin razn aparente la persona fallece, pero el motivo siempre existe, el tema es encontrarlo. A veces se puede, otras veces no. Las enfermedades que comparten esta caracterstica de origen desconocido se denominan "idiopticas", la muerte sbita se podra bien llamar "muerte idioptica". En una autopsia es mucho ms fcil encontrar la causa porque no tens la limitacin de mantener a la persona viva o saludable, pods tocar lo que quieras sin preocuparte mucho y encontrs bien todo. Esperemos que lo hagan. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Me cans de aclarar esto ya. TODAS las ambulancias tienen desfibrilador, no lo utilizaron porque al desfibrilador no sirve para reanimar corazones detenidos como muestran en las pelculas, sirve para volver el corazn a ritmo en una fibrilacin ventricular, cosa que el pibes no tuvo.

Y aunque haya tenido vfib, te mata en segundos, la nica chance de usar un desfibrilador es tenerlo muy a mano y con un diagnstico seguro de que el sntoma es fibrilacin ventricular (no auricular). Desfibrilar a alguien con un paro cardiaco tiene el mismo efecto que meterle el dedo meique en la oreja. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I wasn't trying to lecture you, Jeez... I just disagreed with how you felt that your struggles were more complainable and your ex-BF didn't have the right to complain about what happened to him. 

EDIT: To expand a bit, you said "I have a hard time relating to people who had it easy. And I hate to say it, but I often find it hard to have sympathy for them when they tell me about their struggles". This is wrong, because to other people YOU are complaining about non important things (think of the example of the kid who couldn't go to school, and you're complaining about going to twelve of them). So, in a way, you also had it "easy". I'm not saying your struggles aren't worth of complain, quite the contrary, I'm saying everyone's elses also are. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I seems that I've offended you. I'm sorry, that wasn't my intention at all, I believe you've misinterpreted my post. It wasn't either an agression, nor a comment about your lack of empathy (which I never said was the case). 

Please try to give it another read. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm sure am :) With the power of therapy and a lot of help and love from my close family, I like to think I managed to transform the whole shit package to something nicer. It's cool to get good things about bad situations. It's hard as fuck, I won't lie to you on that one, but it's good.  

I also believe this will be a edging (is that the word I'm looking for) matter on my life for a long time, maybe for ever. I will continue to try getting good things out of it, and remember the bad memories as something far away from my current reality.  

Thanks for your kind wishes. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, I get your point, but as I somewhat stated above, I think it's all about personal experiences and points of view. I'm sure to your ex-BF changing to 3 schools was really hard, because in his personal experience that was (maybe) one of the worst things or the hardest things he has lived. For you and me, that's not as hard, because we changed schools a lot more, and we view that as "a piece of cake". For us changing 12 schools (I'm on 9 here) was a lot of struggle, but if a uneducated child from a poorer situation hears us, he says "well, what are you complaining about? at least you got to go to school".   

Everyone experiences only one life, one point of view, and their standars for best and worst are as valid as yours or mine. At the same time, a lot of people hears my story or others here and goes "wow, that's super awful", which it is, but honestly it sounds worse if you compare it to their situation, to me it was horrible, but it also felt like what "normal" was. Later on on life I found out that this wasn't the regular thing, let alone the acceptable thing to happen to a kid.  

What I'm trying to say is that empathy is a powerful feeling. Maybe on of the most. There is always going to be someone who has it worse, and someone who has it best. Another quick example before I bore you with all this; you know when you see someone with lots of money and say "wow, if only I can have that... I could be so much happier!". Well, rest assured that someone else has thought the same thing about your situation sometime. Maybe a homeless guy, maybe someone who wishes has your looks, maybe someone who wishes education, I don't know. I believe that gives me some perspective about thinking in other people's shoes. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No problem, I did on another comment though so I'll paste it here.

I had lot of trouble eating because he was yelling drunk all the time and hitting things, so sometimes (most of the times actually) I didn't eat much, he would force me to, I would puke because, you know, I was a fucking kid, and he would made me eat that too. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks, it sure sucked, but then my mother grew strength from what seemed thin air and kicked him out when I was 9. He was a religious fanatic, and he prohibited my mom to work because he said psychologists practice arts from the devil, and that she was possessed by demons. That led to my mom and I having no money when he left (and of course I didn't hear from him for 4 years) buy we were happier than ever.  

My mom then met this amazing guy who she's married to now, and he has been my father in a lot more aspects than the biologic one, so I appreciate that a lot as well and I'm grateful for it :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The law force in my country is absolutely non existent, as the justice system. For example, just yesterday a judge lightened the sentence of a rapist who had abused a 6 year old kid saying that "the kid is gay so there isn't much damage to be done". Seriously. You can look it up, happened yesterday in Argentina.    

Besides, my mother feared the shit out of my father. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's rough, and it sucks, but being in a similar position I can tell you that most of us who get shitty parents find a way to grow stronger and develop more resilience with it. Of course this isn't all cases, sadly. It sounds super harsh and rough because you are seeing it from a perspective of a more happier family, but at least in my case it helped to build a stronger self and more generally responsible of my life. It's amazing the things we can endure when we have to.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My dad put a loaded gun on my mom's mouth and said to her that if she didn't get an abortion, he would kill her. That was before I was born (I'm 23 now), and that's on top of years of hiting both of us, making me eat puke, fucking my aunt, and tons of other monstruous things. Luckily they divorced when I was 10 or so, and I got an amazing step father not so much later on.  

I didn't see it happen, but I know it did because he admitted to it after I confronted him with the truth. He's much different now, and I *kind of* get along, but I will never forgive what he did to my mother on that ocasion.  

Sorry if I have bad grammar, English isn't my first language.  

Edit: for those of you saying she should've reported him to the police, I don't live in a very much civilized country. The law system and enforcement here absolutely sucks. The only thing that happens when a woman reports her husband here is that then police show up if you're lucky, takes a few notes and then leaves, and I'm not even exaggerating, it's how it works. She didn't do it because she feared getting murdered and I totally understand her for it. She was married to a very insane man in a very shitty country, she got lucky to even got a divorce and be alive. </TEXT>
