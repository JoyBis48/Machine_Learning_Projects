	<TEXT> Actually, I'd say critical dissonance is just as common as any other form of media, however, due to the wonders of the internet, people have an incredibly hostile approach to any kind of criticism/lack of perceived criticism. People are gonna hate destructoid for giving gone home 10/10 in the same way they hate destructoid for giving AC 2 a 4/10, or Empire magazine for giving Birdman a 5/5. Accepting other peoples opinions about trivial shit and moving on just isn't very valued in today's society.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Lucy was one of the biggest summer blockbusters of the year, and had a fairly decent critical reception, despite the fact that the film is pretty surreal. Johansson also starred in Captain America 2, another massive hit, and Her, which garnered a lot of acclaim. I also think under the skin had a lot of critical success due to her performance, particularly as it relied on her seducing people in real life. (some of those guys aren't actors) Spielberg also technically CAN'T take his name off, because he owns dreamworks, and he never took his name off transformers. My feeling is that the movie will be good to mediocre, but get decent acclaim from people who haven't seen the anime, and either aim for the 'her' audience or go all in with summer blockbuster mode, in which case it will likely sell gangbusters. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, firstly, I believe their gameplay role is to be stealthed past, by moving from cover to cover, and they also demonstrate the fairly obvious message of 'brothels are bad, these women are forced to work in brothels, this guy kills people for sexual pleasure, your taget is a scumbag etc' as demonstrated by Log1c bombs rebuttal of  Thunderfoots video (although forgive me for going by on memory) that video also shows that the path isn't the ONLY path through that area.

I'd also argue that since it's a stealth game, the whole POINT is not to interact with people, as that requires being seen/discovered, and the player is discouraged from doing anything because it's an unnecessary risk. (you can also go through the whole game murdering EVERYONE with a variety of weapons, and ARE encouraged to kill a lot of people in creative/violent ways) I'd say that's enough ambiguity to say that that part not definitely ,objectively sexist. However, there are parts that do prove Anita's point better than she did, (her lack of detail on a lot of examples can prove annoying. Why is spelunky sexist, why is Watch_dogs portraying a sex auction negatively equivalent to endorsing it?) such as, for example, the hitman sniper challenge, where you literally are rewarded with a striptease through a sniper rifle scope, or the nun fight, where have to think of ways to light assassins dressed in bondage gear on fire to get the best score, which are parts of the game that encourage violence against women, rather than just feature the possibility of violence. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As you die, you actually DO die in that particular world forever, but due to time being convoluted, you're moved to a different one where you didn't. The curse of undead is a kind of cosmic balancing in favor of humanity, and the creator of the undead curse is a God far more powerful than the in-game God's, possibly Velka or a general judeo-christian concept of God. Therefore, the only thing that can possibly happen is the reign of 'Gods' ends in all possible universes/strands of time. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Eh i'd say that Absolution encourages you not to kill the women in That  particular example by having it go against gameplay mechanics (it's a stealth game) and giving those particular NPC's sympathetic dialogue. However, there are OTHER elements of the game that do encourage you to do that, such as the hitman sniper challenge thing in Log1c bombs video and the nun attack, which are less ambiguous example. I do think TB is wrong, and that the whole point gets blown out of proportion, but some better examples could've been made to prove that point. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Actually, I don't think *representation* for women in games isn't really that bad, as a tonne of games just let you make your own character now, with RPG's in particular generally having pretty even representation. (not a full 50/50, but decent enough) You still have some old stalwarts, like the FPS genre, but even they are making concessions to the demographic by having token female characters and character creators for multiplayer. Whether women are represented *well* in games is another matter, and there's a large lack of charismatic leads in games in general, but it's not exactly difficult to find female characters in games. </TEXT>

Postal 2(the popular one) was a much more satirical game, you start every level in a frustrating situation, like waiting in line, and can CHOOSE to start doing stupid, violent shit like using a cat as a silencer or whatever, basically, much like GTA or Just Cause but in a much more constructed level, like say, hitman.

	<TEXT> But that doesn't apply to MGS. The Les Enfentes terribles project is the reason big boss left the patriots, which factionalized it between Para, sigint, and zero and snake and Ocelot, with Eva having shaky allegiances at the time of TPP (and presumably still a Chinese agent) if you don't know that, the drama won't have a much depth. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, the 4k are way better guarded than everything else, remember, to get there you have to get the seal/ get past the forest hunters and hydra, kill sif, get a cursed weapon, get ingward to lower the water, get past the wraiths, find artorias' ring, and THEN you can enter the Abyss, whereas everywhere else basically just lets you/an army stroll in. Only one guy could ever reclaim New Londo, and he has to do it alone. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's difficult to say. New Londo is probably the place most fucked up by the time displacement. (possibly because of proximity to the abyss) Hence why artorias has history there despite dying in Oolacile, darkwraith attack you if your on their side, ingward doesn't care about the wraiths , the summonable ally may have died years ago etc. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's....ok, it's mostly finishing up Peace Walker and setting up TPP. And in my opinion, it has way more emotional impact if you've played MGS3 and Peace Walker. MGS3 and Peace walker are also much better games for the money, even if GZ is still good. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'd say play MGS3 and Peace Walker before reading online, and then the other games are pretty fair to look up. MGS3 in particular really sets up TPP, and it's better to experience characters/twists first hand. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You sort of need to get a bit further into Peace walker for it to really 'click'. Once you start fultoning a lot of guys the game really starts to open up, and all the controls are designed to make you feel like this incredible badass. I'd also recommend playing through MGS3 again, either  with a guide or having read the TV tropes page. There's an incredible amount of neat stuff you've missed. Just the end alone has about 50 unique interactions, and you can do cool stuff like throwing rotten food around the fear, which'll make him eat and poison him. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think part of GG is pent up aggression over the Gone Home getting 10/10's everywhere, and costing a fair amount of money on release, you could also point to things like the Sarkeesian videos and the Polaris game Jam as other things which built up some bad blood. A lot of people didn't like some of these things for issues other than social ones (If a guy says 'Gone home costs too much' or Sarkeesian should have stuck to her video deadlines' he gets lumped with GG) and therefore allowed themselves to be distanced from the people who WERE complaining about those social issues.
