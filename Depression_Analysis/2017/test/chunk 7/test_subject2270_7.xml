	<TEXT> oh, i also am an animal lover, i just don't get dogs.  i dunno, they always just look like they're about to bite me.  some of my friends have pet rats, and some people are creeped out by them but we have parties where the goal is specifically to cuddle rats on the couch the whole night.  they are really super sweet animals. </TEXT>
