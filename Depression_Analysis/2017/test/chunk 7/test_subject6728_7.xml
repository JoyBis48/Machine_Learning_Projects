	<TEXT> So how do we know what's cannon?

Also why would harlequin declare a blood feud with Dunkz even if he had killed dupree by accident which i don't think Ghostwalker did, I highly doubt dunkz would've taken control over denver the way he did. </TEXT>

The PCs are hired to secure the area inside tir na nog's veil rumors and reports of a manastorm on the rise are circulating about for a while.

big events does the awakened community speculate on the matrix,  the manastorm did come about altough unexpectingly on it's way to the veil, despite the PCs best efforts the two anomalies crash and the PCs are shot up into a deep metaplane waking up in a completly destroyed tir na nog with remnants of the city and a gigantic ancient sky scraper with a strange architecture showing signs of "life".

The PCs would climb up the tower and there would encounter all types of surrealistic places in each floor of the Building hoping that they would reach the summing before going insane.

I thought it'd be a nice break from the usual Shadowrunning is to be done and give the players the feeling that magic isn't actually as "predictable" as science like some feel.

give me your opinions and thoughts, please- </TEXT>
