	<TEXT> Is your almond milk one you buy off the shelf and is shelf stable until opened?  I think the date on those are when it can't be sold anymore.  But once you open it, it's only good for a couple weeks?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I made one with strong iced coffee. I cold brew and then if I drink it by its self dilute to taste. For the smoothie I used it undiluted,  with frozen bananas, Greek yogurt and chocolate protein powder. Bit higher calorie, but filling. I had borrowed the protein powder from a friend, next time I'll probably just put a little bit of cocoa powder in it or maybe some peanut butter.

I look up recipes online all the time,  and then I play around with ingredients on my own too. If I have a bunch of random leftover ingredients that might go well together,  I try it.

I've gotten some good ideas for recipes here.  


Edit: I've seen people on this sub use PB2 a lot, haven't tried it yet. But from what I understand it's lower calorie than peanut butter and could be used in smoothies as well. 

Smoothies can get high in calories pretty quickly,  but I don't eat breakfast. I figure I can have one up to 400 calories without messing up my meals and snacks for the rest of the day. And if I know I won't be able to eat I'll make a more filling higher calorie one. If it's supposed to be a slower day,  I'll make a lower cal one so I can eat a lunch as well. 

The sugar amount can also get high very fast. More greens and just a little fruit can help keep it down.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I work in the service industry as well.  It can definitely be hard to find time to eat,  let alone eat something healthy.  I've begun making green smoothies with Chia seeds the night before so I can grab it as I walk out the door. In my experience most places allow you to keep a beverage near. And it can be a lot easier to grab a quick sip than to eat a snack. 

I make mine with spinach, coconut water (one that doesn't have added sugar), banana,  pineapple,  and Chia seeds. Mine tend to be between 200-300 calories depending on what fruits I switch up. They are typically spinach heavy with just enough fruit to sweeten it a bit.  And the Chia seeds help make it more filling. 

I also have been packing sliced vegetables and homemade granola bars or half a sandwich.  If I have a few minutes for a snack,  I eat the veggies. If I'm lucky enough to get a little lunch break, I eat the sandwich.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I count both. I typically plan my dinner first and then work my way backwards. I pick my snacks for the day and my lunch based on what's missing in my dinner. My dinner is typically my biggest meal of the day and tends to be either high in carbs or protein.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A lot of cereals are fortified with iron. I believe rice Krispy has 50% of daily recommendation.  Fortified iron doesn't always get absorbed the best, but if you eat Vitamin C with it, it increases absorbtion. So for breakfast you could eat cereal and OJ. 

My boyfriend's daughter is 7 and picky and doesn't eat meat, and doesn't eat enough non meat sources with iron. She recently went to the doctor and was told her iron was very low.  I looked up recipes to make granola bars high in iron. That's an option, but also a bit high in calories.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I tend to switch up what I eat each day.  :) I eat tuna maybe once a week, or even once every two weeks. I appreciate your concern though.

Tuna was a last second addition to the sandwich,  my boyfriend had eaten about half a small can of it for his lunch and I've been trying to eat some more protein,  so I threw it on my sandwich.  :)  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A couple years ago I would have said no more than 5 years older or younger. Now, I've been dating a man 12 years older than me for almost 2 years. Things are going pretty great and I'd love to spend the rest of my life with him. 


We are in slightly different parts of our lives, but I'm not far behind.  He has his career,  I'm just getting into mine. We both have bachelor degrees. 

 Biggest difference I'd say is he is divorced and has a daughter,  but I know several people my age that have kids and are single/divorced. 

For us, the age gap isn't a deal breaker.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not sure what this is in reference to. Maybe you are being sarcastic.  But dietician is the correct term. Anyone can  call themselves a nutritionist. You have to have schooling, internship,  and pass an exam to call yourself a dietician.  </TEXT>
