	<TEXT>  I find that last part of the title ludicrous and looking at the article they never make the assertion anywhere that it can be successful just because of it's timeslot

Yes well done!  That is why the title says it has  "every chance of success" rather than aserting that the show will be successful for its time slot.


  A show being show at 8pm on a Sunday on BBC TWO does NOT guarantee any popularity for the show.

Yes! You sure speak the truth!

  Making this ridiculous suggestion that Top Gear was popular because of that timeslot is just stupid.

Yes that would be ridiculous.  Hence no nobody said that!   

There was only a suggestion that the timeslot for this series isn't a dead one and is one which might inherit top gears audience. The articles says "Airheads is likely to appeal to the same male audiences as the car show".    Stuff like that actually happens and is something tv schedulers think about.   I think the fact it isn't on a childrens tv time slot like the early robotwars is significant and a good thing.

	<TEXT> As long as its framed as reasonable network management." I dislike the vague and undefined nature of "reasonable". To them, reasonable, in terms of the legality of file-sharing would be zero file-sharing, right?

The FCC is smart enough to know it would be difficult to force ISPs to take action by law in terms of demanding that they willfully damage their own business, so now expect to see pressure steadily applied to the ISPs, so they voluntarily choose to "do the right thing".

We have already witnessed the MPAA abusing any law that helps them shut down piracy and I see these loopholes in net neutrality being heavily abused by the MPAA as soon as they can get started on that.

Sure, Net Neutrality does have its good points, but doesn't feel like its good for our way of doing things. The main problem has always been their continued failure to see downloads and lost sales as two quite different things and so they pursue file-sharing doggedly to ensure that we rush out and buy their products. Frankly, if TV broadcasting was better and not full of shows for dumb people and as many commercial breaks as they can squeeze in - I wouldn't even need to download.

I also dislike their notion that you are not entitled to your privacy, unless you're willing to pay for a service to ensure you get privacy.


Reasonable Network Management needs to be explicitly defined such as the ability to counter a DDoS attack. Throttling unlimited data customers on mobile networks because you want to get more money from them or using man in the middle attacks on BitTorrent traffic have been the result of the vague reasonable network management definition.


But at the end of the day, it is weird to even suggest that the economy revolve around "hollywood".  Since when did that happen.

Basically the article  says that all innovation and technology that could be disruptive (outside of their ownership) can be considered illegal. It took labels TEN years to consider digital files as "legitimate". Independent content is never "legitimate". They always consider streaming services as "illegitimate". Every new technology has this hurdle and it's just been given the go ahead.

And penalties for abuse?  This copyright loophole is an end run that invalidates everything net neutrality was intended to do. It's useless.

There is nothing to increase competition. Nothing to reduce rates. Nothing that will immediately speed things up or increase service. Nothing that an average person can use to fight bad behavior or abuse of DMCA (which is more likely than pirating). Nothing to repair damage when whole domains are blocked erroneously. Now they approve of blocking technology. What did "we" win? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You know Washington is on the wrong track with a regulation when even Brussels has a better idea. Witness the latest net-neutrality proposal from European Union leaders, which is smarter than the 300-page blobfish recently imposed by President Obamas Federal Communications Commission.

In response to demands from the European Parliament for net-neutrality regulations, EU member governments are discussing a Latvian plan that would leave the marketplace scope to set rates for different types of data transmission. While the proposal from the governments would require Internet-service providers to equally treat equivalent types of traffic when providing internet access servicesa big nod to proponents of net neutralityit would also allow providers to enter into agreements with content companies to ensure a specific level of service quality.

This isnt a full-throated commitment to letting market forces work on the European Internet. It would be better if the EU werent imposing any new rules on the telecommunications industry. Nevertheless, the provision opens the door to differential pricing, the bane of the net-neutrality crowd but potentially an important market tool for stimulating future investment.

Its also a major improvement on what the FCC did last month when it applied early-20th-century utility rules to the Internet. The key insight in Europe is that there needs to be some market involvement in pricing. The European proposal also waters down a plan to further limit the roaming charges mobile operators charge customers using services outside their home countries. Roaming already is subject to Brussels-imposed price caps, and the European Parliament and Commission are agitating to ban roaming charges.

Any final regulation will need to survive the European Parliament, where support for activist regulation is stronger. What Europe really needs to boost investment and pro-consumer competition would be a single market for telecommunications services, coupled with more reasonable antitrust enforcement to allow the consolidation Europes telecom market so sorely lacks.

Still, this climb down on net neutrality raises the prospect that the EU could end up with a more pro-investment business climate than the U.S. Not everyone wants to follow Washingtons lead in tightening governments grip on the Internet.

Your TL;DR is misleading because it does not accurately summarise the uncertainty of the article and how it uses a flimsy single source for which there is no evidence and something that the company has already denied. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks that is interesting.  But what about TF own testing?   I'd be interested in what they actually believe.

They are just reporting what people are saying.  
Why are there "sides" in this producing evidence that people cannot replicate for themselves?  There is a lot of hysteria around this now and it wouldn't surprise me if people are being devious or whatever.   

I'd like to see some of the trusted media test it for themselves and not just report on internet rumours.   It isn't that hard to get the installer and see what happens.  Instead they are just making headlines. 

e.g. betanews test if for themseveles and call the rumor "crap".

 "We're building tools and hopefully they're valuable to hardware partners who want to do it. In some cases, we'll take the leadership role in shipping stuff. But we're really just building tools for other people to continue. So you'll see more headsets."  Gabe Newell  

 The HTC Vive is a virtual reality platform that's shooting for the moon. It will likely be expensive, or at least more expensive than its competitors. Even if you're not walking around, you're waving your arms in 3D space with the controllers, and that's going to require a decent-sized area that's clear of obstruction

 This is just the opening salvo for Valve.  Valve likely doesn't care that much who "wins" the virtual reality game, as long as people buy games from Steam.

	<TEXT> Yes.  It is very much just HTC's implementation and device.   There also looks to be a lot of non-steam content on the vive via HTC.  I don't see it as valve hardware but it is their flagship for now.   

Check how steamvr is seen as a platform for different hardware in the same way that steam and android are platforms.   
https://steamdb.info/static/img/blog/53/steamvrplatform.png


I created /r/vive which is focused on the HTC device but fully expect /r/steamvr to have a lot of content that won''t make it to my subreddit.  As things are so early, there is a lot of overlap right now and people are not seeing the difference. </TEXT>

I'm not entirely clear but some people are calling it "reVive" as that is what the logo says with "Vive" being the trademark friendly word. 

So if Vive  is a play on 'revive', we can see the dictionary meanings.

* as in to activate, set in motion, or take up again; renew:
* to restore to life or consciousness:
* to put on or show again.
* to make operative or valid again.
* to bring back into notice, use, or currency:
* to revive a subject of discussion.
* to quicken or renew in the mind; bring back:
* to revive memories.
* to reanimate or cheer 

which might make sense for future marketing campaigns. </TEXT>
