	<TEXT> No, because reddits is not a part of free culture and never was. It's a private company that has the right to run its business however it sees fit. If you don't like it, leave. 

I asked a question so please chill. Offended by a question? Then you are part of the problem.


 Those of us who are capable of respecting and appreciating each other will not miss you one bit.

Why so offended by a simple question? Did the fedora get too tight around the fat that you have to want me to leave? Bitch please.

I hope and pray that this is just the beginning of the cleansing of reddit. Fatpeoplehate was a good start.

No. It was not. you got some really horrible subreddits of dead kids and your chubby ass gets all silly about r/fatpeoplehate? 

There are more that deserve to meet the same fate.
That a threat or a promise?

	<TEXT> Used to enjoy playing Magic The Gathering and Heroclix. What broke me?
