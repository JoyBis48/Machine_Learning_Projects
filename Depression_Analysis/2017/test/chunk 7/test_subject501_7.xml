	<TEXT> This movie was going to complete my life. Cary Fukunaga writing and directing? Perfection. Two films instead of one? Perfection. A darker and more violent tone than the miniseries? Perfection. Staying for true to the book? Perfection. Will Poulter as Pennywise? Perfection. Well guess what? New Line just have to go and fuck everything up! According to sources, they were going to cut the budget, only allow for one film AND where going to aim it at teenagers or a younger audience. In other words, they were going to give it the shitty, generic, jump scare-filled horror remake treatment that horror movies are getting these days. 

This just sucks. I hope New Line can pull their heads in and give Cary the space that he needs. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Prisoners, anything David Fincher especially Zodiac, Nightcrawler, The Chaser, Inherent Vice (If you're looking for a lighter tone, although it has its dark moments), anything Scorsese (but I'm sure you've seen plenty of his) as far as underrated Scorsese films go I recommend Mean Streets and Casino. Also Mystic River is a fantastic crime drama. </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2015-05-16 09:49:16 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I was just thinking, if the director of BIRDMAN thinks Will Poulter is good enough to star in 'The Revenant' alongside big names such as Leo DiCaprio and Tom Hardy, and the director of TRUE DETECTIVE thinks he's good enough to play Pennywise then that must mean that this kid has some serious talent, and we haven't seen any of those films yet.

What are your thoughts?
