	<TEXT> JJ said he doesn't like it when movies do that - and I get that that's basically all that the Star Trek reboots were, but keep in mind that he A) didn't write those, B) had less creative control over those, and C) was never a big Trek fan.

Kasdan and Abrams are both competent writers, and I'm confident they know which direction to take the story in. 

We also have Kathleen Kennedy, who does her job of producer very well. We have an excellent cast, and I'm sure every other aspect of the movie is in very capable hands. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Fuck you Rick Berman!

All jokes aside though, I just think there's this thing in movies today where movies with dark tones generally have darker colors. The Empire Strikes Back is the perfect example of having a dark movie, but still being able to have a vibrant color pallet. This kind of makes TDK look a little dull.

I get that they're good performances, but the character of Bruce Wayne has very little emotional depth. He's a shallow character, and his intentions can be very easily understood. Same goes for Alfred. </TEXT>
