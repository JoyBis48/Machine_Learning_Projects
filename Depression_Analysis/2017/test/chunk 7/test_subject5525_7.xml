	<TEXT> Everbody's different, so I'll just have to talk about my balls. In my experience, its a sudden smack type of contact that causes pain. The sac itself is a durable thing, and I enjoy it being pulled, pinched, and otherwise manipulated. My balls enjoy a good (light) squeezing, and other gentle to gentle-ish fondling. But just a light, sudden, tap causes sharp pain, along with harder squeezes, or smooshing/crushing. (Guys, ever sat on your balls? Damn, that sucks.) Go with it, talk to SO, experiment, have him show you what he likes and doesn't. Have fun. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You are sort of half right. A lot of retailers will package meat with C02 to prevent oxidization in meats...it could be because of faulty packaging that 02 was able to get to your meat, which could maybe be a small cause for alarm from a food safety point of view. You didn't mention whether this was out of the package, where it was bought, what sort of packaging it had, or what you've done to it since bringing it home from the store. But most likely just simple oxidization of some safe to consume meat.

	<TEXT> Oxidation. (From the USDA Site) Oxygen from the air reacts with meat pigments to form a bright red color which is usually seen on the surface of meat purchased in the supermarket. The pigment responsible for the red color in meat is oxymyoglobin, a substance found in all warm-blooded animals. Fresh cut meat is purplish in color. The interior of the meat may be grayish brown due to lack of oxygen; however, if all the meat in the package has turned gray or brown, it may be beginning to spoil. </TEXT>

Comcast will have many places where they are the only provider worth a damn, and if they are not the only provider they may own most of the transmission lines and can charge the other companies so much to use the transmission lines that they have to charge more than Comcast....so people feel forced to use Comcast. It's a mess.

	<TEXT> My wife and I, in our fulfilling quest for sexual gratification, have begun to experiment with a little bdsm/bondage play. I like to take my wife a little out of her comfort zone, and she likes to experience new things.

In previous conversations she has told me that she does not enjoy masturbation/stimulation with vibration. We have not experimented much with vibration because of that.

In our bondage play, I would like to introduce vibration, but it should be pleasurable, not punishment.

So here's my question(s). Is masturbation or stimulation with vibration a learned skill? Or is it more something that works for some of you and not for others? Care to share some stories about your like/dislike of vibration play?

Saying all that, I of course will talk with my wife before anything happens, but I am curious what the community here might advise for me, and for her. (She's on reddit, and subbed here, so I won't be surprised to see her pop a comment in.)

Thanks! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My wife and I had gov't assistance at one point in our lives. I was between jobs, and moving out of the city I lived in. There was one point as I moved up in my career that I just made enough money to disqualify the children from medical assistance. I called to ask, really just being surly, why it was that the 50$ too much that I made would take away hundreds of dollars in benefits, and after much talk of tables and earnings, she did tell me that I could have another child, and at the income level I was at, that would qualify my family for all sorts of benefits.

It wasn't exactly the advice I was looking for; and it painted a very interesting picture of the welfare system at large.

"Captain Phillips" would need some rum based islandish cocktail

"Polar Express" could give you a nice frozen drink, maybe with mint? 

"Cast Away" Yes. Coconuts. Pina Coladas maybe?

"The Green Mile" Anything green. Creme de menthe, apple liquers, midori melon liquer.

"Forest Gump" How about a Gumptini? Chocolate martini with a chocolate garnish?

"A League of Their Own" Baseball = Beer. Serve with peanuts.

"Joe versus the Volcano" Mai Tais! 

And for the truly tasteless, because this is Reddit, the "Philadelphia"...a small shot of some red liquer.

	<TEXT> /u/calibur_ 's post is funny, but also completely true. You need relationship counseling, and sooner rather than later. 

I checked out your overview, and I see that you're subbed in /r/Christianity...have you though of seeking help through that sub...though I imagine that you will get much the same message there...with a fair amount of "Let go and Let God" which will probably be of little help at this point.

Do you have a trusted family member or counselor/pastor/preacher at church? I would suggest that route for you and your family.

Whatever you decide, please do it soon. Your daughter's behavior is most likely normal teenage troubles, but the emotional distance in your relationship and the way that you apparently feel about it worries me.

Reach out to someone if you need help; someone IRL, not just here on Reddit.

	<TEXT> I recently had an issue with my 10yo son...he had been sneaking downstairs at night to play videogames. I got curious what exactly he was doing after catching him a couple times, and saw that he was going online to play flashgames. So we sat and had the "internet talk" (who knew that was going to be a thing?) and told him about how going on line was a public event, not a private event. We talked a little about the dangers of predation, but mostly about how bad programs could get downloaded onto the computer that could harm us. I had no intention of doing so, but apparently I terrified him of using the PC! Trying to manage balancing between being safe, and being connected is our new challenge at home. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm glad it's not just me. I like the editing/translating of articles in the target language aspect of Duolingo, but other than that I struggle to stay interested in the site. Many of the sentences just don't make sense, and it adds another level of disconnect...I have found in real conversations with people in my target language I can make some educated guesses about the content based on what a normal person might say, and the way a normal person would construct sentences, and that becomes part of my learning when I find my assumptions are correct, I can file away another word or phrase I don't know, as opposed to trying to guess why someone would say something so ridiculous as your sentence examples show.

What do you think about Memrise? It's user generated, so the good is with the bad there, but I use that site far more than Duolingo recently. </TEXT>

Sorry, there is no hack. Work with songs you like, and know well, that are easier than your current skill level, and practice them. 

The one piece of actual advice I have is to let mistakes happen, and don't stop. Play each time like someone is listening. It will help you to learn to cover your mistakes, and view the song as one piece, not a collection of a thousand things that all have to be done correctly.

Get off reddit and get back to practicing. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I had recently read about an experiment that a music researcher did at some college. I don't have the link bookmarked anywhere, so excuse me if I paraphrase, but the researcher invited professional voice actors to come in and record simple phrases.

One was a happy phrase, and one was a sad phrase.

The researcher discovered that the voice actors, no matter what nationality, background, or accent, invariably dropped the last one or two syllables of the sad phrase a minor third, while the happy phrase stayed in the major.

The article talks about this a bit at the very end, but perhaps the children rhyming phrases mimic our natural tendency to drop our voice a minor third when delivering sad information, and music has simply developed alongside language to mirror that minor third drop to emulate the negative side of emotional communication. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> MIDI is Musical Instrument Digital Interface. What it does in its simplest form, is it records data from your musical instrument (Drum, keys, guitar, anything MIDI enabled) and stores it digitally. 

The information that it stores is the notation, pitch, duration, force (or velocity) along with a bunch of other parameters like clocktime, cues, panning, and other information.

What makes MIDI so useful, is that the way this information is stored allows you to make adjustments to any or all of this information.

Example: You can record a few notes of your guitar through MIDI. The digital signature of how hard you hit the notes (velocity, or force), how long the note was recorded (duration), and where on the fretboard that note exists (pitch) can be saved as digital data, and then a sound can be applied to that information on a DAW (that allows you to manipulate MIDI information). You can then record farting noises through a microphone, upload it to a MIDI processor, use that to replace the sound of your guitar, and now your guitar is a tuned fart-box. You can also use a MIDI processor that will emulate whatever sounds (farts or not) that you have loaded in real-time, turning any MIDI instrument into a multi-instrument, multi-sound emulator.

You can also manipulate the data in many other ways, fixing sour notes, changing the velocity or duration of the note, applying any number of sounds to the digital information, etc, etc.

	<TEXT> Yeah, no problems there, just keep practicing. 

I roll my index finger forward just a bit when fingering (teehee) barre chords, so that I'm not just pressing down with the meat of my index, but the thinner side of the finger. That's just my preference. 

Keep practicing. Hand strength is key.

Do you have the same problems with other barre forms? Like the G at fret3? 

While you practice, you can use the cheater forms too...

There's XX3211. It's a weak F, doesn't sound as good or as full as the barre, but it can get you through a song until your hand is strong.

There's also X3321X. I cheat that one when my hand gets tired...lol. Sounds a bit fuller than the other guy up there, but still missing that full sound of a barre.

Keep practicing. Work on hand strength. (Seeing a pattern?)

Good luck. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> First: Relax. Focus on the simple things. Find what you're good at and focus on those things.

Second: Discuss this with your wife (most important) and your/her family (assuming they're a loving and supporting bunch) and they will tell you essentially the same thing. Relax. Love her. Be there. Do what you can.

Third: There are other ways to help. If you don't feel comfortable in direct baby care, focus on support care. If the wife's feeding the baby, you're washing and sanitizing bottles/blankets/etc. If the wife's putting the baby to sleep, you're reading the story or singing the song. If your wife's the one changing the nappies, then you're the one cleaning baby's room. Sure she's frustrated, but there are a million other things that you can be doing...even if the only thing you can do is reduce your wife's workload around the house so that she can focus on the baby care issues that you are not comfortable with.

My experience: I participated in baby care, but I never felt comfortable with it. I found ways to be proactive and involved, but honestly, it just sort of felt like work. Now that the kids are older, I get to help with homework, and social problems, and arts and crafts, and so many other things that I *am* good at. They're only babies for a little while, don't get hung up on the little things. 

Short answer: Love her. Love your wife. Love your family. And don't forget the most important thing that new parents forget...you need a little time to yourself, and so does she. Make that happen, too.

Good luck, dad. Don't be nervous. Dads have been doing their dad thing for a long long time. Find where you excel, and rock it.

Now go talk to your wife. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Because the US is hell bent on *convincing* Americans how loyal we are to our returning injured troops. They have no interest in *actually* doing anything, especially if they know they can get the same knee jerk flag waving reaction they want if they just tell us that they love the troops.

If they cared about the troops at all, the VA system would not be the struggling, under-budget, paperbased mess that it is.

If they cared about the troops at all, they would have wanted to find out why the suicide rate increased so rapidly after DS Gates instituted the Stop-Loss Programs, and more importantly, why they didn't decrease after draw down.

If they cared about the troops at all, they wouldn't have cut SNAP benefits, as many of our troops, active and retired, rely on food benefits to feed their families.

Or maybe if they cared about the troops at all, they wouldn't have sent our sons and daughters to fight in wars that did nothing but protect the profits of a select group of corporations.

Our politicians wrap themselves in the American Flag, the put their hands over their hearts, and they say all the right words in all the right places, and for some reason we are willing to believe every second of it, even though there are piles of evidence to the contrary. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Tough question on a Sunday afternoon....

Short answer, yeah, Piracy is stealing.

I think a lot of here find ourselves in the weird grayspace of being both a content creator and a content consumer. The creator in me wants to believe that I can make it rich doing what I love, but I know that the best I can hope for is to make a living, and even that is a long shot. The consumer in me, however, recognizes the disconnect in money paid for music and money given to the artist. I don't pirate (okay maybe casually) but I also don't pay for music either. Most of what I listen to and enjoy is more local and small and they usually are happy just to get the listens, so they put music up for free. Like, /u/tomj1990 , I find myself going to the shows, putting up the dollars at the merch table, and knowing that I'm helping them get down the road to the next show.

You mentioned ethics and responsibility, and I agree, there's a disconnect there in modern users, but the "old way" where the men in suits get far more of the dough than the man on stage isn't something I want to go back to.

The point that I took a really long time to get to, is that maybe teaching ethics and responsibility isn't the entire answer: maybe it's teaching content consumers to seek out ways to pay the original artists, and helping content creators think up new ways to source revenue for their work, without involving the giant corporate structure that drives the price of content so high. (Many of the twentysomethings that I talk to don't recognize that they're stealing from the artist, but actively accept that they are stealing from "those corporate bastards".) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No prob. I love my state, as messed up as it can be.

There's good surf in Miami as well, I'm just not as familiar with the spots. Yes, sharks are a concern, but a minor one. New Smyrna is the sharkbite capital, and most of them come from surfers at the inlet hopping off boards and landing on top of cruising sharks...usually small, though we did have a great white about 40 miles off shore this last weekend!

Water temp today here in NSB is 64F. Cold, but doable. Only warmer as you go south.

Couple other things about FL....don't drink and drive, don't get caught with weed. Public drinking is usually a no, but check where you're at, it's okay some places.

If you're into live music at all, check out some local bars in the St. Pete/Tampa/Ybor City area. Great music all over the place.

So many other things that are cool about FL, glad to hear you're skipping the whole Disney experience. Lots of local roadside types of attractions all over the state.

Most of us are cool, but you will be dealing with several different types of people. People in Orlando are different from Miami folks, and the people that you would meet in Crystal River or up near the Itchnetucknee are backwoods redneck for sure. But as long as you don't talk politics or religion, talk to the locals. Orlando/Miami/St Pete/Tampa/Ybor City all have areas that are just not safe for non-locals. Don't go to sketchy places. And things can get sketchy quick. One city block is art and restauants, and the next is crack houses and hookers. 

Feel free to ask anything specific, now or during your trip. Like I said, I love FL, and would be glad to help. </TEXT>
