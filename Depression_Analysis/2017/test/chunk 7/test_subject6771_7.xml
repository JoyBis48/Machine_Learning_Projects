***It breaks rule 1:*** **Use the correct title formatting.** Titles should be to the point, and all extra information or context should be added in the comments. 

Here is how you should format it - 

Another artist's work - "Title, Artist, Medium, Year" 


Also remember no extraneous information in the title means do not state that it's your first time using a medium in the title, or write 'Hey Reddit', 'What do you think?' 'A ____ I did' or any variation or be subjective in the title ("awesome work," "amazing piece" etc). Also do not mention your 'cake day' or use karma-bait titles.

	<TEXT> Thank you EelisKyttanen for your submission! Unfortunately, your post has been removed for the following reason(s):

***It breaks rule 1:*** **Use the correct title formatting.** Titles should be to the point, and all extra information or context should be added in the comments. 

Here is how you should format it - 

Your artwork - "Title, Medium, Size" 


Also remember no extraneous information in the title means do not state that it's your first time using a medium in the title, or write 'Hey Reddit', 'What do you think?' 'A ____ I did' or any variation or be subjective in the title ("awesome work," "amazing piece" etc). Also do not mention your 'cake day' or use karma-bait titles.

***It breaks rule 6:*** **Do not submit sketches, doodles or unfinished work.**  Post these to other subreddits like /r/IDAP, /r/sketches and /r/doodles instead. If it's an unfinished work and you need advice, then post it as a self post.  



For more information about the subreddit rules make sure to read the sidebar, and if you have any questions please feel free to reply to this comment. Thank you! </TEXT>

'A ____ I did' or any variation or be subjective in the title ("awesome work," "amazing piece" etc). Also do not mention your 'cake day' or use karma-bait titles.

***It breaks rule 8:*** **Do no request tattoos or artwork commissions, or link to pages selling art.** These posts should be submitted to /r/artstore or /r/designjobs instead.

Some words from the artist regarding this piece:

Rusaka is a slavic female demon usually appearing around lakes, ponds or rivers. She deceives men and drowns them. I wanted to show her as a dead corpse that uses a charm, so that she looks like a pretty woman when out of the water.

I've had some voices wondering about the swastikas on the rims of the guys shirt. So to make it clear. I have no connotations with any extreme right wing parties nor do I keep any nazi or racist oriented beliefs. Swastika has been used for hundreds of years in Poland, before Hitler stole it and spoilt it for everyone. The action of the image takes place in 9th or 10th century. If you want to know more about swastikas just wiki it. There is a really broad and interesting article written about it.

	<TEXT> i used all 300 characters. can anyone tell? 

 Torre Abraham Lincoln, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Construction on the two circular 36-story towers remains empty and unfinished since construction was halted in 1974. Conceived as the centrepiece of Lucio Costas modernist plan for the region, the Torre Abraham Lincoln buildings were intended to be the first in a series of 76 individual towers. The plan was eventually abandoned due to poor material choices and the inability to secure enough of the projects land due to private ownership.

	<TEXT> thaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaank you! what a breath of fresh air for my asthmatic lungs. 


i feel like these top mods forgot that these subs are not even our's/their's to begin with and we're all just guest here. Disappointing top mods (who we rely on to be rational individuals) would make such a hasty, irrational response to close their subs. 

the actions of the top mods that closed their subs are *not* the path of a jedi.  </TEXT>
