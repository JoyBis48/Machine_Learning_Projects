	<TEXT> The thing is...as far as the job search goes, it's not your responsibility to see if you're eligible, it's the company's. It doesn't matter what you think of your abilities. If you want the job, apply for it.

Then it's up to them to see if you're a good fit. For example, the entry level developer is a pretty broad position; they might have a particular position in a particular team in mind which requires a more analytic frame of mind which your EE degree would have kindly blessed you with.

So, go forth and be brave. Don't reject yourself. Let them reject you! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I just took that interview last month and got an offer...Will be glad to answer questions...though I can't deal with specifics of the questions since I signed an NDA.

It's an all-day coding project and you work with what seems to be a simplified version of a real-world problem. You can (and should!) ask questions of your teammates and the employees in the room with you. You can ask Google (I mean, the internet..you'll have access to internet) for help if you want... but basically don't hesitate to ask anyone questions.

The problem really tests your basic coding skills -- whether you can drill a problem down to what it requires, design a data structure for the problem and then use it well to solve it. The one-on-one is very relaxed as well and has to do with the problem itself and make sure you ask him all the questions you have about the work and work culture at Amazon at that interview!

It's a lot of fun and much less stressful than the process at other companies...Good luck! 

And ask away if you have questions... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This may be slightly weird... but whatever, I'm counting on anonymity, even though I'm not using a throwaway.

Here are the facts: I'm 29, only been in one relationship. The sex was bad. I was/am quite bad at it too.

The constraints: I am Asian (Indian) and will soon be under extreme pressure to get married. 

So say I have two years left. 

I've been reading seddit for a while now and have gone from complete AFC to slightly AFC. I can now talk to girls, #-close, but nothing further. I have cultural barriers in addition to confidence barriers. In addition, I assume every girl is racist even though I've mostly found that it's me being racist about myself and everyone else is fine...if that makes sense.

So yeah, say I have two years left and I want to get good at seduction+sex, the whole process.

Plus, I'm moving to Seattle from a really small town in four months.

I want to hit the ground running there. What, specifically, should I do before then to ensure that I have the courage to go out and screw up or screw someone whenever I want to?

	<TEXT> I'm a drummer and I'm in college. Get an Electronic Kit (I have the Yamaha Express and it's really good!) and you can play with headphones.

You'll think the electronic kit sounds good at first, then you'll think it sounds like shit when you play on an acoustic kit (esp w.r.t dynamics) after two years and then finally, you'll see you have no choice because of where you live.

As for where to learn, I would strongly recommend taking 2-3 hours of lessons (more if you can afford them) at $20 (or whatever)/hour. It's really worth it and to this day, I regret not taking lessons when I started. It really lays the fundamentals for everything that follows.

If you need any more advice, PM me...This is a subject I love talking about :D </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I just reopened the book at a random page to find something (and then re-reopened at another random location so that I won't give you spoilers):

"Kid's in the shower", he said, motioning a cigar towards the sound of water hissing in another room. The room in which we stood (we were standing because there was nothing to sit on) seemed as though it were just being moved into; you expected to smell wet paint. Suitcases and unpacked crates were the only furniture. The crates served as tables. One supported the mixings of a martini; another a lamp, a Libertyphone, Holly's red cat and a bowl of yellow roses. Bookcases, covering one wall, boasted a half-shelf of literature. I warmed to the room at once, I liked its fly-by-night look.

It's not that he's describing something special. But as a writer, if I think about it, there's absolutely no way I could have gotten such a strong impression across to the reader in so few words. He knows exactly what in the room (the scene the sounds, the objects...everything!) is relevant to get a feel for the place and the time and the people involved.

Amazing stuff to learn from. </TEXT>

If it's a writer you respect, read anyway. Follow the advice. Use your judgement.

For example, this one's advice from Neil Gaiman. I think he knows more than me and I love his stories and trust that he will give practical advice that will still make it seem like you're following your dream and being awesome.

So I read it and when his advice contradicts mine, I trust his. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Ironic that I'm asking on reddit, yes. But this is where I come to for a lot of my questions.

However, I want to try and stay off reddit for a few (at least two) weeks. I've tried the following and couldn't keep up:

1/ Restrict reddit usage only to specific subreddits
2/ Use StayFocusd
3/ Use a time tracker
4/ Pure will power (this never works for me anyway)

Any ideas you guys have will be greatly appreciated.

The reason I'm doing this: I just went through a really bad time the last few months where I lost a lot that really mattered to me. This has made me realize that unless I make some drastic changes to how I live, well....I will continue living how I live, and I'm not happy with it.

To this end, I want to take out everything till I see myself for what I am, and then let things in one by one. I'm not sure that makes sense (or is even relevant to this post), but reddit is one of these things. So, ideas welcome, even if all you say is "Suck it up and try your ideas again"! </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2013-01-17 03:36:30 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm on Week 10 (approximately) of Starting Strength and my Squat is at 215x5x3 (My height 6 ft, my weight 171 lbs).

For the last three sessions, the right side of my groin has been hurting when I get to the heavy weights. Today, I finally asked an experienced bodybuilder what I might be doing wrong. He said that it's on one of these three:

1/ I don't warm up
2/ I don't drink enough water
3/ I don't breathe while squatting.

While I do warm, I found out that he was absolutely right about 2/ and 3/. I don't drink water at all and I practically hold my breath. That's why I get dizzy too, supposedly...Who knew? So that's the PSA!

I need advice on what I should do about the groin pain. I find it doesn't interfere with the weights, though it hurts quite a bit on the last few sets.

Should I reset to a lower weight?

Should I not squat for a few days/weeks?

Are there some specific stretches I can/should do?

Thanks! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, to paraphrase from Oscar Wilde: 

I was working on the proof of one of my poems all the morning, and changed an 'E' to an 'e'. In the afternoon I changed it back.

Really, that's how it happened. I wanted a smooth transition from the shaving gel to the knob to the mental fucking. Somehow, I felt it wasn't smooth till I capitalized the 'E'. Then I thought the capital 'E' was pretentious. Then again, I thought if pretentiousness is what it takes to get my message across, so be it :)

Columbia Street Roastery has a few good blends: The Escobar blend comes to mind. Needless to say, the coffee at Escobar is awesome!

Strange as it may seem, I prefer Caribou Coffee's blend from county market to all of the above! It's available in the coffee aisle by the pound. Best!

If you french press, you should try Aeropress... At least equally good and less mess to clean!

The knob turned slowly in my gentle hands  
Surely Erotic

I turned the lights off   
And for a moment  
Fucked you in my mind  

But I usually forget to turn the lights off  
So before getting out  
I turned them on again </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I put on 35 lbs on either side of the deadlift instead of 25 by mistake. So I was lifting 205 instead of 195.

Man, those 8 reps were painful! My face was contorted like cooked spaghetti... 

But I got through them!! And only when I was reracking the weights did I notice.

Victory by chance...but still a victory! </TEXT>

	<TITLE> SS and Running and diet question </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-01-13 22:06:03 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I used to run long distance, but then stopped. I restarted, got up to 12 miles again, and then stopped again when I began the SS program, because I was told that running would interfere with my SS progress.

8 weeks in, my goals have changed:

I want to continue SS, but am no longer too worried about the numbers, as long as they go up somewhat (I'm still on Linear progression and haven't plateaued), but I would like to start running again and training to run really long distances on trails (50 miles or so).

I like SS, so I was wondering how I should modify it so that I can do running on rest days and still not hurt myself or make myself too weak to perform in the rest of my life!

Are there any diet modifications I should be making?

Details... Height 6 ft: Weight: 171 lbs.

Squats: 95 - 195 lbs   
BP: 70 - 115 lbs  
PC: 45 - 85 lbs  
OHP: 45 - 85 lbs  
Deadlift: 95 - 205 lbs   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh I completely agree with this article.  Well, sort of.

I don't know about it becoming a movement and all, but I like thinking and clicking. Sometimes, I put the camera away and try to experience the sight BEFORE clicking away like a madman.

The experience comes first for me. Always. The experience of getting a good photograph because I thought about it comes next. 

Then I click away like the son of a madman and a tourist, and who knows...one of these random clicks turns out better than the one I thought about for an hour. But it's just not the same.

	<TITLE> Snowboarding photography tips </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hello /r/photography,

I've been thinking and clicking away happily for a few years now and wanted some tips on the quick, bad world of snowboarding photography.

I'm going this weekend and wanted to get the best snaps I can. My camera (an old Nikon D40) is not particularly valuable any more, so I'm okay with it getting a little worse for the wear.

I have an ND filter to allow me to take some interesting things during the day... But any tips and tricks from you guys, some of whom I'm sure have done this before.

I'll be snowboarding AND taking pics of my friends...so no equipment or extra lenses other than the camera kit lenses this time for me! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Quick question: How much do you reset by?

For example, I got stuck at 195 lbs on Squat (did 2x5 + 1x4), so I went back down to 185 the next workout and then managed the 3x5 the the time after that.

Is that reasonable or should I reset by a smaller/bigger amount? </TEXT>

I am not looking for something like Hiromi or Chick Corea, which will keep me bouncing on my seat all through the album, but more like John Coltrane (but on the piano!). 

Music that I can listen to, chill and think. 

EDIT: Man, lots of suggestions here...Thanks a lot, guys! This is going to keep me occupied for months...exploring...relistening :D </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That really scares me. Having conveniences would be good. But the peace that comes with the lack of these conveniences is far more important to me... 

There should be stores, but hopefully they will be far enough so you don't see their lights and hear their sounds, but close enough that you can drive there if you need something... 

But if I *had* to choose, I would choose no convenience close to where I go backpacking. Every time. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Because the right half will fall down, string, hammock and person included. 

The system "Hammock plus person" needs to be held up, not just the person. For this system, him holding up the hammock is an internal force, so it cannot produce acceleration.

You need an external force, i.e. the reaction force of a tree to counter the other external force - gravity in order for the hammock to not fall down.

More generally, you have to be self-reliant, but you have to know that sometimes you need help. </TEXT>
