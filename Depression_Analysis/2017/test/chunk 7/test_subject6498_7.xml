If someone can help me I will be your muppet for a day.
My "white whale" is a muppet show of some sorts that got recorded over my vhs tape of the episode of pokemon where ash meets Snorlax. (The tape is broken because of rewinds)

There was a scene with a muppet that was showering, and he peed in the shower and it was hilarious as a ten year old. I remember me and my cousin competing over who could hold their laughs the longest.

	<TEXT> I loved this growing up. Doktor Mugg is a Swedish television series, named after the program's title character. The series takes place in the fictitious town Dasseborg (Outhouseburg) and revolves around toilet humor, mugg and dass being colloquial terms for toilet in the Swedish language. Other important main characters are Kapten Filling (Captain Skivvies) and Walter Closett.

Doktor Mugg tries to force the citizens to buy his invention "Pruttomobilen" ("The Fartmobile"), a mobile toilet.

**tl;dr**

The show is about a villain trying to make people buy his own product "The Fartmobile". </TEXT>
