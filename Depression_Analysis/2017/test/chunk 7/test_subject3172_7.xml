	<TEXT> This is why crime stats in general are difficult to impossible to compare geographically: Different jurisdictions classify things different ways. I think another example is "drug-related" crime: Some places count a robbery to get drug money as drug-related, others only if drugs are actually directly involved. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I once saw a newspaper story about some guy facing hard times (completely forget the details), and there was a pic of him at his house with peeling paint on a window frame. I realized that I had seen lots of peeling paint in person but never in any form of mass media. It seemed so strange in that context. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In FW there's a stretch of Magnolia street that has a bunch of good restaurants. There's even a vegan place that for my money has the best food in the area, and I'm not vegan. 

If you can find a taco place that makes its own tortillas, go to town. There's nothing like a fresh taco on a tortilla that's only about a minute old. (Soft tacos are the norm; I'm not even sure where you could get a crunchy taco besides Taco Bell.) </TEXT>

A friend of mine moved from Iowa to the Austin area, and on one of her first visits she saw the lane reflectors sticking out of the roads and asked if they interfered with the snowplows. Bit of a cultural change there. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yesterday I met some friends for coffee, and someone had written on the coffeehouse chalkboard, "Word of the day: Sonder." I looked it up and *sonder* is exactly what you said: The fleetingness of our minuscule presence in most others' lives.

So it's kind of cool that you came up with the same concept shortly afterward and then I read it.

Well, see you around, or probably not, actually. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> [Here's a study](http://www.theatlanticcities.com/commute/2013/03/do-texting-bans-really-prevent-fatal-accidents/5104/) that found that bans like Denton's usually do nothing; in some cases they make things worse, because texters just try to hide their phones and take their eyes off the road.

The upshot is that the texting ban has to accompany a ban on all mobile-phone use or it's effectively impossible to enforce ("I wasn't texting, I was dialing!"), and the gains only last a few months without strong enforcement. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It sounds as if you want to say "The experience has made me a much better person" but you don't feel that way. It's OK, it's early in the process. Reading some of the stories in this thread, some of them sound as if the light just came on and they were cool people all of a sudden. I can assure you, it didn't happen that fast. It never does. We all have to *learn* to be good people, over the course of weeks and months and years.

Other folks will say jogging = recreation, running = trying to do well at races. Or (my favorite), fancy multifunction watch = running, otherwise jogging. Really, though, it doesn't matter what anyone calls it. We're all just doing what we can in the moment. </TEXT>
