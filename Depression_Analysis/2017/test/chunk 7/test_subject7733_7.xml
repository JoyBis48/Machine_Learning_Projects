Today, probably Wish You Were Here by Pink Floyd. Just an immaculate album.

Guess we won't get Moltres until Riot finishes that Lava map that has been thrown away for ever. And Zapdos, here's where it gets real. Maybe if Kennen electricutes a prehistoric Anivia and it kills her, making her go into eggnivia, it will hatch as a beautiful Zapdos.
