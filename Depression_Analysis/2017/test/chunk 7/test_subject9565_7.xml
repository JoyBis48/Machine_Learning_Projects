	<TEXT> This would backfire because I don't think people would always see the opening night because spending for example $100 for a movie is a lot of money. As a movie lover, I would just wait till the price lowers down or just watch it online. Indie movies, it would be great for because I think people would start watching Indie movies more.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Life sucks. I know exactly what you are going through. Every single day I think about death and how much easier it will be if I died. But then I realized I'm only 20 years old. My life is shitty, but I can do something about it. I laugh about my life it helps me and I like making others laugh. You are 16 years old, I know you think ending your life will be better but it won't. Your parents may not understand your depression but they will be heart broken to hear that you ended your life. Why don't you go to a support group and meet new friend that you can relate to? Don't give up my friend.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm sorry for the PM that you have been receiving. You are not a bad person. Feelings change thats understandable that you want to leave him because also he is being very controlling. Being with someone who has been charged for domestic violence charge is very dangerous. If I were you, I would protect yourself because you are very vulerable in this situation. He is very dangerous and he wants you to feel guilty by saying he is going to commit suicide. Maybe he has a mental illness that you are not aware of that triggered the violence etc. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't know what to say, I'm struggling the same thing to be honest. How am I supposed to help where I can't help myself. I learned that life does suck but its how you deal with the situation it can make life better. Losing a puppy is like loosing your best friend. I can't tell you what that experience is like because I haven't experienced it yet. Being heart broken sucks, but it will get you closer to finding someone who will feel the same way about you. Sometimes we all think we don't have people who care about themselves, but we are wrong. There is people out there who care about you could be your parents, friends, teacher, neighbours, here on reddit. There is someone there for you. I know the feeling of the thought of dying would just make everything eaiser, and trust me I would but knowing that I'm so young and my family would be heart broken kills me inside. Show the girl that she is missing out by doing things you never thought you would do. We all have our moments when we will weak, but it is up to us to steer back into the right directon. Don't give up kid! You can do it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm on cipralex for about probably two months now. The beginning you'll notice that you may not be as alert as you used to be that was a side effect for me. I felt very tired at the beginning but then your body will adjust. The medication will not work right away it will take 3 weeks. I was very scared during the 3 week time because my sucidial thoughts increased to the point where I was picturing wires wrapped around my neck. But my doctor increase my dosage and I'm fine so far. Stress can increase your behaviours so try to find coping mechanisms to help you out.  </TEXT>

No one likes to get dumped especially if he thinks the relationship is going so well that he wants to propose. What would you rather dump him before between you and him or in front of his family while you reject his proposal. If you say yes because you feel gulity thats even worse giving him false hope. Just be honest with him and make time to do it. There is always time you just have to make it  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have a question because you are an intern and he's a worker isn't that against the code of ethics or something that you are not supposed to be in intimate relationships with staff members. Just be careful because you might of put your intern in jeopardy because you deleted the texts but it doesn't mean he did.  Also from the look of this it seem like he pressured you and made you do things that you said many times no. That is not right, he took your rights away.  Saying sorry during the sexual act or after doesn't make it better. If I were you I would stay away from him.  </TEXT>
