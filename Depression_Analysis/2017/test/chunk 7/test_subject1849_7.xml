	<TEXT> No it won't. Free-Trade lifts all boats. Consumers can buy stuff at a cheaper price. Without Trade, your goods will cost a lot more and you will have less choices to choose from. That is why the agreement is secret, so we have to get the best trade offer out there, which lifts all boats overall. There are no losers and trade deficits don't matter because..... you just imported more goods than you export, which means consumers are having a lot of choices. 

Back in the 1920s, when manufacturing jobs were present, how come nobody wanted blacksmithing jobs back?
Why make stuff for our own usage when we can just get items from other places for cheap? We need to depend on other growing economies for our growth. :)

	<TEXT> "i think the congestion of highways has far more to do with an increased supply of motor vehicles as opposed to increased supply of highways" 

Cars are unusable, if nobody rides them. If the overall economy gains more cars, not everybody is using all the cars. Transportation is the act of people going from place to place. Once highways are more open, congestion and time travel would be less, which in turn decreases usage of commuter rail + public transit, which moves those people onto the highways. That is induced demand. There is no point in public transit because the lifestyle is already revolved around cars. Yes, if you live in an area with population not growing and build bigger highways, yes there will be less congestion.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Infrastructure spending is necessary in any urban area. without it, you will have heavy sprawl with 8 lane highways one way in some highways in Georgia. Plus, you still have traffic+congestion from induced demand, so you would need to build even more lanes and roads.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Building more Highways causes induced demand, which will keep them congested, if population continues to grow. Also, highways and roads take up more space than train tracks.
