	<TITLE> [Event] Liechtenstein asks EMU to intervene in conflict </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-07-12 18:10:03 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Liechtenstein is asking the EMU for help/intervention since this declaration of war by Poland, another EMU member, is unjust. Tuva ceded Kaliningrad to Liechtenstein fairly. If Poland had indeed been in negotiations with both the former NSF and Tuva (which Liechtenstein was unaware of) they obviously saw the nation as unfit to lead the territory and chose not to cede it to them or else they would already have it. Liechtenstein tried to make agreements with Poland upon hearing about their interest in Kaliningrad and they took the first deal. I request that Poland be removed from the EMU and other member nations help Liechtenstein in this conflict.

Edit: in fact, I just checked the unclaimed countries list and Sealand is on it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As leader of Liechtenstein, I am taking this moment to formally announce the conclusion of negotiations for the joining together of our two regions! Kaliningrad will remain the name of the Capitol, but the exclave itself will be Knigsberg. In recent years, the economy and population of Knigsberg have been falling, but Liechtenstein is hoping to boost its economy by making it Liechtenstein's center for overseas trade. On top of that, we will also be taking advantage of its amber deposits, fishing, boat, and auto industry, and tourism to boost the economy as well.

Liechtenstein has also made a deal with Poland to insure safe passage of goods to and from our ports in exchange for a percentage of goods that enter and leave the area. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Liechtenstein would like to negotiate the annexation of Kaliningrad Oblast since it is an exclave and not connected to the main land of Russia.

Its name will most likely become the previous name of its capital, Knigsberg while the capital will remain Kaliningrad. 

Its population sits at just over 940,000 at the moment and its GDP is about US$14,000 per capita. Unfortunately, both have been falling. Liechtenstein hopes to reverse this buy boosting investors and helping with overall quality of life.

The population is currently 86% Russian with the rest being made up of various Eastern European demographics. 

We hope to make use of its ice-less ports and make it Liechtenstein's center for sea trade. We also hope to utilize its tourism, amber deposits, fishing industry, and boat and auto manufacturing to continue to boost its own economy and help our own. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The aircraft will take off and land vertically, but the rotors will be able to turn to allow the aircraft to maneuver and move quickly.  When the rotors have been turned a full 90 degrees the aircraft is predicted to be able to reach speeds of over 100 knots, however, the horizontal speed isn't the main goal. The main goal is to have a veihicle that can hover and provide air support and recon in combat zones and be able to arrive and leave the combat zone quickly along with being stealthier than current VTOLs (Sort of a get in, get out type vehicle). The aircraft will be piloted by two men and be armed with a 20 mm Gatling gun at the nose and hold eight MIRV-style rockets for anti-armor and building attacks. More information will be released as research continues. So far the research is expected to take between eighteen months and two years. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Liechtenstein and France are proud to announce the completion of their newest advancement in military technology! After some setbacks, the fully customizable Titan Infantry Armor is being mass produced and used by France and Liechtenstein and is for sale for approximately US$5,000 per suit.

Quick description: The armor is made of a weave of spectra fiber and Kevlar, is made up of paintable panels on a suit that can be added or removed for added mobility/protection, and the armor is fully customizable to the wearer's ability. The second part of the armor is the helmet. It is made of the same materials, covers the entire head, features an HUD that displays location, weapon, and other information, an eye piece with zooming, night vision, and other abilities, and can be fitted with a gas mask and oxygen supply.

Once again, each suit is also available for export to any country under any specification and will arrive combat-ready for US$5,000 or more depending on specs.

	<TEXT> Over 6 years ago, due to threats to the nation and the world, Hchste Kaiser closed the country's borders and only allowed those on important business to enter, and even then, only after extensive security precautions were taken. Today, though, the great leader of Liechtenstein reopened the borders for public travel and immigration! Hchste Kaiser was asked what made him finally decide to reopen and was quoted saying, "I forgot to open them after a few months..." 

Well, today anyone with a passport may now enter Liechtenstein for whatever reason they please, be it the scenery, our famous jam covered women, or simply to worship our wonderful leader!

	<TITLE> [Event] Liechtenstein's bunker is finally finished! </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-05-28 19:39:28 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Liechtenstein's 6+ year effort, the former subway station turned bunker is finally complete! This bunker is, for now, to be used for research and storage of government rations, weapons, vehicles, etc., but its true purpose is in fact a shelter in the event of a nuclear holocaust/meteor strike/other threat to all life on earth. Due to Liechtenstein's small population, the bunker is equipped to sustain a good portion of Liechtenstein's citizens for years. 

Guarded by a large blast-proof gate, it is equipped with living quarters, water purifiers, air filters, environment suits, research and medical facilities, a command center, and more. Despite Liechtenstein's readiness, we truly hope that this bunker's true purpose is never actually needed. The bunker is also equipped with office space and storage facilities for Mann Co. Liechtenstein will always be willing to expand the bunker to make space for any country that is willing to pay and aide in the development. 

The bunker is also home to a large meeting room and living quarters to allow for lengthy meetings between multiple world leaders to discuss business in a much safer and more private setting. </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2014-05-26 21:46:43 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Liechtenstein and France have begun planning a new type of lightweight armor for military personnel. The armor will be made of a light plating sections attached to a suit. The material being used is a weave of spectra fiber and Kevlar. The plates will be separated along the suit to allow for easy mobility, but it'll be possible to add plates for situations where less mobility and more armor are necessary.  If this is successful, the armor ahould be able to resist a moderate amount of small arms fire and withstand anything less. The plates will also be camouflaged to allow for tactical use in any environment. The armor itself will be able to be upgraded and customized as the wearer sees fit.

Along with the suit, we will also be developing a helmet made of the same materials that covers the entire head and face of the soldier. These helmets will be fitted with a radio, a heads up display displaying information on the location (elevation, coordinates, temperature, etc.), an eye piece that allows for night vision, thermal, telescopic, etc., and in some cases, the helmets will be fitted with an oxygen supply. More information will be released if more research is deemed necessary.

This research is expected to take, if all goes according to plan, around 18 months.

As usual, this technology will be available for export upon completion and beginning of mass production.

Edit: some more stuff </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Liechtenstein is looking for a more permanent partner (or partners) to continue helping with military equipment research. This would also open a permanent free trade agreement between Liechtenstein and the country in question and Liechtenstein promises to help that country in its own endeavors. The first project will most likely be Light Personell Armor. </TEXT>
