	<TEXT> Obama didn't de-escalate anything in Iraq. He left on the timeline Bush negotiated after trying to renegotiate to keep US troops there longer.

Bush signed the SOFA Accord but the war *was still going on* and Obama was the one who presided over the actual complete withdrawal of US combat troops from Iraq. It's one thing to sign such an agreement at the end of your final term and another to actually follow through on it. The SOFA Accord was signed 5.5 years after the invasion of Iraq. Lets not pretend that Bush ended anything. He introduced the framework for his successor, but his successor still had to end the hostilities. Would McCain have backtracked on SOFA had he been elected? If you believe yes (which his words leading up to the election would indicate), then how could you not agree that Obama was the one who actually ended the war? We invaded without UN approval, what makes you think a flimsy withdrawal agreement couldn't have been superseded?

He increased the troop numbers in Afghanistan for years with no benefit, or clear mission, before finally pulling back troops.

The idea was the same coin as the successful 'troop surge' in Iraq during Bush's presidency. Just like in Iraq, it worked until the surge subsided. The problem with both conflicts was that there was *never* a clear desired outcome, we wandered in without a goal and with outdated strategy and the people of Iraq and Afghanistan paid the price.

He completely botched Libya

How so? The goal was to support dissidents of Qaddafi in a bid to oust him from power, which was accomplished with intelligence sharing and the targeted strikes of Libyan military assets. Unless you mean botched as in he botched it by getting involved in the first place; an assertion which time will paint a more detailed picture of and you could very well be right on.

and funneled weapons to Syrian rebels, many of whom were Islamist terrorists.

I'm not going to argue with you on that one. I really don't know where I stand on the whole Syrian Civil War or our involvement.

He tried to get involved in Syria very early on and only backed down when there was a large public backlash. You don't remember the whole redline comment?

See, the fact that he backed down when there was a large public backlash is an important point to me.

Obama doesn't get credit just because he didn't get involved in every little skirmish.

When your country has been at the forefront of foreign military intervention since the 1950s, I think you should get a little credit when your foreign policy shifts slightly from that precedent.

Bush had international support when he started his wars, too, as well as congressional ***and UN approval***.

Not in Iraq. International support was paltry at best and UN approval was non-existent.

If anything, he's doubled down on all of the previous administration's follies.

I just can't agree with that when one of those admins started two separate trillion plus dollar ground wars and the other didn't. 

I'm just saying Obama is not anything like the peacenik you're trying to paint him as.

I'm not painting him like a peacenik, I just disagree that he is a war-hawk.

His foreign policy isn't perfect. Far from it, it's lukewarm at best. I don't agree with a great deal of his foreign policy but I do think it's a step in the right direction away from his predecessor (because tepid isn't great but it's better than scalding water for washing your hands).

You should take off your blinders and see what he's really been up to.

You should save the personal attacks for personal arguments.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 100% false. Bush ended the Iraq war, Obama wanted to stay.

If Bush ended the Iraq war, how could his successor want to say?

The Iraq War didn't end until December of 2011, Obama was elected in 2008 and took office in January 2009.

Nice rebuttal, you're off to a good start. 

Um...Do what? Limited by what standards? No occupation?

Uh, yeah. Limited as in limited. Limited as in minimizing war resource allocations.

We always try and claim international support. We did the same thing in Iraq.

Well we *did* initially have a lot of international support in Afghanistan and Iraq to a lesser extent but then we stayed there for a decade, and rightfully lost it.

You seem to think unless we are invading and occupying everything is ok.

I absolutely do not think that, and for you to jump to *that* conclusion based off my comment tells me more about you than you not knowing which president ended the War in Iraq (and confidently not knowing it to boot).

The only thing he hasn't done is a full scale invasion....everything else is 100% Bush policy.

Right...the only thing he hasn't done is get the US stuck in 2 separate trillion+ dollar wars which significantly hurt our international standing and isolated us from our allies.

But I mean really, Obama's foreign policy diverges enormously from GWB's, for better or for worse.

	<TEXT> Care to elaborate? De-escalated/ended war in Iraq from US presence standpoint; de-escalating Afghanistan from US presence standpoint; limited involvement in Libya (air strikes + intelligence); limited/no involvement in Egypt; limited/no involvement in Iraq/Palistine; refusal to join the fight in Syria for 4 years; no action in Ukraine; delayed action against ISIS until now (according to the West chatterbox). And you look at the conflicts we've been involved in (that weren't inhereted) and they share the common bond of international support. 

If anything he's been trying very hard not to repeat what he saw as the previous administration's biggest folley.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I know... The whole point was that Central Park is super busy so people throwing organic refuse in it would not be the same as throwing it in the woods with little foot traffic and lots of space.

Central Park - Lots of Space, lots of foot traffic = not good to throw organic refuse (see: lots of traffic)

'a park' - minimal space, low traffic = not good to throw organic refuse (see: minimal space)

'the woods - lots of space, minimal traffic = fine to throw organic refuse. (see: lots of space, minimal traffic)

Hope that makes sense. I'm sure we're on the same page, just not connecting for whatever reason. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh man, not your feed! Everyone, this guy's feed is wasted with people overly excited about their sex lives. We must correct this immediately; from now on, no sex posts. Hope that helps, yanks209.

If it really bothers you just filter out the words you see a lot that you don't like to see, like 'sex', 'blowjob' and 'fingerblasted'.

edit: see, if you guys just downvoted and ignored the sex posts like you did my comment, you might end up with content you want. hope my sacrifice was productive. </TEXT>
