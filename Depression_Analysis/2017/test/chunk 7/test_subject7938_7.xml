	<TEXT> I think it's very funny when people do find it important. There's actually a 13th now, Ophiuchus, because the stars have moved since the Babylonians. Astrologists would know this if they ever looked up. Seriously, if you think the stars contain your fate, look the fuck up once in a while!

Tl;dr: Caring about sign = totally undateable. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not pollen. You have some trichomes (pronounced "try-combs"), or, "plant hairs". They are widely varying in shape, size, and function. Pollen will only grow one tube and doesn't branch. Google "EM of trichomes" to see how narly they can be and avoid some of the weed photos. (In the case of cannabis, the trichomes are glandular and produce the psychoactive oil.) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Neat photos. Those do look like roots. It almost looks like *Agrobacterium rhizogenes*. That's a bacterium that infects plants and injects DNA into cells. In this case, the cells go a bit rouge and make a bunch of roots. The disease is called "crazy root". No real treatment. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sure thing. I have it up for sale right now on Shapeways:

https://www.shapeways.com/designer/footthong

They can handle volume way better than I can, print in higher resolution, and have the option for metals. I'm still working on getting photos up, but they will make it the same or better than the photo I posted.

I'll put a redesigned version up tonight on the store page. Give it a few hours.
