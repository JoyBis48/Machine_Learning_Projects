	<TEXT> We banned the Klan from wearing mask in public back in the sixties and the Georgia Supreme Court upheld it about twenty five years ago. As far as I know it's never been taken to the U.S. Supreme Court, so apparently, you can't ban free speech, but you can ban anonymous free speech. If not, I guess we have to give the Klan back their hoods. Doesn't matter what the message is, you either do or don't have a right to anonymous free speech.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Selling products worldwide, made through offshore sources can bring record profits

If that is true, how would increasing their profits even more, bring back U.S. jobs? Wouldn't they just logically invest even more of their capital in outsourcing? Also, you still haven't addressed the false narrative in your headline that "U.S. companies are already at a competitive disadvantage", yet somehow are still making record profits. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Good. I like this. It makes me happy. People who refuse to buy health insurance screw over the rest of us when they run up huge medical bills they can't pay by causing the hospitals to charge the rest of us higher prices to make up the difference which leaves insurers no choice but to raise our rates. I'll be glad to see them voluntarily paying higher taxes that they could have avoided by simply buying something that they needed to buy in the first place. They're no better than people who build their house in a floodplain and expect FEMA to bail them out every ten years.      </TEXT>
