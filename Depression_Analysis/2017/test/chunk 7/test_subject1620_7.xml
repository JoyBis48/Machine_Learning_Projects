	<TEXT> Some info about me: 22 year old American male college student. I will be on a weeklong trip to Cancun, MX for spring break during the middle of March. I am looking for somewhere interesting to go after my trip in Cancun, preferably in Central or South America, or the Caribbean, for about 5-7 days. I am not necessarily looking for any type of party scene since I am just leaving Cancun.

Things I would enjoy: sand sports (sand boarding, dune buggies, etc.), hiking/backpacking, surfing and other water sports.

I am a pretty experienced traveller, I've taken multiple solo cross-country road trips and spent 3 months backpacking in Europe this past summer. I would like to keep things as affordable as possible.

Thanks folks! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That sounds brutal. It can be hard to start exercising if you have a migraine but I always figured the more oxygen you get to your brain the better </TEXT>
