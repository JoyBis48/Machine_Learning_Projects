	<TEXT> The paper process is quite involved and there are a few ways of going about it. You can stake a claim on lands that the BLM have allowed for mineral harvesting. But you would need to check with the  LR2000 to make sure it's not already claimed and that is a whole process in itself! Talk to your county's mineralogist  and possibly visit the BLM offices, they will help you as much as they can..at least they did for us here in CA... 

You can also buy claims from people who are selling then but they tend to be a little more expensive but at least that way you are paying for the paperwork being done and just a transfer in title is all that is needed at that point and then putting up the proper signs on your claim.. </TEXT>
