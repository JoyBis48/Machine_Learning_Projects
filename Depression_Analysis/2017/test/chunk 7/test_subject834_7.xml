	<TEXT> I can also completely relate to the 0 sex drive. My sex drive went from pretty normal to pretty much -100 out of 100. I still don't know for sure if it's medications that causes it, because I mean, I've been off meds for around the same time as you (by myself, docs never, ever take me off meds). Schizophrenia can cause you to have apathy I guess but I'm really hesitant to go back on meds because they make that part worse. Also, having suicidal thoughts because of lack of a sex drive isn't good, you should see a psychologist (they can help better with that on a psychological level than a psychiatrist can, a psychiatrist are just licensed drug dealers imo)... When I don't have a sex drive I just think of it like, well, at least I don't have that burden anymore, even though it's a bad thing, if you understand? I'm pretty sure lack of a sex drive is because when your emotions are extreme lowered (apathy) you can't really connect with anyone else, could also be due to anhedonia which accompanies apathy nearly all the time. 

I hope you eventually start to get better.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm pretty sure etizolam is good for anxiety (although it is an RC "benzo", it's not exactly a benzo but it's extremely, extremely close).

Anyway, OP, I'm not all that knowledgable about etizolam but I heard that it's pretty good for anxiety, but I've also heard that it's kinda weird and can be heavily sedating and cause black outs with small doses to it's kinda hard to dose with it for anxiety... I think everyone's different with this particular drug (kinda like every other drug, I know, but this one seems to react differently with everyone).

Sedation - In terms of energy level alterations, Etizolam is extremely sedating and often results in an overwhelmingly lethargic state - Got this from [here.](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Etizolam).
So yeah as enigmaticdoge said, either stick with it until you build a tolerance or try a different benzo.

Edit: deleted because I accidentaly replied to enigmaticdoge. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I made a post not too long ago about how I was dealing with a shit ton of emotions but I just couldn't really express them even though I wanted to, so now I'm back and well, I don't feel anything. I should probably see my psych but I think she's still away sick. It's kinda like some part in my brain where emotions are kept was just swept clean, like there's nothing really there anymore. I mean, I still have feelings but they're extremely died down, for example; on a scale from 1 - 100 my emotions right now are about 6-12 (at the highest) and half of those at the lowest (3-6). I haven't been on medication for about 2 months now I think, dunno if it's that but if it is then, whatever, meds make this 10x worse.

It feels like I might be posting here like a diary, maybe no one noticed because my post are far and few between but whatever, have a nice day everyone.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Doing drugs as a hobby is the worst thing you could do, seriously, take it from me... For me for example, if I don't get any morphine I will seriously just go out and try and do random shit that would get me into a lot of trouble just because I was insanely bored (even if I was in WD's). If I couldn't get some morphine for even just one day, I would go out with friends and not come home for days and when I was out of that bender my friends would be magically gone, they went home days ago. Basically what I'm trying to say is that having drugs as a HOBBY is seriously self destructive because once you don't have that drug you will do anything to alleviate the boredom eventually. Not only that but doing drugs like MDMA that much will damage your brain, and don't even get me started on heroin, that's just not a road you want to take.

Being clean is a good thing you know... Yeah, yeah, I know being sober is really fucking boring but eventually you will have a hobby and build a routine out of that hobby and you'll eventually start to like life again. It takes time, maybe try a program like 12 steps (just keep in mind that it doesn't work for everyone), and/or maybe therapy. But yeah, even if sobriety is boring as shit, it's better than being self destructive and building your fun around drugs, because they don't last forever. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Opiates won't exactly "kill your appetite" unless you use it chronically. The only reason it reduces appetite is because it slows down gastro-motility (and cause gastroparesis in some cases) and they also reduce physical hunger in the same way that they reduce pain. But I can say from experience that opiates won't kill your appetite like stimulants do, they might reduce it a bit but you will still feel hungry but just a little less frequently, and using drugs like this to lose weight is not only unhealthy but unsustainable.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I have a pretty chronic, annoying and sometimes painful gastrointestinal disease (or just stomach, we don't know yet) that's not been fully diagnosed yet. It leaves me with low appetite, constantly shitting, (chronic) nausea, and feeling bloated after small amounts of food for hours. I feel tired, miserable and helpless but then you get these people that think they know how to cure it, even though doctors don't even know what the fuck it is (yet), or they tell me WHY I have it and somehow I end up with all the blame like I wanted this or something. Yes, because I totally wanted to become chronically ill. It's also super, super immoral to tell someone that they caused their disease, or that they can cure it with just 29.99 A MONTH, just fuck off you morons... If I could cure my disease on some stupid diet then I would do it but I have more sense than to hand over my fucking money to some low lifes that just want to make a few bucks on someone elses misfortune.

	<DATE> 2015-03-31 16:19:37 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So, I don't think I've actually made a dedicated post on here, I usually just leave comments but I've been thinking about something lately and thats self-esteem, confidence etc. whatever you want to call it. 

To start off, I'm an opiate addict (morphine and a few others) and I started off like most opiate addicts, pain. Anyway, other than opiates I do take stimulants when I'm out with people to basically give me a sense of self confidence and obviously self-esteem, although it's chemically induced, opiates also give me this alien feeling of "confidence" that I've sadly never had in my life. I've tried therapy and gave up because it never did anything for me, I mean, talking about stuff obviously helps but I can do that to anyone without having to set up an appointment or pay money but the actual therapy itself does nothing. Drugs on the other hand, although it's considered "false", does help, they do give me self-esteem and confidence. I don't just have a low self-esteem, I have what you considered a shattered self esteem, when I'm sober I don't feel worthy of anyone elses care... I would rather do therapy if it worked, but sadly it doesn't, the only thing that works are opiates and stimulants.

So to my question, is it possible for someone to never have self confidence sober? As in, is it possible for therapy to never work and for people to have to have a chemically induced confidence and esteem?

If this sounds like rambling, I'm sorry.

	<TEXT> I'm pretty sure the 'thebaine' is pretty stimulating, hence why oxycodone is more stimulating than the morphine derived drugs, like heroin. So if vaping it reduces the morphine then you will feel more of the 'thebaine', I'm guessing.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The reason I don't want to go back on meds is because they make me feel even lower, I have a history of depression as well and I think I'm having some sort of episode of it, which in return might be producing psychotic effects. I don't wanna go back on meds when I'm depressed, mainly because I don't think it'll help the way I'm feeling. I don't even have any antidepressants and my psychiatrist is off sick. This may seem sad and stupid but this "depression" may have been triggered by a girl I still love(?), I broke up with her a few months ago and we've recently started to kinda see each other on the side again (and she's said she still "loves" me), the thing is, I don't want to see her just on the side. I can't express what I feel, so I just bottle it all up, when I try to say how I feel I just come out with a bunch of words that don't make sense and stutter and stumble all over the place. I don't know why I'm telling this to someone over the internet, but I don't really have anyone else.

The trigger for my "depression" (which in return has triggered some symptoms of schizophrenia) may seem stupid, but I feel like killing myself but I don't know how to tell anyone.

Sorry for a late reply. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So, I've been off my medication for a month or so now and some shit happened that really got to me, needless to say I can feel pretty depressed (even though I can't feel anything, I just know I feel like complete shit), I can't think, like all my thoughts are fuzzy, I don't know. I just can't think. I feel like I might be relapsing, and even going back into a depressive state but I don't know how to tell anyone at all, I feel stuck, like my thoughts are screaming for help but I can't do anything. 

Thank you, just needed to get that out there (even if it seemed like nothing and even if it made no sense).  </TEXT>
