	<TEXT> Once again, Republicans take joy in finding yet another way to punish and humiliate the poor.  I'm not much for religion, but I like to imagine the moment when these GOP Christians present themselves for admission in heaven. Jesus will open his Bible, rub their noses in Matthew 25, and send them on their downward way.

	<TEXT> There are a number of ideas floating around, including a couple in the article.  But the issue is that Walker promised his economic policies would create 250,000 jobs in four years and it hasn't happened.  Instead of admitting that the projection might have been off the mark or that no Governor has enough control over an economy to make such a promise, (or even, heaven forbid, admit  that his policies might not give the results he expected) he's always blaming the protesters or the media or Obama or just about anyone else. Accept any responsibility for the lackluster economy in Wisconsin?  That's not the Scott Walker way. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Lucian Leape, an adjunct professor of health policy at Harvard Universitys T.H. Chan School of Public Health, told PolitiFact, "I think these data are reliable, and the ACA (Affordable Care Act) deserves credit." Leape, who has been studying preventable hospital deaths since the early 1990s, credited improved data collection and the work of Partnership for Patients, "which has been a serious  and successful  effort to engage hospitals in achieving specific goals, such as reducing infections." **He said its the kind of effort he and others called for a decade and a half ago but "never got before the ACA. Hospitals were improving their safety slowly on their own, and this gave it a big boost.**

But what does he know about correlation and causality? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In other words, hospital deaths in general were already on a downward slope prior to the health care laws passage; its just accelerated since then. The authors of the report that Obama cited also hedged a bit on the causes for the decline, writing that "the precise causes of the decline in patient harm are not fully understood."

Seems to me they addressed that. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would say that "low cost methods of manufacturing fossil fuels from plant/animal waste" is a form of renewable energy.  Replacing coal (which is the real problem) will probably be a multi-pronged solution, a better grid, using natural gas in combination with solar and wind, or maybe a solution we can hardly imagine or think possible.  I don't think the Wright Brothers thought their invention and those barely functional automobiles would replace the train as the main methods of transportation in America within a few generations. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not long ago cellphones were unaffordable for most people, and a computer was something at a university or business that you waited for a turn to use. The communications and computer power we all have now were almost unimaginable just a few decades ago, and at a far lower price that very few anticipated.  I would argue we could effect the same change in energy.  A couple of decades of research and spending could change energy production and distribution completely, the same way communications and computing power have changed. Sticking with the fossil fuels is looking backward, like insisting that an IBM 360 mainframe and a AT T landline will serve all our future needs.  </TEXT>

Between [1979-2007 period, after-tax income of households in the top 1 percent of earners grew by 275%, compared to 65% for the next 19 percent, just under 40% for the next 60 percent, 18% for the bottom fifth of households.] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_inequality_in_the_United_States#Post-1970_increase)

Obama is desperate for a deal with this radical-Islamic, terrorist-sponsoring, IED-detonating regime. And he wants Republicans to shut up about it. If Obama finds this Republican medicine bitter, he should stop pouring his own acrid elixir down their throats.

	<TEXT> Yes, it is a bit hyperbolic, and I believe I first read the remark about studies about health, which are particularly polluted with sponsored 'studies'.  But it is also true that industry looks for scientists who are already inclined toward the viewpoint they want. (I'm not saying the scientists themselves are dishonest. I assume they legitimately believe their arguements.) You notice these industries didn't pick a random professor of atmospheric science to study the problem, they funded the one who was likely to say what they wanted to hear. Sponsoring studies with an outcome in mind that would be to your own financial and political advantage far more 'negligent to science' than some skepticism about a study and its funding sources.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No not really.  Studies sponsored by an industry tend to support what the industry wants.  They look to hire researchers that are favorable to their industry, and if the results aren't too their liking, they're not required to publish them. 
Obviously, there are studies from independent sources that aren't biased, but generally they aren't sponsored by anyone with an agenda.  </TEXT>

The Democrats should also play this game.  Some former Presidential candidate should accuse Walker of hypocrisy and dishonesty, and then everyone can say that they don't know if Walker is a hypocritical liar, Make it part of the public discussion.
