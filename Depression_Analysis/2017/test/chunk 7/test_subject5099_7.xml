	<TEXT> With the Departure of Nisovin and Rob, I will be following and supporting them like I did when I first joined PlayMindcrack. I hope the best for Guude, and I hope that maybe he can do something to keep his server alive too, but at it's core, Nisovin and Rob were PMC, they were the games, and they were AT LEAST half the community, and I will stick by their side, as I have from the start. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Time to go, although, while being known for what you do is nice and all, I wasn't known at all on the gym until I became 10th on the leaderboard, that's when I go noticed. However, even if getting noticed is a good thing to come from the boards, they do so much more damage than good to me, and others, so it seems. The board should be removed, that's my opinion. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Honestly, although matt is in a case of ban evasion, he was only banned for bad fellowship, and so he himself is not cheating, and all his kills are legit, as one person, as much as he can play. FWP is not one person, can play any maximum of its time its members are on, and while there isn't modded clients in use as far as we know, and play time is not a bannable by any means, it seems very unsportsman-like to use one single account just for the purpose of bringing someone who got all his kills as one person, fairly, down, just on account of his past ban that doesn't have anything to do with his ability to kill.

tl;dr, Op got his kills as one person, fairly, it's unsportsmanlike to use a group on one account to do the same. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sadly, I would not put it past some people that were once or still are in the community to do these things. Some groups are maliciously toxic, while others are very very nice. The thing is, those that are toxic are sometimes the popular ones, and they are part of the reason I am no longer playing on the server. My situation, as well as another friend of mine's are very similar to your's in terms of falling into a depression. I do not attribute these people alone as the cause of this, but I do site them as partial reason, as well as the boards, and other goings on in my life. It makes me very sad to see a community fall into something like this, but I am happy that someone brought it to light, something I couldn't do. </TEXT>

PS: Why is this downvoted? are you serious? It was a statement, my god.

PSS: This community is so broken now, all these downvotes on Mae's statements even though he is just trying to show his point, quite sad guys. People have opinions, they aren't necessarily wrong, and he has no reason to be downvoted. </TEXT>
