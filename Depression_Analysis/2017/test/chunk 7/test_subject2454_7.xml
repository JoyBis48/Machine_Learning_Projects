	<TEXT> Sorry about that.
I'm in the U.S., and honestly would look to move anywhere.  Third world countries are doable for me.

I'm interested in any kind of job, really.  I'm stuck in a dead end job at the moment, with absolutely no prospects of advancements, in one of the most expensive markets in the country.  I will not be able to save money if I live here long term.

My work experience is varied, but always with small business.  I started out with a small computer store, which did mainly tech support and custom machines.  I worked for a medical equipment company, and now am in the jewelry business.  Basically, everywhere I went, I helped the company grow by actively taking a management role with a lot of responsibilities under me.  I ended up leaving each company because they were family businesses.  The problem is, that this is all I know how to do now.  I have no corporate or government experience what so ever.

I speak English and Urdu fluently.  But I am only literate in English.  I would definitely be willing to learn a new language for the right opportunity.

Is age a factor?  34M </TEXT>
