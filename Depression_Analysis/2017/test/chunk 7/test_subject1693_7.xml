	<TEXT> Brian Jonestown Massacre's Sound of Confusion is amazing. It's more of a compilation of like six songs with some background noise in the beginning but it's great. The Wiper's Youth of America is amazing and is very punk rock with a very nice riff. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you like indie check out The Virgins, they have some very catchy tunes. If you like 80's or 90's real alternative Teenage Fanclub is great (I Don't Know and Don't Look Back are my favorites). But if you want something more current check out Pity Sex they have an album called Feast of Love and a song on it called Drown Me Out. Also Title Fight have a song called Your Pain Is Mine should satisfy your cravings. Please let me know how it works out! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think the Stooges put out their best record first. Everyone always talks about Fun House and Raw Power but they overlook The Stooges. It had the best out of place ballad-y songs using like five chords and Ron Ashton going crazy on his solos. </TEXT>
