	<TEXT> I used to like him. Now I don't. You are the poster child for why I don't. He brings fools in his wake, and it's not good for the culture. This is a team,  he's an island. A loser of an island that can't get off my Browns fast enough. I pray that he does something so inappropriate in the off season that the front office has no choice but to fire him. Shaw takes the helm and  takes us to 3 super bowls. We only win one, but we beat Denver for the AFC title each time.  I also hope it makes you see how horrible he is. I also hope he goes to Oakland.  I also hope you have a dream tonight about having sex with your grandma. Sorry to be so vague about my feelings. 'Nite. </TEXT>

 Annoying because I'm not blinded by the first glimpse of hope.

	<TEXT> I think maybe we are missing each other due to each of our definition of "calling for his head". I remember the throngs of folks making fun of others because "You don't draft a QB at 22  and then run a perennial backup" and the throngs of all caps posts about just that subject, we're pretty vitriolic.  </TEXT>

Shaw, Hoyer, Manziel, Mariota, mother fuckin' Jay Cutler, a walk on who I don't know and have never heard of. We aren't a cult of personality, we are a team. So I'm rooting for my team.  </TEXT>
