	<TEXT> Because using blankets would take away the integrity of it being a pillow fort. As soon as they used blankets, it would no longer be a pillow fort, it would be a blanket and pillow fort, and thats not what they set out to do. Abed was just keeping with their original objective. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Trouble encoding 1080p files </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Running [Windows 7](http://imgur.com/gDygYT2), using Adobe Media Encoder. Whenever I bring in an AfterEffects composition and render out a Quicktime file using the H.264 codec at 720p, it works fine. The problem is occurring when I try to render it out at 1080p. The render fails as soon as it starts, and the Error Log simply says "Error compiling movie. Unknown error." Why is this happening, and what can I do to fix it? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ok, am I the only one who's tired of girls like this "oh, i'm curious whether or not I look good." Girl, please, you know you look amazing! Don't act like you don't know that your eyes are impossibly stunning, or your face isn't unbelievably beautiful, and don't even get me started on that smile, casue I honestly, can't even find the words. And then you top it off with a body picture, that honestly, looks like you belong in a magazine. The only negative thing I can say is that you're too perfect, but that's just being petty at this point, lol. </TEXT>
