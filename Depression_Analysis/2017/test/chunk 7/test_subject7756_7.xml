What would be non-threatening to you, a civilian, would be seen thru the lens of a soldier who has had multiple encounters in combat. </TEXT>

seriously, your reaction is pretty much well within the bounds of transition. keep a record for your timeline, you'll see the diff.

	<TEXT> let's take it from the top, shall we?

someone's sexuality is literally none of your goddamn business. if they want to serve their country by joining up, then more power to them. YOU  do not get a say. 

end of story. there's no big discussion to be had. sexuality has nothing to do with how well you do your job. the only problem arises when OTHER people go out of their way to make it a problem.

get over it, people are gay. people have been gay since the dawn of time. people will continue to be gay, wanna know why? because they're born that way.

seriously, join the 21st century already, we're moving on, so come along or get out the way. no one is stopping for you. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> i know what you're asking, but i would be remiss if i didnt first start out by saying that we always recommend going thru a therapist/endo/GP first. that's because there is no such thing as a "standard dose" when it comes to HRT. everyone's body reacts differently, so it's always advisable to have a medical professional oversee your hormone therapy, especially since it's relatively easy to get to an informed consent clinic.

that being said, a great many people here, for one reason or another, do NOT have access to hrt with a prescription, and so choose to self-med. there are no judgments from any of us. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> have to preface this with the usual "I AM NOT A DOCTOR"

First off, your body is adjusting to running off new hormones, it's going to feel uncomfortable for a bit. and because everyone's body is different, we all adjust to it differently.

So here's what my endo told me about the first few doses, that your body will see the influx of estrogen as a sign that the testicles are failing, and it will signal your gonads to kick into overdrive, i.e. to produce MORE testosterone. after a few more shots, your body will interpret that as the new normal, and send a signal to shut down the production of T.

some people also go on an emotional rollercoaster, i had one time where i had to pull over to the side of the road and bawl my eyes out, for no reason.

and as for looks? yeah, that inbetweeny stage is a royal bitch, i aint gonna lie. but you HAVE to ride it out, trust me on this one. it gets WAY better on the other side.

tl;dr: it's normal, it will pass, hold on, it'll get better </TEXT>

	<TEXT> no, equality is never a problem. bigotry is. once you stop operating from a position that heterosexuality is the only option, the better off we will all be. 

there have been no issues with gay people serving in the US army regarding their sexuality. 

i'll go one step further, there are no issues with gay people in general, regarding their sexuality. 

the only problems arise when other people go out of their way to be bigots and make other people's sexuality their problem.

who people sleep with behind closed doors is none of your business. 

thank you for your time.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> i'm leaving their comment up because you have an excellent reply, even tho their account was a throwaway. it's not the first time it was brought up, and it wont be the last, so the more often we reply to it, the more little bits and pieces of a rational repudiation of that position gets added to the narrative. </TEXT>
