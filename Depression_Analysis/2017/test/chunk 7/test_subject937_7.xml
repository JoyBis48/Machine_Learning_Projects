	<TEXT> No, stop with _your_ nonsense. Executive Agreements have the force of law, and are treaties on the international level.

Treaties ratified pursuant to the Treaty Clause are not the only legal treaties in the U.S.

	<TEXT> Understanding the Constitution requires more than merely reading it. There are centuries of practice and case law.

For example, there are 3 types of treaties, not just 1.  The President can enter into an executive agreement and on the international stage, it is just as much a treaty as one ratified by 2/3s of the Senate.

Also, it's undeniable that the President is in charge of negotiating foreign policy. I agree what they did wasn't treason, but it was highly inappropriate and they should be publicly shamed. Senators get to weigh in on foreign affairs in various ways. This is not one of them. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Bill claimed to be filming in a war zone, but he wasn't stating that it was a literal war zone.

This seems very generous to Bill O'Reilly. He repeatedly used his experience in a "war zone" to bolster his credibility on war reporting.

Every quote I've read has no hint of anything other than a literal interpretation of "war zone".

Edit: This is a good example of what I'm talking about (from the [_Mother Jones_ article](http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2015/02/bill-oreilly-brian-williams-falklands-war)):

In a 2004 column about US soldiers fighting in Iraq, O'Reilly noted, "Having survived a combat situation in Argentina during the Falklands war, I know that life-and-death decisions are made in a flash." </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  47% (at the time, might be more or less now) of the US population pays nothing in federal income tax.

Romney's problem with that comment was going from "doesn't pay federal income taxes" to "dependent upon government, ... believe[s] that they are victims, ... believe[s] the government has a responsibility to care for them, ... believe[s] that they are entitled to health care, to food, to housing", and then after all that claiming that "[he'll] never convince them they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives."

Telling anyone who received a federal tax refund that they do not take personal responsibility and care for their lives is an extremely idiotic thing to do. </TEXT>

I don't disagree with this but it's a package deal most of the time. We've all seen the pictures of the Great Pyramids from Pizza Hut, and there is a McDonalds seemingly every few miles in Paris.

Simply put, where there is economic activity, chains are going to exist. A restaurant like Chipotle isn't necessarily a good thing to me personally, but I do recognize that it represents a growing local economy.

And that *is* a good thing to me personally. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks for the source. That will definitely complicate things for her, in my opinion.

Wouldn't there be only one of two possibilities here? (1) He was being detained or (2) he was not being detained (he clearly wasn't under arrest).

If he was being detained, there needs to be reasonable suspicion of criminal activity. What is the reasonable suspicion here? If the police officer does not have reasonable suspicion, he can just walk away. Likewise, if he was not being detained, he can just walk away. And that is even more so the case if the officer is simply taking his picture as a member of the public. Forcing him to stay would be false imprisonment in that situation (and there would be no investigation for her to interfere with).

As for an ongoing criminal investigation, wouldn't he be entitled to access to counsel if that was the case? It's not like this was immediately post-arrest (e.g. mugshot). This was outside of a courtroom after a hearing. </TEXT>
