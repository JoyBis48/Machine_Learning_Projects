	<TEXT> My English teacher during my senior year of high school was one of the coolest people I've known. He was open to ideas and encouraged creativity, no matter how crazy it might have seemed. 

He only had one flaw, he would return papers weeks, if not even months, after they had been turned in. We wrote a long paper at the beginning of the second semester (January/February) and did not get them back until the night of graduation.

Ran in to him at a party a few years back. He had moved to the same college town to get his Masters. Found out that the reason it took him so long to return papers and have everything graded was due to the fact he had severe depression and teaching was the only thing that kept him going.

He's now married and has a wonderful life doing what he loves.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My health. Being dizzy makes being productive extremely difficult. As so I'm left feeling pessimistic on a daily basis. I lost my job last week, so that hasn't helped much, and it was due to being dizzy. I hope to go back to school in the fall, but I have spent the past week trying to get ahold of the admissions office and the administrator for the school, and so far nothing. 

My job was working as a SPED Paraeducator at an elementary school. My dream job is to work as an Art Therapist helping children and adolescents.

Shitty health + losing job because of health + awaiting an important phone call = a shitty time

	<TEXT> Had that happen last week. Worked at an elementary school as a SPED Paraeducator. Every Wednesday we had a collaborative meeting from 13:15-14:30. Right after it was over, I went out in to the hallway and waited for the teachers I usually helped after school - worked until 15:30. 

My boss walks up to me and tells me that we need to go to the Principal's office to discuss the SPED department. Arrive at his office to see that it was just the three of us.

After the meeting ended, I continued to do my job as usual and helped the teachers as I had every day up to that point. One started to cry when she found out I was leaving. I really loved that job and miss working with the kids.

I was fired because of health reasons. I knew working the position might not pan out too well, so I decided to get the job through a temp agency. I have these wonderful things called inner ear disorders. Last semester was great because I was split between every grade. I ended up getting sick during the first week back and missed two days of work. My schedule had me working with a 3rd grade student most of the day, and when I wasn't with her, I spent my time with a kindergarten class. Those times included recess (of which all were indoor that week) and their 'choice time', which is like recess, but the noise level is 100x worse.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The afternoon of May 31st, 1990 I was walking with my babysitter. A teenage driver took her eyes off of the road and hit what she thought was a bump in the road. I was drug 20ft down a dirt road. Resulted in physical and mental impairments. Went from being a cheerful 3year old to someone completely different. Plus I looked...well not normal. People are mean and were mean throughout my childhood and early adult life. I under went 2-3 dozen facial reconstructive surgeries from the age of four until I turned 17. I'll need more in the future for structural reasons. 

Everyone in my family is quite intelligent, except for me. Reasons for that are due in part to the head trauma. I'm not dumb by any means but I'm stuck with limitations that make it difficult to get to where I would like to be. 

My life is great now, but only because I met people who actually cared enough to get to know me. I have two mottos to life: "Be who you are, not what's cool" - Chef from South Park's episode 'South Park is Gay'; and "I've lived a life no one can relate and few will understand."

	<TEXT> My health went to shit back in 2008 and I have had inner-ear problems since then. Over the course of several years I lost hope of ever feeling better and stopped doing most things I enjoyed. Now I'm substantially better because I know how to control the problem (took all but 5 years), but I'm afraid to return to what I once loved. I do not want to have to relearn something that once came to me naturally. I also can't run without feeling sick. Running always helped me relieve stress. It hasn't been an option for several years now.

One student in particular was a brainiac when it came to the subject and seemed to have really enjoyed the subject. Their class had a end of the year celebration on the last day of school and parents were welcome to attend. She played off like she didn't understand the same work she had just completed when her dad asker her about a problem. When I commented on this, her father said she often did this around him. I was left speechless and completely mystified as to why she did this. She has a younger sister in 3rd grade and I often wonder if her sister does the same thing.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Why just once a year? Every month should have one day where a city takes time to conserve energy for an hour. Smaller cities could extend the time or number of days, but it would depend upon what the city allows. 


One hour to see the true night sky should be easy to come by. We can survive at least one hour with out unnecessary light. 

The only limitations would be for planes flying. I do not know if that would disrupt their flying; by not being able to see ground lights. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The Jazzhaus is supposedly haunted, but nothing happens until after it closes to the public. 

I knew a few bartenders and they often shared this. I asked to go upstairs and wait for a ride, but they said it was not allowed due to the 'ghost'. 

A room at The Eldridge is said to be haunted, if not a majority of the rooms on the 5th floor.  </TEXT>

What's the point of all your education and research if your hard-earned MAs don't mean jack?

How did I miss the point? A PhD is not required for the field.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> How does that have to do with competencies? The job I hope to be certified for has nothing to do with working on a computer and in a timely fashion. 

Let me explain myself a little bit more....

I am in the process of obtaining a masters in clinical psychology AND art therapy. My dream job is to provide aid to those who struggle through life by showing them the powers of art - through various mediums. 

Why should I be judged for taking the test format you feel is necessary when it has nothing to do with my desired career? 

People are often left with debilitating circumstances in their lives and deserve to be granted the same opportunities as the able bodied. I didn't ask to receive a TBI as a child and should not be held back by limitations granted through the testing procedures that you find are necessary; when I can qualify for testing that fits my needs. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There are ways around taking the computerized test. If the test taker has a documented learning disability, they are allowed to use a paper version - this is what I know about the GRE.

If that is not allowed for the GED, then the system will reach a whole new level of screwing people over who wish to better their lives.

If a male employee were to leave the seat up, they'd all know within a short time upon going to the bathroom. Plus there are pictures of the most strict of all the paras hanging around the school. One stares at you when you're in the bathroom. 

tl;dr: use scare tactics or other means of communication to alert those who fail to make peace with the toilet gods.
