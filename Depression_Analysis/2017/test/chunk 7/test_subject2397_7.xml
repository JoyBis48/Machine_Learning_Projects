	<TEXT> Without being quantitative here I seriously think they drink every day to some degree or another, sometimes starting at about 8am. It's hard to tell what days they actually are in the bar since there's no definitive time line in the episodes. Some episodes span over weeks while others are days. Or in the case of season 9, about 10 minutes lol </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I love this episode. Jorge Garcia playing the Blitz was hilarious like when he yells out the numbers from Lost. I also like this episode because they travel around alot. Seeing them in the bar and Ted's apartment gets kindof old after awhile but them driving around was pretty funny.  And seeing Barney's cardboard oven "I should probably disconnect the gas then" </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think not at all. For one, even with all the knowledge at my fingertips I hardly look it up. In fact I'm sitting in a library right now with enough books to easily become a heart and brain surgeon but I'm not reading them because I'm not motivated to on my own. School has structure, and teaches you how to learn things, and you can interact with others. And if you've ever taken an online class you know they're just not as enjoyable as the classroom setting </TEXT>

Not just renting the blue instrumented band but it also looks like there's about $100 worth of roses in the room. I guess looking back it just seems like Ted really was desperate for her </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I loved Robin all the up til about season 8. It started with her yelling at Patrice which I just found really annoying. Then in Season 9 when she was fighting with her mother in law the day before the wedding was not funny it was just painful.  Finally she just continued to be independent to the point where she only cared for herself </TEXT>
