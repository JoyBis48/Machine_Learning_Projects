	<TEXT> I don't believe that to be true. People are still going to college; they wouldn't pay for the means to pursue higher education, they would just get a job or learn a trade. Value does not have to produce tangible objects like jobs or money--I would like to think that value is a little more intrinsic than just an outcome. Like I said, value is something that can be perceived and applied differently for everyone. For some it can be just getting a job, while for others it can be simple fact of loving to acquire new knowledge.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Lmao, if they had mentioned Putin or Russia then you have a point. But when you have a show where Russia nor Putin have any editorial power it makes your argument/rant simply inapplicable to the circumstance--mainly because it's about Putin and Russia and not Thom or Bernie. Again, just my opinion.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We have very different perspectives, to say the least. When I value an opinion of someone I don't let a watermark dictate whether or not to share it with the Bernie community. As I see it there are two choices: I can not post it and some may stumble upon the video on their own, but on the other hand, many won't--and for me the most important factor is sharing what I perceive to be as valuable content. I obviously chose to post it for the reason that it may help someone to understand why Bernie is downplayed in the main stream media. Some may hate it, like it or even love it--but the notion that this may open up a dialogue or introduce different perspectives to other people trumps the fact that RT licenses his show (at least for me). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Research his affiliation with RT before citing their past news coverage because once again, RT has no editorial power over Thom's show. They LICENSE it to run on their network and in turn Thom is able to use their studio. All employees are under Thom's company and have zero connection to RT other than the equipment being used which also means Thom decides what will be on his show and he has also said in interviews that he wouldn't have made this agreement if they wanted to dictate what was on the show as well as having any editorial power. Since that isn't the case, RT does not have any power and this is the only reason why Thom agreed to have them LICENSE the show--Larry King has also said the same thing about his setup with RT.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You obviously don't understand that Thom runs the show and the employee are listed under his company. RT has no editorial power because they only license his show to run on their network and in turn they let him use the studio. Furthermore, this show also airs on free speech TV where Thom does his radio show. Please do some research before concocting outrageous claims. On top of all this, Bernie and Thom have been doing brunch with Bernie for 9 years so I really don't think your claim holds any strength. Lastly, Bernie did an interview on politicking with Larry King which is also licensed by RT so, I think he knows and I think you should know the *facts* as well.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thom licenses his show through RT and they supply him with the studio--however, Thom employs all of the workers and has the editorial power. Therefore, RT is not allowed to dictate what Thom talks about nor do they supply him with employees (Thom pays his workers under his company)--it's the same deal that Larry King has with his Politicking show. Check wiki to fact check everything--although I don't think I'm very far off. Sorry @ work in between patients so I can't double check everything now.  </TEXT>
