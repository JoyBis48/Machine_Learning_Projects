	<TEXT> Lol lol I wasn't upset at her when she wore the same color.  I felt more bad  for her cause people noticed.  It also didn't help that it was the first time I'd seen her.... so I didn't know who this extra bridesmaid was lol.  I can't imagine how badly you must had felt.  Good thing something always goes wrong at weddings so hopefully your crime wasn't the worst.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I know the whole thing sounds so strange, but I'm definitely not drinking or have anxiety about flying.  The worst thing flight I've had was from LA to Denver.  Then it took 5 days before I felt better :(. I'm not sure about dehydration, but maybe I should drink more water the day before flying. This whole thing is just such a mystery and I haven't met anyone else that have had this problem. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm actually not afraid of flying and even though I dry heave, I'm not actually nauseous.  I've tried to suck on ginger candies but the dry heaving doesn't go away.  I've tried taking Bonine but it didn't help either.  One time I took NyQuil which helped me fall asleep, but after 2 hours I woke up with the same symptoms plus body aches :( </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I make soap and sell soap, but I still love trying out other people's products :).  I love looking at the ingredients label so anything with fun or exotic butters always catches my eye.  I love an all olive oil soap but I know that it's going to be a little slimy in the shower and have little lather.  I don't personally care if it's colored, but I do LOVE a good exfoliation soap for my body.  For my face I like an unscented or very lightly scented with essential oils, uncolored, bar of soap made with lots of olive oil. </TEXT>
