	<TEXT> Yes and no. While HIV cannot kill you, when it turns to AIDS it can. However, we are no longer in the 1980s. People can go 20 or more years without HIV turning to AIDS. Even when it does change over, it is no longer the death sentence that it once was. It is fairly easily managed and medical researchers have managed to bring viral load levels down so low that it is nearly undetectable, effectively curing the virus, but with the stipulation that one must remain on antiretroviral medication for life. While AIDS was a deadly epidemic at one time, it is now closer to the flu; some people will die, but many more, with effective treatment, will be fine for a very long time. Since we don't arrest people for going out when sick and knowingly passing it along by touching things in public, it's a bit of a stretch to say that its attempted murder. More sensible would be a charge for fraud and a charge for assault, but that's just my opinion. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes and no. My "type" of lesbian is called boidyke. That means I'm a young, butch lesbian that isn't ultra masculine. Often, people like me wear the same clothes as men and boys a few years younger. Obviously, if stores took advantage of that, they'd lose a lot of sales to said boys. There are a handful of smaller name designers that focus on clothes for women who are masculine. I generally learn about them online. There are even maternity brands dedicated to masculine people. I belong to such a small demographic that for anything that is big name it isn't worth the money and potential loss to market to me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Also great to ensure safety of patients! Abortions can have unintended complications that require more than what is available outpatient. 

Edit: I'm not saying outpatient is bad, I'm saying that hospital procedures can be better. Diner food isn't bad, but restaurant food can be better; it's all about what you want. What I would want is the best safety net possible. </TEXT>

Children should not be sexualized. Tankini style suits are okay as long as the bottom is shorts style, not like a bikin, in my opinion for my children. </TEXT>
