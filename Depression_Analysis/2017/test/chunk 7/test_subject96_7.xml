	<TEXT> I guess. 

But a traditional  hearing aid is just an amplifier. Modern ones can select out certain frequency ranges to amplify, but that's pretty much all they do.

These devices can amplify or muffle certain frequencies or add processing on top of that. These could have come in handy back in the day when I used to go clubbing. The music was always too loud for me and it impeded my ability to chat up pretty girls.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The remake of Big Trouble is probably going to be terrible, because most remakes are pretty terrible. But it's not going to be terrible because The Rock is going to be playing Jack Burton.

Look, most of us who are fans of the movie get the central joke of the film. Jack Burton, the putative hero of the piece, is actually the goofy, comic relief. 

So there's some concern that, with Johnson playing the main role, Burton will be a straight ahead action dude, thus ruining the movie. 

But Johnson has the talent and the inclination to play silly, goofy roles. He's never been just a straight action hero. Go watch him in Be Cool or The Tooth Fairy. And I think he's smart enough to know what paying this character is going to require from him. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Also, as a 1099 contractor, there are things you can deduct from your taxes that you can't as an employee. 

For example, keep track of your travel.  As an employee, commuting is on you and you can't write that off. As a contractor, you'll be able to deduct the IRS rate for every mile you drive work work.

Here's a good [1099 primer](https://tryzen99.com/blog_posts/the-7-most-common-1099-tax-mistakes)

If you're going to be doing this long-term, spend a little money and consult with a tax professional. A little money now could save you a lot of money down the road.

Also, as an aside, the IRS has some pretty strict rules about who is allowed to get a 1099 and who must be paid on a W2. If you are treated like an employee and paid with a 1099, the IRS can bring the hammer down on your employer in a big way. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't see the point of trying to bullshit about this. The cat's out of the bag. He knows you went on an interview, so he knows you've been looking for a new position.

Come Monday, don't mealy mouth it. Be honest, but respectful. When he asks you what your plans are, turn it around and ask him what his plans are for you. 

Tell him you've been working there for a year, for low pay. He just denied you a raise. Yet your position is so vital they you can't even take a sick day. He basically forced your hand.

Don't be a jerk, but don't be weak. Believe in your own value. If he doesn't want you to look for a new position, make him to convince you why you shouldn't. Ask for firm commitments.

Hey, maybe he's an asshole and fires you anyway, either now or in a few months. But you're not going to avoid that with lies and bullshit.

And from now on, keep your mouth shut. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The thing is, sometimes you have to be blunt. Some people just refuse to take the hint. 

Guys like Steve rely on the fact that most people try to be accommodating and helpful when then can and don't like to give a flat no. 

There will probably come a time when you realize that all of your attempts to deflect and redirect Steve just aren't working and you'll have to flat out tell him no. Be prepared for that.

Just remember, no can be a complete sentence. There's no need to explain. No, I can't. No, I won't. I'm sorry, no. No. No. No.

Best of luck to you. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes. I dated this one girl. She was actually my first. She took my v-card and then dumped me a week later to date one of my friends.

Then, about a year later, she dumped him and started dating me again. We were together for the whole summer. I started a new job in August and she dumped me a couple weeks after that.

She ended up marrying one of my (other) friends and moved with him to live in a trailer park in Montana. That didn't last and they headed back east and split up.  

I got married (to someone else) and lost track of her after a while. A couple years back I decided to Google stalk her and found her FB page. We reconnected a bit and had lunch last year when she was in town.  </TEXT>
