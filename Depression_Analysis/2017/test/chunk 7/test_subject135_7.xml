	<TEXT> Until I got to Reddit I had no idea that people saw images in their head when they read since I never have. Hasn't stopped me from getting wrapped up in books and being able to suspend disbelief when necessary. At the same time, yes, I dislike epic/high fantasy because there's so much description that does nothing for me -- it just drags down the pace of the story. I do like urban and comic fantasy because they tend to dispense with all that wordiness. I also read a variety of other genres. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is not correct. The Bible gave signs for which mammals were allowed to be eaten and which weren't. They are: split hooves and chewing their cud. Pigs are singled out for special mention because they have split hooves but don't chew their cud. Three other animals are singled out for chewing their cud but not having split hooves but since they're not commonly eaten anyway, people tend to forget about them.

It has nothing to do with dirt or trichinosis.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It feels really awkward to call someone for no reason, mostly because I can't stop thinking that the other person has better things to do and wants to get off the phone.

You need to trust that your friends want to talk to you. If they don't, then you might want to reconsider whether they're actually your friends or not.

I have friends that I talk to for two hours every week, I have friends I talk to for an hour a month. I chit-chat with my mother for about five minutes at a time multiple times a week sometimes. It entirely depends on what your schedule is, their schedule is, and what you have to say to each other. 

Lately I've found some of my conversations start awkwardly, like we're both being polite about letting the other person go first. I need to start being more assertive because one of my friends tends to monopolize the conversation if I let her go first.

The conversations end when it's time to go to bed or it's time to go do something such as putting the kids to bed or taking the cake out of the oven or switching over the laundry from the washing machine to the dryer. </TEXT>

1. Don't multitask. If you're sitting in a restaurant with your friend you might both be eating, but you're not doing the laundry or walking the dog or sending out resumes. There's no reason why you should be multitasking just because you're sitting at home.

2. If you simply must multitask, get some kind of hands-free device or put the call on speakerphone. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not quite.

Whether a particular type of bird flies south for the winter depends mainly on one thing: what type of food it eats.

In areas that have cold winters, some common bird foods, such as nectar and insects, may not be available year-round. Birds that eat those foods must fly south to find food to survive. Other birds that eat seeds or bugs that live under tree bark often hang around, since they can continue to find food all winter long.

	<TEXT> If they weren't Orthodox Jews/followers of the Shabbos, this tragedy would not have occurred.

This is false. 

Hot plates are commonly used items. 

They are safe to use.

They are not safe to misuse.

It is not a religious requirement to misuse a hot plate.

The tragedy occurred because of their misuse of the hot plate.

Of course I know what you're trying to say, and you're mistaken. The only way you'd be correct is if hot plates were inherently unsafe and Orthodox Jews insisted on using them anyway. This is clearly not the case. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I reread your post and I just want to make sure we are on the same page: you understand they left the hot plate on on purpose right? In order to avoid using electricity/flicking a switch on their religious holiday.

Which was completely unnecessary. In other words: not a religious requirement. Most people use timers to turn them on and off automatically. There's a guy in this thread who copped to leaving his hot plate on all Sabbath. You can ask him why he thinks it's safe despite the fact that we have proof that it isn't. And if he says "because their hot plate was malfunctioning and mine isn't," then he's clearly just as thoughtless as these people. Nobody knowingly uses a malfunctioning hot plate. In fact, I'm not sure there's anything he could say that wouldn't prove that he's being thoughtless.

Sorry for the idiot comment, it was out of line. it's just such a frustrating situation my emotions got the best of me.

Thanks. </TEXT>
