	<TEXT> A leaked report regarding Park View school has been [obtained by the BBC](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-27757987) 

 This highly-critical report found a classroom culture in which Park View School was not welcoming to non-Muslim pupils. It described a "madrassa curriculum" in PHSE (personal, social, health and economic) lessons and "posters written in Quranic Arabic in most of the classrooms visited"... and there were claims of an inappropriate external speaker being brought it to talk to pupils.

If you Google it there are plenty of pictures of the classrooms on the school's website too. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The vast majority of schools in the UK, regardless of if they are fee paying, have uniforms. The schools involved are all non fee paying, taxpayer funded. Blazers (in the summer) and headscarves are not a compulsory part of the uniform for obvious reasons but the few little girls who didn't totally cover themselves were openly referred to as the 'white prostitutes'.  </TEXT>
