	<TEXT> You're going to want to get her to a therapist. You have to do so in a way that's supportive and shows how important it is to better deal with this, to make things like watching a movie easier. It's not because she's crazy, but anyone that has went through this should have counseling. I suggest you go as well. I feel like her mom needs to know. But you can't be the one to say anything. If she was a good mom, she wouldn't let her daughter feel uncomfortable with the man together. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm writing this from my new phone that seems to be malfunctioning so forgive me if it's hard to read.

He said I would move to somewhere with palm trees soon. (I was moving to Florida the following week). Said I would get into trouble with someone named ****. And that this guy was talking to other people and that would get me in trouble. (Not sure on this one. I had met a drug dealer with the same name, a month later I was supposed to pick up and the day of our plans he got arrested, lost big money. Then later found another guy with same name --all within the same week-- as soon as he told me his name I called it quits because of what the psychic said. Could have put me in jail for a felony). Hmm what else, he said I'd have to make a big move in march and id be deciding between 3 places. It'd be a big decision but the decision I would make would be the best one (I did end up moving mid march because something bad happened. Was deciding between living in Florida, home, or with a relative.) Also, said I'm one to "cover my mouth" and not speak up. But I will and it will get me to a better place. Well, what happened during those rough months was due to me speaking up to my boss, which may have been bad to say but it turned out for the best.

Basically said I'd be okay and that I was kinda fucked up be okay. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A guy that looked homeless (lack of a better word) came up to me while I was with my friend at a coffee shop. We were there gossiping about who knows what, never saw him come in or sit down. Then told me he was a reader. Then proceeded to read me, tell me my future. Everything has come true, including dates and names. He was very modest, left abruptly, didn't even let me say thank you (I was like WTF, what do I even say to this guy? Made sure to keep a straight face and not really respond to what he said to lead him on). He left. Just disappeared. I have no idea if he had a car or just walked in to talk to me. Very strange but cool. I've been a mess this past year so I'm sure I have a lot of energy and emit some interesting waves.  </TEXT>
