The last thing to keep in mind here is that people who answered this question primary come from Reddit and Voat, so naturally, we are expecting the younger generation here (likely around the 2030 range). Gallup, for example, did similar polls and their results (which should be more representative) demonstrate entirely different results. </TEXT>

The belief is that this will same time and encourage more sign ups, but obviously it's possible that one is wasting his time because nobody would sign up using their social media accounts in the first place. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> The traits of a great Startup Adisvor </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-06-30 19:23:59 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Original Source: https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/traits-great-startup-advisor-mark-macleod

The two things I love to do most are advise founders   their teams plus close complex financial transactions. I love those things so much that I created SurePath Capital Partners so that I could do them all day long! Its been just over two months now since I launched SurePath and its going better than I ever imagined. As Ive settled into this new role, Ive been thinking about what it means to be a great Startup advisor. Here are my thoughts.

Its very common for startups to add advisors. Those advisors come in all shapes and sizes. Most advise on the side while they do something else. That can lead to inconsistent experiences. Ironically, the more prominent that person is, the more disappointing the experience is. With rare exceptions, if you have some A list startup celeb advising you, you might get some great intros, but they will be too busy being their fabulous selves to really engage.

Another common pitfall with advisors is signing up the person with one big win. Often that persons advice consists of telling you what worked at that big win. But you cant just copy. The context is different every time.

In my humble and completely biased opinion, here are the traits that I think the best startup advisors needs to have:

Broad   diverse experience: Its only from going through multiple companies, winners, losers, down markets and upmarkets that you can be a great advisor in good times and bad. You need multiple data points, and the pattern-matching ability that only comes through being in the trenches for a long time.

Client orientation: I began my career in public accounting and spent 6 years in professional services. I grew up career-wise having clients. Whether you started off in consulting or some other services industry or whether service is just a core value, this client orientation is must if you want to offer great advice.

An important aspect of a client orientation is that its never about the advisor! I have listened to prominent, twitter famous advisors blather on incessantly because they love the sound of their voice. Thats just painful. No matter how experienced you are, it should never be about you. Its always about the client.

Objective: The best advisors have no personal agenda. They simply help you sort through the issues and offer up unbiased thoughts and answers. This is a common criticism I hear from founders regarding investors. Its not that they dont trust their investors. But they are aware that while their investors bring great advice and experience, they also manage a fund and have to deliver returns. That can sometimes compromise objectivity.

Another element of objectivity is not getting caught up in the drama. Startups are full of highs and lows. Often in the same day. The best advisors are sympathetic to that but dont get caught up in that themselves.

Solutions first: Its not all that valuable to raise issues or problems without also offering up potential solutions. The last thing a founder needs is more unsolved problems.

Anticipation: If you have deep experience and you have a client first orientation, youre likely going to think of issues and opportunities before your client does. Thats magic.

Coach: The most prominent tech advisor is Bill Campbell, who is known as the Coach. He was a football coach before going on to coach Steve Jobs, Marc Andreessen, Ben Horowitz and many other prominent execs. The thing with coaches (vs. advisors) is they help you arrive at the answer yourself rather than just tell you the answer. That is so powerful.

So, thats my recipe for a great advisor. Am I missing anything? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Question 1: Do you think Greece will remain in the EU given its growing concern of defaulting?

I've created a poll to help tally up opinions. Please vote http://thearima.com/questions/do-you-think-greece-will-remain-in-the-eu-given-its-growing-concern-of-defaulting.

My personal guess this some sort of bailout will be reached at the end (as that's what has always happened). Greece will remain in the EU.

Question 2: Will you adjust your investment strategies in the next few days/weeks according?

I bought some VIX etfs last week, and have happily enjoyed my 30% gain today. Given my answer to the first question (i.e. they will stay in the EU), I would likely clearly out my position in the next few days as I think the VIX index will rise a bit more and then go back down.

I'd love to hear your thoughts! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't necessarily think machine learning requires ODE specifically, but I think it's always good to learn some things other than what you will need. ODE (and later on PDE) is very useful for many modelling related problem and is particularly useful for financial problems. I think it's always good to learn a course on that.

BTW, I think in stochastic processes you will need some ODE, and stochastic analysis is used in machine learning. </TEXT>
