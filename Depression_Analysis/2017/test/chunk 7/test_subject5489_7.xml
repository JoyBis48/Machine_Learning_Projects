	<TEXT> so in california, the californian fan palm sheds its fans along side its trunk, like a scarf on a neck. this insulates the tree at night, where temperatures in the desert can drop below freezing. this creates refuge for a plethora of animals that can eat the fruits, carry the seeds, help pollinate the plant, and give nutrients to the soil.

some other cool facts about them, they are exactly the correct height to protect them from columbian mammoths, their top predator, once upon a time. the native americans would seek the trees out, as they grew where the water was. they would burn the dead fans on the trunk to scare all the little animals away (think snakes, mice, spiders, bats, birds, etc.). </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  The main difference between animal emotions and human emotions is that animals don't have mixed emotions the way normal people do. Animals aren't ambivalent; they don't have love-hate relationships with each other or with people. That's one of the reasons humans love animals so much; animals are loyal. If an animal loves you he loves you no matter what. He doesn't care what you look like or how much money you make.

This is another connection between autism and animals: autistic people have mostly simple emotions, too. That's why normal people describe us as innocent. An autistic person's feelings are direct and open, just like animal feelings. We don't hide our feelings, and we aren't ambivalent. I can't even imagine what it would be like to have feelings of love and hate for the same person.
Some people will probably think this is an insulting thing to say about autistic people, but one thing I appreciate about being autistic is that I don't have to deal with all the emotional craziness my students do. I had one fantastic student who flunked out of school because she broke up with her boyfriend. There's so much psychodrama in normal people's lives. Animals never have psychodrama.

Children don't, either. Emotionally, children are more like animals and autistic people, because children's frontal lobes are still growing and don't mature until sometime in early adulthood. I mentioned earlier that the frontal lobes are one big association cortex, tying everything together, including emotions like love and hate that would probably be better off staying separate. That's another reason why a dog can be like a person's child: children's emotions are straightforward and loyal like a dog's. A seven-year-old boy or girl will race through the house to greet Dad when he comes from work the same way a dog will. I think animals, children, and autistic people have simpler emotions because their brains have less ability to make connections, so their emotions stay more separate and compartmentalized.

Of course, no one knows why an autistic grown-up has trouble making connections, since our frontal lobes are normal-sized. All we know right now is that researchers find "decreased connectivity among cortical regions and between the cortex and subcortex." The way I visualize it is that a normal brain is like a big corporate office building with telephones, faxes, e-mail, messengers, people walking around and talking -- a big corporation has zillions of ways for messages to get from one place to another. The autistic brain is like the same big corporate office building where the only way for anyone to talk to anyone else is by fax. There's no telephone, no e-mail, no messengers, and no people walking around talking to each other. Just faxes. So a lot less stuff is getting through as a consequence, and everything starts to break down. Some messages get through okay; other messages get distorted when the fax misprints or the paper jams; other messages don't get through at all.

The point is that even though autistic people have a normal-sized neocortex including normal-sized frontal lobes, our brains function as if our frontal lobes were either much smaller or not fully developed. Our brains function more like a child's brain or an animal's brain, but for different reasons.
When the different parts of the brain are relatively separate from each other and don't communicate well, you end up with simple, clear emotions due to compartmentalization. A child can be furious at his mom or dad one second, then completely forget about it the next, because being mad and being happy are separate states. A child hops from one to the other depending on the situation.

You see the exact same thing with animals. Strong emotions in animals are usually like a sudden thunderstorm, They blow in and then blow back out. Two dogs who live together in the same house can be snarling one second, then go back to being best friends the next. Normal people need a lot more time to get over an angry emotion, and even when a normal adult does get over a bad emotion he's made a lasting connection between the angry emotion and the person or situation that made him angry. When a normal person gets furiously angry with a person he loves, his brain hooks up anger and love and remembers it. Thanks to his highly developed frontal lobes, which connect everything up with everything else, his brain learns to have mixed emotions about that person or situation.

Also, not gonna lie, I did see your pup. It's been a dream of mine to work on an otterhound. Aren't there like less than 2,000 in the world? 

I got a chance to bathe a dandie dinmont terrier (coworker's dog... he carded the dog and shaped the head himself, he just needed help since he was swamped that day).

	<TEXT> I mean it is, I work in a grooming salon, people that don't exercise their dogs and have dogs with long nails, well, these dogs have a tendency to act up and feel uncomfortable with someone man handling their feet. I've seen it. My arms get scratched up from it.

Having a vet or a groomer grind your dogs nails is great. Especially since it's behind a wall/door/curtain and you don't know what's going on.

If you can't spend an hour with your dog a day, I can't fathom why you'd have a dog. Champion dogs cost $2,000-$3,000,000 (See chinese bred Tibetan Mastiffs). 

The benefits of long walks are numerous. Better behavior indoors, ample bonding, cardiovascular health for you and your dog, a great way to meet neighbors and other dogs in the neighborhood; I could go on. </TEXT>

I guess I say that because it's a nail grinder. Such as, "Hey Debra, yea we did the blueberry facial scrub and oatmeal shampoo, with medicated conditioner, expressed the anal glands, grinded the nails, and gave him a teddy bear head with a half inch on the body." It's a bad habit.

	<TEXT> For dew claws, bring them to the groomer. Sometimes they won't even charge you, it's so easy.

If you must do it at home, get a nail clipper [example](http://www.amazon.com/Safari-Professional-Large-Nail-Trimmer/dp/B0002ARQV4), and look at the dew claw closely. If you can see the quick, cut above it. If the nail curves, cut after the apex of the curve, the top of the curve, at a right angle (like 2:00 on a clock). If you cut the quik, don't panic. Use some Quik Stop to cauterize the cut, numb the slight pain, and stop the bleeding by holding on the area with the septic powder for 15-30 seconds. Though the professionals are always best! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yea, the reason I posted this tip originally was that a lot of dogs don't like their feet/paws/nails being man handled. It can be traumatic. I wouldn't say a barbershop and a grooming salon like the one i work in are analogous, because my clients don't speak the same language i do. Most don't know whats going on. Long walks and a little training (touching the paws often, using your cell phone on vibrate on the paws and body) can go a long way. </TEXT>

OC, California has a herding pen in... Santa Ana I believe with sheep. San Juan Capistrano has dog sleds for huskies. Tons of agility clubs all around the area. And the beach. For dogs like my lab that love to swim and surf.

But only some activities will wear down the nails. Walking/Running/Jogging will. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It can be for some dogs. If a groomer or vet in the past hit the quik (blood supply) it can resurface past emotions and freak them out. Also, their paws are central in feeling the world around them (Ever hear a dog can 'predict' an earthquake?). Myths aside, they are sensitive areas. I said this in the other post, about 5 in 15 dogs i see in a salon loss their shit. Long walks and a little training prevent that. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In a perfect world I completely agree!

Though when you groom dogs, and 5 out of the 15 dogs you groom in a day lose their shit when you trim their nails, I tell my clients to walk their dogs more! Bonding time, cardiovascular health (for both of you), better behaviors in the home; there's tons of benefits to wearing down your little pooch.

Some other tips, play with your dogs feet. Let them know you can touch them. Also, put your cell phone on vibrate and hold it to their paws and body. The buzzing will get them used to clippers and nail dremels. I've seen it work wonders. </TEXT>

Edit: What would I do if I could financially support a dog(s)? I would buy from a breeder, and make sure I had enough money to continue a blood line. But I'm a groomer, and plan on becoming a breeder. So... our needs differ. </TEXT>

See they wanted him suspended. Which is a bit ironic. As Burden's earlier pieces involved him doing physical harm to himself, such as his friend shooting him with a shot gun from 5 metres away.

Any who, Burden's opinion of his work evolved, and he got a great job at UCLA for decades. This incident happened, debatably inspired by his now previous work, and he and his partner ducked out. They wanted him suspended. The school balked. </TEXT>

She passed away while I was living with her. Amazing woman. Huge age gap (60 years), but I always considered her a friend. </TEXT>
