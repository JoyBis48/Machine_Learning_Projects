	<TEXT> I've never seen as many dirty blocks by one team as I have by the Niumatalolo led Navy teams. And I understand how the academies have to play, I don't have anything against that. It makes me prefer we didn't play them, but I don't hold it against them. My issue is that it seems like every year there's at least 1-2 plays like [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcTaRThg2mQ). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> [Baseball actually has much more parity than the NFL, in spite of the salary cap.](http://espn.go.com/mlb/blog/_/name/stark_jayson/id/8908029/mlb-more-parity-nfl) I won't try to make a direct comparison in terms of teams making the playoffs with the NBA, because it's too hard to compare a league where over half the teams make the playoffs, but 12 of the last 15 championships have been won by the Spurs, Lakers and Heat, with the 3 that weren't still having one of those 3 teams making the finals. The Heat also beat the Spurs in the finals last year, so it had 2 of those teams. The 15 years prior to that only had 5 different champions, which brings us to the beginning of the NBA's salary cap era. We've actually only had 7 champions in the 30 years of a salary cap. In comparison, MLB has had 19 in that same time span. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In fairness, tuition also has a lot more it has to pay for as well. In 1938, you had to pay for basically teachers, chalkboards, a few administrators, and people to take care of grounds and buildings. Now, you have to pay for all the technology, which also means you have to pay all the people take care of the technology. Not to mention all the other amenities that most colleges have now like gyms, more extensive health centers, higher quality food and housing, etc that costs more. Yes tuition is rising at an extremely high rate. But so is the cost of what is being provided for students. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I wouldn't put us as a top 3 job. The tradition is great, and depending on the recruit and/or their parents, the quality of education can be a huge boon. On the other hand, for a school with as much success as we've had, there's a lot of recruits we can't even attempt to go after, because they won't be able to get in. Not only that, we don't have any "athlete majors" where athletes can slack off and do nothing. Combine that with needing to recruit much more nationally, I still think it's a great job, probably top 10 or so, but not top 3 by any stretch. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Aside from all of our suspects being 6' tall white males with brown hair wearing grey hoodies, like everyone on campus, we had some great crimes (should be noted we have single sex dorms).

Guy was going through a girl's closet at 4 in the morning wearing nothing but a blue shirt.

A guy was exposing himself while on a bicycle, the logistics of which both confuse and impress me to this day.

Two girls woke up in the middle of the night to see a man in their dorm room. Upon them waking up, he left out the window. This was further explained to me by someone in their dorm, who told me they lived on the 2nd or 3rd floor. Apparently it went about 12 hours before it was reported, because they both assumed it was a dream. </TEXT>
