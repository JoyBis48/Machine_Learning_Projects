	<TEXT> The context is the population.

There are 112,374,333 people who live in the state in question, Maharashtra.

58,243,056 are men.

In 6 months, 1300 farmers have killed themselves.

" So in just six months this year, the farmer suicide toll has already touched 66% of the 1,981 cases recorded in the entire year of 2014."

Last year, 1981 farmers killed themselves in that state.

Yep, it's a problem.

That enough context for you?

	<TEXT> Good God, there are significant physical differences between men and women.

This is wrong and an embarrassment.

Wait until an adult decides they're really a 10 year old child and starts entering kids karate tournaments.
