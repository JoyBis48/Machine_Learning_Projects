	<TEXT> Hey guys this isn't a forever alone post or anything but i've recently went through a break-up and i have kind of figured out that i don't have a lot of friends and i want to make some more. now i know how to socialise i consider myself funny-ish and i'm pretty friendly and caring but  the problem i have is making the first move or putting myself in a position to meet more people. basically i want to meet more people with the hope of making friends. I don't know what hobbies i could pick up or what to do in order to meet more people. if it helps I'm 21 and live in the uk. thanks for the tips and if this question gets posted a lot I'm sorry. i didn't know where else to go.  </TEXT>
