	<TEXT> Contract length questions, Navy.

How do sea/shore duty rotations work? Rate I'm going in to is 36/36, so what if I have a month left at a sea command but six months left total in my contract, would I have to go to a new shore command for only five months and then separate or would i just finish out my contract at the current command?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Going in as AG soon as an E3, contract is for 4/4 years, my A school is only a three or four months long and there is possibility of going to C school at around the third year of service mark. My questions are: 

Do the 9 months of C school count for the 36 month shore duty tour?

If I attend the C school with only a year left in my contract how much would I need to extend?

How strict are the 36/36 sea/shore rotations? what if I'm at the 35th month of a rotation and my contract is up six months, do I get sent to a new command for the last months of my contract or do I just spend the end of my career at that last command?

I'm reading a book right now and came across this quote, felt fitting for most of us here in DEP or about to do something new: "Forget about what you are escaping from, reserve your anxiety for what you are escaping to" Michael Chabon "The Adventures of Kavalier and Clay" </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm in the halfway point between Miami Beach and the Florida Keys, a smallish city called Homestead. Only thing to see in homestead is the ghetto and then the mansions. Odd how there can be such a wide discrepancy in wealth just yards away from each other. Back when I was a pizza guy I would routine deliver to a run down apartment building and then a large mansion in a huge plot of land within only minutes of each other.


Honestly the only thing to do in Homestead is to hop on the turnpike and travel south or north. </TEXT>
