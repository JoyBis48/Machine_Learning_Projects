	<TEXT> During a routine inspection of Stag Arm's facilities in August, the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms   Explosives found a large cache of receivers  the part of the gun that houses the trigger and firing mechanism  without serial numbers, which is a violation of the National Firearms Act.

Stag Arms is owned by Mark Malkowski, who was a vocal advocate for the gunmaking industry when the state legislature and Gov. Dannel P. Malloy sought to pass tougher gun control laws in the wake of the Sandy Hook shooting. Stag manufactures guns out of two buildings on John Downey Drive in New Britain. The facilities are co-located with another gunmaker, Continental Machine Tool (CMT), which is owned by Malkowski's father, Tadeusz Malkowski. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Until we have federal laws in place, this is a fucktard comment. The officers shot in NYC were killed with guns from another state which has lax laws. Look farther than your nose, friend. You're being led by an arms dealer and are acting as a shill. _ </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Lincoln says authorities in Montezuma County, Colorado, were called after the two stole gasoline in Cortez. Investigators say shots were fired from the suspects' vehicle during the pursuit, hitting two law enforcement vehicles and the car of a vacationing couple from Germany.

Is this kind of thing reported on German news when people encounter gun violence in the US? </TEXT>
