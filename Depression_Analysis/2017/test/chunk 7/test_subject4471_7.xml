I've only started re-watching WWE in the last 1.5 years and there's not been any notable heels to me (Wyatt maybe, but he's more gimmicky), especially when I used to watch WWE as a kid back in the 2003-2007 era </TEXT>

When I want to try and connect with people I show them stuff ive made, such as 3D art or writing. There's a lot of really nice girls atmy college but they're so quiet and never talk about themselves. I feel almost nosy when I just walk over and start talking to them, like they give off this aroma kd "id rather be alone right now." </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2015-02-03 07:24:18 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT>  I heard some WEIRD and kinda DEVASTATING news about a pastor I know. Im in utter shock right now and all I can think of is: "WTF!?!!"

Later...

 The pastor, whom I mentioned above, 45 years ago, had a *sex change.*

Note the *italics.* Can you just *imagine* them talking like that in *real life*?

 Im not saying he isnt a *true* Christian...

I just *love* the italics.

 Im not saying its *wrong*, but its definitely *weird.*

[You can't make this up.](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/TrueChristian/comments/2uifj9/im_reeling_in_utter_shock/)

In the comments we discover that: 

 Said pastor has been forced to resign, and separate with his wife, if he ever wants to return to the church.

If you read this thread, you discover he was with his wife for a long time. It's a shame that one's *dirty little secret like being a homogay* got spilled and now has destroyed one's family.

The top comment speaks on the issue

 That said, I do believe that God wants us to represent the gender he gave us, no matter our feelings of identity. He knows better than us. (see Deuteronomy 22:5) If a pastor, or church member is caught up in this, he or she needs to be lovingly confronted according to the instructions for addressing sin with our brothers. And if they refuse to repent, then church discipline is in order.

I am glad some people start calling it out

 What was the point of this post?

And the very poignant

 He's a trans person, not a cannibal. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> OP you have never experienced the bad sides of relationships, so you cannot understand where people are coming from when they fear commitment. People like being in control of their lives and when that is slowly chipped away by obligations (yes, a bf/gf can feel like an obligation sometimes) they tend to run away or fall into a rut.

I love staying up late and working on various projects. If I had a girl there who wanted me to cuddle every night I would eventually go mental. I had to break up with a girl in college because she WOULD NOT LEAVE ME ALONE. I couldnt get homework done. I couldnt go out for a beer with just my male friends. She was so needy and a bit immature.

That is the fear of commitment. Giving up control. </TEXT>

Then imagine Christ, who does that every single time, no matter how low you get. He's always going to be there at the bottom to pick you back up.

I cannot lie and say there are no judgemental people, but we should recognize it is Christ who helps, not those people, thank God. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The article mentions *personal* questions, not fun nonsense you ask your mates when you're bored and it's almost last call. 

You should ask stuff like: who did you have your first kiss with? Where? When was the last time you cried?

I think the idea is you get to the *core* of a person's personality right away. Being with a complete stranger makes one start to sweat, you tense up. But then you're staring at each other, you can almost feel the body heat coming off the other person, so your hormones are starting to go wild. Now throw on very deep, personal questions that break into the core of someone's personality. The experiment breaks you down to your most vulnerable state, so you will naturally cling to the person you are with - or be entirely disgusted and retreat. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Most people on Reddit, well the game subreddits, are teenagers and early 20 yearolds with disposable income, ample free time and no other obligations than homework or maybe a part time job.

When these kids are literally being bombarded and absorbing content like trailers, opinions and games for hours a day, they get caught up in hype. Remember when you were 20 how "intelligent" you were? Then do you remember how fucking stupid most 20 year olds are with their money?

This and many other subreddits (e.g. pcmasterrace) have huge circlejerks around preorders, dlc and certain publishers...but time again these kids buy up all the shit anyways.

	<TEXT> The work I do is for myself because I enjoy doing it. Women do not motivate me. Friends do not motivate me. I motivate myself to improve. When a woman comes along I fancy, look at all this work and effort and skill I can show her; it makes her think I am confident, that I am working for myself and not to get laid like some desperate weirdo. She will see a man, alone and working hard, not a "nice" boy running after her. She doesnt want a nice boy. She wants a man who can take care of himself and therefore, likely take care of her too. She wants a man. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Drop little bits of yourself, or your skills, interests, etc. when talking with them. 

I'm in school for 3D modeling and when I see a girl (or guy, since I want to make friends too), working on a 3D model, I just go up, "Woah that's really good. How long did it take?" The common interest helps break the ice. As the conversation flows, I drop little bits about what I may be working on (currently a Juggernaut skin for Dota 2), or what my dream game project is.

But here's the catch: I am shit at modeling. I only started this class two weeks ago. 

After I have talked to them about the program for a bit, or what games they're playing, I usually ask for their Facebook or phone number (or both). I'm now in several of these small Facebook groups with upper year students comparing their work, and here I am, a complete noob, just listening and learning. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If that what you got you missed the point. At the beginning of the scene (bit hard to notice in that clip), the guys are all complaining about poor sales, shitty jobs, etc. They're being negative.

Then the Alec Baldwin salesman comes in and tells them to essentially man the fuck up and stop complaining - use that energy to close more sales. Stop being down on yourself "I was a salesman, its a touch racket..." and rather go out and do your job.

While the vid is specific to sales, the same mentality can be applied to anything in life. No one is going to hold your hand. "Nice guy? No one gives a shit." Stop complaining, get off your ass and fucking go change something about yourself.

As for dating? Every guy is a nice guy. Every guy can be reasonably attractive with some effort. The problem is the shitty attitudes that run amok on this subreddit. Attitude is everything. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Publishers ensure a few things like marketing, human resources, employee benefits, distribution for multiple platforms, international releases and not to mention the *funding for the next game.*

For every crowdfunded game like Minecraft or DayZ that does well, there are *hundreds* that don't even make it to Kickstarter. Go look at the Steam Early Access page and you will see just how much *crap* is on there.

A developer-publisher like CD Projekt have two divisions in their company. They have separate teams that work on marketing/distribution and then the actual game's development. An MBA doesn't know how to 3D model, nor does a concept artist know how to create an effective marketing campaign.

And you get 100% bet your ass that CD Projekt has outside investment (i.e. banks, investors) to help fund Witcher 3. Money doesn't just fall from the sky.

 Since when is it unfeasible to demand better service for our dollars?

It's not and I agree with you that we shouldn't have to put up with crap like uPlay, Origin or even Steam, all of which are DRM platforms (despite the pro-Valve circlejerk on Reddit). 

But you're giving all publishers the same brush stroke. You've become blinded by bad guys like Ubisoft and instead forget the hundreds of other [publishers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_video_game_publishers) out there that go completely under the radar. You know, the ones like Focus Interactive or Paradox Interactive, who just do their jobs.

And frankly I don't give a shit if Ubisoft releases a bad port every now and then. If they offered me a job to work in modelling or animation, you can sure bet I will work for them. They're a proven publisher with lots of money and job security, rather than doing the incredibly risky endeavour of starting one's own studio (especially when I have no formal experience yet). </TEXT>
