	<TEXT>  Do you really believe they were ESSENTIAL for his success?

Absolutely, I'm sure he'd say the same thing.  

That doesn't diminish he hard work or his investment.  Without a market for Telsa's cars, he fails, and without the California Zero-emission tax credits, Tesla isn't even profitable.  There are stories told of how close Tesla was to going under, I believe a couple of months from not being able to make payroll (read bankrupt.)  

Building PayPal is significantly easier than a car company, and the sale price of any internet-based company should be weighted carefully (How much did What's App sell for again?  Does anyone seriously think a mobile phone app was harder to develop that a car company? Luck  and a good idea is a huge part of the internet success, in fact luck is substantially under appreciated in business success.)

Here's a story for you to read: [Tesla Is No Success Story
Tesla is only profitable thanks to politics and tax subsidies.](http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/economic-intelligence/2013/06/03/teslas-success-is-the-result-of-political-favoritism)

Some quotes:

Tesla Motors, the California-based electric car start-up, has been the subject of a great deal of hype. With the recent news that it repaid its $465 million low-interest loan from the Department of Energy, it's now being heralded as a success story worthy of redeeming the failures of a green-energy subsidy program that has included the likes of Solyndra, Abound, Ener1, and Fisker Automotive. Since then, Tesla's stock value has more than doubled and the company is currently valued at around $12 billion.

and 

Even with the support of federal and state politicians, Tesla would still be reporting losses were it not for its ability to profit off of other auto manufacturers in California. In the first quarter of 2013, Tesla reported its first-ever quarterly profit by using special credits from California's Air Resources Board, which rewards auto manufacturers for the production of "zero-emission" vehicles. So far this year, Tesla was able to turn what would have been a $57 million loss into an $11 million gain by selling $68 million worth of these credits to other auto manufacturers in California.


Without a low-interest loan from the DOE, Tesla would have had some trouble getting started.  Sure he could have gone to venture capital, but they would have wanted a lot of control over the company, something Musk has been reported as being unwilling to give. </TEXT>

It is unlikely he would have made it without the government, so this is probably a case of a perfect counter example to the libertarian dream. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  put $1k towards a decent mortgage

Anyone who is making that much doesn't has a mortgage payment much higher that $1000, $2000 to $3000 for the mortgage is a lot more realistic. If you don't have a mortgage payment, you probably pay cash for an M4 anyway.  

That being said, you general analysis is correct, someone could in principle afford this, but it would be pretty dumb.  I believe most people who drive M cars lease them. (Assuming the majority of those with M cars aren't hobby racers.)  I suspect a majority of the people who drive them are business guys who want the appearance/status symbol. (that doesn't cheapen the car, just a society thing.)

The mercury found in tuna, however, is more than a vaccination ever was and **is** the dangerous kind, methylmercury.  It's presence is largely the result of humans burning coal which releases mercury into the environment. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> At the American Chemical Society Meeting in March, I was interviewed about the Science AMA Series.  This is the video the ACS staffers put together, I thought people would be interested in seeing it.  


Link to the video on youtube:

https://youtu.be/DwrRzxSSdW0

This is before a webinar I am giving covering science discussions on reddit:

http://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/events/upcoming-acs-webinars/digital-media.html

(I'll post a link to the webinar on the day of so that people can easily find it.)

Hopefully reddittors find this interesting and informative as to our motivations and values. (spoiler:  we're pro-science!)

	<TEXT> Thanks.  In /r/science, we have an unusual situation in that we have an incredible number of mods, 814 last count, which gives us a lot of internal review of mod actions without the drama of having a public mod log or anything like that.  Because /r/science is one of the most moderated subreddits we get a people who post thinking it's any old sub that they can make their shitty, off-topic, political comments in and get away with it.  They can't (and should not be able to, frankly.)

While we do have mods from many different back grounds, I assure you that we don't have a dramatic ideological bend beyond being pro-science, as in peer-reviewed science.  We aren't pushing any philosophical positions, mostly we try to keep them out.  That's why his comment was removed, he's making a glib comment that is pushing a personal position (which is seen in his previous comments.) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> He received a warning because of his history of bad comments, most of them have been removed for being overly hostile or political in nature.  It's not just this comment in isolation.  

Sorry that we don't feel like getting into arguments with hostile users looking to screen shot our conversations for grandstanding.

/r/science is not a free-speech subreddit, we have rules, we enforce those rules.

	<TEXT> He isn't banned, he's just not giving you the complete story, like leaving out the parts where he is reinstated and given a warning to make better comments in the future.  We issue short term bans to get people's attention, works doesn't it?

Not as drama filled that way is it?  

[Here's the real conversation](http://imgur.com/eYeAUpL)

Note the bit he left out at the end.

But by all means, don't let this interfere with your circlejerk and harassing messages. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Is there a way to re-title things to make it less of an issue?  We can't add anymore categories as we are at the character limit for the sidebar, so that's not an option.  

I created anthro as a separate sections because it tends to be more field work/lab work oriented than other fields in the social sciences, in particular Physical Anthro, which looks a lot like paleontology to the untrained observer.  Cultural Anthro and linguistics, sure, they could slot right into soc without issue.  

And honestly, from my experiences, aren't all anthropology people just functional alcoholics?  Would they even notice? :-D </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yup.  There isn't really an easy way to further break down the fields since people put their particular area, not a subfield in the text.  It would have to be done manually by someone familiar with the fields separating each out.  Some of them would be pretty hard to classify as well!  

For example, we have people with engineering degrees who work on computer programs to analyze biology.  So which field are they in? </TEXT>
