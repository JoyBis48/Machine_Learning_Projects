	<TEXT> I think that firstly, there should be a difference between promiscuity and genuinely being a *slut*, and that some criticism of proper sluts has some justification - but most importantly, should applied to MEN AS WELL.

It's fine with me for a person (regardless of gender) to go out and have a one night stand. I'm fine with two or maybe three different partners a week. Sex is great and should be encouraged. But someone who has sex with a different partner *every single day* (casually, not as a job etc) or even multiple partners in one twenty-four hour period (and I know girls who do this) are going a bit far. 

There are obvious reasons like the ridiculous risk of STDs with that many partners - protection isn't foolproof and you're vastly increasing your statistical chances - but, and this is probably where people will disagree, I think that having sex with *that many* different partners reduces the value of the emotional connection inherent in the act, and sex goes from positive to degrading. 

And I think some 'slut shaming' of men is fairly obvious - if women don't like being sexually objectified (and who would) and the way that affects them in society, then stop treating every one of them like an achievement, and your life like you have a pokedex of vaginas you need to complete. In short: men shouldn't be congratulated for having sex just because they were 'able' to get in a woman's pants.

Sure, I could probably steal stuff from a lot of shops. It shows I'm 'better' than the shop owner because he's not protecting his 'merchandise' effectively enough. So if I'm good enough to get hold of it then maybe I deserve it more than him. Doesn't change the fact that stealing is wrong.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's well-established that what women *think* they want and what they *actually* want are seldom the same thing.

Example: wanting men to open up emotionally in relationships. They think they want to hear about all your insecurities etc. But now you've lost all of the self-confidence that made you attractive to her in the first place, and before you know it, she's cheating on you or dumping you for someone else.  </TEXT>

There is definitely a correlation between the common opinion of a subreddit and its general demographic - for example, /r/sex features a LOT of very sex-positive women. This is great, but it provides a slightly biased view of women the world over (IMO), because someone who is ashamed of religiously disposed against their sexuality won't exactly be posting about it on the Internet.  </TEXT>
