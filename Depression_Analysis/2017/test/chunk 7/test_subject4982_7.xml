	<TEXT> I remember switching from private to public schools...private schools everyone had brand-new art supplies. Crayons, makers, pencils, pens... This one kid in particular came from a very under privileged family.. I noticed his crayons one day, seeing that they were old and had been used a while ago. I took the money out of my piggy-bank and bought him a new pack. At the age of 7. To this day I will never forget the smile on his face when he found/opened up that new box of crayons that randomly appeared in his desk.

	<TEXT> Most of us women at the age of 12. If I can recall one girl named Meredith- she had called me a cow and said I was possessed by the devil. So I threw a chalk board eraser at her head. We went to catholic schools. She got a sucker for the pain, I got scolded, detention and 4 wonderful weeks of counseling by our parish sisters.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What gets me about her sketches is that when there are creatures or other entities the way she describes them and the sketches totally freak me out. The one that I will never forget, this image has stuck with me for moths was of the creature that she claimed to be an evil spirit in someone's hallway. It was a black mass with a round shaped mouth. It looked like it would suck the life out of you. I've seen something similar before and it just really struck me as real.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I can see the eye. It blends right in like it belongs in the darkness. When I noticed it I felt a huge weight in my chest. 


I cannot say I am a professional psychic/medium but I do know I have abilities and many "professionals" have shared that same information with me. 

Try saging the house. All corners, door ways, every room including the attic. This can be done at any time, if you are more comfortable with the daylight do it then. Say something to bless the house and be rid of the spirits. Send them on their way to the actual afterlife. Another thing that I do whenever staying somewhere new, hotel, house, whatever- salt. Salt gets rid of negative energy. Windowsills, door ways and EVERY CORNER.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree with this whole 100%. My boyfriend is an AMAZING guy. He knows absolutely every way to please me, mentally, physically, emotionally. He's not as big as some of the other men I have dated prior to him but that doesn't bother me at all. He's so wonderful and good with everything else it truly isn't something I think about.  </TEXT>
