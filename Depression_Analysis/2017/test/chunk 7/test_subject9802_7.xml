	<TEXT> I do not... I'm actually asking reddit because I'm too ashamed to let my colleagues and my boyfriend know I need help. It's a psychological crutch; I was abused growing up and made to feel like I didn't deserve anyone's help and that it's shameful to admit you need it. I don't know why, but auctioning my art to strangers feels so much emotionally safer. I have a paypal account, but I don't even know how to set up a gofundme... Maybe I'm just being pathetic. I also unloaded a LOT of info on my thread and I don't want to inundate anyone any more than I already have... 

Thank you so much for your kind words, though. I've been struggling for months and now with the health issues, it's all kind of bubbled over.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> How flexible are your hours? You can always try volunteering on an organic farm in exchange for a free place to stay and three meals... The only thing is it depends on whether you can handle it. Most farms ask for 5 days/5 hour commitment... You can check out WOOFING (worldwide opportunities on organic farms) to see what might work for you! Otherwise, couchsurfing or air bnb may be good starts... Good luck :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> **Edit:** I feel like I've received enough kindness from the wonderful users of reddit to close this. Thank you to every kind person who donated, offered advice, kind words, or commissioned me. I'm currently working on art for all of the redditors who donated/comissioned. I will be PMing you all directly with a photo of the progress/finished piece and we'll work out how to get in in your hands directly!   

For anyone curious, [here is my art on tumblr](http://faunus-crypticus.tumblr.com). I'm always happy to take commissions or barter; just keep in mind I have about 4 out 5 paintings that need to be finished first, so it may take a few days - week before I can take on anything new.  

**Thanks again to everyone; I plan on paying it forward as often as I can in any way, shape or form. You all have touched me very profoundly with your kindness.  
- Shea** </TEXT>
