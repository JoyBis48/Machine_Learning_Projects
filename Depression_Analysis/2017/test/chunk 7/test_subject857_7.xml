	<TEXT> Kind of relevant, I worked in a place that served waffles for brunch, which we ran out of one day. Chef from head office happened to be there that day and what does he decide? 86 the waffles? Nope, he tells us to the store and buy fucking eggo waffles. We served 2 eggo waffles with blueberries and whipped cream for 12$. It really pissed me off. </TEXT>
