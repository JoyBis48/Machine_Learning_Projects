	<TEXT> On paper.    
   
This goes back to tricky Hollywood accounting. They doing it all the time. Heres a basic example of Hollywood Accounting: A studio makes a movie. The studio distributes the movie itself, and although the distributor is technically a separate company, they both belong to the same parent company. Also, the distribution arm sets whatever fees it wants. If they want to charge themselves eleventy quintillion dollars for distribution, they totally can. Then, even if the film earns billions of dollars in box office receipts, theyre still technically in debt (to themselves) and thus havent turned a profit.    
   
[That is btw the reason why David Prowse, the guy who was in the Darth Vader costume in the original trilogy of Star Wars has never been paid for Return of the Jedi because it hasnt turned a profit after nearly 30 years. Thats after dozens of home video and theatrical re-releases.](http://www.slashfilm.com/lucasfilm-tells-darth-vader-that-return-of-the-jedi-hasnt-made-a-profit) </TEXT>
