Look, dude, all I did was make an inane comment on a silly post on reddit. It's what I do on this site. I don't take it seriously like you do. Judging from your commenting history, you're nothing but a loser neckbeard who sits around on his computer all day. If you want to feel smart, get out of your house and make something of your life instead of trying to pick fights on the internet. </TEXT>
