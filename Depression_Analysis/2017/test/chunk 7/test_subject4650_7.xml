	<TEXT> My dad had a car accident at 16 in which he was thrown through the windscreen into a pool of burning petrol. He had no eyelids for a few months and his face ended up looking quite a lot like this guy's, minus the nose thing. 

He was in hospital for 18 months, and had time to come to terms with the fact that nobody was ever going to give him anything based on his looks. 

It turned out to be the making of him in a funny sort of way, he worked his arse off, married a fine gal and became a very successful guy. I've got a ton of respect for the way he carries himself and after the initial 'whoa' most people just forget it's there. He's never even bothered going back to get more plastic surgery to make it look nicer. 

Tough stage of life for it to happen but life goes on.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Chicago needs some kind of offensive system. I've only seen one full game recently - at the warriors - but the bulls hardly seemed to move the ball at all. One pass, maybe one screen, then iso Rose or Pau with zero off ball movement. Pau is great in the post but Rose was chucking up contested off balance jumpers all night - and it didn't look like he had a ton of other options.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Cheers for the kind words. This is no intermediate level bike, it's a monster. I'm gonna try to get hold of some of those 800cc Triumph triples, maybe a BMW F800 GS or a crossrunner. Til I've tried a few I can't really make a call. But they're all huge compared to a proper dirt bike - the KLR and DR650 are decent dirt focused compromises for road/trail touring.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't disagree with you - nobody wants to see my ugly mug. Unfortunately I don't always have time to go and make appropriate vision to cover every second of the voiceover, and a talking head makes for an easy edit. I've done plenty of others the way you've suggested but this time the bike was back before I had written the story. Sorry!  </TEXT>
