	<TEXT> What if she WAS the weird alien in TPS? What if the destroyer didnt kill her. It changed her and that's why you dont see any alien creatures in BL2 because the destroyer created them before it died. There are so many questions surrounding that character and no one seems to care about her! . I wanna know if she was the siren Lilth was searching for when she came to pandora, they share VERY similar tattoos so it's entirely possible. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah dude! Hence why i wanna know more about her! :D as for the hole in her, who's to know? Perhaps it was merely a robot. Her siren tattoos look more like circuitry/wires and she displays no siren ability when you fight her. Who's to say it was her at all and not just a robot? OOOOO CONSPIRACYYYYYYY! xD </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's because gamespy was shut down or something i think so if they didnt do it BL1 would have no multiplayer what so ever. It's nice that they did that, but it's something that should have happened a long time ago. Much like an FoV slider for the PC port :/ but hey cant really complain too much </TEXT>

	<TEXT> agreed BL1 had the best loot system. Even just opening chests was exciting there was a much greater chance of cool shit. In the other BL games it's always greens/whites in chests :/ </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Like what's her siren ability if she even was one? Like why did Atlas leave her on pandora? How did she rise to power? How did she even become involved in Atlas/the crimson lance? What if her siren ability is to heal herself and that the destroyer never really killed her? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> S S went out of business due to bandit guns being more successful. Also i agree with you BL2 weapons certainly have that feel to them but BL1 guns were simply more fun :/ </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't see why they restricted themselves so much after BL1 with these weapons types restricted so heavily by their manufacturer. Lets face it every torgue assault rifle is the same. Every Hyperion sniper rifle is the same and so on. 

We want innovation. We want to see Torgue sniper rifles and Jakobs rocket launchers and just generally more variety within all weapon types no? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Was anyone else hoping for some closure surrounding Commandant Helga Steele in TPS? I mean there's so much mystery surrounding that character and yet no one seems to want to know more about her. She hasn't been mentioned once since BL1. No echos. Nothing. </TEXT>
