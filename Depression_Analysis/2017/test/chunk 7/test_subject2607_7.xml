	<TEXT> In all honesty, I agree for the most part. I still don't use it because I know many people are still offended by it, and they have a right to be. A lot of people don't agree, and I think the n-word still has too much of a negative connotation to be used in a public setting like that, especially at school. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I definitely still think it's offensive and not appropriated but I realize that not everyone thinks that way. If you're going to use it, then it should be around friends that you know won't be offended, not a public place. I don't use it ever, but I'm trying to make my point that it's completely different in a public setting like that. I shouldn't even have said that it's  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think that it's okay to say around friends and people who you know will not be offended, but it's completely different once you display it in a public area like that. The banner reflected badly on the school and I personally think it should be common sense not to use a racial slur in a senior prank, especially one that is public like that. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Seriously? It's using the n-word and that word is offensive in any context. It doesn't matter if it's in a Drake song. It doesn't matter if they "didn't mean" it in a racially offensive way. It's a racial slur and it's not appropriate in any environment. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My mom. Had a borderline mentally abusive mother, and ended up dropping out of college because she couldn't afford it. Met her fair share of abusive guys before my dad. They had me then got divorced but still stayed best friends, even though he was in and out of jail, but then he passed away almost 3 years ago. So she had to raise me almost completely on her own since I was 2, and even though her life had all of these issues, she doesn't dwell on them and she devotes all her time and energy making sure we're happy and comfortable. She never gave up on me, and despite everything she's been through, she's a damn good mother, and I hope to be half the woman she is some day. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> But that's implied. It's the REASON for dress codes. A lot of schools don't enforce dress codes for boys like they do for girls. At mine, guys can have tank tops with the arm holes so big their nipples are showing, but a girl can't have a tank top with thin straps. As stated above, it is understandable if your ass or boobs are hanging out, but it's ridiculous to send girls home for things like thin straps or lots of thigh showing because it *distracts the poor boys* </TEXT>
