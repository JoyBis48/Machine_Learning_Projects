It just fascinates me how these people acted, dressed and danced, plus I could introduce my classmates to hardcore ;). As for the sounds, HARD KICKS! Doesn't matter what kind Hardcore, Subground, Early Rave, Hardstyle, Frenchcore, Hard House, Hard Trance, Terrorcore or Speedcore I'm down for it all! Another thing I love is how excepting everyone is, I'm friends with 4 of the 200 Ableton certified trainers out their in the world and while their all techno heads their always open to what I have to play </TEXT>

Put bags of rock salt around Woolie's place

Make Liam's body pillows come to life 

Rearrange Matts action figures when he isn't looking 

EDIT: I scrolled down and saw the stand thing, I would be a rotating stand! Every week I would change to a different user and I would have diffrent abilities! 

Pat: Help him control his anger and help him reach high places

Matt: Make it so he never drops things and give him the strength of the punisher

Woolie: Give him a salt cannon and make him not hate breakfast 

Liam: Help him overcome his fear of the booty and make his hair even more beautiful
