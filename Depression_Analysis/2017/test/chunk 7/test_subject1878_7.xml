	<TEXT> I don't post climate/env stuff on the weekends because the newsletters don't go out on the weekends. Back when they went out, I posted on the weekends. (I think you can see that in my old posts in /r/CHART_BOT but it might've been before that so no guarantees.) 

And if the trackers included my activity in private (karmawhore-only) subreddits where you trolly fanboys can't follow me, things would look a bit different...

Anyway, I'm off to the mermaid parade now, since it's practically in my back yard. Have fun chasing archie around in circles!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Whereas when you look at any group disputing climate change, 100% of the funding is from fossil fuel groups or dark money, aka nonprofit money laundering for the Kochs. And good luck finding their funding info, because they sure don't make it as easy to find as AAAS. 

(And a note, that funding was only for the "What We Know" project, not the AAAS as a whole.)  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well if you want to take that path, then it should be pretty obvious-who is more likely to be right, and who is more likely to be bought off, the group that consists of 97% of the scientists in the field, who get public grants for research (meaning they don't get to pocket the money) and who are delivering a message no one wants to hear in peer-reviewed journals for the past 100 years, or the group of just 3%, who get private funding from fossil fuel companies (meaning they do get to pocket money) and are delivering a message that fossil fuel companies want to put out, and whose work rarely appears in peer-reviewed journals and when they do are quickly and thoroughly debunked. 

So you can either believe that nearly every single one the world's climate scientists at every legitimate institution and every university have been bought, or that a small handful of scientists with otherwise dead-end careers have been bought.

That said, I'd recommend you take a look at the science. There are a number of fairly straightforward explainers from what should be credible sources- The A[merican Association for the Advancement of Science](http://whatweknow.aaas.org/), the group that puts out the #1 peer-reviewed journal, Science and is one of the oldest and most prestigious academic institutions ever is a good place to start. Then there's the [National Climate Assessment](http://nca2014.globalchange.gov/), which uses information and scientists from the various government scientific agencies, and was started by Bush to explain the state of climate science.  Then [there's the IPCC](http://ipcc.ch/), which is the international look at the state of the science, and has been approved by delegates from every country (including petrostates like Saudi Arabia. So even Saudis agree that what's there is the truth.)  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> lol, so you're blaming the fact that deniers circlejerk misleading Antarctic sea ice figures on the study authors. 

I bet deniers would also get questions about the rate of warming wrong. I also bet they'd get questions about how much warming is caused by man wrong too! 

But thanks for confirming that TP'ers/deniers come from a position of factual inaccuracy.  </TEXT>

Yeah, that's what I would've said too, Mr. Governator.  </TEXT>
