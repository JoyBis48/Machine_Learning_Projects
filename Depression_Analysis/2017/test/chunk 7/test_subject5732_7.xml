	<TEXT> And you are fucking asshole who don't respect someone's effort.
You are a kind of dick head who will be happy to see some fucking gifs and videos but will call an effort a spam.
But you don't have that much capability to make a thing you are shouting as spam.
FUCK YOU!
Your downvote will not matter to me.
But just learn to respect.
P.S This is not my website!
