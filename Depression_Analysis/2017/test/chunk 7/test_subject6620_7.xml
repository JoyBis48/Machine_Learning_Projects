	<TEXT> I suggest that you do some research about the year 1968. It was a huge turning point which led to years of many Black Chicagoans distrusting law-enforcement (among other things), and many White Chicagoans feeling unsafe in predominately Black neighborhoods. At the time these feelings were justifiable, but they've persisted for decades.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Do we really need to keep referring to Carcillo as an "enforcer?" Yes, Rosenbloom calls him an "agitator" in the article, and that is what Carcillo is. Yet I've seen a dozen articles since last weekend stating that the Hawks have brought back their "enforcer."

Is Carcillo really going to police play on the ice? If a John Scott-type boards one of our guys, what is he going to do about it other than make a bunch of noise and take an undisciplined penalty? 

From what I remember Carcillo's fights were usually retaliatory when he was here.

	<TITLE> A couple of educators looking to increase career potential. Does going back to school make sense? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-09-30 03:58:17 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hello, career gurus.

I'll try to make this as to-the-point as possible, but I apologize in advance if this turns into the Unabomber Manifesto.

My wife (age 27) and I (age 26) both work for the same company, but at different sites. We are reading specialists who work in the clinical setting; that's about as descriptive as I'm getting about the private company we work for. We both have had previous management roles in the company, but upon relocating to Chicago (my hometown/where my wife has decided that she wants to stay forever) we have limited opportunities for growth within our company, and have since taken pay cuts.

I have a teaching degree, but my only endorsement is in Social Studies; it has been way less fruitful trying to land a classroom position here in Chicago than my search in DC. (I got one on my first interview there).
My wife does not have a teaching certificate, but is going to get her Masters' in Special Ed and her IL License. She'll get a job in 2 years, not doubting that. I'm considering doing a 9 month program to get my endorsement to teach Special Ed as well. (We both have a number of years working with this population in the clinical setting).

Here's how the proposed Grad School costs break down:
Wife's Masters' Degree: $35k
My Endorsement: Probably $12k

I feel like my wife is a bit of a spontaneous person and not a planner like myself. I can't really see these costs making life too much easier at the moment. Especially if we are multiplying our debts 4 or 5 times.
I hate to say this to her, but I'm starting to think that when we move out of our nice $1300/mo apartment on the Northside this December that we won't be able to live in a place this nice for the next decade. (We won't be getting rich as teachers, but the expected salary would probably be about $48k with increases; that's about 15-20% more than what we make now)

With this outlook, should I focus on how going back to school may maximize our earning potential, and provide more for our future (a pension plus a 403b plan, rather than the 401k that our employer matches 10%) or is will this make us highly-qualified, yet broke educators?

Any thoughts appreciated.

Thanks! </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hello! I wanted to gain some perspective on the value of an LBS1 endorsement as a job candidate. I have an IL Type 09 certificate with a grade 6-12 designation and a focus in social studies. (...yes, only social studies...)

Would doing a 9 month endorsement program for LBS1 increase my chances of getting a classroom job next fall? Or, is a position as a Special Ed teacher really dependent on Special Ed licensure?

I have 3 years experience with students with special needs in the clinical setting.

Thanks in advance, and keep up the amazing work and dedication!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My wife would probably get a job in a few weeks after graduating. She's great at networking and communicating with professionals. In fact, there is a few schools that have already inquired about hiring her in the short amount of time she has decided to leave the company, but she's been inhibited by the fact that she doesn't have a teaching license. 

I'd have to work harder for sure, but my track record is good and getting an endorsement in Special Ed should help my chances. It's just that the Chicago area teaching job market is completely flooded with people like me, so the endorsement would hopefully set me apart. Part of me wants to explore the job market in other places (like her home state of Florida) where prospects seem better.  </TEXT>
