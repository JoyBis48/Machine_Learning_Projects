	<TEXT> Don't get me wrong the MCU has had some cool villains not great but cool. Loki was fun and entertaining to watch kinda reminds me of the joker a bit. Bucky was awesome too. But Fisk is just on anothr level entirely. Every time he was on screen I was legitmately scared for our heroes whic has never happened in the main MCU films because we know our hero will survive because hes got another movie out the following year. Now I really want Fisk to shows up in the new spider-man movie that would be amazing.  </TEXT>

If he is cut from AOU because of this I'm glad Joss isn't doing Infinity War he seems like a bit of a dick imo but im sure there's more to this than we publicly know.  </TEXT>

Ill dig up a story I still cant get over even years on

At my old repair shop job, we had a 27" iMac come in that the user said the DVD Drive stopped working, and it was out of warranty\user didint buy applecare so apple would not touch it

Some poking about later we ended up pulling a shitload of toast and crumbs out of the slotloader, we even tipped it up and shook it and such a large amount of crumbs came out after the chunks of toast we physically fished out left us stupefied, we instantly assumed the user had kids and the kids did kid things with the mac, and as a result the drive was toast (heh)

we told the user and he went all red and said "well, I uhh.. thought it was hungry"

"huh?"

"Yeah! Well recently its always been a bit slow when you turn it on in the mornings, like its tired or something, and I figured that I feel like crap until Ive had breakfast in the morning, and I have my breakfast at the computer desk so I thought it just needed a bit more energy, so I fed it toast!"

	<TITLE> [No Spoilers]With Amell being cast in TMNT2 Will this affect the schedule of season 4? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-04-06 02:18:05 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I've been thinking with Amell now cast in TMNT2 It'll be interesting to see how they will find time to film arrow. I mean unless Season 4 features very little of Oliver I cant see when they would film it if they still want season 4 to premiere in the fall this year. TMNT2 will be filming for at least 5 or 6 months that's not including the possibility of reshoots ether and Casey Jones is an important character in the TMNT story so its not like they can film less to accommodate Amell filming arrow other wise the story would suffer. I'm wondering if the addition of this new spin off show that features some characters from arrow is a way for the CW to fill the gap so at least the CW will have an alternative to Arrow if Arrow does need to take a break this year. Thoughts?
