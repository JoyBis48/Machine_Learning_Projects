	<TEXT> I lost 80 pounds in the span of a year in my 20's.

It was great, but the only downside was the extra floppy skin I had around my stomach. I looked like someone stuffed a pancake in a muffin tin.

Lots of hard work after losing that initial weight has helped out in that area, but it's still not as tight as I'd like it to be. </TEXT>
