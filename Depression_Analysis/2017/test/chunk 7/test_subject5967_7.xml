The A's aren't listed. The only answer can think of is that this was a spring training game, but I can't find stats for spring training from those years.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The thing about shower beer is people like to make it sound better than it really is. But, yes, you just take a shower like you normally would, but have a beer while you do it. I always find it takes me longer to finish a beer than it does to shower, so I'm left with a wet bottle. 5/10 </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Before each game, each team gives the referees 12 footballs. The Patriots use their 12 and the Colts use their 12, so each team uses different balls. An underinflated ball, while harder to throw a long ways, is easier to catch. It's easier to grip a ball that is underinflated and it will be less likely to bounce off of a receiver's pads.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's interesting. OP claims to be in the US, but he's written some things that no one from here would say. He called college 'university'. He called an apartment a 'flat'. And he said Jenny's SIM card came out of her iPhone when she dropped it. My money is on this story being fake and it sounds like OP may be British pretending to be American.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've heard people call this album a work of genius. I've heard it a couple times all the way through and, while it's a good album, I wouldn't call it outstanding. I'm curious what the rest of this subreddit thinks of it and can someone who loves it explain what makes it great to them?

	<TEXT> I LOVE Little Hurricane. Unfortunately, they remind me of other, more popular artists like the White Stripes or Black Keys and I haven't come across anyone lesser known who remind me of them. When I saw them live, the opening act was Lincoln Durham. He's not the same musically, but I bet you would appreciate his work.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is an outstanding comment. It's interesting that great movies like *Hotel Rwanda* and *Million Dollar Baby* aren't talked about as much as films like *Team America* and *Anchorman*, which are both, and I say this affectionately, stupid movies. 


Another interesting point you made is that children's movies seem to be talked about more. I think the question that neither you or OP asked is: Who is talking about these movies? Since most of Reddit tends to be in the 18-30 age range, it's not surprising that we still talk about the movies we liked when we were kids. *The Incredibles* still gets talked about, but is that because it's a great film or is it because we loved it when we were 12? My guess is that if Reddit had as many 30-40 year olds as it does 18-30 year olds, *The Incredibles* would not be mentioned as much as a film that that generation grew up with, *The Little Mermaid* for example. In 10 years, Redditors will probably talk about *Frozen* the same way we talk about *The Incredibles*.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This album was my introduction to Prince and after listening to it in its entirety, I wasn't impressed. I thought the vocals weren't loud enough and I couldn't make out what he was saying. But since it was the album that made Prince a star, I stuck with it and listened a few more times.


After a few listens, I fell in love with it. I live the catchiness, especially of the first two songs, *Dirty Mind* and *When you were Mine*, I love the thinly veiled (maybe blatant would be more accurate) sexual innuendo in the lyrics, and I even love Prince's high pitched vocals.  </TEXT>
