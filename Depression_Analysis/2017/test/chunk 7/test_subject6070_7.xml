About twice a month I would fall off backwards (5feet) and get the wind knocked out of me. I still can't explain how I always feel off of this thing. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I worked while I student taught and it was awful but it is possible. Do as much on the weekends for your job as possible because you will likely be too tired during the week. Let your mentor teacher know you are working . I also took out a small additional student loan so that I could cut back to 15 hours a week every other week which helped me not feel so burnt out. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I interviewed for jobs in Asia a couple years ago before taking a job in the states. a couple questions that were different from standard teacher interview questions  were how do you plan to adjust to culture shock? How would you handle language barriers with children? How long do you intend to stay in the country?  Everything else seemed pretty standard I was offered the job but decided to stay in the states. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not a sex Ed teacher but a high school teacher one of my students had heard that if you took ear wax from your ear and put it near a girls vagina that if she had an std she would pull away from it and if she didn't she wouldn't move. He wanted to know if this was true ...I asked him to repeat the question like three times because I couldn't believe how dumb it was. I informed him of the many ways to test for STDs and that was not one of them.  </TEXT>
