	<TITLE> Tried the cold pan pasta method today. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-03-14 19:13:13 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Living in a desert, I'm always interested in saving water and energy so I wanted to see if the cold pan method of cooking pasta would yield good results. I first learned about it from Chow.com, [here.](http://www.chow.com/food-news/94799/how-to-quickly-cook-pasta-in-a-frying-pan/) 

The danger of not using enough water is, of course, sticky pasta so for my first attempt I used whole wheat pasta which has less starch to begin with. I made one serving (3 oz. dry pasta) and used an 8" skillet. I broke the pasta to make sure it fit, which I don't mind. Purists may balk. I added enough water to cover it with a healthy amount to account for absorption and loss to vapor. It was probably around 3 cups (350 mL ?). 

It got to boiling pretty fast. [Here is a photo](http://i.imgur.com/s7H1WdL.jpg) of it cooking. I stopped short of al dente by a couple of minutes to drain and reserve the pasta water. I added my marinara and finished cooking, re-adding pasta water as necessary. 

The results were damn good. The sauce was thick and clingy and the pasta didn't stick. [Here's the finished dish](http://i.imgur.com/3TXfoUw.jpg) with some grated parmigiana and basil.

Edit:  In case anyone was curious, I ended up tossing away less than 2/3rd cup of water. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not really. Look at Google's design guidelines. Metro and Windows 8 began to popularize the flat design, with little use of gradients. Jony Ive took iOS in that direction. There are so many devices now. Apple's UI and Google's guidelines emphasize a very clean look with minimal distractions that work well across a lot of different screen sizes and resolutions. To me, the Windows 10 iconography stays within those design principles. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Here's a story of an expat who was beaten to death by customs officers for not paying the bribe.

*At Dhaka airport there is a gang of police and customs officers who supplement their pounds 80-a-month salaries by demanding between pounds 30 and pounds 50 from returning expatriates.*

*The general consensus, supported by a leaked CID crime report, is that Mr Miah was murdered, almost certainly by being beaten to death.*

*Humayen R Choudhury, the parliamentary speaker, doubted that the vast feudal pyramid of corruption could be breached, saying: "I know that people are treated very badly at Dhaka Airport, and we want to change that, but I imagine that you will come up against a brick wall when you want to talk to customs officers."*

[The Independent](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/death-at-the-airport-exposes-web-of-corruption-in-bangladesh-1308111.html)

In a country like that, anything can be accomplished at the right price. </TEXT>

*Kim Kwang-Jin, a former banker for the Pyongyang regime, said North Korea could have been moving the precious metal in an effort to find buyers.*

*North Korea often uses diplomats to carry cash and other valuables, defectors and diplomats say. Increased sanctions and scrutiny of official bank accounts have increased the need for secret movement of items in this way, they say.*

She brings two plates. One with the charcuterie, one with the cheese. In my continuing nave-ness I thought "hmm, why two plates," but didn't say anything. I realized when I got the bill that the meat   cheese plate was a meat plate and a cheese plate. $20 each.

It was delicious though. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> $1.4M is not really that much gold at todays prices. This guy was probably a courier for one or two high ranking government leaders and was just going to trade it for cash. Because of economic sanctions, North Korea has very little foreign cash. You need cash--like U.S. Dollars--to buy/import foreign goods. There are people who will sell you anything--Mercedes, Fendi purses (popular with the first lady), Armani suits--but they won't take the North Korean Won.

The reason why he got caught is because he didn't make any bribes or didn't bribe the right people at the airport. Arguing diplomatic immunity won't get you anywhere but if you slip enough money into your passport you could get almost anything through customs in a 3rd world country. </TEXT>

I had to take care of the arrangements. That took a lot of time so I wish somebody just helped take care of little stuff. Water the plants, walk the dog, etc. Keep your eyes out for that kind of stuff and offer.

Be honest. You can't imagine how it feels if it hasn't happened to you and it's OK to just say "I can't possibly imagine what you're going through." Any sentence that starts with "I wish" isn't going to be all that helpful.

It's a sad time but it's also OK to smile, laugh and even joke--"Your mom would not approve of that shirt for her funeral." Sometimes dark humor helps crack the tension. Again, you know your friend, I don't. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Unless you are being detained, the only thing you are required to give police is your name and any identification if they ask for it. You can refuse to answer any other questions and a refusal will never be used as any evidence of guilt in court. But you should always do so in a courteous manner or else you may give the police something to arrest you for.

That said, keep in mind that cops are just trying to do their jobs. Yes, I have heard the horror stories of some pretty big assholes in uniform too. But the vast majority just want to keep things under control. Sometimes they are responding to citizen calls about suspicious activity and they want to make sure that you're legit. They would probably appreciate clearing you quickly so they can move on to trying to find the actual person the caller was complaining about.

Even if you think the cop is overstepping his authority, you should comply but clearly state that you object to having to do it. The court will not allow any evidence gathered from an illegal search if it ever gets that far. </TEXT>

To answer OP's question:  Fresh spring rolls are made from softened rice paper, has fresh veggie ingredients and pre-cooked meats inside (shrimp or pork usually). Fresh spring rolls are not fried. On the other hand, fried spring rolls is ground meat and vegetables rolled in a special spring roll paper that fries up crispy and deep fried. A chinese egg roll -- I'm talking the crappy restaurant kind -- is usually some kind of meatless cabbage filling inside the same fried spring roll wrap, and it's deep fried as well. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The chemical structure of the different plastics isn't anything that nature has ever made so there are no organisms that consume it or can break it down and it doesn't rust or dissolve. Plastics, theoretically, last forever under normal circumstances and they never get recycled back into nature. Personally, I think we will eventually see the evolution of micro-organisms that can feed on plastics. It may take a million years though.

Petroleum itself isn't bad. It's the byproducts of combustion that is bad. CO2 in the atmosphere soaks heat instead of allowing it to dissipate into space, causing the Earth's surface temperatures to rise and altering the climate. Particulates like soot get into our lungs and are carcinogenic. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A reasonable doubt is when you're not convinced because there are other possible explanations that the prosecution could not effectively dismiss.

A trial generally goes like this:  The prosecutor has a theory and they show evidence to support that theory. Time lines, weapons, blood stains on the defendant, eyewitness testimony, etc. The defense attorney tries to introduce "reasonable doubt" about the most critical pieces of evidence. The defense doesn't have to come up with a competing theory though ideally it would be helpful if they could. The defense attorney will try to show that perhaps the eyewitness was too far away for a positive identification, or that the time line would be too difficult to accomplish. Basically, anything to have a majority of the jurors say "hmmm, maybe he didn't do it." </TEXT>

For wrongful convictions the defendant can always ask for processing and they can also employ an independent lab to process it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Most of the time it doesn't because the accused are known by the victim and there isn't any dispute that sexual intercourse took place. It comes down to consent/non-consent and processing a rape kit does not help resolve this dispute in any way whatsoever. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In most cases, the accused is known by the victim. Processing a rape kit isn't needed if the guy admits to having sex with the victim. The rape kit can only help resolve who the rapist was if the assailant is unknown or the accused disputes having sexual contact. It doesn't help in he said/she said cases and is just a waste of resources.

	<TEXT> I had one medical bill that was only partially paid due to a insurance screw up and it was on my credit report. I only found out about 5 years later (I don't apply for loans very often). I saw it on the report and called the collection agency to find out what it was. They told me who it originally was with (for some lab tests, if I recall). Funny thing is that after I called them, they started calling me and pestering me to pay the bill. I told them that I had insurance at the time and told them to take it up with them. This went on for months. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> And prior to the ACA law ("Obamacare") your chronic condition could prevent you from even getting insurance. Cancer survivors in remission were frequently turned down if/when they lost their job and their group insurance. And if you had a chronic medical problem and a potential employer found out, it does sometimes affect their decision whether to hire you because it will raise their insurance costs. This is especially true for small companies whose premiums can jump wildly if you get one or two employees who are big health care users. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hospitals also use this to maintain their tax-exempt status. Tax exempt hospitals "donate" about 1% to 2% of their services. They say "donate" but most of it is just uncollectible debt. But it's apparently enough to allow them to not have to pay taxes on their profits. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you had absolutely zero assets then maybe you won't have to pay. But if you had a house, maybe a little bit of savings, all of that could get wiped out since your bills would be sent to collections who would start legal proceedings on that debt. The only you'll have going for you is that debtors prisons have been outlawed.

In the UK you will get prescribed painkillers and post-surgical rehab treatment that helps you recover faster, makes sure you can get around your house or apartment, and stuff like walkers and shower chairs in case you have trouble standing up or walking. In the US if you don't have insurance you have to pay full price for your drugs, any needed equipment and people to help you rehab so you can get back to work.

The US is a totally backward barbarian society. But we're not the only ones. There's Rwanda, Uganda, El Salvador.... </TEXT>
