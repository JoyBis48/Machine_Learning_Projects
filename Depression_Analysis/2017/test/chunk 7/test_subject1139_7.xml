	<TEXT> Anime in general tend to be prudish about sex, it's not just isolated to female characters. The commenter also seems to heavily conflate sexual expressiveness with intellectual competency, as if one cannot occur without the other.

While most female leads aren't sexually expressive I think it's uncommon in modern anime that they're depicted as inferior and woefully incompetent compared to male counterparts. Of course the commenter will just dismiss that notion with a comment like this:

Obviously I'm painting very broad strokes, and no anime-watchers will struggle to produce counterexamples. Nevertheless, I think if they're honest with themselves, they'll see that anime generally sexualizes women by showing their virginal charm. Rarely is the female lead of anime world-wise or sexually-liberated. Westerners would accept that much more readily. But unfortunately, dojikko and emotionally stunted *-deres are 300x more common. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ema's story felt a bit rushed. I think this could have been better as a two episode arc. If the show is really going the Leon x Ema route, then two episodes would've been better for establishing that.

I wouldn't mind a Leon and Ema romance. Age difference don't bother me. It does feel a bit too immediate after Lara's death.

	<TEXT> The way the manga showed she was dying was so sudden that it took a while to process. It also took a while for Kousei to process what happened. The cat scene was both allegorical and reality slowly sinking in. I think it was perceptive of the author to let the readers go through similar emotions right along with Kousei. </TEXT>

Not even an ounce of jealousy from Yona. Hak has his work cut out for him.

Also if you want another fantasy show with a badass redheaded female MC, I really recommend **The Twelve Kingdoms**. It's a slower show and far more serious and darker. The character development is some the most gratifying in anime and the world building is detailed and expansive.

	<TEXT> Mostly agree with you. It's hard to get into the symbolism and surreal expression of ideas without an interesting narrative and engaging character drama. It almost feels like Ikuhara came up with the ideas and symbolisms first and then haphazardly attached a story and characters to them. In contrast to his other work, Utena, the characters were the heart of the show and the symbolism were built around them.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> While Maria is performing good deeds, Saint Micheal is partially right that heavenly or witch interference whenever something bad happens messes too much with the natural order of things. Although he's also in the extreme end by not doing anything. Like with most matters, moderation is key.

Maria tries to stop the war mostly for the selfish reason of hating it, which results in her not seeing the bigger picture.

So, Saint Micheal does have a point but he's just a dick about it. With that said you should all still convert to Wicca and worship thy Goddess Maria. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This episode definitely delivered the powerful emotions. Although, I was a bit disappointed with a couple of key moments that I was really looking forward to. The dialogue didn't quite deliver like the manga did in those two moments.

	<TEXT> One of the best anime shows ever. I'm not sure if this is the right way to describe it, but it's a mentally and emotionally demanding show.

Also, this was a spin-off of the bakeneko arc from Ayakashi: Samurai Horror Tales. I recommend watching that arc. </TEXT>

Ronja's voice actress delivered a great performance. Also, in dramatic scenes like this, phonetically animated lip syncing is a huge difference maker in terms of bringing the characters' emotions to life.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This episode left out a decent amount stuff from the manga. It was still nice but I would've preferred that it adapted most of the material since they're good. It also sped up the pace a bit and for shows like this I prefer a slower build up towards the big moments. Makes it more gratifying.

Perhaps they just changed the order of things. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sounds like this might be his third feature length film. I think his two feature length films (The Place Promised in Our Early Days and Children Who Chase Lost Voices) were his weaker works. His character writing is great and shorter films play to that strength but longer films require more storytelling which I think he struggles a bit with. For longer films having a co-writer might be of benefit, just like Hosoda had Satoko Okudera as a co-writer. </TEXT>

The Watari and Kousei dialogue was great and handled with a light touch that made it feel genuine. Kousei was in anguish but not super angsty. Watari was supportive but not pushy. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Melodrama is not inherently bad writing. It's just another tool at the writer's or director's disposal. Whether it turns out well or not depends on how it is used.

This subreddit has a habit of attaching negative connotation to tropes and cliche, which is lazy criticism and lacks critical thinking. What should be criticized is how the trope is used and not the trope itself.

	<TEXT> I think the whole substitute thing was just playful teasing by Kaori that Kousei sort of took to heart. I think even Watari realizes this, hence the scene when he asked Kaori if she likes Kousei and why he keeps encouraging him.

I also think Kaori, unlike Tsubaki, is fully aware of her feelings for Kousei. She just strikes me as a more honest character (to herself). But as you mentioned her terminal illness makes fully engaging difficult. </TEXT>
