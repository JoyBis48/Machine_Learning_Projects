	<TEXT> I'll be transferring from a 2 year to a 4 year soon and I'm wondering if the top universities are actually worth the cost. The only advice I've gotten so far is from 1 person and she has told me that I should go to a state school and then go to a top university for my post grad degrees. In my situation cost isn't that big of a deal.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So I'm stuck to sleep over at someone's house tonight. Was stuck last night too. Had to sleep on the floor. So my roommate and I were leaving work and he was driving, he didn't say anything about us going to his friend's house again. I was planning on taking a nice shower and making some BBQ chicken for dinner. So now I haven't eaten in several hours, I feel gross and Im exhausted. I also get to look forward to sleeping on the floor again tonight and possibly not eating until the morning. Also going to work in the same clothes, unshowered, teeth unbrushed and phone dead. I would've love to have at least been told that this would be happening tonight. I mean what the hell bro.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Small italian restaurant in Brooklyn </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-01-21 04:52:43 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Okay so I realize that this will be very tough to figure out considering the abundance of italian places in Brooklyn. I recently went on a trip to Brooklyn and we were taken to a very small and nice italian restaurant. Unfortunately I can't ask the person that took us to the place. So I'll try to narrow it down with the details I know of. Okay so the waitresses there all wore black and white stripes and had red bows or something around their neck. They served water in a tall green bottle. The menu was all in italian. It's also only a few blocks from the Barclays center and farther from the water than it. Now that's all I can think of. I'm really sorry. I can't even remember the name of the street it was on, normally I'm good at remembering names, but this slipped by mind.  </TEXT>
