	<TEXT> The only problem I have with these is that the small Fredlings are metal and seem to have endoskeletons while plushies are just plushies. The actually definition for a plushy is a soft toy so, yeah. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well it's not impossible some aren't prerecorded. I'm not positive about fnaf 2  but I think fnaf 1 is the only game that directly states they're pre recorded. And you not replying to them doesn't necessarily mean they're not talking to you live since in fnaf 3 the "Phone Dude" calls obviously aren't prerecorded since springtrap isn't present on night 1 of fnaf3. </TEXT>
