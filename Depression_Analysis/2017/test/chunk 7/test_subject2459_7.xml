	<TEXT> I like it. Then there's the issue of obscurity. The aldmeri dominion is the only "alliance" which remains after the interegnum. This is easily dismissed as it is known that the alliances fell apart when Talos took control but why were they never, ever mentioned in any lore book? Surely someone would have written about the pact or covenant. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I always here about full moons and new moons etc and yes the game does have a lunar cycle and from what I can tell it increases their chances of spawning but they can and do spawn no matter the moon phase. 

I am a werewolf and was bitten by an npc wolf the night after a new moon. I have seen countless wolves and blood fiends virtually every night. Lunar cycles don't matter! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Don't get me wrong I love eso and I love the entire series but zenimax did screw up some of the lore, sure they tried to explain it but the only people that buy it are those that have never played any other games in the series. 

If you played and completed Daggerfall then you will remember that there were multiple endings to the story, Bethesda made it so they all happened, technically. Using a dragon break they made it so it was possible that any of them could have happened. 


Any way Bethesda could use a dragon break to explain the faults in the lore in the next game.

	<TEXT> I am young but since I was younger than I can remember I always wanted to be a medical doctor. I was inspired by my doctors who I saw regularly because of asthma and my twins doctors as he has cerebral palsy (only slightly). 

Anyway I truly believed that's what I wanted untill only recently when I sat and really thought about where I was headed in life. I considered archaeology as history is my favorite subject and I could talk about it forever. Then I spoke with archaeologists and spent time in their company it was... enjoyable but not for me. Then it occurred to me - - history teacher. And I'm now working towards that goal.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> "There are many fates worse than death". This can also be said for murder and crimes. 

Take rape for example. Let's say a woman is raped she will likely have a very difficult time recovering from the physical and mental trauma and even then she will have a tough time getting intimate with someone. It can often ruin lives.

Then again look at child abuse-be it physical, mental or sexual. I read a book once about a young boy in the states. The name currently alludes me. I don't generally read these kinds of books but it came recommend to me by a family member and it was relatively short. 

It told the (true) story of a young boy who's mum started abusing him. He stressed how she and his father had once loved him and his brothers but the father began to drink and the mother began to abuse only him. She would beat him, starve him, force him to do things no person, let alone child should have to do. 

This is evil. To do this to anyone is wrong but child abuse is simply evil.

	<TEXT> Well they're special because they were playable in all past games but due to the storyline they're kind of different due to the fact that the three alliances are fighting for control over their land -- Cyrodiil.

As for you wanting to go to borrowings you will have to reach level 50. Since you chose the Daggerfall covenant you begin in their controlled area. At level ten you get cyrodiil and as you progress you get more of your own controlled land but at level 50 the entire Mao will become traversable. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey all, me and my friend play on the European server and would love some players to play with. We're both from scotland and are open to voice chat. Both of us have played plenty of elder scrolls in the past so we know the lore.


We play in the ebonheart pact. I am a female dark elf and he is a male nord. I mainly focus on magic (dark magic, daedric summoning and storm calling). He is a nightblade who focuses on close combat (siphoning, assassination and shadow). We would like a cleric of sorts but we honestly don't care what you play as or focus on we just want to have fun completing the dungeons and playing the game. Also we don't care what level you are.


If you want to play with us feel free to message me on Xbox:


Devlin Fr3w99


I hope some of you get in touch but if not I hope you have fun playing anyway. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi, I can give you a pretty great one, in my opinion anyway. I was a kid when I heard of this and it scared me for weeks but not so much anymore.

It's called: "Kuchisake Onna". It's an urban legend about a woman who's husband became increasingly jealous of her infidelity, he thought she was cheating. So he decided to take her beauty away from her by slitting her mouth from ear to ear giving her a permanent "smile", much like the joker in batman. He then killed her and she became a ghost.

I read about it in detail when I was younger it's kind of interesting.

I won't write the whole story but if you think it sounds good you can read it [here](http://creepypasta.wikia.com/wiki/Kuchisake-Onna) but that version is pretty short. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So I woke up and I never noticed immediately but my left I was pretty sore. Yesterday I got a very short headache (incase it's related). 

I can't stand up fast or move my head fast without pain. It's at the back of my eye and its pretty painful whenever I move too fast. It hurts the back of the eye and the top of my head. 

Also earlier I saw some parts of my eyesight as blurry, kind if hard to describe. I had to really focus to see certain things. For example look straight ahead then very slightly down and to the right. I couldn't see there. 

I haven't been to the opticians in a while but I'm going soon please tell me if this is serious. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I believe so. During the Scottish wars of independence William Wallace fought for our country (please don't take  everything you know of him from the movie braveheart as it is very historically inaccurate). Here he was considered a hero. He helped rid the country, temporarily, of English rule. However, in England he was considered a terrorist.



So to answer your question I think yes but it's very dependent. I do think it's rare however as most terrorists are unjustified and cruel but then again it depends on what you consider a terrorist.

	<TEXT> Not German but I've studied this in depth. Her answer will be better if they get a chance to answer you since there are so many comments.

Many people were against Jewish people even before the war, they were thought of as "the old enemy of Germany". Hitler, being a master of propaganda, used this hate for his own good. He made the Germans and anyone who opposed him look weak, greedy and selfish, only caring about themselves rather than the greater good of Germany.

Hitler was also very good to the German people. He provided free day trips and helped end poverty in Germany almost every person of age had a job of some sort. 

People never saw him as evil because he did things that were good for them and his speeches were very hypnotic, in a sense that he was a great speaker. You also have to remember that he came to power during a very tough time for Germany so they got on board with some of his more radical policies. 

Many people were ok with what was going on with the Jews because of their pre existing hatred for them and the propaganda that they couldn't escape. That's not to say some people weren't opposed to what was going on but speaking out was dangerous.

There are detailed cases of people being against Hitler's ways. One woman who's name alludes me made brochures of sorts and handed them out but she was only one woman and brochures took a long time to make. Communists were against him but like the Jews they were imprisoned and anyone else who had any doubts kept them mostly to themselves for fear for what would happen to them or their loved ones. 

If they wanted a peaceful life in Nazi Germany they wouldn't speak against anything. They would hail Hitler when they passed in the streets, they would have a copy of his book "mein kampf" on their table when they were having company and they would make sure their children attended the youth programmes put in place by Hitler. </TEXT>
