	<TEXT> I'm mad about the scene in the book. 

The thing is, that is the *worst* trilogy I've ever read. And I've read Twilight. The Hunger Games is a good book. Catching Fire and Mockingjay are both totally, absolutely abysmal. So some of that hatred bleeds over into the films. 

I'm not mad at the films. Catching Fire was a good film. I'm against splitting the third book in two because *it's absolutely fucking awful, and* nothing *happens*. So the third film wasn't the best. But I'm waiting to see what they do with the third one. They've maintained a fair level with the films so I think it's only fair of me to expect the finale to be not totally awful. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Titanfall had giant robots. COD might be doing better than it, but that's purely because the game already has a solid fanbase. Possibly (assuming here) made of pre-teens who don't really know a lot else about gaming so they stick to it. 

Team Fortress 2. That's a solid example of an FPS done right. I also quite liked Evolve. I know that isn't *quite* the same. But running around and hunting a giant monster is far better than running around and hoping you can start shooting someone before they start shooting you. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> AW is a touch better but is still at it's core: run around firing your gun. And...AW shifted the format a bit and they added verticality. But they were too late to the verticality game because Titanfall was all over that. So at it's core it's still COD just with a pinch of Titanfall, and a smidgen of the power-ups from Halo 3. Which...isn't enough. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If meat (red and white) forms a dietary staple, then...yeah. Need it to be kinda healthy. And sure you can replace it with pills, but those won't carry you through the same way.

It's not a matter of cooking. Well I should include pasta. I'll let you have that. I'm just not fond of veggies. 

I'm pretty sure that ethics is by its very definition without facts. Ethics and morals mean something entirely different for two different people. I mean, anything can aim to make a claim factual, that doesn't make it a genuine fact. I would on principle disagree with anyone or anything who tried to convince me I had to bend my beliefs to suit what they have decided. 

Are you implying we should be spoon fed our morals and ethical beliefs? Sure, some of what we take is given to us by our societies and we take that, we don't have a choice with that. Everything else we're pretty much left to decide for ourselves. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I mean, isn't meat pretty healthy. Not in vast quantities, and not processed. But aren't they dietary staples? Also, meat is the only thing that even tastes half decent.

Quantum physics(well, any science) /= ethics. My own opinions and ethics and morals I'm quite happy to decide by myself. And, just as a result of life, those things will change for me, that's just what happens. People I meet might change them, opinions are meant to be flexible. But at least I'm not being spoon fed everything I ought to decide by myself.

Don't worry, Withcer 3 is nothing like it.

The feel of Skyrim and TW3 are nothing alike. TW3 is much heavier, much more demanding. Both storywise and gameplay wise. But the worlds are equivalently epic and comparable. 

Just yeah...Get The Witcher 3. If you like high fantasy, especially TES, you'll love this. Also, you should play TW2, not to play TW3, just because it too is an awesome game. </TEXT>

I don't believe in God. 

I don't think that God is important as a figure that *exists*. But just as something to put your faith in. To give the feeling of something bigger than yourself, that exists outside of you. It's a comfort. And, even as an atheist, I think churches, mostly, are great things - when done right. Their the only real figure that promotes peace, love and charity on any scale, I think, societally, that's important.

	<TEXT> I came across something which is a great way of measuring classics. Which is to compare it to the things that were out when it was published. The Catcher in the Rye was the first of it's kind, and whilst I don't think it's aged well, it certainly is/was deserving of it's classic status.

But you've actually hit on the reasons why the book is a good one. 

 he spends the entire book whining about how his life and choices are all some one else's problem.

Because he doesn't want to face responsibility. He doesn't want be an adult, as he says; a phony.  He isn't, as a character, meant to have a redeeming feature. That is his character. And yeah, nowadays, it's not very interesting, but *that is his character.* He's stuck in a loop. Stuck between being a teen, and being an adult, that's why he wants to be *The Catcher in the Rye*. 

John Green explains it better. If you want to get anything out of the book, [watch this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R66eQLLOins) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Purists who've read every single comic book will never be happy with the film. 

People who dislike superhero films, and just pass them off as CGI-laden utter shit, will downvote them.

People who want to be hipster and dislike anything mainstream - yes, this actually happens - will downvote it.

It takes a certain kind of anything to be liked totally by the masses. Not even Harry Potter had the luxury of ensnaring *everybody*.  </TEXT>

My university lecturers said to get Final Draft as well, which, when a free version does the exact same job, to the exact same level, is ridiculous, and probably a touch elitist. These are the same people who also said to use FCPX over FCP7.

Yes, I use FCP as well, not Avid. I'll let you have that one. Avid really is the industry standard. </TEXT>

The channel is called: British Book Guy

Im British and it's a booktube channel. :)

Really it only needs to be simple, just the name in front of something british like the Union Jack or St. Georges Cross, with a cup of tea or something. Like I said, full creative control.

The recommended size is: 2560 x 1440

Apologies if this is unorthodox. And thanks either way :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The thing about astronomy is that I don't really see it is as anything much more than looking at tiny white dots, and remembering constellations. The only thing worth seeing with the naked eye is Andromeda. (Did you know you can see an entirely different galaxy with the naked eye? How goddamn awesome is that!?). I think there might be more to astronomy than that, but not for me. I like finding out new things, and finding out what quasars are, and what causes some stars to go supernova and some not to, and to see nebulae, and to compare our star to bigger stars, and our galaxy to other galaxies.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Whether or not the top starts to fall isn't important, because GET THIS:

*The top wasn't Cobbs totem*

This isn't my own theory, this is one from the internet...

The totem was his wedding ring. Now we know the Top was Mal's totem to begin with. But at the beginning of the film exposition-Arthur explained that anybody else knowing anything about a person's totem negates it. *But Mal is dead* you say? Well, she isn't. Not to Cobb. Who constantly sees her to the point she is the antagonist of the movie. The top being Cobbs totem totally negates it's existence.

But, for the shrewder ones among you, they will have noticed Cobbs ring. In the dream, he is wearing it. Outside of the dream, he isn't. In the ending scene, he isn't. The top doesn't decide it at all.

In fact Nolan has said that the top wobbling at the end isn't anything to do with the dream or not. It's to do with how little Cobb now gives a crap about the dream, the dream-world and his past life. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Just changed the strings on my Ukulele (questions) </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hey, so, first time I've ever changed strings (yay). I don't even wanna mention how long *that* took. But anyway...So from what I've heard the strings will keep on popping out of tune, and that's fine. At what kind of time will that *stop* happening? So if it continues for longer than it ought to I can probably but it down to the strings being buggared (my own fault).

Also, so the strings need to stretch. Should I give them a while to get used to being stretched, even a little bit? Should I wait until tomorrow to play on them? Or are they good to go - just be prepared to keep on tuning them?

Any other advice or tidbits I missed out which are important? Thanks guys. </TEXT>
