i use ctrl+T and start typing away.  
My New tab opens my about:newtab page. So i stay in the URL bar and can type away.  

And yes you can type keywords in URL Bar and it will search for what you entered with a search engine or previously accessed URL's </TEXT>

	<TEXT> ah im really not sure on this, maybe you've switched system themes or so?   
If im not wrong, its implemented by the OS so probably some theme is causing the trouble; orelse the only other possibility is that the CSS rendering is different for different browsers.

	<TEXT> in case your youtube is working fine then, i guess its okay.  

If you're still having problems its better to start off with a fresh new profile.  

Since you said webM is enabled on the youtube.com/html5 page, i thought it would be better to have a refresh/new profile created.  
WebM is still under development and as such you'll run into issues with video playback.  
You can disable it in about:config "media.mediasource.webm.enabled"  in case its still enabled.

https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/profile-manager-create-and-remove-firefox-profiles

Mostly likely the old browser which is based on firefox has left some settings enabled and that's causing all your troubles.

Marketing by advertisement will require some form of data without which no marketing will work.  
As long as Personal identity is not revealed or stolen, im fine with with being show products etc on my way based on things i find interesting.  
If i like something ill buy or else chuck it off.

Don't forget the HTitle extension for Firefox if that's your browser choice.  
Avoid the dark-theme mode in Fedora for some time.  Firefox is still improving on the gtk3 support. The light themes work fine! :)  

Free advice- try getting used to gnome without changing it at first. You'll love it. Incase you don't go for the Gnome extensions to suit your needs.  

And remember to improve the fonts with Freetype-freeworld package or Infinality.(Check prev. post's on /r/Fedora for more info)   </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  You seem to be more worried about price than freedom.

I'm worried on both instance.  

Kids today are hardly aware/taught that there are alternatives to proprietary software.  
A notion that choice exists isn't being propagated.  
Many are falling for marketing schemes. Its not just Microsoft.  
eg. Look at Chrome and the way the marketed themselves on the road towards domination.  
More people using an Android tied to Google than an untied version like CyanogenMod.  
Win-Intel systems in schools when kids should also be exposed to Linux, Mac's, Raspberry Pi's and Aurdino's.   

The illusion that it works makes it the best. Back in the old days you had to do some work to get things to work. Today not a bit. And its quite a knowledge black-hole when you don't know how things work in the background or the steps involved in making them work.   

Also the beauty of free software, that you can view code, contribute to the project(Artwork/code etc.) and use it as well, makes it a much better source of practical programming and a robust source to gain knowledge.  

On note of price - yes worried there too.  

* A RaspPi's is much more affordable and does pretty well for general computing purpose.   
* Open Hardware is the future as well.   
* Free(cost) software means people can use apps/software without being hindered by money. Not all of us can afford the license cost to install a legal Windows copy, a cost to install MS Office, a cost to install Photoshop etc. on top of the cost required to buy the hardware.   

Good things come at a good prices, some are worth the money! But if i end to empty my bank to type an essay in a word processor, then things become unfair.

Being taught that Microsoft Office is the best and only tool that can do word processing etc. And that the competition is useless.   
Children go home with the same mentality and are indirectly affected in buying paid software without being aware that there are amazing free alternatives like LibreOffice that do the same function at 0 cost.

	<TEXT> Affordability. Usability. Need.  

* I dont find the point in getting the high-end when a better high-end comes out the following year.  
* If a mid-range can work and do all that i need then why bother with a high end?  
* Plus all the high-ends have a huge price tag that makes it over-rated and inflated value.  
* Probably the only good thing on a higher end device to me would be the camera, but if you can spend so much on one why not get a DSLR?   
* Updates are still slow unless you are on a nexus.   

Doesn't justify the cost for me personally.  

Spending so much and getting outdated with a newer product in a years usage feels like a waste.   </TEXT>

Edit: 
Tried it out and i love it! It works fine as well as the gtk2 version for me.  
Looks pretty neat on Non-Dark GTK themes.   
Few Issues:  
 
* There are few readability issues on the Dark Theme versions(Numix; Adwaita) on GNOME like the drop down boxes on booking.com and initial loading of google.com shows the search bar as black before turning white.   

* I wish we could get rid of the BIG FAT title bar, but HTitle add-on is quite the savior. 

* And in "Get Add-ons" there is a big white space at the bottom

* Amazon tab keep stopping and showing the spinner every second before it completely loads.  

* Scroll bars disappears on booking.com drop down boxes while scrolling from bottom to top - Date; Month.  

Typed the edit on gtk 3 :D
