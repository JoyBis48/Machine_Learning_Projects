	<TEXT> Advice from just a kid maybe but, please listen to me on this; you need to take some time for yourself. Find someone that you trust to take care of your kids for a day or two, and go to the beach and just let the grief take you. Let it wash over you, let yourself experience it. Do what you have to do, cry, scream, break things - so long as you do not harm yourself (excessive drinking, drug use or self harm or probably not good ideas).

I guarantee allowing yourself a moment to truly take the loss will help you be stronger for your children. Because the last thing you ever want is to break in front of them, and take it out on them. I watched this happen with my ex-girlfriend's mother, and the effect it had on my ex-girlfriend was terrible and caused a few lasting issues between them.

Lastly. Take a breath. You can do this. You did childbirth, this is nothing. Stand tall and proud, and live the life that you know he would have wanted you to have. You are strong, and everyone here is rooting for you. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Is there some scientific reason that your memory becomes so muddled from those dark periods? I have legitimately lost close to 6 months of my life because the only thing I can recall from that period is the crushing darkness that I constantly felt. There have been entire events, parties, even my own birthday, that I have absolutely zero recollection of. </TEXT>

For those that didn't know him it may have seemed inappropriate but those that were close to him knew that ACDC was his favorite band and he wouldn't have expected anything less. My exgf also showed up in a bright pink and yellow dress and got me to wear a brightly colored belt. We got some looks from people but fuck them, it was a celebration of his life and he was never a serious man. He would have been so proud of her. :)

	<TEXT> iMessage works exactly the way as Hangouts works now, it just threads iMessages and SMSes in the same thread *on the device*. When you send an iMessage (blue) that message is viewable on any iDevice, including computers running OSX - this is because it is sent over the data network, through Apple's servers. If you disable data on an iOS device and send a message to someone, it will send as an SMS (green) and is *only* viewable on two devices - the device that sent it, and the one that received it.

To reiterate: **iMessage on OSX cannot send or receive normal SMS** - messages sent and received on the desktop are iMessages. With this understanding, Hangouts is already operating exactly the same way, and matches iMessage in functionality on the desktop - that is, messages sent and received on Hangouts are viewable on any device where you have access to your Google account.

edit: in reply to your statement about the Verizon messaging app - the reason this works is because, either way, Verizon handles your message. Your phone will send your message to Verizon over the GSM network and then Verizon will either: 

a) send it directly to the appropriate # (if the # is also on the Verizon network)

b) send it to the relevant carrier, who will then send it to the device

Because they are handling your message *anyway*, you can send and receive SMS on Verizon's website, and because they can match your account info with your #, it sends as your number. The way Google voice works is that you send your message to them over *data*, and then they send it from a # that *they* own (but is uniquely given to you as per their service) to the relevant carrier. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This has been asked numerous times in this sub. **You will never see this happen.** For this to work, Google would need to send every single SMS you send and receive to their servers and then serve it up in Google hangouts on the desktop - meaning that you would have to have a constant data connection for it to work, and SMS sent and received may appear in a different order on the desktop Hangouts than they do on your phone (unless the Android version of hangouts syncs with Google's servers, meaning that Google would get your SMS before you could even read it). There is no graceful or efficient way to do this, *unless* they do it in a Google-voice-esque way; which again would end up only working in the US and would require you to change numbers. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I had a long-term relationship with a girl who was molested as a child (6 or 7 I think) by a close friend of her father's. I was quite shy so strangely enough all the sexual stuff usually initiated from her end. The first time she gave me a blowjob she went into a state of shock... I'm not talking just upset but like PTSD flashbacks sort of shit, she was shaking and it was like she was unable to see or hear me at all. I sorta just held her on the floor and kept saying "It's ok. It's ok." over and over again. One of the scariest things I've ever experienced and I would never have understood what was going on if she hadn't shared what had happened to her with me just a few weeks prior. 

There were a few more episodes like this whenever we tried anything sexual but we just took things slow and I made sure she was 100% comfortable. After a while she was pretty fine with anything and in the later years of our relationship she was quite a minx in bed.

Unfortunately we're not together anymore but I'm glad I got to help her through that little speedbump so now she can have a healthy sex life.

edit: thanks to whoever gave me gold. To everyone saying what a good guy I am, it's really not as amazing as it seems. I had a girl on my hands who was willing to push through extreme childhood trauma to ensure that *I* was satisfied (both sexually and in our relationship). Staying with her and working through it was an easy decision. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Are you talking about an OTA update or for when the ROM scene reaches 4.4?

If the former, you have to do the following steps:

* Flash stock recovery
* Flash latest stock ROM (if you are not already on it)

An OTA update will remove root and overwrite your radio (assuming there is a new one) so you will lose root and LTE.

If the latter:

* Nothing - When you flash a 4.4 based ROM you will have to wipe data though, so you may want to ensure you have some sort of backup. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Rule of thumb is to never dirty flash between Android builds. In fact, the only time it is ever not a bad idea to dirty flash is updates to the same ROM. 

So: 
Android version change - clean flash

ROM change (even if same Android version) - clean flash

Update to newer version of same ROM (but same Android version) - dirty flash </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Wow. As someone that was on the opposite side of this exact situation, can I just say that there is a very real chance that she was just as confused about what was happening as you and your friends were. Depression is a HELL of a disorder and when it gets really bad it can warp your reality to an insane degree. I hit a really low point in high school and as a result, I systematically destroyed every single meaningful relationship I had... No bridge was left unburned. You do this because you are so determined for the reality inside your head to match the one in the world around you, it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. Honestly I look back on that time and I couldn't explain half of my actions, your brain operates on an entirely different level. And I think your friend would feel the same way. Thanks for keeping in contact with her. I managed to reconnect with a lot of old friends when I started getting better and it meant the world to me that they stuck around.  </TEXT>

Source on this? Google is still actively developing AOSP. Calendar and Keyboard have both been released on the Play Store and their respective AOSP versions are still updated to the latest with every release of AOSP. It's just a way of Google getting a close to stock experience on any phone with access to the Play Store. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I posted in the flash Friday thread last week but it can't hurt to share again, in case anyone missed it.

**ROM Name:** Slim Bean

**ROM Version:** 4.3 Build 1 (09/15)

**Android Version:** 4.3

**Download Link:** [slimroms.net](http://www.slimroms.net/index.php/downloads)

**Kernel:** Slim-4.3-JWR-RC-1.1 (default ROM kernel)

**General Feedback:** I initially tried this ROM because it was one of the few ROMs that had a JWR+JSS hybrid kernel - I was on CM 10.2 nightlies w/ Franco kernel and I kept running into the JSS deadlock issue. I initially intended it to be a temporary thing but after running this ROM for a few days, there is nothing I miss from CM (read: SlimBean has all of CM's features) but I would certainly miss some features of this ROM if I went back, so it looks like I'll be staying for the foreseeable future.

**Hardware Comments:** Nothing really comes to mind... there have been no bumps in the road in terms of hardware issues, which is to be expected from a Nexus device.

**Features:** All of CM's features + way more (and their ROM size is somehow ~100mb smaller than the average CM release!). My favourite have been the way they handle custom navigation buttons/layouts (the UI/options for it are better than CM's implementation IMO, plus you can do things like have custom actions done on long-press of a button, which as far as I'm aware of, isn't available on CM) and transparent navbar and notification bar on the homescreen (which results in a simply beautiful [homescreen](http://i.imgur.com/c49K0Tk.jpg)). There are just so many more options for things, and it doesn't at all seem bloated.

**Stability  amp; Performance:** Both have been absolutely stellar on the stable release. On CM10.2 I was experiencing daily random reboots and keyboard freezes due to bugs in the JSS AOSP build - granted I was running a nightly of CM compared to a stable release, but CM only has nightlies for Android 4.3 ATM and I wanted to be on the latest. It just seems lighter overall.

**Caveats  amp; Warnings:** Honestly, at this stage, absolutely none. I've been gushing about this ROM to all my friends (well, those who know what a custom ROM is) ever since I installed it. I have only been running it for 3 or 4 days though, so there may be some hidden bug that I have yet to discover. </TEXT>
