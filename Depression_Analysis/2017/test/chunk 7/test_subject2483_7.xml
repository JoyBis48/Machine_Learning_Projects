	<TEXT> Thanks for the answer! Quick question:

Can I get in trouble for things that 'those individuals' have agreed to. If they agree 'I understand I may lose all my money', and then I they try to sue me for losing their money, will I get in trouble? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks for the great answer. Exactly what I was looking for. I have two questions:

1) In how much trouble will I get into if I don't do anything (assuming that this remains a small thing and I don't have anyone go and sue me).

2) Can I get in trouble for things that the other parties have agreed to. If they agree 'I understand I may lose all my money', and then I they try to sue me for losing their money, will I get in trouble?

3) What are the chances I even get caught if this remains a small side thing with no 'lose all the money'? 

PS. I consider myself a value investor (risk averse, long term), not a trader (speculation, high risk, potential for huge mistakes). </TEXT>

Friends would because they have nothing better to spend it on, and many actually do have faith in me (whether they should or not is not for me to decide). I must stress again that this is not a massive mutual fund that I am starting, just a small side thing. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey r/legaladvice

I hope I am clear enough. If I fail to do so, please tell me so. I will keep it short. 

I am a 17 year old and I invest (shares and bonds). I live in Paris, France. My question is a more legal one. I am interested in selling 'shares' of my portfolio, which would allow my 'partners' in the to see their investment grow and fall in par with my capital gains/losses. The people I want to join are simply friends and family who would be interested. I don't plan to make this a big thing, but I am still curious whether this is legal or not, and whether this entails me to any risks if I fail (I plan on providing a document on this). 
Simultaneously, I do not want to register anything if possible. My goal of doing this is to increase the amount of capital to widen my options so I can invest in more securities. I am not planning to do so until I feel more comfortable and knowledgeable investing.

TLDR;
I invest. I want other people to give me money. Their capital will track my portfolio (eg. my value +10%, their money invested rises +10%). They become minority owners of my portfolio, owning 'shares' of my portfolio/vehicle. They can sell the 'shares' to me or other 'partners' and earn/lose the difference. They have voting rights to the investment decision using their 'shares'. They sign document agreeing to all of this AND that they understand they may lose all the money.

ANSWER: After reading every single comment, many of them of very high quality, which I thank you for, I have been convinced that this is a bad idea for many reasons which merely appeared good to my young naive self. I will continue to invest and will allow people to loan me out money, but not in the way described above. I will however consider this in a year or two when I (hopefully) will be in uni in (hopefully) London, hopefully (hopefully) in LSE, where I will be able to have more opportunities open. For detailed reasons of my decision, read this great thread for those interested. Thank you so much ladies and gentlemen! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Personally, I am 17 years old and am preparing to embark into investing with around 1000 euros in start-up capital.

I know that time is my friend and in the long term I should be fine, but I am just worried about the significantly reduced compound growth I will expect if I lose a signficiant part of my capital in the beginning of my investment carrier. For example, if I lose 25% early on, all my future earnings will be significantly lower than what I could have had (around 25% less). I put emphasis on this because I am just going to start investing now.

If my reasoning/logic is wrong, please tell me more. I do not believe I am right, it is just what seems to me.

PS. And thanks for responding so quickly. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey there,

Being a 17 year old beginner, my analysis of firms is based on the 'teachings' from the II, which I have built upon (hopefully improved)*. I now assess firms on many different quantitative and qualitative metrics, but still based on the II. 

However, I feel like there is a gaping hole in my assessment as I make no reference or use of cash flow. Throughout the II, cash flow is barely mentioned (and mostly in comments by Mr. Zweig). 

However, I believe it is important. I am currently researching about its use to answer my question, but I would love it if you could please tell me how and why it is necessary to analyse it, and how one ought to do so.

	<TITLE> Lets discuss: Should one (start to) invest now, or is the market overvalued? </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hey r/investment!
I am sure many of you here have an opinion on this question, so why not make a thread where we discuss this. 

Is the market* overvalued compared to underlying metrics? If time in the market is more important than timing the market, does it still make sense to invest at these all time highs? Should one wait for a correction?

It would be nice if you could state you answer with some explanation (or links to explanation). 

I believe this is very important for many beginners to know, as well as a great way for seasoned investors to help out with.

PS. I am aware this is the million dollar question and it is foolish to ask it, and even more foolish to expect a concrete answer to it, so keep in mind the point of this post is just to hear out some opinions of what people think, not make forecasts or predictions. 

*By market I refer to stock markets generally. I guess more specifically it would be the US and European markets. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In my humble (and often wrong) opinion, I believe the veto is not meant to be beneficial, but is meant to allow the great powers* to have checks and balances, so that no one power is too powerful. And I believe that by not allowing any nation too much power / making compromise and dialogue effective, leads to more benefits to the entire world in the long term. It also gives the incentive to large nations to want to remain in the UN (eg. USSR in the 1950s). Look at the league of nations to see what happens when one power/one side is too powerful. 

However, as you've mentioned, this has lead to numerous local mishaps at best, genocides at worst. Try looking at the bigger picture. Hope my answer helped, tell me if im wrong. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> More than helps! Thanks so much!
I realised (sadly) that companies have gotten into debt to pay higher dividends/buybacks. My question is, what is a high payout ratio in these current times? Should standard be lowered due to the low interest rates (what would that be?), or should they be heightened to prepare for (a long awaited/potential/maybe not) rise in interest rates? What do you consider to be good, satisfactory, bad and terrible payout ratios?

Thanks again :) </TEXT>
