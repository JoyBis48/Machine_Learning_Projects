	<TEXT> So everytime I import my images to my computer, these albums (the ones with the dates on its names) appear in my iPhone. I really need to remove them, for they are starting to make huge space in my HD. How do I do it? When I am on those albums in my iPhone, there is no erase button, but I can visualize the images.

iPhone 4s, sorry for bad english  </TEXT>
