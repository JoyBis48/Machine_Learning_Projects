	<TITLE> Summer Sale coming up and I'm locked out of my account. Should I just off myself? </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Long story short; I thought my account might have been at risk at a point so I decided to lock it (Huge mistake). I've been waiting four or five days now for Steam Support to reply but no answer. I've never had to use Steam Support before so I really didn't know what I was in for. Now the Summer Sale is almost here and my account is forbidden from purchasing games. Just came here to grieve. Perhaps someone could give me some hope with their Steam Support stories? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Paranoia? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> I've been smoking for around 7 or 8 years now. As of the past three years, I've been a heavy smoker. I used to be fine. Relaxed, giddy, aware, etc. Now I just get too tired too quickly and paranoid on top of that. Paranoid that people are watching me or judging me or something. It's pretty shitty cause I would always smoke to relax my mind but now it's doing the opposite. Any opinions on this? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If I had the option, I'd remove the bars on the windows too. I don't think this is a very good comparison. But obviously enough people like multiple monitors enough that they don't mind the bars. I'd hate them, I would rather have a single screen and nothing getting in the way. </TEXT>
