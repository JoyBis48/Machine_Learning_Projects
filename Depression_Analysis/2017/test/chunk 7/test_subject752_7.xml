	<TEXT> I'm *not* arguing about their website, I'm not arguing about their content, I'm arguing (or rather pointing out) that the standards of their reporters' headlines has plummeted.

For starters, "missus" is a really colloquial term I would not have thought any decent editor would be happy to present to the public on a national news website. 

The sentence as a whole is something I would expect an 15 year old to write on his Facebook! 

I mean can you look me in the eye and tell me that it doesn't come across as rather childish and unfitting of a national news provider? </TEXT>

The point of an implosion isn't to remove any material as people seem to think, it's merely a tool (when used correctly) to make it easier to deconstruct the building further. 

From a demolition point if view that implosion was fantastic!

	<TEXT> To be fair: "we have to compete against cheap supermarket beer, let's look at reducing our prices" said no beer owner ever. 

You're not the first person to suggest bar owners shouldn't charge so fucking much for a drink, to be fair they're utterly the victims of their own demise, uni students etc just can't afford $15 for a 1.3 standard drink Smirnoff or whatever (and that was prequake prices..) So seriously, instead of changing with the times (more low alcohol beer, more food options, cheaper/better priced alcohol) they just whine, and bitch and complain how the world's against them. 

The other argument I get told is "well there wasn't a reduction in bad behavior when the closing times were changed a while back" and it's like you diving kidding me?

You stupid cunts that should have led to a change in behavior before shit got worse. 

Utterly no sympathy. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Try using sports mode more often. 
If in doubt, use the flash. 
Always turn on your lights in the room (if indoors)

Your device will default to around 1/33 second (a third of a second) to take the lowest possible iso photograph. Sports mode speeds this up to around half a second, which is better than nothing. 
Source of my info: s4 owner for a year, s5 current owner. 

Both have no OIS (optical image stabilization) which means your hand has to stay dead still for around half a second! So you learn to make to do without it. 

If you legitimately have trouble holding your camera still for a third of a second then I would strongly advise you look at OIS for your next device.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So as the header suggests, what would it need to employ a system wide spiral motion to zoom in and out of everything from websites to documents etc. 

I had this functionality on my Nokia N900, it made one handed usage unlike anything else since. 

This would replace/supplement "pinch to zoom" as that inherently requires 2 hands, which (with today's 5 inch plus devices) is not always possible! 

Anyway, any idea how this could be implemented, or is it a pipe dream to every see it back?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I really would not trust some randoms working at a gas station, especially if they were going to just "pop it into the till" where it would be forgotten about and become beer money when till was counted. All it would take if they forgot to tell the next shift about it, it would have been quickly and easily forgotten. 

This way he turned a forgettable event "oh, didn't that guy hand in 50 bucks last night?" Into "oh that wanker the other day, yeah he took the money"

Ironically this probably helped the staff recall the event, also ensured other shift workers knew about the money and ensure it got back to the old lady.  </TEXT>

Read up: www.consumeraffairs.govt.nz/for-consumers/law/consumer-guarantees-act

Let them know from the outset what your expectations are, whether it be a new phone, refund or what. You have given then their "chance" to remedy the situation, now it's your turn to say "I want x." 

Follow up, agree on a time frame, ask for the escalation path as to who you should talk to, e.g. 
"if this isn't sorted I a week, please let me know the name of your regional manager or other such person I can escalate this to."

If you get your matter resolved, follow up, thank them for helping you (if they did..).

Do NOT bad them on social media, just keep it offline. If this goes as far as the small claims they will dig dirt on you if they can.  </TEXT>

However swearing at, and making presumptuous comments at people who aren't blaming the media seem at odds with your angry anti media sentiment. 

As proven time after time this kind of violence needs to addressed by very citizens it affects the most, the sons, daughters, husbands and wives if those murdered need to tackle the problem head on, and bring the crime rate down together. The culture of blaming others needs to stop if they're ever to reach a satisfactory outcome (of a more peaceful crime free neighbourhood). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Why is that ageist? No benefits for people my age are not means tested, in fact many are stonkingly hard to acquire, and aren't worth it.

For the record, here's the table for the amount of money you get [for being being on the pension](http://www.workandincome.govt.nz/map/deskfile/nz-superannuation-and-veterans-pension-tables/new-zealand-superannuation-and-veterans-pension-ra.html)

We pay more to our old people than we do to a [single parent](http://www.workandincome.govt.nz/map/deskfile/main-benefits-rates/sole-parent-support-current.html)

[Or to people looking for a job.](http://www.workandincome.govt.nz/map/deskfile/main-benefits-rates/jobseeker-support-current.htm)

And if you do work until you're 65, even on a meagre salary you don't get any support at all.

So yes, it's absolutely ageist, we pay our old people regardless of..

* How much they've worked,
* How little they've worked, 
* Whether they're still working, 
* How much money they own or have in the bank, 
* What assets they have, 
* How many dependents they have..
* Whether they're in the country
*Or ANY of the prerequisites required of the younger generations.

So yes, applying no rules for 1 age bracket, and every rule under the sun for every other age bracket is extremely ageist. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Going to unleash a shit storm here, but seriously: Means test superannuation.

No seriously, let's look at the biggest 'arguments' and show why it's a fucking cop-out.


**"They've paid tax their entire life."**

* For starters, this doesn't apply to immigrants.
* Paying tax isn't a fucking retirement nest egg plan, it's called playing life.

**"Why should you punish those who have saved for their retirement?"**

* You're not punishing them, they're punishing the future generation by taking from their future retirement who can't afford it, because you fucked the economy.
* Why? Seriously, they listened, they saved, they were never guaranteed a wee bonus for living a long time.

**Let look at a few facts:**

* **We can't afford to keep paying Superannuation at the current rate.**
* As a 27 year old who's the sole breadwinner for their family the government has decided I can't get any assistance or even the fucking community services card, despite the fact we're barely holding our head above water by eating into savings.
* My generation basically cannot hope to have superannuation. Certainly not at 65, probably not even 70 years old. 

So there, fuck your guaranteed money for being old. I'm sick of this ageist culture. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Indeed. But increasing the price without offering any incentive should be business suicide.

However they made $137M profit 2013, and $165M profit in 2014. and $92.5M profit in the 6 months up til December 2014, so this year is expected again bumper profits.

I'm not saying a company can't make profits, obviously that's ultimately what they're there for. But in the same breath a consumer only has appetite for a certain amount of cost, and Sky are pushing that further and further every year to see how far they can go before it blows up in their face. 

That to me seems like an obscenely arrogant way to push up profit at the cost of losing customers. 

Seems like someone has analyzed the NZ public, and has done the math as to what they think Sky can get away with at each incremental charge increase.

Given their profit's only going up and up in substantial amounts it appears that this is done purely for greed sake, as they haven't released anything recently to justify the price increase..

I don't know, I'm not a business analyst, but I'm not stupid, so I can see why, (Profit) I just think it's wrong. (Greed.) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Actually this makes sense. Here's why:

* Smaller die fabrication could result in less power consumption, thus less heat production, and increased thermal envelope.
* The average useage scenario for most people is short bursts of activity, so having 4x high performance cores that are available for short bursts makes sense for ensuring UI responsiveness, quick camera processing.
* The 2x medium performance cores which are available for sustained constant useage (think gaming etc.)
* And your 4x low power cores for your fitness tracking, background thumbnail and media processing etc.

As the 810 works for short periods, having something use 50milliwatt for 10milliseconds is preferable than something that uses 40milliwatts for 20milliseconds.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Actually it makes sense, all phones have a thermal envelope to play with. 
Either you can have a 1ghz dual core that can operate at 100% constantly and never hit it..

Or..

You can have a 4ghz Octocore which hits it in 15 seconds.

Now, as you've pointed out, most people don't need their processor working all the time at 100% However most people do want NO LAG, and INSTANTANEOUS response time. This needs immediate grunt on tap.

So where as your dualcore can respond within 150ms at all times
Your Octocore can respond with 10ms for your 15 seconds until you hit your thermal envelope.

Obviously people want a faster response time, over sustained performance, so will go for your Octocore.

Not a lot, the biggest impact will be to farmers.

To your average Jo Bloggs in NZ it will mean bigger more noticable storms, more dry, warm drought ridden spells, coupled with higher winds. (Think Christchurch norwesters.)

To your farmers? It will spell bankruptcy for many, especially dairy farmers, which is typically quite water intensive.

We'll also see produce prices rise, as more foul weather will result in bad crops. </TEXT>

My very rough understanding of the law is take into account all the actions, all the facts, without prejudice or feelings.
Heavily coming into this is it's the child's mother. We wouldn't be having this discussion if it were another relative.

As I keep saying, as far as the law's concerned, this baby was killed by a mothers negligence. 

There's an entirely innocent victim here, and while it's beyond heartbreaking for the mother I feel the weight of the act that was carried out needs to conveyed with a different sentence than discharged without conviction.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm going to be downvoted here, but this woman isn't a victim, her child is.

For everyone asking for a discharge without conviction can we at least recognise the severe and extreme pain that poor child would have been in before they died?

The simple fact here is a baby, whose entire existence is dependent upon their family, died due to her mothers inattention. 
Regardless of culpability this victim suffered before she died horribly, and her sentence needs to reflect that.

To allow her to get away with this with a discharge without conviction is not recognising the extreme pain this baby suffered due to her negligence.  </TEXT>
