	<TEXT>  I'm afraid I'll turn into a hambeast.

Also my biggest fear.

But no one is telling you to eat 3,000 calories for the rest of your life. No one is telling you your calories have to come from unhealthy foods. You can own your recovery, get to a healthy weight, and restore your metabolism the best on 2,500+.

I believe you'd still gain on 2,000, but I think PinkPanther4 (if you're reading this nice job on recovery!) had some trouble gaining on around that once her metabolism started speeding up. </TEXT>
