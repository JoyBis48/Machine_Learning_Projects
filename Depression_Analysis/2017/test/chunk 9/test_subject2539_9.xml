	<DATE> 2015-04-19 02:50:27 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Nope. I say: 90 percent of the firsts gross.

Reasons: I dont think it will be good, the trailers them selves dont scream "must watch" if anything, people are watching just because they've seen the eight other marvel films.

The first one made a lot of money.

A lot.

Many things had to go right for it to go like that, and I dont see those same things happening again.

One thing that might prove me wrong, there's no competition. Mad Max ain't doing shit to Avengers, so it will have some time to gross freely.
