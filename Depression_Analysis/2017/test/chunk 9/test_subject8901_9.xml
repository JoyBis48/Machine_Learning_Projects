	<TITLE> How does the human body correct an imbalance if it is too acidic or too alkaline? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-06-30 00:06:45 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Someone recently told me about how an alkaline diet can help prevent cancer. I'm far from being a dietician or a scientist, so my understanding of the subject isn't that great; however, I did a cursory Google search and it provided a lot of information to quickly debunk the whole alkaline diet as a means of cancer prevention. Anyway, I guess what I'm looking for is an explanation as to how the body becomes too acidic or alkaline through diet in the first place, and how it corrects the problem. Also, what are the implications, if any, of having an overly acidic or alkaline body. Are there any cases of people having a disorder where the body is unable to correct an imbalance?  
  
Thanks in advance, guys and gals! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Came to this sub by accident because I hit the "random" button, saw this post, and was really saddened by your situation. I don't usually give advice, but here goes.
  
Be yourself, OP. Don't try to be someone else by mimicking what you think is "normal" behaviour. Do your best to fit in if that's what you feel will make you happy, but don't feel like you have to put on an act for others for them to like you; you'll never be happy as long as you're acting your way through life. I don't have Asperger's Syndrome, but I know others that do have it, and I never once expected them to "act normal." It's a disability that people should understand and respect. Your family should be giving you the support you need, not acting like there's something wrong with you.  
  
Have you met with a counsellor? If your family have been as unsupportive as your post suggests, perhaps you should find one have have your immediate family members meet with them too.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Where are these neckbeards getting their IQ scores from? Seriously, though, there's no way so many people on reddit are scoring 150 and higher. Something like 0.1% of the population has an IQ higher than 145, so I'm disinclined to believe anyone that tells me they have a "higher than average IQ." It's usually the least intelligent or most narcissistic who believe they're smarter than everyone else. </TEXT>
