	<TITLE> Anyone know this exercise? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> My trainer came up with a routine I can do while I'm traveling and don't have access to a gym. One of them is titled as a dumbbell burpee and the instructions are to row on each arm, push up, and then lunge on each leg. 

I don't remember doing this since I was super tired the day we went through this workout. I'd rather not bother my trainer at this time since its late. 

Anyone know what exercise this is? I'm at a loss of exactly how I should be performing it. Google isn't any help. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think it was my first grade teacher. She was really pretty and really nice. She went on maternity leave before school was out. I still kind of remember her all these years.   First girl crush that I was completely aware of was on this girl in high school. She knew I liked her because I told her. Anyway, she married a guy and they have a kid now. I feel weird whenever I see her now because I turn into that awkward and shy 16 year old all over again. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was 10, too. I was playing in front of my house when I was catcalled by a guy driving by in a car. I was too busy playing to pay attention. The only reason I remember it at all was because my 14 year old brother came storming out of the house, chasing the car, and yelling at the guy. </TEXT>
