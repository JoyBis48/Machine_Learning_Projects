I liken it to a wheel-lock bar in a car, sure they're disabled by accomplished thieves easily - but why would they try when there's a car beside it that has none.

	<TEXT> I don't know for sure.

There's as much concern as to patents, seed ownership, cross-breeding rights, corporate monopolies on essentials etc. as there is to GMOs themselves.

As for the genetic modification side, I'm inclined to think they're safe.

Though then I remember about 15 years ago, a group scientists declared sections of our DNA 'junk' that had built up over the aeons of evolution. This became a widely held viewpoint, but then about 5 years later - the view changed to the 'junk' being part of epigenetic transmission from one generation to the next. So very much not 'junk'.

That all made me think that genetic modification is perhaps still to young a scientific endeavour for anyone to say for sure at this stage.

Plus, I think it's often a solution looking for a problem.

We produce more food than we need, we bin so much of it, we use land inefficiently - all the while there are many techniques for growing plants in hostile environments, soil remediation, the city farm in Japan that's producing huge quantities of food with drastically lower water requirements. All these things without a GMO in sight, and thus none of the legal ownerships concerns.

I think the medical / environmental concerns can take a back-seat to the reality that we really don't need them.

	<TEXT> Tnaiste: Officials in my dept should be complimented for looking to make appropriate arrangements for water grant

One of the many things that really annoys me about Irish politics is this fishing-for-compliments for people doing their jobs, or often demanding praise for it.

They get paid to do their jobs (which isn't done well frequently), it is not the product of volunteers.

The highest number of patients on trolleys only just a couple of weeks ago, a nurse's strike - all a confidence problem?

	<TEXT> Very viable :)

I use a Pi as my main stereo, hidden away inside an old radio cabinet.

I use [Rune Audio](http://www.runeaudio.com/forum/) as MPD server, plus it comes with a nice UI for control from phones, tablets, pcs ...

Two things to note though:

The sound from the Pi is not great unless you add a DAC (it's really hissy without it) so I don't consider a DAC optional for this kind of setup. I went with a [Wolfson Audio DAC](http://www.element14.com/community/community/raspberry-pi/raspberry-pi-accessories/wolfson_pi), it's designed for the Pi and Rune Audio has built-in settings for it.

The other thing is large collections. I had a much easier time after splittling my collection into folders of just less than 10,000 songs each. Scanning, and quick playback was much better then.

The sound is glorious   clear. And for the price, I reckon impossible to beat.

What galls me is that while government wants more   finer grained data on citizens - the same government wants less   lower quality information known about it.

This is a pity as it would greatly assist citizens with sanctioning under-performers, removing government waste, evaluation and of course making informed decisions when voting.

I'll be happy to give the government more data, when I don't have to pull their teeth to get more information about them.

Until then, I'll give my votes to people less data-grabby. </TEXT>

Because the Israeli Embassy in Ireland has a long history of inappropriate tweets and facebook posts which antagonise a lot of Irish people, and the embassy routinely has to delete the posts afterwards and apologise.

They've been doing this for years.

So I guess one must ask, why does Israel tolerate having these ambassadors represent them? </TEXT>

That only ~25 people have left Ireland to fight in Syria, or 0.07% of muslims in Ireland have done so - fits that idea.

It would be great that that tiny group didn't, but I don't think making policies for such outliers / edge cases is ever going to stop something which is part   parcel of human nature. However much we wish it weren't.

Plus, the very good news is that 99.93% do not.

	<TEXT> Steam will get a big boost, showing off their steam machines and controllers over the year.

Console-only gamers will be very tempted to cross over after a mediocre and limited 2014, seeking the greater variety of games available via Steam, GOG etc.

Ubisoft will learn nothing, as they don't have to, their games sell anyway.

Though 2015 will probably be a bumper year for second-hand sales, as the lemons of 2014 get dumped into the stores by the end of this month.

By the end of 2015, Ubisoft will finally be in trouble for their QA issues after the Division sells next to no DLC. At least one of their divisions will be fully closed.

Nevertheless, 2015 will be much less salty. Adventure games will grow in popularity and books will become more of a primary source than movies. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There's not much I can help you with there, sorry.

Though, just on the simple process side of things:

I had it enabled on both pi's but when adding sources there is nothing under the UPnP option.

There should be nothing at that point, not directory type lists or files.

For the 'just in case' , repeat the step till you get to that same point and then press 'left' on the remote or 'c' if you've a keyboard and if a dialog box appears then press 'enter' / 'ok' / 'select' / 'scan for content' or click your mouse.

I know it sounds simple, but it's how some of the menu actions work.

From a technical standpoint, what you're looking for is the norm for me and most of my friends - it's very doable.

Also, I use the 'quartz' skin - so if you haven't changed them yet, I'd swap over to that for the Pi, it's light   quick. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Were you able to connect to 'UPnP (Auto Discover)' using add sources?

It comes up when you choose UPnP at the add sources stage but don't choose anything after - just it, and then it will be listed as a source. Click on that and any UPnP will show up, you should be able to connect from there. Both R-Pi's will need the 'connect via UPnP' and similar options ticked, of course.

Anyway, that's only one method. Plus UPnP won't get you posters, plotlines and other metadata - network shares will.

The better methods would be using SAMBA or NFS network shares. First way to do that is possibly your home router, if it's reasonably new it should have a NAS or 'File Sharing' option. Enable that on the router, plug the hard-drive into it and then back to your Pi. This time you'll be adding sources via the 'Windows Network (Samba)' or 'Network Share (NFS)' option and if the router's done it's job, you'll find all your folders in there and select them as you would in the same way as if it was a connected hard-drive.

If the router can't help you there, then you'd need a home-server. So that's typically an unused PC / laptop, or something like the Pi (though usually not super fast enough) or Odroid U3, it's not a massive piece of work - but a bit longer than a reddit comment. There are loads of guides online, but the quickest solution is with your router if it has such a function. So try that first. </TEXT>
