	<TEXT> I've argued with people about the "less water you use, the stronger the shot" ideology. It just doesn't make any sense. A quarter g in 10 units of water is going to make you just as high as a quarter g in 100 units of water. The amount of water you use can't possibly make a shot stronger or weaker, less water doesn't equal more dope. The only explanation as to why it may seem like it makes it stronger to some people (not me) is because 10 units of water injects faster than 100 units of water, therefore the quarter g hits you harder, since it's hitting you in a much shorter time span.

 So this may be logical for some people who have trouble shooting, you know the ones.... after 7 minutes and 5 different holes in their body, they finally get the whole thing pushed in, split into thirds between injection sites lol. 

However, I believe it is a bad idea for those people to only use 10 units of water, because time is not on their side, their rigs start to clot up with blood and the less water they start out with, the faster their shit is fucked. 

It's actually funny, my friend (who's an anny cook) sat there and tried convincing me that less water means a stronger shot. You would think a cook would understand why it's not true. Although, this is the same guy that calls pseudoephedrine "pseudophetamine" and thinks that MSM has methamphetamine in it because the first "M" in MSM stands for "meth". 

He was actually the baddest anny cook around, though. Just goes to show you how simple the shit really is to make, any retard can do it. Lol. He just had the technique down is all. He couldn't actually tell you why the reactions happened the way they did, or what was happening, all he could tell you was that you were gonna dry heave when you jammed it in your arm... and he was right. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As other people said, kratom will help tremendously.

I've been through a lot of treatment programs, and they always tell you to never attempt to quit things like smoking or coffee or fatty foods in the beginning of your recovery. It makes sense. Everybody has a vice, you're concentrating on eliminating your benzo use which is far more important than any of your other problems right now. After you get a little sobriety under your belt, then may be a good time to look at your other addictions.

	<TEXT> My old lady just had a new engine installed in her car. Ever since then, it stutters. It'll do it going up hills mostly, when trying to accelerate, but it does it here and there on flat land too. I did some research, saw some stuff about catalytic converter and whatnot, I've basically ruled everything other than the engine itself out because it didn't do this at all before the new engine. My best guess so far is the EGR valve? The check engine light comes on here and there, especially when it's happening, but it goes back off. Thanks in advance. </TEXT>
