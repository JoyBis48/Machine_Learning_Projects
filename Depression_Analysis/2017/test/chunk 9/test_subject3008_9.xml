	<TEXT> I was in a dessert wasteland type place. Nothing around for miles. It's during the day and the sun is out on a cloudless day. I'm just wandering around aimlessly. Suddenly, I start to hover about two feet off the ground. All I can think is "wow, this is neat". So I just continue to wander around aimlessly but now I'm also floating. Now everything is suddenly dark but not like night time dark but like bad storm clouds dark. I'm now paralyzed. After a few seconds I'm moving but I'm not in control. I'm turned around after hearing a child's voice scream "Help me!" The voice sounded very distant, though it was two feet behind me. Directly behind me is a set of prison bars that only appear about six bars wide but I knew it would be impossible to get around. behind these bars is the child that screamed. He doesn't have eye balls, just sockets. He screams again and that scream sounds distant again. Then I start to scream a high pitched wail like a higher pitch than I can accomplish while awake. I do this scream in my dream and for real to the point it wakes up my wife. It's like a ghostly sound. I have a lot of dreams like this. The surroundings are slightly different but the base idea is the same. I'm floating around and suddenly I can't control where I go and there is always a kid trapped somewhere screaming for help then I scream. My wife wakes me up and then I can't sleep for a couple hours. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'll tell you what my parents taught me. Every morning look in the mirror. If you're satisfied with what you're looking at, you've failed. What I mean is deeper than appearance. Are you better at your job/classes? Are you a better you than yesterday? Have you improved in any little way since yesterday? If you don't think you've improved yourself in twenty four hours, you aren't trying hard enough. Everyone struggles with something everyday. You'll never be perfect at anything but you still must be great at something. Don't worry how good Joe down the road is at x, just focus on how well you are at xyz. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Stop acting as though just because we're never going to know the pain of childbirth that any pain we do experience isn't pain. Getting kicked in the nuts doesn't hurt any less just because we'll never give birth. It still hurts like Hell. Saying stuff like "well, it's not like you pushed a human out of yourself" belittles our pain like that changes things. "At least you don't have to have periods". Just in case you were wondering, yes my pain is still just as painful. I'm still just as sore. It still Fucking hurts. I've never insinuated that getting kicked in the nuts is the same as child birth or periods. That's because my pain is exclusively a man's pain as your pain is exclusively a woman's pain. Neither gender will know the other's pain. Stop talking down what men go through. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> 2004 Chrysler Sebring 2.4 liter coolant issue </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-05-07 05:26:50 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I deliver pizzas for a living so my car is my job. I've been losing coolant as though I've got an endless supply. I have spotted where it's ending up but not the actual leak source. Wherever it's leaking from the coolant falls onto other parts (I can't see the entire drip path and the hoses and what not are too tight together to fit my hand between) and the coolant makes its way under my car. So basically I'm having trouble locating the actual source of the leak. I do not own any pressure test device and the cheapest one I can find around me costs as much as a new radiator. I just want to know if there are any tips anyone can give me on finding the source of the leak. All help is greatly appreciated. </TEXT>
