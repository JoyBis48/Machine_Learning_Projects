	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Welcome to the new making money subreddit. I cleared out all the old spam.

The goal of this subreddit is for subscribers to talk about and share legitimate ways to make extra money as side-incomes and side-hustles. I'm hoping the subreddit will inspire those to find ways to make needed income and creatively think about how they can earn more money for themselves and their family while avoiding the many scams which tend to crop up when "making money" is mentioned.

If you have any questions or ideas, feel free to message me. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Make Money with silver Half Dollars </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-07-17 21:13:56 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> This is something I've done for years. I probably clear a few hundred dollars a year doing this (more when silver prices are high). I helps that the bank and credit union employees know me now so the save the half dollar rolls that come in.

Most people know that quarters and dimes before 1965 are made of silver and those made in 1965 and after have no silver content. Many people assume it's true for half dollars as well, but it's not. While half dollars made from 1965 - 1970 have less silver (40%) than those made 1964 and earlier (90%), their silver content still makes them worth much more than 50 cents. Check with your bank if anyone has recently cashed in half dollars in rolls, and if they have, buy them. There will often be half dollars from 1965 - 1970 in them. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  This new national monument is unique in its size and proximity to major urban centers of northern California. Situated only 100 miles from the Bay Area and Sacramento, Berryessa Snow Mountain spans 100 miles north to south. The area offers significant opportunities for exceedingly rare long-distance mountain biking trails and critical connectivity to both the Mendocino National Forest and the Bay Area Ridge Trail.

	<TEXT>  More than 20 mountain biking trails would be closed under this bill, but IMBA will not compromise on two, Castle Divide and Ants Basin, said Clark in an interview. These trails are not causing any environmental or social concerns right now. There is no viable reason for shutting them out. We think wilderness can be achieved while leaving these two trails open through special bike corridor provisions. </TEXT>

 Since the 1920s, pipeline companies have needed to get Congressional approval for a right-of-way across National Park Service lands to construct a pipeline...But three proposed billsH.R. 2295 in the House of Representatives and S. 411 and S. 1196 in the Senatewould eliminate that long-standing provision. It would remove the requirement for Congressional approval  and with that the vote of the public -- before giving away park land for a gas pipeline, subjecting that power instead to the whims of whatever political party sits in the White House at that moment. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They didn't specify in the information I received. My guess is that you might need to gather a stamp at each of the parks. The best course of action would be to ask when you get to the first park on what you need at each park to claim the patch.

Bryce Canyon did something similar to this a few years back where you could get a pin for hiking to certain places in the park and they had you take a photo on your phone to show you had actually gone to all the spots. </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2015-07-16 00:17:56 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> As part of the National Park Service 2016 centennial, those who visit all 5 national parks in Kentucky can earn a special free commemorative patch. It's being called Kentucky's National Parks Centennial Pentathlon ([Photo of the patch](http://i.imgur.com/nqw1Cqk.jpg) -- [bigger photo of patch image](http://i.imgur.com/DPmvmhG.jpg)). All five parks must be visited by April 2017 and participants must do at least one activity at each park. The specific activities are not specified, but any activity such as hiking, biking or visiting the ranger's station will count. You can do different activities at each park -- it's not necessary to do the exact same activity at each park. Basically, they want you to go to each and explore and learn while there. The five participating parks are:

* [The Abraham Lincoln Birthplace National Historical Park](http://www.nps.gov/abli)
* [Big South Fork National River and Recreation Area](http://www.nps.gov/biso)
* [Cumberland Gap National Historical Park](http://www.nps.gov/cuga)
* [Fort Heiman unit of Fort Donelson National Battlefield](http://www.nps.gov/fodo)
* [Mammoth Cave National Park](http://www.nps.gov/maca)

None of the five parks has an entrance fee, although there are fees to go on cave tours at Mammoth Cave.

	<TEXT> My orginal submission of this was removed by the mods (rightfully so due to an error on my part -- mods, thanks for the great work you do) so I've reposted a direct link to the video.

Privatizing national parks is one of the worst ideas ever. The thing is, it can sound like a good argument to those who don't understand the deceptive reasons for wanting it done. This is not a fight that should be taken lightly. The [New York Times op-ed](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/30/opinion/lets-fix-our-national-parks-not-add-more.html) shows they are willing to try and make this happen. </TEXT>
