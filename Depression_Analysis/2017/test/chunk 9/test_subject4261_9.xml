	<TEXT> That's simply not true. In your Camry or whatever sedan you prefer, an additional 4400 lbs would be devastating. Bear in mind that the most additional weight your car ever carries might be you and 4 passengers so ~900lbs. Now multiply that by ~4.5 and you're in a whole heap of shit. Or should I say, sand.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [Build Help] Need a new monitor, not sure which to buy </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-07-01 00:07:12 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I have an old monitor and am looking to buy a new one, but I've never purchased a dedicated gaming monitor. I've narrowed it down to two monitors. The **BenQ GW2760HS 27-inch VA panel HDMI LED-lit Monitor** or **ASUS VE248H 24-Inch Full-HD LED-lit LCD Monitor with Integrated Speakers**. These are the ones I've found, but I'm open to other suggestions that are in the 200$ area. Thanks! </TEXT>
