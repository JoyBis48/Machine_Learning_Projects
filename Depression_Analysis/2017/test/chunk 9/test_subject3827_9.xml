	<TEXT> I *really* doubt it. For one thing, he's too old to be playing a young (15-25 year old) Han. Secondly, he looks very little like Harrison Ford, and doesn't sound remotely like him either. The people at Disney are smart, and I think they are well aware of the fact that this choice will be heavily scrutinized, so I would expect them to cast an unknown actor who has the same mannerisms as Ford.  </TEXT>
