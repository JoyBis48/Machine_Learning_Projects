	<TEXT> Hi RedBull7!  I didn't post a link to my blog because I'm never sure if it's considered "promotion" or not on Reddit.  I always get so worried so I just figured I'd skip posting it until I was asked.  I did respond to Yurishimo after with a link to my blog as well as a list of plugins :)   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes! That plugin is awesome.  It showed that my Ready! Backup was sucking up the most resources and I've disabled it since.  Jetpack is definitely #2 on the list and I'm trying to figure out if I really need it.  Thank you for your help standard_staples :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm really such a noob and I'm not sure which resources it is lol.  My hosting company pointed me to the "resources" icon on my cpanel and it shows that I've maxed out the usage.  You were absolutely right on the backup plugin being the problem.  I've since installed p3 profiler and apparently the Ready! Backup was taking up the most juice. Since I've disabled it, the blog is much better.  Thank you so much for dropping in and helping me out :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was getting the 500 server error as well.  I figured it was because of my resources issue since I never had that problem before my blog started to slow down.  I definitely took your advice and took off a security plugin as long as quick cache.  I'm really trying hard to keep the list of plugins on my site to a minimum since I'm so worried about the resources issue lol.  Thank you for your help Yurishimo! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi lingben! I downloaded that p3 plugin you recommended, and it helped SO MUCH.  Apparently Ready! Backup was the culprit.  I disabled that plugin and it's running much better now.  You're right, jetpack is definitely using the 2nd most amount of resources and I'm trying to figure out if I really need it.  I'm pretty sure my blog is slow because of me, but I will definitely check out webhostingtalk if I change my mind.  Thank you so much for your help!! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi Trolol420!  You can definitely add a little bit of "extra" oil after the trace but some soap makers argue that you can't determine which oils become saponified during the process.  Since most of the saponification happen during the first 24 hours, even after trace it's still working.  I have no idea if this is true, but I have also read that some soap makers add more expensive oils to superfat the soap after trace.  Because they say that the qualities are retained.  I personally haven't experimented with adding oils after, but I don't see why you couldn't.  Jojoba is pretty shelf stable so even if there's extra I saponified, I wouldn't be as worried about DOS compared to grapeseed or flax oils.  I'm not sure if I helped or not lol lol.
