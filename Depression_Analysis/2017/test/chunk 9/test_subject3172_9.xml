A friend and I once went on a long road trip and we saw 48 states' worth -- and the ones we didn't see were *not* Alaska and Hawaii, as you'd expect; one was Rhode Island, I can't remember the other (we were mostly on the West Coast). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm close to your age with a similarly intimidating amount of student debt (and I never even finished my doctorate). Other commenters' advice about income-based repayments and loan forgiveness is invaluable; be sure to follow up. I found that getting that process started helped the feeling of powerlessness ease off, and it's made a difference in how well I function. 

It helps also to just know there are others in similar financial boats who are functioning OK. I was feeling real down on myself till I spoke with my mother, and she was in basically the same situation when she was my age and now she's retired and doing fine. Just hearing her story gave me a boost. It's a tough road we're on, but it's do-able. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I heard about a different case where a guy had some sort of compulsion about downloading images and burning them to CDs or something, usually he used some automated process on photo sites and never even looked at them. There was some CP among the pix and he got in serious trouble. Anyway, the guy in the OC seems to be targeting CP specifically, but in addition to that problem he probably has some compulsion issue as well. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A few years back a Starbucks opened up around the corner from where I worked, and every day someone had to go make a Starbucks run and come back with a load of their silly coffee drinks. I found this particularly annoying because the same storefront had had a locally-owned coffee shop with the same drinks only better, but they didn't have the cachet of the overdone chain. Starbucks and the property owner basically forced the local place to close. </TEXT>

I hear your desire for less conflict, but we need to work from our end of things, not other people's. What if you'd said, We don't need more Rush Limbaughs, we need more Abraham Lincolns. (Or whatever white figures you find illustrative.) See the difference? We have our own house to clean up. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In high school I liked to play chess, and one day a grandmaster came through town to play a couple of exhibitions. I was one of 10 people he played "blindfolded" -- we each sat at a chess board and he sat where he couldn't see the boards, and an intermediary went around to each board in turn and called out the move we'd made, he called out his reply, and so on. 

In this sort of event the master is bound to have a lapse in concentration at some point and make a big blunder that loses a game. By a stroke of luck it happened against me, and I was the only one of the 10 to win. I wasn't a very good player, just got lucky. Some of the other players were the best in the city, and he mowed them down without breaking a sweat.  </TEXT>
