	<TEXT> It makes too much sense that this world we inhabit is not meant for human souls. There is too much pain and suffering here. 

I feel for you OP. I'm sorry you had to endure that, and I hope Tamara either forgets her hatred, or forgives you with time. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> "But I love a good mystery too, my darling Lucy."

The sentence that chilled me to my core. Definitely a well written account of what is happening to you OP.

I will say, however, that if it is Lucy, she's a much better actress than you may have every thought possible. Just watch your step. Always remember, keep your friends close, but your enemies closer. See if you can get the sick bastard to bring up another box. The part that gets me is the fact that there were Lucy's hairs with the evidence.

Tread carefully, OP. </TEXT>
