But you can't tell with what sounds like fake enthusiasm sometimes. Its an important subject but many times it sounds like Joe flat out disagrees with these same talking points with a different guest. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I know people think this, but its really not true. 

It CAN be true, but many cultures, including even the USA, have notions of masculinity in which homosexuality isn't really accepted. In the USA at least we're ***tolerant***...in other countries, gays are seen as a distraction and a weakness in the image of the nation-state. Its prevalent in nations that don't have their shit together, but to say that these people are secretly dreaming of gay men is untrue. A lot of it is religiously based and a lot of it is flat out hatred of gays...you don't have to be exhibiting Ego-dystonic sexual orientatio to do this.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I disagree. 

Online, its out there for the world to see and ultimately you leave yourself open to THE WORLD to interpret anything and everything you say. Different demographics will interpret everything differently and a lot of people live in this bubble free from acknowledging how other people really view things. There are some people in the south who LEGITIMATELY don't even view the confederate flag in a negative light...these people haven't seen or been exposed to other view points that challenge their own

When you rush to online expressions, be prepared for any and all backlash.

Seriously...whats the deal with all this talk about SJWs instead of calling out people for actually saying ridiculous things that deserve ridicule? Its like Joe et al doesn't enjoy being called out or held accountable.  Justine Sacco said something that was incredibly offensive and yet its everyone else's fault for putting her out of a job. Not to mention she's a rich little girl who worked in public relations herself, but its always the P.C. culture for some reason.
