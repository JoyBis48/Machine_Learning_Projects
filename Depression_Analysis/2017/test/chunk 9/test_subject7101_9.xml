	<TEXT> of course they will adopt the boat turn back policy it's what voters want and the last time they changed the policy there was a rise in arrivals by boats with many deaths at sea.

abbot was able to capitalise on that so changing it now wouldn't be a good idea.

i know many people on this sub would want to see a greens style approach to it but that's not what the greater majority of voters want and it could lose votes for whatever party tries to do it. </TEXT>

Mercedes won't dominate forever, Ferrari looks the best next option unless red bull gets there shit together and gets a car that doesn't explode almost every race. Mclaren won't be a challenger for at least 3-4 years and it seems they have a driver line up for the next few years

	<TEXT> i think they really overdid the witcher sense in this game almost every quest has you following a blood trail or scent

i know it's part of a witcher to have these abilities but they really overdid it just like Assassins creed used to overdo the trailing/eavesdrop missions

it's a great game (probably the best i've played in years) but the witcher sense part of it got tiresome considering how much they use it </TEXT>

chateau d'cardboard $12-$20,
cheap vodka (or bourbon etc)- $22-$30,
bottle of cheap wine - $10-$20,
6 pack beer $16

weed is $20 a gram $50 for 3 and typically around $80-$110 a quarter

a kid can get a cask of goon and a 6 pack of beer cheaper than they can get 2 grams of weed
