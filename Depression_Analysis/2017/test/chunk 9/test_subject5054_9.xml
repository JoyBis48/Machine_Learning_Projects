	<TEXT> So how's he manage 9 FTA per in the last 4 games of that series? If you're used logic holds true (Harden's aggression is proportional to the leniency of the refs on defenders), then he reverts back after the 3rd game when he attempted his season average FTA.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> He seemed un-motivated honestly. For one reason or another - whether injury, illness or just mental unpreparedness - he wasn't playing the aggressive and decisive basketball that generally propels his success. It was frustrating to watch but at the end of the day, he's just another dude trying to do stuff, and sometimes he'll come up short because of things., and I'm just a guy watching him try, so who am I to question that guy?

Bye.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's sad that we view with contempt this man: his combination of speed and strength; his ability to penetrate  and expose defenses like the modern NBA edition of the Blitzkrieg; his acute awareness to force his opposition to resort to the desperate act of stalling - to foul.

Harden is magical... up until he gets fouled. Then it's drudgery. I get the criticism, but I don't like that getting fouled takes away from all of the other elements of his game.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Numbers can be ~~devolving~~deceiving, however. Harden was not playing aggressively at all in the playoffs last year. He was settling for a lot of bad and contested jumpers, and he wasn't attacking the basket and doing his FT collecting like he had been for a the majority of last season and this season. So while those numbers might support the narrative that "the refs clamp down on the playoffs", I believe there are more variables at play than that.

Harden gets more FTs when he is aggressive and attacks the basket, he gets less FTs when he settles for end-of-the-shotclock contested jumpers.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So it makes him a good lion, and Mufasah was technically a bad lion. He allowed two other males to share his domain. Typically they'll kill even their own male cubs, let alone their weaker younger brother. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They drank all the water? How do animals drink all the water in a closed ecosystem? The hyenas/Scar were a scapegoat for the draught. If there wasn't a draught, hyenas and lions could have lived side by side in harmony. Scar saw this and while he was hungry for power, he at least didn't subjugate an entire species to the bad lands ( la Mufasah). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> i'm a pretty respectful guy but if you wear that you're fair game IMO... which is funny because tigers are generally at the top of their food chain (just dad joke things). i have an "only you can prevent narcissism" shirt which people take pictures of quiet often (without asking). doesn't bother me; do unto others and all that. you're never wearing tiger print pants and a tiger shirt to be inconspicuous is all I'm saying. </TEXT>
