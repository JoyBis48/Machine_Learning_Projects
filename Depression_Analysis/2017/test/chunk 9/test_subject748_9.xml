	<TEXT> Hey writers,

Working on a comic-book script based on a cartoon I drew in high school a few years back. It's about a young sous chef who discovers that he's an alien from a race of hyper advanced species who's cooking can warp space and time. Now my question is, what power related to cooking or food in general could I give the protagonist, Riley? 

Thanks! </TEXT>

A week ago I wrote a short story that I realized could become a seasonal series. I'm wondering, are there any mode of distribution where people can pay for a five story 'season' or pay individually for a single story?  </TEXT>

Silas was once a top tier Rider until an accident happened with high level magic, obliterating an entire city. His best friend, Jazen, was the one responsible, but Silas blames himself for everyone who died that day. He became an alcoholic, but his life began to turn around when he adopted the boys. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey Writers,

I'm asking the above question because I'm working on a fantasy novel about dragon riders. In-universe, the rider organization takes young riders at the age of five and places them into 'family' groups to help train them. The three protagonists, Leoric, Athroben and Rysich are taken in by an veteran rider named Silas. I'm wondering how I can write this relationship and make it seem natural. 

Thanks! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Haka could be like a form of 'bending' a spell into a more powerful form by synchronizing it will your movements, then shouting to cast it. Or the rhythmic chanting would be better suited towards defensive spells. It would be a good exercise for the young practitioners to practice together to learn how to weave their brands of magic together to be more effective.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey Worldbuilders,

Working on a new series that takes place in a world like ours, but magic is real.The world of magic is hidden from normal humans. Practitioners are found and taken at a young age to focus their abilities and train in small groups around the world. 

Now, I want the magic system to be different than most. I wanted to somehow include magic from different cultures, not just the typical 'Harry Potter-flick the wand' magic that we know. The 'international magic' theme would fit with weapons, because each practitioner would have a weapon from the culture that their magic steams from. For example, a Egyptian magic user might use a crook or Keopesh (curved sword) as a focus for their magic and hand to hand weapon. 

So, any ideas on how I can make cultural magic work? What kind of weapons could be added?   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey Redditors,

Had an idea for a game. The player makes their own supervillain and rival superhero before starting the game in a randomly generated main city. The player then can begin aquirring a base, money through bank robberies, and start building gear based on their theme and powers. Once the player feels like they're ready, they can go after large scale goal. This can be whatever they desire, such as stealing a dinosaur skeleton, robbing the local gold depository or even just causing mayhem. Their rival superhero will spawn and engage the player in a boss fight. Upon defeat, the player can escape or be arrested, if they didn't think ahead or have some other plan. 

Aside from this, I would like some input or ideas! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey Redditors. How can I creativity contain demons in an urban fantasy setting?

-Edit: Wow, thanks everyone! I've come to a conclusion on what I can do. For lower demons they can be simply sent back to wherever they came from with a banishment spell and some salt. Stronger demons or those who are bound to a human host must be imprisoned in a premade cell at a warehouse designed to hold different types of demons.

	<TEXT> I personally hate the whole 'salt shotgun' idea. It works on the show, but in other stories, whenever it's mentioned, it takes the tension away. Supernatural is one of those shows that had a unique idea, but the fans sometimes take it way too far and say it works for everything. Stuffing rocksalt into a shotgun doesn't work. Just....no. Listen, I don't mean to offend any Supernatural fans, I enjoy the show too, but please don't apply their rules to this story. Thanks. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ok, I think I'll throw my hat in the ring and make a character. 

Name: Axotl
Lore: Axotl is a mutant similar to Fish and Chicken. He is a mutated lab salamander who was raised with other young mutants in an abandoned laboratory. One day, Axotl found a combat robot in the lab basement and reprogramed it to help him look for the legendary Nuclear Throne. Axotl's appearance is similar to a Spotted Salamander, but with the gills and tail of a Axolotl. 

Starting Weapon- Crossbow

Passive ability- Child of Science: Less rad's are needed to get a mutation. However, the mutations will be limited to only two choices. 

Active ability- When Axotl's active is used, his combat robot, Rust-O,will be spawned, taking up 2 rads. If a player's rad supply is low, health will be taken instead. Rust-O will behave similar to Rouge's allies, fighting off enemies until he is killed. Rust-O has a energy ball attack similar to the bandit's.

Throne Butt:  Rust-O will only cost one rad and he'll stay on the field longer. 

Ultra A: Child of Science will instantly allow a mutation, even without rads. 

Ultra B: Rust-O get's upgraded with a laser weapon.

-Rust-O is the coolest

-Science rules

-No more home

-The Throne will ease the pain

-Where is my mother? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> The Thing in the Breakroom </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-06-17 19:43:12 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Last summer, I was able to get an internship at my hometown's radio-station, KVW, outside of El Paso. During the day, things went well. I got along with the other interns and enjoyed my duties; making coffee, cleaning the bathrooms, ordering the files and placing calls for special guests. But that was during the day. 

See, in my small town of Dune Acres we have a story that get's passed around. Dune Acres was once a thriving prospecting settlement, and most of it's population consisted of both Caucasian and Mexican people. They got along fairly well until a Mexican man was falsely accused of raping a white woman. The Mexicans, knowing that the accusation was false became enraged and according to some, summoned a being from Hell to get revenge. But the summoning went wrong, and after blood was spilt, the demon was trapped on our plane of existence, bound the the woman who summoned him, becoming a demonic hybrid unable to cross into heaven or hell. But on the full moon, she makes her presence known at midnight and says a rhyme. If anyone listens to it through all four verses or looks into her eyes, she takes them away.  

But these were stories my older sister told me for a scare, and as I got older I disregarded them. But when Shock Jock Lock, the station manager told me and a few of the other interns that we'd be working nights next week, my mind began to wonder about that story. My friends Seth and Jenna were working with me on the night shift, so it wasn't that bad. In fact, an hour after we got to work, we were cracking jokes and playing Cards Against Humanity, so I completely forgot about it. Then, at around eleven fifty, I heard a thumping sound from the hallway outside the breakroom where I was making coffee. I assumed it was Seth or Jenna having a rubber band fight or throwing the football we'd found earlier. But then I heard a shaky voice that sounded old and muffled, as if someone had filled their mouth with dirt and tried to talk. The weird mumbling voice seemed to get closer, and as it did, I swore, I could almost make it out what the voice was saying. 

*The Grandmother arrives at midnight*
*To address the town*
*Give up the good children, let me take them down.*

I froze and the 'Welcome to Nightvale' mug slipped out of my hand and shattered against the linoleum floor as the light's began to flicker. That was the first verse of the rhyme that my sister told me. The thumping sound became steady and seemed to pick up speed, coming down the hallway. I managed to shake myself out of the grip of fear and lunged for the door, slamming it shut just as the noise rounded the corner. For a few agonizing seconds the doorknob was rattled and jostled before it stopped. I held my breath as something metallic was ran over the door right where my back was positioned. 

*It's been so long grandchild, you never come around*
*Why don't you, why don't you*
*Please come down*

I felt my blood freeze when I heard Seth's voice in the hallway. 

"Yo, hermano, let's have that coffee already, I need the caffeine!" A wave of relif washed over me. Seth! Thank God, this *was* a prank! I wrenched the door open, but screamed at what I saw. A gnarled *ancient* woman, wearing a ratty prairie dress speckled with what appeared to be blood and bits of sinew. Her bare arms were pockmarked with tiny holes and jutting out from them were black spikes, a few of which were pulsating and undulating, as if worms were writhing under the skin beneath them. Her lower jaw looked as if it was dislocated and hung, unnaturally wide, with two twin slashes across the sides of her mouth.  But the worst part was her eyes. They were empty sockets, with deep cuts around them, as if they had been ripped out. She extended one gnarled and bloodied finger and pointed it at my chest. 

*I have my grandchild* she said, in Seth's voice. I don't remember what happened next, but I ran before she could grab me. I ran as fast as I could, away from the station, away from my home and friends. I know she'll be after me. I haven't slept in two days. Right now, I am hiding in a truck stop bathroom in Colorado and the lights- well the lights are flickering.
