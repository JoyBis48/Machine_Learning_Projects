	<TEXT> Ok, let's discuss.

I made 80k/yr and my engineers made 65k/yr, and I have a GED. 

I managed data centers for one of the 2 biggest banks in the US. I did it well, and my engineers did a good job as well. We worked for a company that is still making good profits and was back when I worked for them. 

But a new VP of operations came in and decided that if he saved money he would look good. So he undid what had been done (moving from outsourcing to IBM to insourcing) and fired all the engineers in data centers - and replaced them with people making 12.50/hr. 

These guys had mortgages, car payments, pension plans, etc - but hey, let's save a few bucks more. Oh, and now - about 6 years later - there is a new vp in place who is struggling with issues this has caused (replacing good techs with cheap labor).

Now...you may be asking yourself, what does this have to do with minimum wage and such?

Good question. Thing is, too many companies are run by people with short term ideals. Yes - you can train someone else to flip those burgers. But that takes time and resources away from people who have experience at those jobs.  

Companies get a few people in power who want to please a short term financial goal and will ditch well trained people already working there because they have attitudes like yours. It's all a numbers game to them - cut some costs real quick, get a bonus, and screw the long term because I have a business degree and can get another job.

Long story short, these little people are the ones out there doing the day to day work that needs to be done that no one else will do, is it too much to ask that they get a piece of the benefits of that labor? Again - why the hell do we praise the people not doing the work when they get the rewards from the company's profits but vilify others when they want to get back what they have invested (their labor/time).

	<TEXT> Nice try. There are all sorts of regulations that you can play this with. Like, you can't dump raw sewage into the river. OOOhhhh scary, now company has to pay to have it properly disposed of.

Naw, the right just likes to whine when the people who do the actual working get a little more. They wish we could pay wages like in Vietnam or have child slave labor. Sorry, society progresses over time away from such things. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> And then there is this:

 Charles Lieberman, chief investment officer at Advisors Capital Management, with assets of $1.2 billion, notes that Chipotles same-store sales have been rising by more than 10% annually, **but about six percentage points of the growth comes from price hikes that could cost the chain customers.** Theyre opening 200 new units a year, says Lieberman. Its very hard to find that many good locations and sustain such a rapid expansion without cannibalizing existing units or accepting less-attractive locations.

So they have been raising prices all over the place, pumping money into new stores, and keeping the investors happy by kicking up prices - but yeah, no one complained about that did they?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Meh. Their cost of renting there is double elsewhere so their costs will be impacted more, so it's more of a one off scenario for them.

Their stock has been going down, competition is getting more funds. But here is the funny thing....

When companies like this, and others, raise their prices, or in case of groceries put less ounces in a box and charge the same, etc so that investors can get more money I don't hear the right complaining at all.

Funny how they only whine like babies when the people doing the actual work get more of the pie. Watch - this story will be all over the con blogosphere, and yet not a peep from them when other prices go up because the wealthy wanted more profit from people.

Funny how that works. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am sure we could agree on a lot.

As far as the teach the man to fish meme - that works well until you realize that a few big fishing companies own the boats and have nets while all the person has is a single line and there are less and less fish to catch.

When the lake is controlled by the few then the many won't have enough fish to catch.

Add to that how conservatives claim on one hand that there aren't any jobs because obama sucks - then they turn around and claim that if they extend unemployment benefits it will make people lazy and they won't look for work it gets fun. Either there aren't enough jobs or there are.

Then they claim all the new jobs are just crappy low paying part time jobs. Well, people in those jobs could certainly use aid.

	<TEXT> Oh I see the virtues. But then you don't need religion to have virtues.

The people over there not condemning this (and you won't hear about them in the news if some did) are complicit IMHO.

Which leads to - is the same true here?

You have mostly christians, who tend to be conservative, fighting against helping people here, wars, etc (as mentioned) - and instead of churches saying it's crap and wrong, they are joining in on the conservative messages.

As far as the attack in the church - think about it. It wasn't a cop who did it. When cops do things they get away with it. An individual is not a government employee - and he was arrested and charged, not given paid time off. So yeah. A difference. </TEXT>

When you have a group of people who deny climate change cause 'jeebus' i see them as loony.

When you have people who will fight against health care for people, food for the starving, and promote corporate greed as next to godliness I say they are loony and hurting many people.

These same christians were for a senseless war and the killing of over 100k people in said war. 

Oh...I guess it is different when you kill people from afar, or don't see the person suffering in illness or hunger.

But when you use your religion to accomplish those things to please your god (out of fear he will kill us all, like with gay marriage/hurricanes/etc) you are as damned loony as these people. </TEXT>

It's always been that way with conservatives. They blamed the irish immigrants and demonized them. The Jews as well. On and on it goes because they always need someone to scare people into voting for them so they can be saved. 

They all want to be the Jesus and save people - except when it comes to health care and hunger, you know - the things people are actually needing. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No one seems to whine when investors want more return and prices go up, productivity up, wages down, quality down, etc.

But god forbid the people who do the actual work and aren't sitting on a beach sipping coronas wants a little more money for their labor. 

I have watched as products in stores shrank and prices went up, as fast food prices have went up over the decades but wages didn't match. Seen companies outsource American jobs to save money but kept prices the same or higher.

Funny how the right only complains when the hard working people want more. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah - conservatives have been hypersensitive to gays for a long time - wanted them banned from serving their country and being able to get married. 

I have never seen so much whining and crying an outlandish gibberish as I have seen from any group in my life as I have oversensitive conservatives. "omg, gay marriage is our new 9/11, there will be a civil war, god will strike down the US, our time is over, etc". </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Because there are less bigots in politics here than websites like The Blaze, Free Republic, and Deadbart.

Conservatives are against gays serving their country, getting married, helping the sick, aiding the poor, and feeding the hungry - all because they believe their god will get all mad if they do and America will be punished.

Now, when it comes to spending money on wars, weapons, Israel they will gladly spend our money. 

I am guessing many folks in politics lived through the bush years an remember the tax cuts for the rich, republicans pushing for spending more and more on wars (off the books to some extent), bailing out corporations and giving them a tax holiday, etc and so on and saw how that played out.

I was, up until 2003 one of those people who voted for republicans was pretty conservative. I will never, in my lifetime, vote for another republican. They have moved so far to the right it shocks me - they would run reagan out of town for being too liberal.

Don't ever trust a conservative - money comes first for them, then using their god for laws (except when it comes to shrimp eating, working on the sabbath, etc...then suddenly they laugh at their own bible and slam it shut. But lordy, when it comes to gays and the poor they will find em some verses to use). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You fail right off with the education thing. The system wasn't broken - folks told others it was broken so that they could 'solve' the issue (by using vouchers/charter schools to funnel money from public to private hands).

That is what I am talking about - fear, etc. Tell someone there is a problem and then offer them a solution. And people buy it all the time. 

I am 49 years old. As long as I can remember people have said the economy was bad, education system was broken, Iran was getting a nuke, someone was going to kill us all, and jesus would be back any day now.

You would think after 49 years those problems would have been solved. But just wait, this election, you will hear all those problems still exist. And they always will because it gets people to vote for others to 'save' them from said problems. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That is your problem - you believe it is the word of god with no proof that there is even a god.

And hey, if you want religion to rule your life and you want to live by it - fine. Go for it. Just don't involve everyone else.

Guess what? Those isis folks believe they have the word of god as well and want people to follow it - why aren't you jumping up and obeying their god? Maybe for the same reason I am not wanting to obey your god and his rules. And I don't want folks of either faith making laws here based on their beliefs. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Did such questions come up after interracial marriage was allowed?

Anyway, christians would say that since it was in the bible it must have been god's will. Heck, there was a lot of incest, polygamy,  and lying in the bible by the jews in the OT - Adam and Eve had kids, and since they were the only two people ever made there had to be some weird stuff going on there.

Noah and his family? I mean, really, just read Genesis for starters - the right does what they do because of their bible, it's why they so protested gay marriage (but they are ok with dumb wars, letting the sick die, not feeding the hungry or helping those in need...yeah, I don't understand the right either).

So my view is a societal one. Do what you will just don't harm others. Consenting adults want to shack up, not my business.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Cons believe God is in control. Well..unless it involves defense. Then, suddenly, they don't trust their god at all. Ask em why they send so many tax dollars to Israel (but hate helping out Americans in need and tell em just to work harder).

Conservatives use god, day in and day out, in an effort to control others - they hate people being different than them and will do anything to try and force their ideal of 'normalcy' onto people (they are, indeed, like isis). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> LOL. Yeah, right. Ok.

You should crack open a history book something and look at things. I am guessing you might find that some people couldn't get a divorce because they coded into law that men had the power. Same men who were sleeping around on their women. 

Kings, barons, leaders, etc - all through history they "held marriage together" by force of law and keeping women down so they had no choice but to stay and obey.

It really pisses off the right that women got more rights and didn't have to be virtual slaves. 

I get why the right is mad - they don't have the power to control lives of others like they desire.

Your religion is showing. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Because the right knows how to use fear to control their own.

It is always some new enemy they must defeat. They scare people into believing they are the solution. From muslims to gays to people on welfare, etc people on the right are always afraid (and part of that fear is tied to their 'god' and how he might kill us all).

Education: The peddled fear for years on it. Said it was failing, America was failing, and the best way to solve the problem was to turn things over to private companies (charter schools, etc).

Terrorism: We just need these wars, patriot act, etc and we can stop the terrorists from killing us all. So let's grow government, remove rights, and increase spending. But still....they say we are under more threat today than ever before. Sell fear, sell a solution.

Climate change: OOOPS since this isn't local to America and scientists all over the world are talking about it isn't real. But what is real is those evil scientists want to take your hard earned money. So they sell fear of science to people and propose a solution - ignore it and spend money on weapons instead.

Health Care: This will just cost us money and save lives of Americans. Money is good. We should tell people instead the only thing they have to fear is terrorism/isis/iran and take their money to stop them instead. Who cares if you die because you can't get needed care? Not conservative Christians....

People who vote for republicans do so because they cannot think for themselves and are always afraid that some god is gonna hurt us all. Republicans claim they can 'save us all' from our sins. Why do you think fundamentalist christians, racists, etc, vote for that party? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Wow, you sure are butt hurt over people gaining their freedoms.

Wanna know who has hurt marriage? Fundies with their 'wives need to submit' and all that BS around such sexism. 

And speaking of monogamous - are you saying people having been diddling others for 6000 years (age of earth according to RW scientists)?

No, marriage was destroyed alright, by the right wing, long ago. You treat women like property, blacks and indians the same, and you cower behind a bible and claims that this is how your god wants it and if we don't conform he will kill us all.

You lost, you will always lose to progress. Get used to it. </TEXT>
