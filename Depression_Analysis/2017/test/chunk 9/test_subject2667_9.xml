	<TEXT> It's actually three substitutions for the entire game, not the half, and that's true worldwide, in every top tier league in every country. 

It's only in college and youth soccer in the United States that the substitution rules are different (some subs can come back in the game, there's more than three, etc.). 

Regarding strategy in subs, yes, they are used for that, and they are also used to sub out tired players. It's up to the coach of each team. Sometimes a coach feels the need to make tactical adjustments with different players, and sometimes a player gets hurt or gets tired.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If a dog sniffs you, or their saliva touches you, you become ritually unclean and can't pray unless you wash with something other than water (old traditions say sand, soap is used now), and that basically means a shower. I don't fear a dog that isn't attacking me, but I pray five times a day and I can't go run and shower and/or change clothing.

As such, Muslims are discouraged from keeping dogs unless we have a real purpose, like for hunting, using one as a guard dog or herding sheep on a farm, for example. This has led to Muslims seeming skittish about dogs, and since we don't keep them as pets, those of us who never spent much time around them (i.e. people who grew up in Muslim countries) may have some misconceptions about dogs. 

Really, though, most of us keep our distance because we're thinking about the next prayer and don't want to deal with showering and changing clothes. 

I was way off on the state, lol. I'm in PA.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I live closer to the Amish than you do, lol. We probably live in the same state. I consider myself practicing, and no, it is not a sin to talk to you. Many Muslim women who cover wear jeans, actually most of of the young Muslim women I've met in the states wear jeans. 

Women aren't required to have a man escorting them everywhere. In some of the more conservative Muslim countries,  sure, that rule is there and it is misguided, but the lack of education of many there makes it a safety issue for women. 

I've been to Iran, Pakistan, Iraq (mid 1990s), Syria, the West Bank, Egypt, Dubai and Jordan, and I've seen women walking around all the time on their own without a male guardian. My mother and sister got to work every day on their own and both wear the hijab.

We use modern technology,  unlike the Amish, and we tend to wear all types of clothing, unlike them.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Meanwhile millions of Muslims go through live every day, going to school, going to their jobs, raising their families, living their lives as ordinary citizens, throughout Europe and the United States, not bothering anyone. 

Except you though. Because you sat behind your computer screen, read a couple of articles about some out of the blue, rare, abhorrent actions, and decided that those actions defined an entire religion made up of a billion plus people. 

I can see some radical, sitting behind a computer in a far off Muslim country, hearing about a terrorist attack in response to a U.S./coalition bombing and thinking, "You can do your Do-As-We-Say shit in the U.S. or Europe, but here we will not tolerate it. We will not have non-Muslims control our behavior through violent acts."

You aren't quite that different from that radical. He doesn't have the benefit of an education, so he might do something stupid. Thankfully, all you'll ever do is post stupid things on the internet and continue thinking stupid thoughts.  </TEXT>

 According to the source, Israel offered a four-point proposal that addressed most of the Palestinians grievances.

 1. Palestinian players and coaches will receive special documents to facilitate their travel from Gaza to the West Bank and abroad.

 2. Israel will ease restrictions and promote soccer-related projects in the West Bank, including the construction of a stadium and other facilities.

 3. Israel would cover the costs of tax and customs for sports equipment imported by the Palestinians to the West Bank via Israel  predominantly via the Ashdod seaport.

 4. A joint committee comprised of representatives from Israel, the Palestinian Authority and FIFA would be formed and would convene monthly to address day-to-day issues and any problems that arise. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  It's important also to note that Jordan is a constitutional monarchy, not an absolute monarchy like the Gulf states,

Eh, this is debatable. They profess to be a constitutional monarchy, but the Hashemite family pretty much calls the shots. They have a secret police and political dissenters aren't always free to express their opinions. They are somewhat better than the Gulf states, but aren't a constitutional monarchy like England or Spain.  </TEXT>

Lancaster is a really cool city with tons to do that has a lot of shopping, organic stores, great restaurants and young people, and since that would really be far from Gettysburg, York is your best bet.  </TEXT>

You took two paragraphs about a subject not related to the main focus of the article. In any case, the quote you pulled says that the state's attorney concluded this fact, not that she was right or wrong in doing so. 

In no way have you addressed the main content of the article: what happened to Detective Crystal after he reported his fellow officers for misconduct.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  I guess you can waddle back to BCND and tell everyone how P S disregarded the article because of the source.

Can you honestly tell me how that is helpful to any discussion? What's done is done now. It seems you're having a bad day, and I'm sorry if this article was just the straw that broke the camel's back. What do you think about the article? Is it unfairly prosecuting? Does the officer in question have a compelling story or does something not add up? Please, I mean no offense.

	<TEXT> Please, enlighten me. 

Posters in this thread are judging the story by the domain name, and I see few comments on the actual content of the article itself. i didn't post here to provoke or insult police officers. I wanted to see the genuine opinions of police officers on this subject, positive or negative. Is anyone willing to say anything?  </TEXT>

Uh, yeah, ever heard of [Serpico?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serpico). This isn't new, and that's not an appropriate way to respond to public criticism. You're not doing yourself or your fellow officers any favors.
