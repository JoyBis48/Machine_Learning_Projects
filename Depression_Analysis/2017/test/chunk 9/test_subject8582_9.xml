	<TEXT> There's Sadamoto's manga, which tells the same story, but with several minor (and some major) differences (For one, Kaworu shows up way earlier and is actually a full-fludged character). There's a couple other mangas as well, like Campus Apocalypse, but none of them are really very good like the original. 

Once you've gotten to every Evangelion medium, you could try some other, similar shows. Gunbuster was the first work of Evangelion's director, Hideaki Anno. It's also a great work which greatly influenced mecha, especially Evangelion. They also share similar themes and characters, to the point where Shinji seems like Gunbuster's Noriko with a dick. There's also Gurren Lagann, which is an incredibly badass sort-of-parody of Evangelion. Finally, Madoka Magica. In the most basic sense, it's Evangelion with magical girls instead of mechs.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My favorite fun Super Robot show is Gunbuster (and to a lesser extent, its sequel, Diebuster). Another Gainax mecha which TTGL takes heavy inspiration from (some people even claim that the end result of TTGL was an attempt to one-up the size of the Diebuster). IT's a classic that every mecha/anime fan should watch at least once. Considering TTGL is less of a show and more of a "best-of" video of mecha influence, a lot of it is taken straight from the playbook of Gunbuster. 

There's also Getter Robo and Mazinger, which I can't personally attest to, but are some of the other classic Super Robots that really shaped the genre (apparently someone cuts a planet in half in Shin Getter Robo)

If you start feeling depressed, hit up Evangelion. Alongside TTGL and Gun/Diebuster, it stands at the top of the Super Robot genre. It's the deconstruction of the genre, being much more character-focused and less action-focused (don't let that turn you off, I actually consider it the greatest anime of all time). While not enjoyable for the same reasons as TTGL, you should certainly watch it. Gurren Lagann was actually somewhat of a parody of Evangelion (when you watch the show you'll see what I mean. There's a lot of connections).  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The only model of the 3DS that's compatible with amiibo is the New 3DS XL. The only amiibo compatible games for the N3DS are Smash Bros 3DS (Which works with every amiibo except Splatoon and Toad, so far), Code Name S.T.E.A.M. (which works with the Fire Emblem amiibos, so don't even trip cause you won't get your hands on one of those), Ace Combat Assault: Horizon Legacy (which works with most amiibos), and Xenoblade Chronicles 3D (Which only works with Shulk. In other words, no amiibo compatibility)

[here's](http://www.nintendo.com/amiibo/compatibility) the compatibility chart </TEXT>
