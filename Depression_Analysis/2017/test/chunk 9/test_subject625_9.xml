	<TEXT> Okay so I ended up getting the Logitech G600: http://gaming.logitech.com/en-us/product/g600-mmo-gaming-mouse

it's a good mouse, has a ton of buttons (A third button to the right of the right mouse clicker AND side buttons on the scroll wheel) plus custom LED's, the works. Not sure if I can handle it all though! I just tried last night and remapped all my hotkeys and it's a little overwhelming. Maybe I just have to get used to it? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Hotkey management? </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I've been meaning to get a mouse with more keys but I haven't been playing many games that demanded more buttons lately. All that changed when I bought Grim Dawn during the Summer Sale. Right now I'm stuck with the basic keyboard hotkey setup and five extra buttons to use on my mouse. What's everyone else's setup like? Any mice recommendations? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Dude I thought I was the only one.

Not only do I not have the urge to talk, I'm just 200% chill. I can sit there in silence and just watch everyone around me and be fine. It's also a little difficult for me to speak when I'm high cause my voice gets all shaky and quiet. Not really nervous but you can tell I'm blazed. My friends don't get it, they're much rowdier than me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> But it's not hard to realize that it has a slash through "$80". I think it's common sense that most people know new games are worth $59.99 so if they "accidentally" click on it then I mean really, how can you be that careless? Not you in specific but anyone who would get angry at such a thing. I don't think they were trying to trick anyone and be nefarious about the whole thing.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> "Your game wasn't on sale so take THAT! HMPH!"

Come ooooonnnnnn haha The game only came out a little bit ago anyway. Plenty of brand new games didn't get a sale. Not Rockstar's fault everyone's too cheap to pay full price for a game. You aren't entitled to a sale. </TEXT>
