	<TEXT> Forget about it, the Cavs just barely squeaked past a Hawks team minus Horford, Korver and Sefolosha. They had a hard fight against a Bulls team with a hobbled Noah, an absent/injured Pau Gasol and a terrible offense that seemed to rely on Derrick Rose prayers. Lebron is wearing down and cramping while playing massive minutes. I'm expecting a bloodbath in the finals. </TEXT>
