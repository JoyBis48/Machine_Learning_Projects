	<TEXT> Now you're just spreading misinformation, that I"ll argue with.

[What is a hate crime?](http://geneq.berkeley.edu/what_is_a_hate_crime)

**Physically assaulting someone while using derogatory racial, sexual, etc. words**

	<TEXT> It's kind of easy to derive that sort of thinking when you respond to an objective and rational post with. "stop being so emotional."
