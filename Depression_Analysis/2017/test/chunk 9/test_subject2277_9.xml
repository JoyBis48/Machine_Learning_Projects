He made choices and now he's facing consequences for those choices.

	<TEXT> I read the entire story.

He never once advised he was declaring the income to the IRS.

Even more damning, I now see he tweaked his suggestion, that on top of the winners, he recommended **all participants** gift him 10%.

If you think he was paying tax on his gambling operation, I've some swamp land in Florida I'd like to sell you. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 'That winners, if they were satisfied with the experience of playing in the pool, give him a "gift" amounting to 10 percent of the amount they collected.'

I know a lot of you **hate** cops, but he was operating outside the law.

The cops should have just ignored his tax free nearly million dollar gambling operation?

Edit - note to self, do not question the prevailing opinion or suffer downvotes.  Lol.

Does anybody else hate cops?  They're totally the worst.  Fucking pigs interfering with this guys black market gambling operation.   There I'm one of you now, upvote guyz! </TEXT>

So screw it.  Let the weeds grow and my days of toiling over that little patch of grass and spending hundreds of dollars are over.

I have a Japanese lilac tree, columbrian maple tree and a hybrid Apple tree + 3 pyramid cedars + 2 lilac bushes, one of which is a beautiful 10 feet tall.



That's plenty of oxygen.

Without chemical herbicides at my disposal in Ontario for low cost, I now accept that my lawn is going to go to hell and one day, I will simply have to completely landscape my front and back yards, as the lawn is going to turn into a pasture.

Water my lawn?  Ha-ha, no. </TEXT>
