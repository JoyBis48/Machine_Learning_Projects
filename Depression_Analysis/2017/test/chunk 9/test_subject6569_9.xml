	<TEXT> From Wikipedia
 As of the census[10] of 2000, there were 5,920 people, 2,371 households, and 1,707 families residing in the county. Since 2000, however, **an oil boom has increased the population by at least 1,000.**

Guessing it has a lot to do with that (at least for the employment age brackets).

	<TEXT> Here's my prediction: Federer gets the first two sets, Murray the third, Federer wins it in the 4th set tie break. 

EDIT: So far, so good. 1-0 Federer

EDIT 2: We're still on course! 2-0 Federer

EDIT 3: Federer was in a hurry. No 4th set tiebreak.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Anderson with 3 aces in the first game...

EDIT: 2 break points for Anderson. Wait. 1 break point.

EDIT 2:  "Fidnee Lob". How come so many of the umpires are unable to pronounce the (very limited) jargon essential for their job? They could learn it in like ten minutes...

EDIT 3: Fantastic ralley at 2-2, 30:15

EDIT 4: Another Deuce in a Novak serving game. Wait, he's got it. Phew!

EDIT 5: Novak with no answers to Anderson's serve as of yet...

EDIT 6: In my heart of hearts I thought this would be a quick affair, with Djokovic coming out on top. Not looking that way right now...

EDIT 7: Was Anderson targeting Hawkeye with that return?

EDIT 8: Anderson could win it in the next game. Crazy...

EDIT 9: But he doesn't. 5-5.

EDIT 10: that's a bad double fault from Anderson. 15-30.

EDIT 11: Djokovic breaks and gets to serve for the match! Anderson self-destructed in this game...

EDIT 12: 0:30! Are we going to tiebreak?

EDIT 13: matchpoint Djoker!

EDIT 14: Djoker sews it up on the first try. Wow, how intense was this?! </TEXT>
