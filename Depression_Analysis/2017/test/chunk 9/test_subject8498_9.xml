Maybe it's a busy photo as you say, but I think it's looking good so far. Try something simpler if you want though, like a portrait with no background. Do the face, eyes, lips, etc. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As a photographer, this is amazing. My contract also says very clearly that, if the work were to be cancelled by the client, the retainer is non-refundable. When you put a retainer you are compromising with that person to save that date specifically for you, and if other jobs come along you obviously reject them. If I were to cancel because I had a problem on my side, of course I'm returning 100% of those profits as well as giving you my best recomendations with other photographers. But you cancel me, fuck you.  

I applaud this person, giving the money to GLAD, that's just epic. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I noticed what you're pointing me, but trust me, no-one else but people who use Photoshop does, that why I didn't say anything. It's barely noticeable and there's like 0 chances someone who doesn't photoshops sees that.  

I didn't know that image from Reuters, that's... I have no words. I don't think that's the photographer's fault though, most of the time this guys or even the magazines have other editors that "improve" (obvious quotation marks here) their photos for them. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks for sharing your process. I reccomend you read a bit about the Pen tool for selecting, it's far more precise than the laso tool. I think you did a great job, 10/10.  

The reshaping tool I used for the squares from the dress is selecting a part of the image and warping it, I believe it's present in CS2! It's under Edit - Transform - **Warp**. Check it, I believe it's there. I just use a personal shortcut (CTRL+W, which in default mode closes Photoshop I believe) so that's why you you don't see me picking it. </TEXT>

Definitely the best way is to practice, a lot. There are some great free tutorials and videos out there for you to check. There's also tons of pages that offers great high quality JPGs and RAWs to practice different techniques. When you know your way around the tools, then you can watch speedup videos and learn about different tips and editing techniques, every editor has their own tips and bits that help around the editing process. I've learned so much watching timelapses, it's incredible.  

But anyways, that's my tip. Read tutorials, watch videos (do both, reading tutorials first so you get the grasp more easily and with time), and practice a lot. I'd say the learning curve is fairly fast at the begining. One thing about Photoshop is that you can always learn something new. Use as many layers as you need. Never use the eraser tool, always mask. **Don't be afraid of making mistakes.** We have CTRL ALT Z for that one. And post in forums to recieve critique, be open to the advice and... practice. Practice, practice, practice. :)

	<TEXT> I use frequency separation for very special skin retouches only, like some fashion productions or a photobook, and mostly with super close up portraits where the skin has lots of details and I can't afford to miss them. It's an incredible technique, super useful, but I find that the Healing Brush tool can acomplish similar results in faster ways, in photos that don't require much retouching as the ones I mentioned. For those I stick with freq separation, you mantain the level of detail and lose none of the color and luminosity, it's amazing. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Estoy de acuerdo. Es una cagada? Por supuesto, pero valoro ms mi vida que **cualquier** cosa material que puedan sacarme. Igualmente, no garantiza nada.  

Hace unas semanas en Moreno (Paso del Rey para ser exactos) a un paciente de mi vieja (psicloga) lo agarraron unos pendejos de 17/20 a la 1am. Iba caminado con la mochila atrs y de repente lo tiran al piso, agarrndolo de la mochila. El tipo les dijo "tranquilos chicos, llevense todo". Lo cagaron a trompadas, lo tajearon, y no le cortaron el cuello por casualidad (lleg a ponerse la mano y le regalaron 15 puntos en una palma). Brutal. Le sacaron celular y billetera y se fueron. No se resisti, no se puso nervioso, se fue con un tabique roto, la cara moretoneada y vivo de pedo.  

Evidentemente no resistirse no garantiza nada, pero s, reduce muchos las chances de que cobres.

	<TEXT> Man... That sucks. I have a bit of experience with psychedelics and let me tell you, they can fuck-you-up. The last time I consumed a powerful psych was Salvia about 5 or 6 months ago, which is one of my favorites. It wasn't a bad trip or anything like that, but the intensity and duration of it made me want to stop for a little while. I got an existential crisis with it that brought me a great deal of anxiety over the next months and that I'm still battling to get over. I started doubting reality a lot. Like, really doubting. I got severe HPPD that now has luckily toned down a lot and there were moments were I was almost sure I was hallucinating the whole reality. Really fucking irresponsible from my part to have reached this point, but well. Had to cut clean the weed also because it wasn't healping with my anxiety either.    

I'm glad I stopped because my biggest fear was to end up like your friend. I know a people or two who have done psychedelics an awful, awful lot and they giggle over the silliest things, have lapsus like you describe and just aren't the same. It's cool to experience what psychedelics have to offer but it should be done under extreme responsibility and control of yourself. I hope your friend gets better :)  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not mine, a friend's. Pretty normal for the deepweb actually, he bought DMT from India and it arrived here to Argentina a few months later, inside of an air pocket on a fake bank letter. The very wtf part was that the dude sent a tab of LSD free of charge as well, which is very fucking weird. Well, I never bought drugs on the dw so maybe that's some kind of a normal deal, but it doesn't sound normal to me. Everything was legit, the tabs were good LSD and the DMT was good purity also. </TEXT>
