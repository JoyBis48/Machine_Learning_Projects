	<TEXT> This wasn't much of a shrink in die size compared to others (from 32-14) so the performance isn't a massive step up (relatively speaking, again). The problem at that scale is that the more the die shrinks, the more opportunity there will be for failures, errors, etc...and even if these chips are clocked down (which they probably have to be) that's a lot of heat to take care of. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If not, has that been a slow evolution away from placing any value on it (and what it might mean for your machine to wind up on the Top 500) or did it never matter? And bonus question--does the new companion benchmark (HPCG) seem like it will be any more valuable? If it's not valuable and your organization still runs LINPACK and publishes Top 500 results, why do it? Vendor pressure? Curiosity? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ah well damn. It looks like I grabbed the link to the map itself--the way machine learning was used in the research project to create it was a cool little story but now that page on github isn't working at all. I'll try to load it again in a bit--if it doesn't I'll post a quick synopsis. It's not rocket science, but I can see how things like this can be personalized and integrated into mobile mapping functions and applications. </TEXT>
