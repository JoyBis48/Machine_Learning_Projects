	<TEXT> Hi all, I have just purchased some John Frieda volumising shampoo and conditioner and some hair mousse. I have only tried it a few times, and had not much change so was wondering if anyone had any ideas onto a to create more volume in hair. My hair is bum length, red/Brown and never coloured before, it's quite dull and flat too. 

Thanks :)  </TEXT>
