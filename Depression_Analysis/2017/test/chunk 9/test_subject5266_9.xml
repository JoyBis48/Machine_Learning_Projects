	<TEXT> I actually hope Bethesda pick him/them all up. They are traditionally a solid SP company and had Mikami for evil within, so its possible yeah? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Bethesda would be my favorite pick. They are very supportive of new and interesting visions and have the bank to back it up. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's nice to see him being recognized en masse like this, he genuinely seemed like lovely guy and I think everyone can agree Nintendo's ability to have fun with itself and just enjoy entertaining others is an admirable trait. I'm so sad for his family, friends and coworkers, he has definitely left his mark on Nintendo. They will remember him well.

RIP </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They weren't to know, but there is a lesson here about trying our best to be a happier and more upbeat gaming community. I know I've said some pretty demanding/angry things about Nintendo in the past - this was wrong to do and I've since been more positive and flexible to change/ideas.

I really enjoyed their latest conference, there was always a sense of fun and not taking things too seriously when it came to Nintendo pressers/directs, so maybe we as a community should strive to meet that standard. 

Have fun, enjoy the games we love.

Peace and Love, RIP Mr. Iwata, you did an amazing job :) 3 </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The only way to win in war is not to play. I believe the game plays off this concept.

Lets play out the alternative, if you could choose be a "good guy" and not kill anyone wouldn't it detract from the experience?

Walk away cut to credits? A neat easter egg, but most players will take the bad route to see what happens.

Also, the game works best when you don't expect the guilt. Heaps of military games make you kill people thoughtlessly and this game is trying to trap people in that mindset and then turn it on them.

	<TEXT> House of Cards and Fallout 3 both have this really interesting tone with the use of Snare Drum and Horns, to evoke the feel of Washington DC. Captain America Winter Soldier also does this.

I was wondering if there was a term for it? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> He's basically a huge catalyst of events but does it all happen off screen? I thought PO would have him feature, but he wasn't in it at all, til the end, but he doesn't speak.

Am I missing something? Cos by Peace Walker snake and zero already are against each other. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm more worried that the message, what Metal Gear says about war (i.e. criticizing it), will be ignored in any future non-Kojima MGS titles, turning it into a gung-ho military propaganda piece :/ . 

Then again, I could be worrying pre-emptively, I'm sure there are other staff that "get" the series' core ideas </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I played through the whole 3D series just recently and didn't notice any of that. Canon isn't what I'm after in MGS, afterall, it's more fluid to me than most universes, so I'm willing to accept extreme twists. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Why, you can't enjoy a game because of it's politics? Not that I am saying this specifically is a "political" game. 

E.g. Metal Gear Solid is improved because of it's political ideas on the evils of war, for instance. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You saying I'm speaking for them :/ jeez, no. If anything I'm defending this game from being dismissed cos some people don't like outlets that happened to like the look of it. Seems unfair, and it's good to see such an interesting game come around now and then. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Is it reasonable for me to be worried that they might turn metal gear into a simplistic gung ho, jingoistic military series after he leaves?

Kojima's themes and the commentary on war (basically a systemic criticism of warfare, society and nuclear proliferation) was what made that series shine... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I see what you are saying but I believe the head dude making it is Iranian (lives in America?) I could be wrong, also those are some of the few movies with eastern people doesnt mean the portrayal will be the same because of the same actors.

I've been playing MGS recently and Venom Snake and Jack Bauer are two completely different characters being played by the same actor, as an example :) </TEXT>
