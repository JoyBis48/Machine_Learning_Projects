	<TEXT> By saying that it's not Islam related is just demonstrating how little you know about Islam. Islam decrees that any artifacts that predate Mohammed should be destroyed.  

I tried googling that but I found nothing. I will admit that my knowledge of Islam is not that of a scholar.

But I'll say this, if artifacts that predate Mohammed should be destroyed is truly a thing, and please cite as I couldn't find it, then during Mohammed's time, when he was alive, during the Abbasid and Umayyad Caliphates, then ancient sites that predated Mohammed would have ALREADY been destroyed.

	<TEXT> Ahhh, its part of maintaining their image as the protectors of Islam when in reality they are selling the loot to buy AK-47s.  And its working because the way people are viewing ISIS actions: not as looters that sell treasure and oil for AK47s  but as vandals that are destroying to protect religion.   Also, by skewing perception as Muslims are evil, their acceptance rate increases because westerners bully the Muslims causing them to leave and join ISIS.  

Edit: 
Its is plausable that meusium prices are catalogued thus you can't get very much because they are known about as a result easy to track. So they destroy them for propaganda. 

Also is it me or on their videos and pictures they are destroying bigger artifacts due to them being harder to smuggle?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Trust me its not Islam realated.  Religion is just a ruse for ISIS. Its all trickery not in the name of God but for Power. 

'"Conflict antiquities" are artifacts that are looted, smuggled and sold to illicit dealers around the world, with the proceeds going to fund military or paramilitary activity. Unesco estimates that globally trade in conflict antiquities could be worth more than $2.2 billion and growing as criminal groups recognize the value in very, very old things.'

"The Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), which has taken over large swathes of land in Iraq and Syria, is selling ancient Iraqi artifacts in the black market to finance its military operations in the region, Iraqi and Western officials said."
