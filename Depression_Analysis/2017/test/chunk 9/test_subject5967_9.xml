	<TEXT> Lately I've been biting off more than I can chew with the books I've been reading. I've been reading some dry nonfiction or very dense classics and haven't been getting much joy from it. 


I need an easy read that will remind me again why I love reading. I'm hesitant to say what books I like because I don't want you to overthink your recommendation. I'm just looking for something easy, not horribly long and a page-turner.  </TEXT>

Edit: Well, it's not #69, but I'll take a opposite field HR to break the 0-0 tie.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't need to tell any of you how important having a good lifting partner is and I was fortunate to have a great one for 11 years. Unfortunately, his health began declining rapidly in the last week. This morning, he entered Swolehalla. I'll continue to lift without him, but I like to think he'll be spotting me in spirit. 


Here's a picture I took of him right before he set a PR.

Trying to dress a bit nicer for work. I'm waiting on a pair of khaki chinos and another pair of olive chinos. In the meantime, I have these off white things. How does this outfit look?  </TEXT>

I bought this shirt to pair with khaki chinos to wear to work, but does it work with jeans? Could I wear this successfully to a bar?  </TEXT>

I'm really just looking for an opinion on these boots. Can they be worn with jeans and a button up shirt if I'm just going out to a bar with friends? Any other suggestions for making them work? I bought these a long time ago, but I'm not a big fan of black boots. I hate letting them just sit in my closet though.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> [This]( http://imgur.com/a/HIUPg) is what I wore this weekend for a wedding. First time I've had to dress formally since high school 4+ years ago. I probably won't have to dress formally again for awhile, so I didn't want to put out for a full suit, so I tried to duplicate [this look](http://imgur.com/IbMzgfd). Jacket is from Nordstrom Rack, shirt/tie/pants from a local store, shoes from Ross. Hair product is Murray's Pomade.  </TEXT>
