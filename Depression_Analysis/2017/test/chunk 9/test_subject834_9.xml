	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I know I post here a lot, and I usually post here about stuff that isn't exactly psychotic but related to schizophrenia, so sorry if it annoys anyone. 

Lately I've been feeling disconnected with the world, and especially with other people, I sometimes go to the store with my mum and stuff and it feels like everything is amplified (as in sounds and stuff) but everyone just feels alien to me. It kinda just feels like the world is passing me by, a good way to explain it is it's kinda like when you see people in movies and they're just standing there and everyone around them is going super fast, if you have ever seen that in a movie.

Has anyone else felt like this? It's pretty strange and I think the only other times I felt it was years ago during pre psychosis, and it may have happened during psychosis but I can't fully remember.

	<TEXT> I've been struggling with negative symptoms that I can fully recognize but not fully explain properly, life is pretty much difficult day to day. I pretty much just wake up, come on my computer and do that every day, all day unless I have an appointment. My words get mixed up quite a lot etc. you know, the normal stuff. I've been asking my parents to actually research or ask a doctor about schizophrenia to realize that it's pretty much not my fault, yet they don't, they think I'm just being lazy or stupid (they actually say that to me). I've been officially diagnosed btw, so they have no reason to doubt me yet they do. My memory sucks so when I forget things they just tut and say I'm acting stupid, key word, acting. I'm not acting shit, why would I act something for years that's done nothing but fuck with my life (mainly education). I feel like my parents are stigmatizing me in a way and it sucks, I have no one else to talk to and they're my main carers. It's really starting to get to me, it's like I have no real help with anything. At least they put me on disability, only time they recognized that I needed it.

I don't even know if this makes sense, hope it does.

Edit: When I talk about my parents I really mean my dad mainly. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Of course they're not the same but schizophrenia is a really, really bad illness when it comes to quality of life. Medications only fix the psychosis not the actually full illness, that's why they're called antipsychotics and not anti-schizophrenics. I've actually heard somewhere that a country(?) or a group of people want there to be some sort of assisted suicide for chronically schizophrenic people, not sure though.

Also, how long does it normally take to die from alzheimer's? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's SSRI's for depression. Antipsychotics are for schizophrenia and they block serotonin and dopamine. Depression and schizophrenia are different, when I think of insanity I usually think psychosis because psychosis is basically just the modern term for insanity. </TEXT>
