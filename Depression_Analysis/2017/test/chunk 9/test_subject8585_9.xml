	<TEXT> An American black female who was in my command when I was in the Navy jumped all over her white, blonde-haired, blue-eyed, male shipmate when he casually mentioned he was an African-American.  She couldn't grasp the difference between country of origin/nationality vs race.  She also went so far as to prevent another shipmate from listening to a radio program that she found offensive when she happened to drop by his work station.  Seems she didn't like it hearing Louis Farrahkan referred to as "Calypso Louie" by the black radio host, Ken Hamblin and no, she was not Muslim.  So much for protecting the Constitution and the rights of free speech!      </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2015-06-20 01:36:39 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> The prescription was for an opioid pain patch.  I used it for 1 week before I realized it was 7 months past its expiration date.  I don't think I suffered any ill affects and they, happily and apologetically replace the medication.  I'm not looking for a lawsuit/money but I'm concerned because this chain pharmacy has been caught and fined for selling expired OTC medication and food items in another state.  It may have been an honest mistake but because of their previous lawsuit and the fact it was a prescription drug that could have had serious consequences I feel I'm responsible to report it.    </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Back in the day when car bodies were made of metal my car battery died.  I didn't have any cables and nobody else did.  We were in a remote area.  I found an extension cord, split the two wires apart and stripped both ends of one wire.  Found a willing soul and we positioned the cars so that the bumpers touched to create a ground then, with both cars off, I clamped one bare end to the positive terminal from one battery then did the same with the other.  Started car one, let it run, then started mine.  Fired right up!  Can't do that anymore! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You're welcome.  The best advise I got from a cajun and chili-head is make sure every layer you add to a dish adds either flavor or texture.  For instance, instead of adding just water, even if you're just making Kraft Mac and Cheese, add chicken stock instead of water.  Add some of your spices at the beginning but leave some to throw in at the end.  For texture add some of your veggies from the beginning for aromatics but add additional toward the end for taste and texture.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As an old cook in the Navy I say job well done mate!  I like just a little glaze on mine so I can admire the rings of filling and golden brown rolls but that just my preference.  

I think your portioning was okay but doing it your way makes it hard to get a nice clean slice without "sealing" the cut edges.  This is one reason rolls will bolt up in the middle.                         Before you cut the rolls, refrigerate it covered in plastic for 15 minutes.  This firms up the dough and butter so it won't squish down and the filling doesn't squeeze out.  Using your handy dandy ruler mat as a guide and a very sharp long knife cut your rolls while using your other hand to gently maintain the shape of the roll.  Try not to end up with a  shaped roll but if you do just lightly lay it down and round it out.
Use a bigger pan.  Your rolls are too close together!  They should almost double in size with the second rising.  Also, when you originally roll the dough up, do so as loosely as you can.  That will allow the rolls to expand.  Roll it too tight and they won't proof correctly and can also cause the middle to bolt up.
Just some words of advise from an old salty cook.  Can't wait to see the next batch!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You can't "fry" using soy sauce since it contains no oil.  Simmer, boil or poach maybe but not fry.  Even butter has too much water to fry all though I heard of some that have used margarine however, since margarine is just one molecule away from being a plastic I wouldn't.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> True. Most homeowners/renters insurance covers loss of power usually up to $500.  Don't know if they would cover it because of a defective refrigerator though.  When I lost power for barely over 24 hours I called my insurance company.  They did not send an adjuster out, just began asking what I'd lost.  Rattled off a bunch of expensive cheeses, charcuterie, shellfish, all kinds of imported olives etc.  She asks if I'm a chef, "yes", I tell her and bingo, she awards me the full amount!  Pretty much just had the basics, less than $75.   I know, I'm bad. </TEXT>
