	<TEXT> As stated here before, hats / costumes for characters (Mario, Luigi, Link, Samus, Wario, Peach, DK, Diddy, Toad, Bowser, Mega Man, Meta Knight, King Dedede, Fox and Captain Falcon all seem like possibilities) would be cool.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Today was kind of sucky. My meds have been acting up, so school was utterly painful and made it difficult to do anything at all. I got to go looking for stuff to add to my birthday list, and finally got a chance to get out of the house again, so it's slowly improving. give323 </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The year is 20ChopChop. Everyone plays Villager at TAS levels of perfection. Because of this, the winner of a match depends solely on their gardening skills. The Smash Potato metagame has evolved to ridiculous levels due to it being the only remaining factor to decide matches.

The losers are executed, Game of Thrones style. There is no mercy in this town.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My family's been going through a rough patch lately, and I think it'd cheer my brother up if I could grab a Shulk for our personal collection. Amiibos have been helping both of us get through the worst of it by giving us something to do, like hunting stores and training them all, becoming better at Smash in the progress. Plus, it gives him figures of his favorite characters, so that's always an extra point. 

Good luck to everyone in the contest.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I feel like there should definitely be some sort of presence of some small-time villains, such as Abomination and Absorbing Man teaming up or something to go steal some stuff. However, I want her to encounter the Kree in battle at some point and make Korvac the big bad of the movie.  </TEXT>
