	<TEXT> Like a dairy cow, a pig uses its tail not only to shoo away insects but also to communicate. Like dogs, pigs wag their tails when they are happy, twitch them when they are nervous, let them drop straight down when they are sick. They may stick them straight out behind them when they are frightened or alarmed.

Pigs wag their tails when they are happy and content.

I would set up cameras to record the whole thing and tell people that I'm hoping to get feedback on the recipes and ask them what they thought about both. I think people's reactions would make for an interesting video. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Falafel with Avocado Cream   Tahini Mayo </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-07-13 18:58:59 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> [Final Result](http://i.imgur.com/wIuxb6p.jpg)

**Ingredients**

* 1 can chickpeas, reserving a small handful for the avocado cream (you can cook dried ones as well)
* 3 cloves garlic
* 1 small onion
* 2 teaspoons ground cumin
* A BIG bunch of both fresh parsley and coriander
* Salt and pepper
* 2 Tablespoons olive oil
* 3/4 cup chickpea flour (sometimes called gram flour)
* Burger buns and fresh tomato for serving

**For the avocado cream and tahini mayo**

* 1 avocado
* A small handful chickpeas left from can
* A bunch of fresh parsley
* 1 garlic clove
* 2 tablespoons tahini
* The juice of one lemon
* 2 tablespoons water

**Directions**

Throw your chickpeas, peeled garlic, onion, cumin and salt and pepper into a food processor and pulse until roughly blended. Youll need to scrape down the sides. Now add in the fresh herbs, oil and flour and blend until you have a nice thick texture, but it will still be fairly moist. Place into a bowl and if you need, add a little more flour to help the mixture bind as you form them into the patties. Make them small or big as you prefer. In a flat frying pan, heat about half an inch of oil over medium to high and add in your burgers. Cook for about 4 -5 minutes on both sides and once they are on their second turn, press them gently to make them flatter if you need. They should turn a nice dark, golden brown and smell divine!

For the avocado cream, simply add to your processor the avocado (without skin of course!), the remaining chickpeas, parsley and 1 garlic clove and blend until smooth. For the tahini mayo, drop the two tablespoons of tahini into a small bowl with the lemon juice and water and whisk with folk until you have a creamy consistency.

Toast the bun, add the burger, then the avocado, then a slice of tomato and finish with the oozy, lovely tahini mayo! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Good news! You actually don't need any nutrients from meat! You can live a happy and healthy life as a vegetarian!

According to the [American Dietetic Association](http://www.eatright.org/WorkArea//DownloadAsset.aspx?id=8417):

It is the position of the American Dietetic Association that appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases. Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence, and for athletes.

Similarly, the [British Dietetic Association](https://www.bda.uk.com/foodfacts/vegetarianfoodfacts) describes veganism as a type of vegetarian diet and continues:

Well planned vegetarian diets can be both nutritious and healthy. They have been associated with lower risks of heart disease, type 2 diabetes, obesity, certain types of cancer and lower blood cholesterol levels.

Well planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for all stages of life.

The position of the Australian Government's [National Health and Medical Research Council](http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/_files_nhmrc/publications/attachments/n55_australian_dietary_guidelines_130530.pdf) is that:

Appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthy and nutritionally
adequate. Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the lifecycle.

Finally the [Dietitians of Canada](http://www.dietitians.ca/Nutrition-Resources-A-Z/Factsheets/Vegetarian/Eating-Guidelines-for-Vegans.aspx) state:

A vegan eating pattern has many potential health benefits. They include lower rates of obesity, heart disease, high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes and certain types of cancer. Other benefits include lower blood cholesterol levels and a lower risk for gallstones and intestinal problems.

This eating pattern can take some extra planning. Vegans must make sure that enough nutrients like protein, iron, zinc, calcium, vitamins D and B12 and omega-3 fats are included.

A well planned vegan diet can meet all of these needs. It is safe and healthy for pregnant and breastfeeding women, babies, children, teens and seniors. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Animals suffer as individuals, not as a species. 

Imagine we lived in the world of the Matrix where humans were bred by the tens of billions to be used for energy. Our concern should be the well-being of humans as individuals, not the fact that we would go from a population of 50 billion humans down to a more reasonable 7 billion if we stopped humans from being bred excessively. 

Our concern for other animals ought to be the same. There is value in preserving biodiversity, but our primary concern should be for the well-being of the individuals. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> **[American Dietetic Association](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19562864)**

 It is the position of the American Dietetic Association that appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases. Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence, and for athletes.

**[Dietitians of Canada](http://www.dietitians.ca/Nutrition-Resources-A-Z/Factsheets/Vegetarian/Eating-Guidelines-for-Vegans.aspx)**

 A well planned vegan diet can meet all of these needs. It is safe and healthy for pregnant and breastfeeding women, babies, children, teens and seniors.

**[The British National Health Service](http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/Vegetarianhealth/Pages/Vegandiets.aspx)**

 With good planning and an understanding of what makes up a healthy, balanced vegan diet, you can get all the nutrients your body needs.

**[The British Nutrition Foundation](http://www.nutrition.org.uk/publications/briefingpapers/vegetarian-nutrition)**

 A well-planned, balanced vegetarian or vegan diet can be nutritionally adequate ... Studies of UK vegetarian and vegan children have revealed that their growth and development are within the normal range.

**[The Dietitians Association of Australia](http://daa.asn.au/for-the-public/smart-eating-for-you/nutrition-a-z/vegan-diets/)**

 Vegan diets are a type of vegetarian diet, where only plant-based foods are eaten. They differ to other vegetarian diets in that no animal products are usually consumed or used. Despite these restrictions, with good planning it is still possible to obtain all the nutrients required for good health on a vegan diet.

**[The United States Department of Agriculture](http://www.choosemyplate.gov/healthy-eating-tips/tips-for-vegetarian.html)**

 Vegetarian diets (*see context*) can meet all the recommendations for nutrients. The key is to consume a variety of foods and the right amount of foods to meet your calorie needs. Follow the food group recommendations for your age, sex, and activity level to get the right amount of food and the variety of foods needed for nutrient adequacy. Nutrients that vegetarians may need to focus on include protein, iron, calcium, zinc, and vitamin B12.

**[The National Health and Medical Research Council](http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/_files_nhmrc/publications/attachments/n55a_australian_dietary_guidelines_summary_130530.pdf)**

 Alternatives to animal foods include nuts, seeds, legumes, beans and tofu. For all Australians,
these foods increase dietary variety and can provide a valuable, affordable source of protein
and other nutrients found in meats. These foods are also particularly important for those who
follow vegetarian or vegan dietary patterns. Australians following a vegetarian diet can still meet nutrient requirements if energy needs are met and the appropriate number and variety of serves from the Five Food Groups are eaten throughout the day. For those eating a vegan diet, supplementation of B12 is recommended.

**[The Mayo Clinic](http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-living/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/vegetarian-diet/art-20046446)**

  A well-planned vegetarian diet (*see context*) can meet the needs of people of all ages, including children, teenagers, and pregnant or breast-feeding women. The key is to be aware of your nutritional needs so that you plan a diet that meets them.

**[The Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada](http://www.heartandstroke.com/site/c.ikIQLcMWJtE/b.3484249/k.2F6C/Healthy_living__Vegetarian_diets.htm)**

 Vegetarian diets (*see context*) can provide all the nutrients you need at any age, as well as some additional health benefits. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> **Ingredients**

* 1 15 oz can of black beans, rinsed and drained
* 1 cup cooked brown rice
* 3 cups roasted sweet potatoes, see recipe below
* 2 tablespoons chopped red onion
* 2 tablespoons chopped cilantro leaves
*  teaspoon salt
*  teaspoon cumin
*  teaspoon garlic powder
*  teaspoon smoked paprika
*  teaspoon paprika
* Olive oil, for cooking
* 6 hamburger buns
* Burger toppings of your choice
* Jalapeno, to taste

**Roasted Sweet Potatoes:**

* 3 cups diced sweet potatoes
* 1 teaspoon olive oil
*  teaspoon cumin
*  teaspoon paprika
*  teaspoon garlic powder
*  teaspoon salt
*  teaspoon pepper

**Curry Cilantro Mayo:**

* 1 cup Vegenaise or Just Mayo
* 1 and  teaspoons curry powder
* 2 - 3 tablespoons finely chopped cilantro leaves
* 2 teaspoons lemon juice
* 1 pinch of salt

**Instructions**

1. Make the mayo: add all of the mayo ingredients to a medium sized bowl and stir until combined. Set aside.

2. Pre-heat the oven to 375 degrees F. On a large sheet pan, place the diced sweet potatoes, olive oil, and all the spices. Toss until sweet potatoes are coated and place into the pre-heated oven. Roast for about 25 minutes, flipping once, or until sweet potatoes are fork tender. Let cool for a few minutes.

3. Place all of the veggie burger ingredients into a food processor and process for about 3 - 5 seconds until everything is mixed together but still has some texture to it. Form patties (you should get about 6 of them depending on the size you make) and place them on a parchment paper lined baking sheet. Chill in the refrigerator for about 20 minutes.

4. Heat a large pan over medium heat and coat the bottom with a thin layer of olive oil. Place burgers in the hot pan and cook for about 10 minutes, flipping once, until burgers are heated through.

5. If grilling the burgers, grill over medium heat and rub a little bit of olive oil on the grill to ensure that the burgers don't stick.

6. Top veggie burgers with curry cilantro mayo and enjoy on a bun with toppings of your choice! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Nothing you do can overcome all of the biases people will have against veganism. You can do some things to overcome a lot of it, but there is nothing you can do that will make everyone open to fairly considering what you have to say.

Appearance plays a big role in getting people to take you seriously. You will do much better if you have a clean haircut and decent clothes.

Another important aspect is to use as mainstream of sources as possible. Don't use Freelee as a banana girl as a source to support why you think vegan diets are healthy, reference the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.

Finally, act like you understand where people are coming from. You don't need to condone the consumption of animal products, but if you acknowledge people's experiences and beliefs they will be much more willing to hear you out. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Authority Nutrition is not an authority on nutrition.

**[American Dietetic Association](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19562864)**

 It is the position of the American Dietetic Association that appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases. Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence, and for athletes.

**[Dietitians of Canada](http://www.dietitians.ca/Nutrition-Resources-A-Z/Factsheets/Vegetarian/Eating-Guidelines-for-Vegans.aspx)**

 A well planned vegan diet can meet all of these needs. It is safe and healthy for pregnant and breastfeeding women, babies, children, teens and seniors.

**[The British National Health Service](http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/Vegetarianhealth/Pages/Vegandiets.aspx)**

 With good planning and an understanding of what makes up a healthy, balanced vegan diet, you can get all the nutrients your body needs.

**[The British Nutrition Foundation](http://www.nutrition.org.uk/publications/briefingpapers/vegetarian-nutrition)**

 A well-planned, balanced vegetarian or vegan diet can be nutritionally adequate ... Studies of UK vegetarian and vegan children have revealed that their growth and development are within the normal range.

**[The Dietitians Association of Australia](http://daa.asn.au/for-the-public/smart-eating-for-you/nutrition-a-z/vegan-diets/)**

 Vegan diets are a type of vegetarian diet, where only plant-based foods are eaten. They differ to other vegetarian diets in that no animal products are usually consumed or used. Despite these restrictions, with good planning it is still possible to obtain all the nutrients required for good health on a vegan diet.

**[The United States Department of Agriculture](http://www.choosemyplate.gov/healthy-eating-tips/tips-for-vegetarian.html)**

 Vegetarian diets (*see context*) can meet all the recommendations for nutrients. The key is to consume a variety of foods and the right amount of foods to meet your calorie needs. Follow the food group recommendations for your age, sex, and activity level to get the right amount of food and the variety of foods needed for nutrient adequacy. Nutrients that vegetarians may need to focus on include protein, iron, calcium, zinc, and vitamin B12.

**[The National Health and Medical Research Council](http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/_files_nhmrc/publications/attachments/n55a_australian_dietary_guidelines_summary_130530.pdf)**

 Alternatives to animal foods include nuts, seeds, legumes, beans and tofu. For all Australians,
these foods increase dietary variety and can provide a valuable, affordable source of protein
and other nutrients found in meats. These foods are also particularly important for those who
follow vegetarian or vegan dietary patterns. Australians following a vegetarian diet can still meet nutrient requirements if energy needs are met and the appropriate number and variety of serves from the Five Food Groups are eaten throughout the day. For those eating a vegan diet, supplementation of B12 is recommended.

**[The Mayo Clinic](http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-living/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/vegetarian-diet/art-20046446)**

  A well-planned vegetarian diet (*see context*) can meet the needs of people of all ages, including children, teenagers, and pregnant or breast-feeding women. The key is to be aware of your nutritional needs so that you plan a diet that meets them.

**[The Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada](http://www.heartandstroke.com/site/c.ikIQLcMWJtE/b.3484249/k.2F6C/Healthy_living__Vegetarian_diets.htm)**

 Vegetarian diets (*see context*) can provide all the nutrients you need at any age, as well as some additional health benefits. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Culture is not an excuse for animal abuse!

You're right that things done in our own cultures could be similarly described as animal abuse. We should work to end these things in our own culture, not simply excuse other cases of animal abuse because we haven't addressed every case yet. </TEXT>
