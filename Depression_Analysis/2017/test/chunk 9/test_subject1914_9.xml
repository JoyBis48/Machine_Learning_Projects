So I have a seagate 500gb hardrive that I used with a windows laptop. wanting to use this hardrive with a mac I tried to format it in Disk utility, However every time i try to Partition the hardrive. Or repair it. or erase it. it always comes up with an error saying 'File system formatter failed'.

So I think its a good comparison  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> i think it was an attempt to talk about an issue or is RDJ the only one allowed to talk about drug problems ? he's allowed to use it for positive 'i've turned it around publicity' but when its used for an agenda relating to a wider issue its not allowed, well since he's heard it a million times before maybe he should learn to act with a sense of dignity and decorum rather than confirming the primadona steroytype. I understand he gets personal questions a lot and it must be frustrating but it makes it worse if he gets it a lot and he acts this childish, have a sense of a workplace ethic, pretty embarrassing on RDJs part. 

What a joke.  </TEXT>
