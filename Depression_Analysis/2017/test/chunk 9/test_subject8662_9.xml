	<TEXT> I moved in with my best friend and his girlfriend last June, my first apartment outside of my parents house. It has not been... great. just typed the following in facebook chat: 
[Tue Apr 24 2012 12:15:14 AM] Verbal27: I feel like I'm going to vomit because I just ate most of a box of penne pasta. Why did I do this? Because I wanted spaghetti but I was out and I noticed [McDouche] and [Lady McDouche] had like 9 different boxes of the same three kinds of pasta, that they clearly kept forgetting that they bought already and kept re buying. So i thought of the snide remark [McDouche] would make upon finding some of his pasta consumed "See you got into the pene there, we were uh... actually lookin at maybe using that for dinner tonight." And I thought of the glee I would feel upon pointing out the hypocrisy and falseness of that statement. So I cooked, and I ate, beyond my capacity. In short, I just hate fucked a box of my former best friends pasta with my mouth
[Tue Apr 24 2012 12:21:58 AM] Verbal's friend: ...
[Tue Apr 24 2012 12:22:09 AM] Verbal's friend: Hate is a wonderful thing

Thinking it may be time to find a new living situation. What are some of your best "Weeelp, time to be hittin the ole dusty trail" stories? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's not exactly the same concept. I obviously have no intention of ever having anything to do with him again, but I have deeply emotional and personal memories with him that are all tainted now.

	<TITLE> Reddit, one of my best friends was sent to prison today for a horrific crime, and I'm not sure how to deal with it. How have you dealt with realizing people close to you are nothing like who you thought they were? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> In High School, my friend, we'll call him A (I don't give a fuck about his anonymity, you'll find out why in a second, but I do want to keep within guidelines) was the one person who was there for me by my side through everything. We met pretty soon after I transferred in my sophomore year, and were best of friends since then. He was like a brother to me and it's a stupid cliche but I would have taken a bullet for him. We had a bit of a falling out after I went to college and weren't as close but I still considered him one of my closest friends and we kept in touch until about midway through senior year. 

Late last year I found out why we fell out of touch, he was arrested on 16 counts of possessing and distributing child porn. He was sentenced last month to four years in jail, much to lenient in my opinion.

Reddit, I just can't reconcile this. He was a brother to me and all of a sudden he's this despicable piece of human filth. I can't stop hating him for this, when people around me are telling me he has a sickness and I should pity him. Have any of you had an experience like this where your image of someone was completely and irrevocably shattered. How did you reconcile the old experiences with the new person? Can you even?

TL;DR High school best friend turns out to be CP loving scumbad, can't figure out how to deal.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Just playing Devils advocate a little and this probably won't even be read. 
Also full disclosure, I may be biased because I had already pre ordered the special edition.

This is obviously a marketing strategy by ea and its kind of shitty but ea didn't make the game, bioware did. People who have been crafting this story through three games are the one who built these, and I trust that they wouldn't have anything taken out that was story essential, ala exiled prince or kasumi and zaed.

Just my thoughts but I could be very wrong. We'll see in 2 weeks.
