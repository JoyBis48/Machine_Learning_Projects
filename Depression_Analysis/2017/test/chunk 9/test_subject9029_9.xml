	<TEXT> And if the boss isn't an asshole? Do you see my point? People deserve privacy- even cheating assholes. I have a lot of swinger friends, and they keep it a secret because people are shitty and say shitty things like, "oh he/she must suck in bed, so that's why they have an open/swinging relationship". Having people find out about other peoples' private affairs, moral or immoral, is an inappropriate breach of privacy.  </TEXT>
