	<TEXT> Being a designer is pretty awesome. In the last three years, my professional activities as characterized by type of design are:

 * Content Design (content strategy, content marketing, etc)
 * Game Design
 * Graphic Design
 * Illustration
 * Industrial Design
 * Information Design (content audits, site maps, mock-ups, etc)
 * Media Design
 * Motion Design
 * Packaging Design
 * Product Design
 * Software Design (wireframing, user-centered design, etc)
 * Usability Design
 * User-Centered Design
 * User Experience Design (rapid prototyping, user flows, user scenarios, etc)
 * User Interface Design (user interaction, user-centric, etc)
 * Web Design (responsive web, typography, etc)

One of my favorite things about being a designer is the amount of new things there are to learn and old things there are to get better at. The best advice I can give is probably the same advice you can get for almost any career path, that is to never stop learning. 

As for getting work for your portfolio just make stuff. Do you have an idea you think would make a good app? Mock up some UI designs or some user flow charts. Interview a dozen people about a problem you think you can design a solution for and create a list of user needs, then go prototype out some solutions. You don't have to do client work to get a portfolio :)

Lastly it helps if you spend some free time honing your craft. Drawing every day really helps with so many aspects of the job for example.
