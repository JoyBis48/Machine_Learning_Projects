	<TEXT> Don't waste your time with greedy fucks like Autodesk. There software is hard to use and you will get an error even when you do the most simplest thing. He'll need experience with programming. Modo sucks ass. Start with blender, have him learn cycles rendering. Then, he should move to maya. If he's looking for games, use unity or cry engine. Unreal lags like hell. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Any advice for mocapping a dog? Should I go the old school way and just put one of my old mocap suits on her? Or is it possible to do it with an Xbox kinect? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Basically I have this cgi cyborg suit looking thing, and I need Brooklynn(The dog's name) to wear it. So, I'm gonna mocap her on set, take her mocap data into maya, animate the suit with the mocap data, and then bring the shot of the doge into AE plus the rendered shot of the cyborg suit and composite it onto the dog. 
  Is there any other efficient way to do this? Any tips? Has anyone ever mocapped a quadruped before?

	<TITLE> How do I add animation to enemy characters in Unity? It feels like no tutorial or script is working with Unity 5. Please help! I need the enemy to play a walking animation when his speed is greater than .1, and then go back to idle if his speed is less than .1! </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-06-15 06:07:17 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I added a float called speed, and added transitions using between the idle and walking animations. 
Didn't work. Added a component script 
using UnityEngine;
using System.Collections;

public class zombieWalk : MonoBehaviour {
protected Animator myAnimation;

void Start () {
 myAnimation = GetComponent ();
}

void Update () {
 myAnimation.SetFloat ("speed", Input.GetAxis ("Vertical"));
}
} 
  That didn't work. 
  Help! My levels look great. I've baked renders to image textures so my levels look like pre rendered vfx. My ai can navigate through the most treachorous paths. But then there's animations! Nothing works. Please help, I'm pretty desperate as you can tell.

	<TITLE> im getting beyond frustrated. I had a tutorial which said in order for animations to transition in mechanim, you are to set the conditions to speed. only in unity 5, in the conditions box, it says "Parameter does not exist." its almost as frustrating as using cryengine! </TITLE>

	<TEXT>   I've had enough. This has gone on forever. I will never be good enough. Plus my dad called me a dick and always yells. I find refuge in creating levels and unity 5. I bake textures in Blender cycles and then send it to unity so the graphics look like fucking Gravity. It's amazing. I thought my family would be proud. But no. My family said I spent too much time online, which I felt was a fucking erroneous assumption, since I only worked on the project for 30 minutes each day before going outside and trying to please everyone in track.
