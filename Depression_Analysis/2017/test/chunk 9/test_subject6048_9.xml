	<TEXT> If you're living with you're parents, move out and have them cut you off financially. Being independent and supporting yourself will be an immense source of newfound pride and freedom for you. Even if it sucks for a while and you don't like your job, it'll be worth it. You'll figure out what you like as you move forward. But like some of the other posters said on here, it's about moving in a direction, no matter what direction may be. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I can't recommend Rodney Yee's "Moving Toward Balance" enough.

I bought this book and started Yoga without any advice or direction and gained such a comprehensive and spiritual understanding of it. Reading this and exploring it on my own gave me a deeper perspective on it than friends that had been going to classes. He teaches you step by step with properly detailed photographs, but continually teaches you the philosophy behind this movement.

A few months after I had gotten into this, I talked one of my friends into doing the P90X Yoga video (an intense 90 minute workout). His mom stopped by while we were doing this and was very pleased, as she herself is a yoga instructor and enthusiast. She went into her office to grab "the perfect book for him", and to my delight it was "Moving Toward Balance".

	<TEXT> As a noob, you might as well be throwing your money on the roullete table. That's fine, as long as you're willing to lose it. This is coming from someone who's in the same boat as you, complete noob until about 6 months ago. The best way to learn is by doing though. If you have an iphone, I'd suggest the app RobinHood as there are no transaction fees, though it is quite restrictive in the moves you can make. 

Just keep in mind you're probably going to lose a substantial amount of whatever you put in. As many in this community will tell you, unless you can do a top down evaluation of the company and rationalize what you're buy/selling, then all you're doing is gambling. </TEXT>

Also I've found exercising affects me positively incredibly on my psyche. Don't know if this is something you already do, but regular weight lifting/running has been the greatest aid for me.

You're 100% on the right path, encourage yourself. To put things in perspective, there's many people that go there entire lives having the issues you've mentioned but never take any steps to improve upon them.  </TEXT>
