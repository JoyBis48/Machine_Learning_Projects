	<TEXT> Yea exactly. And I had hulu for a while but like netflix more. The newer shows on hulu offset the commercials because it is cheaper than cable and the commercials are shorter. You have some control on commercials. 

I get it when people complain about "paying for commercials" but hulu is the lesser evil between cable and itself. Assuming you dont also have cable.  </TEXT>

Yea he occasionally reposts, but for the most part its crossposts and original stuff. And he interacts with reddit and spreads content. I would honestly be less entertained by reddit if he and other linkers werent here.

	<TEXT> Cant find the video that im thinking of, but he got a call from a telemarketer and set them up saying the account holder had to talk to him and it would come to the phone in a sec. He then muted him, and called a scammer. Told the scammer a similar story but gave the other guys name. Then said to both of them "ok here he is" and switched them onto each other. 

They introduced each other and then talked about "the account" for a couple minutes before one was like "why are asking me all this" then the other guy was like "you called me."
After a couple "nuh uh you"'s they fought and hung up.

	<TEXT> just hire some undergrad English student to proofread.  

Yea at the minimum wage of whatever country that kid works in? 

And offering free stuff to do it or opening up the doors to anyone to edit it allows the possibility of vandalism. Think of wikipedia and how often it is vandalized. The power of wikipedia is that there are millions of users that quickly correct or revert things, usually within minutes or hours. What you are proposing doesnt have any checks in place. 

Imagine if reddit wrote a manual. We would add a bunch of inside jokes and easter eggs and trolls and how would the manufacturers know? They already suck at english as you said, so how would they know to correct vandalism.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The general idea is you bring in something valuable and they hold it for you to let you borrow money.  After some time you can come back and "buy" your thing back for what they borrowed plus some fee. Normally people want their shit back and pay. That is a self supporting business model if everyone came to get their shit back.

But when people dont get their shit back because they can't afford it or dont want it, then the shop will sell it. Usually at enough of a markup to regain the loan money, fees, and price of storage. Yea its not a lot of profit they make, but it is enough that there are so many pawn shops springing up. The other way is that the person will explicitly say they dont want it back, then the shop will buy it for less in an attempt to maximize potential profits. 

What you have to realize is that once they have a shop, storing one extra piece isnt all that much more cost. Once they are able to cover rent/mortgage costs, they can store as much as will fit in the shop without extra cost. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> None. The human aspect messes it up. But being such a human thing, we need to make the best of it and try to change our governments for the good in the best ways we are able. 

Every form of government works with the right checks and controls, with the right people,  and in the right time. 

There is no "best" government, not because they are all bad, but because they are all good in the right circumstance. 

We can find perfect governments on paper that fail in real life and we can find terrible things on paper that work in real life. And of course, we can find anecdotes that support either cause. Socialism can work in real life the same way that capitalistic democracies can fail in real life. Humans are too unpredictable to choose a "best" government and so each instantiation of each form of government should be treated individually as its own case, not with these blanket statements. 

Theres a reason this is its own (large) field of study. It wouldnt be if it really could be summed up in a single reddit rant.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Your body plays with legos. And it has a set of plans for legos called dna. Well, every now and then it will rebuild a part of you to keep you up to date. But sometimes it accidentally copies something wrong. Scientists call that a mutation. Sometimes that mutation will grow uncontrollably and do some nasty stuff like take resources fron the good cells. 

This does really bad things to your body. 

Thats the best eli5 I got and disclaimer that I am not a scientist.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The video said "the researchers captured the footage through high-resolution 3D time-lapse multi-colour imaging, making use of both spinning disk confocal microscopy and lattice light sheet microscopy. These techniques involves capturing slices through an object and stitching them together to provide final 3D images across the whole cell."
