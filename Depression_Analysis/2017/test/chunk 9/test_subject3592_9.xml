	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Today at work, I was doing fine till the afternoon when I messaged her.

I knew it was over. I could feel it. Today, the depression would hit me. It had been a few months. No. Almost a year. But I could see the snowflake falling in my head. I could see its trajectory, and I could see the avalanche that it would cause.

I had to be really careful. I'd escaped before. I just had to keep focused on work. Fuck. Why wasn't she replying? 

*Those are the kind of thoughts that will lead you down the path. Focus on the work. Get the job done*

Had she replied? I checked my phone and got a beer. Maybe the beer would help. I drank it quickly. Nope. Bad idea.

I needed to get out of there. I decided to walk home, but then saw the bus and got on instead. 

When i got off the bus, I felt afraid of the evening that lay ahead. It was less than a block that I had to walk. Each step increased my dread. I'd never, ever felt this before. I knew that I would go home and burst into tears. Nothing would stop it now. Except if I didn't go home.

Yes, that was it. I just had to take a walk. The thought was there, but I kept moving towards my house. I felt like I was a chained by my hands and was being dragged along the floor. I helplessly watched my legs carry me up the stairs. 

I methodically checked my mail, unlocked the door, put my keys and badge in their place, locked the door, took off my shoes, went into my bedroom, covered myself with my blanket and burst into tears. They flowed peacefully and silently, accompanied only by the sound of my refrigerator humming. I should have gotten that fixed long back.

I stopped crying, got up and decided to write this.

The rest of the evening beckons, and I have to go. Thank you for reading. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Android developers: How do you accurately test the battery usage of your app? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-06-18 18:49:28 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hey guys..I'm developing an app for Android that can play local media (just for learning) and I was wondering how the battery usage of apps is commonly tested. How do you guys test the battery usage of your app? 

Like, if I wanted a script that would launch a video for an hour and see how my app is doing...what would I need to know to write such a script?

Also, I've been told that battery percentage isn't really an accurate descriptor of the battery usage...why is that? Is it because it drops due to every other app and Wifi and data usage and all that? If not battery percentage, what would I be using to see how my app eats up the battery? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> How do I deal with a friend just diagnosed with depression? </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hey guys,

I spent a bunch of the last 3-4 years in a depressed state, but told very few people, and now I'm on one of the upswings. But this isn't about me..

Recently, a very close friend of mine was diagnosed with depression due to Iron deficiency in her diet. The feelings she talked about briefly, I understand only too well...and of course, I want to help

But the problem is, I remember when I was feeling similar things, I really, REALLY didn't want help from other people...I could hardly bear talking to anyone else...and I think she's the same...since she's been hardly talking the last few weeks...I've tried to let her know that I'm there for her if she wants to talk...and I've tried to make conversation normally as well..but I really want to get through to her...that she's not alone in this.

I just don't know how...especially since I can remember a time when no one could get through to me..

Any ideas?

	<TEXT> Not really. The India Pakistan split was a complicated issue. In fact, India has more Muslims than Pakistan. Our previous president was muslim as well.

Not that doesn't mean India is completely secular. Narendra Modi in particular and his party in general are known to be communal. He is widely thought to have had a hand in major communal riots in 2002 where a lot of Muslims were killed. But again, been that is a gray area.

Sorry for not being able to give a concrete answer...but that's India for you. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you're prepared to add a day or two to your trip, you can go camp out in the Whitney area and look for permits every day. A lot of people apply for the lottery and cancel/never show up/show up in smaller groups than planned.

A ranger told me he's always had a few walk-in permits issues...every  day when the visitor center opens. Just go for it! 

Also, you can climb one of the "lesser" mountains. 

I had way more fun on Mt. Dade than on Mt. Whitney. Even though I didn't even reach the top of Dade. Whitney was so much easier, crowded and less fun overall. Though the views are great. </TEXT>

The only reason for Logician 1 (and 2) to say "I don't know" to the bartender's question is that he/she wants a beer, but doesn't know about the other two. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I had long heard rumors about the Fade on OKCupid, but could never have guessed that my own self would experience the phenomenon. They had said that one day, communication would cease. Abruptly. Leaving thoughts and words and plans hanging in the air. Even dreams, if you're romantically inclined. 

It was everything that had been said, and more. It was a fleeting glimpse of a better place. Before I could make out any details of this magical kingdom, it was replaced by the familiar grayness of our cloudy, daily existence. I could no longer deny the existence of the Fade. I could only move on. 

It reminded me of knights in medieval times. A beautiful lady drops a handkerchief on the road and smiles at a knight. He smiles back, dismounts from his steed and picks it up. He runs up the old (perhaps new, in the time of the knight) staircase to the balcony, but there's no one there. "Was it all a dream?", he wonders. He looks at his hand, and the question is answered. For the handkerchief is still there.

Third post (this one): What do I do after my first date?

It seems like I'm growing with this sub!

I had two OKC dates last week (I am 29/M), but this is really the first time I've been actually dating. Everything before came out of already-existing friendships.

The dates went okay. We talked a lot, laughed a decent amount and went home feeling warmish inside (well me, at least).

Now I'm texting back and forth, but it seems like I'm going nowhere with this. It's all "what are you up to?" and "hahaha that was hilarious". How do I make my interest clear? Or do I wait for a second date? 

No idea what to do. Please to help, the experienced peoples of the Reddit!

EDIT: Had both genders listed for myself. I'm only one -- male. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This might be a cultural thing (Indian here), or a nerd thing (engineer), or something (shy). But I've never been in the dating game prior to two months back. 

It's not like I have dates lined up or anything. My OKC ritual usually goes like this: I get 1/10 replies. After a thread lasting about 6 messages, she stops replying.

But in theory, suppose I had to choose between two (or more..it's theory!) girls after date(s) with both of them. Is this acceptable (just saying No to one of them)...in the OKC culture?

I'm sure girls face this issue quite a bit on OKC...since all the guys are green, and all the girls are red :D </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hello people,

I'm hiking through Buckskin Gulch next weekend and wanted to know (from people who've done the hike) whether sandals are enough.

From what I see, it's mostly walking with a little scrambling, for which I don't want to carry my big, heavy hiking boots.

Anyone with experience in the Canyon, please chime in!

	<TEXT> Yup, you're right in that we both were partly right :) 

I found this: http://www.physics.princeton.edu/~mcdonald/examples/bernoulli.pdf

So the car pressure is *higher* than outside, and net-airflow is actually **outwards**! Of course, because there's air coming in through the vents. Cool stuff.

Also, a hole in the windshield is the "same" as a window, because air is flowing attached to the car surface and not straight into the car. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Actually air flows out of the bottle, not into it. Also imagine an aeroplane door cracking open in midflight. Everything flows out, not in. The air outside is moving relative to the car, so actually the air outside is the air with the lower pressure. Just like in a wind tunnel.

Barometric equilibrium is of course true. But how? Why...what if you open the window just a tiny bit? Is air still flowing both in and out of there? Because sure as hell, if you put your hands in the gap, you're going to feel air flowing in.

EDIT: In fact, what happens if all your windows are closed and there's a (say big) hole in the front windshield? Where's the air flowing out of then? I think there's some big thing I'm missing...and it's not just that air is flowing out of an undefined place. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Relative to the car, the air inside the car is at rest, right? So it's pressure 
is the same as when it started, which is atmospheric pressure.

So you mean, part of the window has inflowing air and part of it has outflowing air? Which parts have inflow and which have outflow? Like I said, try this in a moving car...you really can't find a region with outflowing air.

Also, if the pressure inside is *actually* lower, why is air flowing out?

	<TEXT> I was asked this puzzle a few weeks back and couldn't figure it out.

You're moving in a car, and you roll down the windows. Air flows into the car. 

1. Why does air flow in? Air inside is at atmospheric pressure, air outside is at atmospheric pressure. Pressure being equal, there should be no flow.

2. Obviously it's flowing out from somewhere, otherwise pressure would build up in the car and it would explode. Where does it go out of? This was asked to me when inside a moving car, and I placed my hand at various locations around the window and air seemed to be coming inside everywhere!

	<TEXT> We don't really consider molecules while talking about the propagation of sound. The assumption is that they collide frequently enough with each other that statistically speaking, the pressure distribution is continuous. That's what the continuum assumption means. 

Increasing amplitude of (pressure) oscillations is the same as increasing the loudness of the sound, so yes...It would work in relation to your ear. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Theoretically, the speed of sound is a function of $\gamma$, $P$ (pressure) and $\rho$ (density)... 

Basically, as the density approaches zero, the speed of sound becomes undefined, i.e. there's no air for the sound to travel through. Theoretically though, however rarefied the air is, sound can still travel.

However, when I say theoretically, I mean in the theory of compressible flow, which assumes that air is a continuum. This assumption is valid for quite a while.

At the point where air cannot be treated as a continuum and molecules are too far to collide with each other (but still close enough for non-zero density), sound can't travel. When there is zero pressure, the speed of sound is zero.

However, whether you can *hear* sound in these cases is a completely different question, because that depends on whether your ear drum can detect the pressure variations and oscillations.

**tl;dr**: Pressure goes to zero, sound can't travel. Density goes to zero, nothing for sound to travel in. Molecular and/or viscous effects can/may do other things that I don't know (but hopefully someone does!)

	<TEXT> I'm sure the African people have their own systems of counting and learning. Just because it's different from western theory doesn't mean it's magical. The africans work just as hard and take just as much time to learn their rhythms. And they have their own version of "polyrhythms" and theory as well.

I kind of relate to it since Indian music is similar. Polyrhythms start very, very early when learning indian percussion and are never really regarded with the same sort of amazement as they are in western music. Really cool stuff. 

Also, Bela Fleck is awesome :) </TEXT>

The classical music is derived from the same base in both countries. Which is not surprising, considering the style of music is from before the countries split up.

In fact, there is a greater divide between North Indian and South Indian music than between North Indian and Pakistani music. </TEXT>
