	<TEXT> I have the entire To The Moon soundtrack. I know what song you're talking about. This is just a soundtrack-oriented release. Only certain parts of the song are used, and the in-game version will be mixed differently with slightly higher BPM. The parts I do use loop nicely without fading out and/or starting back up again after ending.

All things considered, I understand the redundant criticisms I've gotten so far. And if you would play the game and hear it within its context, it would make more sense. But, soundcloud, for me anyway, is only meant for the soundtrack-oriented releases of the music.

This is why I really wish Reddit wasn't either a Link or Text agenda. I really wish I could leave a link and still have text without having it put it into a comment that is likely to be buried underneath the dribble. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I wouldn't want Apple doing anything like this until all of their base models include GPUs. I don't see anybody spending 2k on a mac just to make sure it has a proper GPU in it. Unless they just took off with a new series of machines dedicated to the necessities of gaming where pixels need to be pushed out quickly. Right now, the GPUs Apple puts in are better for accurate pictures, but not fast pictures. And that's the big reason Apple still has this crude separation from gaming.

But, it's not impossible, and probably not even far-fetched in any means. Swift is now open source and is good for developing apps on a lot of platforms. So maybe this will bring a huge streamline to cross-platform development when it comes to which platform is getting all the games. People have developed for Windows purely because it was popular and re-developing for Mac required having a mac + some special software. With Swift going open source, this could be the huge gateway to get one language to code for everything so devs only spend a little more time making a new version to reach millions of more potential customers.

It's a dream. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In Nintendo's Defense, anything before the Wii wasn't a gimmick with controls. DS seemed like pure gimmick, but it something that definitely works when executed correctly. So I wouldn't can that just another Gimmick. And let's be glad the 3DS isn't just a DSi with a 3D screen, but a very competent handheld with extremely fun games to play. Yeah, yeah, low res, whatever, still way too much fun on one handheld. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Wow. You're equating Amiibo to a store-specific preorder costume? Apples to oranges dude. Anyone can get an Amiibo, not everyone can get a pre-order. Not only that, but you're paying once for a figure that can unlock content in multiple games or claim daily rewards for some games. Not the same as other companies doing on-disc DLC.

And people are very right when they say the content is NEVER significant to say you're not enjoying a full game. If Amiibo was used to lock content such as extra levels or important items that could help you complete the game, then it would be a problem. But, even without the game, you have a decorative and collectable figure on your shelves. Other DLC does not give you anything like that. If a new game comes out with on-disc DLC, you gotta buy it. And if that DLC stops being supported, then you're fucked. If a new game comes out with Amiibo support, and you already have the Amiibo, then you're already bought that content. And it will never stopped being supported since you don't have to download it.

Amiibo-specific content being on the disc makes sense for this reason. If the game had to download content or checked a server every time an Amiibo was tapped, it would get very annoying very fast.

Nintendo did it much differently. The concept may be similar, but at least they did it in a fun and enjoyable way. And not buying Amiibo does not stop you from enjoying any game's main content.

Some people see it that way. But let me make it clear that **Nintendo is not getting a free pass for anything.** we still hate how hard to get they are. The price is pretty steep if you only want 1 Amiibo to use in 1 game for 1 time. Some of the content isn't worth an Amiibo you don't already have. And yes, it does suck that there isn't a way to access to content without one. But asking for that would be like saying developers should make all DLC unlock able so we can all play it for free. And those who paid simply didn't want to work to unlock it. It'd be a bad business model if nobody had to buy an Amiibo.

Nintendo had to sell some, and they weren't just going to let everyone have everything for free. So everyone can take their hate for Amiibo and shove it up their ass. If you're complaining about them not being abundant or available, I understand. But just hating on it because you see it as insignificant in-disc DLC enablers, then just stfu. We get it. </TEXT>

Feel free to hit me up if you'd ever like to discuss the game. And, I think there is a position to increase your overall stamina. There are a few ocarina cheat codes that I deal make the game more enjoyable with actually cheating at anything. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I only ask because I'm trying to breed a shiny Audino and read that using a foreign pokemon with a non-foreign pokemon to breed yields the biggest chance for breeding one. Believe me, I don't want to hatch 8,000 eggs before I hatch a shiny.

But I'm only on Pokemon Black. As far as I'm concerned, /r/pokemontrades is meant for generation VI.

How could I possibly get my hands on a foreign Audino when nobody I know has a foreign version of the game/foreign DS? I can't, right? I'm in Southern California, and it flourishes with pokemon players, but not people on Gen V who play non-English copies.

Am I pretty much screwed? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, I had to educate my girlfriend's parents about scams like this. It's impossible for some random company to see a virus on your computer. If they do see it, then they're looking at your computer's files and information without your knowledge and permission witch is a cyber crime. If anyone calls saying they see a virus on your computer, then it's fake. And they actually had paid around $80 to install some **fix** which was just spying software. I had to remove it and tell them they were scammed and to cancel their current credit cards just to be safe. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Mostly, the operating system and is ecosystem. They are very tight knit. Instead of having some stuff picked out and made by one company and another company making changes and/or addons that are hot and miss, Apple is very strict about how they go about getting the product to you. They make the operating system and design it for the hardware that they themselves have handpicked. It's like putting two and two together to make for by one person who knows the math. The other side is like someone making  a two and then buying a fraction he thinks is equal to two.

I really like the feel of the operating system. And the parts in the computer are not just fast but stable. I would sacrifice 20% of speed for maximum stability any day.

And many people claim it is entirely out of the lack of popularity, but I disagree. Unix and Linux are simply built with security deeper in mind than Windows ever was. The fact that Mac was built off of a core that had networking and specurity as priority is a big peace of mind. Apple on paper and in practice had proven to be less vulnerable. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Summoning of Chimeratech Fortress Dragon cannot be done during the battle phase as it is a fusion summon that can only happen during your own Main Phase. If it was something that can be done at any time, then it would be broken against Machine decks or even with DNA surgery. With DNA surgery, you would change everything to Machine-type monsters and simply tribute every monster on the field for Chimeratech Fortress dragon whenever you wanted (assuming there is a Cyber Dragon in play).

If Chimeratech's text said you can do it during the Battle Phase, or if it required the effect of a quick-play spell card, then it would have been alright. </TEXT>
