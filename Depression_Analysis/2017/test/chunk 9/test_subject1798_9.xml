32 = 8 x 4 = 2 x 4 x 4 = 2 x 2 x 2 x 4 = 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 = 2^5

	<TEXT>  the study clearly states that gun ownership is not a risk factor for homicide, merely for method of homicide.

In table 4 the researchers found that gun ownership increased your risk of homicide 2.7X. Also from the article (bolding is mine):

 Despite the widely held belief that guns are effective for protection, **our results suggest that they actually pose a substantial threat to members of the household.** People who keep guns in their homes appear to be at greater risk of homicide in the home than people who do not. Most of this risk is due to a substantially greater risk of homicide at the hands of a family member or intimate acquaintance. We did not find evidence of a protective effect of keeping a gun in the home, even in the small subgroup of cases that involved forced entry. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have to correct your quotation.

The full quote is this:
  "Gun ownership was most strongly associated with homicide at the hands of a family member or intimate acquaintance. Guns were not significantly linked to an increased risk of homicide by acquaintances, unidentified intruders, or strangers.

Meaning:  The people who knew that the guns were at home and where they were located were the ones who used the weapons in the homicide.

I am listening and I appreciate the conversation. The title says that gun ownership was one of the "significant factors" but did not say anything about causality. It could be that the same people who tend to have guns at home may also be prone to other risky behavior. The researchers also admitted this may be the case and that it was difficult to ascertain the effect. I think further study is warranted and it was unfortunate that Congress put the kibosh on it and it still has a chill to this day.

Really, thanks for the civil conversation. It's refreshing to be able to discuss a difficult subject in this way. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  1) The topic of the study was completely outside of the purview of the agency.

I think that one of the missions of the CDC is studying injury and violence. If you go to cdc.gov and click on "More Topics" right at the top, you'll see "Injury, violence   safety." Click on it and you'll see a sub-category, "Violence prevention." Click on "About Us" in that division's page and you'll find this:

*Violence is a significant problem in the United States (U.S.). From infants to the elderly, it affects people in all stages of life. In 2012, 16,688 people died as a result of homicide and 40,600 took their own life.*

Why wouldn't you want a government agency studying the risk factors of homicide/suicide/domestic violence, etc? I think it's an important area of study.

 2) The study was performed on data that was artificially limited, in order to produce the pre-ordained result.

The study itself was limited in scope to a statistical study of the effect of gun ownership on the rate of in-home homicide, hence the data was limited to what was within the parameters of the study. The result is the result. 2+2=4; that's not pre-ordained, it just is.

 3) The study was ordered for political reasons in order to support a position, rather than to determine accurate results.

Even if this were true, it's mostly irrelevant. If any study were politically ordered, it should signal that you should be extra careful in evaluating the results but it doesn't mean the results are invalid. What matters is whether the study itself was based on bad data or its methodology was flawed (e.g. the results were manipulated). Nobody has been able to show either of these. On the flipside, the criticism of the study is politically motivated. Does that make the criticism any less valid? Of course not, as long as the critiques have a basis in fact and are not merely unsupported opinion. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Even if you assume a political motivation, the results are still valid if the data was good and the methodology was good. There are numerous studies in front of regulatory boards and Congress that were funded by industry or special interests. The reason why firearms are the focus of this CDC study is because they are often purchased for protection and the researchers studied whether the risks statistically outweighed the benefits. Like anything else, decisions should be made with the totality of the body of evidence, not by any single study. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I read the entire reason.com article and didn't find any passage that actually tried to show that the CDC's data or methods were wrong or that it was "biased research." It may be because the article appeared in the New England Journal of Medicine after quite a bit of peer review. Your article did offer a lot of political verbiage (i.e. opinions) and cited other studies, which is fine, but it's hardly a scientific rebuttal.

It also criticized the CDC for not studying accidental deaths when it was outside the stated scope of the research. It's like criticising somebody for not test driving Ferraris when they're out shopping for a family car. That's just a silly criticism.

	<TEXT> I agree for print but I agree with @jedrekk that many serif fonts don't look great on standard resolution monitors below 12pt. Agree that Georgia is an exception and it does indeed look good on the screen, much better than Times New Roman. I would love to see Georgia used more widely when there is a lot of body copy. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It can be stressful for many people to not be able to rely on a steady paycheck. I'm self-employed but it's definitely not for everybody. You have to spend a lot of (unpaid) time marketing yourself and looking for projects. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> x-post from /r/web_design: TIL Helvetica was not intended to be used as a body text font. Haas, the same house that produced Helvetica, created the Unica font to be more legible in smaller text sizes. </TITLE>

	<TEXT> It was designed to be used in small amounts in headlines and advertisements when hot metal typesetting was being used. In small sizes its uniformity makes the text harder to read so it didn't translate well into phototypesetting (and by extension, desktop publishing and web design). Haas, the design house which produced Helvetica, designed a new typeface for phototypesetting called [Haas Unica.](http://www.mengelt-blauen.ch/Typefaces/HaasUnicaPrint.jpg) Unfortunately It was released at a time when phototypesetting was being obsoleted by desktop publishing and thus didn't get the attention it deserved.

Claimant:  "I am Superman."

Me:  "I don't believe you."

	<TEXT> There is way more variation between professors at a school than between schools.

University is a very different environment than high school. You will meet fellow students who are driven and motivated and they will sort of pull you along (and you will pull them along). All the students are in the same boat, so to speak. Don't think that your high school friends are the only ones you will have. It's highly unlikely you'll still have close relationships with them by your 4th year, even if you go to UCSD. College is the time you all start going your own way. </TEXT>
