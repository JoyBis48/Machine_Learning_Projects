	<TEXT> For some reason, despite the fact I do tons of offers (I'd estimate If I actually got all the Swagbucks they said I would get then I'd have something like 2000 more swag bucks), none of them seem to actually give me swagbucks. For instance, I go to the offers page click on something that says (roughly) "Sign up for X brand gift card!" - 50 SB. I follow the link, signup for the card and provide all my information, and then do a ton of surveys before getting to the end, checking my balance and 90% not seeing it change. Is there a reason? Is anyone else experiencing this? Sorry if this is kinda ranty but it really frustrates me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Maybe an event that fires a hundred or so years after the  initial invasion where the Inca go to war with the Aztec's over in the Americas, this diverts a large amount of European levies to America and allows for European countries to strike back and regain lost ground. (Basically it just nukes their levies for a few years) This could occur repeatedly until the Aztec are knocked all the way out of Europe. </TEXT>
