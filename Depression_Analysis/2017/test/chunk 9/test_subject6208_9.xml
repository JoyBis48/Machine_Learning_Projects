And if it weren't for Xmen, I'd say Nicholas Hoult.

But if we're talking about more realistic choices, I agree with those saying Logan Lerman. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm writing, or at least trying to, a story that takes place entirely in the woods and with only one character. How would you go about developing the character, defining who they are, and showing an arc?

Internal monologue wouldn't fit with the story and talking out loud seems clunky. Can I make it work?

Does a character need to be developed or have an arc for the story to be good?

Help? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> I know this has been asked rather frequently here, but is there anyone here that would be interested in scoring a 15 minute short I made? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-02-08 01:37:39 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I recently just finished editing a short film I spent 7 months on. I'd love to have it be a 100 percent original film, so I'm looking for someone who'd be interested in scoring it.

I'm going to just put it out there so I don't waste anyone's time: I don't have money. This has been a passion project of mine that some friends were kind enough to help me with. I'm not saying that I expect someone to score it for free, but if I did pay someone, it wouldn't be a lot purely because I just *don't* have a lot.

Now that that's out there, let me tell you about the film. It's a small scale crime story about a cop bringing down two criminals. It's heavily inspired by classic film noir, but takes place in the modern day setting. It also takes a somewhat existential look at death.

I really could see some drone/ambient music fitting it well. But I'm not experienced in music, so I'm open to anything really.

I've done music for my own shorts before, but they're never good, so I'd love to have someone who actually knows something about music do the score.

If this isn't a good place for this post, could someone point me in the direction of a more proper subreddit?

Thank you so much! </TEXT>

/r/FirstTitleThenStory is another kind of writing prompt subreddit I made where instead of a traditional prompt, the prompt is just a title. Nothing else. No other information. I thought it'd be an interesting experiment.

Is this something anyone would like? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey everyone! This is a subreddit where someone submits a "title" and people will reply with a story based off of that title! The idea behind this is to allow users to get even more creative!

Think of it as a writing prompt, but instead of a synopsis, all you have to go off of is a title. No genre, no style, no nothing.

Let me know if you have any questions or ways to improve this place!

Hopefully this will be a fun thing that will survive!

Edit: I'll post a title a day until the sub grows a bit. Hopefully it will! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think for me the reason I tend to get a steelbook over a normal one is because I see movies as works of art, so I think the cover art should reflect that. I don't just want my collection to be good. I want it to *look* good as well. I personally think most movies have terrible or generic cover art so that it's easier for them to sell, which is understandable. They have to make money.  I also think the blue cases throw off some good cover art.

Most steelbooks I come across have more interesting artwork and can get away with being more abstract so that's what's appealing about them to me. But if the steelbook art looks the same as the regular art, then I'll just go with the regular one since it'll be cheaper usually. And in some cases, the steelbook will have worse art. Like [these](http://i0.wp.com/www.pissedoffgeek.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/breaking-bad-steadman.jpg?resize=752%2C619) Breaking Bad ones. Sure, they're interesting, but I jus think they don't look good.

But that's the thing, it's all just preference. 

I'd have to say for me personally, it's steelslipcoverregular blu

But you're not idiotic for not liking steels. It's just a preference, man! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, I mean, 1999 was like 15 years ago and 1990 was like 25 years ago. A lot has changed in cinema since then. A lot of advancements in technique and technology. It's perfectly reasonable to assume most movies of the 90s haven't stood the test of time. If you're someone who was born in the 70s, then the 90s probably don't feel old. But if you're someone who was born in the late 90s, that was an entire lifetime ago.

I don't consider the 90s "old" but it *was* over a decade ago. Heck, 1990 was a quarter of a century ago! It sounds old when you say it like that! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I dunno. I was thinking about it, and I'm not entirely sure it fits what I'm looking for. The thing about LNS, and I won't spoil anything, is that, while there *is* a character that isn't who they say they are, it doesn't really play on this. LNS doesn't really show you-know-who's character as a mysterious one, they just use flat out misdirection, which I don't think is the same thing.

The thing about the movies I used as examples, The Guest and Stoker, is that they don't misdirect you into believing the character's are something opposite of what they really are. Instead, they leave their backstories vague and almost breadcrumb-like hints about the true nature of their characters. In fact, right from the get go you feel something is off about the characters.

LNS, on the other hand, leaves you no hints to who the character really is, and I personally never felt like something was of about LNS's character. They don't ever give you a reason to not believe the character is who they say they are.

Now don't get me wrong, I think LNS is a fantastic movie and I love it. I also haven't seen it in a while, so I could be super wrong in all of this and might be overlooking some things that I have forgotten about it. However, I don't remember getting a "this person isn't who they say they are" vibe from LNS. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I just watched The Guest and I really enjoyed the first half of it because it plays as a mystery. You're wondering who this guy *really* is, and you get a sense that the character is not who they say they are, and their background is kind of unclear whether it's true or not.

Another film I can thin of that kind of follows this is Stoker. In Stoker, you're not really sure who Matthew Goode's character *really* is, but there's something mysterious and off about him.

An interesting thing to note is that in both of these films, the mysterious character is a very charming and charismatic guy.

Are there any other movies that play around with the idea of someone not being who they say they are? Or where a character's true identity or back story is a mystery? 

I'd like to see more movies where there is a character who is mysterious, kind of off, and gives off an "I'm not who you think I am" kind of vibe.

Edit: I thought maybe it'd help if I clarify that I'm not looking for movies that just simply have a character that's not who you think they are, but movies that have a character that's not who you think they are and *the movie plays on this idea*. If that makes sense. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Storyboarding will save you time and are so efficient. The best part is that you don't have to be a good artist. Since you are directing and operating the camera, you are really the only person who needs to be able to discern them.

Storyboarding will make shooting so much easier and organized. It's so nice to go into a shoot knowing exactly what shots you need. Too many times I've gone into shoots without a storyboard planning to just improvise and I end up wasting a lot of time standing around trying to figure out shots. You save so much time when you storyboard because when you're done with one shot, you just refer to your board and can immediately know where and how to set up your camera. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I wouldn't say it's more /r/movies tier than most post on here. I posted this to get more of an understanding of what others thought of Goodfellas. 

It is entirely possible that Goodfellas was overhyped for me, and, in turn, I set myself up for disappointment. It's kind of hard for me to explain why it rubbed me the wrong way. I've never been great at articulating. I never said Goodfellas was bad. I do think it's a good movie. Above average and better than most movies. I just think that when compared to Scorsese's other work, Goodfellas hardly stands up. I know this isn't a great answer and not what you wanted to hear. 

Someone else said it earlier in this thread. They said that since I have seen Scorsese's recent work before I saw Goodfellas, it probably didn't seem like anything new or special. However, had I seen it when it came out, it would've been very fresh and interesting. I think this is entirely possible.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Triple Nine sounds great. Great cast and great director.

Everest is a great story with a great cast, but I'm worried about the director. Contraband and 2 Guns weren't great and this is the kind of story that needs a director that will do it justice. Although he did make an Oscar nominated film so there is still hope.

Is the Jungle Book going to be animated or live action? And will it be 3D or 2D animation? Do we know?

I had no idea the Coen brothers were writing a film for Steven Spielberg. That sounds pretty great.

The Martian is such a good book and I'm excited to see it, but I'm extremely worried since Ridley Scott is directing.

Never heard of The Revenant, but consider me excited. Interesting story and I love Alejandro Gonzlez Irritu.

Thanks for posting this, OP. I hadn't heard of some of these before so now I have new movies to look forward to! </TEXT>

My question is, how do I attach samples of work I've done to my resume?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's not quite a movie, though. It was from the 90s. It was a video where your face would be on the cartoon main character's body. You might have been riding a bull at some point? I don't know how it worked. I got it as a Christmas gift from my grandmother when I was like 6.

Any ideas? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree that Fincher's visual style would fit well. I don't know why what I said pissed a couple of people off, but I think Anderson is great at creating a tense atmosphere. Look at There Will Be Blood, it's not at all a scary movie, but it definitely felt unnerving and tense the whole time. Now imagine if he was actually trying to scare you. 

David Fincher is easily my favorite director working today, but I always thought his style was better suited for real world movies. Movies that are more grounded in reality. Which the same could be said for PTA, but I can see them both making a good Bioshock. </TEXT>

What camera/camera settings/lens combination, in your experience, replicates the range of light and colors humans see with their eyes the closest?

Using only natural lighting, have you found a lens/camera combo that replicates what we see with our naked eyes? </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I just saw John Wick and really liked it, but I was kind of distracted by the CGI blood. I'm a huge advocate for practical effects like actual squibs. However I totally understand the benefits of CGI blood like not having to clean up your set or actors or wardrobe when you reset a shot. So it logistically makes sense. And there are examples of good CGI of organic things like water. 

So why is CGI blood still kind of bad for the most part and are there any examples where the CGI blood and gore looked really good? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't think they're nitwits. Them not liking the movie isn't what bothers me. What bothers me is that they are so objective about it, yet only cite the story and structure without going into detail as the reason for it being bad. They refuse to have a discussion about it. I love discussing movies I love with people that don't like them! Of course all while being civil and respectful. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Is the Tree of Life technically a bad movie? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-11-06 01:45:29 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I really love the Tree of Life and my friends don't. I'm fine with this. People like different things. This doesn't bother me. What bothers me is that they say it's a "shit movie" and it's "terrible". They don't say they *think* it's bad they will say "No, dude, Tree of Life is bad."

This didn't use to bother me because my friends are the kind of movie goes who would rather watch an action movie. Not that there is anything wrong with that. So I just chalked it up to the fact that it's just a very different movie than what they are used to.

But then my film friend, a guy I've known since high school and talk movies with all the time, recently watched it. I thought, "Finally, someone who appreciates all kinds of movies will watch this with me." We watch it and I'm like, "Now I know someone else who will like it and I can talk to him about it." But alas, he also tells me it's pretty terrible.

So this got me thinking, am I missing something? Again, it's totally fine that my friends don't like Tree of Life. What bugs me is that they will objectively say it's a bad film. So artistic stuff aside, is The Tree of Life *technically* a bad movie?

Their reasoning is that the story is bad and say it's too hard to follow. 

So now I'm genuinely curious, is it bad technically? Am I biased because of how the movie affected me emotionally? So much so to where I cannot view it objectively?

Edit: I just want to clarify that I'm not here to pander. I seriously want to discuss the technical aspects of this film and the structure of the story. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I also find it frustrating when people just refuse to believe he has any talent. They just go, "Michael Bay? Total shit director." He's actually a damn fine director. The man can direct action like no other. Despite whatever opinions people have on the artistic value of Bad Boys II, I still think it's one of the best action movies from a directing standpoint. </TEXT>
