1) 9 people were shot, but this Dylann Roof didn't do it, that someone else did and he is being framed? 

2) Or that he did do it, but for some other reason than the one being stated? 

3) Or that those 9 people aren't really dead, but are being hidden away somewhere? 

4) Or that these 9 people and the shooter aren't real people, but were just invented and maintained sometime in the past to be used for this scenario?
