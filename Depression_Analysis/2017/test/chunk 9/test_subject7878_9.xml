Having homosexual urges == not a sin.

Acting on homosexual urges == a sin (i.e., adultery).

If Catholics accept homosexual marriage, it would no longer be considered adultery, and therefore would no longer be a sin.  This, in essence, would be changing church dogma.  How are any Catholics for same-sex marriage? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Former Papa John's driver here.

I knocked on an apartment door, and when it opened, the smell of weed wafted out.  Some skanky-looking blonde says, "Hey--come on in."  "Uhhhh....," I replied, "...okay...".

They had porn playing on the TV, and not only were the visuals distracting, but the incessant moaning of the woman on the screen.

They said to set the pizza down on the coffee table.  I went to do so, and realized that I had to miss the lines of cocaine they had ready to go.

She hands a wallet to a guy sitting there, and he hands me cash.  With a wink he said, "A little something extra for being such a nice guy."  I walked back to my car shaking my head, and expecting a nice tip.  After taking out the price of the pizza, it was a whopping $3.05 tip.

I should've called the cops on the cheap bastards.  HAHA! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In Louisiana, where I live, it appears to be the "black culture".  I can only attribute the harsher viewpoints on the fact that the black culture in this area is gangbanger. I'd assume a gay gangbanger would be labeled as a punk and not "hard".
