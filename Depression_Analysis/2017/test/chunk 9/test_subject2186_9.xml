	<TEXT> From my understanding, not really.  Every member state of the IWC is allowed to set its own whaling quota (and not just for "research" purposes).  Last year Japan overhauled its whaling program and presented the revised version to an IWC council.  The plan was rejected by the council, but it looks like Japan is going to go through with it anyway.  To me, the IWC seems to be more of a political club than any sort of governing body. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The sound from a fireworks display would probably not have an effect on their echolocation abilities.  Echolocation utilities high-frequency sound waves that are produced in the upper airways, directed through the melon, and received in the hollow lower jaw.  Since this system is primed for high-frequency sounds, the blast of a firework probably would not be picked up by it.

However, toothed cetaceans can also hear using ear bones just like us and there has been some research suggesting auditory hearing is more important in hunting than echolocating.  But as far as I know, there hasn't really been any research on the effects of prolonged exposure to loud noises in captive cetaceans.  Most of the sound waves would probably reflect off the surface of the water but there would still be some that enter the water so they can definitely hear it, but who knows how loud it would be.  So whether or not it hurts them is up for debate at this point.  Hearing is an important part of training for these guys also, so I would guess that these loud noises they experience don't have lasting negative effects.  I imagine it would be bad for business if the trainers couldn't communicate with the whales because they went deaf, so it would be in everyone's best interest if the sounds the animals are exposed to on a daily basis weren't too loud for them. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Wanted to say thanks for the wonderful music you guys have made over the years!  I have been following you since CTTM first came out and you got me through my teens and early 20s.  Each album is markedly different and you somehow found a way to make each sound great while avoiding being redundant.

My questions are:

Do you guys have different connections to the albums you've made based on the difference in sounds between them?

Is the new album stylistically similar to any of the others?

Thanks! </TEXT>
