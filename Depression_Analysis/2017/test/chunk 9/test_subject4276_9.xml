	<TEXT> While we're at it can we shame all these "no-bake"  recipes? No bake cheesecake is just not cheesecake, it's just awful tasting laziness. If you want something that's like cheesecake, just fucking make a cheesecake. It's not that difficult. 

*edit* and of course on the same day I complain about it here, someone on my Facebook shared a link to a mom blog

	<TEXT> I make a good crust but the thing about a good crust is the proofing time. Developing the gluten is what gives the pizza dough a great taste. So because of my laziness, I'd instead just pick up a couple of dough balls from a local pizza place. The dough balls were only $2.50 each. So I got the benefit of great pizza dough from a place where they had better control over proofing the dough rather than my haphazard methods </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What extensions did you use for YouTube? I've never really liked YouTubes layout but I've never seen anything that really fixes what I don't like. For example, I'm not a huge fan of the fact that collections were a pop-up/hover over menu. I'd constantly move the mouse too far and then have to hover over the collection again. And in general the YouTube page design is cluttered and convoluted, I prefer having these lists </TEXT>

	<TITLE> PSA: Decent alternative to YouTube collections, use Feedly </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-05-27 07:06:38 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> This took me a bit of time to do but there's a little trick that speeds the process up. First you want to go to feedly and create an account. Then go to the chrome Web Store and search for a feedly extension. This extension will add a button on the navigation/url bar that will appear whenever you're on a page you can subscribe to with Feedly. 

The best way to do this is to go to "manage subscriptions" and go through the list one by one. Click on the channel, then click the button on the nav bar, subscribe and add/create the appropriate folders, rinse and repeat. 

The only downside is that feedly will only keep 29 days worth of content unless you specifically save certain links I think. But I actually like this better because now it acts more like an email inbox which is what I always wished YouTube could be like. You can basically mark individual videos or channels as read and see only videos you haven't watched yet. No more coming back to a channel after a week to pick up on a series again only to find that your watched history has been cleared and you don't know what episode you were on. 

I hope this is helpful to anyone missing the collections. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In all my recent games so far I've survived almost exclusively on trapping rabbits and spiders and having a bird cage. I always camp near 4-6 rabbit holes. Even without filler that has been enough for my survival via meatballs. But if you're also close to a spider nest you can trap spiders too. I know you can easily fight them but kiting them far enough away at dusk so their friends don't join in takes longer than leading them into traps after stepping on the web.

If I have regular meat I'll use morsels, monster meat, and regular meat to make a meaty stew, otherwise, I cook the monster meat and feed it to my bird for eggs. Then I use my morsels and eggs to make bacon and eggs which gives 75 hunger and also gives you a good amount of sanity and health </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I haven't really played any. I played minecraft and was doing that when they started adding the BS survival stuff like hunger. It felt like it had no point to me because you could easily make a shit load of wheat farms with no effort and then you could just have a stack of bread that would last you a week. It just felt like a cheap half assed attempt at "difficulty" and all it did was waste an inventory spot when spelunking. I've been meaning to get into 7 days to die and project zomboid as I think those look great, but noting else was really appealing. I fell in love with don't starve the first time I saw someone play it on YouTube. The art direction is great as well </TEXT>

Got a bunch of meat right off the bat because I started near pigs and merms fighting. Found a pig village with king and spread out pig houses and spider dens. Then next to that was an awesome field of rabbit holes that has given me tons and tons of morsels, then a little further there was a massive beefalo herd. Just an awesome location and I got fucked because I got cocky with a tier 3 spider den </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I have a bunch of traps for rabbits in my world but some happen to be somewhat near a spider nest. I went to go collect one day and found monster meat in one and came to the conclusion that my traps were getting spiders. I set up a couple more closer to the next and sure enough, the next day they were filled with monster meat, spider glands, and silk. 

By this time, the nest was tier 3, I went to attack it because I needed more silk and ran through my traps, capturing all the spiders, and then went back and killed the nest without issue and replanted the egg. 

Does anyone else do this for spider nests? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I actually like willow. I know torches are cheap but I like not having to make them. I also make frequent use of charcoal over wood for fires so I always have little patches of trees growing. Sanity is never an issue when you can go light a patch of trees on fire and stand in the middle of it. What I do hate though is that she can be immune to fire but not overheat, which doesn't make sense because I think the two should go hand in hand. I also hate the glitch of setting crock pots on fire if you're holding your lighter, which I think was fixed in the base game, but I use a modded willow with her regular abilities for DST playing with my wife </TEXT>
