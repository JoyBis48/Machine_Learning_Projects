	<TEXT> I disagree. Behind that "marketing" racing team, most likely lies a real racing team that works hard to win and have a passion for racing. For example Red Bull Racing is nothing more than Horner's own Arden Racing Team. Similar to Marussia, who is just the sponsor, the real team that runs the racing outfit is Manor. Sponsors comes and goes, but these people and team will remain, albeit in another name when the time comes. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, that leads us back to the first problem, all the racing games that utilised the SRW-S1 LED, or can utilise it are Windows based

Hence it's easier for me to just use Windows </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I did say custom or special. The steering wheel will not work, especially for the thrustmaster steering base that the steering wheel can be swapped around as different steering have different buttons and functions 

Fanatec's support say they have no reason to support Linux since most racing games are on Windows

and SteelSeries SRW-S1 works without any driver on Windows 8.1 but certainly not debian </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't care about the lack of directX on linux. What bothers me (and stoppign me from using it) is the lack of drivers for custom or special controllers/peripherals

I have a steering wheel (thrustmaster), a seperate pedal system (Fanatec), and a modded shift light indicator (SteelSeries) and all of them would only work on Windows </TEXT>

They should find something that negates the dirty air effect. Ground effect has been thrown around, but teams are not keen to go back on them. 

One solution is to ditch wings altogether. Surely would make Raikkonen and Lauda happier </TEXT>

	<TEXT> All wrestlers have that "opening identity" that makes it easy for people to recognise who the wrestler is from just a few bars.

Most of Jim Johnston's music has this style. They range from a signature sound; Austin's glass shatter, Mick Foley's car crash, Undertaker's gong; or a signature line that is sung; The Rock, BA Billy Gunn, The Big Show; those songs were easy to identify and would always instantly make you recognise who is coming out </TEXT>

Also VR won't give them any advantage. It's slightly more laggier, as well as drivers don't even have much range of head movement in the cockpit in real life means there is no reason for them to use it </TEXT>
