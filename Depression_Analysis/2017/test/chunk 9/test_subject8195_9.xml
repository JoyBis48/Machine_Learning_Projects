	<TITLE> Alrighty I got a quick question about Steins;Gate Zero and other things [SPOILERS] </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-07-10 10:31:37 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I just finished my ninth rewatch of Steins;Gate.  
Or, I should say I watched it to episode 22, before he saves Kurisu and it sort of "ends" so to speak.

So this is where the question comes in.  
I started reading/read all of the available Steins;Gate Epigraph stuff of whatever when he's got major PTSD and stops pretending to be Hououin Kyouma.

From my understanding, does the events of the Epigraph stuff/Steins;Gate Zero happen when he declines Amane's offer to save Kurisu in episode 23 of the first season?

Then I'm assuming does this follow a world line where he decides to kick his ass back into being Hououin Kyouma?  
Or does it revolve around his darker side and his traumatic experiences from the first season?  
I hope the latter is the case because delving deeper into his psyche and how he was affected (like in the Epigraph stuff) sounds really really interesting.

Any insight would be awesome. Thanks.

	<TEXT> Alright, so I've been getting ready to build a shiny new G3. I have a list of questions and other things to help me clear stuff up. The base build will be a JG G3 and I already have a cart of metal body parts ready.  
Now, the internals are a different story.

On BingoAirsoftWorks, he mentioned that the G3 used a standard M4 nozzle, and I noticed how the G3 uses a V2 gearbox. The only exception of course is the selector plate, I think.  
Is this true/will this work if I can just drop in a new V2 gearbox and a new selector plate ([like this](http://www.evike.com/products/25893/))?

Next, would be the hop up unit. I haven't the slightest clue what it uses. I have a JG G3 already, but I can't tell what it is. Google isn't too helpful when it comes to G3's.

I think that's the brunt of my questions, and any help would be awesome.

Quickish edit: I think I have everything I need with the exception of a motor.  
Here's a quick list,  
[Nozzle] (http://www.evike.com/products/25970)  
[Selector plate] (http://www.evike.com/products/25893)  
[Gearbox] (http://www.evike.com/products/24818)  
[Trigger] (http://www.evike.com/products/35885)

Only thing left I need is a motor, which I am clueless on </TEXT>

My picture quality was kind of shit because I used the picture setting on my video camera. I also have an MP5k, but he's in the SMG corner.

Actually if you want a little update, I returned the Oscar and the Pictus and got an oranda red cap gold fish for now.

As for my future plans I'm building an aquarium for a clown knife fish, and then the ten gallon I have now will become a feeder fish tank. </TEXT>
