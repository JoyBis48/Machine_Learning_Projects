	<TEXT> Well it was 2008 or 2009. I was at my parents house alone. I was looking for something in the guest bedroom when I felt like i was being watch. I glance over my shoulder to see it standing by the door. I did a double take and turned all the way around only to see it glide out through the doorway. I was shocked so I slowly walked to the door but it was gone. I dont remember going into the bathroom or filling up the tub. But I do remember being underwater long enough that I started seeing a white light that seemed to be getting brighter. Then the light started faded away in the distance and I regain my senses and sit up to find out Im in the tub of water. Desperately trying to catch my breathe again, I was so confused. Right next to the tub was a statue of Jesus I guess I brought into the bathroom and I kind of broke down and started crying. I haven't seen the shadow since then. </TEXT>
