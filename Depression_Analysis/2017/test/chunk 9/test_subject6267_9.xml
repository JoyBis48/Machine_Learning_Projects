	<TEXT> I sometimes make slices with sweet potatoes as snacks. Cause I'm lazy and its to hot to use an oven, I just slice them and pop them into the microwave for about 8 mins and they're soft. For cruchiness, another 3 mins and flipping them over makes them a great snack. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Doesn't bother me either, I don't know why but I can completely block out what I know and still focus on the story. I do it with books too, Harry Potter is a great example of how I read it backwards. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think a lot of Disney is... I watched Aladdin the other day and realised that Jasmine was dressed as a harem girl even though she was a princess.

Theres a buzzfeed article on it [here](http://www.buzzfeed.com/jessicamisener/are-these-disney-movies-racist#.us9ld7RXR9) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree with what you're saying on The Secret Life of Walter Mitty too. For me, Drive: story line was poor but man, if you can watch it and completely tune out what they're saying and just listen to the music...

Sometime Wes Anderson's stuff, The Grand Budapest Hotel in particular. I found the story to be the blandest out of his work but the sheer attention to detail is overwhelming. I recently read an article about the set design and how the word 'patisserie' on Mendl's boxes was spelt wrong and Anderson picked up on it and had it corrected in post-production. 

Edit: perhaps not *disproportionately* good but John Wick had beautiful visuals and soundtrack too, especially considering the storyline </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think this explains it pretty well, the neutral tones are often in characters with a   e.g. ,, and these are pronounced very short.

Try doing exercises with just the 'a' vowel like       .

I do find that most people struggle with the third tone, but its just a falling and rising tone and longer than the others. Try it out with different consonants and vowels to get a feel but  is probably one of the more difficult ones to do. </TEXT>
