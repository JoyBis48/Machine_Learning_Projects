And this chick from Boston was wicked hot in bed last night, and I'm getting more muscular, even though I've stopped working out, and I've got this amazing poker group."

	<TEXT> I love Marshal but I've always agreed with what you just said. A lot of the decisions that he makes do not make sense at all, especially him clearly being a smart person. Buying a house within a day of seeing it?  I never thought about the car money thing but that's also a good point </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This episode makes me think it would have been awesome if there would have been 1 episode for the other characters to tell the story instead of Ted, give us a little more insight to their personal thoughts. Especially Barney and Lily, they would be interesting.

So was this a platonic act done by Ted at the end? </TEXT>
