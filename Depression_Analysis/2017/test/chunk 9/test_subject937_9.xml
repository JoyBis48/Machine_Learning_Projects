	<TEXT> I think the broad principle works with the analogy. In our bodies, a certain stability and predictability is required to live (e.g., blood pumped must arrive where it needs to be).

On Earth, the same stability and predictability is required for life (e.g., winter must yield to spring).

The body and the Earth are both systems that require certain conditions to support life. If those conditions are removed, the systems will fail. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Because it's not possible. All it takes is a contradiction and there will be no resolution because neither will yield.

Racists made the argument in the 60's that integration violated their religious beliefs. But if segregation is a violation of the Equal Protection Clause and if both constitutional rights (i.e., the 1st Amendment rights of the racist and the 14th Amendment rights of the black students) allow for no restrictions, what is the result?

How can this be resolved without restricting one? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You seem to be looking at this from an immature perspective. It's not about offending anyone or "staying classy".

First, if you ask someone you're casually dating if they're "fucking someone else", don't be surprised if you aren't soon dating them anymore.

Second, if you do ask in an appropriate manner, don't be surprised if the answer is something along the lines of "that's not your business".

Adults can have sex with whomever they want. If you're dating one (without exclusivity), it's really not your business. If you want to ask, go ahead - but accept the response and consequences of doing so.

Ultimately, if you want the right to be upset that someone else is "inside of" them too, then ask to be exclusive. This is not hard stuff. </TEXT>

Do you have a source for your information? I'm still looking but your comments make it sound like he was left out for obviously partisan purposes.

Edit: The resignation was a separate incident from the nomination withdrawal. There's not much I can find on the nomination withdrawal but it seems like he was fairly controversial.

Edit 2: The New York Times had a pretty damning [editorial](http://www.nytimes.com/1984/03/29/opinion/mr-meese-should-withdraw.html) about why he should have withdrawn, and did Reagan's own then-Attorney General appoint the special prosecutor to investigate? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yep - there is nothing positive about what happened, or that the events are being reported.

What bothers me the most about the reporting and gossip is how her *rape* is being ignored or diminished. Having sex with an unconscious person is undeniably rape.

Shame all around. </TEXT>

Without getting into a semantic fight over "know", I don't see why not. I'm sure past experience with racism creates patterns.

No, he's not. The rules of evidence weed out a lot of what can make something obvious but not legally provable. And that's when the non-excluded evidence is greater than 51%. Something that is 49% likely to have happened is still very likely to have happened. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh come on. Of course everyone's opinion of a city is going to be slightly different.

But you ranted and raved against the city as if your experience is a good indicator of daily life here.

I'll leave it be cause you obviously have a major chip on your shoulder. I'll just stand by my original response: don't listen to him, OP.

OP, if you want objective stats about crime, natural beauty, activities, quality of life, standard of living, job opportunities, future growth,  cost of living, etc., just use Google. Augusta is always ranked very highly.

Oh, and Savannah is much hotter than Augusta. But I do love Savannah. Great city. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> See, claiming there is no beauty here is proof that you are not evaluating the city objectively. Sure, you may have had a bad experience, but don't extrapolate and assume yours was universal.

I'd wager you haven't been here in quite a while. With the Cyber Command and the second highest growth rate in tech jobs in the country (yes, the country), you probably dislike something that you wouldn't even recognize.

But, hey, keep on hatin'. Good for the soul, right? </TEXT>
