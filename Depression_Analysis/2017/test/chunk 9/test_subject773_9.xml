	<TEXT> Glowie is a 30 year old Morgan mare.  She sound of body except for some arthritis you would expect at her age, but is rather senile.  She has a stall but prefers not being in it, so the door is simply left open and she comes and goes as she pleases.  She wanders around the barn, the indoor arena, and around the farm grounds.  She is slow moving and never strays too far.  She is usually found napping, watching lessons, or raiding people's bags and purses for goodies. :)  It can be a shock to new visitors to just see her strolling around on a sunny day! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Cushings is a tough thing.  It's great that Lenny has made it so long though!  I think Cushings is the one drawback about Morgans -- some of them just seem to be prone to it.  When we put Baby down she still looked pretty good, but was having problems moving around and walking comfortably.  Winter was on its way, so we made the decision to put her down before she got really bad.  Definitely do pictures with Lenny this summer, you'll treasure them forever!  We also had a bronze commissioned of Baby, and that is a very special thing to me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks RonRonner!  We kept her happy and comfortable as long as we could.  She'd had IR problems since she was about 10, and I had to stop riding her about a year before we put her down at the age of only 16.  She had some problems keeping weight on, but never got too bad.  The farm and their staff is incredible, and I credit their expertise and diligent care when it comes to how long she stayed sound and happy.  She is buried on the farm, under the pasture where the new foals play. :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My horse hasn't had a lame day in his life, and my young colt has also had no issues at all thus far.  My mare, who we lost last year, did succumb to chronic laminitis.  This is probably the one "problem" Morgans have.  They are prone to laminitis, insulin resistance, and founder.  However, most Morgans I know were hale and hardy until their mid to late 20s.  They are indeed tough, while having beautiful refinement.  

As for ants in their pants -- I can really come down to breeding and training.  My horse can be rather fire-breathing, in the respect that he always wants to go as fast as possible!  I never really ask him to go forward, just to slow down.  When we do our extensions, I simply stop trying to slow his body and off we go!  So many Morgans I've ridden are like this -- go go GO!  But they do have great brains as well.  My gelding is often TOO smart for his own good.  He even has a full understanding of the music they play at our shows, and will try to transition into the next gait when he hears the key of the music change!

Well, when you rebuild your wallet, and if you want to look into a Morgan, you know where to find me on Reddit!  Depending on what part of the country you're in, there could be some really great opportunities.  Have you ever considered taking lessons at a Morgan barn just to try out their dressage abilities? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Morgans are great little dressage horses!  I have several friends who use their horses for dressage, and now Western dressage is becoming really popular as well.  If you want any Morgan dressage connections, PM me and I can get you in touch with the right folks.

Even though my horse competes in hunter pleasure, we do a lot of basic dressage exercises with him at home, especially now that we're trying to get him better with patterns.  He overthinks everything and jumps to conclusions!  The dressage work is slowing his brain down a bit. :)  Here's a pic of him doing his thing in the show ring because, well, who doesn't love more horse pictures? :)

	<TEXT> Well, I'm not sure if this will clarify much (as reins just tend to look like a tangle), but here is my horse wearing the aforementioned rein configuration.  The bit he's wearing in this picture isn't the same one we're discussing here, but the reins are run in the same way.  Snaffle rein goes directly from hand to bit, and is clipped to the ring of the bit.  Curb rein goes from saddle, through bit ring, and doubles back.

Hope that clears things up a little!

EDIT: the curb rein also goes through the martingale.  Forgot to say that! </TEXT>
