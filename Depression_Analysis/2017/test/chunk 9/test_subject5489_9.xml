	<TEXT> I was chased by a mother rhino in a park outside Kruger while having tea at sunset. We all jumped in the truck and drove off as fast as possible. She didn't chase the truck far, and went back to her overly curious baby.

Another trip, this with my family, we were kayaking in a river on the Pacific side of Costa Rica. My grandmother got sun block in her eyes, and had to be driven miles back to a local doctor half way through. Almost at the end of the ride, in crocodile infested waters, my kayak capsized. I jumped back in quick, but the thought still bothers me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi random people!

Well. Um. Yea definitely gay! Tried the ole' gay to straight conversion therapy out when I was younger, not my cup of tea.

But I appreciate that immensely! Your grandfather was a wise man.

Something my great grandmother once told me before she passed away...

 I lived on a farm in Ohio. We had goats and pigs, chickens and cows, dogs and cats; you should of seen the place, it was beautiful. If I have one regret in this life time, it is not writing about this farm. I always wanted to write a book, at least a diary from that time. I painted it, sure, but I never wrote about it's magic.

I've been writing since then. Sounds like you've lived a life and a half. Could be an interesting read, even if just for yourself years later. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I really like how you finished that and 100% agree. Inexperienced dog owners should not get these breeds, spitz-like or wolf like, in almost any climate, especially warmer.

Stick with Golden Retrievers and German Shepherds, JUST DON'T SHAVE THEM!!! </TEXT>

Huskies, which are my favorite breed (my dad used to breed them, and they currently have one), are bad. I've had every bodily fluid on me from a husky. They are wild, dramatic, territorial, touchy, judgmental, and of all the dogs to groom, they are my favorite. It's like an adrenaline rush, will I die? Will I get mauled? Will I get bit? Or will I get cuddles? Who knows hahaha 

Edit: one of my favorite haircuts to do are schnauzers and wheaton terriers. Both difficult dogs to deal with at times. </TEXT>

Another source: I groom dogs for a living! The hair usually grows back, but after a few repeated 'summer time' clips, will never look the same. These breeds were meant to have long coats. Blowing out the undercoat with a force dryer (which your groomer can do) or just providing some routine good ole' brushing should do the trick! Plus, it'll get rid of all that shedding. (Shaving a dog won't, it will just make the shedding hairs smaller)

EDIT: I've also have owned siberian huskies my entire life. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I do groom dogs, yes.

What i tell my clients? Brush the dog once to twice a week, for your dog I might suggest a slicker brush, Amazon has a wonderful one called Miracle Brush, I love it. For dogs that shed, horse racks are good or furminators, though I'm careful with those as they cause brush burn.

Bathing once a month or every 6 weeks helps with smell, making sure the dog is 100% dry after each time they get wet will ensure a good smelling dog. Mold occurs when an undried dog is allowed to naturally air dry.

Brushing would also deal with avoiding mats and plant material in the fur. Also, if you walk in to a grooming salon, they will quickly spot shave mats out for a low, low fee, and it's usually a walk in service, no appointment needed.

Double coated dogs have two coats, a fluffy under coat, and a coarse top coat. The common misconception is that shaving a dog cools them in the summer. This is false. The natural hair actually protects from the sun, and when thoroughly brushed out, allows air to naturally channel through the hair follicles. A common example I give is a german shepherd. When you shave a german shepherd, the fluffy undercoat is typically trapped, creating a webbing affect. As the top coat attempts to grow out, the bottom coat prevents it in certain areas, giving that choppy appearance your pup has. This can also lead to acne, over heating, sun burn, and increased condensed undercoat for micro-organisms to thrive in.

If you have any more questions, feel free to ask. I love helping fellow dog owners out. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Brush out corded dogs? What? 

Like you sort of said, these are carefully formed flocks, split repetitively to perfect dimensions, allowed to grow out.

If you want to.... not have those... you shave the dog. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE do not try to remove matting this heavy with a brush or demating tools. That's cruel and causes a lot of pain to the dog.

Your dog has severe matting? Bring them to the groomer or the vet to be shaved down. Then, brush your dog 1-2 times a week. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yea I googled corded havanese, I just can't pull up the pictures on my phone. Tons.

These dogs with 'Hair' not coat, create oils that can be just great for cording. Though, they can also be nightmare for just normal grooming. I see matted havaneses, poodles, malteses, Shih tzus, way way way way too often. They look like someone chopped off 70% of Bob Marley's dreads an left him outside on a hobo budget. That dog is getting stripped down by either me or a vet. I'm in the dematting is animal cruelty camp. But I digress. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So as a groomer, I can comment on this...

Bathe them a few times a year. Like 4-6. Each bathing session takes a total of about 12-14 hours (drying included in that). Each flock must be soaped and dried individually for best result. 

If one of the flocks starts to smell of mildew (like an old tent) my suggestion would be to take off that specific flock, though I know groomers that might use tar and sulfur shampoo, a vinegar 10:1 solution, or some Nature's Miracle solution.

Edit: Since a lot of people are asking about the drying process, I found a vet's blog about his Pulis, another corded breed. Here's some of his tips.


The length of time he needs to stay in the dryer will depend on the form of the cords - how densely each cord is packed. Never use heat for drying a Puli. Being strong willed, a Puli is capable of objecting so strenuously to being mistaken for a lobster that he fusses himself into heat stroke, not from the heat of the dryer as much as the heat of his frustration. The safest and most comfortable dryer is as follows:

Build a platform tall enough to set a large (18") high velocity fan underneath.
Obtain 2 fans with a lifetime guarantee - like a Patton fan - and set one underneath pointing straight up. (See why you want that guarantee?)
Place your dogs cage, which should be of the small mesh construction, upside down (if necessary) over a hole cut in the top of the platform, just a bit smaller than the dimensions of the cage. Upside down the pan can be left out without the Puli falling through the cracks!
Place the Puli in the cage and position the second fan in front and at the same level as the cage. Turn on both fans, and retreat from earshot for the appropriate number of hours.
Dont worry about the Puli in this arrangement if the crate is secure on top of the stand and the stand is securely built. I usually do this before bedtime, and leave him in overnight. This is a sufficient length of time to dry most dogs, at least if the wringing and sweatshirting have proceeded as above, and hes usually the most comfortable one in the house; a breeze in his face, white noise, the cage hes used to sleeping in anyway (well, in some cases). If its cool where he is add a commercial dryer on top to slightly warm the air - thats all it will do with an open wire crate and two fans. You really wont endanger your dog with this setup.

You definitely do have to rig up something like this if you are going to keep your Puli in a full corded coat. You may be able to tolerate the smell of your darling if he isnt completely dry, but believe me, no one else will and you will be guilty of smearing the reputation of the whole breed! Could you live with that knowledge? If you dont dry him thoroughly, in 2 or 3 days, bacteria will bloom inside the warm, damp centers of the cords, and your Puli will reek. Itll be much worse than he smelled before the effort and agony of the bath. After youve removed your guy from the drying cage, check him again in a few hours to see if capillary action has pulled moisture out to the dry outer layers from still wet inner layers. If so, in again for another 3 hours or so. He hates it when he reeks and people avoid him, and you will pay for it! </TEXT>

Clinical factors associated with rape victims' ability to testify in court: a records-based study of final psychiatric recommendation to court.

http://www.huppi.com/kangaroo/L-CJSpoor.htm

 The O.J. Simpson murder trial provided us with a snapshot of a system that is heavily biased towards money -- even more so than race. Without his Dream Team of lawyers, O.J. would have been convicted of murder within a matter of weeks. Indeed, trial lawyers everywhere conceded that death sentences have been handed out on lesser evidence. The counterpoint to this observation is the true-life movie Dead Man Walking. In the movie, white death-row inmate Matthew Poncelet tells Sister Helen Prejean: "There ain't no money on death row." 

 The rich have several important, if not decisive, advantages when it comes to handling the legal justice system. They can afford bail, which allows them to conduct their own investigations and prepare for trial. They can afford better attorneys (by itself an enormous edge), better expert witnesses, better private detectives, better alibis. In fact, rich corporations or individuals often threaten to put up such a huge legal battle that courts often seek to plea bargain away or even dismiss the charges. 

 There are two ways that sentencing is biased against the poor. First, the rich either write or lobby for the very laws that purport to oversee their behavior. Harsh sentences for the poor are softened whenever legislators write them for the rich, even though their crimes may be many times greater. Second, judges have shown themselves reluctant to make common criminals out of the community's best and finest. Both of these biases have created wide disparities in sentencing. For example, millionaire Jack Clark received no fine and only one year in jail for cheating stockholders out of $200 million. Yet in the same courthouse, a minimum wage worker who had stolen $5,000 received four years in prison -- that is, 160,000 times the punishment. (13) 

 A study of federal and state courts found that the poor were not only found guilty more often, but that they were not recommended for probation 27 percent of the time, compared to 16 percent for the upper classes. The poor were also not given suspended sentences 23 percent of the time, compared to 15 percent for the upper classes. 



"Circle-jerk" or not, you live in a fairy tale land. Economic disparity in jail sentencing is a thing.

	<TEXT> Hi, thanks for doing this AMA.

I have heard a lot of about the russian bloggers, bots, propagandists, scoring the web for topics on the Ukraine/Russia issue going on (my intense condolences by the way, my prayers have been going out for those suffering these atrocities). 

I was wondering if you believe any of this misinformation is going the other way as well? Ukrainian nationalist in comment sections on news articles marking up facts, etc.

Another question, I've heard of people staying in the worst hit of cities, even after bombings and rocket fire, looting and crime, still staying in their home towns, sometimes even unable to physically leave due to old age, or simply attachment to the towns themselves. When I heard this, I thought the Ukranian government would be making mandatory evacuations, and providing shelter to those displaced (e.g. refugee camps). Are people being helped leaving their towns? Should they leave, and if they aren't, why, other than reasons being speculated? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ok, weird, but I LOVE WORKING WITH HUSKIES. There. I said it. I just love their weird idiosyncrasies and wildness.

I also love love love doing schnauzer clips. Their so fun and shapely.

Least favorite? Maybe a shiba. But I say that cautiously, as I seriously love most dogs.  </TEXT>

(7th and last poodle haircut pictures)

A lamb cut... is just even. The lines flow, it can be short, long, whatever. It's just a standard pet hair cut.

Town and Country is dramatically short on the neck, chest, body. I've seen a #10 blade. Legs trimmed and columnar. Pom matching the top knot. Obviously the face and feet clean shaven.

If I'm wrong, please correct me. Not being /s, I like totally get your confusion. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No, you think all those things. I didn't say them. I just don't get up in arms when someone claims I am acting this way, or like such thing, stereotypical. I embrace it, and I continue to live my life within the context that I am not special, and I am not unique. I am simply a product of the culture I surround myself with.

You have low self esteem, and I'm sorry. Have a good night. </TEXT>
