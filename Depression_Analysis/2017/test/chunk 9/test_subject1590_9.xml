	<TEXT> My personal preference is the east asian library (on the 8th floor of Robarts). I liked books there and also few people use that library. For most people (that are non-east asian, so to say), they find the trinity library has pretty good scenery, so that's a place to check out. </TEXT>

Use the library system wisely - UofT has a lot of books, and I had a lot of fun, when I was there as  grad student, reading stuff not from my subject. It's great learning and free too! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't know, maybe the stakes matter more than whether you are online or offline. People tend to focus less for online games because those are just entertainment really, but when you play in person you are most likely competing for something and so people play more seriously (and hence harder). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> But Olympics are slightly different right? FIFA WC is played in a number of cities, and for a country like Germany, they have many high end stadiums for their league games already, so that's not a problem at all. But for Olympics, it's all in one city and there are a lot of different sports (so a lot more stadiums are needed in a more concentrated area). Does that make a difference? </TEXT>

Raul is kind of like del Piero in some sense, both achieved great things for their respective clubs, but not as much at the national level. </TEXT>
