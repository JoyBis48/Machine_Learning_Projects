	<TEXT> Of course what I **feel** doesn't change the actual law, I'm not trying to say that.

I'm simply pointing out how unenforceable the law is for anybody that's not trucking thousands of stolen milk crates off to a recycling facility.

I could have [one of these](http://www.amazon.com/Buddeez-MC01016BLK-Crates-16-Quart-2-Pack/dp/B00I9VP9NU/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8 qid=1423098979 sr=8-1 keywords=milk+crate) strapped to my bike, or I could have [one of these](http://images.onset.freedom.com/ocregister/gallery/mgnjv8-b781049432z.120130114213840000g4k1bvr1d.2.jpg) with, say, the warning worn completely off.

Further, there simply aren't enough resources to prosecute every offender with a stray milk crate laying about. 

Facts are facts, I'm not arguing that. 

I have however, spent the last hour researching the question, reading police forums and news articles and subreddits etc... I can't find one case where an officer has been willing to cite a person carrying a milk crate around, even with the warning label on it, without having first seen the person physically pick the crate off of some property. 

I did see one kid who claimed to have found two milk crates on the side of a dumpster, pick them up and started walking home. The police stopped him, asked him where he got them, he explained and they took them, or something.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  But we take out them, for example, we spent over $4.33 million last year on milk crates. And we can no longer just ignore that and absorb the cost. We have to go out and attempt to reclaim our crates.

And how the fuck does he intend to reasonably do that? By throwing college kids in jail? I have a milk crate that I inherited from a roommate years ago. It's so old and sun bleached that no lettering can be made out. I still use it to this day. 

If I got pulled over on a routine traffic stop while moving and had that in my car, it seems ludicrous to me that that is a potential felony.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> pickling is pretty damn easy, start small and if you end up going nuts over pickles you can work your way up.

Off the top of my head: a stock pot, couple of measuring utensils, food grade mason jars, a knife etc... Pickling spices and food to pickle. 

Basic pickling procedure is to a) make a brine and b) ferment your vegetables in the brine.

Cleanliness is a must as fermentation can be conducive to mold etc if you don't clean everything with soap and hot hot hot water.

With this basic knowledge, I would suggest buying a pickling cookbook. I don't have a suggestion for you, and I would imagine that any one would do for you to start out with.

My personal favorite is pickled beets. I fucking love them. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't have a tablet, and I have an affinity for reading from paper.

I just printed out two articles to read because I'm super tired and sick of staring at my computer screen and just want to lay on my couch and read for a minute.

However, the print outs look awful. Search bars, comment boxes and submit buttons are all present. Navigation, archives and article contents are all stacked and have standard looking blue underlined hyperlink styles. All of this combined takes up two - three pages.

I know it's super simple to do, but I just realized that of all the websties I've made / contributed to in the past year, I don't think one of them describes even basic print styles. 

Any opinions? Am I the only person under 40 who prints stuff from the internet? </TEXT>

Windows is still huge, many serious devs and companies have workstations running it.

Look, a product launch can support whatever the fuck it wants to. But to say that asking for windows support is a bit much, *I think* is invalid. Windows still has huge market share, period. By excluding it, you exclude part of the community that actively develops with it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Your Honor, this case is clear cut. 

The charges are as follows: 

1 charge of GRANDTHEFT.JPG
1 charge of Karma Whoring

The prosecutions defense is thus:

he definitely stole the picture above and tried to claim it as his own. The title is a dead giveaway. And I quote "Some soulless mother fucker put this sticker on the wall next to me at TPA Airport".

Yet, I see no admission of guilt and no direct claim of ownership.

After all, the burden of proof falls on the prosecutor to show **beyond all reasonable doubt** that the defendant has committed a crime. 

And in no good conscience can we say that this defendent, beyond reasonable doubt, has made a claim that this picture is his own. 

By the prosecutions line of reasoning, defendant /u/metalligod666 could have been in the very airport where this picture was taken. Knowing of the existence of the picture as has been posted on popular forums and subreddits, found it and reposted to reddit.

My client is guilty of the misdemeanor of reposting a picture to reddit. And if we were to attend to each and every one of these offenses, the courts would be bogged down for years.

I move that the charges of grandtheft.jpg be dropped as there is no definitive proof that my client has claimed the picture as his own.

We'll be willing to settle for one (1) charge of karma whoring, which entails a stern warming and nothing further. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree. I fucking love the game, but there has to be something else to do. Maybe I'm just overplaying it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I haven't bitched once about this game. But sometimes the RNG is a bit ridiculous. I don't mind repeating the same strike three times in a row, or afking people or anything. But I did 6 strikes today and got jack shit for anything useful. 

*edit* other than leveling the cryptarch and vanguard rep / marks. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've had destiny for two weeks now. Playing up to 20 was awesome. And then grabbing gear to get to 22 was fun. Now I'm level 24, and I'm a bit confused as to what else to do. I've basically been running tiger strikes for the past two days, and doing some bounties. But once bounties are up it's either strikes or patrol, which get prettyy boring.

So is that it? Grind and grind to get the gear to do nightfall and vog?

Any suggestions? I kind of suck at pvp.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would like to ask, does this matter anymore since the user has deleted the account? And if it does, are there screenshots of the threads presented as evidence before the account was deleted?

I'll be prosecutor either way. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  I'm hoping that some day I can find some chanterelles and get them ID'd without this subreddit getting all fingerwaggling and jerky about it.

Just keep at it. I would suggest finding a local meetup / club where you'd be able to learn more about IDing and hunting.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not sure if it's an influx of new people to this sub or what. I've noticed a couple of these mildly dismissive, sometimes snarky responses popping up in the past few weeks.

Granted, I'm not a huge fan of "WHAT IS THIS? CAN I EAT THIS?" posts. But I'm also not a fan of "Don't ask if you don't know!" types of responses.

This is legit one of the few subreddits that keeps me coming back to reddit. I really like the community here. 

I feel like answering someone's ID request in such a way is unfriendly, and a cop out. Even if you can't make out / do not have the skill to make a complete identification, the least you can do is say something along the lines of:

*looks like what you've got there is a [boletus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boletus). Take more / better pictures and do a spore print for better help on identification. Also remember that it's highly suggested that you be 100% sure of you edible identification before you eat it.* </TEXT>
