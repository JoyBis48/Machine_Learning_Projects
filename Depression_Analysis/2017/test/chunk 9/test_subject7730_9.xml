	<TITLE> Went Ice-Skating for an 8th Grade Trip... </TITLE>

	<TEXT> We went to San Francisco for an 8th grade trip and one of the things we did were go ice skating outside in the middle of the city. Keep in mind, I can't skate period, and I remember holding on the the side railing the entire time on the ice as I slowly walked around the rink one time before deciding to get off the ice, regretting the wasted 20 dollars renting the skates. Just as I was about 5 feet away from the exit, I look to my right to see a girl who had seemingly got the hang of skating until, and I shit you not, her skates completely malfunctioned under her feet and let me tell you...there was no time inbetween this chick skating perfectly and her face planting while sliding in the wall head first. Never wanted to laugh so hard in my entire life...I'm going to hell. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not sure if both pronounciations are correct but one of them just sounds incorrect and it irritates me. Its honestly a pet-peeve of mine. In my mind:

* Correct: Sen-air-ee-o

* Incorrect: Sen-ar-ee-o

Edit: The latter is used in Britain most likely, but is cringeworthy when an American with no distinguishable accent pronounces it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> ??? Believe it or not, I haven't seen Park n Rec. Saw first episode and thought it was a rip-off of 'The Office' which I loved. Everyone was annoying and I only laughed once in the episode in the very end when the dude with the mustache said something about a gun or maybe something about the flag idk I forgot. Seriously though, I'm talking from experience about my fecal situation. You've never had a dry shit? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Most people who claim to have insomnia don't. Usually they're doing something that stimulates their brain which can be anything from the emission of blue light from your Iphone or laptop (which actually stimulates you the most of different light types which I won't get too deep into) or even having a simple source of light like a lamp or nitelight which could confuse your brain into thinking it's still day-time and prevents from certain chemicals in your brain which help get you drowsy. I have sleep problems too. Sleep at 4am, wake at 2pm depressed that I only have a couple more hours of day light to be productive. Vicious cycle. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Seems to be a problem though. From what you have said, it sounds like you brush at night, mouthwash in the morning, and brush again after lunch. So, you're brushing two times a day which can be bad like you said. I would skip brushing after lunch and just brush at night but then I feel like my breath would stink even with mouthwash throughout the day.  </TEXT>
