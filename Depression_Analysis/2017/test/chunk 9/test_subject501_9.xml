	<TEXT> Guy Ritchie's best IMO, followed closely by Lock Stock. The writing is brilliant and often hilarious, I love the fast and edgy tone and editing of the film. One of Brad Pitt's best performances, Statham, Vinnie Jones, Del Toro, and all the others are all fantastic. Would love to hear what you guys think of it.

He's proved himself an actor to keep an eye out for since Brokeback Mountain. But recently with Source Code, End of Watch, Prisoners, Enemy, Nightcrawler and probably his upcoming movie 'Southpaw' he's proved himself to be a must see actor in ANY film he's in. He's got 3 coming out this year, Southpaw, Everest and Demolition. I'll happily be seeing all 3 of them.  </TEXT>
