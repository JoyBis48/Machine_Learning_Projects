	<TEXT> Yeah but turfing it on to neighboring suburbs isn't the answer with a kick/lock out isn't the best option. I only hope the bar owners take some responsibility here, however if their track record is anything to go by, it'll be the usual "we're not doing anything wrong, stop punishing us" mantra, where the blame is entirely deflected to a preloading culture rather than addressing the root cause. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I get what you're saying, and perhaps I'm being too harsh, let me explain further.

I know I probably would have failed School cert, I certainly failed NCEA.

I know I'm not a fucking idiot as I'm not doing too badly in the game of life, but to fail and have beside the failure "Did not achieve" was insulting to say the least. 

I mean look at HTC for what happens everyone keeps telling them: "You tried your best, and that's ok" in relation to the M8. 
then they think mediocrity is acceptable, and release the M9. Then everyone blasts them for not being creative enough to produce a new device.

Does that make sense?  </TEXT>

Edit: again for the TL;DR people:

**Para 1.:**
On April 23, the New Zealand Herald published, front-page and online, an article about Amanda Bailey and the controversy over her reaction to the Prime Minister, John Key, when he persistently pulled her ponytail at the cafe where she worked as a waitress.

**Para 3.:**
Lisa Finlay, Bronwyn Hayward, Leanne Hermosilla, Josh Hetherington, Rob Stowell, Jasmine Taylor, Giovanni Tiso, Daniel Webster and Julia Woodhall complained that the article breached several Press Council principles.

**Para 2.:**
The Press Council has upheld the substance of the complaints. This is a brief outline; for the full Press Council decision, in two parts, please see www.presscouncil.org.nz. </TEXT>

The severely disjointed flow of this article- especially between paragraph 1 and 2 are extremely discombobulating. I had to read it like 3 times, for thinking there are a sentence or 2 I was missing. 

Paragraphs for the TL;DR crowd:

	<TEXT> No, they give you 15 minutes lee-way at the beginning of the fire process.

After 15 minutes, with most techniques you should have significant combustion of the wood.

Incomplete combustion, (and subsequently waste of wood) results in soot (carbon) in the atmosphere.

So if you have a good fire from kindling, and whack a log that's too big, or wet or contaminated for complete combustion to occur you get smoke/soot. This also causes expensive chimney blockages, and results in less heat being generated. 

So yes it's a pain in the ass, but actually proper techniques, and keep your fire smoke free is significantly better use of your wood, and subsequently cheaper.

	<TEXT> I fully understand a bar is a place to socialize, and alcohol is engrained in or socialization culture. 

However going to be the pub, preloaded and buy only 1 beer, you're contributing to the demise of that pub, I don't know what the $$$ per head need to keep a pub open but it just be quite steep, rent doesn't pay itself! 

A few successful pubs like the Fox have a reward scheme, similar to a subcard, which seems to work. Perhaps if they liked further abroad than just jacking prices we may see more of a scene back again. 

That being said they are giving an uphill battle, in Chch it's stupidly hard to get a liquor license to sell anywhere, but this again makes me wonder why more bars don't look beyond jacking up prices to stay alive. It's not easy to run a business, but it's easy to ruin one.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi /r/GalaxyS5.

Google was no help, so hopefully someone here can shed some light on this issue.

I use phone as a dashcam, and trim a lot of videos.

Recently after upgrading to lollipop when playing back videos in the Trim feature it plays back at 1.3x speed, and doesn't accurately portray the video length you've selected to crop.

I've deleted cache/clear data from "Video Trimmer" App, and disabled, rebooted, reenabled.
I've also cleared data from "Trim" app.

This happens on videos shot from my device, reading from both SD card and internal memory.

Any help or suggestions would be appreciated.

Cheers! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Indeed. I don't know if you recall but a school up north basically gave out Credits for wiping your fucking nose in order to beat the statistics and ensure they got funding! 

I can't find the particular story, [this](http://www.stuff.co.nz/sunday-star-times/latest-edition/318375/NCEA-battered-by-secret-report) is rather damning..

"THE FIRST major analysis of schools' NCEA marking shows many teachers are awarding better grades than examiners do with high-profile schools among the dozens suspected of marking too high.

This means students who shouldn't have passed NCEA may have. Others might have missed out on university entrance because their school marked tougher than others."

	<TEXT> Indeed. I for instance failed miserably at NCEA, and my teachers constantly lamented, saying "why aren't you doing better than this!? I know you're smart, but you fail your exams!" my report is littered with "my name can do better" and I have done better since in the real world - I'm in good employment with a large multinational and earning a very decent wage for my young age.

I'm not saying I'm a special case, but I'm perhaps a bit too atypical  to fit within the NCEA curriculum, and as a result I was frustrated throughout high school as I felt like the exams weren't catered for different learning styles. 

From what I understand there was that leeway under the old school cert that you there were more than one ways to skin a cat, however under NCEA it was just a decision process that was extremely binary and linear. 

Again, fuck you Trevor Mallard (Education Minister at the time) you humongous cunt bag. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Can we just realise for a second that most of the old timers here (well, those 28 and older) sat through a far more robust and time honoured teaching system. 

Kids nowadays are sitting through NCEA, a far cry from the old School Cert system.

NCEA isn't about learning at all, it's about gaining credits through an arbitrary system of points that are seemingly granted at whatever discretion some fuck thought was adequate.

There is no 'teaching' just a series of decisions which leads to more credits, or less credits, which are the used to either pass, or fail a course.

NCEA has totally fucked over our learning system, and this is the culmination of 10 years of tweaking a system that should never have survived the first year. 


Fuck you Trevor Mallard you fucked up you cunt.

I walked out of school in disgust back then, and would do it again in a heartbeat.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The law catches people who want to bludge off our extremely (by world standards) lenient benefit laws. This catches both the extreme criminals, and in her case perhaps someone too naive for her own good. Is it fair? Laws aren't designed to be fair, but to allow as many genuine people through while catching those who will be a (perceived) burden on the system. 

It's literally a game of numbers, and if you have more stacked against you, that's it. Fairness completely aside.  </TEXT>

Will it be enabled by Samsung? Probably not because their marketing team are a pack of sanctimonious fucking assholes!! 

They had the opportunity to release it with lollipop, but chose not to. 

Furthermore when you look into Samsung's cunty decision riddled history you can see multiple instances of them being arrogant fucking douchebags and keeping the latest hardware agnostic software tricks to the latest galaxy rendition only, e.g. Themes on the s6. 

So I would not hold your breath. 

I love Samsung products, but fucking despise the piss poor level of after sales software support. 

Then you look at HTC who readily enabled raw to their one lineup.. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My 2c:

Advertising isn't fixing that culture, in fact given the freedom of our brewery giants with advertising it's a stark contrast, we have "no more Beersies" coupled with some pretty hard hitting alcohol advertising about partying etc. 

Ultimately you can't trust your customers to know when to stop, and pubs make money from selling you overpriced booze, so there's a conflict of interest there. 

I wish I knew how to address things, but seriously New Zealanders like their booze, and have a deeply engrained drinking culture that's going to take some doing to unwind the recent rise in statistics around drunken assaults, and strain on emergency services from drunken tomfoolery. 

I'm no idiot, there is always going a problem, and old people who make the law tend to have stupidly short memories as to what they did when they were young, and that hypocrisy is adding to the problem.  </TEXT>
