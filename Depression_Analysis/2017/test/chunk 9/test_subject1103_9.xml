	<TEXT> I was in your spot last year, so let Senpai, teach you a little something, something.  First off, fuck you. okay now I got that out of the way- see, I'm experiencing  jet lag, CA - Japan yesterday. ok, no more rant. You're in a great position,  at 18 I too got a part time, and made 6k from last December, working 11 hours a week. I go to a state university so tuition  is cheap. it's obvious that you don't know what you're doing,  considering you're asking for such bland advice. Just read some books, ok?  </TEXT>
