	<TEXT> My SO and I split 5 weeks ago. The first two weeks were an absolute nightmare. The third week was much better and now I'm doing just fine.  

Same sort of situation too. 3 years together, she came from money, I didn't. She wanted to be engaged, I don't have the money. She just got her masters degree and is set to live with her parents for a year. We fought about stupid stuff all the time.  

As much as I hated to see her go, in the end it was for the best.   

I was able to finally do what I wanted: move out of Texas. Now I have a job lined up in DC that I will start at the beginning of next month.  

A great book that is helping me get through this is called "How to Survive the Loss of a Love" and I have a copy that I am more than willing to send to you.  

It can be a little preachy at times (I'm not sure if you are religious or not, if you aren't, just look past it) but overall it really puts things into perspective. It taught me to focus on me now.

http://m.dailykos.com/story/2015/06/01/1389699/-BERNIE-COURIC-Interview-Bernie-is-voting-against-USA-FREEDOM-ACT

Sanders, who opposed the Patriot Act and its reauthorization, said he plans to **vote against** the less-wide-ranging USA Freedom Act, passed last month by the House, which would allow some counterterrorism tools  including the NSAs controversial bulk data collection  to remain in place.  

And just in case you don't know exactly what the USA Freedom Act really is:

	<TEXT> Remember the first time Rand Paul filibustered and the top article on Reddit's front page was about it? Remember the first comment? Here's a refresher in case you don't:  

"And Bernie voted YES!"  

That was a load of horse shit. Bernie voted yes for cloture. That means he voted yes to having a vote. He did not vote yes on the bill itself.    

Whatever user made that comment is a smart cookie. He knew reddit never actually reads articles or confirms them with their own research. So what we got was everyone shouting "BERNIE SUPPORTS DOMESTIC SPYING?" when in reality they should've been shouting "BERNIE SUPPORTS THE ABILITY TO VOTE ON THIS BILL!?" which doesn't sound as circlejerky. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was a little shit in elementary school.   

In 5th grade my mother, sister, and I moved out to a rural area from an urban area because my parents separated.   

Coming from an urban school I had this shitty mentality that I was smarter than all of the rural kids. I wasn't very nice to my classmates or teacher. I was a really shitty kid.  

Anyhow, I had a terrible problem turning assignments in, so bad that my teacher did not allow me to participate in the honors program at my school. Naturally I was angered by her actions and over the next couple of days disrespected her constantly! She finally had the last straw, grabbed my arm and dragged me to the front office to retrieve my mother's contact information that was located in a rolodex on a form all students turned in at the beginning of the year.  

She's spinning and searching and finally located my form...

"OF COURSE!" she exclaimed "It's a blank piece of paper because you never turn anything in!"

I just smirked devilishly. 


She brought me back to the classroom and told me to call my mother from the classroom phone. I started to punch in a bunch of random numbers and professed that I didn't remember it (I was lying).

TL;DR: I was a little shit.  </TEXT>

It still said 14. Anyhow, I immediately started the engine in order to run the car for a bit (with the paper clip still in the connector) and the car jumped then completely shut down. Now the dash isn't getting any power, turning the key does nothing. No lights, no A/C, nothing.

	<TEXT> Could old fuel be causing this issue? When it finally gave out it was about 3/4th of the way full. Anyway to responsibly dispose of that gas so I can fill it with fresh gas?   

What's the best way (and cheapest) to look for leaks in the vacuum?   

I have checked around to make sure no wires have been chewed up: all clear.

I cleaned the throttle body like 3 years ago and I recently cleaned the IACV. MAybe I should get a new IACV? </TEXT>

It must have been the mod from Arma 3.

I tried playing a couple of weeks ago with no luck, or maybe that was a DayZ mod for Arma 3. I am having troubles recalling.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A browser you could log into and it would save your bookmarks.

I submitted a business tip to Google back in 2010 about this idea. A year and a half later it was an option in Chrome. 

Would I have liked to be the catalyst in that? Yes.

Is it possible it was already in development before the time of my email? Yes.

I will never know. 

Google, if you are reading this, I am sorry my immature younger self reacted to this situation. In five years I have really grown and now I look back and think: 'how stupid/arrogant were you!'

I graduated with a BA in History but I've been working on computers since I was 9 years old. I am currently 25 and I am called upon in my office when someone's computer is malfunctioning. 99% of the time I fix it, and we HAVE AN **IT** DEPARTMENT!!!!

I've applied to numerous IT positions in the Dallas area and have created a great cover letter to supplment my application that goes over my qualification. I'm getting antsy though! I have on heard back from one employer who asked for an interview, when I told him the times I was available, he never got back to me! 

I have two months to find a position in the Dallas area or I am going to be homeless.  </TEXT>
