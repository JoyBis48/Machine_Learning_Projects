	<TEXT> It's hard to get out of here. I was going to college last year, moved three hours away from home. I was really close to my boyfriend at the time with him only being less than an hour away at a different school.

I went to reapply for this past semester of school and had some issues with my loan and financial aid which forced me to stay this semester. I'm trying to become a forensic entomologist and my small junior college doesn't really handle people in that field which is why I'm trying to get into a major university (Shooting for A M). I found out last week that it's probably not going to happen because the advisors at my school got me into the wrong classes and I have to stay under a minimum 45 cumulative hours in order to get into the department at A M. They literally told me to forget my degree. So that has only brought me down even more.

My mother also broke her arm this past July so it was fortunate I stayed home. I got to take care of her because my father has a job five hours away so he's only home on the weekends. I'm stuck right now. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hello everyone. I am 20 years old, overweight, and gay. Every time I meet someone and things go well, they end up rejecting me or saying they shouldn't be dating right now. I've only had one actual boyfriend. My friends all know that I'm gay, as well as my siblings. My parents are the people I'm working on. Please don't tell me they already know, that's not what I want to hear since I hear it so often from my friends and dates. For everyone else, it's not their business unless I want it to be. I don't care if someone else tells them, but I won't if I don't want to. To get to the point, I go on dates, talk to various guys, meet wonderful men, but can't get someone to take me as theirs. This is what makes me so down and low. Especially right now. I had been seeing this guy for 2 months, and things were so good. I couldn't believe I was able to find someone like him. Then things took a bad turn when I thought to bring up the conversation asking where this was going. Needless to say, I've been rejected. To make matters worse, my bisexual ex, who I have become very good friends with, has met a girl he really likes. He talked about moving to where she was, marrying her in the next few years. I would be fine if I wasn't so jealous that he's doing better than me. I've been to my lowest before, where I twice tried to kill myself. I'm scared about going back down. Every time I meet a great guy, it turns out to be nothing. I'm so tired of being tossed about. I'm so sad and alone, I don't know what to do. All I ever wanted was a companion to be with. I was alone growing up gay in a small rural Texas town, and as an adult, I'm lonelier than ever. I can't stop crying. I just want my pain to stop. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My nana is very content at the nursing she's at. As she's said to me many times, "I got nothing to squawk at." She turned 91 recently and has been in the worst stages of Alzheimer's for the past couple of years. When we went to go see her for her birthday, she called my mother (her daughter) by name instantly. I could've cried. She hasn't known my mothers name in two years. Sometimes it all comes back to her, other days she's lost but happy. All she does is smile. I always bring her chocolates because they're her favorite. She doesn't know who I am but she knows she trusts me and when I look into her eyes it almost as if she's remembering me, but then the moment passes and she goes back to the chocolates. I don't think about her forgetting who we are. I think about if she's happy or not. I always ask, and the answer is always "Definitely." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've all about given up even bothering to date anymore due to my fear of rejection. I personally haven't ever handled it well, and lately being as lonely as I am, I honestly am not sure what would happen if I got rejected, no matter how politely they said it. Yeah someday I could get a yes, but I'm too afraid. For you rejection might be easy. It's not for me. Not by a long shot. Being gay, I could just wait for someone to ask me, but I've had no offers. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My sister, her boyfriend, and I are all struggling with quitting. It's just so satisfying. I started smoking socially while I was drinking, and it evolved to a point where I used to smoke a pack a day. I'm 20!  I usually smoke now when I'm bored. I was so close to quitting last year. It would take a week to two weeks for me to finish a pack. Plus, being a broke college kid and not being able to afford them helped. I'm looking into some alternatives. If anyone had any suggestions, things that have worked for you, I'd be glad to hear some.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> About two months ago I met up with this guy, hit it off, went back to his place to get it on. We started making out and we were having a good time. Then I noticed there wasn't much to grab a hold of while I was exploring. I figured it was just because of the way his dick might've been positioned. I went to go down and unzipped, pulled it out and just looked. This guy had a 2 1/2 to 3 inch dick. I am not joking at all. I wish I was because this guy was really cute. I'm a bottom and so there was no way I thought it would do the job. I didn't say anything, I just blew him, let him finish, pretended to look at my phone and was all "oh shit, I have to go! There's an emergency with a friend of mine!" Didn't see him again. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I live in Texas, which is home to two "Body Farms", belonging to Texas State University at San Marcos, and Sam Houston State University in Huntsville. I'm actually studying to become a forensic entomologist! I am so jealous (as bad as that sounds) that Stephen Fry got to visit one! In Texas, the "Body Farms" are very hard to get in to. They are very strict as to who is allowed in. I heard from a professor of mine that you even need express WRITTEN permission from the Dean, various department heads, etc. My professor has been trying to get into one of them for years with no success, even though she has her PhD in entomology. They had a problem a few years back with students taking cameras, phone, anything that takes photos, into the farm. The bodies are all donated and so the privacy and dignity of the decedent have to be protected, so when that was violated, they tightened the reigns. I'll hopefully be able to get in good words with a few people and maybe one day get in myself! Fingers crossed. If I can't get in, I can always wait until after I die. I plan on donating my body for research to one of these farms. Still, these farms are not just cool for a person like me, they help investigators and researchers out a lot.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you find a wound on the animal, there's a good chance that flies laid eggs in the wound. The main concern is that they can carry disease into the animal, making it sicker. In some cases the maggots actually help, eating the dead tissues (which is what they do) and clean up the wound. Doctors do it to humans, but they of course have access to sterile maggots. Still have the animal checked for infections and such.
Another theory is that it's bot fly larvae which burrow into the skin and incubate until they are ready to fall out and turn into adults. If you find small holes in the skin at central points (spaced/grouped fairly close together) could be bot flies. Have your animal checked just in case though. Hope this helped. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Congrats! So jealous! I'd be focusing on Jinkx the whole time. I have a huge crush on her. I watched all the "Drag Becomes Him" videos and it made me love her even more. So happy you get to see them! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I never thought it a funny read because I loved Sharon, and at that point in the season, I could care less what the fuck PhiPhi thought about anything.
That video just pisses me off. She's so unprofessional. I never liked her, and I never will no matter how much convincing someone did. She's just ugly on the inside. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you can carry your groceries in a small basket like that, they can out them into a bag and you can carry it like that. There's really no need to take it outside to your car. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've seen this in places far from the ghetto. It's just so the baskets don't leave the store. The store I worked for didn't allow the carried baskets to be taken outside. </TEXT>
