	<TITLE> What are your different ways of practicing writing? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-06-29 12:25:39 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I practice by writing short stuff such as freeverse paragraphs and poems, flash fiction, short stories and quotes.

* [Freeverse paragraphs and poems](https://medium.com/word-dust) help me to explore the beauty of language.
* Flash fiction helps me in sharpening the skill of developing an engaging fictional pieces.
*  Short stories challenge me to shape a story that has the main elements of storytelling, such as conflict, purpose, character and etc.
* Quotes help me to understand myself better. They act as self-advices. 

These are the ways in which I practice my writing. In what ways do you practice yours?

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Ever since I read Gitanjali by Tagore I understood the potential of writers who win Nobels in Literature. So, from then on every now and then I pick up something written by Nobel laureates. As of now I've read:

* Tagore (Gitanjali)
* Herman Hesse (Siddhartha; Steppenwolf)
* Ernst Hemingway (The Old Man and the Sea)
* John Steinbeck (Of Mice and Men; The Pearl)

I realized that I prefer short novels of such people which gives a glimpse of the kind of work they do and the type of stories they tell. 

From the above list, only Ernest Hemingway's book *The Old Man and the Sea* bored me badly (sorry, fans). Rest of them were somewhere between good to great reads. 

What are your favourite (preferrably short) works from Nobel winners in literature? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Probably off topic, but I want to ask suggestions from you guys about 'storytelling' in the literal sense. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-06-24 07:37:52 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm an aspiring writer. And I also want to develop my storytelling skills. By 'storytelling' I mean actually telling them, not just in text but in voice, by speaking it out, by narrating it. 

I'm sure many of you guys are not only great writers of stories but also engaging tellers of those stories. I sincerely believe that there is a fine bit of difference between writing a story and telling it out for others. The biggest difference that I can argue about is that a written story is usually for people who read, and there are many, many people around the world who don't read (novels and such) but I'm sure no one is possibly averse to listening to a great story that's being told to them. (I also think this is a reason that makes movies differ from books, in a way.)

Please help me by giving some suggestions on:

* how to develop this skill 
* what kind of story suits better to be told than to write (if)
* what body language affects people in storytelling process
* how to engage your audience better when you're telling them a story

and anything else that you think would be important for a good story teller.

I'm really counting on this as it's very important for what I'm trying to do.

Thank you so much, guys. You're awesome :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't do that very much although I buy lots of books when they're available at good prices. I keep them for future reading. But I've a childhood friend of mine who likes very much to shop books but never reads much of them at all. I also think that my friend never actually finished any single book in his life.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'M 25 AND VERY AMBITIOUS AND ASPIRING. BUT THE THINGS THAT I'M DOING IN MY LIFE RIGHT NOW ARE NOT IN FUCKING UNISON WITH ANYTHING. THAT'S THE BIGGEST MOTHERFUCKING PROBLEM I'M FACING RIGHT NOW. I'M FIGHTING WITH MYSELF. I MUST. 

I WASTE A HELL LOT OF FUCKING TIME BY GETTING LOST IN A BUZZ OF THOUGHTS IN MY MIND THAT KEEPS MY FROM WORKING TOWARDS MY LIFE'S CONCERNS. I REALIZED THAT IT IS MY FUCKING PROBLEM. THE BUZZ. I SHOULD CONTROL IT. FUCKING TIE IT DOWN BY ITS NECK AND HANG IT TO DEATH. SO THAT IT WON'T TROUBLE ME IN ACHIEVING MY CONCERNS.

I HAVE THE FOLLOWING CONCERNS FOR MY BEAUTIFUL LIFE. THESE ARE ALL THE THINGS THAT MY HEART ALWAYS WANTS, AND THAT DIRECTLY AFFECT MY LIFE. I WANT TO DEDICATE THE NEXT FEW YEARS OF MY LIFE COMPLETELY TO THESE THINGS BY ABANDONING EVERYTHING ELSE THAT IS PETTY.

* **MBA ENTRANCE EXAM**- AIMING FOR SOME PREMIER INSTITUTES
* **JOB** - TO DO WELL IN THE CURRENT ONE AND LEARN GOOD DEAL OF SKILLS
* **READING BOOKS** - I NEED THIS BECAUSE I'M AN ASPIRING WRITER
* **WRITING** - OH THIS IS AFTER ALL MY LIFE'S WHOLE POINT AND PURPOSE. I GOTTA WRITE. FICTION. NON-FICTION. POETRY. SHORT STORIES. I JUST WANT TO WANDER AND FLY AND DIVE IN THE WORLD OF WORDS.

WHAT ARE YOUR CONCERNS IN LIFE, BROTHERS, AND WHAT IS IT THAT'S STOPPING YOU IN THE JOURNEY? LET'S TALK TO ONE ANOTHER ABOUT THEM. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> LAST WEEKEND HAD BEEN A FUCKING DISAPPOINTMENT </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-06-17 16:55:47 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I WOKE UP EARLY MORNING AT 5AM AND STUDIED FOR A LITTLE WHILE. ONLY FOR A FUCKING LITTLE WHILE. AND THEN AT 7AM I HAD TO TAKE AN ONLINE MOCKTEST FOR AN EXAM I'M PREPARING. THE TEST WAS OF NEARLY 3 HOURS. I REALLY FELT THAT I PERFORMED WELL IN ONE SECTION OF THE TEST. SO, I WAS LOOKING FORWARD FOR THE RESULTS. BUT WHEN I SUBMITTED MY TEST, THE GODDAMN SERVER FAILED. IT FUCKING FAILED. AND LIKE THAT BEGAN MY ONE OF THE MOST DISAPPOINTING WEEKENDS IN THE RECENT TIMES.

AT 12PM I WENT TO THE COACHING CLASSES THAT I ENROLLED INTO FOR THE EXAM PREP. AND SLOWLY AFTER A COUPLE OF HOURS OF CLASS I STARTED FEELING SLEEPY (BECAUSE I WASN'T HAVING ENOUGH SLEEP OVER THE WEEK DUE TO WORK AND STUFF LIKE THAT). AFTER 2PM A NEW CLASS HAS STARTED WHERE AN IMPORTANT MATH TOPIC WAS GOING ON 'PERMUTATIONS   COMBINATIONS.' AND I WAS HARDLY ABLE TO KEEP MY EYES OPEN DUE TO THE GODDAMN DROWSINESS. BY TRYING TO KEEP MYSELF FROM SLEEP IN THE CLASS, I STARTED TO GET HEADACHE. AND LIKE THAT I LOST THE ENTIRE LECTURE AND I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND ANYTHING.

FIRST THE TEST'S SERVER PROBLEM WHICH LOST ME MY PERFORMANCE CHECK. AND THEN BEING A SLEEPYFUCKINGHEAD PISSED ME OFF SO MUCH.

ALSO RECENTLY MANY THINGS IN MY LIFE RIGHT NOW ARE GOING BAD. MOSTLY THIS EXAM THING. MAN, I'M SO NOT DOING JUSTICE TO IT. </TEXT>
