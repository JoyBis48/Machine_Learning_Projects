	<TEXT> Over the past 2 years I've lost just under 40 pounds with just exercising and not changing my diet.  I'd say I've been averaging about 25-30 miles per week running and 45 minutes of weights 3-4 days a week.  Of course changing up my diet would have sped up the weight loss process, but I didn't want to have to change up my eating and drinking habits in order to lose the weight.  So it is possible to lose weight without eating less, but it will take longer to get to your goals. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Would there be any advantage to changing up the type of interval running I do? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-05-30 17:20:20 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I've been running for several years and around last October I initially began increasing my speed for short periods during one run a week.  This turned into a sort of interval run for me where I alternate between 1/2 mile at slow pace and 1/4 mile at the sprinting pace and then the final sprint I push myself for .4 miles.  Over time I've been increasing the speeds, and I can definitely tell it's helping.  My natural pace went from about 7.1 mph to 8.0 over the past 6 months.  

Recently I started wondering if trying out a different system of interval running would be beneficial, or if it would essentially be as effective as what I'm currently doing.  I was thinking of possibly a pyramid interval in order to try to get longer distances in during my sprinting portions.  I don't really have a specific goal that I'm working to attain.  Aside from natural buildup for better speed and endurance.  Just wondering if there would be any benefit by changing things up a little bit. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The reason why race wins in NASCAR aren't really comparable to wins in other sports is because in other sports you only have 2 teams competing heads up.  So you have 1 team getting a win and 1 team getting a loss.  In NASCAR you have all 43 teams competing in the same event at the same time.  So to use a win loss record in NASCAR you would actually have 42 teams getting a loss on their record each week regardless if they finished 2nd or 42nd.  To sort of relate it to your comment here about playing it safe, you could technically say if a driver finishes 7th they lost to 6 teams, but won against 36 others. </TEXT>
