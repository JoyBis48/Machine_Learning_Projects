	<TITLE> Should horror music be unpleasant? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-06-03 21:26:48 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I need music for a short film and was curious about your opinions on this. While there are some excellent scores like the one for Psycho or Suspiria, they never really make me scared because the music is so good that it becomes thrilling instead of creepy. To me the most effective music I ever heard in a horror movie was the score for Texas Chainsaw Massacre, which is really ugly and uncomfortable: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3odOfyPz8L8

Would you recommend going more for music that's easier to listen to or going more the discordant and creepy route?

	<TEXT> You know, an older Alex DeLarge deciding that he's bored with going around inflicting the old ultraviolence and that he's going to go live a normal life. 

I always thought that was kind of fucked up in how nihilistic it was. That it's supposed to be alright that even though DeLarge was a murderer/rapist, it's fine now because he's stopped and all his victims should just let it go/be ignored. But anyway...

Isn't that kind of inconsistent with how human beings really act? Don't psychopaths not just bored with what they're doing in real life? Isn't it much more likely that DeLarge is just going to keep raping people than that he'll just stop committing crimes?  </TEXT>

I tried to keep it objectively about the quality of the costumes and the photos and keep any sex appeal out of it. I guess you could arge a lot of the appeal for the photos has more to do with post-production than with the model, but still I've also found there's only so much you can photoshop a dud performer.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Watching Jupiter Ascending, I was thinking about how wonderful it all looked, but that the movie's insistence on a fairly generic adventure story kept getting in the way of fully enjoying it. I wondered what movies out there would best allow for just immersing yourself in it, and it seemed to me that it would probably be character pieces and/other eye candy comedies. Are there any like that which come to mind? 

I know there are options like Blade Runner and Dark City, but I was hoping for a break from the more dour stuff.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't know how I managed it, but when I went to see Gone Girl last year, I knew literally nothing about it except that David Fincher had directed it which I believe massively enhanced the experience for me. I still don't really know what some upcoming new movies are about, but I've heard excellent general things about them so I'm looking forward to being able to go into them blind as well. 

This goes completely against my old habits where I would get excited for movies and read several reviews of them, and in hindsight the process would diminish the movies a bit when I saw them in.
