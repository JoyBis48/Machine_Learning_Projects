	<TITLE> Hopeless after strong mushroom trip </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-04-28 01:05:42 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Had a strong mushroom trip on 5 grams about 6 months ago.

I feel like we are alone in the universe and that "happiness" only exists so that evolution can do it's dirty work. I feel like everything we do will be returned to dust and will decompose. I feel like everyone I will ever know and love will stop existing and perish. I understand that consciousness is also an illusion so that we can keep on reproducing. Even though we already have 7 billion and a climate problem.

I feel terrified and alone. I have been like this for too long and I am lost.

God doesnt exist and life is meaningless. </TEXT>

Based on research and statistics; is the consensus to buy or sell your bitoin right now?

Some forecast websites say it is about to fall while others say it will rise to $800USD by the end of the year. I was seriously considering selling about half of my bitcoin because of the potential drop in value and I already lost a lot of money with the other drops in the past. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Strange heroic acid trip report, </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-02-19 13:03:24 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I took about 5 Tabs last week apparently it was very pure stuff. During the peak of the trip I saw a vision of dancing elves with hats around a glowing box. They were dancing around in a circle. I felt as if my whole life and the whole existence of the universe was a movie and inside the box was the ending, the plot twist of the movie. The box suddenly opened and everything suddenly changed and felt different. All the pieces to the puzzle fit in and my heart started racing as if the whole universe existed just so that it could build up and produce this one glorious moment. Like an explosion all this information came out of the box in a state of euphoria for about 5 minutes everything became black this is when the trip went bad and I felt like I was losing my mind. Like I had a taste of the fruit of eden and am now being punished. Like curiousity killed the cat. After the trip it was hard to remember it in detail and only now am I piecing it together. Im fine now and im over the bad part of the trip. 

The room with the dancing elves was a bit like glowball which is a game on android.

Why? Because when you are together 40 years in the future she will wish more than anything that your relationship has gone this way. None of this bullshit negativity and depression.

You take the psychedelic and you know the effects will take place in an hour. You sit in the beach and the water starts to recede, you feel the fear and anticipation of what is about to take place. The birds flock away and the wind starts to blow violently. The fear builds and as a result you feel the need to control it so you look around but there are no trees or bars; nothing to hold onto. 

You push your hand through the sand to find something; anything to grab onto but it is useless. The sand runs through your fingers and refuses a grip. You come to accept your fate. The massive wave in the background slowly approaches and you know that you have to face it head on.

 The gigantic being destroys everything in its path. It is both terryfying but it has its own majesty and beauty. As it moves on everything calms down and you have a new understanding; you feel refreshed and clear headed. Novelty has washed on the beach and a lot of filth was destroyed in the process. </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2014-12-03 13:03:27 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> As you know the structures are almost identical except for the one hydroxyl group.

DMT:

http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/88/DMT.svg

Psilocin:

http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/92/Psilocin.svg

So would they bind to the same receptors? I know that there is a big difference between mushrooms and LSD as the latter is known for binding to dopamine receptors such as D5 and D2. While mushrooms are focused mainly on the serotonin receptors exclusively.

How do mushrooms play a role with the pineal gland?

Does DMT have the same binding affinities as the Psilocin in mushrooms?

If it does indeed bind to almost all the same receptors; both experiences should be theoretically similar. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> After taking mushrooms and acid several times; I feel like the majority of the human race are brainwashed and is on autopilot. I feel like not many people are doing things in an intelligent geniuine way and that most are following any impulse they come across. 

I have no interest in hanging out with my current friends, watching tv, or any tv shows, video games, youtube etc. Eating trashy foods. (This is a good thing). Right now I would prefer a relationship with someone I am deeply in love with and a mostly solitary life where I work and get my degree and explore what else life has to offer.

I am not really into conspiracy theories but I think about had a message that was on point. Also talks from speakers such as Terrence Mckenna. The whole idea about primal individual freedom and abandoning systems and culture.

	<TEXT> I think the movie fight club was right I watched it back around when it came out, this lifestyle of working 9-5 or studying perpetually for exams is disastrous for human happiness. Given our origins of hunter gatherer culture and moments that required us to act quick with adrenaline pumping and "life or death" doesn't happen anymore. It's repetitive work for almost everyone whether you are in a job or still studying.

I participated in this lifestyle feeling unsatisfied and I even blamed myself saying that I was too lazy. But every day I sit down and pour hours and effort into studies I feel myself dying down to a sort of conformist lobotomized state. Tragically the day where there was a shooting nearby and police everywhere was the only moment I felt alive and aware because at least it's not the same old boring shit regardless of if it's threatening to my life or not. Something like a mastermind theif or a heist planner seems more exciting and alive.


Or if things erupt into anarchy I wouldn't mind either i'm sick of the top 1% being what they are who aren't even happy or if they look happy are chronically delusional. You might not understand what I am saying but to those who do you can definitely relate. I somewhat believe in the anarchic unabomber manifesto.
