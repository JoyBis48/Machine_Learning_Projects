	<TEXT> I have a feeling that would be true with ABS, but PLA printed a little hot (200-205C) with 20% infill tends to bond well. You could print it on it's side with support without much trouble if you had splitting problems. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes on the bulldozers. The tires are rated 8-20PSI. At 8 there is significant resistance. Today I commuted 3 miles with 18PSI. It was not bad at all. Slower than my road bike, but easy to keep a good cruising speed and doesn't pull in turns. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ham isn't obsolete but it is undergoing a shift. It's always been way more targetted to hackers. Now that the hacker/maker community is growing some interesting developments have been happening. New protocols, space balloons, and software defined radio have not (yet) been made obsolete by the internets.

Then there's Echolink, which is a neat mashup. </TEXT>
