	<TEXT> You run across those guys every once in a while. Really, 5 tours just means you've been thru it a couple times, no real difference if you're trying to do good and interested in learning. Playing with triple digits is where the fun really starts, you can goof around and try stuff, and your ass is constantly covered.  
But I've only been kicked once, and it was because I was taking a bathroom break real quick, but it was a team of tryhards, so whatever. I have kicked a few, but never because of the number of tours.  
But I have found, that until you start to get an idea of the roles, playing the meta classes will help keep you from getting kicked. The meta is definitely over-rated, it's more about roles than classes, but folks generally are much more patient with meta classes.  

couple a quick engie tips: The robots will instantly destroy anything they touch except the sentry, so place teles and dispensers wisely.  Put exits in spots that are still useful if you're pushed back a bit.  
First thing you should upgrade on the first wave is dispenser range. Max it out right from the start. Personally, I also max out canteen instant upgrades as well right from the start, and keep them maxed.  Dispenser building and movement is the priority over your sentry, get it up first, your team mates will love you all the more (unless you need to quickly block.)  Rescue ranger is awesome, but make sure you try to keep over 130 metal so you can move stuff quick.  Never waste credits on the mini sentry, unless you have a ton o cash and kinda make it known that you have the extra cash so folks don't bitch, cause they will.  The jag only adds 15% speed, not 30%, so it's not a necessity.  2 way teles are only really needed on a few maps, so don't sacrifice the cash for them unless they're needed.  Try to block with the sentry, it's a huge asset in dealing with giant scouts, remember the robot needs to see a bit of room between it and the corner or object you're blocking with, otherwise it will go around, give it just enough room for you to walk through, they are bigger than you.  Upgrade wrench speed before firing speed, because when you bang on your sentry it adds ammo before it repairs, so if you're firing too fast you'll be doing far less repairing, and it's much harder to keep it up when it's getting bombed on. I never upgrade firing speed completely, only 1 or 2 in that upgrade.  As you get a bit of experience, and learn where people are attacking from, don't be afraid to move your dispenser around a bit. It's mostly ignored unless they don't have another target, but don't put it in the middle of everyone since it'll get splash damage. Make sure you put 1 point in metal capacity at the start as well, you can build both a sentry and a dispenser at the same time when you're full up.

edits: oh yeah, while it's the scout's (or whoever is being the money collector) main duty to get the cash, it's actually everyone's job. Grab the cash around you as you can, but make sure to get it if you're away from others. And remember, you can still get your credits back before the first wave starts. The minus signs are still there, so if you need to change things and have the time, you can. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The odds that you're being kicked only because you're a zero tour is really low. It's rare that I see a zero tour kicked just because. Almost every kick I see is from someone not listening, or don't have settings on to hear mics, or something along those lines. When I see a low tour with funky upgrades, I'll mention it. If they get defensive instead of asking about it, it's a pretty good indicator that someone will throw up a vote at some point. Sure, there are asshats who will kick just because, but they aren't nearly as prevalent as you seem to think.   

Want to not get kicked? Listen to high tours, or if no advice is forthcoming, ask. Read through forums, do a bit of research first. People trade for or pay a dollar for every mission, so it kind of pisses people off when someone won't do the legwork to be a contributor. Look through your friends' profiles and check out their badges. See who has some experience, ask for invites when you see them playing.  

Research, listen, ask, and you should very rarely get kicked. And don't take offence when a 4 tour wants to kick you. He knows about as much as you, and you'd probably have a better time on another team anyway.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I just got my service disconnected. I had plenty of credit, but they were taking even more out of my account. I didn't see it coming, didn't go over my usage. I finally got tired of working for the savings with support and told the rep to just refund my credit and drop the service. Basically I paid $25 bucks for a crappy  phone, and I don't know how much in cheap, experimental  service with lag and variable quality.   

I tried something new, it didn't work out, but at least everything was fairly cheap all around and I didn't lose that much money.  

My advice to others who ask about it is to just skip it and go with Straight Talk or the like. In the end it's just not worth the hassle.

	<TEXT> "Restart the button!" "It was a glitch!" "It should count down from natural causes, not technical issues!"  

Yes, it died from a glitch instead of a natural lack of pressers. But that's life. We don't get do-overs. We don't get to chose to restart from scratch. Once something is dead, mourn it, but don't disrespect it by reviving it (and I'm betting they will find another excuse later on.) It is tainted now, it isn't what it was, it's life from here on out will be accompanied by a *footnote.  

It died. Sorry it didn't die some grand death, with thousands of people trying to remember their alt account's password to scramble to keep it going. Sometimes things just leave us unexpectedly and suddenly, without preamble or fanfare.  

Deal with it, or keep cheating the button of the awesomeness it deserved. I was grey when it died, and had planned on trying for red. But as far as I'm concerned, I let myself get stuck with gray, so gray I shall stay. It's only right. I'd rather not be asked "did you click before the crash or after?" anytime flairs come up in the future. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes, the button should be done. I personally want to see it keep going, but if it stops, for whatever reason, it stops. Restarting the button means that from this moment on, anything done with it will always have an asterisk after it. It stopped. People didn't want to see it stopped, so they restarted it. Now we know they will do this any time they wish, whenever they can find a decent argument for it. It's tainted now. Press if you wish, but as far as I'm concerned it's all a big cheat now.  </TEXT>
