	<TEXT> I'm sorry to hear that. That sounds excruciatingly painful. Was it an LFT? That is a common liver test that can be indicative of gallbladder problems. Have they talked about having the dumb thing removed? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Meh, been better. I did well on my test this week (I'm in grad school), and got to go climbing tonight. But I was blind sided-ly broken up with by a girl I'd been seeing for 3 weeks. Things were going great until she went on a double date as a favor for a friend and decided to date the other guy instead :( Sorry to hear about the gallbladder attack, may I ask what is wrong? I am in the medical field and am naturally curious about this stuff. </TEXT>
