	<TEXT> For a minute I thought today was Juneteenth. 

[Juneteenth is the oldest known celebration commemorating the ending of slavery in the United States.  Dating back to 1865, it was on June 19th that the Union soldiers, led by Major General Gordon Granger, landed at Galveston, Texas with news that the war had ended and that the enslaved were now free. Note that this was two and a half years after President Lincolns Emancipation Proclamation - which had become official January 1, 1863. The Emancipation Proclamation had little impact on the Texans due to the minimal number of Union troops to enforce the new Executive Order. However, with the surrender of General Lee in April of 1865, and the arrival of General Grangers regiment, the forces were finally strong enough to influence and overcome the resistance.](http://www.juneteenth.com/history.htm) </TEXT>

Sen. Bernie Sanders On How Democrats Lost White Voters
Sanders was an organizer for the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and participated in the historic March on Washington in 1963 as a 22-year-old student at the University of Chicago. "It was a question for me of just basic justice  the fact that it was not acceptable in America at that point that you had large numbers of African-Americans who couldn't vote, who couldn't eat in a restaurant, whose kids were going to segregated schools, who couldn't get hotel accommodations living in segregated housing," he told the Burlington Free Press. "That was clearly a major American injustice and something that had to be dealt with."](http://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2015/04/29/399818581/5-things-you-should-know-about-bernie-sanders).

	<TEXT> This is a perfect depiction of the united states under the GOP threat. Class warfare, abysmal treatment of those who do the fucking work. I'm past the point for having pity for the stupid fucks who vote GOP. Now I consider them part of the threat.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> But the pot thing hasn't been "fixed" by legalizing it. The states that did legalize are being sued by other states, and still dealing with MASSIVE issues because of the federal ban. It still needs to be fixed at the fed level to be legit.

And your PS makes me think you're high right now.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I haven't been but I am way more paranoid about it post-legalization than I ever was for the 2 decades when pot was illegal. Definitely think that CO plates are profiled. I was actually told by the cashier at  Target (discussing going on a drive out of state) that I should be prepared, they pull over Colorado cars at the border. She was talking about going north out of CO. I thought it was a weird convo to have with an older woman cashier at Target, but hey.  </TEXT>

The following year, he pleaded no contest to disturbing the peace in relation to a domestic violence charge involving a woman with whom he had been living; he was sentenced to four days in jail, three years' probation, and mandatory drug counseling.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Adler#1990.E2.80.932002:_Post-Guns_N.27_Roses_troubles_and_hiatus) </TEXT>
