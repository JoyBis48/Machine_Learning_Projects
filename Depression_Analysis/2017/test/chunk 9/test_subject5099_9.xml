	<TEXT> This post is more located here for the fact I can't put it in a place people know me because it would be rude and against guidelines.

I've posted here before, I've given up before, and I find no guarantee I will kill myself today, but I sure really want to and will think of a way to. I don't find hooe in the world, as I'm lonely and destructive in friendships, and most people end up hating me. I'm sorry to all those that I hurt, especially her, and I'm sorry that I was such a stupid ugly person that only annoyed others.

I'm sorry. </TEXT>
