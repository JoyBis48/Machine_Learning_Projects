	<TEXT> It was just another day. Though, this day he was Jennifer.

He knew so thanks to the alarm on his phone that must have been going off for two minutes already. The screen read: "GET UP JENNIFER! Seriously, last chance if you want makeup today." He didn't.

After the second snooze wore off and the alarm sounded again, he forced himself out of bed and found his way to the bathroom. It was always awkward being a girl, even more so a teenage girl. As usual, he lifted his nightshirt to check himself out. *Could be worse*, he thought. And it could have been. He recalled the terrible day he woke up as middle school principal's secretary Shelia. Ugly, overweight, married to some bad-breath slob who tried for morning snuggles. That day was a living nightmare. Screw Shelia.

He found some clothes that looked what he would consider to be cute, tied his hair in a bun, skipped the makeup, and went downstairs. There was commotion in the kitchen. His mom started as soon as he walked in.

"Jennifer, are you kidding me? You're going to be late for school! I packed you a lunch, it's on the counter. Please get your stuff and get your brother to school on time." He knew it was his mom because he wasn't stupid. Also, he had done this many times before. Different people, different names, same story. He mumbled something so that his mother would know he had heard her, retrieved his purple backpack, and then grabbed his lunch off of the kitchen counter. Little brother was waiting at the door before he, Jennifer, could grab the keys to what he hoped would be his own car. He followed the boy out into the garage and into the red Prius. *Ew, that kind of Jennifer.* 

He didn't know how to get to the middle school, much less his own school, which he assumed was a local high school. 
 
"Can you tell me how to get to your school?" 

"Real funny, Jen. You take me to school every single day."

"I know. It's...just a test." This wasn't his first rodeo. Little brothers love to be challenged. 

They made it to Caddo Middle School as the bell rang. He smiled and waved by to his brother before rummaging through his backpack for clues as to where Jennifer attended. It was easy to locate, park, and even attend classes, talking to friends who spoke first and remaining quiet and passive in class. Everything went downhill at volleyball practice.

Coach Bates was a frumpy male-looking female--short graying hair, sagging skin, and a voice that was uncomfortably deep. Apparently, Jennifer was supposed to be one of Coach Bates' best athletes, at least when it came to hitting a white ball over a suspended net. And while Jennifer might have been swift and agile in her own body, he most definitely was not. He couldn't fake it either. Halfway through practice, Coach sent him back to the locker room to change. He was a little embarrassed, but he didn't really care. Jennifer would have to be the one to put up with the consequences of today, tomorrow. 

As he pulled off his sports bra, he heard a noise. Instinctively, he covered his chest and looked around the room. He was alone. Everyone else was at practice. 

Slowly, he walked through the aisle between the lockers, stopping at one that seemed to be rattling. Pulling the locker opened, three high school boys tumbled out onto the locker room floor in a panic. It was an accident. They didn't mean to. It was Cliff's idea. All sorts of excuses came spilling out of their mouths. None of them were true. It was obvious, they wanted to see some naked girls and that's that. Jennifer wasn't having it. 

He dropped her bra. The boys gasped. He reached down for Cliff's hand, beckoning him to stand. He did. Jennifer leaned in, his chest against Cliff's, and whispered in his ear. "Don't let me *ever* see you in here again." He reared back and then slammed his fragile little hand into Cliff's nose. He howled in pain. The three boys ran out of the locker room, two laughing, one crying. 

Later that night he lay in bed remembering the events of the strange day. It wasn't the only strange day he had had. Most, in fact, were awkward to some degree. He was sure that he had broken Jennifer's hand. He tried to hide it from mom, but she had noticed and bandaged it up until they could have the school nurse look at it in the morning. He couldn't even begin to imagine how confused Jennifer would be tomorrow. A broken hand, a few new enemies at school, an angry coach, and a fresh new key scratch down the side of her precious Prius. But, none of it was his problem anymore.

Tomorrow he could quite possibly be a Rick or a Dave or Juan. He might even wake up as Coach Bates. He never knew what to expect. Today, he had been Jennifer. It was just another day. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> *Just saw this. Thought it was beautiful. Didn't have permission, but was inspired and wanted to edit it a bit. Great work /u/kappakappapie!*

The boy who lived realized that his time to die would soon come. Magic had sustained him far past the age of any normal human being. He had seen and experienced many wonderful things throughout his extended years, but very few moments were as precious as this one. Harry watched as one of his great grandchildren sat under the Sorting Hat. That hat always had a way of surprising Harry, even when it came to his own flesh and blood. He grinned as the Sorting Hat called out Hufflepuff and a section of the Great Hall erupted into a raucous applause.   

Family was rarely allowed to attend the Sorting, but this was a small favor granted Harry from an old friend who had recently become a beloved headmaster. Though most of the students and even some of the professors wouldnt recognize him in his late age, save for his notorious scar, he didnt want to make a scene. Harry wrapped the generational cloak around his shoulders, covered his head, and disappeared from sight.

He walked slowly the aging halls of Hogwarts until his memories carried him out of the castle and onto the grounds. The groundkeepers cabin still shone in the darkness, bordering his intended destination. It would always be Hagrids house to Harry. Tears began to well up in his eyes as he recalled the many adventures he had shared with his best friends. Hermoine, Ron, and he would make frequent late night visits to Hagrids hut, hidden only by the invisibility cloak that he now wore. It had been many years since Harry had attended each of their funerals, but his feelings for his lifes closest friends had never diminished. 

Suddenly, the Forbidden Forest was in front of him, as dark and imposing as ever. Harry slid his cloak off of his shoulders and tucked it into the satchel hanging at his side. He patted the leather carrier closed, trusting that his belongings would be returned to his next of kin.

It took him a while, but he finally found what he had returned to the forest to recover. A small smooth stone. It had been pressed deep into the dirt, covered over many times by passing students, centaur, and forest creatures alike. His bones creaked as he stood to examine the long forgotten Hallow, the only magic strong enough to bring back lost loved ones, even if only for a brief moment.

He longed to once again see his family and friends, but knew that wish would be granted only a short time from now. No. Who he sought today, with his fleeting strength, was someone different; someone else from his past that had left a lasting impression on Harrys life.

Harry closed his eyes and turned the stone over three times in his hand.

Tom Riddle stood before him. Rather, a shade of the man who had, many years ago, become Voldemort looked back at Harry in disbelief and bewilderment. There was still anger, still fear in Toms eyes. 

Harry shook his head and waved a dismissive hand at Tom. 

Our contest has long since passed, old friend. The years have made me what some would call wiser, but perhaps we all simply learn to forgive, given enough time. Harry limped forward until he was face-to-face with the apparition of a man he never truly met. Do not be troubled, Tom. You were never meant for this world. It was especially cruel to you. You only chose to react in kind.

Harry breathed deeply, then spoke in a whisper. We both fear death, dont we Tom? Weve escaped it in different ways, weve made different choices along the way, but here we both arein between.

A cold wind rustled the trees. A wolf howled in the distance. And Harrys heart slowed its beat.

Thats why I came here tonight. Together we can move on from this world and into the final adventure that is death. Prophecies and cruelty of the past made us enemies. Perhaps it is our destiny to move from it as friends.

As Harry sunk to his knees and the stone from his hand, he was sure that as the image faded from sight he saw a glint in Toms eye. For the final time, Death loomed over Harry Potter. Harry smiled and nodded, welcoming Death as a friend. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> ^^Preface: ^^I ^^know ^^that ^^there ^^have ^^probably ^^been ^^other ^^posts ^^such ^^as ^^this ^^one, ^^but ^^due ^^to ^^my ^^excitement, ^^I ^^just ^^had ^^to ^^make ^^one ^^of ^^my ^^own. ^^Carry ^^on.

I came home from Thanksgiving travels today and sat down at the computer, downloaded Patch 3, and started up Unity. For the first time, I was able to open the game online without a single crash. For the first time, I was able to up all graphics to max settings and saw very few graphical issues (970 for those wondering). For the first time, I was able to open a blue Companion App chest *and* a yellow Initiate's chest. For the first time, I was able to play a co-op mission in all of it's splendor. For the first time, I was able to play AC:U as it was meant to be played...and it was awesome.

I would love to connect with some of you via co-op because I can only imagine how could missions would be with skilled assassins by my side. Feel free to PM me or post your detail below.

I am excited once again. This does not excuse what Ubisoft did with the launch of an unfinished game. But I am finally content with being able to experience AC:U in the way it was meant to be played.  </TEXT>
