	<TEXT> This is retarded. Yes, technically bodies decompose and release their chemicals into the air. However, for it to 'scatter across the cosmos' it would have to leave Earth in the first place, and it won't. And even if it does... so what. It's just a bunch of chemicals. It's no more meaningful than one of his broken nails decomposing to feed a plant.

And he's definitely not watching over us, that's just retarded. He's a fucking corpse in the ground and his neurons stopped firing. </TEXT>

In fact, I'd say in most companies the CEO has industry experience.

Most of the big name CEOs that inherited their wealth or cross sell to industries they know nothing about are in the minority. There's are thousands upon thousands of companies around the world and most would hire CEOs that know what they're doing. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's not entirely fair to compare the effects of legalising prostitution in one country to another, BUT, in the first world countries where it is legal, the work conditions actually seem pretty good and it doesn't seem like anyone is being taken advantage of.

Completely legal in my country and I have a friend who is a friend with a prostitute and says she loves her job and so do her coworkers. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Probably because of the theme. We've seen Batman vs Anarchistic villains a dozen times by now.

This is the first live action film to show Batman trying to take down another hero, and a hero significantly more powerful then him. It's Batman vs a God. It's Batman doing what he believes is right and, for once, might actually clash with the audiences views. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Michael E. Uslan is an executive producer of the movie The Dark Knight Rises </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Just a quick one today folks. I was going through my daily watching of The Dark Knight Rises and noticed something in the end credits. If you look closely at the center of the screen, eventually you will see some white characters appear against the black backdrop. I took a [screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/8nsconP.png) on youtube to assist.

If you can make out the white characters, it appears to say something along the lines of "Executive Producers - Benjamin Melniker and Michael E. Uslan"

I believe this is a possible hint towards the identity of two of the executive producers who worked on the movie, one of which is Michael E. Uslan. It's possible that this Benjamin Melniker is also an executive producer but I haven't quite finished analysing that part of the text.

And before anyone asks how I managed to notice such a detail, it's because I have a PhD in film studies (currently doing my thesis on The Dark Knight Rises, specifically about Batman's identity - which I believe to be Bruce Wayne). </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Would this build be viable for Death March? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-07-09 05:29:01 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I started a Signs based build because I didn't realise how easy it was to replenish potions (thought I'd be using them too sparingly to bother putting points in that tree). However, after realising their are restored by alcohol I've been using them a lot and I'm thinking of respecing into an Alchemy build. I don't like bombs, so I'm thinking of doing the following build:

http://www.gosunoob.com/witcher-3/skill-calculator/?combat=115 sign=153 alchemy=115_125_143_225_252_323_345_415 general=321

Some explanation:
-Deliberately didn't max some skills
-Muscle Memory to 5/5 (just for a bit of extra damage)
-Delusion to 3/3 (just for a bit of a boost of stamina + dialogue options)
-Not interested in using bombs, I'd rather stick to a signs build if bombs are necessary for an Alchemy build to work
-Would place Synergy with a strong red mutagen
-Rage management to help keep Quen up
-Skipped delayed recovery as potions should already last a long time
-Refreshment I'm on the fence about as Swallow already will last a long time with this build
-Frenzy just sounds obnoxious to use, so I skipped it
-Oils seems good all round, but I'm skipping the last skill because I feel like my adrenaline will be used for the occasional sign due to my playstyle.
-My remaining two slots would likely go to a point or two in a sign skill, or maybe some of the yellow skills, but honestly, I don't know if I'm liking to reach this level on a single playthrough due to how slow leveling is. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't like her, but she's not saying she doesn't care or others shouldn't care.

She's criticising the liberals for caring about fast food wages even though (she, for some reason, believes) they want to eliminate fast food and make everyone go vegan. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes, but we're talking about Superman's motivation to fly in the opposite direction once he had rewound time. If it's a 'visual representation', there is nothing special about Superman flying in one direction around the Earth to allow him to go forward in time vs back in time, yet it syncs perfectly with the movement of the Earth (the visual representation).

This makes no sense, unless Superman knew an audience was watching and wanted to sync his spinning with the Earth's visual representation for some reason. </TEXT>
