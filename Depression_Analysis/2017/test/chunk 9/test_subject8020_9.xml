	<TEXT> Yeah as others have said, it's a huge pain in the ass to reunite dog and handler like in this case. I think I watched a documentary a while back where a former EOD soldier had an IED go off near him which paralyzed him from the waist down. His dog survived and it took them about 5 years as well to get the dog back to him. He described the situation to be extremely frustrating and that it was unbelievable how many loops you have to jump through and paperwork you have to fill out to get a service dog once they 'retire'. Eventually it happened and the feels man...the feels. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  The above-linked video has been circulating since 2009 and is variously reported as an audition for the television showArmenia's Got Talent,Poland's Got Talent, orRussia's Got Talentgone horribly wrong, a haplessly comedic "William Tell" act that ends with one participant taking an arrow straight through the head. No program by any of those names exists, however, and the set shown in the video curiously features only generic signs and props reading"Talent" in English  no fuller program name is displayed, no signage bearing anything written in the language of the country in which this program supposedly aired is evident, and no one in the clip speaks a word of dialogue.

The video can be pegged as fake for a number of reasons, chief among them that if such a horrible accident had truly occurred during the recording of a television show, it would not have been broadcast, and so we'd expect to be viewing the action "raw" as captured by a single camera. Yet the clip has obviously been cleanly edited (to include cuts to the judges' reactions) and has been subject to post-production (to add graphic overlays), simulating the appearance of something that was prepared or aired as part of a finished program. (Notto mention that the bowman fails to evince the least bit of horror or surprise at having "accidentally" shot his partner in the head.)

Some have speculated that this clip was a viral promotion for theCULT Colaenergy drink, a can of which the "victim" ostentatiously takes from one of the judges and places atop his head (with the label properly facing the camera) after failing at multiple efforts to balance an apple on his noggin. However, most likely it was merely intended as a spoof of the modern talent show genre.
