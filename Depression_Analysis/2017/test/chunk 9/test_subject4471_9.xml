	<TEXT> This isn't for me, but for my brother. He was born with [sotos syndrome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sotos_syndrome); a defect in one of his proteins at birth caused over-growth, but delayed intelligence. He is 16 right now but acts more like a 10-11 year old.

Me and my brother, the older siblings, are okay - no disabilities or anything. We're both on-off wrestling fans, but our little brother has been a fan for years. One of his favourites is Bret Hart and I am sure it would make the year to him to meet Bret in person (he's only been to a house show; big John Cena and Big Show fan). </TEXT>
