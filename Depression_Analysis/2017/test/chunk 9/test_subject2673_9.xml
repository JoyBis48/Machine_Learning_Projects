	<TEXT> A few of my closest friends know I use occasionally and if I'm high they'll usually ask what I'm on and I'll tell them H or oxy. If someone else asks I'll just say I haven't had coffee and I'm tired. I shudder when I try to imagine the fallout that would occur if my parents or any of my extended family found out. But that's the nature of these drugs, you have to be able to keep secrets from certain people. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I snorted some adderall, had a few shots of vodka, smoked a blunt and couldn't get it up. Needless to say she was disappointed, but she was also fucked up on vicodin and alcohol so she didn't care too much. We cuddled and watched some Netflix, I took an ativan to fall asleep and that was the night. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was told that these were fake 80s by my dealer but that they did contain a moderate amount of some opiate. When i snort half a pill there's not much euphoria but there is a very heavy nod. The nod doesn't last as long as dope. Maybe it's fentanyl but I don't consider myself experienced enough to say with any certainty. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The analysis of antinociceptive efficacies produced by co-administration of ascorbic acid and morphine or tramadol for different levels of nociception, revealed that co-administration provided better antinociceptive coverage than the individual drugs. There is neither a simple explanation for the mechanism of interaction between the two drugs, nor for the type of interaction at different levels of the antinociceptive effect.  
  
Very interesting. It's unfortunate that the mechanism behind this interaction isn't well understood yet. Something I'm curious about is how Table 2 lists the dosage ratio of morphine to ascorbic acid as about 1:260 and how this would translate to actual dosage in humans. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Actually it depends. If the drug you're snorting has better oral bioavailability than intranasal then a drip is actually desirable and may slightly increase absorption, i.e. oxycodone. But with other drugs like ketamine for example, a drip is less desirable because of how bad oral bioavailability is. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Coke + Oxycodone - Thoughts? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Hi :)  
  
Currently pretty high on this combo and I love it. I find that the oxy takes the edge off some of the uncomfortable twitchiness from coke.  
  
But I also have a question. I'm aware that cocaine is cardiotoxic, but would adding an opiate such as oxycodone to the mix put more "strain" on the heart, making the combination even worse for your heart?  
  
I'd also like to hear what people think about mixing coke with other opiates. Are there any that you prefer mixing coke with? Thank you all, I lurk a lot and don't post too often but I really like this community. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 1. I had tried quite a few drugs (but not nearly as many as some people on here) before trying opiates. One day I was finally able to get my hands on some 5/325 vicodins. Took 2, smoked some weed and had a great time.  
  
2. The high has a physical aspect to it that just isn't there with weed. No matter how high you get on weed you won't experience the same extent of analgesia you get from opiates. Or the "not giving a fuck" type feeling because of how absolutely amazing you feel from the euphoria.  
  
3. I only use occasionally so that my tolerance stays low and so I can avoid addiction.  
  
4. I would say they've had a negative effect on my social life. I've had to hide my use from most of my friends. It really depends on the person but the guilt from hiding it from certain people can get to you after a while. As for the positive aspect, getting high on opiates is better than every other drug I've tried.  
  
5. I've never binged on opiates since I try very hard to space out my usage.  
  
6. Know that physical withdrawals are the least of your worries compared to the social stigma, monetary cost, tolerance, psychological addiction and even death if you shoot up. </TEXT>
