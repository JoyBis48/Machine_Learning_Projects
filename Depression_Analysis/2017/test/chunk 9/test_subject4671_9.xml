	<TEXT> you should post an OH squat form check. You don't have to pull the bar too far back on an OH squat. I struggled with my OH Squat for a long time until i figured i was pulling it back too far which put unnecessary pressure on my joints.

	<TEXT> knees out is a que i use to make sure i'm opening my hips. It's exactly what it sounds like, as you send your hips back focus on your knees going out. [This picture](http://www.precisionnutrition.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/what-your-knees-should-not-be-doing-during-a-squat1.png) shows you what i mean..make sure your legs are like A.

As for the row..you can keep your grip wide if you have mobility issues..however think about pulling your elbows to the back of the room. It might have been the camera angle but it looked like you were doing a bent over high pull instead of a row </TEXT>

	<TEXT> squats: you are doing low bar so focus on sending your hips back hard and opening up your hips by driving your knees out. dont look down and i think that will fix your back rounding

bench press: hard to tell without a perpedicular vantage point but it seems you dont have a straight bar path. Looks like you are pushing towards your head a little bit(you almost hit the rack)

row: looks like your elbows aren't going back towards the wall but rather sideways during the lift. this would cue some shoulder pain. your end point should look more like [this](http://www.fitbie.com/sites/default/files/barbell-row-b-ex.jpg) </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Coming from Crossfit to ICF..quick question regarding starting weights. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-12-22 21:24:36 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi all,

I have been doing crossfit for the past year and a half..for the last year I did a strength focus class that swapped between 3 month segments of WSSB style programming(1 heavy leg, 1 dynamic upper, rest, 1 dynamic lower, 1 heavy upper) and 3 months of oly lifting cycles. In that time my numbers went to:

Squat: 235 1RM

Front Squat: 185 1RM

Deadlift: 335 1RM

Press: 125 1RM

Clean   Jerk: 175 1RM

Bench: 145 1RM ( :( Sad Panda)

on the ICF 5 x 5 video he says to start at 75% of your 1RM for 5x5.should i still start at that weight even if I've been lifting for a longer period of time than a true novice? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks! If you don't mind I have an objective question ... coming from LoL I know a dragon is worth a tower take down and that both those are equal to 2-3 deaths. I know 1 kill is worth 15-20 minion kills. Is there an equivalent in dota2? With this in mind I value midas BC I feel I can play safe enough to not die needlessly and use the midas to accelerate my farm which will accelerate my items . Im guessing that my assumption that tradeoff is "worth" may be incorrect  </TEXT>

I find that i'm comfortable with late game right click carries...and not 100% terrible with spell casters. Right now I'm working my way through the all hero challenge to get an idea of what every character can do.

here is a link to a recent game i had on slarder [link](http://www.dotabuff.com/matches/1082870278). If i remember correctly i felt like we were ahead in this game and then something happened where i went from carrying to weak...i think i made a bad item choice in buying bkb but i'm not sure

I had a history of playing LoL so don't be afraid to offer all levels of criticism </TEXT>

also it looks like you are getting forward on your toes..focus on sending your hips back while pushing the knees out to open up the hips as you go down. this will also help you achieve better depth </TEXT>

	<TEXT> imo the Games' scoring doesn't reward the consistent guys (the guys who are finishing 10-20th every event) the way it does the top scorers. A terrible finish in a Games workout is nowhere near as crippling as it is at regionals, so long as you take top 3 on a few workouts. It rewards the top athletes, makes a terrible finish less significant, and kind of shafts the consistent middle of the pack athletes. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> because this way i gather enjoyment from both

edit: to clarify. if i watch the show first, the book becomes supplemental material that i still enjoy..where as reading the books would probably make me despise the show. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> what is your definition of "dive in"? should do multiple sessions per a day 5 days a week? probably not. First thing you should do is find a box near you that provides an onramp program(aka a training program), this will introduce you to crossfit movements at a lower level of intensity with more focus on form(the one at my gym last 6 sessions effectively 2 weeks)

Then start with 3 days a week and see how you feel. My first month the only thing i lifted during WODs was the 15 lb training bar to get my form down..now i'm 7 months in and I did 55 reps of deadlifts at 155lb today. </TEXT>
