	<TEXT> My laptop says it's connected and some sites (like reddit) are loading, but almost all of them just load for a minute and then time out. I just did all the driver updates my computer said it had, restarting, scanning for malware, and checking my most recent installations, and I can't really think of anything else to look for. This on my school's Internet and I checked my friends computer and it loaded everything just fine, so I don't think it's a problem with the school. I'm using windows 7, Intel i7-4810. If you need to know anything else, just ask. Thanks for any help.

Edit: I forgot to mention that my computer says my connection is fine and a speed test says I am getting 15 Mbps. </TEXT>
