	<TEXT> **Just piggybacking this top comment so this gets seen**  

Here are some witness accounts of what actually happened .

 It happened near to me. Spurs youth lit it and threw sideways into row s. The 47 year old guy arrested was in a suit and wore glasses. The smoke bomb fell at his feet. It was horrible, my 13 year old was gagging as was everybody in the vicinity and it stung the eyes. The guy in the suit picked it up and threw it out of the way much to the relief of all those around him. After that further down someone else would have done the same to get it clear of them. They would not have been able to see where they had thrown it. IMHO neither of them should be charged or banned. They had to clear it from where they were. It was very sad that it hit the linesman but it wasn't a hooligan issue it was a safety issue. We were searched going into the ground so I have no idea how those who took it in managed to get the smoke bomb in. 

another:

 The fella who threw it on the pitch (and unfortunately hit the linesman) is a mate of mine. It originated from the Spurs fans in the upper tier and landed in the lower tier. My mate tried to lob it underarm on to the side of the pitch because the people around him were struggling to see / breathe. Unfortunately he mis-judged it a bit and hit the lino, just an unfortunate accident. Plod and the Villa stewards had a word with him and to be fair the stewards were really good, they realised what he was trying to do and told the old bill not to nick him. He was back in for the 2nd half so presumably the two they have nicked are the ones from the upper tier who threw it in the first place
