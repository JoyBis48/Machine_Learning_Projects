	<TEXT> It got rid of a lot of beloved characters/history, and allowed patchy writers free reign to rewrite the histories of beloved characters. Batman didn't actually have it too bad, other than the loss of the previous batgirls and said Mr Freeze retcon (although Mr Freeze still has about 20 years of stories with his old origin, so one can argue all that can be said was said) but other characters, like the Teen Titans, got hit pretty hard by the reboot. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's a similar problem with a lot of batman villains. Because the majority aren't evil, but mentally ill, you can only go so many stories before the audience sympathy goes away or your forced to redeem them in some way, which may be why recent books lean towards either new villains or unrepentant murderers (Talia, Joker) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Basically, companies force journalists to stick to review embargoes, in return for giving these journalists resources/interviews/free tickets/ flights to sets and the like. This is so they can allow the reviews to coincide with marketing and release of the film. Since the early screenings of Fury Road were a week ago, I'm guessing the embargo is to carry the momentum to the final screening, rather than have it be 'old news'. </TEXT>

I wouldn't know how 'difficult' the moon presence is compared to Gerhman, because I beat them both first time, so, for me at least the point still stands (You also wouldn't be able to beat either of them at level 1 as easily as CB) </TEXT>

If we're throwing really off the wall theories up, may I suggest that The wet nurse is actually Velka from Dark souls? She's implied to be more omnipotent than the other Gods in that game, has a strong association with crows, and Marvelous Chester is implied to come from a victorian setting, which implies that Yarnham may be Carim from DS, a land that Velka is strongly implied to be associated with.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The Cainhurst Cathedral hunter has killed me more time than any boss, I tried every combo of weapons, every paper, every cheesy tactic.... and I ended up killing eileen because I was trying to hit him with the whip through the door, I tried to quickly reload, but nope, he's back to full health and Eileen is still dead. 


So I decided, I was going to **destroy** this guy, I complete the entire rest of the game using Eileen set, I realize I'm easily kicking Gerhmans ass, so I prepare to face this guy one final time, avenging Eileens death...

And he kills me, again and again. Finally, I try to cheese him with the same door technique, but I have to take a phonecall. I get back to the game and... something weird is happening, he seems to be taking damage from his start point. It turns out he has his chikage stuck in 2 hand mode, and the AI didn't know to put it back. I watched him die, both robbed of my revenge, and the Eileen quest.

People say the moon presence is the final boss... Not for me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, it's one thing to have an opinion, it's another to be flat out wrong.


If you're saying that they DON'T look exactly alike, how I am I 'flat out wrong' in saying that Bane doesn't look like comic-Bane in batman and Robin? Why are you going *out of your way* to give Batman and Robin objective credit that it doesn't deserve? It's such a childlike mentality to assume that the other person is


categorically incorrect

	<TEXT> Indie games also don't need to be Ps4 exclusive, or have advanced graphics and lighting. Acting like 30fps is unmanageable is pretty elitist, and it's extremely unfair to compare bloodborne to mgsV </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Because MGSV has a budget of hundreds of millions of dollars, has hundreds of team members, and a custom built engine designed to scale to everything. Bloodborne is made by way fewer people, and they likely decided to focus on the graphics, and things like the multiplayer component, rather than the framerate. It's not like 60FPS was actually working properly in that time, it was likely dropping down way too much to be playable. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Helikite's drake's fire doesn't factor fire resistance in, hence why it kills people in full fire res gear. Whilst in a 'story' the drake would easily be beat, because it's a derivative of an actual dragon, in the actual game logic, the drake would have much more of a chance. </TEXT>

Particularly as he KNOWS that when he replies, his followers will attack and harass that person. (see also, Brianna Wu Matt Lees and those charity streamers, ) he also said [videogames should be apolitical] (https://twitter.com/Totalbiscuit/status/578685278342287360) something that is, in my opinion, extremely regressive, and he decided to get annoyed at Jim Sterling for [posting a trans awareness page.](https://archive.today/KTGv3) Simon has a right to criticize TB, particularly as TB's tweet in question called a random artist a 'moron' for daring to make a pop culture reference. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah. She was introduced in Suicide Squad, then got introduced properly to the family. The only time she was actually Batgirl was a carryover from the 66' TV series, and she wasn't that relevant back then. Which is why it was kinda weird she became the new Batgirl, despite the prestige, she never really WAS that character. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> To provide further context, at the time, the story was seen as outside of continuity, as it's heavily implied to be a silver age batman story (Batgirl was only around in the silver age, there hasn't actually been a 'modern' batgirl till nu52) so Moore was given free reign to do whatever he wanted. It would be a few years before Barbara came back as a disable character, in the pages of suicide squad. </TEXT>
