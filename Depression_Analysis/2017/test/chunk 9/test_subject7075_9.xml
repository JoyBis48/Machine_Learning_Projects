	<TEXT> I used to smoke almost daily, but only a joint a day. I stopped for a little for finals week and school and began experiencing insomnia. I'm not sure if this was because I stopped smoking or I was stressed because of finals. Either way: everything in moderation.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I get mad at that, too. I also get upset when people hold the bong/joint/blunt/bowl/etc and don't pass it. It bothers me when I'm passed a roll and there's 6 inches of ash hanging off and then it lands on me or in my car. It's annoying smoking with paranoid people because then I get paranoid. I also dislike when people don't know they're limits and then you're forced to babysit someone who is having a panic attack.

	<TEXT> Necessity. 
I'm a college student and worked as an RA for a year (shh don't tell my supervisor) and had little money left over after purchasing my little supply. I also didn't want to be going around with a piece and obviously couldn't smoke indoors. I opted to going with the blunt/joint route. It's cheap, simple, and when you finish your sesh you don't have any incriminating paraphernalia on your person. Albeit rolling is much harder than packing a bowl, but I learned to roll well in only a little while. I suggest starting out with blunts or wraps as I feel they are easier to roll than papers - but it's certainly a personal preference. 

Definitely a good stoner-skill to know! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The first couple times I smoked nothing happened; it became frustrating for me. I wanted to know what being high was like. I then started to get high and understood what it was like. 

Just be careful when you first start out. You may see that people smoke more than you. Don't worry, that's okay; it isn't a contest. Being *too* high is a thing and it isn't good if you're first starting out. I also suggest doing it somewhere safe around good company (or alone. There's nothing wrong with smoking alone). Just enjoy yourself. Welcome to the community and happy toking!
