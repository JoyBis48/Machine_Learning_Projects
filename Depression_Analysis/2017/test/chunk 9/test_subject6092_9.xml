	<TEXT> So I loved the movie. One of my first impressions about 5 minutes in is oh that's Judy Greer. I like her! And then oh no horrible acting and fairly cheesy so far. And then it got nostalgic. And then it got somewhat funny and then we were being introduced to characters. Then it got tense and that tension turned into bad-assery. I would recommend it. Perfect movie theatre movie. I'll probably go see it in a theatre again. Worth it. Just don't expect it to be written well. If you go into a jurassic park movie expecting brilliant writing you clearly didn't look at the poster. The seller of this movie is the thrill, Chris Pratt being hunky and the magic felt from the original.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So I have two semesters left in a two year university and I'll be applying to transfer to four year universities come fall. I went into this two year university with my eye on epidemiology, but I kept my heart and my eyes open. I've bounced around from thinking about French, history and psychology. I have my eyes and heart set on epidemiology now. I'll be graduating from this two year school with a liberal arts degree, and then I plan on getting my bachelors in something else. I'm thinking biological sciences, but is there another major that would be better preparation?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So soon I'll be coming onto a decent amount of money, and I will be looking to invest at most $2,500 of it for now. 
I'm 21 years old, in college and I work part time making roughly $360 every 2 weeks. Right now I make it paycheck to paycheck, but once this money comes in (probably in the next 3 months) I will have a good safety net from it. 
I just want to turn this money into more money so I can pay some of my student loans off quicker.
I want that money to be safe though. 
I don't have any holdings aside from a 401k with about $2000 in it. (is that a holding?) 
No big debts yet, but I'll have some once I transfer to a 4 year school.
No house, no car, girlfriend is fairly needy though.
Thank you.
Also, I really have no clue what to do with this, but I'm a quick learner so if I could get any tips on books I could read to become a better investor that wold be really appreciated. Thanks again.

	<TITLE> PC for School use and Gaming for about $1500 </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-05-06 19:57:24 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> **What will you be doing with this PC? Be as specific as possible, and include specific games or programs you will be using.**

I will be using the laptop for school and gaming, as well as listening to a lot of music and watching a lot of movies and tv shows. I like to use Microsoft word and all that jazz. For games I will typically be playing GTA, FIFA, Cities Skylines and some various sport simulation games. 

**What is your maximum budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?** 

My maximum budget would be nothing higher than $1600.


**When do you plan on building/buying the PC? Note: beyond a week or two from today means any build you receive will be out of date when you want to buy.** 

Probably won't be buying for about a month or so... I hope that doesn't actually matter. I don't mind if it's out of date, I'm just looking for an idea of what I need. 

**What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? (Tower/OS/monitor/keyboard/mouse/etc)** 

Everything, tower, os, monitor, keyboard, mouse, controller, etc I'm not too sure

**Which country (and state/province) will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in US, do you have access to a Microcenter location?** 

Connecticut, USA

**If reusing any parts (including monitor(s)/keyboard/mouse/etc), what parts will you be reusing? Brands and models are appreciated.** 

Not reusing anything

**Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?** 

No overclocking

**Are there any specific features or items you want/need in the build? (ex: SSD, large amount of storage or a RAID setup, CUDA or OpenCL support, etc)**

I would like a large amount of storage

**Do you have any specific case preferences (Size like ITX/microATX/mid-tower/full-tower, styles, colors, window or not, LED lighting, etc), or a particular color theme preference for the components?**

Don't know

**Do you need a copy of Windows 7 or 8.1 included in the budget? If you do need one included, do you have a preference for one or the other?**
I would like a copy of windows 7 included in the budget.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I watched the Manny and Floyd match, and I actually really enjoyed it. It seemed clear to me that Mayweather won because he dictated the pace every round except for two or three and when he was on the offensive it seemed well planned and much more impactful than Pac's offense. So after the fight I browse Facebook and a lot of people are saying it's bullshit that Pac lost and it's embarrassing how Mayweather ran around all fight. Before watching I did my research and expected Mayweather to win, and quite frankly I thought it would t be too close, and it really wasn't that close in my eyes. 
So when I check this subreddit out a couple days after the hype I notice that no one is really complaining about the fight and I figure that's because the people that go on here now actually know boxing.
I think Boxing might slide into competition for my 4th or 3rd favorite sport, behind baseball and soccer.

Also I have a question, was Ali more of a tactician (like people say Floyd is)? That's what my friend who is a small boxing fan said.  </TEXT>

They're not talking about anything interesting, when they talk it's absolutely one sided conversation or they're repeating stuff (West Virginians). It's terrible, I don't know if it's because I'm older now or if Kruk, Schilling and Shulman are terrible. They seem to jump to conclusions, make terrible attempts at jokes, repeat themselves and circle jerk.    </TEXT>
