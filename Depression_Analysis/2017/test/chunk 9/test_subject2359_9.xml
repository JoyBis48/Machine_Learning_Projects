	<TEXT>  But for Texas and Virginia it was about nationalism.

What a load of complete horseshit.  Here's the declaration of secession of the state of Texas, which mentions the abolition of slavery about fifty times as the primary point of grievance:


 Texas abandoned her separate national existence and consented to become one of the Confederated Union to promote her welfare, insure domestic tranquility and secure more substantially the blessings of peace and liberty to her people. She was received into the confederacy with her own constitution, under the guarantee of the federal constitution and the compact of annexation, that she should enjoy these blessings. She was received as a commonwealth holding, maintaining and protecting the institution known as negro slavery-- the servitude of the African to the white race within her limits-- a relation that had existed from the first settlement of her wilderness by the white race, and which her people intended should exist in all future time. Her institutions and geographical position established the strongest ties between her and other slave-holding States of the confederacy. Those ties have been strengthened by association. But what has been the course of the government of the United States, and of the people and authorities of the non-slave-holding States, since our connection with them? 
 
 The controlling majority of the Federal Government, under various pretences and disguises, has so administered the same as to exclude the citizens of the Southern States, unless under odious and unconstitutional restrictions, from all the immense territory owned in common by all the States on the Pacific Ocean, for the avowed purpose of acquiring sufficient power in the common government to use it as a means of destroying the institutions of Texas and her sister slaveholding States. 
 
 By the disloyalty of the Northern States and their citizens and the imbecility of the Federal Government, infamous combinations of incendiaries and outlaws have been permitted in those States and the common territory of Kansas to trample upon the federal laws, to war upon the lives and property of Southern citizens in that territory, and finally, by violence and mob law, to usurp the possession of the same as exclusively the property of the Northern States. 
 
 The Federal Government, while but partially under the control of these our unnatural and sectional enemies, has for years almost entirely failed to protect the lives and property of the people of Texas against the Indian savages on our border, and more recently against the murderous forays of banditti from the neighboring territory of Mexico; and when our State government has expended large amounts for such purpose, the Federal Government has refuse reimbursement therefor, thus rendering our condition more insecure and harassing than it was during the existence of the Republic of Texas. 
 
 These and other wrongs we have patiently borne in the vain hope that a returning sense of justice and humanity would induce a different course of administration. 
 
 When we advert to the course of individual non-slave-holding States, and that a majority of their citizens, our grievances assume far greater magnitude. 
 
 The States of Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Wisconsin, Michigan and Iowa, by solemn legislative enactments, have deliberately, directly or indirectly violated the 3rd clause of the 2nd section of the 4th article [the fugitive slave clause] of the federal constitution, and laws passed in pursuance thereof; thereby annulling a material provision of the compact, designed by its framers to perpetuate the amity between the members of the confederacy and to secure the rights of the slave-holding States in their domestic institutions-- a provision founded in justice and wisdom, and without the enforcement of which the compact fails to accomplish the object of its creation. Some of those States have imposed high fines and degrading penalties upon any of their citizens or officers who may carry out in good faith that provision of the compact, or the federal laws enacted in accordance therewith. 
 
 In all the non-slave-holding States, in violation of that good faith and comity which should exist between entirely distinct nations, the people have formed themselves into a great sectional party, now strong enough in numbers to control the affairs of each of those States, based upon an unnatural feeling of hostility to these Southern States and their beneficent and patriarchal system of African slavery, proclaiming the debasing doctrine of equality of all men, irrespective of race or color-- a doctrine at war with nature, in opposition to the experience of mankind, and in violation of the plainest revelations of Divine Law. They demand the abolition of negro slavery throughout the confederacy, the recognition of political equality between the white and negro races, and avow their determination to press on their crusade against us, so long as a negro slave remains in these States. 
 
 For years past this abolition organization has been actively sowing the seeds of discord through the Union, and has rendered the federal congress the arena for spreading firebrands and hatred between the slave-holding and non-slave-holding States. 
 
 By consolidating their strength, they have placed the slave-holding States in a hopeless minority in the federal congress, and rendered representation of no avail in protecting Southern rights against their exactions and encroachments. They have proclaimed, and at the ballot box sustained, the revolutionary doctrine that there is a 'higher law' than the constitution and laws of our Federal Union, and virtually that they will disregard their oaths and trample upon our rights. 
 
 They have for years past encouraged and sustained lawless organizations to steal our slaves and prevent their recapture, and have repeatedly murdered Southern citizens while lawfully seeking their rendition. 
 
 They have invaded Southern soil and murdered unoffending citizens, and through the press their leading men and a fanatical pulpit have bestowed praise upon the actors and assassins in these crimes, while the governors of several of their States have refused to deliver parties implicated and indicted for participation in such offenses, upon the legal demands of the States aggrieved. 
 
 They have, through the mails and hired emissaries, sent seditious pamphlets and papers among us to stir up servile insurrection and bring blood and carnage to our firesides. 
 
 They have sent hired emissaries among us to burn our towns and distribute arms and poison to our slaves for the same purpose. 
 
 They have impoverished the slave-holding States by unequal and partial legislation, thereby enriching themselves by draining our substance. 
 
 They have refused to vote appropriations for protecting Texas against ruthless savages, for the sole reason that she is a slave-holding State. 
 
 And, finally, by the combined sectional vote of the seventeen non-slave-holding States, they have elected as president and vice-president of the whole confederacy two men whose chief claims to such high positions are their approval of these long continued wrongs, and their pledges to continue them to the final consummation of these schemes for the ruin of the slave-holding States. 
 
 In view of these and many other facts, it is meet that our own views should be distinctly proclaimed. 
 
 We hold as undeniable truths that the governments of the various States, and of the confederacy itself, were established exclusively by the white race, for themselves and their posterity; that the African race had no agency in their establishment; that they were rightfully held and regarded as an inferior and dependent race, and in that condition only could their existence in this country be rendered beneficial or tolerable. 
 
 That in this free government *all white men are and of right ought to be entitled to equal civil and political rights* [emphasis in the original]; that the servitude of the African race, as existing in these States, is mutually beneficial to both bond and free, and is abundantly authorized and justified by the experience of mankind, and the revealed will of the Almighty Creator, as recognized by all Christian nations; while the destruction of the existing relations between the two races, as advocated by our sectional enemies, would bring inevitable calamities upon both and desolation upon the fifteen slave-holding states. 
 
 By the secession of six of the slave-holding States, and the certainty that others will speedily do likewise, Texas has no alternative but to remain in an isolated connection with the North, or unite her destinies with the South. 
 
 For these and other reasons, solemnly asserting that the federal constitution has been violated and virtually abrogated by the several States named, seeing that the federal government is now passing under the control of our enemies to be diverted from the exalted objects of its creation to those of oppression and wrong, and realizing that our own State can no longer look for protection, but to God and her own sons-- We the delegates of the people of Texas, in Convention assembled, have passed an ordinance dissolving all political connection with the government of the United States of America and the people thereof and confidently appeal to the intelligence and patriotism of the freemen of Texas to ratify the same at the ballot box, on the 23rd day of the present month. 
 
 Adopted in Convention on the 2nd day of Feby, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty-one and of the independence of Texas the twenty-fifth.

Your slavery-apologia revisionism is a disgrace to America. </TEXT>

You have also woefully misreported the 10th amendment.

Well, I guess either both I and 230 years of Supreme Court decisions are wrong, or someone who can't handle basic logic is wrong.  I mean, the Tenth Amendment relies upon assuming states being part of the existing federal framework.  What's so fucking hard to understand about that? </TEXT>

Because there's no mechanism for doing so.  It's a binding contract with no escape clause.

It actually specifically LIMITS federal power. It puts states rights OUTSIDE of federal jurisdiction.

Uh, yes.  But that federal jurisdiction is explicitly stated to exist in the first place.  The Tenth Amendment empirically acknowledges that states are a part of a larger federal framework.  Your argument undermines itself. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  What was the point of the Panion Domin (his manipulation?)

The Pannion Seer was a creature of pure pain, and he wanted to spread pain and suffering for its own sake.

 What was the point of Ruthald and his Cursed Sword?

We don't particularly know, but it doesn't seem relevant.

 Who were the Strangers (the Jade things in the Sky)

The souls of the Crippled God's people, coming to find him and drag him back to their world.

 What happened on the Moon?

Some of the Jade Giants ran into it, destroying it.

 Why did the other gods destroy the Fallen God?

Why not?  They had their spheres of influence, and he was encroaching.

 Why did the fallen god and the other gods become friends?

An alliance of mutual interest - he wanted to leave, and they wanted him gone.

 What did the Fallen God do to the Otataral Dragon?

Nothing - that was Heboric, re-chaining the Otataral Dragon.

 Why did the Fallen God get stabbed in the back by Cotollion?

Presumably because he couldn't leave in his corporeal form, and had to be freed from a physical body.

 Who was trying to kill the Bridgburners? Tayschern turned out to be innocent.

The politics are muddled, but it wasn't so much the Bridgeburners as Whiskeyjack, whom the Empress viewed as a rival power.  Tayschrenn just wasn't good at court politics.

 Why were Mallic Rel   friend get spared and become emperor?

Mallick Rel had corrupted the Claw, and his version of the Fall at Aren prevailed, making him out to be the hero.  Laseen couldn't compete with his influence.

These are just the questions off the top of my head, the author never explains anything and now he is selling more books? its just signs of a poor writer.

It's all explained pretty clearly.  It's more a sign of poor reading comprehension. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not sure if "heart-wrenching" is the right word, but I've always loved this bittersweet quote from "Toll the Hounds" by Steven Erikson:


He hurried on, grimacing at the ache in his chest, still feeling the parting kiss of his wife on his lips, the careless hugs of his children round his waist.

He was a man who would never ask for sympathy.  He was a man who sought only to do what was right.  Such people appear in the world, every world, now and then, like a single refrain of some blessed song, a fragment caught on the spur of an otherwise raging cacophony.

Imagine a world without such souls.

Yes, is should have been harder to do. </TEXT>

The name had already stuck, and was already in very widespread use as shorthand for the ACA, before the White House started using it as a positive.  The very article you linked to points that out. </TEXT>
