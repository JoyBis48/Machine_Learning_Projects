	<TEXT> The White Tree is the symbol for Gondor, and represents Aragorn's hereditary right to the throne of Gondor. With the slow disintegration and eventual disappearance of Aragorn's family line from the throne of Gondor, the "Tree in the Court of the Fountain" withers and dies. So the White Tree of Minas Tirith is clearly connected to the health of Gondor's kings, and to the wellbeing of the kingdom in general. When Gondor loses its king and comes under the power of the line of Stewards, the White Tree dies out.

When the Black Gate first falls and the Eagle comes flying to Gondor to spread the news, the proof the Eagle offers that things are going to get better is that the White Tree will come back to life:

*And the Tree that was withered shall be renewed,*

*and he shall plant it in the high places,*

*and the City shall be blessed.*

When Aragorn comes back to Minas Tirith, Gandalf leads him to the mountain behind the city. There, Aragorn finds a little baby White Tree: "Lo! here is the scion of the Eldest of Trees!". And Aragorn replants this tree in the Court of the Fountain. Its health and rapid blooming proves Aragorn's claim. 

But the White Tree doesn't just symbolize Aragorn's family or the health of Gondor in general. It also represents the link between the Men of Nmenor from whom the people of Gondor are descended and the origins of Middle-earth in the lands of the Utter West and the Blessed Realm of the Valar. That's a fancy, Tolkienesque way of saying that this tree is a symbol of Gondor's roots, which are long and, well, pretty powerful.

This tree that Aragorn finds on Mount Mindolluin, Gandalf traces its descent line: "Verily this is a sapling of the line of Nimloth the fair; and that was a seedling of Galathilion, and that a fruit of Telperion of many names, Eldest Trees."

The return of the White Tree to Minas Tirith proves that Aragorn has restored Gondor's former glory as the home of the Men of Nmenor. Sauron, a servant of the original Great Enemy who destroyed the Two Trees in Valinor, has been driven permanently from Middle-earth. The replanting of the baby tree descended from those original Two Trees shows that we have come full circle: the powers who destroyed the Two Trees in the first place has been conquered and Good (represented by that new young tree) has won out in Middle-earth. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No, no special term for the lineage, and they were known simply as the First, Second, Third and Fourth White Tree of Gondor. Also, it's Silmarils. 

Because I can, here's the history..

Yavanna sang into existence the Two Trees, silver Telperion and golden Laurelin shedding light comparable to moon and sun. Telperion was referred to as male and Laurelin female. The Trees sat on the hill Ezellohar located outside Valimar. They grew in the presence of all of the Valar, watered by the tears of Nienna. Because the Elves that first came to Valinor especially loved Telperion, Yavanna made a second tree like it to stand in the city of Tirion where the Vanyar and Noldor dwelt together at first. This tree, named Galathilion, was identical to Telperion except that it gave no light of its own being. It had many seedlings, one of which was named Celeborn, and planted on the isle of Tol Eressa.

In the Second Age, a seedling of Celeborn was brought as a gift to the Nmenreans, that was known as Nimloth, the White Tree of Nmenor. It lasted through the vast majority of the realm's duration, but when Sauron took control of the island he had king Ar-Pharazn chop it down.

The first White Tree of Gondor came from a fruit that Isildur, at great personal risk, managed to steal from Nimloth the Fair, the White Tree of Nmenor, before it was destroyed at Sauron's insistence. He suffered many wounds at this mission, and he came near death, but when the first leaf opened in the spring, Isildur was healed of his wounds.

This sapling was brought to Middle-earth on Isildur's ship, and it was eventually planted in Minas Ithil before the house of Isildur. But when Sauron returned to Middle-earth, he launched a sudden attack that captured Minas Ithil, and he destroyed the White Tree.

Isildur escaped the capture of Minas Ithil, taking with him a sapling of the White Tree to Minas Anor where it was planted in the citadel courtyard in memory of his slain brother Anrion. This tree died in 1636 during the Great Plague.

A third sapling was planted in the year 1640 of the Third Age by King Tarondor. This one lasted until the year 2872 and the death of the Ruling Steward Belecthor II.

At this time no seedling of the tree could be found as the tree had rarely flowered after the line of the Kings had failed and therefore no fruit was produced. It was left standing after its death "until the King returns".

When Aragorn became king he discovered (with Gandalf's help) a sapling of the White Tree upon the slopes of Mindolluin, high above the city, which he reverently planted in the Court of the Fountain. The dead tree was removed from the court but was placed in the Tombs of the Kings with all the honour that would normally be accorded a fallen monarch. In June of the year 3019 of the Third Age the sapling was already laden with blossom.

	<TEXT> It's noted that Telperion had white blossoms like a cherry, and that Laurelin had leaves like a beech - though generally it was also noted to have been 'founded' on the laburnum:

On the carbon copy of LQ 2, which otherwise received no emendations, my father added the following note to the word spilth in the last sentence: meant to indicate that Laurelin is 'founded' on the laburnum. 4 'jocund spilth of yellow fire' Francis Thompson  who no doubt got the word from Timon of Athens (his vocabulary was largely derived from Elizabethan English).

Anyone who is capable of getting themselves into a position of power should on no account be allowed to do the job. Another problem with governing people is people." ~ Douglas Adams </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Most similar to a beech tree. From *Unfinished Tales*:

Its bark was silver and smooth, and its boughs somewhat upswept after the manner of the beech; but it never grew save with a single trunk. Its leaves, like those of the beech but greater, were pale green above and beneath were silver, glistering in the sun; in the autumn they did not fall, but turned to pale gold. In the spring it bore golden blossom in clusters like a cherry, which bloomed on during the summer; and as soon as the flowers opened the leaves fell, so that through spring and summer a grove of malinorni was carpeted and roofed with gold, but its pillars were of grey silver. Its fruit was a nut with a silver shale. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> From Letter 340, from JRRT to Christopher:

"I never called Edith Luthien  but she was the source of the story that in time became the chief part of the Silmarillion. It was first conceived in a small woodland glade filled with hemlocks at Roos in Yorkshire (where I was for a brief time in command of an outpost of the Humber Garrison in 1917, and she was able to live with me for a while). In those days her hair was raven, her skin clear, her eyes brighter than you have seen them, and she could sing  and dance. But the story has gone crooked, and I am left, and I cannot plead before the inexorable Mandos." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I wouldn't've. I understand the indignation, but my inclination is that the privacy fears are slightly overblown. I dislike them, but they're largely benign, and they are what make the pretty amazing free services possible. You can lock down privacy controls to max strength these days, and choose your platforms and services to minimise intryusive practices. Check out /r/privacy, may help. Still..8 years of photos..? Hope you have a backup. Also, sorry but had to remove this post as we don't allow questions in /r/technology, else we'd get swamped by questions. It's in our rules.

	<TEXT> The chances that anyone has ever shuffled a pack of cards in the same way twice in the history of the world are infinitesimally small, statistically speaking. The number of possible permutations of 52 cards is 52 factorial otherwise known as 52! or 52 shriek. This is 52 times 51 times 50 . . . all the way down to one. Here's what that looks like: 
 80,658,175,170,943,878,571,660,636,856,403,766,
 975,289,505,440,883,277,824,000,000,000,000.

 To give you an idea of how many that is, here is how long it would take to go through every possible permutation of cards. If every star in our galaxy had a trillion planets, each with a trillion people living on them, and each of these people has a trillion packs of cards and somehow they manage to make unique shuffles 1,000 times per second, and they'd been doing that since the Big Bang, they'd only just now be starting to repeat shuffles.

Reports by the US Senate's committee on banking, housing and urban affairs -- which oversees American exports policy -- reveal that the US, under the successive administrations of Ronald Reagan and George Bush Snr, sold materials including anthrax, VX nerve gas, West Nile fever germs and botulism to Iraq right up until March 1992, as well as germs similar to tuberculosis and pneumonia. </TEXT>
