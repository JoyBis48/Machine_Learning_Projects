	<TEXT> Basically, trade hopes to relocates the pollution to developing countries that would otherwise be polluted in developed countries, so we have time to "specialize", so we can combat pollution in our country and export methods to other countries to combat pollution. Then, we hope that those countries grow + combat pollution. Afterwards, the pollution that would have been polluted in the developing country moves to another country.

	<TEXT> Ultra Rare Expressroids - This

Jetroid/Decoyroid/Gyroids maybe your best commons to pick up, since they are wind roid monsters, which matches the theme of speedroids.

Also, any generic anti-synchro cards or generic synchro support cards like tuners, synchrons, synchro monsters like Stardust Dragon, Plant synchros, synchro spells. synchro traps, etc because Konami will probably want the card game to coincide with the Arc-V storyline, where the characters are in the synchro dimension. 

The set won't be out until October, so you still have over the summer to pick up the stuff.

The same people, who claim that Fiscal Deficits do matter, yet there might be link between trade and fiscal deficits. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_deficit_hypothesis

"The twin deficits hypothesis, also called the double deficit hypothesis or twin deficits anomaly, is a macroeconomic proposition that there is a strong link between a national economy's current account balance and its government budget balance"

Of course, the national deficit has been dropping while we continue trade deficits at the moment.  </TEXT>

If 95% of scientists say that climate change is real, then economists must be right. Also, it is secret to ensure that we can get the best trade deal possible and don't lose. You know... Nobody loses in trade remember? (Comparative Advantage!) Also trade deficits don't matter because as long as consumers are happy with lower prices and we are exporting, then it is a win win situation. Cmon... Does anybody really want higher prices on goods and want a short run recession by blocking trade especially with the growing economies in the Pacific, which we already trade with? We will combat their growth with more trade with rules to hinder their growth, which they don't even know :D. Even Budget Deficits don't matter as long you invest in a country. You know... After World War 1, Germany had to export so many goods and consumer can't consumer as many goods with hyperinflation to repay its debt to the winners? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> True, but it is a good testing ground because countries operate as countries. You could then argue that since "most developing countries have mandated healthcare system in some sort of manner", then the USA shouldn't follow it because x, y, z....

	<TEXT> The USA engaged in trade, but was very protectionist until the Great Depression and World Wars throughout our industrial revolution. 

Our Free-Trade agreements has increased our trade deficits throughout many decades. Should we continue to have negative trade deficits? According to many, "trade deficits don't matter." supposedly. 

China has some protectionist tariffs on US made goods, while we have low tariffs on Chinese goods. I highly doubt any country such as India, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Thailand, etc have 0% tariffs on our goods. 

We subsidize our agriculture industry to the point that made Mexican agriculture nearly uncompetitive and caused many displaced workers to immigrate to America illegally. 

Outsourcing and Automation has played a major part in the deindustrialization of one industry cities in the Midwest. 

Overspecialization of certain economic sectors can be bad for any country, if something external happens.
Remember: Alberta's Recent Oil Troubles, since US stopped buying as much of Canadian oil? 

http://money.usnews.com/money/blogs/flowchart/2011/06/30/why-us-companies-arent-so-american-anymore

How is it that we are worried about China's economic growth, yet we already engage in Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China? We are concerned about and have been aiding their growth, yet somehow TPP will somehow curb China's power according to John Boehner, Obama, etc? 

How is TPP the most "progressive" trade deal for Obama, yet conservative enough for Republicans in Congress? If TPP will make trade in level terms, then there isn't as much of a comparative advantage incentive, so..... How does that actually work?
