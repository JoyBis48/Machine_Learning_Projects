	<TEXT> I for one think i'm not alone in saying that if the whole John Connor thing was kept under wraps until the movie, my jaw would've dropped at the reveal. It might have even brought the film up a peg or 2 (i didnt mind the movie anyway im just saying) - thoughts? (no hate) </TEXT>

	<TITLE> what characters/storylines would you want to see in Arkham Origins 2? (if they made it) </TITLE>

	<TEXT> I'd actually wouldn't mind a sequel to Origins. I think since there's 5 years between Origins and Asylum there's plenty of backstories and origins to explore in a Origins 2. Which ones would you like to see?

I'd love to see Dick Grayson become Robin and have him (possibly) as a recurring playable side character and allow dual play to return from Knight but it would be a main gameplay feature. I think that would be potentially awesome! 

What would you want to see? (no hate please - keep it friendly)  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I loved playing as Red Hood in the DLC for Arkham Knight. He was bad-ass and also killed people! If there was to be a whole game with him as the playable protagonist, i'd be down! Anyone else? </TEXT>
