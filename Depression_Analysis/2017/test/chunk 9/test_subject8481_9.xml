	<TITLE> Is it worth buying expensive lenses for an entry level DSLR? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> I bought a Canon T1i years ago when I was low on funds and was looking for something with better options than a basic point and shoot.  Now I'm looking to get some quality lenses, specifically the Canon EF 70-200mm f/4L USM http://goo.gl/9IWHkE, but I'm not sure if my entry level DSLR is going to make the most of it.

Has anyone experienced something similar?  If I need to upgrade my camera, how should I go about it? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's important to remember that bees are territorial and will attack other hives, killing the bees and stealing their honey if they are too close together.  Not everyone should have a bee hive, and in some regions you can go to a website to determine where the closest hive is to you.  It may not make sense to have one yourself. But for those people that have space for a hive, this looks interesting.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I had the exact opposite thought. A hard cookie would crack rather than be cut in a nice clean line.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you! I think that I might have actually unlocked webber by burying him in a grave or something like that.  I'm also at about 80 days in my current ROG game, so it shouldn't be long. 

I guess it's time to start adventure mode.   </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Not earning experience towards unlocking new characters. </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Typically you earn experience after you die that goes towards unlocking additional characters, but I seem to have stopped getting experience. 

I've played over 125 hours, some in ROG, but mostly in the originally game. At this point I have only unlocked the robot. I stopped getting XP a long time ago. 

Can someone tell me how I can started unlocking characters again? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My dad loves classic cars, and a '73 240z was the first car he ever bought with his own money. He bought another one in 2001 and let me drive it as much as I wanted. 

It's like your ass is on the ground. I shit you not, you literally feel like you're sitting on the road. I used to take my girlfriend for a ride, and that car was like an aphrodisiac. 

I wasn't alive when it was first  produced, but I'll always love that car.  </TEXT>
