	<TEXT> Everyone seems to disagree on the definition of plot holes and cameos. This sub also can't seem to make up their mind on Marvel movies. Any time these are mentioned, hilarious arguments ensue. What else?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Cracked did an article years ago about mismatched fights in action movies. Commando was mentioned. The writer described Bennett hysterically. Something to the effect of "he looks like the fat kid in the pool who doesn't take his shirt off" and "he's dressed like he's on the receiving end of bondage." Good shit.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This was fantastic! I could seriously hear the laugh track in my head at certain parts. After posting, I thought this may be trickier than Seinfeld as Frasier uses a lot of more.....cultured?....references, but you really tackled them here. I'd def be down to read more if you're inclined :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You'll have to forgive me, as I don't write for Seinfeld, but my understand is you can give a writing prompt- a situation each character is going through- and then let other redditors fill in the dialogue with what they believe will be said by the characters. Maybe something like  'Frasier accidentally ruins the ending of a movie on his show, prompting major backlash from his listeners and Roz herself.' Just an idea.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I love what Reddit does for Seinfeld, and with the amount of love this sub gets, I have to think that one of you could put together a scene. I don't possess that unique talent, but does anyone here want to give it a try?
Maybe to help get these started, I'll use a prompt I used in one of the comment below 
**After accidentally ruining the ending of a new movie on his radio show, Frasier faces major backlash from Seattle and Roz who really wanted to see it. Meanwhile Niles believes he is getting a dog allergy to Eddie**
Maybe something like that? </TEXT>
