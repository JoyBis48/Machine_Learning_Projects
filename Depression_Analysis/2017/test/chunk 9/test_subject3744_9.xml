	<TEXT> Did some searching because i have damaged some plastics with it before. I have used it in car audio for years to clean glue and stains from carpets. 

Found [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/chemistry/comments/1xurvh/ipad_cleaned_with_acetone/cfex21o) that explains which plastics are vulnerable to acetone. 

Acetone is great at dissolving common domestic polymers like polystyrene, polyethylene, PET etc, alcohols are pretty crappy at it. Acetone is also more likely to swell even specialized polymers

Also found [this on another forum](http://forums.reprap.org/read.php?70,84367,85439#msg-85439) that says it will dissolve acrylic which your counter top was most likely made of.

Hopefully someone that knows chemistry can explain why.

edit - because i accidently hit enter  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm normally not, but if you didn't start [being the prick first](https://www.reddit.com/r/rickandmorty/comments/3bk0he/episodes_1_and_2_are_leaked_from_season_2/csp73x0), I wouldn't have been an asshole. Maybe if you had any reading comprehension you would understand that my first comment was never saying anything about hulu. 

Yes your comment that i first replied to was about sitting through 30 second commercials was no big deal. My reply was stating that i have sat through so many commercials in my lifetime, i will do the most i can to avoid them completely. Had nothing to do with hulu.

You don't watch 18 minutes of ads on hulu, you watch 18 minutes of ads on cable. 

I never said anything about watching hulu.

Honestly, big deal. Perhaps many of you are younger, but if you told me 20 years ago that I could watch practically any show I wanted at my command for practically nothing ($8/month is nothing), and all I had to put up with was a few commercials, I'd have shit myself. It's not hard to put it on mute for 30 seconds. Seriously, there's worse things that could happen to you in life than having to endure a short ad.

You never even mention hulu in the comment i replied to. You could have been speaking of any streaming service. That's why i pay $11 a month for netflix. I don't ever want to see a commercial unless i absolutely have to. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You might have active sealife on the coasts and near the surface. You won't have life at the bottom like plants where all the chemicals settle. 

This is a problem associated with every delta in the world. It's just worst because the Mississippi river basin covers 47% of the continent of the US.

	<TEXT> Your right. Most of the area around the Mississippi delta is pretty much dead. There is a ton of shit that comes down that river like pesticides/fertilizer used in agriculture that has killed a vast area of life around the delta.

Edit to add sources

http://education.nationalgeographic.com/education/encyclopedia/dead-zone/?ar_a=1

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_zone_(ecology)

The area of temporary hypoxic bottom water that occurs most summers off the coast of Louisiana in the Gulf of Mexico [13] is the largest recurring hypoxic zone in the United States.[14] The Mississippi River, which is the drainage area for 41% of the continental United States, dumps high-nutrient runoff such as nitrogen and phosphorus into the Gulf of Mexico. According to a 2009 fact sheet created by NOAA, "seventy percent of nutrient loads that cause hypoxia are a result of this vast drainage basin."[15] which includes the heart of U.S. agribusiness, the Midwest. The discharge of treated sewage from urban areas (pop. c 12 million in 2009) combined with agricultural runoff deliver c. 1.7 million tons of phosphorus and nitrogen into the Gulf of Mexico every year.[15]

Edit - Should point out i'm not arguing the spill itself, but that the dead zone exists. </TEXT>

Did i say anything about hulu?

I hardly ever watch TV, only live tv i watch is pretty much sports. 

How do you think the content creators fund their projects?

No shit sherlock

If i like something i will actually buy the DVDs instead of sit through even a few 30 seconds commercials on hulu.

I will wait months to watch something on netflix instead of seeing it the day after it airs even with a few commercials.

	<TEXT> In CA is illegal for them to expire unless they were given out for a promotion or to employees.

Most gift certificates and gift cards sold by retail sellers for use with the seller and its affiliates cannot contain an expiration date or a service fee, including a fee for dormancy.

and is pretty much considered legal tender, since it basically is a pre-paid credit card.

Any gift certificate sold after January 1, 1997, is redeemable in cash for its cash value, or subject to replacement with a new gift certificate at no cost to the purchaser or holder.4 Effective January 1, 2008, any gift certificate with a cash value of less than $10 is redeemable in cash, which includes currency or check, for its cash value.

	<TEXT> In 2009, Congress passed the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure (CARD) Act, which set consumer protections for gift cards based on many state laws. The law provides that gift cards cannot expire within five years from the date they were activated and generally limits inactivity fee on gift cards except in certain circumstances, such as if there has been no transaction for at least 12 months. The federal law creates a floor for regulation and leaves room for state regulation on redeeming gift cards for cash and unclaimed property provisions.

	<TEXT> Seems it burns for the first 2 hours, maybe not a burn but makes me  want to scratch it. Hasn't affected me otherwise, it helps a lot actually. 

Edit to add - i have been switching sides of the body. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Was getting ready to leave the house when i saw your comment. Was about the same time i had to replace the patch, so i put it on the back of my shoulder. Actually seems like it will work a lot better.

Thanks

Is the burning sensation normal? I'm assuming it is. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I estimate that this was retired only after 8 years. I worked in a plastic factory and I assume that this would do 4 cycles a min. Times that by 60 for an hour, times that by 24 for a day ( most plastic factories run 24/7 due to the fact that the injectors would fill with hard plastic if left off over night ) then times that by about 365 gives you about 134 million bricks. Now I say 8 years cause there is down time for maintainiance and colour changes. If anyone has a better time frame I would like to know what you think.
