	<TEXT> The quality of line in this isn't on par as far as crisp and clean goes...did you want it in that 2D hand drawn style? If not I would consider going else where. 


Not trying to sound snarky at all by the way, I apologize in advance. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You should really ask the artist you want to tattoo you...Look at their work, if you like their portfolio book a consult. Tell them exactly what you want in as much detail as you can with a defined budget. Then, they should show you this design before your appointment. 


Also, if you do this just as a tip taking the design someone draws for you and getting it tattooed elsewhere is a no no. And give them as much warning as possible if you need to cancel... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I use bedhead, dirty secret dry shampoo and it works perfectly...I tried tresemme, dove, and other brands before this! Only one I would even dream of recommending. Dove also stained my brown hair white. 


Also, make sure you're holding it far enough away from your hair and that you're spraying it through the layers if its longer...
