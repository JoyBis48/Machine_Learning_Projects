	<TEXT> What for? This is a library, app that is "visible" and can be used is just a mock to show how it uses library. Also it won't be possible as Android M isn't still release as API (for example 23) thus also I cannot upload it to jitpack etc. 

Which is a good thing because there can be still some changes before it going public (and I hope so, this library removes only some of pains to use new Permission model). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> To be honest I would suggest traveling to Warsaw/Gdask/Krakw at any occasion that you would have - as Biaystok isn't that much to see. Unless you want to enjoy nature - then mazury is your best bet and it is not that far (great for kayaks/yachts). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I just read this post [Android is finally beating Apple in this one key metric- revenue from apps ](http://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/341k7h/android_is_finally_beating_apple_in_this_one_key/) and as almost half app revenue is from "China market" though it would be good to read about it and maybe try to sell there some apps.


Did you use any Asia markets (competing with Google Play) to sell your apps ? If yes, which ones and what is your opinion? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Go and look for local developers meetups (my personal recommendation - GDG events), most of them have hackathons - events during which teams compete by making apps. In most cases you can join them as a idea person, and see if anybody is up to join your idea and help to create it.

	<TEXT> Hi,
I'm on the edge of going with X1C but only turn down is poor screen brightness mentioned in few reviews.

Can somebody confirm if all panels (HD/QHD/QHD with touch) have similar brightness?

I aiming in HD version but maybe it is worth to pay for better screen this 400$ more. </TEXT>
