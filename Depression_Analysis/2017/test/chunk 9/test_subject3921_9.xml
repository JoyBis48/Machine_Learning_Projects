	<TEXT> Gangs of New York. Daniel Day-Lewis was so evil in that movie but his character was such a bad ass I couldn't help but root for him. Also, DiCaprio annoyed the shit out of me most of the movie and I desperately wanted to see Day-Lewis come out on top.  </TEXT>

Edit: I do not mean the part with his mom dying...I am referring to when he's dancing to Come And Get Your Love by Redbone in the cave. Sorry that may have been misleading. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 127 Hours. That is a movie that I very much enjoy and it is all about a man who has to survive in a canyon for a couple of days after a giant rock pins his arm. James Franco delivers an amazing performance and the film has a great ending.  </TEXT>
