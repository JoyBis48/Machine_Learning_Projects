	<TEXT> Ooh yeah. Well you need to get her to understand the changes in mood and potential of harm she can do. But, shed not going to listen to you if she's impulsive and unhealthy, that's on her and you can't really change that because she'll resent you and then rebel. So, it's kind of something she needs a therapist for. 

Since you're her big brother, she will take what you say and how you act with more emphasis than a parent. You're close in age and did it to. What she's doing isn't all that out of ordinary for a HS  student, but you may need to worry because she was a higher chance of addiction and risky behavior.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Paris was crazy. I literally ran around the city to to each big landmark to make sure I fit it all in. Usually I'd say this doesn't work and not why I travel, but idk, I'm glad I did it. The only thing I'm mad about it not taking much time in the Louvre. That was on my bucket list but skipped through. 

Basically, its up to you. Is the culture or the landmarks more important to you, how do you feel about skipping many major places like the love lock bridge, arch, Louvre and other museums, a few awesome churches, etc. </TEXT>
