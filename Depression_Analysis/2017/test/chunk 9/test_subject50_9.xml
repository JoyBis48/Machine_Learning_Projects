	<TEXT> This isn't legal everywhere. In some places only one person has to know they're being recorded (I'm looking at you AZ) but in others, both do for it to be legal.

Though I've always wondered where things stand when calling a company that says it's going to record the call and you record it also. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, they don't "procreate" as we experience it. This is part of why it's difficult to classify them as alive or dead. They increase in number, like something alive,, but require a host to make the copies for them, unlike something that is alive. In this way they are somewhat like parasites, except those usually increase in number through their own means and just use the host for nutrients or some other way that benefits the parasite. </TEXT>
