	<TEXT> I just watched Alan Partridge and absolutely loved it. That dry, quick humor that's constant in the movie is my favorite. I watched The Trip as a follow up, and it was moderately funny, but not constant enough to have me dying like Partridge did.

Other movies with the kind of humor I'm looking for are In the Loop, Hot Fuzz, Shaun of the Dead, Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, Rushmore, In Bruges, The Guard, etc. 

Any suggestions?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Really? I found that movie to be pretty worthless, if not frustrating. 

There were a few people in there with interesting theories and neat analyses, but they were overshadowed by the idiots talking about random shit. 

What was that lady talking about the drawings her kid made? Or the guy trying to prove Kubrick's face was in the clouds?

Plus it didn't seem very careful production-wise. It was more than obvious that everyone recorded themselves at home with mics of varying quality and no concern for background noise. I remember hearing kids pplaying behind some of the speakers. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think a big part of the movie was the fact that there were plotholes. The scene where she's recanting her stories to the FBI people and any questions from the Sheriff woman are shushed because of the preconceived notion of "innocent little Amy" and the media's role in how people perceive the couple and treat the case, overlooked evidence against her case in favor of their unfairly biased ideas, are pretty huge. Especially with the whole Nancy Grace parody thing running in the background. </TEXT>
