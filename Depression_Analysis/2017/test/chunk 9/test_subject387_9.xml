	<TEXT> I think your best option now is to remain blue belt as long as you possibly can before it becomes obvious that you should move up a belt

I will take that advice. Thank you very much. I'm also a pretty light fighter, constantly drifting from 135-145ish not really staying consistent because local tournaments don't weight color belts, they just size them up based on looks. I will go to Qualifiers next year at 128 lbs and, eventually, as a Black Belt I will compete at Fin, lowest, at 120 lbs.

You're worrying that you will not be leaving behind a legacy like theirs but you only have good thinks to look forward to, you're young and have lots of potential.

Thank you very much for your reassurance. For awhile I haven't felt young anymore because I'm not a Junior yet at the same time I'm not old enough 30+ to where I'm just doing this for recreation like the older crowd and parents in the adult classes.  But you're right, I'm still young and I can only grow from here. My goal is to win a National Championship under my belt.  Even if I'll only ever win as a color belt, I would be proud of myself if I can claim the Gold next year.  Looking forward to all the progress ahead of me! 

If I may ask, were you nervous at all to compete as a Black Belt for the first time? Or had it just felt like any other competition.

	<TEXT> crosspost from /r/martialarts. The community there is more active so I posted there initially but this is where this post really fits:

Hey, /r/taekwondo... I'm in an awkward position. As a Blue Belt in Taekwondo with close to two years of training under my belt, I figure I'm doing alright at my level. I've done well at each local tournament sanctioned by the USAT since switching over to a USAT Taekwondo Dojang. 

A year ago I never would've thought I would be able to do the things I'm doing now. I just wanted to do Taekwondo for recreation since I always loved watching Martial Arts films featuring Jackie Chan or Bruce Lee with those athletic kicks they displayed on-screen. The initial dojang I started with was part of a chain of several dojangs and, unfortunately, the particular dojang I trained at was not very good - at least for me. [It was such a bad fit for me that at one point I considered quitting Taekwondo altogether.](https://www.reddit.com/r/martialarts/comments/2hb00k/should_i_drop_taekwondo_for_muay_thai/)

Thankfully, I listened to your guys' advice and found a great dojang that I transferred to. I have a good relationship with my coach/master, I consider him an uncle, as well as many of the students that I train with. Amazingly, since I started training over here, my skills have improved tremendously since I started. So much so that watching old videos of me sparring from when I was still training over at my previous dojang makes me cringe.

The dojang I currently train under has produced very many successful Taekwondo competitors. Several National Champions, USA National Team Members, and countless other achievements have been born from here. A year ago I never would've thought that I would be able to potentially compete at such a high level but now, knowing so, it makes me afraid to try.

This year following the National USA Taekwondo Tournament in Austin, Texas we have 4 students from our Dojang that qualified to make the National Team, 2 of which will be competing in the Cadet World Championships in Korea.

I'm amazed at how good everyone around me is... however, that's also what makes me somewhat disappointed...

I'm 18 years old. A lot of these guys have been training since they were little kids and have kept training for over 6-10+ years. Everyone that has done exceptionally well, like capture a Title [ex: National Champion], have done so under 18.  If you don't quite follow what I'm saying yet, you will.

I've met a lot of great martial artists, Black Belts, here since I started. We had a bunch of them that were 18+, or turning 17-18 [AKA making the Senior Division - sparring in the 18-32 age group] that were doing really well but eventually stopped competing competitively, or quit altogether.  Unfortunately some of them were also kicked out of the dojang for coming in and teaching classes under the influence.

The circle of high-level Black Belts in the Senior Division is not very big. Therefore, all the big names are well-known. As a kid you have plenty of opportunities to compete, but the problem for me... as an Adult is that the guys in the Black Belt Senior Division have kept training since they were a kid and are *exceptionally* outstanding.

So much so that people stop competing once they reach Senior age because they're afraid or they see that they've reached the end of their journey as a competitor and they cannot go any further.

I'm afraid this is what will happen to me when I reach Black Belt next year. 

Last night I went out with a couple of my friends, Black Belts from the dojang, and they talked about all the great competitors that used to train here.  Though I didn't know any of them, personally, I do know they were really successful during their career.  Unfortunately, I felt really left out since I couldn't relate to any of what they were saying or what they've accomplished. 

When I leave for University in a year or so, will I be remembered at all?  For anything...

I started Taekwondo when I was 17 and I'm turning 19 soon... so I never had the opportunity to spar at a less-extreme level of competition. Even now, it's not that intense because I'm still a color belt but like I said earlier, the circle of Black Belt Senior competitors isn't especially huge compared to Junior Black Belts or even Senior/Junior Color Belts. (There are guys that could very well qualify for the Olympics in this division, even at just the National Level Competitions)

I regret not starting Martial Arts earlier when I was a kid. I wish I had more opportunities to grow, earn more tournament experience, and make mistakes before I had to compete in the Senior Division.

For now, I'm okay... as I'm still a Color Belt but the fact that my coach and my friends around me push me to promote to the next level worries me.  I don't feel like I deserve to move up to Red Belt, which is right underneath Black.  That would put a lot of pressure on me to have a high-level of skill - which I do not possess as of yet...
I like where I'm at because I think it suits me.  I'm not a beginner and I'm not really experienced enough to be advanced. Blue Belt... right in the middle - Intermediate.  I think that describes me well.

A year ago I was always excited for the next belt promotion but now that I'm doing Taekwondo not just for recreation but for competition, the next promotion just worries me.  I don't think I'm good enough. I don't think I deserve what's ahead of me... at the same time, I can't just stay here forever.  What is life without progress?

In the Senior Black Belt Division, all Black Belts are put up against one another in each weight class regardless of the level of their experience as a Black Belt.  You can have someone who just got their 1st Degree and has been training for 3 years go up against someone that's been a Black Belt for 3 years and has been training for over 10 years consecutively altogether... 

That's worries me the most... especially seeing how one of the coaches, who personally coached me for a National Qualifier Tournament last year, from another chain dojang that was tied to my previous dojang is now a USA National Champion in the Senior Division.  Knowing that in a year or so that I could potentially be put up against him since we could be in the same weight division scares me.

I'm stuck. I keep choking... seeing how all my friends that have done so well eventually dropped out after they've reached Senior Division age or after just a few competitions in that Division.

Once I reach Black Belt, will my career as a competitor also be over? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey, /r/martialarts... I'm in an awkward position. As a Blue Belt in Taekwondo with close to two years of training under my belt, I figure I'm doing alright at my level. I've done well at each local tournament sanctioned by the USAT since switching over to a USAT Taekwondo Dojang. 

A year ago I never would've thought I would be able to do the things I'm doing now. I just wanted to do Taekwondo for recreation since I always loved watching Martial Arts films featuring Jackie Chan or Bruce Lee with those athletic kicks they displayed on-screen. The initial dojang I started with was part of a chain of several dojangs and, unfortunately, the particular dojang I trained at was not very good - at least for me. [It was such a bad fit for me that at one point I considered quitting Taekwondo altogether.](https://www.reddit.com/r/martialarts/comments/2hb00k/should_i_drop_taekwondo_for_muay_thai/)

Thankfully, I listened to your guys' advice and found a great dojang that I transferred to. I have a good relationship with my coach/master, I consider him an uncle, as well as many of the students that I train with. Amazingly, since I started training over here, my skills have improved tremendously since I started. So much so that watching old videos of me sparring from when I was still training over at my previous dojang makes me cringe.

The dojang I currently train under has produced very many successful Taekwondo competitors. Several National Champions, USA National Team Members, and countless other achievements have been born from here. A year ago I never would've thought that I would be able to potentially compete at such a high level but now, knowing so, it makes me afraid to try.

This year following the National USA Taekwondo Tournament in Austin, Texas we have 4 students from our Dojang that qualified to make the National Team, 2 of which will be competing in the Cadet World Championships in Korea.

I'm amazed at how good everyone around me is... however, that's also what makes me somewhat disappointed...

I'm 18 years old. A lot of these guys have been training since they were little kids and have kept training for over 6-10+ years. Everyone that has done exceptionally well, like capture a Title [ex: National Champion], have done so under 18.  If you don't quite follow what I'm saying yet, you will.

I've met a lot of great martial artists, Black Belts, here since I started. We had a bunch of them that were 18+, or turning 17-18 [AKA making the Senior Division - sparring in the 18-32 age group] that were doing really well but eventually stopped competing competitively, or quit altogether.  Unfortunately some of them were also kicked out of the dojang for coming in and teaching classes under the influence.

The circle of high-level Black Belts in the Senior Division is not very big. Therefore, all the big names are well-known. As a kid you have plenty of opportunities to compete, but the problem for me... as an Adult is that the guys in the Black Belt Senior Division have kept training since they were a kid and are *exceptionally* outstanding.

But if she won't even talk to the guy closest to her, in the literal sense, then yeah it's a lost cause. She's a cool girl, at the very least I want to keep her around even if it means putting her off. Thanks for the comment. 

I had a strong feeling we were gonna get together or hook up the first night but I didn't want to go too forward because it seemed way too soon so, maybe I missed my opportunity or maybe I did the right thing. Only time will tell I guess. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Okay, good points man. 

That tension you felt when the moment seemed right to kiss her but you talked yourself out of it? Don't let that happen again.

Agreed. 


Stop with being her taxi and BFF or at least give her the silent trip for the ride and if you do give her a ride try to kiss her. 

At this point, I'm not quite sure what I can say or do to lead up to this kiss. I kind of feel like I fucked up last night, I know it was just a txt convo but still. If it's just a silent ride... I don't want her to feel awkward or anything but yeah that'll give her the message.

I can't do both though. What do you think I should do? Obviously, I can't give her a silent trip *and* try to kiss her. And I can't just do it out the blue without any prior convo/lead up. 

Eh, my bad if I'm being difficult.

I just feel like there's still potential here and I want to salvage every last bit of it. 

Really appreciate the advice.

I guess you could do it at the end of the drive before you leave the car. Just say something like "lets finish this conversation on Friday night, I'd like to take you out for drinks".

Not drinking age yet haha but I'll ask her if she wants to grab a bite to eat this Saturday since I'm off work. Hopefully she's off work too but, even so, if she's into me she'll try to make time. Thanks, man. I'll ask her out when I drop her off.

Asking her if she wants to see a movie might be too cheesy and easily flawed. Can't think of anything to do and we've pretty much been hanging out already in the car.

I want to make a remark at her about that dead-convo last night though just to see if I can pry something out of her. Should I be like, "By the way, you suck at texting for someone who loves talking, haha" or something? I want to know what's/what was on her mind. </TEXT>

I did, but she said she doesn't eat past 7 because of cutting weight. Went through a drive-thru to get us some drinks though. At several points I did want to kiss her and I felt like it would've been perfect but I didn't want it to be so soon since I've literally started talking to her for like two days.

Didn't feel like I was overtexting her, but the conversation definitely ended short.

I'm seeing her again tonight when I pick up her up for class, should I mention/bring up that text convo from last night? Also, how would you suggest I "fix" this? </TEXT>
