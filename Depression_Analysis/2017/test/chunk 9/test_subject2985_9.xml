So by the end of the democratic primary, we'll know who our next president is. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> [Race info](http://www.barebutts5k.com/race/bucket-list-race/)

[Sunshower's website](http://www.sunshower.com/)

Some commonly asked questions:

**Do I have to be naked?**

For the race, no. Clothing optional. I don't know about afterwards at the resort. Normally it's nude-only, but since the event is CO, they may make an exception at the resort (though definitely not in the pool). Call to verify.

**Why naked?**

Why not? Seriously,  attend any socially nude event, and within 5 minutes not only do you forget that everyone is naked (including yourself), but you also forget why you cared in the first place. You stop seeing "naked people" and you just see "people".

More to the point, it's incredibly freeing to be casually naked with others. There's no judgement, no shame, no staring, no prejudices, no barriers, and no pointless swimsuits.

You really have to try it to fully understand it, but once you do, you'll be hooked.

**What if I don't look good naked?**

One of the other things that becomes immediately apparent in a clothing optional environment is that nobody has a perfect body, and that's okay. You often hear people make remarks like "nudists are usually the people you don't want to see naked". That misses the point entirely (you don't go to *see* people naked, you go to *be* naked and to relax and have fun), but there is some truth in it in that many people attend clothing optional events/clubs because they want to learn to love (or at least stop hating) their bodies. Years, even decades, of body shame melt away almost immediately once you let go of the fear and shame embrace the idea that there's nothing wrong or embarrassing about your body.

Plus, everyone is naked, so nobody is going to judge, look down on, or gawk at you.

**Is this about sex?**

No. On the contrary, most nudist resorts (including this one) are family oriented, which means any overt sexual activity or sexual advances would result in the offender being immediately thrown out, and most likely arrested. A good rule to follow is if it would get you in trouble at a community pool or rec center, it will get you in trouble at a nudist resort (except taking your clothes off, of course).

Despite what society would have us believe, nudity is not inherently sexual (just as something sexual does not necessarily involve nudity). This is another one of those things that you just have to experience to fully believe, but within minutes the nudity becomes normalized and you quickly see there's nothing sexy about it. It's just people.

**What if I become aroused?**

You won't.

**But what if I do?**

You won't. Every guy worries about this their first time, but it's never an issue. The advice that always given is that if the wrong thought or breeze or whatever causes a situation, just go swim or lie belly-down on your towel for a minute, but I've never seen or heard of anyone actually having to do this.. Nudists are open-minded, accepting people (and they're all naked too), so if that were to happen, as long as you didn't provoke, flaunt, or maintain it, nobody is going to care (or probably even notice, people will be looking you in the eye, not the crotch).

Trust me, this is about as sexy as going to the doctor, you really won't have an issue.

**What if it's that time of the month?**

Nudist clubs always allow women to wear bottoms (even in the pool) if it's that time of the month. I don't see that listed on Sunshower's website, but it's almost certainly the case.

**What should I bring?**

A towel, which you'll use not only to dry off if you go swimming, but also to put down any time you want to sit down (no bare butts on chairs!). You'll also want plenty of sunscreen (I'd bring both a 30SPF and something lighter like an 8 to re-apply if you're not completely dry), and some money for food/drinks. You might also want to bring a book, frisbee, tennis racket (I see a court on the website, though it probably also doubles as a volleyball court), etc.. Other than that you just need an open mind and a smile!

**Other questions**

Feel free to ask.


Hope to see you there! </TEXT>
