	<TEXT> Also, it is worth noting that since 2010 Wisconsin has followed textbook GOP policies, while Minnesota has followed textbook progressive policies. Wisconsin is 44th in job creation, and has had sluggish economic growth with a budget deficit - while Minnesota's budgets are balanced, and has a booming economy.

Same stories are for NJ, Kansas and Louisiana. 

Even after all these data points - I struggle to understand why any sane American can support the GOP's economic policies. </TEXT>

For the last few years, someone is accused of a crime, and then a few weeks later they get a clean chit. I thought you needed a prosecution, judiciary and all that stuff to determine guilt and innocence. Or are we just dealing in clean chits now? </TEXT>
