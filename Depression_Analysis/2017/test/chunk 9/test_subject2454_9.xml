	<TEXT> I want to use this shake as a meal replacement, but not for all three meals, like the website suggests.  Maybe one or two meals a day.

My question is, is this too good to be true?  All the nutrients we need for a keto diet in a simple shake?  There's not uch information on the website, so I don't know where else to turn.  Asking the company itself to critique their product seems counter productive.

	<TEXT> Oh absolutely it's better than 90% of what's out there.  I'd even bump it up to 99%.

When I said I was disappointed in HBO's writers, it was in comparison to their own work, not others.  They've set such a high standard for themselves, I felt that they didn't live up to expectations.

It's the old Soviet factory problem.  If you work too hard, the boss expects more of you each time. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I've read some material saying that keto is ok for diabetics, and people with kidney stones are not in any danger on this diet.  But those seemed to be opinion pieces.

Are there any hard scientific sources supporting a ketogenic lifestyle for someone with kidney stones who is borderline diabetic?

My neighbor fits into this category, and I don't want to give him wrong information.  He's been making great progress, but he told me he is pre-diabetic, has kidney stones, and gets occasional gout flareups.

He's so far done it by plain old calorie restriction, but now he wants to cut out carbs all together. </TEXT>

A little bluetooth here, some rear camera there, and that's it.  I thought that a 5 year break in between models would offer significant upgrades, or at least changes.  Everything seems the same, or just negligibly improved.  Even the gas mileage is the same.  NO IMPROVEMENTS TO MPG IN 5 YEARS?  No other car company has stagnated like that.

I guess I'll keep this one for another 120,000 miles. </TEXT>
