	<TEXT> When Albus found Harry staring into the mirror, and the whole 'it does not do to dwell' speech.

There is no way he (Albus) could have known Harry was there unless he was already in the room staring into the mirror of desire himself.

It's my theory that Dumbledore was looking into the mirror and heard the door open, so he backed into the shadows and disillusioned himself. When he didn't see anyone open and close the door, he assumed it was Harry because he had just given him the cloak on Christmas.

Albus probably stood there and let Harry enjoy one more bit of time looking at his family before he finally moves it.

	<TEXT> An old hillbilly farmer had a wife who nagged him unmercifully. From morning till night (and sometimes later), she was always complaining about something. The only time he got any relief was when he was out plowing with his old mule. He tried to plow a lot.
One day, when he was out plowing, his wife brought him lunch in the field. He drove the old mule into the shade, sat down on a stump, and began to eat his lunch. Immediately, his wife began haranguing him again. Complain, nag, nag; it just went on and on.
All of a sudden, the old mule lashed out with both hind feet; caught her smack in the back of the head. Killed her dead on the spot.
At the funeral several days later, the minister noticed something rather odd. When a woman mourner would approach the old farmer, he would listen for a minute, then nod his head in agreement; but when a man mourner approached him, he would listen for a minute, then shake his head in disagreement. This was so consistent, the minister decided to ask the old farmer about it.
So after the funeral, the minister spoke to the old farmer, and asked him why he nodded his head and agreed with the women, but always shook his head and disagreed with all the men. The old farmer said: "Well, the women would come up and say something about how nice my wife looked, or how pretty her dress was, so I'd nod my head in agreement."
"And what about the men?" the minister asked. "They wanted to know if the mule was for sale." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Correct. The ministry was conducting raids looking for dark objects, and Lucy thought he could get two birds stoned at once by planting the diary on Arthur Weasley's (who was overseeing the raids) daughter to incriminate them both. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Shit man, since no one else is saying it, *levicorpus* was not a commonly known spell to children of Potter's age. It was created by Snape, and went in and out of fashion, but not a commonly known spell that parents would teach their children... *colloportus* is a spell to lock doors, the reverse of *alohamora.* </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No shit. I probably saw over 400 games there, and I completely hated that stadium. I saw from Johnny Bench night in 81 through 4,192 through the 90 wire to wire. Probably saw 40 games that year, I got in free as a teen because my buddies dad was the head of security. All the way to the beginning of the remodel.
