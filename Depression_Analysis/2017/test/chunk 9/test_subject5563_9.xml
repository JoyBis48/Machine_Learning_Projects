	<TEXT> It's just so poorly edited, you have no idea what is going on when the main character is fighting anyone, and this isn't shakycam it's actually the editing, it feels so off. I feel the main reason for this is because it was PG-13 along with Taken 2 which had bad editing as well. Such a shame because if both films were still R-rated then we probably wouldn't have this shitty editing.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Lol mate you have to be joking. AoU was nowhere near as bad as you remember it. Yeah that scene where he walks up to an old John Deere tractor they don't even sell anymore which is contextually located in it's natural habitat, A FARM, combined with his character making a snarky pun... Or that 2 second shot of Quicksilver grabbing Adidas shoes out of his closet? Your examples suck and the fact that you tried to say that the product placement in AoU wasn't as bad as Transformers shows why no one has taken your opinion seriously. 

Take your [pill](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4YwLlB9daM) and rethink your argument.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's super expensive to make unfortunately. Look at Final Fantasy: Spirits Within, it was a more mature animated film which pushed the boundaries of computer animation, but in the end it bombed. Now there's a variety of factors as to why it bombed (which may have been prevented) but it was a very expensive bomb which seems to have had a lasting effect on the green lighting of these types of projects.  </TEXT>
