	<TEXT> I've been using the reddit is fun app for quite some time, and have made the transition over to relay. The app is beautiful looking. The one thing that is really bugging me is that it is impossible to read through a really long thread. While scrolling, if I make the slightest sideways movement with my thumb, it exits the thread and takes me back to the front page. I've had to open this thread over 5 times and try to relocate the place I left off. 

Another issue I'm running into is that YouTube links will not open when the thumbnail is clicked (the internal browser doesn't work), but it will run the video in the YouTube app if I click on the title of the post. 

Overall, the app has a beautiful appearance, but some functionality issues are bugging me a bit.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A good thing it remember is that every medication effects every person really differently. The best person to talk to is a doc or a psychiatrist.

I took Welbutrin, and I noticed that while it did help my levels of motivation, that it murdered my appetite and increased my levels of anxiety. Usually with every anti-depressant, you're going to take it for 2 weeks and feel little to nothing (except I felt quite a bit of energy the first 2 days of welbutrin), and then around that 2 week mark is when you start feeling the changes your medication will bring. 

I can tell you that I took effexor for quite a long time, and while starting it (especially while leveling up doses), I couldn't even form sentences. My brain was just adjusting hardcore and I was totally just lost in a fog for a couple days. It went away quickly, though.

If what you're feeling persists for too long (a week, or less if you're real uncomfortable), talk to who prescribed it to ya. </TEXT>

Thank you,

Brother,    
you will always be

And thank you    
for the courage,    
when I go too far...

Knowing    
you'll never walk away,

You know...

	<TEXT> You're gonna make it. You're one of the very few people I see that knows they're depressed and **wants** to get help. That's really great to see.

If you feel that a stay in the hospital would be fitting for you, I'd advise to not shy away from it. While it was a hard experience, it gives a person the tools they need to really begin to start changing their life.

If you want to look into therapy, try out this awesome resource: https://therapists.psychologytoday.com/rms/

Put in your zip, instantly get a lot of therapists around you - and you can sort by price per session (it shows what insurances they accept). I've personally gone with a therapist off there who offered $35 per session over the table, and it's one of the best choices I ever made.

That website allows you to send emails directly to each therapist, and in emailing 4 that I saw, I found that they all reply really quickly.

Just introduce yourself, and ask what their availability is like :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey there.

I feel you - I get what you're feeling. I just wanted to pop in and say that I'm feeling the same, even today. I'm a type of person that is always looking for music to comfort me in every situation, and for this situation I've got [this song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQ7hdF7Xyns), actually called "Why Won't They Talk To Me." If you're interested in music at all, have a listen. If you like it, that whole album (Called Lonerism) really reflects that same feeling of people around you just isolating you. A few tracks are sort of like - hey fuck them, I'm better off by myself anyways (Track: Solitude is Bliss.)

Best of luck, friend. I'm trying my best to start meeting new people, because while I feel that I'm always there for everyone around me - when it comes to me being down, no one is ever really there. It's a shitty feeling to have. </TEXT>

They do have beginner setups and actual vials of Eliquid with fruity flavors. Never tried it, but I support them. I got one of their cigalikes and it of course tasted real bad, but it's the only cigalike I'll use if my setup breaks down.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> To add onto this, I believe you're having dry hits because of the massive amount of wick. Generally, in addition to having it pulled through the coil, you'll want as little cotton as possible. Because you've got quite a bit of wick, the liquid in the wick is all sitting elsewhere and not able to move very fast to the spot you're heating with the coil. 

My general rule of thumb when wicking is to put enough wick through the coil so it's not thin enough to slide through the coil on its own (without you pulling it), but it's not ever getting stuck in or choked by the coil (not difficult to pull through at all). 

Also, is your coil getting red hot while it's wicked? That shouldn't ever happen. Something is up there, too.  </TEXT>
