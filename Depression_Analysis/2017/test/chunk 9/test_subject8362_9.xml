	<TEXT> That's it. I am deleting my Reddit app. I don't need to come back anymore. It can't get any better than this...





Who am I kidding... Reddit owns me. I'll be back tomorrow. Or in an hour. Or maybe I will just keep browsing for a little bit longer(4-5 hours longer will suffice for tonight). </TEXT>
