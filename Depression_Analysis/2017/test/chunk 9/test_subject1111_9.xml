	<TEXT> Yup, I was there for the filming for the last scenes of the film you saw last night and I can't quite get my head around people complaining to the BBC about a promo voiceover.

Pretty sure that Clarkson and co wouldn't give the smallest imaginable shit about it either. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Nah, it's just a programme about cars where the three blokes who make it are moving on and some other bloke will start again next year. Stuff changes, and it really isn't worth over dramatising. In fact, I'm pretty sure that a BBC trail for Gardener's World or some such would probably fit well with previous comments made by the (now old) team regarding not over dramatising such matters.

Now if you want a /proper/ ending, try the last episode of Blackadder 4...they certainly didn't talk over that one! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Err, I have a 1TB SSD in my laptop and have done for well over a year now. Quite cheap now too :-)

Seriously, for general OS use, there is simply no comparison and if you do any "real" work (I'm a DBA) they are 100x quicker than spinning rust.

I get your reliability concerns, but spinning disks fail too and in a laptop are much more sensitive to shocks. Running a regular disk does not mean you don't need to run backups! </TEXT>

Lotus did, however, design the TG track layout that has been used since the start of the most recent incarnation.

Wouldn't surprise me if the BBC even had this sewn up tight however... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Interesting view :-)

I would also argue the other way around - that people are made more attractive for breeding by their wealth even though they clearly should be bottom of the pile when it comes to the gene pool!

	<TEXT> There's a huge difference in speed between 2G and 3G. Full strength 2G is still likely to be 10x slower than 1 bar of 3G, but on the whole, if you have fringe 3G coverage you are likely to be booted from the cell and thus drop down to 2G resulting in a large drop in connectivity performance. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Funny sticker, but why do people consider acquisition of wealth to be the ultimate goal of life?

Personally, I consider personal gratification and happiness to be orders of magnitude more important than wealth and I find that children help me in this. If you can do it without, then excellent too :-) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Great write up, ignore the idiots!

One thing that I will add is that 3G networks capacity manage differently to 2G and 4G networks. When a 3G cell manages its capacity, it will tend to kick off devices running at the highest RF output power, on the basis that these are geographically furthest away and therefore most likely to be serviced by another cell.

This works well in a city when there is a lot of overlapping cells, but when you are operating on the edge of a 3G area it actually means that you are more likely to find yourself being bumped to 2G even though your 3G service was acceptably good. 4G does not capacity manage in this way and is a superior network technology, regardless of the speed boost it might bring you. </TEXT>
