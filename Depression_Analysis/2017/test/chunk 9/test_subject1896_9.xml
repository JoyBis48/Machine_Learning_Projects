	<TEXT> Hi guys

I'm used to eating rice, for every meal. Or some form of starch like potatoes.

However, I know that rice is high in calories, esp the amount I'm used to eating. Is there an alternative to rice that's lower in calories, that would fill me up along side my protein? I've started introducing more vegetables to my plate, but it's not the same.

Thanks!

	<TITLE> A couple things that have helped me avoid eating when I'm not hungry. </TITLE>

	<TEXT> The first is a tip that I got in a question I posed earlier this year.

1. Say "I'll eat it later." As the lovely commenter told me, later often doesn't come. However, in my mind, it's nice to know that I could eat it if I wanted to, but won't.

2. Brush your teeth after your meal. As we learned growing up, brushing your teeth is often equated with not eating for the next few hours.


Hope these little things help you on your journey! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I work in social media marketing and I've had very different experiences with Facebook ads. Facebook ads have tremendously helped my clients reach audiences they sought out to reach.

What it takes is extremely good targeting. Geo targeting, interests, demographics, etc. Though, I don't deny the claims the presenter makes, I think there is a way to be successful with them. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Usually, when I'm out of position with a decent hand like AK or mid-small pair and the flop comes something like J74r or even J44 (or in other words, a flop that I think could have missed us both), then I check.  If the villain makes a smallish bet, I will call. Then on the turn, if it helps me or not, I will bet, and 75% of the time, the villain will fold. </TEXT>
