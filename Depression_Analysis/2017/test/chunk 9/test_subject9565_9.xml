"He told me he catfished isn't because he's gay, but because he likes to roleplay as a girl. Because he said he wondered what it would be like to be born as a girl and stuff like that'' he's gay and theres nothing wrong with that.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm currently in the washroom on the floor while writing this so im sorry if nothimg makez sense. After my dad battling cancer for four years and since September it has been downhill it's hard to know how you are going to feel when you are actually in that position.  It sucks big time being in a room surrounded with people crying. I hate it and I feel so overwhelmed because it happened in a snap of fingers. It sucks and I have exams starting tomorrow. I'm going to stay strong because my dad would want that for me. 

I believe in this saying with every curse there is a blessing. 

Because of the decline of my dad's health I matured and now I can cook and be more independent.  

I needed to vent 

Thanks </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My dad has a rare form of pancreatic cancer (Steve Jobs had it) since Sept 2010. My dad still worked and was able to live his life besides the one set back.  Before my dad went to the hospital, I couldn't bake and cook for my life. I relied a lot on my mothers cooking. Things went for a turn for the worst when he went to the hospital Canadian Thanksgiving weekend and has been ever since. We found out the cancer is terminal since there is no cure. The radiation is just to slow it down so its a matter of when.   Since my mom is rarely home for dinner I found a new passion for baking/cooking. It is so therapeutic for me. Now I can bake from cookies to apple cakes as well as cook chicken  fish. I don't know how I cope with everything but I'm so thankful I found baking. I love seeing the smiles of peoples faces when I give to to them. I don't eat a lot of my baked goods because I want to give it to others and make their day because I know it would make mine. I'm writing this because these past few months have been difficult and not easy with keeping up with school but if you or anyone is in a similar situtation. Finding something to distract you for a bit and make you happy even for a minute can make a difference and make things a tad bit easier! Plus Taylor Swift since her album came at a perfect time. Going in the car and blasting her music (been a fan since 06) is one of my favourite things about my day.

FYI: do have depression and last year was VERY difficult for me because I started to have suicidal thoughts. But baking/movies help me! I do have friends I don't have many but I got a good group of people.  </TEXT>

I may not know what its like, but I'm facing a similar situation. My father has cancer- the one Steve Jobs has. He's at the hospital and theres no cure. Find something to  help you through this difficult time- I bake, watch movies and I cook. I also like to humour people so all those help me through it. You are not alone. I'm so sorry.  </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2014-10-20 21:18:48 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> This is me and his first relationship! Me and Bob (fake name) were dating for 4 months. My father is in the hospital and my dad cancer is not treatable. He has a rare form of pancreatic cancer the one that Steve Jobs had. I went to a hospital 2 hours away from home because my dad has a good relationship with them for the past four years and they specialize in his type of cancer.  My friends have been texting more than my then boyfriend and for 3 days he did not text me. He did say if I need to talk to him, he's there but i was pissed because for 3 days I didn't get a single message from him so after thinking about it because I know it must be hard but I warned him on the first date about my dad. I know its hard, but how long does it take to send a text? 2 seconds! So I dumped him because he wasn't being there for me. I wanted closure so a few days after I texted him, he got confused on the texting part if it was after the breakup or when he was in the hospital. So I told him 3 days i was in the hospital, he just send a text how he wants to meet in person to try and work this out. I'm conflicted and I really do not need anymore stress than I do now.  
---   
**tl;dr**: Should I hear my then boyfriends ''reasons''?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My dad has a rare form of pancreatic cancer for four years (since Sept 2010). Recently a tumour in the liver exploded about a month ago and that's when things got downhill. I found out yesterday the radation is to slow things down and to keep the few healthy liver cells alive. We do not know if it's going to work. He hasn't had a appiette in a week and today he had one as well as very alert. He told me that he is going to die but he wants to die with dignity. It just sucks knowing that your father won't be here. I just want the waiting game to be over. </TEXT>
