	<TEXT> to be honest  - don't start to believe in free lunch - Microsoft is  giving  this for free, not because they love us very much but if they not, they would stay by the empty the table with this wonderful software.   It's economy law  - you couldn't expect to take too much for a product above its cost and not loosing  your share of the market. This is how open source had happen. 
Back to VSO - it's good but not quite Carling - just old Microsoft habit to be arrogance with making around UI. Tiles interface had it's go with win8 and failed - it's just like to change one day law and ask drivers to drive on the left hand side of the road (or opposite if you in UK).
Seams to me new CEO understand why open source happened and this is really good even for open source  ;-) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's perfect evidence for my conception "how is possibly to ride on two wheels" - by using handlebars for keeping balance - not just using gyroscopic effect. Everyone now how to do this but none knows how they do it. Similar situation to learning to walk - baby doesn't have any knowledge how to do a small walk but it have a hint by observing others people that it's possibly than by try and error  method gradually train neurons path to react accordingly  to situation.
