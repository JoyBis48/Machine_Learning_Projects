	<TEXT> His claim is that solar energy is established enough that is attracts private financing - so it doesn't need government investments.  He says he wants to see the CEFC invest in new/emerging technologies instead.

I'm an American, so I dont know much beyond that.  Most articles I have read pretty much portray him as a bit of an asshole.  My paraphrasing of his CEFC ideals comes from this:

As an example, with my 20m downstream, I dont have to throttle my torrenting if I have a single HD stream going.  YMMV. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have no substantiated idea.

That said, my belief leans toward food processing and/or pesticides.  "Organic" food definitely gives me less, if no, noticeable/quantifiable reactions.

What has been a recurring indicator for this, in my experience, is nuts, seeds, and seeded fruits.  If I buy cheap stuff I likely will have allergic reaction that turns into acne.  If I buy better (i.e. organic) stuff, its much less likely to happen - if at all.

My food allergy is tied with acne breakouts, so I can see/feel/itch direct correlations between these things when I eat them.  I will itch within hours, and breakouts will follow.  I really cannot say how this compares to others. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would agree that diet influences acne.  I first noticed this ~20 years ago when I started to travel for work.  I have observed the following over the years:

1. Food in the US gives me more acne problems than any other country.
2. Food from grocery stores in major cities gives me more acne problems. Smaller rural/self-sufficient farming areas give me less acne problems for the same kinds of foods I would eat in an urban/industrial environment.

I stand by the assertion that its food, and not pollution, because I know (have been tested) my acne is food-allergy driven. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Re-read what you just said, while recalling the contents of the video.

If he was on the shoulder, the cop would have cited him for it.  The rider said that he was in the lane; which in this context of a motorcycle passing cars is called "lane-splitting".

Watching for motorcycles on your right is more dangerous than on your left, as a vehicle passenger-side mirror (typically) makes the image smaller.  A motorcycle is difficult enough to distinguish in heavy traffic.

To answer your question, AFAIK the motorcycle would be at fault.  Lane-splitting isn't technically "legal".  Its just something that CHP turns a blind-eye to.  But they do not declare it as a legal/valid thing for motorcycles to do, and so it does not have any right-of-way privs, etc. </TEXT>

Source: I live in a heavily Mexican populated neighborhood of Los Angeles, California, and this is my loose interpretation of what I see/hear going on around me *every f'ing weekend*.

Wikipedia offers this expanded [explanation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quincea%C3%B1era):

 Quinceaera (pronounced: [knsee]; feminine form of "fifteen-year-old"), also called fiesta de quince aos, fiesta de quinceaera, quince aos or simply quince, is the celebration of a girl's fifteenth birthday in parts of Latin America and elsewhere in communities of people from Latin America. This birthday is celebrated differently from any other as it marks the transition from childhood to young womanhood. Latin myths and tradition tell about how girls were prepared to be married by the age of fifteen; in the years prior to their fifteenth birthdays, girls were taught to cook, weave, and about child rearing by the elder women in their communities in preparation for their lives as married women. Although it is agreed that the traditions of quinceaeras originated in ancient Aztec culture, the celebrations today vary significantly across countries; celebrations in some countries, for example, have taken on more religious overtones than in others. </TEXT>

If you have any doubts, watch the movie [Haywire](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1506999/).  Sure, she's done some crap, but Haywire is a good movie, has a great supporting cast, and was directed by a good director. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> To be fair, since the new update, I initially saw the box ad (3) times after the last update took place.  It has since disappeared, and I haven't seen an ad since.  There is no empty placemark for the ad or anything - the menu has collapsed/compressed back into place.

I have all of the privacy/ad-related options in the system settings turned off, so I'm considering chalking this up as being a glitch.  I never saw ads before when there was an initial outcry. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I had never heard of this guy until recently, and I'm not promoting him - I'm just impressed that he did this:

 The Sanders administration [when mayor of Burlington, VT] also "sued the local cable franchise and won reduced rates for customers."

I saw The Daily Show make fun of him a few weeks back, and the guy did seem kinda bat-shit crazy:

Footage like this looks really cool until you are outside somewhere trying to enjoy the scenery/view/etc, and some jackass is buzzing around with one of these things.  These things are not quiet.  They are just like other powerful RC devices: *they are loud*. 

I had the displeasure of having to deal with a jackass up on Glacier Point (Yosemite National Park) who was running one of these things back and forth along the cliffs edge getting footage of himself standing there. </TEXT>
