	<TEXT> by black do you mean graphic glitches?  
i'd suggest you to update your graphic card(s) drivers and check it out if its occurring.  

Also you could do a refresh(you'll lose add-ons) if problems seem to take place within safe-mode as well.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> i have a dell too. And yes Lenovo is the best! :D  

Thing is you need to have both cards to be enabled to use bumblebee. Your manufacturer has allowed a bios option to use specifically one; which is good in a way since you can choose what your want, but you'll have to reboot and set it again if you want to use the other.  

What bumblebee does is, it auto-manages both the cards on the fly; most of the time intel will be active(as it does all normal stuff fine, and is light on battery) while the Nvidia card is used for heavy graphics apps(Heavy on battery and heating).  

You can specifically have bumblebee run on the heavy Nvidia card by using the optirun command for an app (eg. optirun firefox).  
Also having primus installed gives a slight improved performance over the default optirun.    

I feel its a win-win situation and the user is well in control. :)     </TEXT>

	<TEXT> yes it will work! :)  

First have a clean install done.  
Next follow the instruction on that page; by installing all the dependencies etc. and the proceed to install bumblebee, bbswitch, bumblebee-nvidia (driver).  
After that reboot the system, login and wait for sometime; it'll compile and load in the background(you can notice this when your fan starts to slow down and system begins to cool).  
If things are working great and you use heavy graphic intensive apps install primus which is listed on the same page  

I can root for bumblebee. I've used it for a long time and its working great a long long time! :)  

I can help you out if you need.

	<TEXT> Is it a dual gpu system, Optimus technology, nvidia+Intel? 
If that's the case you'll need bumblebee.  

Follow this guide for bumblebee, use the proprietary driver for better performance.  
https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Bumblebee  

If it's a normal nvidia card, a package from rpm fusion will certainly do the job.    </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes you can. Mint might include in its default repository.  
I'm not sure where you can download it but perhaps Google will help you out.   
It works great for me on Fedora. Also you might need to create a tiny file to enable sub-pixel rendering(patent blocks to ship by default)  

Edit - i tried a bit of looking around. could find any right links(some key words like libfreetype). Maybe it has a different package name for ubuntu based distros. Perhaps you'll have to stick with infinality(which is really good and more customizable).  </TEXT>

Suggest you to format the disk first to erase everything(Back up using live boot USB if you have anything important on the HD)    
Then let the auto partitioner take care of the job to split up the disk or you can do that your-self if you have the experience.

	<TEXT> Are you still using a usb stick to boot?
If so stop that and boot via the bootloader menu.  
And continue to undo any changes you've made   

Uninstall command:  
sudo dnf autoremove Packagename


The easier way is to definitely reinstall, but you'll have to reinstall all your apps again.  
If you have a speedy connection then that's good


REINSTALL:  
You should get everything back after a clean format and reinstall.  
Remember to make sure of the partition things in windows if this is a dual boot, since there is a strong chance of losing the bootloader.    

Once you completely reinstalled then buzz back here.  
I'lll guide you through installing the driver.

Some things are not a specific standard and supporting things like that will do more harm than good later on.  
Firefox is steadily improving on the html5 adoption as well.

	<TEXT> Great! :)   

Bottom right red is okay, webM needs development.  
The other parameters it's okay if you don't have em, I was reporting from a nightly version so it might not have landed.   
Check for codecs is a nice idea, maybe the team should be notified about it, but I'm not sure how it is going to be.   

Anyway happy YouTubeing!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> alright i hope you are on the latest version of firefox.  

And if you are of the EU region then probably you are missing codecs on the system then you'll need to install windows media player.
