This is a previous question from subreddit vegas.  It is a full-day round trip to Death Valley going west - and it's a great day trip.  I like Zion too - going east - about 3.5 hr drive but less than the Grand Canyon.  Maybe Mt. Charleston - only about 1/2 hr, but not a lot to do once you get there. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> One of my favorite life stories:  We had a welfare rights march in our town in the 70's.  There was another group who organized an anti-welfare march.  A year or so later I was at our local legal services office as a volunteer and I recognized the leader of the anti-welfare march at the office.  He had experienced a heart attack, lost his job, then his wife and his home.  He had no health care, and was seeking legal services.  His life had literally fallen apart.  I remember speaking with him and he regretted the role he had played when fighting these "welfare mothers". </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A couple of points:  I do not believe it is a ponzi scheme; Ponzi schemes run out of investors eventually.  Social security will not; benefits would be reduced first.  It is NECESSARY unless you want to support your parents late in life when they are not able to work.  Finally, I wished I had taken a video of my republican congressman also who also called it a Ponzi scheme at a town meeting.  Republicans don't really want to get rid of social security - they just want to get their greedy hands on it. </TEXT>

The airlines mailed it to her at our hotel so she did get it back before we left town, but most of the money was gone.  She did her ID back though. </TEXT>

Remember that welfare is time limited - maximium 5 years in the US from the welfare reform law passed  during the Clinton administration.  Most welfare recipients are young single mothers, and if not working, are required to attend vocational training or volunteer 20-30 hrs/week.  2-parent households are required to meet a 35 hr/week requirement.  Those unable to work must have a doctor's statements. </TEXT>

It is an interesting story too that I only learned about after reading about it online at UW.  The varsity team couldn't go to the Olympics (i don't remember why), and the JV team took their place.

	<TEXT> No, it is not a ponzi scheme.  Ponzi scheme runs out when there are no more investors.  As long as people continue to pay in to the system, there can always be social security.  Also, they can raise the rates or cut benefits a small amount, but people will continue to be paid.  Also, think about supporting your parents when they are old and unable to work.  Isn't it better that they can remain self-sufficient in their old age?  And how will you feel at that age?   Ready to work until you drop? </TEXT>

Move-on had a great project one year (not sure why they didn't continue it), but I was able to download every voter in my precinct and contact them either by phone or in person.  I am biased and support democrats (at least good ones).  It would be cool to target democrats in republican districts and see if is possible to flip the district.   Also, I noted on a previous comment that I would target medicaid-eligible people also who are unable to sign up for medicaid as their state did not accept medicaid expansion (21 states?).  These people could seriously benefit from voting in their self-interest. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Conspiracies do happen!  I can't address your questions, but I heard a recorded phone call on an old tv show (Investigative Reports I believe) that wowed me - where one mob person told another that the hit was on for JFK.  I was also convinced by Thom Hartmann's book - http://www.amazon.com/Legacy-Secrecy-Long-Shadow-Assassination/dp/1582435359
By the way, I think I found the Investigative Report show also that covered it:  http://www.amazon.com/Investigative-Reports-Jack-Anderson-JFK/dp/B000FKP0TG
A lot of responsible people have said they don't  believe it was a conspiracy, but it would be hard to convince me otherwise. </TEXT>

You can believe what you want, but I think it has been pretty much accepted for fact.  And the idea of a small government.  We fought a war over "states' rights", and the confedercy lost.  The original Articles of Confederation failed also.  Good try, but you can't convince me on either topic. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It doesn't matter what links I could put forth - we see the world from two different frames.  I know that you know that democrats became republicans after Jim Crow - part of the well-known southern strategy.  And I personally believe that voter ID laws are an attempt to restrict minority voting.  And there are a lot of people who believe this or the republican party would not be 90% white, or that Romney would get more than 4% of the minority vote.  
The whole concept of limited government is bizarre to me.  It is my belief that the Articles of Confederation failed because they didn't give the federal government enough power to function.  We also fought a civil war over states rights, and the South lost!  Can't we just let the issue die and get on with it??!!!  Sorry about the 18 day response - I don't check this area of reddit frequently enough...I do appreciate your response though. </TEXT>

I think if I would have worked out more when I was young and never dieted, I wouldn't weigh what I do today.  I don't know if that makes sense, but that is how I feel.  It is also a lot of work and takes more time than I want to spend on the topic.  I do know I would feel better though. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Why do fiscal conservatives vote republican anyway?  They say they are fiscally sound, but if you look at it historically, they are not.  They spend it different ways - mostly for military, and usually end up with a lot of ripoffs due to deregulation.  Reagan is a prime example. Cut taxes, expand the military, deregulate (which killed Savings and Loans and created a huge ripoff of HUD which cost billions.))  Democrats at least have a plan for pay for what they spend and try to monitor spending.  They also realize that peoples rising boat lifts the whole society. </TEXT>

That being said, there is probably room for a smart handicapper.  The ones that publish in the paper have always sucked.
