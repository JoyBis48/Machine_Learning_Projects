	<TEXT> One strategy is to not waste attacks and get VP you don't need - pick and choose high loot bases to attack, and avoid NPC bases if possible (might not be possible at the start though). Another one is to attack everything all the time - you'll lose half of your loot to your bases being attacked, but this might be the more fun way to play the game. 

And if you do join a Task Force, please for the love of Dog, join in and attack as frequently as possible. Nearly half of the people in my TF don't attack most ops, and get free loot (although some do contribute intel, so not entirely freeloaders) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't think the pedestrian auto braking would have worked anyway if the driver had his foot on the accelerator (all of these auto braking systems allow the driver to override it if they choose to). </TEXT>
