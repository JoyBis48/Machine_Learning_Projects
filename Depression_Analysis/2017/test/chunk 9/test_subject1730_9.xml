	<TEXT> Even if the CSS is implemented to make is no participation, it's easy to turn that off. And since this sub has very light CSS, it's not really going to change much other than the header and flair. All you need is RES and you can disable the subreddit style and bam. No more issue with the no participation mode. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Today marks three years of sobriety for me. It's not been an easy journey. I started in AA but never really jumped into the program. I mostly talked to people. That helped me more than I thought it would. At first, I just listened. I didn't really feel like I belonged. ***I*** didn't have a problem with alcohol. ***I*** wasn't like these people here. But as time went on, I kept going to meetings. At one point I was gifted a copy of the big book. I've still got it, but haven't read it all that much. Mostly I just listened. And as time went on, I started to identify with a bit from this person or something from that person. I started to see similarities in me. I remember when it all clicked. On that day, I stood up and said "Hi. I'm Brent, and I'm an alcoholic." On that day, I chose to give up drinking completely. Three years later and I haven't had a drop of alcohol. Oh, I've been tempted so much over that time. I thought time would diminish the urge and desire to drink and it has... to a point. But I have had days where I wanted to do nothing more than drown my sorrows in a bottle. And those days happen more than I would like. To quote the big book: 
 Remember that we deal with alcohol, cunning, baffling, powerful.

I know I'm tempted nearly every day. But I've made it this far. You can too. </TEXT>
