	<TEXT> I think anthropology is a wonderful discipline, but I got into the field knowing it was not a moneymaker and jobs were hard to come by. However, I do know a couple single moms who are badass archaeologists. 

Anthropology is very complimentary with many other fields, including business and sales, because of how it teaches people to better understand other people. Perhaps you could minor in Anthro and use it to complement something else that you would enjoy if you are worried about employability. 

If all else fails, many states and cities in the US have archaeology societies that welcome avocational (people without degrees) and professional archaeologists alike. These groups have regular meetings and presentations and often organize volunteer excavations. Perhaps finding a group like this in your area can even help you with your decision. If you're in the southeast, PM me for some leads on these groups. 

Best of luck! It's a hard road, but if you know what you are getting into it can be a rewarding journey. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> People are people.

I am a museum educator at a Mississippian site in the US, and children ask me all the time things like "Why are they dressed like that?" I usually turn it around and ask them, "Well why did you choose that shirt today?" And then their little brains go "oooooh," and we get one step closer to cultural empathy.  </TEXT>

One of the castmembers at the Fiesta de Jardin booth at the Flower and Garden festival was commenting how the 1st anniversary should be extra special and gave us an extra flan. I think it helped that we were talking in spanish! :) I loved having everyone wish us a happy anniversary. :) </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Star Wars Galactic Dine-In Breakfast Report (x-posted from r/WaltDisneyWorld) </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> We had an awesome time!! The character interaction was wonderful (I have to say though I think it depends on how into it the guest is- you gotta give them something to work with people!), the food was AMAZING, and the atmosphere was spectacular (Sci Fi Dine-In).

We arrived for our 8:25 reservation with a few minutes to spare, checked in, and mingled with other guests while we waited to join the rebellion. Once your rebel cell is called, you join the line to meet [Darth Vader and Boba Fett](http://i.imgur.com/1mcxNdb.jpg). As you can guess from my outfit, I was not too popular with them! Fett liked my boyfriends' shirt though of course. Boba scanned me with his helmet eyepiece and tried to collect my bounty. He was also not impressed by my ears! Darth Vader went as far as taking my Chewbacca plushie, holding it up for the crowd to see, then turning back towards me and slowly and deliberate wringing his neck before dropping him on the floor while staring directly at me. Evil!

After you get your picture taken, the cast member hands each person a mini Lightsaber that can go either red or blue depending on which side you are on. At the table, (which are little cars from the 50's) you get your menu and the server goes to get your pastry starter. A pastry tray, fruit, beverage, and entree are all included in one price. The [pastry tray](http://i.imgur.com/wBRwqgi.jpg) had chocolate muffins, puff pastry Lightsaber sticks with red or blue sugar, Darth Vader Danish things and Princess Leia sticky buns. All delicious!
The fruit salad or parfait that you get next has a little melon Yoda on the top. The entrees all have cute Star Wars names, but the only one that looks special are the [Vader waffles](http://i.imgur.com/QG1TZyu.jpg) which were amazingly delicious! I washed everything down with a blue milk (kinda blue raspberry flavored). The cast member who checked us in at our hotel mentioned we could keep ordering as many entrees as we wanted, but we found that one entree was plenty of food.

The screen at Sci Fi was playing Star Wars clips the entire time and whenever the cantina band music came on, the jawas and Stormtroopers all danced. [I traded with the Jawas](http://i.imgur.com/3VKH1zS.jpg] (they swindled me!), convinced the [Storm Troopers](http://i.imgur.com/yAGUrPJ.jpg) we were not the diners they were looking for, and [apologized to Greedo](http://i.imgur.com/qBpxvVp.jpg) for the incident in Mos Eisley so he would take a picture with me. When we left, Boba Fett almost followed me out the door to make sure I left. All in all, it was an amazing experience that I am so glad we were able to do. </TEXT>
