	<TEXT> For the life of me I could not understand why the police just told the guy they suspected him of a crime. That would have forced him to identify himself. Also they did meet the burden for arresting him. They had testimony that a woman reported him of stalking her, a crime. They just knew he didn't do it and didn't want to go through the paperwork. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The link you refer to compares Obama to different Republican candidates. In your link, if you go down to the Democratic Candidates heading and click that link, and sort to a Broad Race, you will find that Obama was polling about 20-25% in June 2007.

The percentages you refer to Sanders polling in are open Democratic primary races. The above link I referenced is the closest comparison.

While I agree it is highly unlikely Sanders will win, your comparison was not referencing the same type of polling for Obama in June 2007 and Sanders in June 2015. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is not a legal issue. I am not familiar with Australian law, but there is almost no likelihood that they are required to rent out to someone under 18.

This leaves you with only the option of finding someone you know there to let you stay with them, or find a company that will let you rent from them at 17 (highly unlikely).

Another possibility is catching a flight there the day of the game, attending the game, and flying home immediately after. </TEXT>

See if you need to sign up to be a speaker and explain the situation. The more neighbors who will come with you, the better. If it were me, I would suggest to the city council that maybe a motion-activated flood light could be installed, facing away from the houses, but I'm not sure if that is practical. Further, making sure these two are prosecuted each time they break the law and suffer a higher punishment each time could be a suggestion, but that would only help if the possible punishment includes jail time. For the break ins, you could look into having a security camera point at your driveway. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A good LSAT score is essential for you. You don't have a great GPA but you don't have a crap one. One point about the LSAT is to give yourself time to take it at least 2 times, if not 3. Since you're taking a year off that means your last one should be December 2016, 2nd to last October 2016, and first one June 2016. You have plenty of time to learn so you should begin reading some of the Bibles and maybe take an LSAT class.

Also for your gap year, try to find a job that is law related. It can only help your application and give you a perspective on if you want to be doing that for the next 40 years of your life. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As a 17 year old, who won't be at the same school his girlfriend until after the first year of college, I can say with 99.99% accuracy that it won't last the rest of your lives. And there's nothing wrong with that. Everyone has young relationships where they are head over heels for each other and think life is just the best ever. But people grow up and change. As much as you may not want to hear it, you will change a LOT over the next 2, 4, 10 years.

My advice would be to enjoy the time you have with her. Be happy, let her be happy and just go with life. This is one of the last times in your life where you have next to no responsibility, so just go with the flow.

Your college plans sound like one of you is a year older and have plans to join the other at college after the first year. Is that right? If so, I can almost guarantee the relationship won't last. I'm not trying to sound mean. It's just long distance is hard. And even if by some miracle you were in the same city, it would ruin the first year of college where you should be making all sorts of friends and getting into schenanigans and going to your first parties while living on your own.

Assuming you're the one leaving for college and she's a year behind, I would say you should enjoy the time you have, but when you're about to leave just let her down gently. Be nice and tell her there's a whole world out there and if she still wants to pursue a relationship in another year when you're both a little older and have more life experience, you'd be glad to try.

Best of luck, man. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> He certainly did. At 23, Holloway is starting to show some serious game. Punches were on point, subs were on point. I'd like to see him become a little more comfortable with wrestling and clinch but he's coming into his own.

I just worry about them throwing him to the top too fast. With Aldo/McG coming up, Holloway likely only has one more fight before a title shot. But he should take at least another year or so to continue improving. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This whole thing about "family" is crap. Would you not report any child molester to the police?

If I were you, the absolute next thing I would do after reading this comment is to immediately call the police. You can call 24/7. You can call the non-emergency line.

These girls lives are likely to be severely impacted because of this. You were who they confided in so YOU have a responsibility. Your uncle doesn't want the cops called on his dad? Tough crap dude. Maybe he shouldn't have molested children. If someone in your family murdered someone, would you not call the cops?

Come on man, get your head in the game. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Fun Fact: Holloway fought four times last year and is already fighting for the second time this year and it's only mid-April. If he ends up with four fights in 2015, I believe he'd have the record for most fights in a 2 year period (8, tied with Cerrone (twice)). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well then 4(b) applies.

But my point is that by posting this or telling others you'll vote 3rd party, you are possibly convincing others, who are convincing others, etc. So by then, if you go "oh now it's a swing state so I'll vote Hillary" then it doesn't matter at that point.

You doubt New Jersey will EVER be a swing state? Texas was blue not that long ago. NJ was red 27 years ago. </TEXT>
