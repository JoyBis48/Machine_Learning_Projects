	<TEXT> So Friday after work I got on the bus it was an earlier one because I got out of work early, anyways I get on and see this nice brown haired girl talking to some old guy they chat for a few stops then santa claus leaves and I think "I should ask her for her number" literally as I am about to get up and talk to her some other older guy starts chatting with her!!!!! I am so pissed why is he talking to her he is like 60 and she is like 22. I hear her give him her number and he gets off the bus I am about to finally make my move but then the bus stops and she gets off too!!!! I was tempted to follow her but it didnt happen I was so cheesed off LOL. I will ride that same bus again soon and see if she is on there I think I overheard her say she was going to work. Just wanted to say that and stuff.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So last night I went to a strip club for the first time ever!!!!! I was bored and theres one I always see close to my house I go there and I am completely overwhelemned!!!! So many HOTTIES half naked!!!! Anyways after a few drinks and at least 25 dollar bills tipped I asked this really HOT dancer named Jordan for a private dance in the VIP room, it was 20 dollars to get in and then 20 per song. We go in the back and she immedietely grabbed me in the crotch (keep in mind too that I was very drunk by this time LOL). She danced all over me and I felt her EVERYWHERE!!!!! I am still trying to remember all of the positions she was in LOL, we talked about random stuff too like her job and my job a few other things. She had this awesome tattoo on her back too like angel wings a few others too. She danced for 3 songs so it was 60 dollars (I got a raise at work recently thats why I treated myself I was gonna buy a PS4 but did this instead LOL) I was so tempted to go back there today and get another one from that sexy goddess but I couldnt really afford it. I will return there again though and get 3 more songs from that beauty!!!!! I remember carrying her briefly with her legs wrapped around me that was nice. I just had to tell someone this since I dont want to tell my family and all of my friends seem to never answer my texts anymore LOL, oh man I can still feel her grip on my crotch.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So a few years ago I was at a party at my friends house and one of his friends Rachel invited a whole bunch of her friends and we all got wasted or at least buzzed I remember this girl I met Justine she showed an interest in me and all of my buds were telling me I should make a move on her I did and we started making out on the couch I actually thought I was going to get laid but then her friend said she was leaving and she left but she gave me one last kiss on the cheek and said "I have a boyfriend". I was a little upset cause she just used me but I also wish I could see her again I never saw her again except one time on the train when I was going to work I waved at her but she pretended not to notice me. Anyways sometimes I look up her FB profile to see what she is up to, she never accepted my request either. I just wanted to make this known.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I always get a large Soda and Large Popcorn along with Red Vines although it is not always Red Vines sometimes I will try something else but yeah I am like you if I am in a cinema and I dont have something to munch on throughout the movie then I feel weird, I have actually gone to great lengths to get a snack for a movie. Also at certain theaters that I go to I usually order some cheese sticks man those are freakin delicious!!!!  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> I see double all the time </TITLE>

	<TEXT> So as far as I can remember I see double whenever something is up close like my finger or a pencil I know a normal person would see something in front of their face that is just single but I see it as double all the time no matter how far away it is. For example is someone puts their hand in front of my face I would see two hands and a normal person would see only one. What is wrong with my eyes?? I am 22 years old and 6 foot and 2 inches.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would give Hulk a sequel in phase two and have Ed Norton be Banner in all films. I would also switch Antman so it is released before Avengers Ultron so Antman can appear in the sequel also make Pym the creator of Ultron of course.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The best theater experience I have ever had was probably The Avengers. I remember rushing to the theater after work that day and waiting in line for an hour I get in the theater and choose probably the best seat in that stadium like theater. It was so packed and as the movie went on I loved it, I remember when Coulson died I jumped and some lady behind me shouted "Damit Joss". Also the Puny God moment I dont think I have heard a laugh like that in a theater in so long LOL!!!! I wish I could relive that day again.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I assume because it is not too long for production and it only takes a few months, that way they can reach their mark of yearly and stuff. I kinda wonder what it would be like if they released them 20 episodes at a time.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would have said that instead of Killing Jury he just cuts ties with the indian hills charter due to his anger, and lets say Unser calls the cops before jax gets to the house so she is locked up and jax is deprived of his revenge but he does get to kill Marks and Barofsky just not publicly and so Gemma spends the rest of her life in prison on death row never sees jax or the boys again and Jax finally leads the club into a legit direction.
