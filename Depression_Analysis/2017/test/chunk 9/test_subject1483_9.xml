	<TEXT> Black Flag is the only game I think they did right apart from the first 2. For me it is the one that looks most different to the other and therefor gives it a different feel. 


At the beginning of Assassins Creed I was really excited for the series. Imaging every game would be set in a completely different time period and country (i.e Egypt during the reigns of the Pharaohs, China during the Ming Dynasty, England during the Industrial Revolution, America during the Revolution etc etc) but every game from Assassins creed 1-3 felt the same. They took too long to realise the potential of the series.


Also on another note, wtf is up with Abstergo Entertainment?? I hope it really hasn't come to that, I hop I have to take them down in the end (Haven't finished the game yet). </TEXT>

Now though since it wasn't included in the last game they are more likely to not have the option again in this game. Match customization was a big part of the game for my friends and I so I apologise but I fell quite strongly since the WWE games have been a part of my life since forever. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's just you're trying to defend a game which is blatantly bad. The only thing that game has going for it is the gun control, that's it. The rest of is is a grind with very little content to keep you engaged. I was as excited as the next guy for that game to come out, and as disappointed as the rest when it did. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was hoping for the AC series to be completely different. i.e what they hinted in the first game in Desmond's room. I though each game would be set in a different time period in different parts of the world, granted it technically was but they all felt the same. I was hoping for one in China during the Ming dynasty, another in Egypt during the time of the Ferros etc etc. Instead we got the crap that they spewed out Abstergo Entertainment **FUCK OFF** </TEXT>
