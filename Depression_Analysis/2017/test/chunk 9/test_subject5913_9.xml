	<TEXT> I plan on moving to SLC, in a few months, but need to take care of things. Like, getting a job and an apartment. But I don't want to get a job without have my own transportation. I'm 21 and I don't know how to drive, nor do I have my license. This is causing me a lot of anguish, because I lived the past three years in NJ without a car, so walking to school was a nightmare, especially during the winter.  I'm tired of walking everywhere or having to spend money on cabs, or rely on people for rides. I don't know anyone in SLC, so I definitely can't rely on anyone for a ride. 
Is learning to drive expensive? And since I'm 21, would I still have to drive six months with someone older than 25 before I can get a real license? That was a law in NJ. I'm not sure if it's the same over here.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Maybe sometime in the future, but as of right now, no. I like to move on to other illustrations. Like I said, this was a study. I'm not the most masterful painter in the world, nor do I have a ton of experience under my belt. I've never been the best at capturing likenesses, but this is a much better improvement that I've seen in my work. I definitely could not paint this well, three years ago.  </TEXT>
