	<TEXT>  It'd be one thing if women in the publishing industry were legitimately discriminated against, meaning, if a man and woman with the same manuscript were to walk in, the man would get chosen.

-----

In this case, women make up less than 50% of the industry, yet if a man and woman walk in with the same credentials, the woman will be chosen.

Can you really not even see your own inconsistencies and biases? Your "information on the admissions standards of an industry" is just some random thing you claimed to read on reddit. I think we're done here.

This isn't magical fairy land, the author must know there is no chance of what she suggests gaining any kind of traction. *Winds of Winter* is finally done? Sorry George, no men this year! 

All this does is give opponents of the issue an easy target, angers an entire gender where a good amount are on your side, and doesn't help further progress on the actual issue at all. Boo this woman! </TEXT>

Birth control policies are still backwards and woman are losing legislative ground. Violence against woman is a huge problem almost everywhere, and we can make strides to protect women better. Many portrayals of woman in the media are still harmful. The disproportionate amount of woman in STEM fields... this is just barely touching on the hotbed issues.

	<TEXT> **The Third Bear** by Jeff Vandermeer and **North American Lake Monsters** by Nathan Ballingrud are both fantastic collections of weird/horror/fantasy short stories. Vandermeer is most well known for the Southern Reach trilogy but I feel like this book is actually his best work.

**Eyes of the Dragon** by Stephen King is also very good - if you really want to be picky, it has loose connections to the Dark Tower, but is very much a stand alone book. Much closer to traditional fantasy than the short story collections as well. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This site is pretty bad and buggy.

- Very slow. Lots of bugs and mislabeled entries for books.

- Lacking many obscure and non mainstream books. The site doesn't even have an entry for *The Goldfinch* (or if it does, it's totally buried), which won a Pulitzer in 2014...come on.

- Seems to recommend the same books to everyone - Hope you like *Maus* and *The Far Side*, this site sure does!

I don't understand why I see this linked all of the time in this sub, Goodreads is miles better. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> People love to bring up Lovecraft whenever a bigoted author is mentioned,  but they are just not the same. Lovecraft was raised during the nadir of American race relations,  the worst era of racism after the civil war.  His racism should not be ignored, but it should be judged according to the times in which he wrote his books.

Card actively campaigns against gay rights and has no excuse for his warped, hateful views in today's society.  </TEXT>

I know personally this is the case for me. If someone like Card wrote something I wanted to read, I'd still read it, just find a way to do so where I'm not monetarily supporting the author... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hp lovecraft isn't comparable to card. Lovecraft's racism is awful, but also a testament to the times it was written. Card has no such excuse, and is not only a homophobe, but one actively involved in bringing his stance to the public.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The book is smart and funny. It mixes social satire, black comedy, and slasher horror films effortlessly. It's deeply layered and has commentary ranging from the obvious in capitalist corporate culture, to the more subtle in things like the AIDS scare in the eighties. I think it's one of the best books written in the past 30 years. </TEXT>
