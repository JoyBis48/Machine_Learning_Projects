[Ignore the person bitching about the service there, they are a whinny little shit](http://mobile.yp.ca/bus/Alberta/Rocky-View-County/Balzac-Meats/1777482.html)

The place is definitely not run by Walmart greeters, they are oldschool farm folk. Best fucking steak you'll ever eat.

Anyway, the first song I put on was leathers, and the girl behind the bar mistook the silence at the beginning as a volume issue and cranked the speakers to the fucking max. All of us, including myself almost had heart attacks together. What a laugh. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Woah, thank you. I feel I am a pretty driven person, and that hard work is always worth the effort. Although, as I've mentioned I plan on utilizing these skills more towards photography, and not so much as a designer. I aim to be a well rounded person, and feel the skills learned with this would go a long way with what I want to achieve.

As for the "industry hacks" you've mentioned, I believe they exist in every trade, lord knows they did/do in my current industry (aircraft repair). I still managed to push through and maintain a valuable career all the same. But as it's a dying industry, and the thought of losing my job is taxing on my mind, I feel it's time to make change. There's no better time than now, as they say. Thanks again for your input. </TEXT>

Having said that, I will definitely take you seriously and will attempt to put something together. I should mention, I currently use a Rebel XSI, something I purchased in 2008, the camera that really sparked by attention. I am currently in the market for the Mark III, but am weighing my options against the Nikon 810A, I may wait it out for the new Canon line and focus on my education. Until then however, I feel I would be better represented by more experience with better equipment. Let me know what you think, and thanks. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I do consider myself artistic, and I love digital photography. I would love nothing more than to work for myself someday. I would love to be fluent in graphic design, and be able to edit photos with ease, as time is money. This is a place I've always thought I belonged, but have chosen technical trades instead, as time goes by, I feel it's time for change.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am looking to get into wedding photography, and wanted to further my editing skills. So I wouldn't go as far to say graphic design as a career, but I think the tools offered by this course would greatly enable my ability. Thank you very much for you input. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Was wondering if anyone here had gone through the [graphic design course at SAIT](http://www.sait.ca/programs-and-courses/continuing-education/courses-and-certificates/graphic-design-certificate-of-achievement.php), and if so did you think it was worth it? 

I want to make sure it's not just a bunch of outdated videos, and is actually a valuable experience. Thanks in advance. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you very much for your insight and kind words. I wouldn't deny the fact that abnormal myelination could be a hard thing to see outside a trained eye. Maybe I've watched too many episodes of house, and have always pictured a diagnosis like this to be broken down in a very basic visual presentation. I just want to see it for myself, and have explained to me what I'm seeing. I'd love nothing more than to compare my son's MRI with a "healthy" one.

We already have an appointment with another neurologist, and as he's a colleague of our current doctor I'm hoping for an unbiased assessment. Only time will tell at this point. Thanks again. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> First time poster in this sub, but seemed to be the most relevant place for my inquiry. Question regarding myelin and MRI's inside. </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Recently my wife and I have been told by a neurologist our son (2.5years old) may have a condition known as [pelizaeus merzbacher disease](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/PelizaeusMerzbacher_disease). Based on his early development of nystagmus, current state of ataxia, and apparent low myelin formation on his MRI. As you can imagine we are taken back by this, especially while we wait for confirmation through genetic testing.

I've asked the doctor to please show us his MRI, and she has avoided this for almost two months now. Everytime I bring it up it seems she avoids it, explaining it would be of no use to us as "it's incredibly hard to spot". No matter how much I insist, we never get a chance to examine our son's MRI. So my question is this, how hard is it to actually see low myelin formation? Should I be concerned with how the neurologist is handling this? We are very scared, and it seems no one has any answers. I should mention I do not have a background in medicin, just an average blue collar worker.

Thank you very much.  </TEXT>
