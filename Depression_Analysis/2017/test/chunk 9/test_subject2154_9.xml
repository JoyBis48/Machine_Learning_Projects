	<TEXT> "The data generally suggests the role of clutch hitting is limited if it exists at all" did you read that part? Certainly seems to be at least strongly hinting that clutch isn't a thing.

The one quote that I think says what you're saying it says is the second one. Which I've agreed with this whole time. I'm more than willing to believe in clutch, if the evidence is there. I'd even like to believe in clutch. But thus far, the evidence has suggested that there is no consistent trend of clutchness even within a season, much less over multiple seasons. See the studies that were cited at the beginning of the article.

The reason they are saying there is no such thing as a clutch hitter is because it is nigh upon impossible to definitively prove that something does not exist. They have not proved that there is no such thing as clutch, but they certainly haven't proven that it does exist.

Which doesn't really square with your final point, that "there's no way [I] can't tell [you] guys like Jeter or Arod haven't been consistently clutch throughout their careers". That's exactly what I'm saying. Those guys haven't been consistently clutch throughout their careers. Their performances in high-leverage situations are within the expected variances from their career averages in all situations. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm being pedantic? You have given literally zero evidence that such a phenomenon exists, other than cherrypicked anecdotes...which I suppose puts you on the cutting edge of clutch apologists, so congrats on that.

	<TEXT> Seriously, this trade was a steal as soon as it was made. Two young pitchers with upside and years of team control remaining for an outfielder whose career OBP was under .300 at the time of the deal, and has only one plus tool (power). It's only going to look better as time goes on.

For a nice evaluation of Trumbo currently, look at the return the Dbacks got for him from Seattle. He went over with Vidal Nuno (a decently-high-upside long reliever), and back came Welington Castillo (a catcher who had only gotten 25 ABs), Dominic Leone (a relief pitcher who was good last year but had an ERA over 6 for Seattle), and two minor leaguers who project as a maybe-everyday-player and a utility player.

Would you trade Santiago and Skaggs for a backup catcher with no bat, a struggling reliever, and two decent AA guys? I hope not. We killed it in this trade. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There's people in the college game who we look at as physical monsters, who are able to assert absolute physical dominance at the college level, simply because they are upperclassmen who are grown ass men now. Not very many of these guys make an impact in the NBA; much of their effectiveness in college is in their physicality.

Now take someone who's actually good enough to be in the NBA, and is a contributor, and on top of that is fully mature physically, and works out for a living.

95% of NBA starters would be able to drag an awful team to the tournament. If they land on a team like Seattle or Florida Gulf Coast, as was suggested, they'd be in title contention. I love college hoops, but there's some serious overestimation of the college game in here right now. </TEXT>

We live in a society that systemically favors men over women, dude. A lot of people couch this distinction in terms that makes it seem like you have no struggles because you're male, which is wrong.

But what is true is that there are a set of challenges you will never have to face or even potentially face, because you are a man and not a woman. That's what privilege is. </TEXT>

He's always had really high standards for catcher defense, and is unlikely to play a guy who's good offensively but mediocre defensively. Nap was a great offensive catcher, but not a strong defender, so Sosh always hesitated to give him too much playing time. That's why we dealt him, and he's bit us in the ass at every turn since. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I take the other view. Hopefully, when a woman makes it to the majors and gets her first hit, that's only the start of a wave of women who can play. No downside to be had here. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think I can get on board with could use improvement. I'm personally a big fan of teams that play like that too. I think Sosh is capable of that, but he could do better for sure. He tends to be a hands-off guy, and when the players are fun guys, he lets them be them. I think the team is kinda pressing under expectations right now; we'll see how Sosh responds to that, what buttons he pushes. Here's hoping! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think I probably used wording that was a bit too strong when I said "to a T". I also think you make a good point regarding his hesitancy to give young guys at bats; if I had anything to change about his style, it would be that. But I also think he deserves credit for working guys like Kole into the lineup quickly.

Ultimately, I spoke a little too strongly about his team management. I do believe that he does a good job getting out of the way of the team, and promoting an atmosphere that allows them to handle the clubhouse as they see fit. Lately, we've had players on our roster who prefer to go about their business individually, and we've seen that on the roster. But it's been far from a toxic environment. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A good number of the movies you listed are based on books. *Fight Club*, *Into the Wild*, *Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas*, *American Psycho*, *One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest*. Check out those books, or other works by the authors who wrote them. Can't be a bad place to start, there's some real good ones in there. </TEXT>
