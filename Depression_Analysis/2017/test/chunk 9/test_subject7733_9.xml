	<TEXT> There's nothing glaring really. There's just a lot of money and incentives for scientists to prove their points right. Ridley talks about this one graph (forgive me for forgetting the minutia)  that was influential in climate science. In this graph there was a set of points that were in the graph inappropriately to skew the way people interpreted. They did it knowingly. Ridley found this out and removed the false data and it wasn't as scary as once made to believe. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Aright I'm doing this from my phone so bear with me though typos and formatting.

First off, I don't think using Wikipedia as your main source of argument isn't that damning, but I entertained it. Wiki says, "usually by not slowing police or municipal employees to inquire about an individual's immigration status." That's fine, I understand why they wouldn't. 

However, the article referenced in [Ref 1](sfgate.com/bayarea/article/newsom-says-s-f-won-t-help-with-raids-mayor-2600450.php) says Mayor pledges to discourage Feds' immigration sweeps. Essentially, he will do nothing to stop illegals from wanting to come to his city. They are illegal immigrants and actively defying US law by residing here without proper citizenship.

In my eyes when you defend sanctuary cities like this, you are endorsing illegal immigration.

You can begin to cut murder/violent crime rates by removing illegals. Having illegals certainly won't increase the crime rate! It's a crime to even be here. If you think illegals keep the crime rate down because of all the vigilante-like crime reporting they're doing then I'd love to see that source.

You can also argue they want a better life and I empathize with them on that. I think US needs to do something about it with out Mexico relations. Shame on them for turning a blind eye and complete unwillingness to help out their own citizens. The Mexican government is smuggling their drug lords out of jail and refusing to extradite them to America where they can be convicted and proven guilty without a doubt.

In SF, it is a get out of jail free card. It just is. It's not even about inquiring about every single Latino person, it's that they are actively inviting laws to be broken. 

I have nothing against Latinos. I have a problem with breaking US laws whether you be white, black, yellow, green, or any other sort of color.

Deportations have dropped by 35% in SF in the past 3 years and in the USA alone it has been the lowest number in over 40 years. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Here's how I feel about the whole climate debate. Matt Ridley actually has a lot of views I like. He's more of a climate lukewarmer. I think humans are affecting the environment negatively, however, I think politicians and powerful people are exaggerating the immediate effects of it. 

Matt Ridley has studied this extensively and has called bullshit on a lot of popular things that climatologists point to as "evidence". I recommend listening to the podcast EconTalk that features him. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Common practice for most large cities? Not true. They don't turn you over to immigration in San Francisco. That illegal immigrant that killed that American was arrested twice and released from jail in America. In what world do you live in that you want people illegally invading our country? Liberals preach about the wage gap yet support illegal immigration. It just fuels their arguments and it's bull shit. </TEXT>

Lucky for you though, because you have over a year to make an informed decision. Since the primaries haven't begun yet, you're in good shape. Listen to debates as they happen, find positives and negatives about each candidate before you decide. Don't judge the candidates based on their media perspective. Judge them primarily by their actions. Words are usually empty promises. See what they have actually done or tried as a judge of their character. </TEXT>

So. My point is. I don't believe in 9/11 conspiracies but that could be viewed as a false flag operation. Basically, we planned the attacks to invade the middle east for oil and $$$. So the people in power were positively effected by this, people could argue. </TEXT>

You can say that these talks are just about nukes, but holy hell, I'll be damned if you ever hear about these hostages for a while. They are AMERICANS being held against their will without committing any crimes as far as I know. This is unjust and I can't believe this isn't even a topic of discussion. Since when does America back down from protecting its citizens? Since when does America not ensure to its people that they won't be prosecuted without reason? Unbelievable, this a joke.


EDIT: Being downvoted for caring about the American people. Suits reddit. Over zealous it may be, but damn, I just want to hear anything from this administration. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Forget the immense length of The Wall, and no songs had to be taken out in order to have a longer CN. Would you still keep it the same? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah I said to my friend once that I wish the solo was longer since I could hear the fade out. He's like dude, go listen to the Pulse version NOW </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My question can be simplified. Would you rather have Comfortably Numb from The Wall to have that really long emotional solo that features in Pulse or not? I've been listening to the Pulse version a lot lately and wonder how it would sound on The Wall, you could also argue that hearing the long solo version live for the first time was so much more impactful. I don't know. What're your guy's thoughts? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Simple solution to help with Riot's community communication issue. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-07-07 22:55:47 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I think this is a simple solution, so I will keep it brief. A lot of people have issues with Riot's transparency or unwillingness to keep us updated on promises made long ago. What if each developer team would produce a weekly update/blurb about what they were working on and how it was going. It wouldn't have to be much. For instance, while working on the death recap (Finally btw) have the team say, ran into issue X, Y, or Z still figuring it out or something. I'm not sure, I just feel like if the community had updates, they wouldn't feel so left out at times. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm a constitutional libertarian and still in college so I don't fall in the old conservative stigmatism. And I can honestly say that reddit being liberal by majority (not sure if that's true; vocal minority effect) is really annoying to me. I'm friends with liberals without much issues, but the anonymity of the Internet gives these people a megaphone and a rooftop. I'm not trying to call everyone out, but it's just the way I perceive it. I'm also a spiteful person so I'm looking forward to all the Bernie Sanders supporters to have their hearts broken at their delusional expectations. However, there are many Sanders supporters with reasonable expectations and are hopeful in a rational way. But when I see everyone vote brigading every time he takes a shit, it's really annoying. I also find solace in knowing that if he's labeled a Socialist (which he is) not many conservatives will vote for him.


Sorry about this bitter post and it felt good to get it off my chest honestly. If anyone is willing to have a normal peaceful conversation/debate that's fine by me. </TEXT>
