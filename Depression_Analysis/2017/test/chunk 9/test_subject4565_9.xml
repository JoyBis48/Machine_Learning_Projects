	<TEXT>  No, you point was that you are equating an action with intent to the same as a negligent action, which are two very separate acts.

You're gonna tell me what my own point was? I just told you what my point was. A police K9 is a police officer regardless of circumstances. That is my point. Whether negligent or intentional, regardless of **who** injures the dog, it should be considered an **officer** uniformly in all cases. Do you have anything to say about that point? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In one scenario a person willfully kills the animal while attempting to run from police.

Willfully kills the animal while attempting to run? That statement is an oxymoron. How can they willfully kill the animal while they are attempting to run away?

My point is that if a police K-9 is going to be considered "an officer", and criminals who harm said "officer" are charged the same as if they had harmed an actual police officer, than the same "officer" status should stand regardless of the circumstances.

The dog is an officer, so while the death may not have been intentional, it was caused by negligence and the police officer responsible should be charged accordingly as if the dog was a person who was unintentionally locked in the car and died. 

Enough with this double standard bullshit. The only thing asinine here is your lame analogy. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Definitely cut down on the nicotine level and see if you notice a difference. When i say sweating, I was dripping and it felt like my skin was radiating heat like it was some sort of super power. 

What many people don't realize is how much nicotine they are actually ingesting when using an e-cig, because they tend to puff on it much more casually and often than if they were smoking regular cigarettes. Not to mention that the filter in a regular cigarette does a lot to restrict the level of nicotine, tar, and other chemicals that make it into your lungs. 

Ever smoke a regular cigarette with no filter? Notice the difference and how easily it makes you light headed? I postulate that smoking an e-cig is not much different in terms of nicotine consumption, it's like smoking a cigarette unfiltered, (only without the tobacco and all the other harmful chemicals/carcinogens). </TEXT>

I experienced symptoms of what i think is a nicotine overdose where I became very dizzy, slightly nauseous, and I was sweating while my skin was basically radiating heat. Had to lie down on my bed for a bit and let it pass. That's about the time I switched to 3mg juice. </TEXT>

Not the best decision... for me, the trip will usually last about 8-12 hours depending on the potency and dosage (as each tab will have a different amt of actual LSD on it).

Very much a rookie mistake, if I were you, I would look into crafting up an excuse to call out of work tomorrow so that you can actually enjoy your trip. Sleeping on LSD has never been too easy for me, not to mention it would be a hell of a waste.

	<TEXT> Bills have stated that they want McCoy to get 300+ carries. Fred Jackson probably won't be stealing too many touches from him.

On the other hand, DeMarco has Ryan Matthews and possibly sometimes Sproles who are willing and able to steal his touches.

Is this rushing yards only, or passing yards included as well?

Either way it is a toss up, but barring injury, as much as I hate to say it, I think Lesean has the advantage here strictly due to his lack of competition for touches.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Beautifully said, thanks for taking the time to write that out. 

All of the energy that existed in that "singularity" pre big bang, had to come for somewhere. I find it difficult to believe that it just infinitely "was". 

Is it possible that all that energy/matter that existed in the pre big bang singularity, was accumulated from somewhere much in the same way black holes absorb the matter/light/energy around them? 

I read somewhere that the ultimate fate of any simply expanding universe is to contain just one black hole which is so massive that it has swallowed up all the other black holes and subsequent matter (of course this would take a very long time), because there is no known "critical mass" for a black hole. 

Perhaps the end result of the universe is when every atom has been swallowed up into a giant black hole, then a critical mass in a sense has been reached and the resulting singularity explodes into another big bang.

And the cycle continues on and on...

	<TEXT> Just the details and the way it's gone down. I've seen it many times in the past. Of course, I don't know you or her personally, that would make the diagnosis much more simple.

But as far as specifics, the sudden nature of it, the fact that you have been together for 4 years and are only 20 years old. Prime breakup time. Also a prime age where you meet a lot of new people. A lot of times it's a guy from work, could be a friend of a friend, probably someone she spends a lot of time around. 

The fact that she is keeping things open ended with you, in my opinion could mean she doesn't know where its going with the other guy, but she is free to do whatever she wants with you or him while she makes up her mind, because she is no longer in an official relationship. The fact that she is still sleeping next to you when she comes over and all that, shows that she still has interest in you, but that she feels guilty about what she's doing with the other guy and as a result doesn't want to take things further. 

What was her legitimate reason for ending things after 4 years? What about your relationship wasn't working out to her liking, that she couldn't handle?

A lot of times they won't tell you about the other guy because either they don't want to hurt your feelings, they don't want you going after the other guy, or they want to string you along on the back-burner, selfishly, in case things don't work out with the other guy. (or a combination of the three)

Either way, having lived through my 20's, it is far more common than you probably realize at this point in your life. It's unfortunate.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> ~~Who ended the relationship?~~ I see that she did. Unfortunately, this re-affirms my previous statement. Sounds like she met somebody else while you were together and was developing feelings for them, didn't want to be disrespectful to you / sneaking around, so she ended things (and left them open ended). Now she may be feeling conflicted, unsure of what she wants. 

I know it sucks, and this could very well not be the case, but I'm just speaking from general experience. Make damn sure though, because you should be keeping your own future and well being in mind. The legitimate reason for the breakup plays a huge role in what your next steps should be. </TEXT>
