	<TEXT> I'm confused when did she build up his career and wealth? this is the problem with self entitled people, if i'm a billionaire and you're some pop star just be quiet. He made his own path, she just married into it, they need to end alimony, it's a stupid concept, only alimony should exist if she helped directly contribute to his well being either in a wife role with actual duties or in a professional role that helped said person accumulate his wealth. Same goes for a man in the stay at home role. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You're incorrect. Number one Germany was never an ethnic designation for a group of people because the concept of a united germany is relatively new, in if you ask germans what is germany they will have a hard time describing it to you because unlike america germans don't have a sense of nationalist or patriotic pride in the sense of a united country outside of who they pay their taxes too. Germany was made up of a whole host of minor principalities from Bavarian to Prussians only recently coalescing into the modern german national identity which went horrible for them so now when it comes to national identities Germans are a paranoid about comparisons to Nazi's nationalism. 

Ditto for italy which was made up of a myriad of smaller city states like florence and regions like Tuscany. Their's not a nation called native america but theirs still a united identity among the various tribal groups no matter how recent, in you're referring to south africa as the country, of course they will say afrcan but i'm looking at the ethnic denotation and cultural not nationality. 

No columbus actually ws not super lost when he decided to name them as such, he did it purposefully to insult the natives, he knew he was not in india, allot of people like to believe in misconceptions and this is one of them. Europe had a general view of what other nations outside of their realm looked like in random tribals on a island was not one of them plus he would of known going the way he went he would of ran into china or another eastern asian country before india. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sorry i should of explained further. When i stated niche market i was referring to the fact hellboy is a lesser known comic even by comic book readers, my first knowledge of hell boy came from the movie even though i am a gamer outside of random merch for hellboy or a comic ad in other comics i never read or had much interest in it. He's in the cult comic book niche market which unlike superman,batman, spiderman and iron or even guardians of the galaxy which relied on the brand name of marvel to get people in the door hell boy unless bought by marvel has no mainstream appeal to sell the movie franchise to moviegoers. 

People will chance right now on any comic book movie made by marvel because they know they loved iron man, they liked avengers and its' a fun time for the family not so much for hell boy, unknown rough around the edges super hero who does not even want to be the hero of mankind. 


Of course not, if i torrent something it's because it's either not available or easy to acquire because trust me torrents are a bitch to download if you have no clue what you're doing, you need like 3 different programs(i won't ay them because of this subreddit probably has some random no torrent list rule) and at-least some basic common sense to figure out non malware torrents which cuts out  a large group of casual consumers who do not even know how to properly upload pics to things outside of fb. The people who torrent are the ones who would never of bought your product anyway, movie and record companies realize this in while it might have effected music industry at one point, it has never effected tv/movies in a really negative way, hbo is a subscription based network with a the most torrented tv show in history and the ceo of the company was like that's dope right? we the shit. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So i just woke up in this is the first thing i see in all i'm thinking is no no no.......... while i'm not familiar with George Coe's other work which i'm sure is exceptional by his woodhouse performance, this is a shocking loss. After the end of futurama, other shows like family guy and south park became unfunny in american dad losing it's edge, archer is my last hope and a part of that had to due with woodhouse, nothing was better then his often forgotten mistreated heroin addicted butler. I'm at a lost for words right now, you will be remembered for the unending laughter you brought into my and every other fan of archer lives.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh stfu. The reality is the movie industry is the worse it's been in 50 years, movie theaters don't even make money off of tickets because the studio's sell the film at such a high price. They make money off of concession stands, the films Hollywood makes are unoriginal cash cows with horrible premises. Add that into the fact streaming is much better then spending nearly 50 or a hundred dollars on a family outing for a crap film in you see while studious lose so much money, that in the fact their advertising is abysmal, they spend millions yet when the movie releases know one has heard of it. Even when the movie makes a profit studios due to some creative accounting do not admit this. 

Movie's like hell boy fell because they're a niche market in a even more niche market(comic book/cult comic book smaller fanbase) which cuts off at-least 60% of your revenue stream. Plus when the sequel is just not that great it's not worth it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> German citizenship is not passed down to people born into germany just for being born there, unlike the us where you can be a foreigner and your kid is naturalized due to the 14th amendment which states all children born on american soil are Americans, in this goes even further where nationality/ethnic background are intertwined, i can't be a german just by being born in germany, just like she is not african just because she was born in a african country, african if you believe in racial classifications is a race, she's caucasian, if you believe in ethnic identity she's a dutch descended boer, only under nationality is she considered not an african but a south african in reference to the name of her country , much like how theirs a country called macedonia but they're not descended from the ancient macedonians.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sovereignty only establishes land ownership by force, the native americans also had sovereignty they just lost due to our willingness to kill them more then they were willing or able to kill us. In of course they have no more claim to a land, if a native american came up to me in said this is my land i would tell him to get stuffed, but the fact remains 300 years ago this was their land, we took it, i have no problem with that. I'm a zionist for god sakes, granted the jews are the native americans in this situation but even if you saw the arabs are the rightful owners of the land when they declared a war and lost, all land ownership claims became null.

In actuality their were a myriad of confederations and tribes that inhabited the entirety of the united states at one point or another, why do you think we fought wars with them? the idea of native americans not laying claim to land is b.s, some tribes were more open to outsiders sure but in general their view was not that the land could not be owned but their belief that certain things like access to wildlife, water, in land to grow food was open to others of course native tribes differed on this, in many went to war when their territory was encroached upon, native americans were not hippies and many tribes would sooner be singing a patriotic this is the motherland song then this land is my land this land is your land b.s </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Despite the fact that this sounds awesome in theory, i mean 5.4 trillion dollar asteroid?!!!!! but in reality much like diamond planets or planets that rain gold, if we ever found one and were able to access the resources it would literally tank the economic value of such resources. This is why diamonds are kept artificially high, in reality diamonds are the least valuable rare gem on our planet, it's theorized we have enough for a bucket full of them to be given to every single individual on this planet with enough left over for the new born to get 30 carat diamond ear rings, so to stop this debeers and other diamond corporations routinely destroy, or stock up on diamonds in refuse to allow them into the market. That along with the marketing campaign has led diamonds to become one of the most valuable commodities on our planet.

If we intercepted this platinum, we could make cars out of the stuff it would be so cheap, much like the inca's and mayans who saw no value in their gold outside of ornament since it was so abundant. However rare earth metals stuff like zinc and others that i believe china has the market cornered on would be a huge relief even if they tanked it's economic value, they would be hugely useful since we need for our modern electronics, if the us acquired an asteroid like that would be much more valuable then a platinum or ruby encrusted asteroid. Also those helium deposit's on the moon are more valuable.  </TEXT>

Wtf are you on about , look up the mayan,aztec, Inca civilizations across not, south and central america, then look up the first nations before their Armageddon occurred they had earth mounts made up of dirt from across the united states, interconnected trade routes, theirs a township around Georgia or north Carolina i believe with a population at it's height which outnumbered medieval London. </TEXT>
