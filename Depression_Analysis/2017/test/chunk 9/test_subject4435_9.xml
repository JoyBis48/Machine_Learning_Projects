	<TEXT> No, you're right. He made fairly good money. But I can imagine that having to drive extraordinarily dark and scary stretches of road would compel certain people to purchase one. It's also worthy of note that 90's also covers 1999. Also, I'm prone to saying "ten years ago" and meaning the 90's, even though that's clearly not correct. But part of this sub is no disbelief so lets just go with it! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In real life I'm actually a super kind and understanding person. What irks me is that all of a sudden society has to cowtow to weakness. I've seen trigger warnings in college syllabi. I think that's absolutely ludicrous. Real life doesn't come with trigger warnings. There's not gonna be someone to warn you if you're about to walk out the door to see an assault and no one is going to cover your eyes when you see bad things happening. I think that instead of letting the fear and "triggers" win, people who can't handle it should get the help they need from a professional and learn coping skills. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you identify as a woman, than you can be any kind of woman you'd like. Butch, femme, somewhere in between, whatever. It's really that simple. Being cis or trans doesn't make you less or more of a woman than anyone else.

What I actually meant is that in my community a lot of the cis-women who are "butch" at some point in their lives, actually end up later on coming out as trans (FTM.) I'm simply asking a question about what people see in their own communities and if the image that I have is something that still exists in today's society. 

Please don't come here looking for an argument. I'm not insulting or "erasing and excluding" anyone. If you feel that way then you may need to address your own insecurities and status as a "victim." I often come across as harsh because I don't lie, or sugar coat, and I don't believe in pandering to insecurities. It is how it is.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well now... I hadn't really ever thought of it like that. Of course there is a sense of security, but I've always protected myself. I can also fix the plumbing, the car, and do basic carpentry. I'm pretty self sufficient and maintain that even in relationships (which has been a problem in the past, I'm "too independent.")So what I'm "looking for" is someone who can match that. But this isn't a post about me seeking someone, it's just asking if people like that exists in other communities. </TEXT>
