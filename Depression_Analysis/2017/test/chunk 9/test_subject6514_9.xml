	<TEXT> I could, but I would need to ship it internationally to me here in Australia. The P650SE was appealing to me, but I was under the impression the base model didn't include hard drives or operating system, and when I added these in the price difference wasn't big. Also, I need a 17" screen. Thanks for the tip though! </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Gaming Laptop - Gigabyte P37K/P37W - Is the GTX970M worth the upgrade? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-05-17 08:43:41 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi all, trying to decide whether the extra ~$400 is worth it to upgrade to the [P37W](http://www.gigabyte.com.au/products/product-page.aspx?pid=5349) from the lead in [P37K](http://www.gigabyte.com.au/products/product-page.aspx?pid=5375). The laptops are not cheap so I am trying to keep it reasonable. I specifically need a relatively high powered, thin gaming machine with internal optical drive at a min 17" screen.

From what I can see, the only difference is the upgrade from a [GTX 965M](http://www.notebookcheck.net/NVIDIA-GeForce-GTX-965M.134120.0.html) to a GTX 970M in the P37W. According to GPUBoss, the 970M is up to 35% more powerful, has a larger memory bus and higher clock speed.

Does anyone have an opinion as to whether the GPU upgrade would be worth the extra cash? I'd love some help. Also, please let me know if I am overthinking things and the 965M is perfectly solid.

Thanks! </TEXT>

Do you think he's having emergency meetings, firing people who made the paywall decisions and generally sitting there thinking 'fuck, this situation is completely fucked!' What are his options now for getting the masterrace community back onside? Can he basically scrap this whole thing, apologise and start over? </TEXT>
