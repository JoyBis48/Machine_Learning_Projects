	<TEXT> $250,000 covers a budget of one episode. Maybe two for a really cheap series which Death Parade isn't, judging from its quality.

NTV who owns Madhouse also owns Hulu Japan, so at least Death Parade functions as an original content to their catalog. Original content is becoming more important since Netflix is launching in Japan this fall. So it's not a total loss, but I wouldn't get my hopes up for a 2nd season. Although it would be a very pleasing surprise if it happens.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't use it because of the ghosting. The smoothness is cool for a 1-3 minute scene but I wouldn't be able to stand watching a whole series with ghosting.

Also there's not a lot of actual 60 fps content other than sports broadcast and some porn. The Hobbit trilogy was shot at 48 fps. Most movies and TV shows are 24 fps. A traditional animation TV show is basically 12 fps upscaled to 24 fps with repeated frames.

	<TEXT> That was an exciting episode of mostly just action scenes. Being able to convey sense of speed and the frenzy of combat was always this show's signature. I also like how the action can seamlessly transition from a wide shot of the battle to an up-close and personal view of it. There might be better choreographed action scenes out there but in terms of the full package that gets the heart racing this show's action might be the best of all the recent anime.

Some nitpicks: there were a few spots when it got choppy, some in slowmo and others during a few camera moves. There were a couple of Transformer-esque angles and super quick cuts that made things momentarily hard to follow.

Most recent one is [The Lost Breakfast](https://youtu.be/rtcH5k2-fLM).

Some are just a simple animation/artistic showcase like [in the Wind](https://youtu.be/GZ39V34qInQ).

[This page](http://www.titaniascans.com/reader/Akatsuki+no+Yona/091%3A+He+Was+a+Very+Precious+Friend/#page=25) really expressed the mixture of anger and sadness. The way Yona calmed him down was moving. The last few pages of that chapter were a fantastic mixture of emotions.

I thought we might see Zeno's ability in this arc. A bit disappointed that wasn't the case.

I'm guessing the first two episodes are anime original written by Junichi Sato and Reiko Yoshida. I'm hoping they have more written material waiting to be made into an anime series if this three episode OAV becomes a big hit.

	<TEXT> Yuhata is back in the harem game. I'm fine with the harem hijinks as breather episodes and this episode was amusing but three in a row is pushing it. I want to get back to the scheming, action and tension.

Izana's new abilities to control a Garde looks promising. It seems like there's going to be a conflict between Yure and the Captain. 

Maybe it's just me but the animation and overall presentation looked so much better in this episode. Especially the lighting; [construction site](http://imgur.com/a/jPe36#2), [sunset](http://imgur.com/a/5gYxC#0), [morning light](http://imgur.com/a/l4K1u#0) and [Thousand Year Village](http://i.imgur.com/K9mZHBP.jpg).

	<TEXT> I think for a lot of these shows the studio is really just a hired contractor. The sales are financially inconsequential to the studio and the ones that either profit or lose money from sales is the production committee that hired the studio and financed the whole project. Obviously the studio wants the show to sell well since it could make them look good and help them land more and better projects but as long as they keep getting new projects then I don't think sales are a be all and end all. That's why Deen, Satelight and Pierrot are still in business.

Also it's not all about disc sales. Some shows are made as promotional material for manga, LN, video games, merchandise and as part of a multimedia project. Additionally, ratings matter a bit more for non-late-night shows. Some of these reasons are also why recent late-night anime like Garo and Rage of Bahamut are getting 2nd seasons despite not selling well. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The number of shows indicates an increased interest in investing in anime. These shows are funded by manga, LN and video game publishers, toy/merchandise companies, TV Networks, marketing/advertising firms and other investors with varying interests. There's more to anime now than disc sales, merchandise sales and boosting manga sales. Using anime to promote LNs and video games is now common practice. We are seeing more multimedia projects that include anime. Then there's the relatively new found wealth known as streaming. Like I said, anime is the most ubiquitous as it has ever been with it being streamed on netflix, hulu, funimation, crunchyroll and other smaller streaming sites. Of course I also said this boom is not sustainable.

Regarding anime... remember how a cour used to be 13 episodes, and most shows were 2 cours? I think it's telling studios can't really afford buying airtime anymore. And the money certainly isn't going to employees.

Two cour late night shows are risky. Production committees have just gotten smarter. If the first cour is a success then they'll make another one. There's still bunch of two cour shows, most of them are daytime because TV networks don't want to reload their time slot every three months. Also studios don't usually pay for the airtime, the investors in the production committee do. Studios for the most part are hired contractors. The exception to that being when a studio wants to make an original anime or invest their own money in exchange for a larger slice of the pie.

	<TEXT> The anime was doing a good job of condensing the material early on but it's starting to feel rushed now. It was unavoidable, 90 chapters in one cour is tough to adapt no matter how good the writing staff is. Then again, as a manga reader my perspective is probably skewed, it seems like most anime only watchers are fine with the pacing.

	<TEXT> Well, he was disappointingly unspecific but then again his doom and gloom assessments has always been like that. Anime is in a boom right now, producing 30-40 shows a season and the most ubiquitous as it has ever been. Saying that's unsustainable is pointing out the obvious and can be said about any industry going through a boom period.

It might have been worthwhile if he pointed out the declining relevance of physical media which will eventually affect the industry and the possibility of a demand for higher wage which will raise production costs.

However, Mr. Anno does not think that this will mean an end to anime as an artistic form of film. He points out the possibility of the centres of anime production moving to other areas of Asia with good conditions.

Certain parts of anime production are already being outsourced to other Asian studios because it's cheaper. Being payed worse than an already underpaid Japanese animator isn't exactly good working condition. I doubt it'll change so drastically in five years that the industry would move outside of Japan. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, this really isn't true 60 fps motion interpolated since the repeated frames from the 24 fps source were included. I believe this is true for most 60 fps converted anime videos with the exception of CG scenes animated at 24 fps.

I did experiment with getting rid most of the repeated frames and just using the animated frames by cutting the fps to 12. Then motion interpolating up to 60 fps but it looked bad. So much ghosting, even just going from 12 to 24 looked bad. The posted video still have ghosting but nowhere near as bad.

Did another one:

	<TEXT> [An interview with Sorachi and his editors where they talked about the show's vulgarity and time slot.](http://forums.yorozuyasoul.com/index.php?topic=2787.0)

Oonishi: It hasnt been censored recently because of words like p*nis. Otherwise we live in fear every week. Were always like, We have no regrets if this is the last episode! And we give it our best to share it without worries. It wont be strange if it ends at any time. 

Sorachi: Makes people think, Do these people want to die? 

Saitou: Its like we stepped into a mine field. 

Sorachi: Well-prepared to die any moment. Like were looking for a place to die. 

Oonishi: I feel like I can look at things more objectively from the outside after the editors changed, but I also feel like Im tired of living, like Please kill me now! Ive been watching the re-airs at home lately, and I think if I ever have children, Ill never let them watch it. It airs at 6pm, but theres always someone saying p*nis or whatever, its terrible. It takes things too far, doesnt it, this competition mindset? 

Sorachi: I cant lose! (laugh) 

Oonishi: The Tower of Babylon (Lesson 88) aired at 6pm, yknow. 

Saitou: The Tower of Babylon... That was a bit too much. (laugh) 

Oonishi: The neighboring channel is airing Good children lets watch this! (translation) Meanwhile, this channel is airing mosaics. This might be unacceptable even for a late-night show. 

Sorachi: A forced cut and an abrupt ending, this is the true style of Gintama. But the higher-ups might get into trouble. 

Oonishi: And then it revives when its moved to the late-night slot. 

Sorachi: I think thats what they want. 

Oonishi: Like Gintama Z airs at 00:15! 

All: (laugh) </TEXT>
