	<TEXT> I feel mesmers portal will be amazing for quickly moving supply back and spawn some npc's then quickly use the portal again grab some more, I think it'll be interesting seeing how everyone's playstyles will change and adapt to the new game mode and map. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As a level 52 you're at a major disadvantage, yes you get boosted to 80 but your stats will not be as high as an actual level 80 with full gear, you really have no chance until you're level 80 yourself and have your gear and traits, just run with the zerg try and stay out of the way and toss some grenades in there, also if you're getting chased Rocket Boots, turn around Net shot then run for your life and don't forget to use Caltrops on toolkit to slow them down and your block as you run away (If you think they can still hit you). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Some mini games would be nice, like the ones from that place i can't quite remember right now.

The firing range and shield/sword training, i mean they can help with reaction times, they could even make the trainer for sword training a giant golem that puts up a bubble shield so it wouldn't look silly with a few people doing it at the same time, it's relevant to pvp at least. </TEXT>
