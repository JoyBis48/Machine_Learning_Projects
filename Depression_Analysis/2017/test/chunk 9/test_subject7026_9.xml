I'm about to try to organize my [badly sorted] (http://backpack.tf/profiles/76561198049118645) backpack and want to look at some backpacks to get an idea of some ways I could set up mine.  
  
Thanks in advance I guess :] </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The good outweighs the bad though.  
Let's imagine a new weapon that can do 300 damage as it's only upside, but it has much less ammo, much less speed, and some other downside.  
The upside on that is a hugely overpowered damage buff with some downsides that don't even matter.  
  
Now we can apply this to the loch.  
Upsides of faster speed, more distance, and more damage to Engineer crap.  
The downside of less ammo in the clip doesn't matter because the extra distance means you can sit back and fire from a distance and reload.  
The extra speed makes it much easier to hit *direct* shots on one person making the lower radius not matter at all.  
The lack of rollers doesn't matter much anyway, those are mostly for taking out nests which you can do easier with the extra damage to buildings.  
  
Loch isn't overpowered anymore but that doesn't mean it's bad. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Here's how I deal with hackers.  
  
Complement the hacker like "Yo dude those Amby shots are on point, do you play CS:GO or something?" or "Duuuude you are amazing" because then they're like "Oh thanks man really means alot to me." and then I say to the team chat "Lmao that dude is hacking."  
  
Then I say "Hey I got a pizza on the way so I'm gonna leave now, peace out." and leave the hacker to do his thing.  
  
You really can't do anything about them but leave and they mostly want to get reactions of rage, so being cool, calm and collected about it and leaving for a different reason than "AY FUCK THIS GAME I HATE YOU LMAOBOXING FUCKS" doesn't give them the satisfaction of a reaction.  
  
Or since LMAOBox is VAC undetected I use my own VAC...cinator. Throw that bad boy onto my homeboy Pringle and let him go to town with some 1337 AWP skills. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I tend to use these parts as a default if I want random things.  
  
Players Hit  
Kills While Ubercharged (Replaced with Headshots if it's a Sniper)  
Gib Kills on guns that gib, Critical Kills on weapons that I feel will crit often like a melee or something, or if it's something else I'll go for Damage Dealt.  
  
I don't know if Loose Cannon can gib or not so whatever I guess.  
I'm pretty sure Double Donks counts as 1/3 strange parts so if it does go for Players Hit and Damage Dealt. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've watched LMAOBox streams and been to the fourms a few times, apparently every copy of LMAOBox is different and that's why it's harder to find. Even if Gabe Newell himself decided to buy 30 copies of LMAOBox to shove into the VACBox they'd just be banning the versions they got.  
  
Imagine going to the beach and knowing that every grain of sand is unique (They aren't really but pretendsies) and that it's your duty to make sure that all the sand vanishes for your master plan of crashing a plane.  
  
You create a machine that can take something, scan a large area for copies of that thing and it will *poof* remove all of them.  
So you use it on a grain of sand and direct it at the beach. But nothing happens because they're all different apart from maybe 7 grains that are very similar.

	<TEXT> If you are good at the game you can counter the thing that is easy to do for other players. Gunslinger is a simple "Press 4, then 1, then mouse 1. Get kills." type of thing. If you need to be good to beat something a bad player can do it's unbalanced.  
  
[Here] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EitZRLt2G3w) is a video which talks about balancing for skill, something Valve can't do very well.  
  
Valve seriously hand the game over to this subreddit we'll take care of it like it's a newborn child. </TEXT>
