	<TEXT> It won't be stock for long ;) gonna get an exhaust set up as soon as my tax refund gets here, then lower it, CAI, Gears. Just gotta save money here and there. Things surprisingly quick. I feel like the 0-60 time has to be off, it doesn't feel like 5.4 seconds at all. I definitely am more of a "look good" type of guy. At least at this point, since I went from 145HP to 260HP and it was quick the difference. DSG is easily one of the best colors for NewEdges, or really any mustang. It hides dirt and dust pretty good, it's just rock chips that it shows like no other.  Hopefully you get your GT sometime in the near future. So much fun. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is not my car, it is my friends and I was a passenger at the time of the accident.

Story:
Went to go around a [Con-Way Freight truck](https://media.glassdoor.com/o/40989/con-way-freight-office.jpg), we had just turned onto a new street and were in 2nd, max speed I feel was 50, and when he turned to go into the other lane to pass, he turned too sharp and it kicked out and we went into the curb, then bounced and hit the truck and went under it a bit (rear bumper has a huge hole in it, and the c pillar is smashed and rear glass is all gone). After hitting the truck we went back into the curb and bounced over it, down a ditch and hit a tree.

I think its going to get totaled. What do you guys think?

It only had a CAI and a Cat-back. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think double stripes looks amazing as while. Definitely has to be black on white. Or some bright color. And the dealer put the stripe on before he bought it,  so it was included. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ill find some owners who love to park next to me, and then I find some who just don't care and park anywhere. Then there's the ones who don't care about the community behind the car, it's just another car to them. It really is just a luck of the draw. My friend gets all the mustangs parked next to him, but that's cause he's got a 15. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I didn't make them, my friend came over and took 25-30ish shots of each car with different parts of the car lit up, some with headlights on, some not, some interior light pops, mostly outside light pops. Garage door open, and closed. And he just mashed them together.   Put yeah, probably Lightroom and PS. Lol </TEXT>
