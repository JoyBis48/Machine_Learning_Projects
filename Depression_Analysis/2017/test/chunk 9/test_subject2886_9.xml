	<TEXT> Pretty much any curry benefits from a long simmer. I love my crock pot for dal (lentils), but I'm not sure if that counts as a grain.

I don't have my own recipe, but tortilla soup can be made as spicy as you want. Same with chili, but I won't open that can of worms because I'm a beans-in-chili heathen. </TEXT>

My friends are fucking nuts, and pretend to love me while I hide behind a fucking smile.

	<TEXT> My joints make it impossible to leave my apartment on a weekly basis. I did ballet for 9 years, so I'm used to sprains, dislocations, slipped disks. I'm 22 years old and have arthritis.

I slipped on the ice on my way to class Thursday morning. It didn't hurt too badly, so I didn't bother going to the Health Center on campus. Since then, it has gotten worse and worse. I serioualy think I may have re-dislocated the knee I injured last winter.

And I don't care. I've been wanting to cut again recently, so the pain from this injury is actually making me feel better. It wakes me up at night, it takes me 5 minutes to walk from my living room to my bathroom, I start crying when my cats decide to climb into my lap, but I don't want to see a doctor about it.

The guy I've been seeing thinks I have to go, even though I know that the doctor will only say things I already know (stay off it, wear your knee brace, ice and heat), but he doesn't know my history with self harm. He knows I'm depressed, and that I've been through an abusive relationship, but not that I've cut on and off for 10 years. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So, for Xmas, I got a gift certificate for my LYS. I mainly got some gorgeous wool, but also got two skeins just because they were pretty, which I never do.

http://www.imgur.com/bhqzu4n.jpeg

Here they are. The peacock one is 100g (197yd), 70/30 acrylic/wool, and the other is only 50g (109yd), but 75/25 wool/silk.

I'd like to make something I can use on a regular basis, but don't know any patterns for this small of an amount. Since I've never bought yarn without a project in mind (I know, you'd think I would have after nearly 13 of crochet), I'm stumped. Plus I've had afghans on the brain for the last year or so.

So, anyone know of good patterns for small amounts of yarn? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I recently got these three gorgeous scarves from my Grandmommy. They are all fairly light, and have at least some silk in them. The mint one and the pale pink (looks white in the photo) are both Liz Claiborne, and my sister got several Liz ones as well.

How would you style these? Today I'm wearing a mint sweater with the mint scarf, dark blue skinny jeans, and short heels in a similar color (it's gonna get up to 40F here, so I only need my stupid looking warm hat for a few hours).

	<TEXT> I'm similar. My thing is that liver and kidneys are filter organs. They filter the toxins out of the animal. Give me a fried brain sandwich and I'm happy, and I've recently gotten into buying ground beef heart, because a local farmer sells them to my favorite local grocery/health food store for super cheap, and super delicious. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am always happy to cook for people who don't like certain foods, but personally will never say that until I have tried a food in every way possible, several times.

For me, I personally cannot stand chick peas. I've had them in stews, curries, falafels, hummus, what have you. Same thing with mayo. Alone, mixed with anything, the only time I think I've eaten it without gagging was when I had walnut shrimp in Chinatown in San Francisco this past May.

So, what else fall in this category for others? Sometimes you try hard to like something and just don't, and I think that is just fine. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 22 year old female in Southern Indiana, USA. I'm a political science major and Arabic/French double minor, planning on taking a fifth year of college (and possibly picking up Dutch in that last year).

I live alone with two wonderful kitties, who are my life. I consider myself an intermediate crocheter; I have never done fancy stitches, but I can pretty easily draft patterns using the stitches I do know.

I hope to post more in 2015, and I hope to learn a lot more. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They can be, but if you make sure to either use entirely separate utensils (including cutting board) or wash evrrything in super super hot water a couple times in between, it should be ok.

As for a smaller shrimp dish, I'm a huge fan of shrimp and grits. Look for any recipe, although when I'm lazy I just put the two together, mix a boat load of butter into the grits and smother it all in Old Bay. I know it's not traditional, and Old Bay isn't as common outside Maryland, but I can find it here in Indiana if I look hard enough. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My friend has legit Celiac's, as in she gets very sick for days after ingesting any gluten at all. So I'm gonna play it safe and not use anything with gluten at all, including any utensils that have touched flour. I want to share the holiday spirit, not make her sick when it wanted to be nice.

Edit: I also have the experience of a father who needed an epi pen after eating sonething fried in peanut oil, so I'd rather be safe than sorry. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you! We both love soups that kinda require a roux or some type of flour covered seared meat, so this is very helpful!

Edit: plus we like to cook fairly in depth recipes together, so the fact that I have a copy of Mastering the Art of French Cooking plays a bit of a part. We both think of Julia Child as a personal hero, so it's been hard to adapt. </TEXT>
