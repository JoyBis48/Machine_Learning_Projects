	<TEXT> Can anyone confirm this? edit: just tried it, and no saves were wiped. I first changed the date to April 18th, saved, quit game, changed to April 19th, game ran fine. I turn off my internet connection before playing, maybe it has something to do with it, idk. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Now that was an interesting read. I was part of the ones who thought RLD was the afterlife of DEViANCE. Guess not. Also, interesting how scene drama has barely changed, even compared to the old days. It always consists in bitching about other group's cracking methods, and how they're stealing something from someone. Also, Hoodlum.VS.Reloaded-Bitch-Session-**JEW**   lol. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I usually just use scenenotice.org to find PCISO scenedrama, but damn, browsing the archive and there are so many "unsecure"/"pay2leech" scenenotices. 

Oh and also found this on pre.corrupt.net: **ColdIce.and.ZiruX.are.idiots.on.3fn3t-UNPACKME** . It's funny that in #razor on Efnet (Razor demo division) I think  he was actually there, under Zer0x or something, can't remember for sure. That was pre'd in 2006, and I saw him there last year. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Indeed. RELOADED's on it. Interestingly, there's another folder called "carmageddon reincarnation", which is a game currently on early access, being fully released on [april 23rd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmageddon:_Reincarnation). WTF, RLD? Do they intend to release that too? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hang in there. Reversers are probably used to hw checks. It will certainly take a bit more time to reverse this one since it should be new, and then needs testing to make sure it works, but still... let's hope for the best.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ok so I suppose this was expected, but the good news is that, according, to kevinyang225@3DM: 
 We find that R* use some machine info check to protect GTA5,just like Denuvo did in Dragon Age Inquisition.
 But i think Denuvo is still much harder to be cracked than RGSC.

	<TEXT> Why are you idiots downvoting this? Several groups in that pic, like ViTALiTY, Hi2U, TiNYiSO, FLT are either inactive, hardly ever (or never) release any AAA game or only crack Steam and such. Only way we'll have so many groups trying to reverse GTA V is if the protection isn't too complex. </TEXT>
