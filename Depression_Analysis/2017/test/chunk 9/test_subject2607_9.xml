Then the other day he was driving me home and said "Ya know, when I see you I don't even miss my sister. I don't need to go visit her or think about her because it's like she's right next to me again. You're both so dedicated to what you do, and you both make an effort to be kind to everybody."

I did it one time and while my friends were all having fun, I kept hearing things that weren't there and I couldn't swallow or stand up or move my feet.
