	<TEXT> Yeah. It used to be terrific blog when it was just Barry's little project with the crappy default design and LOTS of quality articles. It really shined during the previous cycle. Even today, when I research some topics I google this blog for material. The majority of the usable results I get is from 3-4 years ago and backwards.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Short and safe answer: yes. The important ones (email, bank, facebook, paypal, credit card, utilities websites, windows, etc - any password that leads to an account with real life information).

Edit: I just want to state how a good firewall is important. Lots of anti-virus, anti-malware will identify the keylogger, but they have lots of false positives. However, when a firewall prompts that a process wants access to outside world (send or receive), there should be a real good reason to allow it. Even if it's a legit program, 95% of them don't need (or shouldn't need) internet access to work properly. I can count on my hand the number of programs on my pc that get internet access. 

So in this case, even is the keylogger worked, it won't be able to send the data out. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Last I heard was that Bradley won't return as Ronnie Brooks, which is a bummer. Does anybody know if more episodes are planned and when? I really like this adaptation, and my only complain is that they stick too much to the original scripts (And as a L O fan, means I pretty much know all the plot after the opening scene. Still liked it plenty though).

So don't be the guy, that when someone calls him "the guy" (like I just did) says in reply "actually, did you know that **guy** comes from the name of Guy Fawkes and it used to mean effigy, and I just hate it when people use it differently." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Where you leave, do politicians have immunity for murder? Can they buy M1 Abrams tanks for personal use with tax payer money? how come they can't? who's enacting those law? 

So to me, if I were a person who's okay with *The System*, I would simply point out that the same laws and regulations that prevent them from murdering and buying tanks should be extended to hookers and drugs. 

Most people think *The System* works, and any flaw can be fixed within *The System*. The flaws that can't be 100% fixed are tolerable and are justifiable cost to keep *The System* running.

Now, I'm not saying they are right or wrong, but I don't see how simply pointing out something that be fixed by law is going to convince anybody.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you want a cool variation without icecream (dairy free), try frozen banana and coconut cream as a base. It works great. Make sure to peel, slice before freezing the banana. 

To that you can add any fruit (like frozen strawberries, blueberries) or cocoa poweder or cookies or peanut butter.

For refreshing taste, try mint and vanilla.

If it's too thick (but then, how can a milkshake be too thick) add coconut milk. </TEXT>

Seriously? how about: "let's throw that politician in jail and outlaw hookers and blow." Sounds like a typical liberal answer.

The concept of taxes is accepted by most people and also by many libertarians. so I don't see how giving an example of one particular wasted taxes is going to change anyone's mind. 

Everybody knows that taxes aren't 100% effective. But all the people who accept the tax concept (which is the majority of people, right after they stop bitching about it) just argue on the amount and how to spend it. </TEXT>

No. Cellphone companies are trading electronics for money. They compromise battery size because they know the majority of people prefer good bright large colorful screen, fast device, big RAM, storage, good sound quality, reliable fast connecting GPS and reliable networking. All those greatly consume battery life. 

If you don't care about thick device, some popular cellphones have [battery cases](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_2?url=search-alias%3Dmobile tag=hotoge-20 field-keywords=battery+case rh=n%3A2335752011%2Ck%3Abattery+case).  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  An artist is a person, before all else, and people often hold beliefs

Exactly. Even if she '"caved" in direct response to pressure' as OP wrote, that's fine, and by no means should be interpreted as a negative thing. Different people reacts differently to pressure, and she has every right to avoid difficult situations (if we assume it's a reaction and not political statement, which she obviously entitled to).

Hell, I know people that don't go to work because they have a little headache in the morning and they don't feel like standing in traffic, so why should be surprised when artists decide to dodge when a century old conflict knocks on their door.

I can tell this is true, because I wear suit and tie to meet clients. I'm literary raped by having to do that. Who's making me, you ask? Nobody, I'm self employed. This is how fucked and serious rape culture has become. I'm raping myself because it's what society expects of me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> [ Kendrick Lamar - i](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aShfolR6w8) - love yourself this summer.

In Baltimor, summer started early:

They wanna say there's a war outside and a bomb in the street  
And a gun in the hood and a mob of police  
And a rock on the corner and a line full of fiends  
And a bottle full of lean and a model on a scheme, yup  
These days of frustration keep y'all on tucking rotation  
I duck these gold faces, post up fee-fi-fo-fum bases  
Dreams of realities peace  
Blow steam in the face of the beast  
The sky can fall down, the wind can cry now  
The strong in me, I still smile  

 I love myself  
(The world is a ghetto with guns and picket signs)  
I love myself  
(But it can do what it want whenever it wants and I don't mind)  
I love myself  
(He said I gotta get up, life is more than suicide)  
I love myself  
(One day at the time, sun gone shine)   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Absolutely. If you can love a dog, feed him and put a roof over his head - get one. It's a win win situation. Dogs are very adaptive to their owner habits. If you leave early and get home late, the dog will get used it and probably sleep comfortably the whole time.

Edit: lots of people are saying that this isn't healthy, and I agree that it's not ideal. However, I replied to someone who compared adopting a dog to a dog living in a cage. This is far better life. And yes, you got to compensate for the time you are missing:

* wake up earlier to take the dog for a walk. If you can go on an early jog, that would be great. The dog will love it. it shouldn't even be a long jog, 2 miles is a good distance for a dog. [check this chart please](http://www.runnersworld.com/sites/default/files/dogs500.jpg).
* take long walks with him at night, if it's a big dog that can run the distance (see chart above), consider using a bicycle.
* whenever you have a day off, take the dog with you, stop at the beach or at the park. 
* those are good ideas not only for the dog, but for you as well.
* consider getting a walker. Depends on where you live, those shouldn't cost much. If you can't find one, you can also talk to a kid in your neighborhood that will take the dog out after school for few bucks.

Anyway, while I hear lots of those comments and agree with them, remember that the most important thing you can for a dog is to love him, show your affection, communicate with him, feed him properly and have fun with him while you are around. so if you are busy, it might not be 100% ideal, but not everything in life is. This is still better than a dog sitting in a cage in some shelter where he feels like nobody.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As other have explained, it's a matter of percentage within population. 

There's also another (unmeasurable) issue: how much of it justifiable? I'm not talking just about the final kill, but life events. For example, if [white kids are more likely to sell drugs, but black kids are more likely to go to prison for drug charges](http://www.csdp.org/publicservice/kids.htm), then black kids are more likely to grow up as criminals and have future trouble with the law. 

So even if all police harassment is race-blind, there are still underlying issues that increases the chances of black people to be involved in such incidents.

There's nothing wrong with ID all by itself. However, in the current social environment and ID issues, lack of ID targets very specific demographics. 

If, let's say, there's a major move to provide everyone with ID ([like many other countries](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_national_identity_card_policies_by_country#Countries_with_compulsory_identity_cards)), then it would be reasonable to force ID when voting after a grace period of few years. </TEXT>

Well, his economic views are as far from libertarianism as possible. 

I mean he's mostly against free trade, pro minimum wage, pro workers rights by law, heavy wallstreet regulation, etc. and there's the government intervention/stimulation angle which most Libertarian economists are against.

I'm don't mean to phrase them as bad policies, that's up to debate. But overall, don't expect much love at /r/Libertarian. </TEXT>
