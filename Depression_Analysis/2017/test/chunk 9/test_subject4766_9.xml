	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Anyone who wanted to play the master chief collection has already bought an xbox one. 

The ending of halo 4 would probably convince quite a lot of PC players to buy halo 5 and an xbox one. As a result MCC on PC would drive more sales for halo 5 and xbox one. This is something ms could use to their marketing advantage like. "play halo 4 on PC before halo 5 on xbox one with the master chief collection on pc in 1080p/60fps" idk im not a marketing guy lol just an idea. 

in the end just put the game on steam. Give it a bit of discount for having pc gamers wait so long and watch the money flow in. Everybody wins.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> With news that sony and marvel might be arguing over who the next spider-man should be it's got me a bit worried. I've been trying to think if there's anything Sony could do to possibly back out of the deal with Marvel if Sony doesn't like working with Marvel.

One would assume that Marvel/Disney aren't that stupid and they would of had their lawyers double and triple check the contract before signing it to make sure Sony couldn't find away to back out. But I'm curious if there is? Any lawyers here familiar with things like this? Would Sony be able to make a case if they don't like working with marvel and cant decide on a spider-man and want to back out of the deal. could they? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Remember the marvel event last October? Feige said that anything that wasn't announced then was ether stll in development or just pure rumor and speculation. He was asked about Benedict Cumberbatch at the time and basically said his casting was still in negotiations and unfortunately he wasn't cast till about a month or to after the event. Feige apparently had his phone ready and waiting for the call to announce Cumberbatch at the event but these things take time. Especially when dealing with such young actors their probably nervous about signing on to such a strict contract like this.  </TEXT>

So whoever they cast needs to be commited and wont try and walk out on the role when the going gets tough or when they get older and want to try other things.  </TEXT>

I think Ant-Man will do better mostly because of its connection to the MCU. Mean while FF has already had two bad movies under its belt and people haven't forgotten those so they may not be as willing to give this reboot a chance.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Totally agree. I have always said the consoles need to put FPS over resolution. A higher frame rate just makes the game that much more enjoyable when your not noticing stutter or clipping when moving around. It doesn't make sense to have the game running at 1080p when the hardware clearly cant handle it.  </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2015-05-29 02:57:30 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I think there needs to be a time jump in season 4. Have season 4 take place 1 or 2 years post season 3. That way they can get as far away from it as possible. Have Oliver and Felicity develop a proper relationship during that time off screen so we don't need to see her cry every time Oliver does something she doesn't approve of and they wont have to mention anything that happened in season 3 ether except for maybe Saras death then they can jump straight into the action in season 4. Have some devastating event that causes Oliver to come out of retirement and return to starling city and bam just like that you got season 4 the rest is up to the writers on what story they have planned hopefully its something awesome.
