	<TEXT> Read the post again. What the Op suggests is that, similar to the effect of overindulgence in anything, the result in this particular case is a sever weakening. He also emphasizes the fact that it is natural. Meaning abstinence (especially where it is forced, which is in almost every case) is wrong and harmful. But it is a very damaging thing to indulge in doing so in excess. 
Note here I am speaking about sexual intercourse and not masturbation, which is demeaning and should be avoided. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That "your words reflect your level of thinking" is the bitter truth. You can either own your words and defend them or resort to looking down on others. Yes, my life must be miserable indeed.

Spending tax payer money, or any other person's money for that matter, on stadiums is a waste of time and benefits no one. That is your level of thinking. Own it, and do not be so cowardly! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The sooner we as a people realize that football and a host of all other 'professional' sports serve as nothing but a sink in society, the better. They are a sink on our limited resources. It is:

- a waste of time;

- a waste of building material and resources;

- a waste of energy in the form of electricity, fuels and human energy

Not in the least is that it is a waste of psychic energy. In short, it is pointless exercise. A golden calf which we all dance around as if under a spell.

If you are going to down vote this comment, please provide me with a logical reason as to why you feel a game of football in some way adds anything of value to us as a society. Matter of fact, how does humanity profit from such endeavors? (and giving examples of equally worthless things that we do is not proof or endorsement, it is merely enumerating the many pointless things that we do as a society).

edit: spacing. </TEXT>

How can you honestly sit there and insist that without a football stadium we can find nothing else to do with the space that is a downtown. How so very creative you must be... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> By your logic, good behavior and bad behavior should face the same consequences. Politically correct much?
It is akin to saying: You are limited in how much you can contribute to political campaigns and therefore you should be limited in how much you can contribute to a campaign that provides help to the less fortunate. 
What part about the world needing to shift from oil eludes you?

edit (to add): and if 'hivemind' is a way for you to look down on people, consider that it is also hivemind that is against genocide, warcrimes, suffering of children, hunger and deprivation, yes. All of these are examples of 'hivemind'.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You bring up a very very valid point.
It is interesting how these silly publishers are pricing themselves right out of the market. I can verify that over my years in graduate school, i have seen an increase in the percentage of graduate and undergraduate students purchasing books from India and China via internet or friends. That is a problem also.

But when you think about your concern, you are projecting the current status in isolation when you talk about taxes and repayment. Here is a simple analogy: Think of bearing the cost of free education (here we will just assume the cost stays artificially inflated) as hoisting a giant tower. You know, the old fashioned way with ropes and several people pushing and pulling ropes etc. The building we are trying to erect is free education, and the burden of the weight on the men represents the tax burden on the citizens. 
Now add to this the idea that with each year, you will have strong and well built men added to the party pushing and pulling the weight. The effect is less workload on each one. And progressively, there is an exponential increase in the number of people bearing the weight and a corresponding decrease in workload for each one.

TL;DR: The current inflated cost of education is a problem that can't be ignored. The cost of funding free education will be reduced based on the fact that the latter causes an exponential increase in high income earners in society (ie. more people paying more taxes as a result of being highly educated). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Actually your first point, again, is the correct one.
It could be as revolutionary as shrinking the high school curriculum and modifying the structure of university/college.
By 18, you are already an adult and should have acquired the basic skills necessary to become a productive member of society. This was the premise decades ago with the high school system. Now, we have outgrown this model. The result is that young adults spend much of their time ruminating the halls of high school either partying or wasting away very precious time of development.
What does one learn in the years before university and why does it take 18 years? Does my point make sense? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No, that is not a bad thing. It is the general discussion of the matter that will bring out everything that needs to be considered to do it right. As you have pointed out, if we tilt the scales without providing the environment for and skills that will allow people to break into entrepreneurial endeavors, then we will have a catastrophe as you pointed out. 
So your points and concerns are actually very well founded and important sir/madam.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Think about the advancement of society in general. The skills acquired in high school, perhaps many decades ago, was sufficient for the basic skills necessary to participate in society.

	<TEXT> 1. Up vote for contributing a differing opinion.

Here is one scenario, which I feel you haven't factored into the outcome of such an idea. You have stated that the number of people with a good education will increase, thereby leading to an increase in the number of applicants for a job. But you have not factored a corresponding increase in the number of available jobs. Why would the number of available jobs increase? Well, if you think about the fact that education doesn't just equip you to look for employment, it primarily equips you with skills, which can either translate to working as an employee, or developing a business.
So you would expect an exponential growth in the number of available jobs based on the number of new businesses created because more people are equipped with the ability to do so.

This is just one factor. There are many many more. </TEXT>
