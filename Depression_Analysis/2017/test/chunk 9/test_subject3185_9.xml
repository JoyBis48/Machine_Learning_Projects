	<TEXT> ok no worries. I don't like it because it doesn't fit reddit rules of personal information and encourages people to investigate someone who might not want attention or a discussion about them about them.  e.g. There are plenty of people who are pissed off with the battlebots live experience so far.  
https://www.reddit.com/rules/

I left it for a week but it was slowly bothering me for the moderation standard it would set.   So it stays removed.   If people with battlebots associations want to start discussions about their experiences under their real name that would be cool.  Similar to /r/IAMA with vertification.  Maybe better to do it on /r/IAMA and link to it from here  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi.

/r/battlebots is a community for fans of Battlebots, robot combat and the wider world of the world of competitive robotics.

There is a new tv series starting soon and so I am expecting the subscribers in the sub to grow substantially and fast.

This could be a fun snoo to create.

Any input appreciated.

	<TEXT> I'm trying to figure out why do x86 emulation rather than just making an x86 chip.

Does x86 emulation avoid licencing fees? Or is is the chip designed for more specialist applications rather than the mass market? If so, why bother with x86 at all?


If I had to guess, it's because this chip's primary purpose isn't running x86 code; it's running Elbrus code! But it's handy to have x86 compatibility, for legacy software and other stuff that hasn't yet been ported.

I think an x86/x86-64 license would be required from Intel/AMD, even if it's only an abstraction layer and not a hardware implementation. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> With this latest news Rightscorp must certainly be on its last legs. The 
shareholders' confidence was already in the toilet and this certainly 
won't help any. This case should prove to them, once and for all, that Rightscorp is run by greedy morons and bottomfeeders who don't comprehend the first thing about the legal system.

The entire basis of Rightcorp's business model is leveraged upon ignorance and can only succeed where those they are pursuing are ignorant. This particular action of Rightscorp against CBeyond proves it quite handily. Ignorance is, especially in the information age, only temporary and, therefore, the stragegic basis upon which any alleged early "successes" Rightscorp ever had are now quickly evaporating. If I were a Rightscorp shareholder I'd cut my losses now while my shares still had at least a little bit of value left.

A subpoena has no force of law unless it's signed by the judge. The signature of the court clerk only evidences that it's been filed with the court, nothing more.

I'd like to say "Kudos to Christopher Bunce" but all he was doing was what every other ISP's legal counsel should be doing -- telling the copyright trolls to get a valid court order to produce client records. But to get that the trolls must first file a lawsuit for copyright infringement and, then, under that lawsuit, pursue client records under Discovery.

Tragically, there are still a few ignoramuses in charge of ISPs that don't understand the basics of due process of law, so instead of telling copyright trolls to go pound sand (or better yet, just ignore their color of law "subpoenas") they sometimes ignorantly hand over customer records at the drop of a hat. Such ISPs could easily learn a few things from this case... if they wanted to. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Pinging /u/twister662  - Please see this thread.   

As a quick fix, I've commented out your changes to the css just to revert us back to something that works for everyone.  I really liked how it was before and I could see what you were trying to do here with the dark background.  Unfortunately, the current state  meant a broken experience for many users.  Not sure if you realised this.     You can still make of the css whatever you want as you got some great ideas.  I only patched it because it was unreadable for many.   </TEXT>

You can remove the custom styles using this link
http://www.reddit.com/r/battlebots+nocss

I agree it is hard to read at the moment.  I am not a fan of white on black styles for reading .   Maybe it is my old eyes.

However, I can see what it is trying to be and it has the potential to look good.  It did use to look really good a few weeks a go and it was from the same mod.  This restyle just needs some tweaks. 

I don't want to step on the work of other mods too much as it was only changed yesterday and so might be a work in progress.  So suffer for a day and if it nothing changes I'll revert or fix it.



EDIT: Ok I'll fix some of it as we got black text on a black background in the body text of self posts!  So it is broken/


EDIT2:  I think it looked good and worked  if you had RES installed and have it on night mode.  Otherwise it was broken and sometimes unreadable.

	<TEXT> The way I see it, they are giving away access to their limited internet because that is of benefit to their advertising business.  It will lead to monoplies and undesirable stuff if left unchecked in the long term.  However, in the short term it is a finacially viable way of giving internet access to the poor.  They would not fund internet.org if there wasn't some stong benefit for them. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is the time to stop mega corporations from deciding the fate of the country. The time to rise against monopolization, against the internet sales tax, against the destruction of net neutrality. This is the person you want, people. Look at Sanders' record, look at his YouTube videos where he exposes all the evil shit that is going on.

The time is here for us to make a difference and to take back the country. 

Vote Sanders.
