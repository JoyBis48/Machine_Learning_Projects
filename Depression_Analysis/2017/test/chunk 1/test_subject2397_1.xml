Of course if the WSU team that played Rutgers played Nevada I think we would've won. I do however think our home game schedule will be to our advantage since they're against some tough teams but home field advantage will be in our favor. Go Cougs! </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I've seen the show too many times so I tend to get seasons mixed up but I'd say for most the show Marshal is a corporate lawyer which according to the show/real life makes a lot of money. Plus Lily has a teacher's salary albeit not great but still. So why are they always seemingly broke? Even if Lily spent her entire paychecks on clothes I don't see how they'd be tight on money, and Marshal's school debt would be bad but I doubt he doesn't have a plan on it. Any thoughts? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I got a tent last summer and haven't been able to use it and don't have a car. I'm wondering if there's any secret spots in Pullman that you could set up a tent for the night without anyone noticing. Anyone know of spots? </TEXT>
