	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm interested in a bit of an overview of all major changes in hunting patterns, so feel free to take 'early humans' to mean any period you're most interested in answering for.

Anyway, I'm just curious as to how early humans actually approached a hunt. When did traps become popular? Did humans usually approach hunting in small or large groups? Silently, or did we tend to just bumrush animals with spears and arrows? Was it typical for a human to be able to just spear an animal for a kill with little effort, or would most hunts involve chasing an animal until it was tired, throwing out spears/arrows until it was too exhausted to avoid them. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Anyone from [this list](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_current_heads_of_state_and_government) is valid, however, for the sake of simplifying things, feel free to just use the leaders you're familiar with and see if someone one ups you.

* Round 1: an all out fight in a large, empty arena. No hiding or leaving the arena until everyone has tapped out, been knocked unconscious or been killed.

* Round 2: A large woodland, 5km by 5km. Everyone starts at a random location with no knowledge of the area. Tools are their standard attire (eg. Obama in a suit etc), a hunting rifle with 12 shots, a handgun with a single bullet, a machete and two litres of water. They must hunt each other and survive the elements until only one is standing. Weather conditions are cold, prone to rain. Water and animal life is scarce. There are some bears, but most animal are not aggressive. This is mostly a test of survival skills and hunting ability - both the ability to remain undetected and to detect others.

* Round 3: Each leader gets the powers commonly attributed to them in popular culture and propaganda. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Could the Borg create more efficient soldiers if needed? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-07-30 04:06:54 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Some of the key characteristics of the Borg is their very stiff movement and a disregard for their environment save for their immediate objectives. While this works well for them when you treat the drones as simple fodder to achieve low key objectives, with most of their strength coming from their advance technology and space warfare, they would still be highly inefficient in ground combat.

I'm not saying they'd be bad, they can hand a large amount of firepower, are probably quite accurate with phasers and have exceptional strength - you wouldn't want a bunch of Borg advancing on your position. But they're still less efficient then they could be - they don't seem to exhibit a lot of fine motor movement which would be handy for navigating a battlefield (trenches, caves, barricades, etc) nor do they run, meaning it would be easy to retreat from them, they could get picked off easily, etc.

**So my question is this:** do the Borg simply not possess the technology to make highly efficient, 'athletic' Borg soldiers? Or is it simply due to the fact that it is not required of them to achieve their goals that making Borg this complex would use more resources than they would gain? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Planet of the Apes takes place on Earth all along </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-07-27 22:36:37 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I've rewatched the original movie a couple of times since the reboot has been out, and I noticed a few things over the course of the film that I believe support this hypothesis.

First, before I go into this, you have to keep in mind that Taylor and his crew traveled FORWARD through time for many thousands of years, giving enough time for all the necessary changes to take place. Now, onto the evidence.

Firstly, when Taylor arrives of the Ape planet, he discovers that it is perfectly hospitable. The right makeup in the air, the right distance from the sun, drinkable water, etc. The odds of this happening are actually incredibly slim. Even an amateur astronomer can tell you that. It's not definitive proof, since there could be some fluke that makes an equally habitable planet with the same landscapes and sky as Earth, but it's highly unlikely and is a big hint that this planet may be Earth right off the bat.

Secondly, evolution is a very complex thing, and it is not conceivable to think that by sheer luck, a second planet would evolve humans, apes and horses on it AND that Taylor would happen to land on that planet. This is absurd. The apes and Taylor also share a common language - English. Whatever happened on Earth during these few thousand years to eliminate the humans and cause the apes to become smart was not enough to eliminate written and spoken language. The apes adopted this language as their own, allowing Taylor to communicate with them. Also many of the apes names are also human names, clearly adopted in addition to the English language.

Third; at the end of the movie, Dr. Zaius hints at some sort of catastrophe. Something clearly happened on this planet and could explain its current state - like a war that reduced the humans to small tribes allowing the apes to take over.

Finally, the very last scene shows Taylor confronting the statue of Liberty, an Earth structure. His inititial assumption is that the statue of liberty was blown up and the debris traveled through space. I suggest that the statue has been in this position all along, just decayed with time... **EARTH** </TEXT>

	<TITLE> How surprising were traditional plot twists in TVs and movies when they first aired? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-07-27 06:38:48 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Alright, first things first, I'm not sure if this is appropriate for this subreddit, so if not let me know and I'll delete the post. If anyone knows of a better place, please share. So onto the question...

I've been watching a lot of older sci-fi and it all seems very twist heavy, and it got me thinking, how surprising where the twists when they first appeared in cinema? On one side of the coin - even if you hadn't seen or heard of the twists before, you can still 'see them coming', they all seem kind of obvious. However, today's audiences are probably more trained to that sort of thinking, right? Would older twists have been more likely to take people by surprise, even if they'd seem obvious to movie goers today? Twists still predated movies and television too, so it's not like it was a new concept.

Some specific examples I'm interested in - were most people surprised by the twists in:

* Planet of the Apes
* In general, The Twilight Zone
* Hitchcock's Psycho
* Soylent Green
* Invasion of the Body Snatchers (haven't seen original, but I'm referencing the end of the 1978 version where it leads you to believe he is human trying to fit in, but is actually 'snatched')
* That one dude being a robot in Alien (forgot his name) </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> The real life counterparts of Donkey Kong and the bosses from his last two games battle it out in a series of 1v1s. These are rough approximations of the animals real life counterparts and some liberties had to be taken (especially with the more fictional bosses from the first game).

**Donkey Kong**

Stronger side of the typical Gorilla. Approximately 200kg, 1.9m tall.

**Opponents:**

* Ba-Boom, a Chacma Baboon, the largest of the baboon species. Around 45kg, about 1.1m tall.

* Bashmaster, a large polar bear, around 650kg size male.

* Pompy, a full grown sea lion, around 300-350kg, about 2.5m long

* Lord Fredrik, a male pacific walrus around 2,00kg

* Mugly, fictional, so let's just say he sort of triceretops like in stature I suppose

* Thugly, we'll say a White Rhinoceros, about 3,500kg and 3.5 long

* Colonel Pluck and his Stompybot 3000. No real world equivalent, so instead it's a man driving a Smart Car (can attempt to run the Gorilla down)

* The ragtag bunch, all the leftovers team up against the gorilla: a mole, a gray owl, a yellow blowfish, a dodo and 3 Japanese Spider Crabs.

**Round 1**

Each boss fights our gorilla. Who wins? Does Donkey Kong sweep the competition in real life, or does he find himself greatly outclasses? Each battle takes place on a plain, open field in daylight. The animals are displaying their fullest aggression.

**Round 2**

Of all the animals that beat the gorilla, who of those would be victorious if they all fought eachother? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Lucious Fox is Batman </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-07-11 06:16:26 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So it's been a pretty big secret to who this Batman character really was with many characters discussing the possibilities throughout the movies. But I think I have gathered enough evidence to show that Lucious Fox was indeed Batman the whole time.

1. Lucious had access to all the technology that Batman had used throughout the series as the head of Wayne Enterprises military contracts division. This can be clearly seen from all the scenes in which he is showing off the technology to the Bruce Wayne character.
2. The movie spends a disproportionately large amount of time focusing on Bruce Wayne and Harvey Dent for some reason. Why? So it seems more natural to have Lucious Fox on screen.
3. Lucious Fox CLEARLY hints at being Batman in the scene where he is confronted by that accountant dude or whatever.
4. Batman dresses in all black. Lucious Fox is black
5. Why the Bat theme? Bruce Wayne has a fear of bats. Lucious spends a large time around Wayne. Wayne most likely relayed his fear of bats to Lucious
6. There is no other likely contender from the movies main characters (Dent would be too busy during the day to go around at night crime fighting, Alfred is too old, Gordan and Batman are seen on screen at the same time, Bruce Wayne is too busy working out, taking tours of the military contract division, hiding from the public eye and playing with bat themed military gadgets to go around crime fighting)
7. I zoned out of the movies a lot to be honest, which means that there was probably LOTS of evidence I overlooked suggestions Lucious is Batman, which is EVIDENCE IN ITSELF. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> [So I posted this the other day](http://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/29886w/do_i_need_to_apply_new_thermal_paste/) to PCmasterrace. Seemed like I needed to replace my thermal paste, so I did yesterday, but it hasn't seemed to have helped my temperature issues. I'm still hitting the same temperatures. After the paste didn't work the first time, I took it off to check it looked right (it did) and reapplied a second time. So I'm guessing it's not the paste (unless there's a break in period, but I haven't noticed even a slight temperature drop. Paste was Deep Cool Z9).

Is there anything else that might be wrong that I should check? I have a Corsair H50 and it feels like water is still being pumped when I put my finger on the tubes.

What should I check next? </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Firstly, I'm not amazingly good with computers. I've installed a new graphics card in the past but that's about it.

Anyway, currently, my CPU's temperature is sitting at about 70-75 degrees celcius when idle and 80+ when gaming. I haven't had any performance issues until today, so I don't know how long its been hitting this temperature for, but it's seems to be causing some issues today.

I cleaned off the fans and checked how fast they were spinning with speedfan (CPU fan 4450 rpm, system fan 1580 rpm). I did a quick google and these speeds seem to be normal. So that leaves me with two possibilities.

The first is that water cooling system. I didn't build this PC, but the person who did told me I shouldn't need to do anything with this maintenance wise since its a closed system. Is this true?

If so, that leaves the heatsink. It's (obviously) very hot to the touch. I'm a little worried about taking it off since I'm worried I'll fuck up my PC, but is this the likely issue? How can I check for certain before I try reapplying paste? And anything I should know before doing so?

Thanks.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Just for some fun, what ideas would you like to see for future Steam events? Considering most people are unhappy with the direction Steam's sale events have taken (cash grab instead of achievement hunts) what would you like to see instead?

My idea is probably a little too much effort for how little Valve would get out of it, but it would be cool to see a series of 'Camp Contests' utilising the current team system instead of buying items in the top Valve games.

For example, a Dota 2 could have a special queue open that matches you with people on your Steam team. The winning team contributes 50 points, each tower 10 points and each kill 1 point to your team's summer sale score.

Could do similar with TF2 and CS:GO as well as . In addition to random players on the winning team each day getting their games, top 5 MVP's from each game (any team) could get their wishlist games or something.

Of course, I doubt this would ever happen since it's harder to monetize, but I think it'd be a much more exciting community event instead of this money spending competition. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> With only 15 crafted, I wanted to get an idea of their current value. I had a look on Dota2lounge and the steam market and can't find the level 5 treasure or the helmet in either place. It's gotten me curious: do you think some of those 15 that have been crafted so far may never see the light of day? Although Dota 2 has a huge fanbase, there are still people who haven't played it or stopped playing it and may not realise the value of the item they have. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I never played it online and I really hope SSB WiiU has some proper matchmaking system instead of just queuing you with completely random individuals - that'd just lead to a series of one sided matches.

Even something simple like Mario Kart's system. So did Brawl have a matchmaking/ranking system and if so, was it any good at pairing you with like-skilled individuals? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Why did the computer make this move? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-06-17 16:50:13 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I'm not particularly good at Chess, so maybe I'm overlooking something obvious. But, I sometimes like to set up random positions against the Chess.com computer and play against it at max strength and get utterly trounced by it. But today it made a weird move.

I'll start from a few moves in - personally I find context helps, but better players can probably just skip to the next paragraph if you'd rather just jump straight to the point. Basically, starting from [THIS](http://imgur.com/cVLxxma) position (me white, computer black) I took the computer's Queen with the a pawn. It took my castle with the black square bishop and captured that bishop with my knight. Then the computer moved the king to D7 and I captured the second Bishop. It moved the King to C6 leaving us [HERE](http://imgur.com/51se0oN).

Then I realised my Knight was trapped and just moved to capture the black pawn with my knight. [May as well take a pawn if I'm moving my knight](http://imgur.com/doWtvLG). I expected the computer to just recapture with the King, but instead it did moved the rook on a8 to a1. I captured the rook with my remaining rook for a free piece and [THEN it took the knight with the king.](http://imgur.com/tZ4YTIn)

So, basically, why did the computer (set at the strongest difficulty) throw away the rook like that? I'm sure it's something obvious that will make me facepalm. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Would you like to see complimentary Io sets? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-06-17 01:22:23 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Just an idea (probably not an original one), but how would you guys feel about seeing complementary item sets for Io and his partners?

For example, CK and Io could each have a "Global Chaos" set for whatever. Io cosmetics are hard, but maybe custom tether animation, Wisp balls that look 'Chaos Knightish' and makes his colour a more darkish red. Maybe CK's set adds some Io elements somehow.

Anyway, when both have their sets equipped, they'd get a more powerful looking tether animation, different relocate symbol and relocate timer and other assorted effects unique to that set.

Could do this with all Io partners. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> After reading [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/27hb10/a_game_named_steam_the_game_appeared_on_store_for/), what would you like to see in a Steam 'meta' game?

An actual simulation of using Steam similar to the [Newgrounds sim](http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/236362)?

A unique TCG featuring Valve characters and other popular Steam game card sets?

Maybe a mini-game HUB (Chess, Poker, Checkers, and other traditional board and card games complete with ladders and rankings)?

These last two could follow Valve's traditional F2P model and would help tighten the Steam community.

Or is this too much of a cash n' grab? What other ideas could be cool? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Wanting to get into an MMORPG. Tried a few, but they have been underwhelming so far </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-02-09 12:46:02 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I really like the idea of MMORPGs, but the few I've played have failed to truly engage me. Could someone recommend me something - preferably an upcoming title - that might actually satisfy me. 

The ones I put the most time into were:

* Star Trek Online: Loved the space battles and just the general feel of traveling through space. But everything else sucked. Combat felt skill-less, lack of variety in ship parts. Once the space battles began to grow repetitive I found myself completely bored with the game.
* Guild Wars 2: Felt very fun and polished at first, but I never quite made it to endgame. It felt incredibly spammy and the classes felt very homogenized. But man, the combat, so spammy. I also disliked how leveling up meant next to nothing and equipment was practically the same for everyone.
* World of Warcraft: The big one. I actually just made my first character two days ago. I'm currently level 6 and all I've done is walk around killing x monsters for quest y. Over and over. I understand I'm 10 years late to the party, so I don't blame the game, but playing it for the first time in 2014 it looks bad, it plays bad, the spells feel so unfun and the quests are terrible. I've barely played it so I'm not going to make final judgement on it, but if the quests continue at this pace I can't see myself putting in more than another hour or two.

**Preferred Genres (Fantasy, Sci-Fi, etc.):** Any, but a good ship based Sci-fi would be great

**Pricing Model:** Any

**Favorite Features:** Engaging combat - the more skill based the better, smooth and 'flowing' combat (for comparison, WoW and Star Trek's ground combat feel pretty 'clunky'), good ping on Oceanic servers for Australians a plus

**Combat Type**: Any

**Released or Upcoming:** Either, preferably upcoming


Eve Online seems like the obvious choice, but I'd prefer recommendations other than that. It's on my to do list, but currently I feel like it's too big of a time investment from what I've heard, I just wouldn't have time to properly get into it between work and Uni. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This looks pretty similar to Tribal Wars, a game I used to love a fair bit. However I've heard this is pay to win? Is it true?

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I know these sorts of topics are starting to become a bit disliked here, but I'm really interested in this one.

It's Geralt from the books. He has been hired to slay the beast and thus gets a reasonable amount of prep time (say a few days)/knows what he's getting into. He has all his swords and any potions from his universe available to him. If the monster has a weak point, he is aware of it. The monster is being introduced into the Witcher universe for this battle so Geralt can only use the resources from that universe to create monster traps or whatever will aid him in the battle.

The battle takes place in an environment that the monster has chosen to settle down in. Ie., if the monster likes swamps, it will naturally habitat a swamp somewhere in the Witcher universe for the fight.

Also use a loose definition of the word 'monster'. Basically just keep human-like species and superheroes out of the mix.

TL;DR: What's the strongest monster a fully prepared Geralt of Rivia can beat. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Which timeframe would serve as the best point for a new Star Trek series? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-01-25 18:44:36 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm sure discussing ideas for new Trek series has probably grown long since uninteresting to everyone here, but I'm going to give this discussion a shot anyway!


When would be the best timeframe for a new Trek series to be set? For example, do you think the technological advancements made at the end of Voyager would make a post-Voyager Trek too uninteresting setting? By 2400~, Starfleet has already created technologies that allow a ship to be modified to go toe to toe with multiple Borg ships (keep in mind these are just modifications, so the actual ships from 2400 would be even stronger). Time travel also seems to be ridiculously easy and rampant at this point. Would a series set in this point in time deal with too much 'overpowered' stuff and rely too heavily on introducing ludicrously strong antagonists to compensate? And coming up with reasons why X technology can't be used to solve problem Y? 


Could a new Trek series deal with a technological stagnation - or maybe even regression - in a post year 3000 Star Trek (or whenever the Star Trek time travel from Enterprise took place)? Or is this moving too far away from the franchises beginnings?


What about setting a show in the past again (except this time: actually dealing with historical Trek storylines instead of introducing new ones...)? What era would be most suitable for this purpose? Or has all the interesting stuff already been dealt with?


TL;DR: If a new Trek were to be made, when should it be set and why? Keeping in mind this is not for ideas for a new Trek, but rather meant for a discussion of the state of the current Trek universe and what challenges may be present in creating a new Trek, although it's fair if concepts for shows naturally creep in. Just don't give us the script to your pilot ;) </TEXT>

	<TITLE> ELI5: How is it possible to survive 40 years without sleep (Paul Kern)? </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> After reading on wiki about [Paul Kern](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Kern) I am curious about a few things. Firstly, the article is very lackluster. Is this case considered to be genuine, and if so, are there any modern theories as to how he lost the ability to sleep?

Secondly, most theories of sleep treat sleep as a regenerative function (some treat it as a way of conserving energy). If sleep truly is a regenerative function, how is it theoretically possible for Paul Kern to have functioned (he reported feeling not-tired 24/7) without sleep?

Lastly, would it be viable to deliberately damage people's brains in the same fashion to eliminate the human need for sleep? What exactly where the drawbacks in Kern's situation? </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Kirk, Picard, Sisko, Janeway and Archer have been plucked from their respective timeline (their peak in each series to be precise) and forced to face-off in a showdown of 11 events. The winner in each category earns two quatloos, second place one quatloo, and the worst contender loses a quatloo (can go negative). Who places where in each category and who comes out with the most quatloos?

* **ACAMEDIA**
* Round 1: Kobayashi Maru test
* Round 2: Starfleet grade average (can select own course and electives as per standard Starfleet academic course)
* Round 3: Quiz-off: Five player Jeopardy showdown

* **ATHLETICS AND FITNESS**
* Round 4: 400 meter dash
* Round 5: Tennis doubles playoffs (2nd in command as their partner)
* Round 6: Highest climb of Mount Everest before giving up/dying
* Round 7: Who survives the longest against a Gorn in a cage match (standard wrestling cage).

* **DIPLOMACY**
* Round 8: A series of debates on ethical issues
* Round 9: Best handling of an accidental first contact with a primitive civilization (holodeck so each scenario is starts exactly the same) 

* **MACKIN' ON SPACE BABES**
* Round 10: Who can pick up the most people in one week.

* **BATTLE ROYALE**
* Round 11: A series of 1v1 fights. No weapons, fight in standard TOS uniform. Takes place in a boxing arena. No rules, any fighting style, fight until one contender concedes or dies.

Tennis match, debates and battle royale are all round robin format. Everyone challenges everyone else with a point awarded for a win. Most points to least points to determine final winners of that category.

Edit: My Reddit formatting sucks, this will have to do :) </TEXT>

His magic seems to be limited to resurrectiobn.,

I always pictured him as some all powerful reality bender (just based on how people talk about him), but it seems he would lose to any decent military, any moderately high tier superhero in a 1v1, or pretty much any of the major Kaiju, right?

	<TITLE> What are the power rankings (physical combat) of these species? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-12-27 13:42:07 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Vulcans, Klingons, Jem'hadar, Humans, Romulans, Cardassians and Gorn.

As I understand, Vulcans are the strongest. Even Vulcans who don't seem to actively engage in physical fitness seem to be very strong. I believe Sisko said a fit Vulcan is three times as strong as a fit human.

Apart from that, I've never quite known where everyone else sits. For example, Romulans are meant to be closely related to Vulcans, but they don't seem to have their intelligence or psychic powers, so is their physical strength at all similar?

Klingons are inconsistent. Some times they're taken down in batches by humans they outnumber, yet they're meant to be a fierce warrior race. On the flipside, there is an episode where B'ellana Torres beats a Vulcan in a fight, despite B'ellena not being 100% Klingon or a combat specialist (and looking much scrawnier than the average Vulcan), while the Vulcan was in a rage. Now he may have just been a particularly weak Vulcan, but he certainly didn't seem to be. Apart from that instance, I've always seen their reputation as warrior having more to do with their relentlessness than their actual strength, with them being roughly on par with humans in all aspects bar durability (redundant organs etc).

Jem'hadar are genetically designed to be a super warrior species, but they don't seem any stronger than humans or Klingons. Meanwhile, Gorn are stronger than humans, but slower, meaning a fight could go either way (maybe if Kirk were a boxer he might have been able to outmaneuver and beat the Gorn down?). Also are they stronger than Vulcans? 

Cardassians seem like a wildcard.

Am I on the mark with most of this? Is there an official power ranking index or something (like how Marvel ranks their characters out of 7(?) in categories such as intelligence, strength, powers, etc.)? </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Excuse me if I'm getting some details wrong, I haven't seen Voyager since it's original run. Anyway... What limits are there on the Q's power? What is the source of their power?

For example, in "Death Wish" we see Quinn actually transport Voyager to the time of the big bang (and, if I recall correctly, they were 'outside' of it witnessing it, which means Q's powers transcend the very reality they were originally a species of), could will people in and out of existence and all other matter of seemingly omnipotent feats.

However, in The Q and the Grey, the Voyager crew use the Q weapons against the Q, implying that the most powerful tools available to the Q are independent of themselves (not innate, like a God) and can be interacted with by any physical being. So this raises a bunch of questions:

1) Do the Q still have innate powers in addition to their weapons? If not, how did Quinn manage to use the Q weapons despite being exiled? If so, how do they compare?

2) Where are these weapons/tools located?

3) Does this extend to all (seemingly) omnipotent Star Trek races?

4) Are the Q physical entities using these weapons from a remote location, or have they 'transcended' beyond physical form? If the latter, how did Q intend to incorporate physical DNA into a non-physical entity.

I'm sure a lot of these questions are unanswerable, but the Q were always one of my favorite species and I hated the treatment they got on Voyager and thought maybe there's some canonical explanations I've overlooked for some of these questions. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I understand this is an Alpha, so please don't confuse this with complaining - I'm just genuinely curious to know if there's more to the game than I'm seeing.

So far, I've just run around an empty landscape, occasionally bumping into other players who do very little before wandering off. I have played for 40 minutes and have encountered two zombies - both of which just stood still clawing at the air. This was on two different servers. Every house I explore seems completely empty, there is next to nothing to interact with except for looting bodies (which means nothing because there are no zombies to use the loot against) and opening doors.

I understand I have to eat and drink, but I don't really want to play a game that revolves around wandering aimlessly until I'm thirsty.

I thought maybe the zombies would get more aggressive the more I played, but that makes little sense considering I'm playing on shared servers of 40 people.

Are these just garbage servers? Or is this a common first experience with Dayz?

I fully intend to give it another shot tomorrow, but I'm still just not sure what to expect - if anything. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey fitness.

I started running a month and a bit back to get into shape. At first, I would do one hour sessions with great physical difficulty, but no real mental difficulty. However, after the initial 'feel good' of finally getting into exercise wore off, I started to get really bored while running. I used to go just about every day of the week for an hour, now, while I still get out for a run every day, some sessions are as short as 10 minutes. I just start counting the minutes, completely mind numbingly bored. I still look FORWARD to running each day, so my motivation is still there somewhere, it's just when I'm actually on my run that I just want it to end.

Tried listening to music, but I find it gives me headaches having my earphones in for extended periods every damn day, and music isn't really something I can listen to unless I'm in the mood to really get into an album anyway.

tl;dr: Running is boring, how do I keep myself from going braindead through extended sessions. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What are the best movies that deal with the possibilities of Alien life? I'm looking for stuff that isn't quite so focused on horror or action, although I wouldn't be against that sort of stuff.

To give an idea, stuff like Contact that deals more with the impact a discovery like that would have on society, or 2001: ASO that keeps the aliens more 'mysterious'. But really, any suggestions are fine. Preferably obscure as I've likely already seen all the bigger stuff. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> How would you feel about this change to Midas? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-11-30 03:01:57 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I've read a couple of posts about nerfing Midas considering it's current popularity, but I'd rather not see the item itself get a direct nerf. Instead, how would you feel about the following changes:

* Midas now limited to two per game per team
* Store starts with one Midas
* A new Midas is made available 8 minutes after the first is purchased the first

The effects of the change: No more Midas gaming. You now have to decide which two of your heroes get the benefit of Midas, encouraging more team decision making. Additionally, the timing of your team's first Midas affects how quickly you can get your second Midas, making first Midas timing more crucial.

What other changes could be made instead? Or is Midas overrated and not actually in need of a nerf (just another fad)? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Can someone explain what the "Deep Web" is? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-11-28 09:43:37 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I just finished reading this post
http://forum.bodybuilding.com/showthread.php?t=132837823

now I've heard of the Deep Web before, but I always just assumed it was nothing more than a general term for website that were overlooked by search engines due to being low priority, however the post has confused my understanding of it.

So what exactly is the 'deep web' and how can I access it? Also, are the claims about the Deep Web in that post accurate? Especially the stuff about being watched by authorities? It makes it sound like every user of the Deep Web is some shady hacker or nutjob who will just randomly aim to ruin my life for simply browsing the web. Like an Internet Cartel or something... </TEXT>

	<TITLE> What kind of quality control does Valve have for Tournaments? </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So, with all the drama of the Netolic league and previous leagues reportedly not fully paying their casters, item creators or rewards to teams (TPL), I got to wondering what kind of quality control Valve has for tournaments. 

Ticket sales are obviously a huge source of revenue for tournament organizers, so I imagine a lot of this drama would end if Valve were to be a bit harsher on organizers mishandling tournaments. Does anyone know how easy it is to get a tournament ticket into the Valve store and what kind of regulation they have in place? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [Idea] Gems that track records rather than totals. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-11-26 10:16:58 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Here's an idea: gems that track records for single games instead of cumulative values. Throw a "Most Last Hits" or "Quickest BattleFury" gem on any of Antimage's items and keep track of your records. If you break your record, it could be informed to everyone on the scoreboard at the end of the game. There are, of course, some obvious downsides such as people deliberately drawing games out in order to beat old records, so maybe some care would have to be taken when selecting types of records to track in order to prevent the system being gamed.

For fun, some more examples:

Weaver: Lowest HP on timelapse

Pudge: Best Hook Hit to Miss Ratio (must throw at least 15 hooks in the game), Most Self Denies

Bounty Hunter: Most track gold

General: Most Kills, Assists, Roshan's, wards placed, etc in a single game, quickest time to hit level 25, least kills in a game you won, Most last hits in first x minutes of game, quickest time to take a tower, quickest time to win a game

and so on. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Question about "Midas Gaming" </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-11-25 03:22:16 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Currently watching Speed Gaming VS DK Game 2 (slight spoilers) and I'm currently looking at 6 Midas' in the game right now.

Why is a 14 minute Midas on Alchemist acceptable in this patch? Why is  Midas a priority for supports instead of quick Mek's? I understand Midas' being more popular in the current patch because higher passive gold means you can reliably get it sooner and more quickly recover your forgone early game after getting a Midas, but is the passive gold gain really enough to explain getting multiple Midas' on the same team and getting Midas' as late as we're seeing?

Are there other aspects of this patch that benefit mass Midas? </TEXT>
