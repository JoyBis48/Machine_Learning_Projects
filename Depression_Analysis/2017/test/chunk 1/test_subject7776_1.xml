	<TITLE> How do I stop the thoughts? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2012-09-01 00:41:15 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> During school I am perfectly fine, I laugh (Well... giggle), smile, and am generally a positive person. I get all my work done in class, I never have homework, I help out people when asked. I try my best to just help. But when I get home I am instantly having suicidal thoughts, I fight with my girlfriend, and I just overall hate everything.

I feel like I'm just a horrible person, I believe I have let my father down. He wanted a smart child who likes what he is into, But I'm not smart in my eyes, and I don't like sports and NASCAR and all of that stuff, I tried to play sports to please him but after I cracked my head I said "I don't want to play sports again" and I haven't. I like games, and girls...
I've never heard my parents say "I love you." I know its hard to believe but I just haven't. They don't go out on dates, or kiss or anything. I feel like its my fault.
People think, "Oh Travis, You have it was easy you get what you want and can do whatever."
But getting what I want isn't fine. My parents do not have a college savings account for me, nor my brother. My brother (who is smart) got a little bit of a scholarship and it makes it easy for him to go. I, however will not get a scholarship, I don't get 100% on tests and I don't do the best work.
So, I don't know what I'll do for college. I don't want my family to take out another loan. I would like my parents to just go out on dates, and act like a married couple.
I take medicine but the dosage seems to be too small, if I take 2 I'm happy all day and everything is fine.
I noticed myself getting depressed after a break-up, I tried so hard to make everything up and talk to her, I wrote a 6 page letter to her, and she just ignored it. Awhile later I had tried to search our home for a pistol we keep for safety. I searched often when no one was home and could never find it, and I'd usually end up sitting on the bed and crying.
On my birthday, sadly, I had tried to OD. My birthday wasn't good.

I don't want to die, and I don't want to have these thoughts, but they won't leave me alone. I just want to have my parents be a couple, I want my my father to say hes proud of me, And I want to be happy.

Help? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So we were playing Day Z (7 of us) and we were in an open field checking a deer stand (of course it had nothing), we heard a shot and one of us died, we all proned down and DC'd. (Yes wussy move, wanna fight about it?) We reconnected to a new server and messed around in the field recollecting ourselves and healing our injured. The moment we were all ready to go we heard another shot and again, another friend got shot and died. We all hit the deck and now we're just waiting it all out.

Now I'm scared. </TEXT>
