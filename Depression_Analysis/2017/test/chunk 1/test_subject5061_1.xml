	<TEXT> Unfortunately, until our election process changes, you can't have both.

Why is that?

Unless you accept and support allowing only eligible voters to vote then you do not care about fair elections and only seek an advantage for the Left. At least be honest that you are only for laws that help get Democrats elected.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It is no more a cesspool than what is seen on Reddit comments. I find it truly fascinating at the worldview and grasp of reality of the Left and the Right. It is as if both sides are living in parallel universes and experiencing different realities. What that means is that one entire half of the US is either dumb, delusional, or in a cult like trance. 

It is scary that aside from politics, the very fabric of reality is disputed by the two sides.    </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Nice job (I mean it) but you are confusing the terms Conservative (capital C) and conservative (lower case C). The two are not the same.

This is also true with Liberals as opposed to liberals

The Tea Party are Conservatives who are interested in being conservative regarding giving power to the government. That does not mean they are conservative in all things social or science.

A Liberal is a Leftist. That is different from a small L liberal who is a person who favors government ensuring the rights of all. JFK was a liberal. Obama is a Liberal

Why would the Republicans embrace ANY policy that would:

1. Attract a tiny minority of voters (Voters for whom racism is at the very top of their requirements in a candidate)

2. Anger and offend the vast majority of the voting public?

It makes no logical sense to do so. Can you imagine a party adopting a policy of "We are the party of pedophiles"?

The Left has lied about Republicans and their alleged embrace of racism.

	<TEXT> Political parties do evolve over time. 

What my point is is that Liberals like to view American politics as The Republican Party was "good" when Lincoln was president and the Democrats were less so. At some magical moment, the two parties switched and the Democrats became "good" and the Republicans decided to become evil and embrace racism.

Unfortunately the facts don't prove that wishful thinking.

Both parties have evolved over time. Both parties have embraced bigger government to various extents. Both have evolved in how they view the role of government.

There has never been a magical shift of the parties in terms of "good" and "bad" nor has there been a shift in the parties' overtly racist policies.

The Democrat Party refuted racism in the 60's and 70's. The Republicans never embraced racism as a policy.

There was no ideological shift.
  
That is not a "shift" in terms of the GOP embracing racism as the Democrats had done for 150 years prior.

The GOP never embraced racism. The Democrats simply stopped supporting overt racism in the 60's and 70's

	<TEXT> Wrong. I have read all of the links provided and commented on them. Several have been good in explaining various flows of each parties' evolving policies and positions.

What those links have failed to do is show a shift of racist policies from the Democrats to the GOP. The Democrats have historically been a party that embraced overt racism for over 150 years. It was only in the 60's and the 70's when the Democrats refuted overt racism. 

Simply because the Democrats refuted overt racism in the 60's and 70's does not mean that the GOP embraced racism as a political strategy.

	<TEXT> Thank you for the links. The Live Science was interesting as it explains a bit about how at the turn of the 20th century and into the FDR administration, both parties embraced bigger government. Certainly the rise of revolutionary Communism after WWI further motivated governments fearful of revolution, to expand government programs. 

The article does not explain a switching of racist attitudes (or the switching of party platforms) from the Democrats to the GOP as has been claimed in the comments of the post. 

Thank you also for the Hufpo article. It was informative and a good read.  That article showed how both parties evolved politically to match society's evolution regarding social issues during the turn of the 20th century. The article did a good job until it made a jump to the 60's and tried to connect the two periods as being a profound shift in which the Democrat Party refuted racism and the GOP embraced it. In that aspect the article failed. 

Interestingly, this article supports the recent evolution of the GOP that once supported bigger government being influenced by the Tea Party to reduce the size of government. Political parties eventually evolve with the will of the voters.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The Southern Strategy is often misunderstood. It is based on an interview decades ago by Republican Lee Atwater. 

In the interview, Atwater stated that the GOP could use economic issues to attract southern Democrat "Dixiecrat" voters who felt they were being abandoned by the Democrat Party's shift to the Left away from traditional American values. 

The interview featured him stating that the GOP could use economic issues not just racist appeals of "nigger nigger". This quote is often edited and claimed to prove that the GOP had a formal strategy of adopting overt racism in order to capture the votes of racist southerners.

If one listens to the interview, they will see that the claim of an embrace of racism by the GOP is not what Attwater is saying.

Demographic studies have shown that there was not a sudden shift of Dixiecrat voter away from the Democrat Party to the GOP after the Civil Rights acts of the 60's. The migration of Democrats to the GOP in the south has been a gradual movement over 30 years. This migration was due to a belief that the Democrat Party was abandoning them by moving to the Left politically and rejecting American values. It was not due to racism.

http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2013/04/the-southern-strategy-debunked-again.php

The logical question remains: why would a major political party  adopt a policy of racism given that voters for which racism is an important political issue is minute and the the number of voters who would be offended by such a policy is huge? 

In other words it is illogical for a political party intent on winning nation elections to embrace any position in which the benefits are tiny and the negatives are huge. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When she applied for the teaching positions in Texas and at Harvard she was asked about Native American heritage. The question of Native American heritage often comes up in employment. 

Because too many whites claim Indian heritage when they are really not Native American, the questionnaires she filled out qualified how that question could be answered.

The questionnaires stated that a subjective belief was not enough to claim Native American heritage. What was needed was acceptance or affiliation with a recognized Indian tribe.

She was not identified by any tribe as a member nor did she maintain any tribal affiliation yet she answered the employment question in the affirmative anyway. She lied

She also lied about her answer and tried to pull a cover up regarding the whole issue.

She lied and plagiarized several recipes in a book called "Powwow Chow" 

Her husband, also not an Indian, penned a recipe for that book and he also falsely claimed to be of Indian heritage.

 So you see, lying has been a regular aspect of her personality and of her lack of respect for rules

The Koch bros are not the running the GOP and have NO influence over the Tea Party. They are free to support any policies they wish but that has no bearing on how the Right votes.

What is an "anti atheist law". I am a Conservative and an atheist and I have never herd that term before.

There is no political will in this country to ban or seriously curtail abortions. That is a dead issue that the Left brings up to demonize the GOP.

Reagan's war on drugs? Are you serious? Do you realize that Reagan was president 30 years ago?

Obama supported DOMA as did Hillary Clinton.

For that reason alone it should be dismantled.

We should return to the previous system and create a system for the truly needy so that they can receive adequate healthcare.

Costs are much higher unless one is very poor and heavily subsidized.

	<TEXT> You are obviously confused and lumping Marxism, socialism, Naziism etc into a polyglot of isms. Marxism IS a form of socialism as is Naziism but although they share many key points they also differ in important ways.

You really should study the history of socialism in Germany during the turn of the 20th century. It is a fascinating period in which many socialist philosophers explored various types of socialism in search of the best and most equitable form.

With that said, you make the mistake of confusing the meaning of "control over the means of production". That term incorporates actual ownership such as a nationalized industries, coercive control over industries, and it includes crony capitalism in which certain favored corporations are given exclusivity and non favored corporations are excluded.

Hitler was a devout socialist and not an opportunist that simply attached himself to the term. He wrote extensively on the virtues of socialism and  even founded what became the German Socialist Workers Party.

Please expand your scholarly investigations beyond wikipedia. The study of socialism is a fascinating and diverse exploration into human attempts at optimum organizational systems

    The Nazis were against Capitalism.

No they were not - that is just an outright untruth.

Really? Let's look at the primary sources, the Program of the National Socialist German Workers Party (Nazi) itself: http://www.stephenhicks.org/2009/10/26/appendix-1-nsdap-party-program-nietzsche-and-the-nazis/

A few keys points of that program:

"Point 11 calls for the abolition of all income gained by loaning money at interest.

Point 12 demands the confiscation of all profits earned by German businesses during World War I.

Point 13 demands the nationalization of all corporations.

Point 14 demands profit-sharing in large industrial enterprises.

Point 15 demands the generous development of state-run old-age insurance.

Point 16 calls for the immediate socialization of the huge department stores. "



 And here is a quote from Adolf Hitler in a speech in 1927: We are socialists, we are enemies of todays capitalistic economic system for the exploitation of the economically weak, with its unfair salaries, with its unseemly evaluation of a human being according to wealth and property instead of responsibility and performance, and we are all determined to destroy this system under all conditions.

Here is a quote from Josef Goebbels: The worker in a capitalist stateand that is his deepest misfortuneis no longer a living human being, a creator, a maker. He has become a machine. A number, a cog in the machine without sense or understanding. He is alienated from what he produces.[

http://www.stephenhicks.org/2009/12/04/economic-socialism-not-capitalism-section-8-of-nietzsche-and-the-nazis/

These quotes were just what I googled in 10 seconds worth of research. 

Your claim that the Nazis were Capitalists or supported Capitalism is thus proven False. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The Nazis were against Capitalism. They "controlled" not owned the means of production.

The Nazis were against the Communists because they viewed them as competitors. Hitler also felt that international Communism contained too many Jews as members. Communism was internationally focused while Naziism was more nationalistic. 

Denmark has some socialist policies but it is a different form of socialism than Naziism. Also the Nazis and the Fascists (both socialists) were distinct in that Fascism did not involve the extreme racism and  antisemitism of Naziism.

Naziism and Fascism are often incorrectly lumped together as the same system. They were not. The confusion results from the Soviets lumping the two systems together in propaganda during WWII.  </TEXT>

Turn off the religious part of your brain and just weight the facts.

If fracking methods and fossil fuel usage were technologically advanced to the point that we could guarantee that no environmental damage ever occurred, would you  accept fracking and the use of fossil fuels?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Speculation. We don't know what chemicals they use and in what amounts because they have fought and won to keep them secret.

No, we do know exactly what happens to those chemicals because deep well waste injections have been done for a hundred years. The chemicals and the water react with iron ore in the soil and transform into iron oxide, rust essentially. This is chemistry 101 stuff.

You are trying to bring your environmentalism, your religion, your philosophical aversion to fossil fuels into a scientific factual discussion. 

Unless you have divested your lifestyle from the benefits of fossil fuels then you are just not being a credible advocate. 

Note: I fully embrace the day when we can utilize totally clean energy. That is definitely our goal and or destiny. We simply need to allow the science to develop. Shooting ourselves in the foot by stopping  the use of fossil fuels prematurely is  philosophically satisfying but realistically naive and harmful.  </TEXT>
