I flirted with a teacher I had a crush on all through school, convinced we had chemistry. 
Ran into him about 2 years after I graduated and ended up taking him home. 
I fucking knew it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh I should specify that this approach is for "cold call" type situations where you don't have a lot of time. E.g. The cute girl/guy on the bus. Obviously if you lock eyes in a bar or something have a chat to see if you actually get along.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The best pick up line is:
"Hello, I think you are really pretty. Here is my number. If you would like to call me sometime I'd like to hear from you."
Then walk away.
Make sure the number is written down, don't try to get them to put it in their phone. This way she doesn't have to reject you if she's not interested and she can call or message you at her leisureif she is. It's forward and polite without being creepy.  </TEXT>
