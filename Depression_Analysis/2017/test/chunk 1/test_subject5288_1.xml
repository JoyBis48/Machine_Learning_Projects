**Disclaimer to moderators:**
Slight OT is fine, but when users decide to act stupid they should be dealt with with the appropriate means - its really annoying for me when OT turns crazy. Please put the warning/ban hammer anytime any of you think there's lack of respect and/or too much unwanted OT crap - but if it doesn't meet this criteria let the OT posts alone. Thank you.

Cheers! </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [APK Teardown] Google Search 50.2 hints at the coming of Project Food, will make you a sandwich when you say the phrase "OK Google, make me a sandwich", a few bug fixes, and a lot more. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-01-24 13:11:48 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Google's developers took a couple of weeks off for the holidays  or from my perspective, they gave me a couple of weeks to rest  but now they're back and it's time for the app updates to resume. Naturally, it's time to breathe life back into the teardowns, and we're back with a  VERY big one. Google Search v50.2 began rolling out to users yesterday, and we've already seen quite a few HUGE adjustments and improvements. After plenty of digging, a stack of additional changes have surfaced, including one that is already live, and several more just waiting for some finishing touches including the much awaited **Project Food**. 
             **Disclaimer**: Teardowns are, by their nature, speculative and based on incomplete evidence. It's possible that the guesses made here are totally and completely wrong. There is always a chance that details may change or plans may be cancelled prior to launch of a new feature. As with all rumors, nothing is certain until it's officially announced.
        
* **'Ok Google Make me a Sandwich'**
By far, this is the biggest feature Google has implemented. This is the first step to Google's ambitious 'Project Food'.  Just say the phrase "OK Google, Make me a sandwich" and lo, your sandwich will be made by your mobile! This will, according to Google, go a long way in providing free food to everyone.

* **Excitement for the future**
There are subtle hints dropped for us to see that Project Food is about to come. For example, when we saw the code, there was a line which mentioned, "OK Google, make me a burger." This probably means that Project Food will cover a variety of foods, ranging from burgers to sandwiches. 
Here is the code we observed
     string name="search_pref_header""OK Google, Make me a burger"/string
     string name="search_bluetooth_pref_title"Make a burger/string
     string name="search_headset_pref_title"BURGER BURGER!/string
     string name="search_headsets_confirmation_title"BURGER PROCESSING!/string
     string name="search_headsets_confirmation_body"YOUR BURGER IS READY TO EAT!!!!!/string


*  **Wrap-Up**
* That's about it for this teardown. It's clear Google is preparing quite a few changes for the coming months, and there's definitely something for everybody on this list. It's only January, and there's already a lot showing up in the Search app, so by the time I/O rolls around, most of this list will probably be live and we'll have a whole new set of foods to eat. I think it's going to be a good year for food junkies.
