I've been in meds for about a year but I've stopped going to therapy because I didn't feel that I needed it anymore. I'm happy but I hate school. I guess there's no point to this post I just wanted to talk to some people who have been through something similar maybe.  </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2013-04-10 20:00:38 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So i've been on lexapro for a few months and in the past couple weeks i got real lazy on taking it at the same time, which led to me missing days and eventually just not taking it when I ran out. I started skipping or cancelling my therapy sessions during this time as well. I think it's because of this that I let my school work slip and now I am failing all my classes. IT all culminated in a breakdown on thursday where i really wasnt sure what I was going to do. Suicide kept racing through my mind so instead I went on a long drive to try and gather my thoughts. In my car I found some papers from my therapy sessions and i read "Is the way you're thinking now going to help your situation"? Suddenly a light went off and I realized I needed to be an adult. So i've been back on the meds for a week and feel so much better. My only problem now is school, which my parents paid for. I plan to tell them very soon that I messed up school because I got off my meds. I'm going to offer to pay them back for this semester and pay for all subsequent schooling my self. I'm also prepared to give my car back to them. I work and pay for my own housing in a city where I dont need a car, so i think i can make it without the car and on my own if i have too. I might have to take a year off school for academic probation which is really scary to me. Has anyone been in a similar situation? I'm just wondering if what im doing is the right and responsible thing. I feel like it is since i was doing well on the meds and I screwed myself over by getting off. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Today I finally told my dad about all the mental problems I've had my whole life. I get stressed and depressed super easily, always feel anxious and have panic attacks and I know I've gotten more withdrawn as years go by. I can't keep up with school and work because I get overwhelmed and give up. I've been sent to therapy twice, once after my parents divorce and after I was kicked out of my universitys housing for paraphernalia charges. I never talked to the therapy either time and i'm really nervous about it. I've never opened up emotionally to anyone before and i'm scared I won't be able to. And what if I do and they tell me i'm just lazy and everything is my fault. Sorry if this is long and doesn't make sense. I would just like to heat from someone who has been in this situation. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Tips for pot smoking freshman. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2012-08-30 18:00:33 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I was kicked out of kerr for paraphernalia my freshman year and I would like to offer incoming freshman some tips.

1 Never, ever, ever leave anything in your car. That's how I got caught. Dogs can smell a one hitter in your car.
 
2 Never leave anything in your dorm.
 
3 Make friends off campus and stash your pieces there. This is the easiest and best thing to do.
 
4 Avoid campus when you're riding dirty, especially north Texas avenue. Campus police love pulling people over.
 
5 If you are caught you will be kicked out of  the dorms, so be prepared. You will also have to go through substance abuse counseling.

6 smoke joints. They leave no evidence.

7 Avoid bike cops. They are the worst.

Feel free to post your advice here or ask questions. I want to help as many people as I can avoid what I went through. </TEXT>
