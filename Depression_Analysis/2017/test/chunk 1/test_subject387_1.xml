	<TEXT> I know an older guy who took things personally after losing to a young "showboater" and decided to start a real fight to which the instructors stopped before it could happen and banned him from the school. I was wondering if anyone else has ever seen or been in this type of situation and what the outcome was.

	<TITLE> How likely is a wrist-grab defense maneuver going to be useful in a hostile situation? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-02-21 11:02:00 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Like, how likely would it be viable. What're the chances that your wrist is going to be grabbed at some point so that you can put your attacker into a wrist lock?

At my old Taekwondo school, we practiced more than 20 different variations of wrist locks that all involved your opponent grabbing your wrist and you using a type of arm/wrist/shoulder lock to defend yourself.

At my current Taekwondo school, when I asked about my current Master about why we don't practice wrist locks, he said that the only person that's going to grab your wrist is a Cop and that it'd be more beneficial to be spending time on actual fight training rather than "One-Step or Self Defense Techniques." 

Is it bad that my Taekwondo dojang doesn't teach wrist-grab defense or is that skill just not very useful as say knowing how to kick properly? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Why so much hate on kids earning their black belts? (Please read before downvoting) </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-02-07 06:22:21 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Clearly, in many Karate   Taekwondo schools among all others, we see a large amount of children earning their black belts. If the student has sufficiently demonstrated knowledge and skill that a black belt is required and expected to have, what is the problem with promoting them? A Black Belt doesn't mean that you're able to defend yourself in any situation possible, but it does mean you're able to perform the appropriate techniques and forms that you should've mastered by that level. 

Hell, this [7 year old girl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65QCHZDXKmA spfreload=10), who is also a Black Belt, performs forms with precision, spirit, and technique way better than many adults I've seen (even adults with Black Belts). Maybe even better than people on this subreddit.

Just because they are children does not mean that they are incapable of having good technique and the skill that a Black Belt is expected to have.

In my own opinion, I believe "Junior" Black Belts would be more appropriate for children and that they should be required to reach a reasonable age before testing for an Adult Black Belt. But, I still don't understand the ridiculous amounts of criticism against Kids with Black Belts. 

The most ridiculous thing I've heard is how "a school with kids running around with black belts is *most definitely* a McDojo." So you're saying that the girl in the video above was trained at a McDojo? Unlikely.

In my opinion, the amount of young students who have Black Belts at any given school should not give alarm that the school, itself, is a McDojo. Critique them on their technique and skill, not on their age.

Again, that young girl in the video above has demonstrated Kata/Form much better than a lot of grown men I've seen.

Children are clearly capable of having such skill that is expected of a Black Belt.

Merlyn: ...Because after I leave, you'll test it and after you confirm that it *is* his blood, you'll exhaust yourself with conspiracy theories as to how I planted it or how it's all a lie. And after enough time passes, you'll be left with one inescapable truth - that Oliver Queen is dead.

Thanks to Merlyn we just saved a few episodes where Felicity could've potentially went through a bunch of time trying to confirm that it is Oliver's blood then exhausting herself with conspiracy theories as to how Merlyn planted it or how it's just a lie. And after maybe 2-3 episodes she'd finally start coming to terms with Oliver Queen's death.

Damn, Merlyn must've watched a lot of Asian dramas to point out all these clichs.

John Barrowman is such a great actor.

	<TITLE> Does "Sport" Martial Arts training translate to Self-Defense training, naturally? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-01-20 10:28:37 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> For example, does the average Judo Dojo address how to defend against a striker or does it just solely teach sport Judo with throws?

I've tried out a Judo/Jiu-Jitsu school once that claimed to teach "Self-Defense" (as many martial arts schools do nowadays) but only taught throws while completely neglecting how to get in position for a throw in no-gi and how to set-up a throw when an opponent is coming in with kicks and punches. Basically, they just slapped on the "Self-Defense" logo on their Sport Judo training.

I've had the same scenario with Taekwondo. The dojang I go to claims to teach "Self-Defense" but all I learned was how to spar under "Olympic Taekwondo rules" which is does not accurately simulate real fighting scenarios.

Do the training in schools that primarily focus on training for tournaments (like Taekwondo, Judo, maybe even BJJ) naturally translate into real life self-defense even if you aren't given instruction on how to do so?

For example, I don't think someone who solely practices Olympic Taekwondo sparring would be very adept in defending themselves against punches or chokeholds.

Another example would be Kyokushin. Kyokushin Karate is a great martial art, but it does not cover Face Punches at all in it's sparring, so how can Kyokushin practitioners be conditioned/expected to take/defend against punches if all they train in is Kyokushin sparring? Unless they're naturally gifted, talented, or have training in doing so, they can't be expected to do so.


Would someone that only trains under "sport/tournament" rulesets be able to effectively defend themselves in a hostile situation?

EDIT: I'm actually considering taking Kung-Fu San Soo which primarily focuses on "No Rules, Street Self-Defense" on the side to supplement my Martial Arts training as all the training I've ever had has only been practiced under rulesets. On the street, there are no rules. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Does a fighter's bodyfat/physique have more to do with genetics than training and diet? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-01-20 08:10:43 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> MMA Training is very vigorous, especially to high level athletes, however many manage to go through all that Cardio and manage to still have a significant amount of bodyfat on them. I've always wondered if that had more to do with genetics because obviously, leading up to a fight, a fighter will be on a healthy, clean diet along with an intense training regimen to prepare them for what's to come.

However, I noticed people like BJ Penn or Daniel Cormier (no Fried Chicken jokes please) always seem to carry stubborn bodyfat on them despite the weight cut. Is it just very difficult for some people to reach a low percentage of bodyfat (ripped physique, six pack) than other people? Like are there other factors to it?

It's just hard for me to wrap my mind around how people like Roy Nelson can go through an intense training regime and still manage to be fat.

Excuse the stupid question, it's just something I've always wondered. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Is there really any benefit in training "pre-set" Knife Defense maneuvers? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-01-15 04:31:54 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Basically preempts where one guy jabs with a knife, you block then grab, go for some sort of lock, trip, or throw and then disarm or where you attempt to hit the knife out there hand, etc.

Obviously in real life, things would not go so smoothly and one cannot predict which direction the knife will come at them nor can they think that fast before they inevitably get struck at in a hostile situation where the attacker is motivated to strike.

However, I believe training and experience is better than no training and experience but I can't possibly imagine someone being able to react fast enough in a real life hostile scenario to defend themselves against a knife attack even with obtained muscle memory.  Hostile situations with a knife are unpredictable and a lot of schools teach pre-set movements, one steps, if you will.

I'd love to hear your guys' opinions on the teachings of pre-set knife defense maneuvers and what purpose/benefit they have, if there is any.

In real life, those one-steps more than likely won't go down as smoothly as how you practice: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsLkqwQrCS8

EDIT: In my opinion, with practicing with a "live" training partner on knife defense would be the best way to go about it when going about it at all.  There's no guaranteed way to protect yourself in a hostile situation and it's usually best to try and escape rather than fight back.  However, if it's a life or death scenario and you know you could possibly die whether you're being compliant with the attacker or not, you want to have a good fighting chance and I think "live" training with knife defense would benefit someone more than pre-set movements. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I would first like to point off that I am not a Wing Chun practitioner.

I noticed in a lot of Wing Chun drills, they tend to practice what is known as a "Sticky Hand" drill where they start off with one hand touching the other partner's hand and they keep trapping and blocking until one person manages to get off the chain punches.

Eventually, one gets very good at doing this but is this a practical method of training for someone that might not end up fighting another Wing Chun practitioner? Obviously, in a fight against another style, the fight doesn't start with the hands touching and one might not be able to pull off all the intricate traps and blocks that they practice. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Why does it seem like young kids can achieve a high level of flexibility so effortlessly? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-11-14 13:25:55 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I've been focusing hard on stretching for quite a long time and I have yet been able to do a high side kick, yet I see young children be able to do seemingly effortlessly without having to work much on their flexibility. It's as if they are naturally more flexible. Is their a reason behind this?

And also, is it possible for an adult to achieve the high level of flexibility that a child can obtain? 

This is my goal: http://www.changstaekwondo.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Changs-Taekwondo-Flexibility.jpg

It just seems extremely difficult to achieve. I can go as high as above the body, and to the face in real-time. But to hold a side kick that high is difficult for me. Any tips? </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Aang could demolish an entire fleet, Roku demolished an entire palace, Yangchen could move an entire forest with just the Avatar-State Enhanced Airbending, Kyoshi could move fucking Islands.

Korra just shot a long stream of air and lifted a big rock. Was the Avatar State REALLY necessary to do that? It should be able to do **MUCH** much more than just blast a strong burst of air and lift a big rock. Aang could do that at 12 without the Avatar State and he never managed to fully master the elements during the war.

Every scene in which Korra accesses the Avatar State aside from finale Boss Battles has been ridiculously lackluster. Remember Aang in the desert, or against the Earth General who tried to force him into the Avatar State? Korra just doesn't compare. She turns on the Avatar State and gets wiped aside by Dark Spirits or some shit.

Also, in a battle against Combustion Man, Aang straight blasted through a Mountain (and this was after almost getting killed by Azula AND losing access to the Avatar State) whereas Korra gets slammed aside by a rock by Kuvira.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I kick significantly higher when I'm kicking at real-time/fast. 

But, when I'm doing it slower to focus and practice technique, I can't kick nearly as high.

For EX: I can do a High Sidekick to the face if I'm doing it in real-time, but if I'm just trying to focus on form and doing it slow-I can only go as high as the body.

There has to be a logical explanation to this. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Okay, so, today is sparring day.  But, I had just finished up some late night classes (I have class from 9-6 PM on Wednesdays) so I was too worn to fight after taking five consecutive exams.  I figured I could just go to practice and watch just to see if I could pick-up something, so I headed off to my Taekwondo dojang right after I left campus.  I ended up showing to class pretty early so I just chilled and waited on the benches after the kids class was over.  The adult class began 30 min. after so I had time to just relax.  

A White Belt, whom I haven't met before, was also on the bench so I decided to make conversation with him.  I asked him if he was planning on competing in the upcoming tournament and he told me he's been having some issues lately and that he isn't where he wants to be (sparring-wise) to enter a tournament.  So, since we had time to kill before class, I decided to try and help the guy out with his sparring by teaching him some combinations he can throw. (EX: Roundhouse Kick set-up followed up with a Back Kick/Spinning Heel Kick) The Master took a seat and watched us for a bit before he started class when a couple other people showed up.

We ended up working for a good 20 minutes before two more guys showed up and class began.  (Tournament is on Friday so a lot of our competitors are taking it easy these last few days before their fights, that's why not many people showed up) Though I was planning on just sitting this practice out, I figured I should join in (didn't bring a uniform so I was just in T-Shirt and Jeans lol) to give the White Belt, we'll call him Jackie, a good practice and so that the two Black Belts could spend time training with each other to prepare for the tournament.

We did some warm-ups, then some basic kicking drills on the hogus, and then finally we started some sparring.  I decided that I would do some light-contact with Jackie just so he could get the opportunity to apply the techniques we discussed and practiced before practice.

So, when it was our turn to spar, I just played defense and baited Jackie to lure out those combinations he practiced earlier.  He ended up landing a lot of the combinations, and I was very impressed.  However, my Master started commenting on my technique and how I wasn't striking back when I had the opportunity to and etc. etc..  (I thought it was obvious why since I was a Blue Belt and he's a White Belt, I wanted to match him at his own level but I wanted to also give him time to get comfortable with using attacks in combination)

I ended up getting lectured a bit on how I was doing and the Master referred to us as "around the same level of skill." I was a bit disappointed because I thought the Master knew I was going easy on the guy, since I was a higher belt and I originally had intention of practicing today like I told him before class started.  It seemed as if he believes that how I was sparring was actually how I sparred Made me feel kind of upset, I guess.

So after class, I told the Master that I was going slower than usual because I wanted to give Jackie the opportunity to practice what we talked about before practice and the Master commented that he was surprised to see Jackie land a couple of those moves.  He thanked me for helping Jackie out and said I could make a good coach someday.

That said, I'm still not entirely certain whether or not he knew/believed that I was quite easier than usual.  Makes me feel eh. /:

What do you guys think? It's been bothering me a bit since the car ride home.

**tl;dr: Went easy on a beginner and got critiqued for it.  I feel like my Master thinks that I was actually giving it my all because he criticized how I wasn't hitting at every open opportunity I had. (When I was really going easy on purpose so the beginner could have a chance at scoring on me)  So, basically, I think he thinks I suck despite me having trained for quite awhile compared to the beginner.**

**Update: Thank you very much everyone for your comments.** </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Regarding Belts and Skill-Level for Tournaments </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-10-25 06:33:31 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I know some schools tend to "lie" about their competitors' age and belt level so that they would have an edge over competition.  But that got me thinking, since in a lot of schools grading/testing is up to the student what if someone decided to remain a white belt/lower belt for a very long time?  That would give them a ridiculous edge amongst lower belts that have just gotten their rank/haven't been training as long after they've received their belt in competition.

Is there any way to judge where someone should be at in competition? My Master offered to change my birthdate and suggest that I compete at a lower belt level than where I'm at so that I could have a better chance at winning my next competition.  The whole thing seems very shady.

I recall my Master telling me about a tournament in which a White Belt was using Spinning Heel Kicks, Back Kicks, and other various advanced kicks at a high degree of flexibility.  Either that was a Martial Arts prodigy, or they weren't actually a white belt.  (My Master believes the latter.)

Any thoughts and opinions on this topic? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Regarding weight training and cutting weight for tournaments. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-10-19 07:56:40 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hey /r/martialartists. I have a big question regarding weight training and cutting for tournaments. Right now I'm a pretty skinny individual and I've been trying to bulk up and gain some muscle. I've bulked up ~15 lbs since I first started weight training and a trainer recommended I at least get up to 165 lbs (I'm 142-5 lbs rn) before I even think about cutting just because I don't have enough muscle mass on me yet to make an efficient cut.

However, for an upcoming tournament I would have to cut down to 125-135 lbs if I want to have an even fight.

The time frame from here till the upcoming tournament (Jan) isn't enough for me to bulk efficiently to put on more muscle, which is my goal.

Doing martial arts already makes it difficult enough to put on weight but it's recommended that I don't try to put on weight because I'll be slower and outclassed in sparring.

I've been told by /r/fitness that if I cut right now, since I don't have much muscle mass, I'll look like an anorexic twig. I'll likely be much weaker as well.

I'm conflicted over if I should continue to bulk and if I should cut for tournaments.

Pros of Bulking and weight training is that I'll be able to put on more muscle and gain strength.

Downside is that I'll likely be somewhat slower and if I do manage to get to 165 and decide to spar at that weight division, at my 5'8'' height, I'll likely be sparring with guys 6'' and over. 

Pros of Cutting is that I'll be lighter and more agile and quicker. I'll also likely get an even match-up at a tournament as well. Someone closer to my height and reach.

Downside is that I'll be terribly skinny and weak if I drop to 125 with the amount of muscle I currently have right now. 

I definitely don't think I'll look like Bruce Lee or even come close to the strength he had if I drop from 145 to 125. (Since Bruce was 5'7.5''   125 lbs by the end of Enter the Dragon) He had a ripped physique, one I hope to obtain but I was told that just cutting won't give me that physique. That I have to bulk and gain muscle first before cutting fat.

I'm so conflicted. Anyone think they can offer me some advice? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> How to avoid getting hurt while holding Kicking Pads/Shields or wearing a Chest Protector? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-10-18 08:39:49 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> When we do kicking drills with the shields/pads or with just wearing a chest protector, I still get knocked the air out of me sometimes when someone lands a good back kick and it still hurts when someone is just pounding on my ribs with those alternating roundhouses while I just stand there with my chest gear on. Is this something you get used to over time?

At the school I originally started out at, the students didn't kick very hard at all. But after trying out a few other Taekwondo and Muay Thai schools, I notice the majority of students training with intensity. Of course we don't intentionally try to kill each other, or at least I don't, but it really sucks when you're just standing there holding a shield/pad or with your arms out to the side, fully vulnerable with chest gear exposed and having to just tank those kicks. Damn, they can hurt. 

I noticed trying to breathe out when getting kicked seems to help when I'm wearing the chest gear and acting as a human dummy or applying a bit of counter-force at the same time my opponent kicks the shield/pad I'm holding.

Any advice on how to minimize the pain? Or am I just being kind of a bitch. </TEXT>

At my old Dojang we were taught to have control and not make contact with Head Kicks, so I have this extremely bad habit of stopping RIGHT BEFORE I make contact. I can't get over it. It shows up during kicking drills and it shows up during sparring. 

Please give me advice.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> At my Taekwondo Dojang, you have the option to test every two months. $69 a week before the testing date and you're pretty much guaranteed to go up a belt. No one ever fails. 

I think it's a little ridiculous how easy it is to go up Belts. I've already paid $300+ and there's still 10 more Belts to go before I reach Black Belt. Sometimes I don't feel like I'm learning anything new besides forms when going up belts though. I don't think I'm getting adequate training and I want to say the same for my fellow students as well.

As an Orange Belt sparring with Brown and Black Belts, my teacher has asked me to go easier on them which I find ridiculous. The level of skill that the majority higher level belts have is very lacking. I shouldn't have to go easier on higher belts just because I train harder than them in my free time.

I was thinking about this earlier and I realized how pointless these Belts are now. I don't think I can afford to keep paying for my Belt testing and that is why I will never achieve my dream of becoming a Black Belt.

Besides, money is scarce right now and college books are more important to me.

**tl;dr: Belts at my Dojang aren't so much a measure of skill as they are a measure of how much disposable income you have.**

	<TEXT> I've been doing Olympic-Style WTF Taekwondo for a year now.

My Taekwondo school has been getting really stale lately. The only people in my adult class are two 12 and 13 y/o boys, three 15-16 y/o girls, a ~40ish y/o man, occasional 30 y/o women, and a 17 y/o me. I can't fucking spar full force against anyone without being afraid I'll break them (literally). We've had to **cancel all our sparring classes** because the low number of students in the Adult class who actually show up on Sparring days. So right now all we do is Forms, Kicking Drills, BS Self-Defense lessons (Oh, if you punch me I'll step to the side and strike your organs! Wait no! You're supposed to not react when I chop you in the ribcage!!! ), and other random things that would get me *mugged* irl. 

I practice by myself these past few months after all the teenage boys/ young men around my age left. I usually don't show up to class as much anymore, and when I do we hardly even do kicking drills anymore. 
I feel like I get a lot more practice just doing kicking drills with the dummy on my own and going to class and comparing myself with the Black Belts confirms it. 

The Black Belts in my class aren't real Black Belts, imo. They don't remember their One-Step forms, Poomsaes, and they're very sub-par when it comes to Sparring. I usually make short-work with them and I'm only a Purple-Striped Belt. It got to the point where, when we did do sparring, that my Master would ask me to go easier on them. I'm 100% sure they would get mugged irl too.

I recently went to an **MMA Gym** and tried out the Muay Thai class there and man was I impressed. People do not waste time there. We spend ~10-15 minutes or so warming up by Jumping Rope (Which is one hell of a leg burn) and alternating between Push-Ups and Sit-Ups. Afterwards we grab a partner and practice various sets of combinations/techniques with the pads and then we get to have a "free round" where we can practice anything we want. We get some time to spar at the end of each class as well. Let me tell, you. It was intense. No one was going easy. In fact, after getting into the habit of always holding back with my strikes, the students there and the teacher there encouraged me to hit harder because I was hitting too softly (compared to everyone else who uses their roundhouse kicks like they're swinging a freaking bat.) At the end of the day I was really sweaty and ridiculously sore all over, a feeling I would never get in Taekwondo class. I learned so much in that one day class trial too and got the chance to come to another day for free. A lot of Taekwondo techniques do transition over to Muay Thai pretty well and the coaches there offered to help me build off of what I already know since they also have had experience in Taekwondo. Oh, they also have a huge gym too. There's a weight room, heavy bag room, octagon/cage, everything. Also everyone in here looks like they're in **very good shape**. It's mostly young men, a couple older guys (that're still in very good shape as well), and a few girls that can probably take on all the Black Belts at my school single-handedly.

A lot of the habits we develop in Taekwondo - like not keeping our hands up is a very *very* **very** bad habit in Muay Thai since in Olympic Taekwondo, they restrict face punches. Now since Boxing is a big aspect in Muay Thai, if you keep your hands low, you're gonna get knocked out.

I also realized how terrible my hands were. I can't recall a single day we practiced punches in Taekwondo, despite the fact that the Master keeps claiming it's 70% Kicking and 30% Punching. Unless, you include the Punching we do as part of our forms as Punching, than yeah I guess. Looking back, Olympic Taekwondo sparring is no way analogous with Practical/Realistic Fighting whereas Muay Thai is **very** practical.

Unfortunately, if I stop doing Taekwondo (my year contract is over by the end of this month btw) before I reach my Black Belt, my father would be very disappointed. My father has encouraged me so much to earn my Black Belt (because apparently it looks good on college applications or something) and it's heavily implied that I would make him very proud if I managed to earn it. But, I don't want to spend his money on learning all the nonsense I've had to put up with this entire year. It's not worth it, imo.

Oh yeah, by the way, you can pretty much go up a belt every two months if you can afford to pay the $70 Belt "testing" fee. There's fucking 15 Belts though and I'm not even halfway there yet. I've gone up 5 Belts in a year though.

Disclaimer: NO disrespect to my Master or the Art of Taekwondo, itself. This is just my own opinion with my particular school and experience. 

tl;dr: I'm not learning anything new in TKD. Went to a Muay Thai class, learned a lot and broke one hell of sweat doing so. Should I switch and make myself happy (and a better martial artist) or should I try to go for my Black Belt and make my father happy? 

EDIT: Hopefully I get at least a few answers. I can already tell I pissed some people off by the *huge amount of downvotes*. Even though I have no idea why. Sorry if I posted this on the wrong subreddit. 


**EDIT#2**: Stunning realization at 3 AM
I've wasted time and money learning fucking nonsense that the school has taught me.

Who the fuck fights with their guard down?


I DO.


Who the fuck has to spend half the class doing ridiculous Yoga stretches?


I DO.


Who paid $70 five times for my own master to evaluate me to go up a belt that means fucking nothing since I've had to go easier on Brown Belts when I was an Orange Belt?


MY FATHER DID.


AND WHO HAS BEEN PRACTICING "Self-Defense" TECHNIQUES AS IF THE PERSON I'M USING ON WON'T REACT TO IT AT ALL AND ALLOW ME TO PERFORM 5 CONSECUTIVE STRIKES WHILE THEY STAND COMPLETELY STILL!?


-I FUCKING DO.


Who the fuck spars with little boys and young girls and expects to improve?


I fucking do


Who the fuck has been practicing a style that involves no face punches?


I do.


Disclaimer: Granted all the things above, I was forced to do by my Master since he was teaching the goddamn class. I used to look up to him like a fucking God. Now I realize what a joke everything is.



WTF Taekwondo is a bunch of bullshit and if I hadn't been practicing on my own, I would've had absolutely nothing to carry over to Muay Thai. At least I've gotten good at the Spinning Back Kick and the Spinning Heel Kick (which seem to have made it's way over to MMA very well) and obtained a good level of flexibility.


**tl;dr: I've realized I've gotten really good at something that's dumb.**



EDIT#3: Public Service Anouncement - If you do Taekwondo, realize that you're doing it for sport and that it is NO WAY analogous or similar to Real Fighting at all. You can and likely will get knocked out irl if you try to fight with your hands down and do tippy tap snappy kicks that have no power behind them.

Trust me, I've been training pretty hard at this. And it fucking sucks.


EDIT#4: Too many fucking edits. This post turned out to be way longer than I intended it to be. Sorry. 


EDIT#5: 

Who the fuck spends time breaking wooden boards to "showcase their power?"

	<TEXT> I've been doing Olympic-Style WTF Taekwondo for a year now.

My Taekwondo school has been getting really stale lately. The only people in my adult class are two 12 and 13 y/o boys, three 15-16 y/o girls, a ~40ish y/o man, occasional 30 y/o women, and a 17 y/o me. I can't fucking spar full force against anyone without being afraid I'll break them (literally). We've had to cancelled all our sparring classes because the low number of students in the Adult class who actually show up on Sparring days. So right now all we do is Forms, Kicking Drills, BS Self-Defense lessons (Oh, if you punch me I'll step to the side and strike your organs! Wait no! You're supposed to not react when I chop you in the ribcage!!! ), and other random things that would get me *mugged or beat up* irl. 

I practice by myself these past few months after all the teenage boys/ young men around my age left. I usually don't show up to class as much anymore, and when I do we hardly even do kicking drills anymore. 
I feel like I get a lot more practice just doing kicking drills with the dummy on my own and going to class and comparing myself with the Black Belts confirms it. 

The Black Belts in my class aren't real Black Belts, imo. They don't remember their One-Step forms, Poomsaes, and they're very sub-par when it comes to Sparring. I usually make short-work with them and I'm only a Purple-Striped Belt. It got to the point where, when we did do sparring, that my Master would ask me to go easier on them.

I recently went to an MMA Gym and tried out the Muay Thai class there and man was I impressed. People do not waste time there. We spend ~10 minutes or so warming up by Jumping Rope (Which is one hell of a leg burn) and alternating between Push-Ups and Sit-Ups. Afterwards we grab a partner and practice various sets of combinations/techniques with the pads and then we get to have a "free round" where we can practice anything we want. We get some time to spar at the end of each class as well. Let me tell, you. It was intense. No one was going easy. In fact, after getting into the habit of always holding back with my strikes, the students there and the teacher there encouraged me to hit harder because I was hitting too softly (compared to everyone else who uses their roundhouse kicks like they're swinging a freaking bat.) At the end of the day I was really sweaty and ridiculously sore all over, a feeling I would never get in Taekwondo class. I learned so much in that one day class trial too and got the chance to come to another day for free. A lot of Taekwondo techniques do transition over to Muay Thai pretty well and the coaches there offered to help me build off of what I already know since they also have had experience in Taekwondo.

A lot of the habits we develop in Taekwondo - like not keeping our hands up is a very *very* **very** bad habit in Muay Thai since in Olympic Taekwondo, they restrict face punches. Now since Boxing is a big aspect in Muay Thai, if you keep your hands low, you're gonna get knocked out.

I also realized how terrible my hands were. I can't recall a single day we practiced punches in Taekwondo, despite the fact that the Master keeps claiming it's 70% Kicking and 30% Punching. Unless, you include the Punching we do as part of our forms as Punching, than yeah I guess. Looking back, Olympic Taekwondo sparring is no way analogous with Practical/Realistic Fighting whereas Muay Thai is **very** practical.

Unfortunately, if I stop doing Taekwondo (my year contract is over by the end of this month btw) before I reach my Black Belt, my father would be very disappointed. My father has encouraged me so much to earn my Black Belt (because apparently it looks good on college applications or something) and it's heavily implied that I would make him very proud if I managed to earn it. But, I don't want to spend his money on learning all the nonsense I've had to put up with this entire year. It's not worth it, imo.

Watching UFC, I noticed a lot of fighters throwing leg kicks at each other in a fight, but I never notice the effect/impact that it has on the person taking the hit. I believe the purpose of the leg kick is to, obviously, injure the other person's base and slow them down but most fighters seem to be able to tank the hits just fine. 


It seems to me like leg kicks are usually just checks. Is that true? Can someone explain this to me? I'd really like to know. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I started taking Taekwondo in October of last year. I thought I would be learning an intense martial art and get a great workout out of it. I want to get into MMA, eventually because I really like the versatility of it. I thought Taekwondo would give me a great striking base and an advantage over other striking styles because of the unorthodox kicks like the Wheel Kick/Spinning Hook Kick and the Back Kick. Anthony Pettis, Anderson Silva, Cung Le, Edson Barboza, and various other MMA fighters with TKD backgrounds have inspired me to take up this great kicking art.


I was fucking wrong.


90% of the people in my class are either teenage girls or moms. The other 9% are young boys who somehow made the adult class and out of shape middle-aged men. I'm 17.


I find myself having to go easy on everyone. Even though I'm only a Purple-Stripe belt (6 belts from White Belt), I spar better than everyone in my class including the Black Belts, which are all teenage girls btw, other than the Master and his son.


Apparently, no one in my class likes Sparring other than me. We used to spar twice a week, (Tuesdays and Fridays) but then it got cut down to one because no one showed up to Sparring on Fridays.


Tuesday Sparring is bullshit. We don't even spar the entire time, we practice on one-steps/basic kicking drills first and then, IF I'M LUCKY, we get to do free sparring for 10 minutes or so. Most of the time, there's more girls than guys in the class. When that happens, the Master sits all the guys down and has us watch the girls. So, basically, if there's not enough guys in the class, I don't get to spar.


I've always wanted to get a Black Belt in Martial Arts because I thought it showed commitment. But, belt testing is $69 per testing and I don't feel like I'm truly learning anything new each time I move up a belt.
Pretty much, the only reason why I'm at the level I'm at is because I watch a lot of tutorials by Kwonkicker   GingerNinjaTrickster on YouTube along with TKD Competition videos which teaches me techniques I haven't learned in class and good combos to go along with them.


Most of the time, in sparring, the other people in my class just stick with basic roundhouse kicks and predictable/ill-timed back kicks. On the other hand, I use my entire arsenal. Roundhouse Kick feint into Spinning Hook Kick, Side Kick transition to jump Back Kick, etc. etc.


I wish there were more people around my age that could spar with me. My Master's son is a very good fighter and has proven it time and time again in National competitions. His footwork, timing, speed, feints, and dexterity with his kicks is insane. I want to get that good, but I know I'll never get that good with the kind of competition I'm sparring with, when I get to spar that is


I feel like I've been wasting my time and money here. Though, I really want to just detach myself from this dojang and go learn some real fighting, I'd feel like it'd be a waste for me to drop my training when I haven't even gotten my First Degree Black Belt. On the flipside, I feel it's a meaningless title if I keep training with the people here.


tl;dr: Competition at this school is stale. Is it worth to keep going to get my Black Belt before training in Muay Thai, or should I just drop now? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What sets it apart from Karate, Taekwondo, Sanshou, Kickboxing, etc. etc.


Is it just more well-balanced and better suited for the MMA ruleset than the other striking styles?

Karate, Kickboxing, TKD, etc. etc. have limitations in their sparring rules. But, Muay Thai sparring seems to be the most "free" of all of them which is good for transitioning into MMA. Is that what it is?

Oh, and is it possible to be a good Striker without adding Muay Thai to your skillset? Having come from doing a lot of traditional Martial Arts as a child, it seems to me that all the striking arts have the same basics. When you get into the more advance techniques, what works and doesn't work for MMA should depend on what you believe is right for the current situation. For EX, Spinning Hook Kicks are encouraged in TKD sparring as it yields the most points. (Also, it's done very often because there's no punches to the head allowed) However, in MMA or Muay Thai, wheel kicks can also be dangerous because you're turning your back. So basically, what's encouraged and good for certain TMAs sparring rules, can be risky for MMA.


For MMA, you need to be able to adapt to the Striking rules there. There's no "no head punches" rule, no points, or etc. etc. so you gotta be able to adapt. It's more of a mindset than anything and Muay Thai seems to be better suited for that from the get-go. Is that right?

	<TEXT> Started my freshman year of college last month. Never had a girlfriend throughout High School. Got rejected three times in a row with three different girls and that just hurt my confidence and self-esteem for awhile. But that's in the past.


Cute girl in my English class. Been wanting to talk to her for awhile just too shy to. She walks my direction on Monday after I'm walking to the parking lot because class was cancelled, I let her know and she thanked me.


Today, I was waiting in my car for class to start and she happened to park right next to me. Tried to say Hi but she didn't notice. Left my car and went to class about 3 minutes before she left her car.


Both of us were waiting infront of class for the teacher to come. I start talking to her. I make up jokes about how I hope class'll be cancelled again. Also, jokingly tells her I noticed she parked right next to me and I tried to say Hi but she totally ignored me. She laughs and such. Asked her about her Major, what she wants to do etc. etc.
In class, sits next to her, introduces myself and she introduces herself. Goes in for a handshake in which she jokingly replies that I should have a firmer handshake.


Jokingly asks her if I could copy off her for the quiz with a wink. She says yes and laughs. Some basic flirting here and there etc. etc. etc.


Turns out with both have the same major but she switched to Poli-Sci and we have the same classes with the same teachers (just at different times besides this English Class) If anything, that's at least one thing that we both have in common that I can talk about :)

Was planning on getting her number at the end of class but totally chickened out. (I had my phone stolen yesterday but just got a spare phone from a friend) Instead I told her I'd see her next week while walking out of class and she just smiled and waved at me.


Next class is on Monday :/ Really wanted to keep talking to her. She's outrageously pretty, smart, and funny :)


I think I made a pretty good first impression, she was pretty engaged when I was talking and making jokes. :)
I was trying to be myself and was acting confident doing so.


Anyways, advice on getting her number on Monday and maybe getting closer with her? I have terrible experiences with girls and I'm determined to change it my luck this time around :D


Thank you, Reddit. First time on this sub.


P.S. Sorry for grammar.


Edit: Also she looks extremely out of my league. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> In my Taekwondo Dojang, we learn applications of self-defense from Hapkido as well as part of our standard Taekwondo curriculum. Most of our self-defense techniques involve learning how to release yourself from a wrist-grab and following up with a joint lock whether it be an armbar or a wristlock. 
So far, I have learned 10 different ways (2 techniques learned per belt) of releasing yourself from a wrist-grab and I've found it unnecessarily excessive that we have to practice so many different techniques to release ourselves from a wrist-grab. In most hostile situations, I doubt knowing how to release yourself from a wrist-grab would come in handy. I wish we would learn more practical self-defense like how to block punches or something instead of learning a million ways of defending yourself from a wrist-grab. 
Can someone explain to me why wrist-grab self-defense is so emphasized? I'm pretty sure there's a good reason, I just can't come up with one on my own and, to be frank, I doubt I will ever need to apply this technique in a real life scenario.




The problem when learning these "One-Step" Self-Defense techniques is we practice doing them as if the opponent wouldn't react. I doubt in a real life situation if someone ever grabbed your wrist, they wouldn't just stand their and allow you to release yourself. The moment you'd try to react to the wrist-grab, they'd probably punch you in the face. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Why don't we see Punches in WTF Taekwondo </TITLE>

	<TEXT> I've seen so many ridiculous explanations to why Taekwondo practitioners keep their hands down to the side and do not punch. Some even argue that Taekwondo practitioners do not punch because "punches do not score as much as a kick" which is ridiculous because anyone who does WTF Taekwondo Sparring knows that a Punch or Kick to the body is worth one point. 

I've watched several videos of big WTF Taekwondo competitions ranging from World Tournaments to the Olympics and the style of fighting is very much the same. Many practitioners keep their hands to the side and do not throw punches even when in punching-distance (they go in for the clinch). 
While there's probably a valid strategical reason for this, it just doesn't make sense to me why 99% of people do not throw punches in this sport even though it is perfectly legal and, according to the rules, scores a point.
People will argue that kicking is the shortest distance between you and your opponent, but isn't the shortest distance really a straight punch from the leading hand? Punching is quicker than Kicking if you are in proper range.

Because of the way I've seen other practitioners spar, it has affected the way I spar. I feel extremely awkward whenever I am in punching-range with someone and try to exchange punches with them because we never practice throwing punches, at all. (Except maybe for Counter Punches here and there where you block with one hand and go in for a punch with the other hand) I'd get into range with someone, exchange some punches then taking some punches (because I was never taught how to Block Punches) then slide back to kicking distance. I feel almost like punching is discouraged.

A friend once asked me if you could win a Taekwondo fight with purely punches and I did not know how to answer his question. Theoretically, according to the rules, you should be able to. But, that fact of the matter is, I have never seen someone throw a punch (if they even throw a punch) in WTF Sparring and scored a point from it. I believe that since the the rules make it so difficult to score a point with punches, it is actually discouraging punching in a way.

tl;dr: Why do WTF Taekwondo Practitioners spar with their hands by their sides (Guard Down) and do not throw Punches? This seems like a very impractical way to fight and, in my own personal opinion, creates bad habits for when a Taekwondo practitioner fights under a different rule set or in a hostile street fight situation. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I consider myself a huge follower of Bruce Lee's philosophy. 
(The Following is a sample of Bruce's Philosophy in my own words and interpretation) Bruce believed that a martial artist shouldn't be limited to any one style of fighting. According to him, a martial artist should be able to adapt to any situations. To him, "styles" are attempts to "arrest the flow of conflict" and in actual combat, the opponent doesn't wait for formalities. The opponent isn't a robot, but a human being-fluid and alive. To him, "traditional arts were a blind devotion to the systematic uselessness of routines that lead nowhere." That's why he went against tradition and created his own martial art/philosophy of "Jeet Kune Do" a style without styles so that it may assume every style. (Sorry if that's a bit confusing).
My father is a traditional man and is against my intentions of studying other martial arts outside of Taekwondo. In my opinion, a good martial artist should be proficient in multiple fields rather than just one. For example, Taekwondo is a good striking art that uses kicks as the weapon of choice and is well known for their variety of deadly kicks. However, everything has their strengths and weaknesses. Taekwondo fighters are generally not very good at using their hands offensively and since kicks can only be thrown at a long distance, they would be at a huge disadvantage at close-range fighting against a trained Boxer. Also, when it comes to ground fighting and grappling, Taekwondo fighters aren't usually taught how to handle those types of situations. So, if I were ever taken to the ground by a Jujitsu practitioner, I would have no idea how to handle myself properly in that situation. With all that said, my point is that every martial art has their strengths and weaknesses. If you only know one martial art, you're stuck with that one style's weakness. However, mastering other arts may compensate for each others' weaknesses. This is what I believe and what I find logical. However, my father believes that mastering one art is enough to handle any kind of situation. I strongly disagree. I just came here today to ask for everyone's opinions on me   my father's beliefs. I want to hear the Pros and Cons of Cross-Training in Martial Arts. 
Thank you for your time. </TEXT>
