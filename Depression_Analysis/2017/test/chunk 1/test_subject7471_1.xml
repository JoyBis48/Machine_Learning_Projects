	<TEXT> Just because I have chosen to provide some care for an animal doesn't mean I can cause any amount of harm to other animals to benefit the animal I have chosen to care for. An animal that is distant, who I won't see suffering, or who has less connection to me or someone I know is no less deserving of ethical consideration than the one that is right in front of me. An ethical person would weigh their interests similarly. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks for citing the appropriate wikipedia article. I am doing all of this from my cell phone, so it is a bit tough to look things up. I have read the study you cited previously. I think you have failed to emphasize that none of the vegan cats were deficient in taurine, as well as to provide a reference for the proportion of cats on conventional food with low taurine levels. That said, the study does show that vegan cat owners could better protect their cats' health by choosing a vegan cat food with higher taurine.

I'm also not arguing that the cats will be the ones better off if they eat a vegan diet. Even if all 96 million cats died from a vegan diet, how many fewer animals would be slaughtered to become cat food if all cats were fed a vegan diet? You cannot choose the most ethical option for feeding your cat without considering all of the consequences of your choice. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am saying it is better to choose the option that causes less harm to animals than the option that causes more harm. This is probably one of the  least controversial ethical statements anyone could make. 

It sounds like you are trying to describe a situation where more harm would be caused by letting the dog suffer and die than is caused to a snake to produce a single dose of antivenom. If that is the case I would say the less harmful option is the better one. If it were not the case I would still say the less harmful option is better. 

I am not saying that every scenario is clear cut or that I always know which option is less harmful. However, I have yet to see anyone even attempt to make the case that the animals being raised and slaughtered for cat food are harmed less than a cat would be even if it was fed the worst possible diet. </TEXT>

Why aren't you more concerned for the lives of the animals that are killed to become non-vegan cat food? Far more than 9 animals would die to feed 9 cats a non-vegan diet for their entire lives. Shouldn't killing more animals be seen as worse than something that kills fewer animals (if any)? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The Life You Can Save, and the other effective altruism work of yours that I have seen, seem to focus predominately on mitigating terrible cases of human suffering, which is undoubtedly an important cause. However, it seems quite likely that each of us can do much more with the same amount of resources to mitigate animal suffering. A good deal of your other work has addressed the issue of speciesism and the importance of animal rights in living an ethical life, but the work on effective altruism within the animal rights movement (for example the work done by [Animal Charity Evaluators](http://www.animalcharityevaluators.org/recommendations/top-charities/)) seems to be more of an afterthought. Why have you chosen to focus much more specifically on humans in your recent work? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The way you worded it doesn't really describe his position, but let me Google the answer for you:

Q. You have been quoted as saying: "Killing a defective infant is not morally equivalent to killing a person. Sometimes it is not wrong at all." Is that quote accurate? 

A. It is accurate, but can be misleading if read without an understanding of what I mean by the term person (which is discussed in Practical Ethics, from which that quotation is taken). I use the term "person" to refer to a being who is capable of anticipating the future, of having wants and desires for the future.  As I have said in answer to the previous question, I think that it is generally a greater wrong to kill such a being than it is to kill a being that has no sense of existing over time. Newborn human babies have no sense of their own existence over time. So killing a newborn baby is never equivalent to killing a person, that is, a being who wants to go on living.  That doesnt mean that it is not almost always a terrible thing to do.  It is, but that is because most infants are loved and cherished by their parents, and to kill an infant is usually to do a great wrong to its parents. 
Sometimes, perhaps because the baby has a serious disability, parents think it better that their newborn infant should die. Many doctors will accept their wishes, to the extent of not giving the baby life-supporting medical treatment.  That will often ensure that the baby dies.  My view is different from this, only to the extent that if a decision is taken, by the parents and doctors, that it is better that a baby should die, I believe it should be possible to carry out that decision, not only by withholding or withdrawing life-support  which can lead to the baby dying slowly from dehydration or from an infection - but also by taking active steps to end the babys life swiftly and humanely.

	<TEXT> Someone else posted about blood type diets being BS. Here is the consensus about appropriately planned vegetarian and vegan diets being healthy for all stages of life:

**[American Dietetic Association](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19562864)**

 It is the position of the American Dietetic Association that appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases. Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence, and for athletes.

**[Dietitians of Canada](http://www.dietitians.ca/Nutrition-Resources-A-Z/Factsheets/Vegetarian/Eating-Guidelines-for-Vegans.aspx)**

 A well planned vegan diet can meet all of these needs. It is safe and healthy for pregnant and breastfeeding women, babies, children, teens and seniors.

**[The British National Health Service](http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/Vegetarianhealth/Pages/Vegandiets.aspx)**

 With good planning and an understanding of what makes up a healthy, balanced vegan diet, you can get all the nutrients your body needs.

**[The British Nutrition Foundation](http://www.nutrition.org.uk/publications/briefingpapers/vegetarian-nutrition)**

 A well-planned, balanced vegetarian or vegan diet can be nutritionally adequate ... Studies of UK vegetarian and vegan children have revealed that their growth and development are within the normal range.

**[The Dietitians Association of Australia](http://daa.asn.au/for-the-public/smart-eating-for-you/nutrition-a-z/vegan-diets/)**

 Vegan diets are a type of vegetarian diet, where only plant-based foods are eaten. They differ to other vegetarian diets in that no animal products are usually consumed or used. Despite these restrictions, with good planning it is still possible to obtain all the nutrients required for good health on a vegan diet.

**[The United States Department of Agriculture](http://www.choosemyplate.gov/healthy-eating-tips/tips-for-vegetarian.html)**

 Vegetarian diets (*see context*) can meet all the recommendations for nutrients. The key is to consume a variety of foods and the right amount of foods to meet your calorie needs. Follow the food group recommendations for your age, sex, and activity level to get the right amount of food and the variety of foods needed for nutrient adequacy. Nutrients that vegetarians may need to focus on include protein, iron, calcium, zinc, and vitamin B12.

**[The National Health and Medical Research Council](http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/_files_nhmrc/publications/attachments/n55a_australian_dietary_guidelines_summary_130530.pdf)**

 Alternatives to animal foods include nuts, seeds, legumes, beans and tofu. For all Australians,
these foods increase dietary variety and can provide a valuable, affordable source of protein
and other nutrients found in meats. These foods are also particularly important for those who
follow vegetarian or vegan dietary patterns. Australians following a vegetarian diet can still meet nutrient requirements if energy needs are met and the appropriate number and variety of serves from the Five Food Groups are eaten throughout the day. For those eating a vegan diet, supplementation of B12 is recommended.

**[The Mayo Clinic](http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-living/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/vegetarian-diet/art-20046446)**

  A well-planned vegetarian diet (*see context*) can meet the needs of people of all ages, including children, teenagers, and pregnant or breast-feeding women. The key is to be aware of your nutritional needs so that you plan a diet that meets them.

**[The Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada](http://www.heartandstroke.com/site/c.ikIQLcMWJtE/b.3484249/k.2F6C/Healthy_living__Vegetarian_diets.htm)**

	<TEXT> Of course the legislature should only pass laws if there is a good reason for them. That isn't what this amendment is going to ensure. It will instead provide a basis for large agricultural interests to legally challenge laws they don't like in court. You wouldn't only need to convince a majority of legislators and the governor to pass a law, you also need to prove it to a judge, and if he or she sides with you then another judge on appeal. At the same time laws that favor big ag without good public reason will go unchallenged, and those that only hurt smaller farms that cannot afford the legal costs will go unchallenged too. This is an amendment designed to enshrine big business interests in the state's constitution. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Being natural is completely irrelevant. If humans had been having sex with animals for hundreds of thousands of years and it was more convenient for you to find an animal to have sex with than another human would it be okay then?

Meat isn't easy either. It takes time to cook, it comes with high risk of foodborne illness, most of the world considers it to be a luxury. [Soylent](http://www.soylent.me/) is a vegan option that is incredibly convenient (just add water). You can get nuts at any store, they keep well for long periods of time, and you can eat them right out of the container by the handful. Rice and beans are staples of the world's poor. There is no reason to eat meat other than the fact that you enjoy it despite the terrible harm caused to animals, which is the exact reasoning behind why people engage in the cruelty of having non-consensual sex with animals. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> PETA is certainly a group with significant shortcomings, but lets not forget that this campaign against PETA is driven by an industry lobbyist group, the [Center for Consumer Freedom](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_for_Consumer_Freedom), with the goal of conflating PETA with animal rights and setting the entire cause back.

Whenever you see these stories, please consider making a donation to a group doing actual work to help animals. [Here are charities that Animal Charity Evaluators has recommended as the most effective for helping animals](http://www.animalcharityevaluators.org/recommendations/). PETA does not deserve your money, but animals should not be left to suffer because industry funded interests want to shut their opponents up entirely. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Nothing - absolutely nothing - in that paragraph describes you as a vegan. Nor do you admit that you do in fact have issues with the consumption of all animal products, which to me would be a much more intellectually honest conversation.

When someone mentions that they're vegan reddit's response is, "how do you know someone is vegan? Don't worry they'll tell you." When someone doesn't mention that they're vegan you then try to call them out for not mentioning it.

It seems to me like some people just want to find a reason to get upset with vegans for simply existing. </TEXT>

Roughly 60 billion is the number of birds and mammals killed worldwide for food every year.

Depending upon which marine animals you count, 110 billion could be a total for the number of individuals killed annually for food, but you can also find much higher numbers that count a broader range of marine animals. </TEXT>

Do humans experience 10,000 times as much joy as non-human animals? Do we suffer 10,000 times as intensely? Are our interests 10,000 times stronger? It is admittedly hard to estimate such things, but I don't think any reasonable estimate would be anywhere near 10,000 times.

	<TEXT> Unfortunately, chickens are not just egg laying machines, and many municipalities have begun having problems with people who buy chickens thinking they are getting a lifetime supply of eggs, but a couple years down the road when the chickens start laying far fewer eggs, these people won't slaughter the chickens, so they just end up getting abandoned. No commercial farm is keeping spent hens for life either, but they inevitably end up getting sent to slaughter. At the same time, if you are buying chickens from a hatchery you are inevitably supporting the killing of many male chicks who are of no use for egg laying purposes. 

If keeping chickens is something you are able to do, look into adopting spent hens as there is a serious need for people to rescue these animals. They are loving companions who deserve and will appreciate your affection, but don't expect to be getting a large number of free eggs out of it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hostage taking? We don't want a feral child incident. (This is a reference to the movie [Bold Native](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JToC6l9Xx_c). For those who haven't seen it the film depicts an ALF cell that plans a nationwide string of actions to free animals. At one point in the film the protagonist meets up with an old friend who he had lost touch with, and finds out she had been keeping a factory farmer in her basement, treating him like he treated his animals, and calling him the "Feral Child" while posting videos of it online.)

While I highly recommend the movie Bold Native, I don't think direct action is an effective strategy for achieving the goals we want. In the film the protagonist, Charlie, says, "people will ask themselves 'why are people willing to risk so much to save animals?'" when describing the outcome he hoped to see from his actions. What we really see when these actions take place is people acting like we are the terrorists and simply giving the justification that animal rights activists are crazy as the reason why we fight so hard for the cause.

We need to make the case to people that animal rights matter so that they choose to respect animal rights on their own. Making threats or taking actions against people is not the way to accomplish this. Outreach like what /u/VeganMinecraft is doing, or what groups like Mercy for Animals, Vegan Outreach, and the Humane League regularly participate in is the most effective way to achieve this. </TEXT>

Obviously one consumer or just the United States isn't going to eliminate all global demand for animal products, but if all Americans gave up meat it would make a world of difference for roughly 10 billion mammals and birds per year that Americans would have otherwise consumed. </TEXT>

However, as demand declines, fewer animals will be bred and raised in captivity to meet the lower demand. The animals who are not being born into these atrocious factory farm conditions down the road are the ones being saved by your choice to abstain from meat. </TEXT>

However, there is also the aspect of whether they are animals that can meaningfully be exploited or harmed, as there are some animals such as sponges, that lack nervous systems and therefore there is little reason to suspect they can suffer. Insects do possess nervous systems, and most vegans feel there is sufficient reason to suspect insects can suffer to warrant not consuming them. </TEXT>

 With good planning and an understanding of what makes up a healthy, balanced vegan diet, you can get all the nutrients your body needs.

 A well-planned, balanced vegetarian or vegan diet can be nutritionally adequate ... Studies of UK vegetarian and vegan children have revealed that their growth and development are within the normal range.

**[The Dietitians Association of Australia](http://daa.asn.au/for-the-public/smart-eating-for-you/nutrition-a-z/vegan-diets/)**

 Vegan diets are a type of vegetarian diet, where only plant-based foods are eaten. They differ to other vegetarian diets in that no animal products are usually consumed or used. Despite these restrictions, with good planning it is still possible to obtain all the nutrients required for good health on a vegan diet.

**[The United States Department of Agriculture](http://www.choosemyplate.gov/healthy-eating-tips/tips-for-vegetarian.html)**

 Vegetarian diets (*see context*) can meet all the recommendations for nutrients. The key is to consume a variety of foods and the right amount of foods to meet your calorie needs. Follow the food group recommendations for your age, sex, and activity level to get the right amount of food and the variety of foods needed for nutrient adequacy. Nutrients that vegetarians may need to focus on include protein, iron, calcium, zinc, and vitamin B12.

**[The National Health and Medical Research Council](http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/_files_nhmrc/publications/attachments/n55a_australian_dietary_guidelines_summary_130530.pdf)**

 Alternatives to animal foods include nuts, seeds, legumes, beans and tofu. For all Australians,
these foods increase dietary variety and can provide a valuable, affordable source of protein
and other nutrients found in meats. These foods are also particularly important for those who
follow vegetarian or vegan dietary patterns. Australians following a vegetarian diet can still meet nutrient requirements if energy needs are met and the appropriate number and variety of serves from the Five Food Groups are eaten throughout the day. For those eating a vegan diet, supplementation of B12 is recommended.

**[The Mayo Clinic](http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-living/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/vegetarian-diet/art-20046446)**

The worst event I have ever been to for pseudoscience nonsense was actually a green festival (I ran the Action For Animals table at the San Francisco and Los Angeles Green Festivals a couple years back). There were magnetic bracelets and "energy" jewelry galore. It was a really disappointing glimpse at the environmental movement that made you realize why some people would question the accuracy of the environmental claims these people were making.

They also printed our name badges on paper made from elephant poop. I feel like they should at least give a heads up before someone hangs some elephant feces around their neck. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Don't patronize us as if we don't have any idea of what happens in the dairy industry. I have been to idyllic dairy farms. I have helped in the process of making cheese with milk from cows that I milked myself. I follow the posts of the [National Dairy Council](http://www.nationaldairycouncil.org/Pages/Home.aspx) and read articles from just about every dairy industry magazine that publishes their material online. Not only do we follow the dairy industry's own publications, but there are vegans who [are former large scale dairy farmers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Lyman).  

I don't just watch undercover investigations posted by animal rights groups. I watch [videos from dairy farmers of their own operations, like this video of farmers "reuniting" their cows with their calves](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vSIlTNED-Q). I no longer just see a few happy cows though. I see several panicked mothers who are seeing their children again as well as many more who are still frantically searching for their lost sons. Mothers who may never fully recover from the trauma of losing their children. I read [this comment](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2zwd7f/what_goes_on_in_the_mind_of_a_cow/cpn3ixe) recently from someone else who, like yourself, grew up on a dairy farm, and described the efforts the mothers go through to protect their children. I see the hopeless sons crying for their mothers, but who will most likely face a short life before being slaughtered for veal. I see the slaughter the cows themselves will inevitably face as they age.

We don't make the decision to change our lifestyles lightly, but only after thoroughly researching and understanding both sides of the issue. When you have put half the effort into understanding our position that we have put into understanding yours, then we will be happy to welcome you for an AMA. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Very few people are vegan because they object to the taste/texture of meat. On the contrary most of us enjoyed meat, but found that we couldn't justify consuming it because of the harm caused to animals, the environment, or personal health. Having things that taste like meat without these negative consequences are a win-win! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Your post got downvoted by many other people than just vegans, but I wouldn't blame vegans for downvoting it too, as most people don't like baseless accusations directed at them. Try going to a thread discussing the keystone XL pipeline and accusing /r/environment of vote brigading without good evidence to back it up. You will get downvoted by members of /r/environment and nonmembers whose opinions you just dismissed as nothing more than part of a vote brigade!

	<TEXT> I have been watching this thread closely too. There isn't some huge vegan force taking vegans to the top and downvoting meat based comments. There are plenty of comments with views on both sides that have been upvoted and downvoted, and while I'm sure there are plenty of redditors with some bias, for the most part the comments that have succeeded have been due to their merits and speaking to a wide audience. The views I have seen expressed in this thread seem to fall within the normal spectrum of views expressed on animal rights across reddit.

I know that /r/vegan made that stickied post in large part because there are inevitably a handful people like yourself who accuse vegans and specifically /r/vegan of vote brigading whenever comments supporting animal rights get upvoted. If you read the top comment from that /r/vegan post it is about how vegans need to hold themselves to a higher standard than the rest of the community in order to be accepted. /r/vegan wanted to make abundantly clear that it did not support any such actions and protect itself from potential backlash from the community or site admins. I know a lot of the members from /r/vegan and none of them support vote brigading, nor have I seen any pattern of problem vote brigading from /r/vegan in the past (any more than any other subreddit). </TEXT>

My submission is approaching 4500 karma because it is a submission that everyone appreciates (well, 96% of people according to the current votes).

You have plenty of things in common with pigs. You share 4 billion years of ancestors, you have a similar brain structure, digestive structure, circulatory system, etc. That said, why does an individual need to be similar to you in order to be deserving of ethical consideration? If there were aliens who were fully aware, possessed strong emotions and interests, and suffered when mistreated, would it be okay to mistreat them simply because they were not similar to you? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If plants did have feelings, far fewer plants would need to be killed if we ate them directly than if we fed plants to animals then subsequently ate those animals, so choosing a plant-based diet would still be a more ethical option. Although, I would argue that choosing a diet particularly heavy in fruit would then be the most ethical choice as plants have evolved to make fruits with the goal of having them be eaten to help spread their seeds. 

However, there is also good reason for us to believe that plants do not feel emotions in any meaningful sense. We know that in ourselves and other animals our experience of emotions exists in the reactions taking place in our nervous system. As plants do not possess nervous systems (and even some animals such as sponges) there is no reason to suspect such capabilities would extend to organisms lacking those systems. 

I have of course read plenty of sensational news stories about how "science proves that plants feel pain." However, all of these stories seem to be based off of much more reasonable research on how plants react to stimuli. A rock will similarly react to the stimuli of being kicked, and a light bulb will react to the stimuli of an electric current, but that does not mean they feel emotions.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As much as people hate to be confronted with criticism of their actions, there are some relevant comparisons to be made. Before people flip the fuck out about "how dare you compare killing animals to the Holocaust or slavery" [read this comic](http://imgur.com/a/BqPzT). I am not saying that they are the same in every regard, nor that they are equally unjust or even that you necessarily have to accept that the comparison tells us anything useful about how we ought to feel about them. I'm saying that in respect to the massive number of deaths or the treatment of individuals as property there is a relevant similarity that can under some circumstances be helpful for understanding both sets of issues. 

While non-human animals may not be deserving of all the ethical consideration of the typical adult human, many of the animals we eat, particularly pigs, are quite intelligent (in many regards more intelligent than young human children). There are many humans (for example the severely mentally handicapped) who will never progress past the intellectual capabilities of a young child, and there is no reason to suspect that they have any more capacity to experience joy or suffering any more intensely than a pig. Nonetheless, we all recognize that it would be a grave injustice to treat these people as we presently treat pigs or other farmed animals. Why should we be any less upset about the terrible treatment of pigs than we would rightly be about similar treatment of severely mentally handicapped individuals? </TEXT>

**[American Dietetic Association](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19562864)**

 It is the position of the American Dietetic Association that appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases. Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence, and for athletes.

**[Dietitians of Canada](http://www.dietitians.ca/Nutrition-Resources-A-Z/Factsheets/Vegetarian/Eating-Guidelines-for-Vegans.aspx)**

 A well planned vegan diet can meet all of these needs. It is safe and healthy for pregnant and breastfeeding women, babies, children, teens and seniors.

**[The British National Health Service](http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/Vegetarianhealth/Pages/Vegandiets.aspx)**

 With good planning and an understanding of what makes up a healthy, balanced vegan diet, you can get all the nutrients your body needs.

**[The British Nutrition Foundation](http://www.nutrition.org.uk/publications/briefingpapers/vegetarian-nutrition)**

 A well-planned, balanced vegetarian or vegan diet can be nutritionally adequate ... Studies of UK vegetarian and vegan children have revealed that their growth and development are within the normal range.

**[The Dietitians Association of Australia](http://daa.asn.au/for-the-public/smart-eating-for-you/nutrition-a-z/vegan-diets/)**

 Vegan diets are a type of vegetarian diet, where only plant-based foods are eaten. They differ to other vegetarian diets in that no animal products are usually consumed or used. Despite these restrictions, with good planning it is still possible to obtain all the nutrients required for good health on a vegan diet.

**[The United States Department of Agriculture](http://www.choosemyplate.gov/healthy-eating-tips/tips-for-vegetarian.html)**

 Vegetarian diets (*see context*) can meet all the recommendations for nutrients. The key is to consume a variety of foods and the right amount of foods to meet your calorie needs. Follow the food group recommendations for your age, sex, and activity level to get the right amount of food and the variety of foods needed for nutrient adequacy. Nutrients that vegetarians may need to focus on include protein, iron, calcium, zinc, and vitamin B12.

**[The National Health and Medical Research Council](http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/_files_nhmrc/publications/attachments/n55a_australian_dietary_guidelines_summary_130530.pdf)**

 Alternatives to animal foods include nuts, seeds, legumes, beans and tofu. For all Australians,
these foods increase dietary variety and can provide a valuable, affordable source of protein
and other nutrients found in meats. These foods are also particularly important for those who
follow vegetarian or vegan dietary patterns. Australians following a vegetarian diet can still meet nutrient requirements if energy needs are met and the appropriate number and variety of serves from the Five Food Groups are eaten throughout the day. For those eating a vegan diet, supplementation of B12 is recommended.

**[The Mayo Clinic](http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-living/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/vegetarian-diet/art-20046446)**

  A well-planned vegetarian diet (*see context*) can meet the needs of people of all ages, including children, teenagers, and pregnant or breast-feeding women. The key is to be aware of your nutritional needs so that you plan a diet that meets them.

**[The Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada](http://www.heartandstroke.com/site/c.ikIQLcMWJtE/b.3484249/k.2F6C/Healthy_living__Vegetarian_diets.htm)**

 Vegetarian diets (*see context*) can provide all the nutrients you need at any age, as well as some additional health benefits. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Our current treatment of other animals will certainly be seen as barbaric in the future. We are learning more and more that many other animals possess sophisticated inner lives, that they are capable of using tools, learning from and teaching one another, and complex communication. Intelligent animals like pigs undoubtedly experience intense suffering, boredom, and pain as a result of their treatment on contemporary farms.

Just as the past couple centuries has seen our circle of compassion extending to include far greater rights for women and people of differing races, the future will hold greater consideration for the suffering of other species as well. </TEXT>

If your concern is over the fact that you don't want to be eaten by other predatory animals, clearly the risk of this will not change simply because humans choose to eat more plant-based foods.

The "food chain" should not be the source we use to determine how to live ethically. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Do you think dairy farms actually keep cows around until they die of old age? Cows' milk production drops off as they age. Every dairy farm sends cows to slaughter.

[From Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_cattle):

Domestic cows can live to 20 years, however those raised for dairy rarely live that long, as the average cow is removed from the dairy herd around age four and marketed for beef.

On top of this cows, like all mammals, only produce significant amounts of milk for a period after they have had a calf (they are inseminated on dairy farms to have about one calf per year according to Wikipedia). The male calves are of no use to the dairy industry, and are typically slaughtered for veal. So the slaughter of cattle is also supported in that sense by dairy consumption. </TEXT>
