	<TEXT> I disagree on it's easy. When I walk out a bar in Japan, I have a choice of taking a train, bus or cab home and they will all be there waiting for me within minutes. That doesn't happen in the US and when you've been drinking, preparing for alternative transportation usually is not on the top of your thoughts.

That being said, it's no excuse to drink and drive. I simple made the statement because even with tougher laws, I don't think the US would see the same dramatic drop in people not breaking the law due to it not being easy to find other transportation. But even a small drop would be fine by me. </TEXT>

What is nice is he seems to have principles which I just don't see in the others running for office. It would be nice if he could garner the Internet support that Ron Paul has and although I have been silent on this thus far, I will do my part to help from this point forward (and hope that others here on Reddit who believe he is the best candidate of the bunch will do the same)
