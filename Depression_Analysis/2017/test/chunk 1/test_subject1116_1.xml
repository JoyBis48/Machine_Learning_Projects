	<TEXT> Pretty similar wr group in a 16 teamer, except I have Fitz instead of Cruz. I actually got Marshall and Blackmon in trade. I ended up trading Moreno Steve Smith and Broyles for those 2 plus Jerome Simpson. I feel like the trade worked out well for both sides.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think it could be a misprint. Ian rappaport, on twitter, is saying that he's getting an mri on his foot. Either way we still have to wait for more info.  </TEXT>

From rotoworld:
"That's not the way it was presented to me," Coughlin said. The Giants' coach gave a "vague timeline" on Wilson's return at 3-4 weeks, although none of this really matters until Wilson gets a second opinion on his neck during Monday's visit with specialist Dr. Robert Watkins. Wilson owners should still fear the worst, but keep Wilson rostered until the Watkins results are known </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I wouldn't say RB2 just yet.  This was the first game that the giants oline looked competent but that could just be a result of the bears defense being incompetent.  Also Andre Brown should be back from his injury after the giants bye.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Dude get over it.  It is just fantasy football, this on the other hand is a pretty serious and career threatening diagnosis.  Show some empathy. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is my internal dilemma.  As much as I love technology, I know whatever I decide to buy will just promote a business model that includes exploiting another human being.  The only way to stop this is to just not buy from companies who are complicit in this type of behavior. And that is why I've started to purchase second hand items.  It doesn't directly support firms who allow for these awful working conditions, I end up buying the product  at a cheaper price, and I'm not being completely wasteful and adding demand for a new product that really isn't that much different than the one that came before it.  

Also is there a site or subreddit that keeps track of companies that force their workers to work in such awful conditions? Is there a site or subreddit that keeps track of the companies that do the exact opposite and pay their employees respectable wages or even living wages for producing all these consumer goods?

EDIT: And this is why I also don't necessarily bitch about prices on products.  There is a limit I am willing to spend on something but bitching about prices is just silly.  The price of a product is a derivative of its cost and demand.  If I want to buy something new that is cheap it most likely means that the cost of labor associated to it is cheap, which in turn means that person or people who created this product are most likely not being paid a sufficient amount to make the item. </TEXT>
