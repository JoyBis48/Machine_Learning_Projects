	<TEXT> ...would they be injecting the water if they weren't fracking? 

And could they frack as cheaply without injecting the water somewhere? If so, why don't they? 

It just seems arbitrary for the public to make the distinction between the fracking process and the fracking wastewater disposal process causing the quakes. It's not like the latter happens without the former... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's probably the stupidest argument I've ever heard. 

And I've spent a lot of time on reddit, so that's really saying something. 

It's like saying "If smoking causes cancer, why don't terrorists just start giving out cigarettes!? Since they're not, obviously smoking doesn't cause cancer!"  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> From a [comment 10 minutes ago, in this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/35l2mw/whats_causing_texas_earthquakes_fracking_most/cr5ro87?context=3): 

When they stop fracking the quakes stop, when they start fracking the quakes start again. It can't be a coincidence. The other day we had a 4.0 the other day and we have had some gas mains explode because of this and people lost their lives and their homes. Our gas mains are old and need replaced before they can handle all the movement.

How, then, does it make sense to build NEW fossil fuel infrastructure? 

It's like your doctor telling you to go on a diet, and instead you sign up for a rewards card at Cinnabon. 

And I don't think anyone (well informed) thinks stopping KXL will have a major effect on the industry. But it's like the divestment campaign, it's meant to revoke their social license to operate. </TEXT>

 80% of Americans  I never see 80% of Americans agreeing on anything when it comes to other issues, so this is very unusual  believe the federal government should limit greenhouse gas emissions by businesses and in particular by public utilities.
