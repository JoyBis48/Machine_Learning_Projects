	<TEXT> Yesss it's a beautiful thing. Our finals week was always the first week of the tournament...which sounds awful. But then take into consideration that I never had a final later than Tuesday afternoon for those quarters = I'm free all week to watch all the games, plus Spring Break the week after. It was pretty much perfect haha </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Point taken. You know your schedule better than I do, what quality teams have you played that are low-tempo this year? I can think of Utah and Gonzaga. Which to be fair, Gonzaga took you guys to OT at McKale where no one wins, and Utah I think is a little overrated.

I mean, that's one way to look at the strategy of a low-tempo offense. The more positive spin is that you're working to get the best possible shot and you're willing to let the shot clock run down to get that shot, working to get the little inefficiencies to stack up in your favor over the course of a possession through ball movement, cuts, and screens. The truth is probably somewhere in the middle of those two viewpoints. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Right, that's exactly what I mean. A team that's comfortable playing at a low-tempo offensively will be less dissuaded by Arizona slowing them down, especially if that team is still efficient offensively, like Northern Iowa is.

Agree with you about Stanley Johnson though. You need him going. Entirely different team based on how he's playing. </TEXT>

Love Roger's ability to capture small perfect moments. And he's intelligent without pretension. I'll finish this one quickly I think.

**Six Rivers, by Peter Coates**

Super interesting history of six influential rivers around the world. It's slow reading, and designed to tell stories that are river-centric rather than anthropocentric, giving the river agency, that kinda thing. It's interesting stuff.

	<TEXT> Gotcha, better than a lot of people dismissing em out of hand!

Hard to judge the Waves against Gonzaga because they just don't have the size to matchup effectively. They got killed in both matchups by Wiltjer (6'10") and Sabonis (6'10"). And those losses were by a combined 10 points.

I don't wanna say they're excusable losses for BYU, just that Pepperdine is a lot better than most sub-100 teams. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thing is, Duke also plays at a fast tempo and is used to riding their horses for heavy minutes at that pace. West Virginia and VCU don't score enough to keep up with Duke unless they shoot the lights out of the ball, which is always the great equalizer of the NCAA Tournament (see: Norfolk State-Mizzou. God that game still blows my mind)

If Duke loses to someone outside this group, it's gonna be because they just didn't play defense. All of their losses are that way. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The thing about these teams is that it wouldn't surprise me at all if all 7 of them made the Elite 8. There are no real matchup nightmares for any of these teams outside this group, because they're all damn good teams.

I guess I'd say Arizona doesn't want to face another low-tempo team who's big enough to match up with them but also efficient on offense. Both the MVC teams come to mind. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's a fair enough point haha. It's also probably unfair to assume that if you were in the Final Four you guys would still look like you have lately.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Say what you want about him, the man makes a great drinking game if he's calling a matchup you don't care (that much) about.

1. Take a drink every time he disagrees with a call.
2. Take 2 drinks every time he says something is "ridiculous".
3. Take 3 drinks every time he brings up the NCAA.
4. Finish your drink every time he proposes a rule change.


Seriously though I like Bilas for the reasons that have been laid out here already. The man knows hoops and is refreshingly free from a lot of the media narratives about teams. Don't always agree with him, but always want to hear what he has to say. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Pepperdine is underrated. Definitely not there yet, but the building blocks are there. Have you actually seen them play? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I hate the Seattle pod in the East. Northern Iowa and Butler, two smaller schools who could legitimately make a regional final if things broke the right way? And two of the more dangerous mid-major teams in the country in Valpo and Murray State?

FUCK YOU SAME POD.

Seriously all 4 of those teams could win a game in the tournament, if not two or three. I know it's all done on bracketing principles but I'd be so bummed if that was a real pod in two weeks. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Wofford yes. Baylor is playing great basketball right now, and really have flown under the radar all year. Pretty much the only reason people look at them like an upset candidate is Scott Drew, which is lazy thinking. He's been proving he's not a joke for awhile now. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Kind of an aside, but the Rays are building our old bullpen out in Tampa haha. Jepsen is obviously out there, but they signed Frieri and Kohn too.

Obviously now that Zobrist is in Oakland they look a lot better though, which is frustratingly predictable. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Only thing about Goodreads is that Amazon bought it not too long ago, and the recommendations are now generated off of that platform. So you'll get basically what Amazon thinks you'll like. Other than that, Goodreads is good stuff. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Cowart has been done for a while now in the eyes of the organization. Kubitza had a .405 OBP at AA last year too. And that's with a high strikeout rate apparently. This is the guy we're looking at as our 2016 3B. </TEXT>
