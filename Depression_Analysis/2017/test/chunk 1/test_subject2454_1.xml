	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> A lot of them have trouble traveling due to visa issues or whatever.  So, could it be possible to have a fighter that simply does not fight in the US?  With as many international shows as the company puts on, many countries have much more relaxed visa programs than the United States, so it would allow a fighter to build up a resume against top quality opponents on international cards.

Why couldn't Glover fight in London, Abu Dhabi, Australia, Canada, or Japan (and of course, Brazil) in the last two years under a UFC contract while his U.S. status was being sorted out? </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2012-07-11 20:11:50 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Iran is a shia country which claims to follow Shariah law.  But whenever they enact a new law, or carry out a severe punishment of an existing law under the guise of Sharia, most muslims will say "They are shia, so it doesn't count, etc..."

My question is this:  Is Shia sharia so severely differnt than sunni shariah?  Most of the differences in the two sects are historical and are based on theories of succession after the death of the prophet.  So how does this make their laws any different?

When they execute adulterers/whatever, is it not the same sharia law followed and understood by sunnis?

I understand that there are some serious differences in beliefs.  But the laws carried out by Iranian authorities rarely reflect those differences; rather they are laws which are held by both sunnis and shias.

If I am wrong, please correct me </TEXT>

TLDR:  Just wanted to know why you guys are fans of these guys.

There are a lot of good links to videos and articles in this subreddit that don't get the attention they deserve because there are just too few of us.  We want /r/atheism to join our cause, but we don't want to get meme'd to death.  

So why not cross post all the good articles and videos from here to that sub?  Are there rules against this?  </TEXT>

My question is, for weight loss, is this as good as p90x?  The reason I ask is because I am very intimidated by p90x, and I believe that I must do another, less intense bootcamp before attempting p90x.  Especially because of the cardio and pull ups.

This Les Mills Pump workout seems to be all weigh lifting, all the time.  I know the guys at r/fitness would probably like it because they pretty much rail against cardio whenever they can, so I came to ask you guys. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It used to be that in order to be best-of'd, someone would be providing some great insight into an unknown subject matter for a curious redditor, or some great act of kindness that went unnoticed.


Now, it just seems like every pun thread, or even slightly funny joke gets posted here, as if the OPs want credit for finding some hidden secret of reddit that no one else on the entire internet has seen.

But I guess such is the say of reddit.  After seeing the downfall of Insanity Wolf, r/WTF, and r/trees, we shouldn't expect anything less. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Gegard Mousasi and King Mo come to mind.  I remember a few years ago people were talking about a Mousasi-Machida superfight.  Would that kind of fight be beneficial to both guys?  What about King Mo?  Being a former Strikeforce champion has to earn some cred in the UFC, right? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Especially with modern electric and ultrasonic brushes that seemingly do as much as dentist tools, it would seem that toothpaste is nothing more than polish.

Do we actually need toothpaste? </TEXT>
