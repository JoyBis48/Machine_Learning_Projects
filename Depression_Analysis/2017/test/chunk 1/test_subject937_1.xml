	<TITLE> Rep. Barrow's Response to my Inquiry on Net Neutrality </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-05-23 19:00:55 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Dear [test_subject937],

Thank you for contacting me about net neutrality.

I oppose any form of censorship or discrimination. I believe those who pay for our web capacity must be able to recover their costs, or it won't get built.

Supporters of net neutrality argue that giving all internet users the highest speed and greatest volume of space available - whether or not they contribute to the cost of building that capacity - is the only way to guarantee that no one will be discriminated against on the basis of what they want to say. However, there is very little incentive for carriers to build infrastructure if they have no way to recoup their costs. Without such an incentive, many new high bandwith applications, such as medical technology and communications for emergency personnel, many not be feasible.

Simply put, I believe providers shouldn't be able to block access to any other providers on the basis of content, and access to the capacity that has been built by the public should be open to the public on equal terms. But, access to future capacity should be open on equal terms to those who share the cost of its construction.

Thanks again for caring enough to get involved, and please don't hesitate to contact me again in the future.

Sincerely,

John Barrow </TEXT>

Also, I have Google Maps on the home row and it is removed every time it reboots. All the other slots are folders so I'm not sure if that's the cause or if it is something specific to Google Maps. </TEXT>

Is there a way that it is/can be used that is not a cop out? In my experience, it is usually said by someone who doesn't want to be tied to the social platform of the Republican party, but more so doesn't want to be thought of as a liberal or a Democrat.

I've thought this for years and am genuinely curious that I am missing something. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Bottom line is as it appears: what can be done here? My cousin is such a good person - but she has decided that his lack of belief in the Christian god is a deal breaker.

I'm asking for effective advice... he wants to be with her. He does not want her to "convert" to his "religion"; but she is demanding the same.

Is this fair? And what can be done (in good faith)? </TEXT>

Does reaching the front page reduce this tendency? Front page fame is not worthless; fame a second time is still something.

	<TEXT> We were trying to destroy resonators by a museum around midnight. They saw my parked car and got out to investigate. At this point, I don't think they knew we were there. 

We approached them and they asked what we were up to. We showed them the phone and explained that it is a global game of capture the flag created by Google. That simple explanation dropped the tension level down dramatically (they didn't know what they were walking into until then). 

They laughed and checked it out a bit. Told us not to get "attacked" ourselves, and went on their way. 

Overall, it was a good experience. We told them that they might start seeing more people like us and it's just a game.  </TEXT>

Now I legitimately get the the two versions confused and have to pause and mentally say it before verbally saying it. </TEXT>

But I distinctly remember one of my best friends in college needing a definition from me when I used the term to describe Saddam Hussein's regime.

She is very intelligent and well-educated, which only made it that much more perplexing to me.

So, Reddit, what other examples are there? </TEXT>
