	<TEXT> Looking for non-rooted stuff, GO Backup came up as an app that will save your contacts, messages and apps. Must have root to save app data, but if all you need is a way to easily save and re-install favorite apps it seems good enough. Lots of other options if you do a little searching. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, and it isn't even complete. I use Titanium Backup myself, and there are other options for restoring favorites.

But if you want to re-download favorite apps from the play store, try this...

Click the My Android Apps tab

Scroll to the bottom of the screen and click My Orders   Settings

There you'll find your most recent downloads/purchases. Keep in mind it shows all store stuff, so books, music, ect. will be there as well. And if you click the settings in there you can adjust your device list.

SPB Shell was a *really* nice launcher for showing off my phone. The idle screen is unparalleled. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, I'm digging the whole ICS experience myself atm. But I've been using Holo over the other ICS launchers. I was using Apex so I could put widgets in the dock, but they're just unsightly there. With Holo I can still put folders in the dock (which gets rid of my need for Folder Organizer) and I'm loving the app drawer. The favorites tab is my goto spot to launch apps from.
The current favs atm for ICS seem to be Apex and Nova. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Meh, no. If the ads look like Resident Evil to me, I'm pretty turned off. I'm sure it's "not the same game at all", but it's rare that a FPS game can grab me. Or worse yet, a third person view when you simply shift from target to target with an auto-aim. They all really get monotonous.

I'm pretty hooked on the MMORPGs. I've tried tons of them, paid and free (and there ARE a ton of them.) Dealing with people makes for a much richer experience to me. (For whatever reason, the biggest one, WoW, bores the hell out of me though.) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Capital One is probably the biggest credit card company. And if you can't get one there yet, get a secured card, by someone like Orchard Bank. Capital One will send you an invite soon if you balance that one well.

If you get a card, use it. Put 30 bucks a month or so on it, or just use it for gas, or something like that. Don't just start using it for shopping. You can quickly get pulled under, then the charges start.

And make sure you pay it off on time, every month. Finance charges are how they make their money, and they make a LOT of money. Those charges will be like throwing your money out the window while you drive down the road.

If you find out you don't have the self-control to use a card wisely, then cancel it quick, and stick with a secured one. 

Just google around a bit for credit advice. You'll see the smart tips being repeated if you spend the time to really dive into it.

And JReitman is right. Don't use them if you don't have the cash to cover them. </TEXT>
