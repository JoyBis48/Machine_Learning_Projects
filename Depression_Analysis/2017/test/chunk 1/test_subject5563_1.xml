	<TEXT> It was also titled [Star Wars Underworld](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Star_Wars:_Underworld) it seemed to have a pretty awesome premise. 

"Basically, it is like 'The Godfather'; its the Empire slowly building up its power base around the galaxy, what happens in Coruscant, which is the major capital, and its [about] a group of underground bosses who live there and control drugs, prostitution..."
Rick McCallum

Personally I think it would be an amazing on HBO if they put in a similar 10 episode season like they do with Game of Thrones with a similar budget as well, however the chances of that happening are nil since Disney own the ABC network which they would most likely produce it on. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Look i'm sure that the production of ANY tv show is not "lazy" but don't you think in Australia  that all the free to air networks in Australia are over-saturated with reality tv shows? It seems like every network is just chasing after each other when one network has a successful reality show. Just my 2 cents as tv viewer. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I actually think this would fit Ridley Scott perfectly, combined with a good screenplay of course *cough Prometheius cough*. If the film follows the first game and is set in the 12 century I feel that he could absolutely nail the look and feel of the setting as well as the sci fi elements. For reference I think people should check out the directors cut for Kingdom of Heaven as it is set roughly in the same time period as AC1 and gives a good vision for what he could achieve. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was originally like you and asked myself whether the show would be too childish etc. Then I decided to watch it from season 1 to 6 and honestly it is fantastic. Sure there are a few dud episodes and some story arcs that appeal more to children than adults but the underlying theme of darkness is present throughout the series and man does it get dark especially in the latter seasons. Seriously do yourself a favour and watch it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think of the ratings as more of a guideline. I was fortunate that my mum or dad didn't care about what I played too much and was able to get away with some pretty gnarly games at a young age. For example I got GTA 3 on PS2 when I was in Year 4 of primary school. I look back on it know as my parents being a bit naive but also as a sign of trust in that they raised me correctly and made me work for these games. I'm not saying that your mum is completely wrong in not getting you the game but I think showing that you can handle mature themes, ideas and concepts which transcend the idea of these artificial ratings, it will go along way with your mum. My 2 cents though I'm sure many people may disagree with me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Sony have already said that the price of the PS4 was not finalized until E3, and that they were prepared to sell it for less than they are in order to undercut the Xbox One, which was their ultimate goal from the start. When Microsoft announced their higher-than-expected pricing, Sony execs breathed a sigh of relief. This was all discussed numerous times in a wide variety of interviews with several Sony execs. The prices were not known to anyone outside of these two companies until the announcements were made.
 

I don't think Respawn chose to make it for the Xbox One as many developers with Respawn have stated that they are upset that PS4 owners won't be able to experience the game since they want it to reach as many households as possible. It was a very corporate decision to keep it to the Xbox One.

	<TEXT> Sorry but even MS will never pay a stupidly high amount for Titanfall 2. The only reason Titanfall 1 was a console exclusive was because a former EA executive thought the Xbox One would dominate this gen. EA are pretty much kicking themselves over this though since the PS4 now has the higher install base. So essentially MS would have to pay the equivalent of what EA are losing in potential PS4 sales and that would simply be too high for MS to pay. MS would most likely want to put that money into their own IP's such as Gears or Halo where they know they will get a substantial profit instead of splitting up the portion of these profits with another company like EA if they made Titanfall 2 </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was in the exact same situation mate a few days ago. In my opinion its best if you don't lock onto the dragon and get some distance. It basically has a tell for each move its gonna do when it lies down flat it basically means its gonna charge and when it does you can easily manouver around it and get a few hits in on the tail BUT you have to be cautious because you need your stamina to gain distance again when it starts bend over again. It has a move in which it will vomit up all this acid on the ground which can spread in a rather large radius but you as long as you are far away from him you can avoid it although if you get hit it will reduce weapon durability. You can tell when he's gonna do the acid move when he starts do this regurgitating animation from what I can remember. 

Basically just don't lock onto him and keep a lot of distance and monitor how he tries to attack you. It takes a while to get his HP down when you're only attacking his back side but it's the safest way imo.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I just love the fact that they actually use the phones properly in the show. They don't super impose some stupid interface that makes silly sounds over the phone to get their point across. Instead you get the real deal. I especially love the graphics they use on screen when the characters text each other.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I felt that while season 2 was great it came a bit too early. Season 2 felt like series finale material. This is how I would have arranged the seasons. 

Start off obviously with Season 1Season 3Season 5Season 4Season 6Season 7Season 2.

Now this is how I felt the order of the show could have gone assuming that certain characters did not die. Obviously Season 8 does not exist in this and you may be able to exclude season 5 from this order as well and pretend it never happened.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> What did everyone think of A.I (Steven Spielberg film) </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-01-22 14:28:13 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> When this film came out I was about 11 years old so obviously I wasn't really clued in what people thought about the film. I know this though that when I did see it in the cinemas with my parents, I cried and it is still the only live action film which had genuinely brought a tear to my eye from what I can remember. I obviously didn't get the underlying themes or motifs that the film conveyed at the time but after watching it recently at the ripe age of 21, I gotta say I am quite surprised at how many people dislike it, I didn't really notice how divisive the film was at its release. 

So what how do you fine people feel about A.I? Is it a masterpiece or is it one of Spielberg's missteps? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi guys now first and foremost I am not a heavy drinker at all, I am only 21 and studying at university so I only drink heavy on occasion to celebrate or party etc, now I am not looking to make fun or offend anyone here but my main question is why do people turn to alcohol? The reason for this is alcohol in itself tastes pretty nasty in my opinion. As in spirits like Vodka, Whiskey and other hard liquors. Do you guys mix alcohol or just drink beer etc? This is purely out of curiosity I am not looking to berate or offend anyone here. I sincerely hope that those of you who do indeed suffer from an addiction to alcohol that you overcome it!

	<TEXT> Watched a horror film when I was really young, sometime in the mid 90s (the movie may have been reeleased prior) and it involved this female bride going turning into a monster and killing people. The only scene I vaguely remember was that of the bride walking along the side-walk and she comes across this kid playing a violin and then proceeds to kill him or injure him. Sorry that I cannot remember much of the film at all. It would be of great help to find the title of this film. Thanks.  </TEXT>
