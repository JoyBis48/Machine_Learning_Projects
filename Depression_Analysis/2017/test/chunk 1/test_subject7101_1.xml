	<TEXT> lag has always been a issue with the game but i ever had it as badly as i am now after the latest update

horrendously lagging like a son of a bitch causing me to die a lot (even losing a 250 combo just before the boss!!!)

	<TEXT> just noticed that the bronze medal is 50 ISO-8 (100-999th place)

you need to get over 2 million to get it though i got 1.7 million yesterday and made it 740th place by the morning i was down to about 1100-1200th place

quite hard for me to get more than 2 million with a 28 multiplier but at least the chance to win a lot is ISO is back </TEXT>

	<TEXT> it's a waste of ISO-8 IMO but if you have the money to burn it will be at the bottom of the screen if you don't have the necessary card for it

if i'm not mistaken it's like 200 ISO-8 to rank up a six star spider.. that much ISO-8 could buy you 16 discount premium portals </TEXT>

	<TEXT> most games like this don't do it for the powerups especially when the vials have no other use (as of yet)

the game already makes you use premium currency to buy the portals which is the most important thing to upgrade your spiderman..

you have to use a lot of it if you're unlucky like me and never get the spider you need </TEXT>

	<TEXT> got to the point where i bought the 80,000 vial upgrade only to realise if you want to upgrade it again you need to spend ISO-8

what is the point of vials if you can't upgrade the powerups all the way? literally that's all the vials can buy (except when you spend 500 when you want to waste a useless spiderman to add more xp to another)

why couldn't they of just made them even more expensive (like 160,000 vials then 250k or whatever.. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> they changed the rank required for silver medal it's now 10-99 (bronze is 100-9999) not only impossible for those with lower multipliers but a bit unfair on people who get high scores that get screwed over with a bronze medal

i think they increased it because it's 50 ISO-8 but it's hard to achieve
i wouldn't mind if it was less ISO-8 so more people could actually have a chance to earn it </TEXT>

	<TEXT> i hate the rank up system in the game and have been playing nothing but events lately because i've hit a road block needing a level 35 spiderman to continue.. 

even that sucks because there is a few people with level 90 spiderman that i have no chance to match their scores of 1-3 million with my level 30 spiderman with a much lower score multiplier 

game is massively geared to get you to pay for iso-8 for instant rank up or to get the right premium spiderman to continue </TEXT>

	<TEXT> downloaded it the other day it was fun at first but when you get up to the missions that require a level 35 spiderman the game gets ridiculous

the amount of iso-8 you need to level up is ridiculous and you got to be lucky to get 4-5 of the same premium card and another 2 to level them up

obviously geared to get people to pay otherwise it would take months to even get enough (other endless runner games aren't this bad)

takes away from the fun of the game when you hit a roadblock like this

	<TEXT> i hate when games put big events out so soon, events need to be spaced out so you don't get tired of the game and this one most likely will be similar to the last with collect x to get y or spend a zillion clams to get it now..

too many events so soon and you get burned out on the game (especially since many are probably still unlocking stewie or trying to get the toy boxes) </TEXT>
