	<TITLE> HWI: In 1952 after the Chinese got involved in the Korean War, the USA starts blanket bombing campaigns, and deploying nuclear weapons against the borders of the (now) northern DPRK borders. </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Also, large cities in China are targeted for hydrogen bomb drops.  Civilian populations are directly targeted, and Shanghai and Beijing are reduced to radioactive rubble several times over.  Fields and rice patties are targeted for massive bombing campaigns with napalm, and WP bombs.

The USA attacks DPRK, and China with the full force of the military, and we do not relent until they are pounded into complete and utter devastation and defeat. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> ELI5: Why do Americans seem so restrained and offended by "cussing", but other English speaking countries aren't? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-03-12 10:57:17 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Such as on American TV, they can't even say "piss", "shit" "damned", "hell", or "bastard" without getting bleeped out, and if you say "the lord's name in vain in public, you'll get dirty looks.

But on British TV that I watch, (yes, it's BBC News, and BBC America), they don't seem to care at all.  They'll use them all day long, and nobody gives a shit.  Australlian TV is even more liberal.  They even include the heavy cuss words like "fuck" and "cunt".

So what's up with the cultural differences?  Why are Americans so puritanicall with language, and don't seem to realize that saying "gosh dang it" is just G rated substitution for "god damn it", and "Shut the front door!" is a substitute for "Shut the fuck up!"?  Everybody knows what is being said.  But some words have magical offending properties, while others do not. 

Please explain.

**EDIT:**  I'm surprised "douchebag" is allowed on TV, and "ass" and "hole" are, but "asshole" is not, (on American TV). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't care if it's in Pullman or Moscow, (I work in Moscow though).  I would LIKE a 2bdrm 1 ba (1 for my bedroom, one for a shop/cat room). But a 1bdrm 1 ba would be adequate.  (Yes, I want the cat to have her own room).  Bedrooms are typically fine with the lighting in every place I've had, but I like natural light in the kitchen and bathroom.  (save on energy bills).  It must be pet friendly.  Are there apartments like that around here?  I have one cat.  

Glendimier would suit me, but I don't like that the bathroom doesn't appear to have a fart fan, or any natural lighting, and the kitchen doesn't have any natural lighting.  What options do I have around here? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Went to WM to get soda and dinner, and went through the self-checkout. Those machines are SLOW! I was trying to haul ass like I do at work, but I was faster than the damned machine. It's like they design it for people who don't know what the hell they are doing, and have no realistic expectations of speed.

They need to crank up the response time of those machines. I hate going slow in the checkout lane. Cashiering at WM has taught me how to haul ass doing it, and having to slow down because the machine can't keep up is annoying! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I know like 3 "phrases" in ASL, (4 if you count the middle finger), but in "universal sign language", language barriers simply don't seem to matter.  While I know not *exactly* what is trying to be communicated, I can get the gist of it.  So why was ASL ever formed in the first place, since "universal sign language" works fine 90+% of the time? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Sick of retail </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-02-12 16:10:10 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Looking for a new job. No I didn't get canned. I still have the job for as long as I want it, (realistically). I'm just getting tired of the irregular shifts, the inadequate hours, having to schedule myself, and dumb-ass customers who don't know where a buggy is even if I hit them in the ass with it. I've filled out a job app, and I'm wanting out of WM.

If I had 40+ per week, with a regular schedule, and didn't have to do 5 GOD DAMNED JOBS just to get SOMETIMES CLOSE to 40 hours a week, If I didn't have to work 6 days a week, and if I didn't have an irregular schedule, I would LOVE WM! But all of those things haven't happened, so I'm looking for new work.

If I'm successful in getting the job that I'm now applying for, I will like it better than WM. I'll be working M-F, with a REGULAR SCHEDULE and A REGULAR WEEKEND! I WANT THIS JOB! I'm getting sick of retail. Realistically, I'm getting tired of the shitty work situation. I'll give them a 3 week's notice, because I want to finish out my schedule, and give them adequate time to hire my replacement.

To quit immediately would be rude, and I would burn more bridges than it's worth. If I do get this job, it will be the first job I quit in my adult life, instead of getting fired from it. I just want out. I want a regular job, with a regular schedule, doing a regular job. I'm tired of working 5 jobs at 1 employer just to get CLOSE to 40 hours. I also miss O/T. Can't do that at WM!

A lot has changed in 10 years. The last time I worked at WM, I could put in 70 hour weeks, and nobody cared. Now, if I get 40.03 hours, I get a verbal warning to watch the clock. Can't do it. Can't work over 40, or I get my ass chewed. Sick of it. I want out. </TEXT>
