	<TEXT> Rome- Seat of the Roman Empire, seat of the Papacy and center of ancient and medieval Europe.

New York- A hub of international trade almost since the discovery of the New World, and currently the seat of the UN.

Athens- Less so for being an important city and more so for the scholars it produced, namely Aristotle, Plato and Socrates. </TEXT>
