	<TEXT> The last time I watched SSY, I think my mind was spinning from everything that happens in the end that the impact was lost a little bit. This time I'm determined to watch it properly! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's taken my second watch to realise that maybe Yakomaru/Squealer's shift in name has deeper meaning than his new, recognised autonomy and authority. When he was named Squealer, he was cowardly and seemingly sold Saki and Satoru out. He's almost literally squealing to save his own skin. 

I don't really know how to feel about Squealer/Yakomaru even now that I've almost finished rewatching SSY... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Arguably one of the more interesting characters in Shinsekai Yori, I thought it would be awesome to see what other people thought of him. What do you think of the change in his personality? Do you think he was plotting everything from the start? 

This discussion is to be strictly about Squealer/Yakomaru so spoilers are fine. I mean, it's a bit hard not to discuss a character without talking about everything they've done, right?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've nearly finished watching Shinsekai Yori and I'm just blown away by the impact it has. Like you, it's leaving me deep in thought and I can't help but feel really...dark. SSY isn't a happy anime by any stretch and I think it's meant to really challenge its audience. Ultimately, I think it makes us think a lot about human nature, and nature of ethics. It's hard not to find myself thinking about not only the characters and the plot, but the deeper themes of the anime as well. SSY is probably the best anime I've ever seen.  </TEXT>
