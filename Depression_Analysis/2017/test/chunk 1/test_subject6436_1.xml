	<TEXT> Language is the greatest invention of mankind but it is also our biggest brainwasher. I like to close my eyes and think of ideas, abstract concepts,and thought experiments through visualization.
It uses a different part of the brain than language
 This overcomes the limations and creative blocks that language puts my the mind under. I invented several ideas with  this method. Tesla use to do this. Would be neat , but not sure how possible, if in the future visualization could be incorporated into language. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think the way to fix our campaign finance laws is for there to be a law that states only a US citizen can give money for the campaign of his/her district.

No donations from international organizations like corporations or unions allowed.   </TEXT>

Many health related issues that where considered fact in the past  are now called into question. Also, the genes of humanity are not monolithic. Some people have rare adverse reactions too things of which the reason is not currently understood. For this reason, labeling and having GMO free places too eat like Chipotle is a good thing. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Many people say " I don't do anything wrong so why should I care".
There was a film about east germany when it was communist. In the movie, one of the local party bosses had the hots for the wife of one of the films characters . He told the secret service to spy on him to find some "dirt" on him so he could lock him up and have his way with his wife. He couldn't find anything so he used the private information of his phone conversations to frame him. 
" Power corrupts" and " absolute power corrupts absolutely ".
So get a warrent unless you want to live in a police state. If you don't think this couldn't happen in the United States your fooling yourself. Would you like all your phone calls keep in a central database where even your local sheriff could listen to them. This is where this is heading in the future if not stopped. </TEXT>
