Look, my point was if there was an unfortunate series of events, the TCAS is the last hope to avoid a collision. 

Without their transponder operational, TCAS is useless.

I'm not saying they ever got close enough to cause this, or ever intended to but having their transponder off in such an environment (around civvie aircraft) is reckless, surely you could agree to that. </TEXT>

TCAS has and will continue to saves lives should the absolute worst happen, and while the Russians may be stellar points, murphy's law dictates everyone can fuck up, and having your transponder on can avoid turning a mistake into anything worse. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The point is they required flights to be diverted away, which means they were enough of a threat -close enough to to an air corridor to warrant be a threat.

Of course you *can* fly without a transponder anywhere in the world, however if you're going to do it next to/around a busy commercial air corridor expect trouble.. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The reason they had to be escorted away immediately is because the world has a very effective and proven collision avoidance system, but but it relies on an active [transponder](http://http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_collision_avoidance_system) which the douchebags had turned off. 

Do you really think this would have been so funny if a commercial airliner collided with one of these guys because that was a real possibility.

You can't just fly in international airspace without your transponder on, that is just incredibly arrogant and puts lives at risk. 

Of course they knew this was going to happen the moment they flew into commercial airspace. 

For fucks sake why are they risking an international disaster by bringing down an airliner in a mid air collision while the world is itching for an excuse to start WW3? </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Ok, this has happened 3 times now so I know it can't be just me. this is irregardless of power saving, screen brightness and there are no errant wakelocks (using Wakelock Detector via PC Developer mode as not support by KitKat.)

Brand new phone stats:
   
***Brand new Samsung S4 i9506***

    4 hours Screen-On-Time, 12+ hours standby.

***Battery life at 6 months:***
    
    2 hours SOT -8 hours standby.
    
***Did a factory reset:***
   
    4 hours SOT 12 hours awake.

***3 months later:***
        
    2 hours SOT, 8 hours standby.

***Another factory reset:***
   
    4 hours SOT, 12 hours+ standby.

***3 months ago now:***
   
    2 hours SOT, -8 hours standby.   

***Last weekend back again:***

    4 hours SOT, 12 hours+ standby

TL:DR battery life is significantly enhanced by a factory reset even if same Apps are installed immediately afterwards. Why is this? </TEXT>

Or companies transferring information that could bring down corporations.

If back doors exists they are a weakness, which can be exploited and will be by both governments and whoever is either smart or lucky enough to stumble upon it.

In short fuck off, leave us alone and stop treating everyone like damn terrorists, cause that's working so well for you so far ay?

Secondly don't link to it with the main header, as that just piques your interest into downloading it, which rather defies the original purpose of the post.

Based upon the above my comment still stands however based upon my opinion formed. 

As you're educated on the subject I understand where you're coming from and it must be frustrating to read comments like mine, but let's be honest here, it's not likely to change as the media aren't going to change how they report things of this nature - e.g. "anticorruption measure" stories will get buried amongst stories about corrupt officials each and every time, so can you blame me?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm saying the country as a whole is very average - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption_in_India

"..But many analysts believe India's sprawling bureaucracy and weak institutionsthe police and judiciary were ranked as the second and third most corrupt institutions in India, respectively, after political partieshave thwarted convictions, and arguably increased incentives for bribery. In recent years, graft pervaded society from small-scale "harassment bribes" (payments for essential social services) to scandals on a national level. At least 42 percent of young Indians have paid a bribe, according to a 2012 Hindustan survey"
[source](http://www.cfr.org/corruption-and-bribery/governance-india-corruption/p31823)

And I specifically refer to the corrupt judge's trial - http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/bribery-charges-trial-against-judge-may-finally-begin/article4978237.ece

And now this, which the high court has thrown out as clearly some very dodgy motions were passed without due diligence. </TEXT>

Also flicking between front and back screens causes the camera to freeze for around 2 seconds.

Also changing to and from Video - camera mode causes screen to freeze, need to escape it and get back in.

And HD video quality is piss poor when pixel peeping vs stock Samsung S4.

On the PLUS side, takes very nice HDR photos. </TEXT>

Edit: Actually it is a much better low-light camera than the standard App, (Samsung S4) as it focuses better, and with the HDR mode always on, offers an advantage over the HDR mode over the Stock S4 camera as HDR has to be selected everytime, through a rather clunky menu. 

Very good, and hell, it's free so always a worth a shot! </TEXT>

Very light on the battery life. 
Very easy to use/learn but hard to master.
Each "game" only takes around 4-5 minutes.

What I especially like is the ability to pause in game, and in the case of my S4, I can leave it running in the background and send a txt message, and then using task manager go back to my paused game.
