	<TEXT> There has to be some angle in this decision. Surely he's not ACTUALLY thinking he's above Rick's group and their decisions. He still carries the guilt of the people he left to die AND he knows he would be dead if it wasn't for Grimes and Co. So I'm thinking there's another angle that we just aren't seeing yet. Thoughts? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I saw this movie as a kid and absolutely loved it. Watched again as an adult and still am drawn to quoting it and singing along. Chevy Chase, Steve Martin and Martin Short are perfect in this movie. I don't see this movie mentioned very much, but I recommend it to ANYONE who hasn't seen it.  </TEXT>
