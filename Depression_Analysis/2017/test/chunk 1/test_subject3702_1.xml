	<TEXT> False. I am talking about that word being used as a general pejorative.

Your argument is based on the idea that this word is no longer a homophobic slur. That is patently false.

you contradict yourself to make a point, and then you mention honesty about the meaning of the word. I don't know what this honesty is meant to refer to, a literal definition of the word or its connotations? 
The use of faggot as a pejorative is an augmentation of its once literal definition anyway. And emotional reactions to the word have everything to do it. If the word Faggot didn't inspire negative emotions in people then we wouldn't be having this conversation to begin with. 

and a correction: I know the word still can be used as a homophobic slur, that's not my argument. I'm saying that it is also taking on a new meaning, one that denotes -- as you said -- a general pejorative. Not a specific homophobic slur. 

EDIT: and for these reasons, you're argument is tautological. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The use of homophobic slurs is homophobic.

The argument: that this use of the word in a certain context is in fact not homophobic.

Your argument assumes the correctness of "faggot" always being used as a homophobic slur. It even goes so far as to imply that if **both** user and target have reached an agreement previously to not treat "faggot" as homophobic, but instead as part of their vocabulary of playful denigration, it still is a homophobic slur. 

If this were the case, all words would remain static. This is clearly not so. Also, I think it's pretty clear that a community such as reddit is by nature very opposed to homophobia. This establishes a sort of redefinition of what it means to use words previously defined as homophobic slurs. 

AND, one more thing. Words are words and only people give them power to hurt. If you treat "faggot" with such seriousness, it only deems the word necessary when spouting vitriol. Much like the word nigger has been used. The best thing to do is use the word with utter farce, lampoon it's own hateful meaning.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ok, I'm sorry. 

But the people on here telling you to confront your mother and threaten to tell your father can go fuck themselves. Well, perhaps not that. But I think it is the wrong way to approach the situation. This is based off of the principle that this is none of your business. Just be an adult and talk to her. Keep it between you and her. Get her perspective. It is most likely the case that there is some dynamic between your father and mother that is completely unknown to you. Affairs happen, this is just part of real life. Don't go bulldozing through your family just because you're too offended that your mother wants a proper dicking from some other guy.

I understand this comes across as harsh. Hopefully it isn't taken as malicious. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Again, wrong.

Modern philosophy is *not* applied psychology. What you may be referring to is Naturalized Philosophy, which is a specific branch of philosophy. And even then, it's not so much applied psychology as it is applied "let's accept some empirical facts about the world"

Modern science is by definition a conglomeration of facts based off of a philosophical framework. Much like Aristotelian physics and the geocentric model, the standard model and quantum physics. 

Not all philosophy is speculative, in the same way that some fields of scientific research *are* speculative. 

I'm not here to make value judgements. There is no "better than the other." But I'm also going to give philosophy it's credit where credit is due. A lot of people forget the history that Philosophy and Science have together. They used to be in love, you know. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is really untrue. There is fathoms more to Philosophy than  the subjectivity of the human condition. 
Not too long ago, Science was a proper branch of philosophy. 
Also, logic and analytic philosophy. These are found at the foundations of the scientific method and formally part of the philosophical tradition.

In other words, philosophy embodies almost all fields of study. Even mathematics.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> ya man, I second this. I mean, it sucks that you threw away all of your old work, but it all has to do with perspective. You could look at it in a liberating kind of way... In the sense that you're no longer bound to what you've created in the past.

This might sound like a load of bullshit. But it's either that, or live in the turmoil of knowing you don't have some stuff you made in highschool. Im not into the visual arts myself, but I have two really really good friends (one painter, one illustrator) that are both out of college. And they are both terribly embarrassed of what they did in highschool. Not in an ashamed way, just a "oh wow, I've improved so much" kind of thing. 

...So yeah, keep at it bro. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> let me tell you why this is bullshit:
There's no way the farmer can completely sustain himself. 
Let's assume he's using simple tools (hoe, axe, rake etc..) He either needs to greatly increase his work time, or greatly increase his manpower for maintenance on the farm.
If he is doing this by himself, he very little time to do anything else (harvest the crops, store them, sleep, eat, be human). 
If he has extra workers, what compensation do they receive? Let's assume there is no money, and that they are paid in the crops that are grown. Then that means more food has to be grown for each new worker we introduce. Even if none of these people had family members that didn't work on the farm this would be a challenging task.

On top of that, and I know it sounds silly, but where did he get his house, his hat, his clothes, and (in the picture) his little grill? Let's ignore the grill. How did he build his house? He doesn't have time for that he's too busy using hand tools to grow enough food for the year. Did he pay for it with crops?
Ah, so now we have some people that build houses and some people that grow vegetables. When one wants to eat, they *trade* skills for food, and vice-versa when the other needs shelter.
This extends outward, and gets increasingly complex. Which is why we have money in the first place, because in order to maintain any basic standard of living (even the most conservative) it is next to impossible to do anything without trade. And if we're trading crops for houses, we might as well have this universal medium so we can get things from people that don't want houses or crops without going through a long list of trading to get something else; say, honey, toilet paper, cars, pencils, straw hats or little tiny grills.

	<TEXT> This is actually a type of ghost. To find a pet peeve, you'll need to get your hands on a very scientific device. My guess is that most people who claim to have one are lying, as most cannot actually "see" a peeve, but must experience one. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, I feel that. If I am in to her, I usually just assume flirting. Flirting and friendliness can be very similar anyway. Just because I girl is flirting with you doesn't mean she's going to have sex with you. </TEXT>
