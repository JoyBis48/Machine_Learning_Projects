	<DATE> 2015-02-16 19:07:39 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> 1. Hypothesis: "Harry" is a trigger that brings back his memories when said by Quirrell, which is why he never said it before.

2. Snape taught at Hogwarts for 7 years. Harry is 11, and was 1 when his parents died. Snape only came to Hogwarts 3 years after Voldemort disappeared, which is 3 years later than in canon. See http://www.hp-lexicon.org/timelines/timeline_snape.html, which sources this from canon. This is probably significant.

3. I'd like to mention my last theories thread, which didn't get much attention because it was posted right before the new chapter. https://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2w0xiz/last_crazy_thread_before_it_updates_spoilers_102/

4. I think Snape is being controlled by Quirrell also, as I don't expect Sprout to be powerful enough to have downed him. Remember, everyone found it *plausible* that Snape had actually downed Quirrell in Diagon Alley, so Snape must be pretty powerful. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> last crazy thread before it updates, spoilers 102? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-02-16 01:41:55 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Here, in no particular order, are all my crazy theories/questions that I wanted to get out before the update, from my notes. Assume spoilers all:

1. Why didn't Lucius know that Harry wasn't getting his mail? He should have at least asked Draco to tell him if Harry got anything or something.
2. There's precedent for Harry's thoughts being hidden; Harry's plan to have Draco rule wasn't mentioned until he said it in the meeting (assuming it was true).
3. Why did H C talk to Zabini and then immediately obliviate him? Seems wasted.
4. Why didn't they try to test Lucius to see if he was telling the truth about the Mark?

His own Death Eaters did not know it until afterward, hence the false Mark I bear; though since I did not truly consent, it does not bind me.

Surely someone had a test that would tell whether the Mark bound him? Since they thought that the Mark sealed the lips of the bearers about itself, why didn't they demand that Lucuis tell them how the Mark worked, and test the response? This seems much simpler than Harry's thing with the actual mark.

* 5. Why is the prank when Harry learns about time-turners in his style? Presumably Harry would still cooperate with the prank regardless of whether it matched his style, so what does that tell us about how Time works?
* 6. Why didn't Lucius know at the trial that Harry could cast a patronus? He gave Draco Veritaserum, right?
* 7. Mcgonagall seems to have a *lot* of killing intent. Why?
* 8. Snape is a Legilimens, which implies he's a perfect Occlumens as well. Why did Voldemort think he could trust the prophecy that he took out of his mind?

I omitted a few that I couldn't figure out they meant. Need to take clearer notes to make time-travel communication easier ... </TEXT>

	<TITLE> What I think will happen (spoilers even if you've read all) </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-02-08 17:35:22 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> The first time I read through HPMOR (until chapter 101), I really didn't think Quirrell was Voldemort and behind both the Hermione plots. The main reason for that was because Dumbledore had a lot of evidence pointing towards him, and I kept on switching back and forth between thinking Dumbledore did one or both of them to Quirrell or some other perp. (What's mentioned in Harry's conversation with Lucius seems to pin it down, as well as some other things throughout the book.)

Then I saw that [Meta Spoiler](#s "EY had confirmed QQ=V in a retracted Author's note, which confused me. I now think it's almost impossible for that not to be true in at least some sense, or for QQ to not be behind both the duel and troll.")

However, all the evidence that points to Dumbledore is still there, and I don't want to blame *all* of that on Quirrell setting things up.

So my hypothesis is that Q and D are in this together, where "this" is some plan involving getting Harry to fulfill both of their wants.

Evidence in favor of this:

1. Dumbledore accepts Q apparently without needing to know who he is
2. Dumbledore doesn't grow suspicious of Q at any point in the year
3. There are pieces of evidence pointing to both D and Q for the same plots
4. Dumbledore let Harry off too easy for the prison breakout
5. Dumbledore plays along with the plot to get Hermione sent to Azkaban

Pieces of evidence against:

1. Dumbledore lost a lot in the war against V, including his brother (perhaps it's not really him/taken over by Horcrux, or brother's death was staged)
2. Dumbledore appears moral (perhaps he still believes in the greater good/ is trying to achieve immortality despite what he told Harry)

I'm willing to bet for this at 10:90% odds (I'll put up 1 to your 9). Any takers or alternate offers?

Edit: archived at https://archive.today/cZlqY for the bets. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Got an email about bitcoin trying to scam me, for your amusement </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-02-04 16:55:15 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> **Disclaimer: this is obviously a scam, so please don't send any money to this person.**

Got this email with the subject line "[ATTENTION SENIORS] If you have $20, this explosive cryptocurrency could change your life"

https://imgur.com/a/F6E7L

So, of course, I immediately clicked on the link, curious which alt coin they were pushing.
The link was to http://pro.wallstreetdaily.com/TAOREWARDSUSPRC/LTAOR209/?h=true, and the long text explanation of what was being sold is at http://pro.wallstreetdaily.com/TAOREWARDSUSPRC/LTAOR209/Full?h=true

Some hilarious excerpts

The value of Bitcoins in circulation has now topped $1.5 billion  more than twice the market cap of Apple.
No wonder major companies like Dell, Amazon, and Target, all accept Bitcoin as payment.

Hahahahahahahaha.

Someone must have done the math too quickly, and thought that Apple's market cap was 700 *million* instead of billion.

And apparently Amazon and Target now accept bitcoins. Wonder if they got that from Gaw? That would also fit with the "get in for under $20" hahahaha.

Before I reveal this opportunity in detail, please allow me to **formerly** introduce myself.

Wait, does that mean you already introduced yourself?

No wonder Americas elite are using it too, including Jerry Seinfeld, Robert DeNiro, and Britney Spears. Its rumored that Denzel Washington used this currency to pay for a $30 million private jet.

Yeah, you can say anything in an article and that will make it have been "rumored". This probably can't be topped.

Even President Obama flashed it to the world while purchasing his lunch.

I take that back.

However, Ive discovered an amazing loophole in Americas rewards-points system.

And you chose to share it with all of us, of course. Wonder what that implies about its viability?

The report reveals the company actively mining Americas top rewards points systems...

Ooh! Mining!

I peg the value of your first opportunity at upwards of $56,700.

... and I'll sell it to you for only $9.99. Aren't I nice?

On page 109 Chris reveals how a morning stop to his local 7-Eleven made him a fortune. Since Chris is an avid Snapple drinker, one day, he noticed the stores shelf spaaaaaace for Snapple products had shrunk from two full refrigerators to less than half of one.
He immediately took action, executing his incredibly simple information arbitrage strategy.
The very next week, Snapple announced that its inventory of unsold products had sharply risen, negatively impacting the companys profits.
Chris tripled his investment in a few days.

... is there anything I could even say to this? My guess is that he is either flat out lying, or invested in hundreds of companies and only reports the profitable ones.

Chris reveals how a friends unassuming Facebook post scored him a quick 50% gainer. The post simply said, Oh my! Chuggington?!!! I think my kids have died and gone to heaven!
Within days of observing the post, Chris perfectly executed his information arbitrage strategy and invested ahead of Chuggington becoming a smash hit among children. 

How can I get him to follow me so I can pump everything I own to this very rich person?

Below are a few of the fantastic letters I received from readers last week...

This is in almost every scam pitch I've ever seen.



Final thoughts: I am really disappointed. If you're going to write a scam pitch, at least make sure all the irrelevant facts in it are true. Also, this is dated from October, so why did I only get an email this week? Someone's slacking off.

(The company referred to is http://investor.points.com/, and obviously Robert Williams owns a large number of shares in it.)


Someone should get the list of Paycoin holders and sell it to this guy.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I know that the code says for coins not to be mined eventually. However, bitcon is likely to be hard forked many times by then, and miners are the ones who decide what happens, so why won't they just decide to continue making coins? They won't have the same commitment to keeping the protocol as us 100 years back, and would do whatever is best for them. Assuming bitcoin is still around then, what factors will affect whether coins stop being mined like scheduled?

The same question goes for every halving. What incentive will miners have to play along? </TEXT>

Does that mean there's a problem with the network? Usually transactions show up on blockchain instantly. It's also been a while and it hasn't been in any blocks on blockr.io. Is this a sign of anything?

	<TITLE> What's up with harry's superstition? (spoilers 38) </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-11-30 20:00:17 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> In the conversation Harry had with Mcgonagall in Diagon Alloy, we learn that he isn't superstitious:

Um Harry said. He took a deep breath. Thered been some muggings in our neighborhood, and my mother asked me to return a pan shed borrowed to a neighbor two streets away, and I said I didnt want to because I might get mugged, and she said, Harry, dont say things like that! Like thinking about it would make it happen, so if I didnt talk about it, I would be safe. I tried to explain why I wasnt reassured, and she made me carry over the pan anyway. I was too young to know how statistically unlikely it was for a mugger to target me, but I was old enough to know that not-thinking about something doesnt stop it from happening, so I was really scared.

So it is surprising that on at least two other occasions, in Chapter 21 and 38, he does things which are blatantly superstitious. 

And Harry was sitting in the cavern level of his trunk, slid shut and locked so no one could get in, a blanket pulled over his head, waiting for the week to be over.
10:01.
10:02.
10:03, but just to be sure
10:04 and the first week was done.
Harry breathed a sigh of relief, and gingerly pulled the blanket off of his head.

and:

He didnt sit at the same nearby table hed sat down at with Draco, the first time hed prepared to board this train. That seemed like tempting history to repeat itself.

I'm *very* wary of suggesting this, but as it happened twice, maybe it's significant? Could someone have messed with his mind enough to change how he thought about fate? We know from the first chapter that magic caused Harry to believe that it existed without proper evidence (or at least that's how I read it, as confirming that intuitions exist in HPMOR). But Harry still hadn't updated by the time of the Diagon Alley talk, for some reason. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Why did Harry need to know how good the explanation was? (Spoilers Chapter 100) </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Harrys own voice said, then, sounding strange in present-Harrys ears, He has a surprisingly good explanation.

Why did Harry say that? Obviously, the direct cause of that statement was that Future!Harry remembered hearing it while he was Present!Harry. However, this doesn't explain the real cause. We know from elsewhere in HPMOR that time seems to do that kind of stuff when there would otherwise be a paradox. So this sentence implies that, had Harry not known of a good explanation coming, something would have happened that would cause him to try to change time. What was that? What would have happened had he not been told that, that was drastic enough to cause Time Itself to twist? Remember, Harry knows Not To Mess With Time, so it would have to be **really really important** for him to try doing something.

(I'd also like to point out that, since he heard the explanation while anticipating a good one, he is automatically subject to confirmation bias, meaning he would notice less if it wasn't good, without any Harry ever deciding it was good by "himself".) </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Why is net neutrality good? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> I've read a little bit about this "net neutrality" thingy and I don't really get why it is a good thing.

As I understand it, we (the protesters) want the FCC or whoever to keep *more* regulations. That's the first red flag. I haven't seen any explanation of why the free market wouldn't work in this case.

Second, if your ISP started slowing down smaller websites, what would you do? Well, what if there was another ISP that wanted your business, and they offered equal speeds for all websites? You know what would happen? Three guesses:

* Everyone switches to ISP #2
* Everyone switches to ISP #2
* Everyone switches to ISP #2

That's called a free market. Do you know why Sprint still offers unlimited data for smartphones after all the other US carriers started limiting the amounts? Because there's a market for it. There are people who would switch away from Sprint to whoever offered a better service.

If all these people who signed, called, emailed, and otherwise joined the campaign, instead signed a petition that they would switch away from any ISP that doesn't give all website the same bandwidth, wouldn't that create significant incentives to ISPs to maintain the status quo? And companies that might pay for faster speeds will get less people to reach with them, so the prices will go down, and the ISP will not be gaining that much, so they'll switch back to neutrality soon.

I'm willing to change my view if someone can explain what I'm missing. I'm trying to understand, and don't get it. So why does the free market fail in this instance, and why is the government needed to step in? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Ravenclaw prefect as a suspect (spoiler 9) </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-08-18 04:19:19 </DATE>

	<TEXT> Well in chapter 9:

Though Harry had been right to consult a Ravenclaw prefect first. The young woman hadn't even looked up from her reading or identified Harry, just jabbed a wand in Neville's direction and muttered something. After which Neville had acquired a dazed expression and wandered off to the fifth carriage from the front and the fourth compartment on the left, which indeed had contained his toad.

So there's a prefect (possibly Penelope Clearwater, possibly not) who knows some mind control methods, hanging around Hogwarts and Harry. I don't think a simple charm could have done that, it seems like it would need Legilimency to get the information and Confundus, Legilimency, or Imperious to get Neville to go there. I don't see any way around the Legilimency requirement, which is "incredibly rare", and thus suspicious. Is there any other method that could have been done with standard magic, or should we be *very* suspicious of unnamed prefect?

(I suppose it could have been done by hiding the toad in a known location beforehand, then sending Neville there with a standard Confundus, but it doesn't seem like she was setting it up, and she wouldn't know that she would be approached [or she could have Confunded Harry and Neville to approach her specifically, but we're getting complexity penalties at this point.]) </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Comed tea and Defence Job link [Spoilers Chap 14] </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-08-13 05:28:35 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I don't know if this theory has been proposed before, but what if

The curse on the Defence job works like the Comed-tea? That is, only wizards who are going to get caught doing a fireable offense during the next year get unexplained urges to work at Hogwarts? That might explain Quirrell's stated reason for working at Hogwarts, if he is not QuirrellMort.

Are there other plausible hypothesis for how the curse works? </TEXT>
