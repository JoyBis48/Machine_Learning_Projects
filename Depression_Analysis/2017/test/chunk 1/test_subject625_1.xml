	<TEXT> That's the thing about it, always hard to meet new people! But hopefully I can connect more with this subreddit. It'd be way cooler to have a meeting of the minds or something and just trip out and share experiences though haha </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes! I'm a heavy gamer too and I have very different tastes when it comes to me and my friends. Gaming and tripping go together like PB   J for me and when nobody else is enjoying it it's like "Ugghhh really?". I completely agree with the 60's culture thing. I think I've gotten a much better understanding of the whole mindset of that culture and it's really great. I might even go as far as saying I'm turning into a little bit of a hippie myself haha Also taking into account that Death Metal is scary for me to listen to when I'm tripping and that's a lot of what I enjoy sober D: </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah that's another reason why I'm really liking this subreddit. Lots of like minded people here, I've seen plenty of titles that look like they've just been extracted from my mind written by trippers. In regard to babysitting them, yeah, old real quick. It's a waste of a trip sometimes and I value that time since I never know when I can experience it again. Solo tripping is fantastic but at the same time I want to tell people my thoughts haha It's a cruel irony, it's the one time I like telling people what I think. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> DUDE, I was heading into the theater with my ex when this came out. I had four tabs in my pocket... This chick... said "No, not in public."

As soon as the opening credits rolled, I was like "Yup, I should be tripping."

That's what you get for being whipped I guess... </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Loner-tripper, conversation is a facade </TITLE>

	<TEXT> So I've always been the type of person to keep to myself. Don't talk (usually) unless spoken to, stay in my room alone, etc. Now don't get me wrong; I have plenty of good friends that I love shooting the shit with and we talk plenty. I guess it's a comfort zone thing but I digress. I've tripped with people on plenty of occasions and I've gotten lost on what to say 70% of the time. Throughout my trips, I began realizing how redundant conversation is. A series of words in a specific sequence to only partly convey your thoughts and feelings... Might be one of those things where I'd have to be tripping to explain it better but that's kinda the gist of it. But not only that, sometimes I'll say the wrong things and just look like an ass. Not like, my words are coming out wrong. I mean I'll say something that might come off as rude or not factual. There is no filter on my mouth. It's annoying cause I have to go on a though loop just to make the right conversation with people. Then, I'm a constant worrier. Not to the point where I'm freaking out. I just want to make sure everyone I'm with is okay and happy. But it's too much, every ten minutes I'm worried someone is gonna go into a bad trip because I said something wrong. Well, my friends all have pretty dark pasts and I have too but, not to toot my own horn, I handle it well. I love dark things usually and I can just talk about things like that when tripping and I'll be fine. But when you factor in the "No filter" thing and worrying about people you can see where it's a problem. Now this is the last piece of this loner puzzle: Nobody I know wants to trip like I do. They want to look at goofy pictures and all that crap. Don't get me wrong, I loooove the visuals. But I'm always the only one reaching for something more than my friends. I want to go on a nature walk and look at the starts and talk about trip theories. I want to watch an in depth movie to get a better understanding of it. I want to dissect everything. Sometimes I even want to chill in silence and just think. That's complete happiness for me. This has all lead me to only being able to trip by myself. Nobody shares my interests, they don't want to enjoy the trippy things that I enjoy. It's a bummer but what are your opinions? Any loners out there? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm sure there's tons of these posts every day so I'm gonna try as hard as possible to get through this smoothly. I'd like to order SHIT, I only have a Windows 7 desktop right now. I was thinking about purchasing a netbook but I'm weighing the costs on that decision. I looked at the start up guide and I've also read things that say it's a little overkill in terms of safety. I'm ready to learn so if anyone can guide me it'd be extremely appreciated!

	<TEXT> Always a bummer when some dealer gives you bunk tabs. Had this happen to me the other day. I look very forward to my trips, so getting let down is just blegh. What do you guys do instead when you get beat for tabs? </TEXT>
