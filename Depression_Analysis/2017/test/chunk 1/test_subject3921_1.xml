	<TITLE> My mom has a new black boyfriend... </TITLE>

	<TEXT> My parents are divorced and are still friends, my mom recently started dating a black man (my family is all whites), my dad was over looking for a key to a car. Keep in mind my dad has NEVER made a vulgar joke around me. While talking about the key to the car she says,
"Yeah, it's big and black."

and so my dad says,

"Yeah, that's two things that are big and black." You can clearly see how butthurt my mom is.

Five minutes later he comes up to me and says "Daddy's clever, right?" and high fived me. I've never laughed so hard.  </TEXT>
