	<TEXT> No offense but I'm sure the people who are working on this are a tad bit more knowledgeable than you.  Yeah, obviously there are hurtles, if there weren't any it would be imminent and not 10 years down the road (projected). You people always pop up, "well... established knowledge dictates that this is impossible, therefore any advancement is not possible." Or maybe you're not one of those.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I really don't enjoy riding a bike in Houston. It's fine in neighborhoods and less busy side streets but I just feel extremely vulnerable on a bike with cars (driven by Houstonians) approaching from my blind spot (see: I don't have eyes in the back of my head). I walk anywhere 2 miles or less (walking is under valued in today's society) and taxi anything between 2 and 5 miles, which covers most of my territory.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I fucking love the light rail. Instead of driving to work, I started commuting via bus and rail. Takes a bit longer (30 mins in morning up from 15-20, 45 in the afternoon up from 30) but god damn are my stress levels way way down. I don't call grandma a cunt for driving too slow or get stressed out when I miss a light. It seriously has improved my life in many ways. I'd recommend it for anyone who can, and hope that with the current surge of centralized population growth, the demand and need will be in place for valuable expansion.

Having a car is nice, not relying on a car is much nicer.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My mum was convinced I *would* get raped *just because I moved to NYC*. Not for going out and partying every night, but for living in a city.

While I agree that is valid for a parent to worry about their child's safety, I think it's outlandish to be convinced that you would get raped just because you moved to NYC. That's pretty outlandish, no? Just as a numbers game, the rate of rape per 100,000 people in NYC is 14, while the rate of rape per 100,000 in the US as a whole is almost twice that at 26.9. As far as cities go, NYC is one of the (if not the?) safest, at least in the US. So while it might be *less safe* than where you originate (I'm picturing the town from Hot Fuzz), it's not like you're living in Cairo or Mumbai. If that were the case, I don't think it would be quite so outlandish.

So yeah, we agree, moms worry, it's not wrong for them to worry, I just think the comment I quoted was outlandish.

People worry about a lot of outlandish things, it doesn't mean they're wrong, it just means they worry about unlikely scenarios which they have no control over.

Good point! Wow, such generalized insight!

That's pretty much the whole point of a bar. Though it is possible to go to one *and not get smashed*, *the odds of that are pretty slim*. 

Smells like you have an alcohol problem.

I think it's irresponsible for you to assume that someone with a fairly obvious grasp of the English language doesn't know what a basic word like irresponsible means. </TEXT>
