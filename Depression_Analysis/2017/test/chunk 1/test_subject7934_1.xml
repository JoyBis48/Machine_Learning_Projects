How it works: You follow people and places, and they leave messages for you around the city. When you walk near one, you get an alert on your phone. Its like Twitter for your map, with, uh, alerts. Make sense?

Follow lots of people   places (so you can experience the alerts feature), then walk around the city. Weve got a couple of foodies in there, so try following them, or places like Great American Music Hall, Castro Theater, etc, which produce great alerts.
Were really curious to hear feedback. Thanks! </TEXT>

What would have happened had a camera not fortuitously captured the truth?  Very possibly a completely innocent guy might have not only gone to jail (as he did), but also ended up with a record of assault - against a police officer.  Add to this that they regularly plant drugs to meet quotas.  Yet, in the absence of direct evidence, our judicial system treats their word as incontrovertible.  What will it take to change the presumption that  police are truthful? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Here is the interview with Colbert, if you haven't seen it already: http://gawker.com/5855105/stephen-colbert-trolls-occupy-wall-street "I'm a female-bodied person" and other choice quotes in this video.

OWS needs to stay on message and not veer off into weird gender issue language like this girl did.  This is exactly what killed the Left in the 80s.  Let's keep it practical and focused on the economic issues.

**EDIT**: Someone asked "WTF does killed  the left in the 80s refer to?"  

That was the era of Political Correctness - a term they themselves used. I was at Brown at the time. I became disgusted when some of these activists started posting signs on men's bathrooms informing them that "rape is not sex". I'm a guy and used to refer to myself as a feminist. They lost me at that moment. And then minority groups (I am one) started whining about their "subaltern identities". It was absurd, self-absorbed, divisive and just completely repellent to people who weren't crazed ideologues. Rush Limbaugh rose to fame complaining about this stuff. The rest is history. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Our site, started as a way for Redditors to find each other in the real world - is Launching at Maker Faire tomorrow. Redditors, come join us. Tag yourself with #reddit, and we can meetup at the Faire.

	<TEXT> About six months ago we tried a little pilot [to help Redditors find each other nearby](http://www.reddit.com/r/ScavengerSpies/comments/e25xo/built_a_website_to_help_redditors_find_each_other/ )(*).  You tag yourself (with [#reddit](http://blipboard.com/tag/reddit)), check-in to places when you visit, and get matched with redditors.   

If you don't know [what Maker Faire is](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dsZY018jOY), you should - it's super fun.   Here's a [map](https://s3.amazonaws.com/blipboard/viewable/maker/MF11_Map_Info_v5-GENERAL-PUBLIC.pdf) (we're the official app of the event!).  It's held at the San Mateo Fairgrounds.

Here's **how to sign up @ Maker Faire**:  [maker.blipboard.com](http://maker.blipboard.com)  Write a short message and add tags.  Be sure to include #reddit in your message.


We're going to get together afterwards on Sunday.  I would be totally *honored* if some Redditors showed up to join us.

* * *
(*)Here's [a map of Redditors around the world](http://blipboard.com/tag/reddit/map ).  

(**) There's a mobile version of the site (just visit maker.blipboard.com on your phone), and a very beta [native version in the App store](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/blipboard/id428023608?mt=8). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've been a Redditor for almost 4 years, and have been amazed by how folks here were noticing each other in public, and getting together in real life.  I always thought it would be cool if we could secretly signal to each other.  This [website](http://blipboard.com) is pretty much the result.  It's been our dream to get redditors using it. 

It's mainly the work of 2 people, and we'd *love* to get your feedback.  

http://blipboard.com
Invite code: SCAVENGERSPIES [CLOSED: Please private message me if you'd like an invite code]

**EDIT**: Note: IE is not working yet

**EDIT 2**: Thanks so much for the encouragement and feedback.  You're the first people outside of friends and family to use the site, so matches are going to be pretty thin right now, but keep trying.  There are definitely matches to be had in San Francisco, if you want to "fake it" - or, get a friend to check-in at or near the same location with the same tags.

**EDIT 3**: Could people who sign up post their cities here?  

**EDIT 4**: Started [/r/blipboard](http://reddit.com/r/blipboard) as a place to post bugs   vote on features.

**EDIT 5**: A [map](http://blipboard.com/redditors) of where we're checking-in </TEXT>
