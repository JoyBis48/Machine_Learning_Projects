	<TEXT> Depends on what you want to do. For night life, the Gas Lamp, Pacific Beach and North Park are the main spots. The Gas Lamp is even cool during the day and it's within walking distance of PetCo. At night, it's a little showy, but a lot of fun. The trolley runs there, but it stops around 11:30. Pacific Beach is great at night too. It attracts a younger crowd, a lot of bros and hoes. Cabo Cantina will have more 21 year old girls than you'll ever see again in your life. You have to drive there though. North Park is the most laid back spot. It has a super hipster vibe. If you go here, be sure to check out Seven Grand and True North Tavern. 


During the day, I recommend visiting a brewery. San Diego has Stone, Green Flash, Mission, Ballast Point and a few others that I can't think of. I recommend Mission. Their Shipwreck IIPA is one of my favorite beers ever. Plus, you can take the trolley to 12th   Imperial, walk there and then either walk or trolley to the game.  </TEXT>

I don't necessarily disagree with that, but I'm surprised to hear the president write the regime off as a potential ally against ISIS.

Assad is in control of an entire air force, and what seems to be a more organized military than the rebels. I would not have been shocked to see the US reluctantly side with Assad in exchange for his assistance in going after ISIS. The language the President used tonight rules that possibility out.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I know, I know I hate posts here where OP makes excuses too.

I'm staying at my parents' house for a few months. My dad has a bench. So, I can do bench, DLs, rows. He also has dumbbells and a pullup bar, so I can do dumbbell press and pullups. Everything I need to build a strong upper body is there. The problem is, he doesn't have a way to safely squat. The only thing he has for lower body is a leg extension/leg curl machine attached to the bench. 

What kind of results can I expect to my lower body if I combine that with dumbbel lunges? Are there any other lower body exercises I can do with the equipment I have?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm constantly wondering how I'm going to get my next meal. I wake up in the morning and I try to remember how much food is in the house. How much milk do I have and is it enough to make it through the day? When will I find time to go to the store today to get more milk for tomorrow? Did I remember to wash my blender last night? Is today lifting day? I think about how many calories I need to have consumed by the time I leave for work, because I know I will be too tired to cook a big meal when I come home. I don't want to be hungry at work, but I also don't want protein farts. I lay in bed browsing reddit on my phone, but I know I should be eating.

If I start to feel hungry at work, I fret over the gains I'm losing. I count the minutes until I can take my break and find some food. But I only have 15 minutes. I run to Starbucks and hope they have breakfast sandwiches left. That will have to hold me over for the rest of my shift. 


I come home feeling tired, but I can't go to bed until I hit my caloric goal. I debate whether I have the energy to cook a full meal or if I should just piece away at some milk and snacks for a bit. I choose the latter. I hit my goal for the day, but at what cost? I now have almost nothing left for the following day. If today was a struggle, tomorrow will only be harder. I look at my shirtless body in the mirror as I brush my teeth. I'm tired and bloated, but goddammit if I don't look bigger. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Objectified for my swole at my own place of employment. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-01-08 22:50:23 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Brothers and sisters in swole, like many of you, I didn't think it could happen to me. I read your stories of swolestation and felt the same rage you felt, but I thought I was safe. Surely those around me appreciate me for my personality, I believed. Yet, yesterday, at my own place of employment no less, I was used like some piece of farm equipment.

I'm relatively new to the Iron Path, but Brodin has been very good to me. I've noticed the stealthy glances of passersby as they 'mire my aesthetics, but I can take that because I also consider myself swole of spirit. But what happened yesterday was more than I can bare.

My work has conducted a food drive over the last two months to collect food for the less fortunate. I was extra motivated, as I saw this as an opportunity to give the aspiring followers of Brodin the fuel they need to make mad gains. Our store was very successful in our efforts and yesterday, we finally delivered the boxes of food to the food closet on the other side of town. There were dozens of boxes, many filled with canned goods. 

Without warning or asking me if I wanted to help, my boss informed me yesterday that she "needed my muscles" to help her deliver the food. I was dumbfounded. I've always tried to be the best employee I could be, but suddenly I found myself as nothing more than a tool to help move nonperishable food items. I have never felt so objectified. 

I sat in silence next to my boss on the car ride over as I tried my best to contain my tears. When we finally arrived, I did my best to deliver the boxes as quickly as possible so I could return to work and have a good think in the break room. As soon as the last box was set down, the food closet manager said perkily, "We sure are lucky to have you. Otherwise we would have been moving boxes all afternoon." Do you believe the nerve? She didn't even consider the possibility that the previous day was deadlift day and maybe lifting heavy boxes off the ground wasn't ideal for me. 

I'm at a loss, reddit. I thought my place of employment was my sanctuary. What should I do? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not the most devout worshipper of Brodin, but I have paid my dues at the Iron Temple regularly this year, and have been blessed with righteous gains. I've been swolested on a couple of occasions, but I forgive those people, for they know not the error of their ways. The pain that their actions caused me was erased after an experience yesterday at work.


An unruly customer, neither swole of body or mind, threatened my boss after she banned him from the store. This was the third time she has had to ask him to leave and each time he has made a scene while exiting. Unfortunately, I was not present to witness the events as they happened that day, but they worried my boss. As the day went on and she resumed normal work activity, she needed to go to her car to get something. Although I was the youngest man working that day, it was me she asked to walk with her for protection. Brodin gave me this opportunity to use my gains for good. I escorted her to and from her car without incident. Although my presence was unnecessary, it felt good to be asked to provide protection. </TEXT>
