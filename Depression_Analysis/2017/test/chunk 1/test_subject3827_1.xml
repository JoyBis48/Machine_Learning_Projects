	<TITLE> Why The Dark Knight Doesn't Deserve To Have 9/10 On IMDb </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-04-27 02:35:30 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Now don't get me wrong. The Dark Knight is not, by any means, a bad movie. It is well acted, well directed, and very well put together. But as a superhero movie, and as a movie in general, it falls down in a few places.

1 We don't get emotionally involved with our characters. In movies like Superman or Spider-Man, our characters show that they are humans, and they have struggles. Superman literally moves the world back in time to save the person he loves. Spider-Man never knows whether he should reveal his true self to his friends and enemies. Batman just says he's the good guy. He doesn't show it, and you probably wouldn't care if he died.

2 Why so much violence? Seriously, why does every car or building need to get shot at or blown up? It should be a battle between the hero and the villain, not the hero and the villain and the rest of the world. It doesn't need to happen, and it shouldn't. Maybe a few times, but it shouldn't detract from the story itself.

TL,DR: - this is NOT a bad movie, but there are much better superhero films

	<TITLE> Could The Godfather Part IV have worked? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-04-24 23:59:37 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Sometime before or after the release of The Godfather Part III, Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola came up with a potential sequel idea. It would have been a similar style to Part II, switching back and forth from Vito's early days as Don in the 1930s (as well as the early years of his children's lives), and Vincent as the new Don in the 1980s. Vincent takes a turn from his predecessors, and gets the Corleone family involved with narcotics again. It would have ended with his death. 

More info can be found [here](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincent_Corleone), under "abandoned sequel"

Do you think this could've worked? </TEXT>

Some examples:

Thought that Star Wars was "too slow," Back to the Future is "cheesy" and Hitchcock is boring.

I need a 20th century movie that quickly gets into the plot, looks good, has a good pace, and good acting. His favorite movies are The Social Network and Nightcrawler.

	<TITLE> What I Think Would Be The Highest Grossing Movie Of All Time </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-03-24 19:58:31 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> An idea I had for the highest grossing movie of all time:

Director: Christopher Nolan 

Producer: James Cameron

Writers: Joss Whedon +                      
              Quentin Tarantino

Starring: Leonardo Di Caprio, Christian 
               Bale, Jennifer Lawrence, 
               Scarlett Johansson

Music: Hans Zimmer

Cinematography: Emmanuel Lubezki

Visual Effects: Weta Digital


What would you pick? Anything to add or change? 

EDIT: Spielberg as co director, also with Chris Pratt

EDIT 2: The plot is a cross between Interstellar, Inception, and Guardians of the Galaxy. Obviously. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> What would you say to a Super Smash Bros. racing game? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-01-28 03:20:46 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Super Smash Brothers Drift (Kart Racing/Fighting game)

You would be able to play as all the characters from the most recent SSB game, with their own customizable racing karts.

The style of the game would be somewhat different than other racers like Mario Kart - you can choose to compete with 4 - 12 players on a variety of tracks. 

But here's the twist - there's no finish line - you are continually moving around the chosen track. The position of the players is determined by a damage meter/percentage, like that of the real SSB games. You can use a multitude of attacks on other players, including bumping into other karts, and launching projectiles. Items and power ups would be scattered around the track, and whomever has the least damage when the time limit is up wins the game.

This is just an idea I had and I would love to here your opinions. I'm working on some concept art for the game, which I'll post later. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Theory About Console Names </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-01-12 22:29:03 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> This is kind of a stupid theory, but I'll share it anyway:

As we all know, Nintendo's first few consoles were the NES, SNES, N64, and the Gamecube. Then, we had the Wii, followed by the Wii U. 

See any similarities yet? Well, it's a bit of a stretch, but both the NES and the Wii were succeeded by consoles that had the same name, with an extra letter added. This could be totally insignificant, but could the next console be the Nintendo 128 (or something along those lines) followed by the Nintendo Videosphere? Only time will tell...


TL;DR - theory about console naming
