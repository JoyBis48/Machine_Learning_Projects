	<TEXT> I wrote a paper on zebra stripes for my intro evolution course last year.  It was difficult to find studies on zebra stripes because everyone has just gone with the explanation someone came up with in ~~1890~~ 1867.

EDIT: Looked up the date - it was 1867, not 1890. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Why have ecologists moved away from using Optimal Foraging Theory to explain feeding behavior in animals? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> I'm an undergrad and do research in an ecology lab on my university's campus.  In my ecology courses, I learned about Optimal Foraging Theory (OFT) and even did some small experiments in those courses pertaining to OFT.  In my lab the other day, some of the professors were talking during our weekly lab meeting about behavior and one said that ecologists haven't used OFT to explain behavior in decades, ehoch surprised me since most of my courses devote so much time on the topic.  The professors in my lab are always busy and are out of the lab half the time, so I figured I'd ask other ecologically inclined people here!

Are there major flaws that make OFT a bad explanation for behavior?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Here are a [couple](http://www.care2.com/causes/wind-farms-and-eagle-deaths-the-dilemmas-of-green-energy.html) of [articles](http://bigstory.ap.org/article/ap-impact-wind-farms-get-pass-eagle-deaths) about what /u/DonnieS1 is talking about.

I know that wind farms kill far fewer birds than other forms of energy production, but they should be held accountable if they commit the same federal offenses as the other guys.  If they aren't made to pay the fines though, I'd like to see wind farms that kill birds put money towards conservation of affected bird species (if they don't already do that). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I just got a friend request about 20 minutes ago from someone I didn't know, but whose name I had seen before but couldn't remember where. When I read your comment,  it dawned on me, and sure enough, this person's name appeared on my phone's caller ID when he tried to call me last week (I don't answer for names I don't recognize). That's really unnerving... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> These headphones definitely make the vast majority of the songs I listen to sound glorious, but I've never listened to any other headphones so I can't say whether or not they're the best out there.  I would recommend them based on my experience and general stinginess though, at least until (or if) I come across another kind that I think sound better and are in the same price range. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I got myself the Audio Technica ATH-M50 a few months ago for about $100.  This is my first non-earbud listening apparatus and I'd definitely recommend it for anyone looking for a decent pair of headphones at a fair price, especially since I've spent $150 for Bose earbuds before. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Last year, as I was walking down a campus street in the afternoon, a middle-aged couple approached me.  The man began to tell me this story about how his lady has been in the university hospital, so they needed money because their car was parked in the hospital garage and was also out of gas and they haven't eaten all day and needed food.  The lady even showed me a "hospital ID bracelet" she was wearing to prove she had just left the hospital.  I knew this story was BS, because they were in the academic core of the university which is about 10 blocks from the hospital and they both looked homeless.  I told them I was a broke college student, but they wouldn't take that for an answer.  The man kept adding to his story and was getting closer to me and the woman started to move to my side and was heading behind me.  Since there were 2 of them and 1 of me and the street was unusually deserted at the time, I gave them the change in my pocket and they immediately left.  I figured it was better to give them ~$1 in change and get out of there than to stay and potentially get robbed. </TEXT>
