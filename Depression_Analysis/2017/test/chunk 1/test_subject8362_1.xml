	<TEXT> A few years back, my friend and I were walking through Target and they had some of these up. She literally got super pissed off that they would make something so dumb and useless and thought they were for cats or some other small animal. I had to explain that they were for display purpose only and not for actual use. She felt pretty dumb. It was awesome. I make fun of her any time we come across anything miniature. To her credit, she was a super stoner back then.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> OP must not have kids. I would rather wait an extra 10 minutes in the car than get all of my kids out of the car and have to corral them while in the restaurant. Drive through ANYTHING is a lifesaver when there are small children in the car.  </TEXT>
