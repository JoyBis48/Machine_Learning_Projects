	<TEXT> If he's gaming, he won't see the 30$ difference in the 6000 series.  It performs about 3% better in games than the 4300.  Also,  in response to not witty, the gtx 760 is nearly equivalent to a gtx 670. Your CPU is probably bottle necking your 760 slightly, but it's nothing that would be noticeable and I wouldn't go buy a new CPU over it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Pcpartpicker.com is probably the site.

My general rule is:
CPU: if your using a gtx 760 or above go intel (4670k or 4770k are great CPUs)

If you go with a budget CPU anything up to a 660ti, go with the amd phnom ii x4 965 be or fx 4000 series.

Gpu:  if you are going to do 3 1080p monitors or go with one 1440p monitors, go with 2 gtx 760s in sli. If you are using one 1080p monitor, something from amd should suffice.

The gtx 760 has the best price/performance ratio at the moment and you can sli 3 of them. They also have a very high frame buffer so you won't notice microstuttering much. 2 gtx 760's in sli perform better than a gtx Titan for 500$ less.

Storage: Samsung 840 pro series for ssd.  Western digital caviar black for hdd.  I personally go for raid 0 hard drives over one ssd, so I have storage (2tb vs 128gb-256gb) and some speed to go along with it. 

Monitors: yamakasi cat leap. Find it on eBay, best value for a 120hz monitor.

If you need more help, go to the forums on pcpartpicker and go to partlistopinions wanted. I'm a regular on that sub forum and a lot of other people would be glad to help you :)! </TEXT>
