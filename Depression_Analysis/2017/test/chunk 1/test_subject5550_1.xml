Some dick broke into my blue Corolla at a parking lot around this area. There was almost nothing of value in the car, but we'd left house keys in it so those got jacked. Front passenger window is missing also.

It occurred between 3:30 AM and 4:30 AM on 5/17 (probably closer to 3:30 since alarm wasn't blarin when I got to it). So any info from about that time if you were in the area could be helpful.

I'm going to hit the businesses up that operate around there tomorrow as well. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Can we get automod functionality to simply block off posts until accounts have accrued some age. When I look over a page of the sub these days, a disproportionate number of the requests now come from new throwaways, people who aren't even redditors.

When Kirk [put this sub together](http://www.reddit.com/r/Loans/comments/jm1os/meta_about_the_creation_of_this_subreddit/), the purpose was to **help redditors**. It's quickly devolving into a haven for scammers. My concern isn't just that a bunch of new lenders aren't intelligent enough to read over the side bar - that's always existed, but w/ all the spam (that's effectively what it is) from accounts made within the last day or two, it becomes tedious to even find posts by **actual redditors**

Other subs where goods/capital are exchanged have used automod functionality for a long time to restrict based on objective qualifiers (karma, age, etc.).  And where this may not have been needed in the past, you don't need to look far to see how this sub's devolving.

	<TITLE> [META] A Guide on Verifying Borrower Information </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-05-13 12:35:26 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> ###Introduction

If you're thinking about lending, start here:

[/r/Loans Wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/Loans/wiki/index)

The META posts in particular provide great information. Not all of the information there is entirely current though. This sub has grown a lot since those guides were written and scammers have become a lot more interested in the sub - meaning the average lender shouldn't assume good-will as easily on the part of the borrower.

In the course of lending, I've come up with my own verification strategies and copied some discussed in META tags here by others. I've attempted to consolidate everything having to do with verifying information into a single thread to make it easy to reference.
 
 
 
 
###Social Media Verification

If they don't have social media, particularly Facebook, or they do and it's basically never been used, has barely any friends or has a ton of spam-account friends, or seems to have been made overnight, that's a red flag. Facebook is the primary extrinsic way for you to truly verify that they are the person whose photo ID they sent you. Go through the Facebook, make sure it's a couple of years old and the images match the photo ID believably. Have them friend you for the duration of the loan and also have them send you a message. It's vital that they add you themselves, or at least send you a message, since there are people who will add anyone.


###Personal Image Verification

When you ask for images (proof of employment, drivers license, and so forth) ask for all of the following:

(1) Photo ID Close-up

(2) Proof of Employment Document

(3) Borrower holding photo ID

(4) Borrower holding a notecard w/ their Reddit username and date

(5) Borrower making a unique physical gesture

You obviously need to make sure the photo ID matches the name they're claiming and that the person in the photo ID has an uncanny resemblance to the person holding the ID.

An image of the individual holding a notecard or something to that effect with their username and the date (4) can be combined with also ask the user to make a unique hand gesture or to hold the card in a unique way *that only you* ask *your* borrowers. Having the individual hold a card w/ the date and username provides a physical watermark. This is entirely fool-proof however, as a reused image w/ a notecard can be easily photoshopped. A hand-gesture is much harder to photoshop and if the image clearly shows their arm fully connected to their body and what-have-you, it only gets tougher.

One real concern that's materialized itself is that scammers are able to use images nefariously gathered. By including a hand-gesture that other borrowers and lenders are unaware of, you make it difficult for a would-be scammer to simply pass off an acquired image as one taken at that moment. This is beneficial not just to you, but also to the community. If somebody receives an image from a potential borrower where the borrower is making a gesture that seems strange or of which they didn't even ask, they'll be inclined to inquire about it.


###PayPal Verification

This has been brought up time and time again. Anybody can make a PayPal account, but by ensuring that you only lend to PayPal verified users, you can rest somewhat assured that PayPal has taken measures to verify their PayPal identity. A 10 year old PayPal Verified account is a lot more likely to be the person they're claiming to be than a one month old unverified account.

The process of ensuring PayPal verification is simple enough. Take the PayPal email address they've provided you and replace the portion with brackets ([email]) in the following URL:

https://www.paypal.com/verified/pal=[email]


###Phone Verification

(1) Once you've gotten their phone number, **have them leave you a voicemail**. If they don't use the phone number they provided you to begin with - that's a big red flag. They provided you with a bad initial phone number for a reason.

(2) Next, check the phone number they've provided you against the following site (or an alternative carrier lookup):

[Free Carrier Lookup](http://www.freecarrierlookup.com/)

Again, if it comes back as a strange carrier or VOIP number, that's another red flag. They're not providing you their physical/regular phone number for a reason.


###Work Verification

Ask them where they work. Google their workplace, give them a call - ask them if they'd be comfortable with that before you do, if you prefer. It will save you a lot of heartache. I've had a borrower tell me they worked at a particular department store - even sending me paystubs. Their work story seemed strange since their Facebook was indicating a lot of free time. So I decided I'd give them a call at their work place. I came up with a quick story in case anybody asked why I was calling them at work, but I found out it was all for naught. They'd been fired a week ago, their bi-monthly paystub that I would normally take as proof that they're capable of repayment was meaningless.


###Conclusion

A thorough verification process may mean that you're spending a few extra minutes making sure the information provided to you was legit. If you truly want to help people on this sub, take the necessary steps to ensure you're not just throwing your money into a black-hole. There are two types of people who default, people down on their luck and scammers. There will always be people down on their luck no matter how many verification steps you take. But we can work towards cleaning this place up of scammers - and the only way to do that is to *stop giving them money* even if it's "just a small amount." Best of luck!

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Does somebody know if there are any established equations or models to predict how snow acts as it plummets towards the Earth? From my understanding, all rain starts off as snow/ice and becomes rain as it falls. My question is what role the mass of the snow/ice, and/or even where it originates in the sky, plays in it's disintegration as it plummets?

Any academic papers on the topic would be interesting as well - academic paywall will not be a problem.

Thank you guys! </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> He didn't have any Reddit creddit to back him up but I reached out to him knowing I'd probably deny the amount. Anyways, he reached back and thoroughly demonstrated that he was indeed a real person in a respectable position- etc.

Anyways, he issued a refund for the full amount - so I though great, I've been repaid. The amount however did not clear with the bank and since than he completely ceased communication and he decided to block me on Facebook. Unfortunately for him, I have a list of every single friend and family member he's listed - I've already reached out to several people close to him and plan to be a lot more exhaustive.

Krishan, save us both the trouble and pay me back. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey guys,

I wanted to see if somebody could throw together a bot that crawls new posts on /r/loans, checks the username of the poster against a list of known scammer usernames, and simply posts a message warning the community in the thread. You'd be doing a huge favor to the community that's helped out several people in their time of need. I would also be happy to donate $20 to you or a charity of your choice. It won't stop scams but it'll put a glaring warning message to deal w/ a currently widespread issue. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Startup Idea - InsuredCoin </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-11-19 19:50:34 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Alright, so here's what I've got:

http://www.insuredcoin.com/

This is my first tech-related venture and I was wondering if I could get input from some of the vets.

I adopted BitCoin early on and used it (mostly for digital goods). After the insane speculation that's recently hit it, I'm really just holding nowadays. But I do believe BTC has a future where it's primary purpose will return to being a cyber-currency that people use for more than CE.

Anyways, one of the major problems with using BTC has been a lack of protection for your BTC. You don't know how your BTC are being handled by the other party, there are no third party audits or an en-forcible security standard. When companies go under (i.e. Silk Road, GBSE) or when their assets are frozen (MtGox), many people end up losing BTC they left with the host. Likewise, everybody knows about some of the major thefts/scams as well as the purely stupid executive failures.

The idea here is to have a pool of BTC that is used to (a) ensure that businesses that get on board adhere to particular security standards and (b) insure BTC used in transactions with said companies. I don't know if this falls under your typical startup since I want to move in the 501 (3) (c) direction once I can afford modest legal fees (or find a pro-bono lawyer). But that's the gist of it (more details on the site itself - the idea isn't 100% fleshed out yet).

Any help with finding some direction, resources or simple critique much appreciated. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I originally posted this as a [PAID] post but I modified it out of principle since it really isn't fully paid (insignificant as the defaulted amount may be).

Repayment was a bit late and communication was okay. I told the person to forego the interest in lieu of complete repayment of the principle. He was apologetic and has gotten ~97% of the principle back to me a month ago. 3.5% was not returned. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Amount was broken into two repayment dates. Missed 1st due date, missed second due date (to which first payment was rescheduled), missed another rescheduled due date and then completely broke contact. She made it clear that she paid rent with the money she was supposed to give to me the first - had plenty of money for celebrations and what-not but somehow couldn't afford to not steal from me. Not a dime sent in good faith at any point. Not communicative (I needed to proactively chase her down ea time).

The worst part was, I knew exactly how this would go down the same day I sent her the amount. Hours after sending the amount, somebody hit me up that this person approached them for an additional loan AFTER I granted mine, telling them I didnt give them the full amount they asked for (a lie). My spidey sense was going off, but it was too late. The other lender lucked out by not lending to this person.

I got my principle back at least (not from her of course) so that's always good. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Crowd-Funding Using BitCoins? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-10-31 06:34:20 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I just went through some of the various crowd-funding platforms using BitCoins - there's a ton within the first 3 results pages. But all the links I clicked seem pretty inactive (my point of comparison is KickStarter and IndieGoGo). Has that movement just not caught on as well in the BTC community?

Basically, I'm just wondering what the one or two successful platforms of this nature are - particularly if I am looking to deliver a physical good.

Within the next month, we're plan on launching our company which will sell the physical product for USD but also through BTC. Is there some online registries you guys can point me to as well where I can let people know, y'know, "WE TAKE BTC!!!". </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2013-10-27 03:54:09 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> This guy was a real character.

- Day 1 We speak. He ups the amount by a 100. I say sure. Interest: 0%
- Day 2 Loan sent
- Day 16 I reach out about 1st payment, he doesn't provide ETA for a reschedule.
- Day 27 Retry. This would've been his final payment date. Provides sob story. Again, I ask for a date. Radio silence
- Day 28 Retry, he replies sometime this week. I demand a date. Suggest 100 of 400 by 9/28. He agrees finally. He corrects to 10/5.
- Day 33 He says he'll be sending 100 eventually. I tell him that won't work so he says he'll be taking a bank loan and pay me back. I suggest 10/7.
- Day 40 I reach out again. I give him an additional 20 days, to which I get (another sob story) "gimme a break". 
- Day 42 I'm done. 

This was a NO INTEREST loan, a 100% favor that put me out 400 for a couple months. And he's asking me to give him a "break" for not paying over 2 months on a NO INTEREST favor. He posted in /r/trees and his background should've given me an idea, but it was one of my first loans and I didn't realize what d-bags some of these borrowers can be to people lending them a helping hand. 

Lesson learned: Once somebody misses the first payment on a partial payment of a large sum  I will contact every single person on their FB from now on. I kept giving the guy the benefit of the doubt since he kept promising payment and I didnt want him to look like a piece of shit with his family/friends, but going forward, thats just not feasible.

On the plus side, I took away so much from this tedious experience that's helped me in more than facet of life to make it worth it.

	<TEXT> I contacted the borrower on the due date. Something unexpected had come up and we rescheduled a few days out. He was apologetic and offered much more interest to compensate and paid it out even though I declined it. He paid more than a fair amount on the rescheduled date. Great borrower, would def lend again. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Only paid after extensive collection efforts - several weeks late (with additional interest though). Was unresponsive until the very end when I was ready to open a claim. Supposedly changed phones but I saw him online on Facebook, in addition to reaching out by email, where he ignored me as well. Worst thing was, I stuck my neck out for the guy and even passed his resume around up here. I made sure nobody I contacted on his behalf escalates his resume further the moment he was late on our rescheduled payment. It's one thing to fall on hard times and get in touch - it's another to dick around w/ someone else's cash until you're left with no options.

I lucked out since apparently he had used a friend's account and that friend was not too happy about facing the consequences of this guy's actions. The interest made up for the extensive collection, but I doubt he would've paid if it wasn't his friend's account on the line. Definitely would not lend again. </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2013-09-20 20:52:34 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> http://www.reddit.com/r/Loans/comments/1lc0c4/req_200_for_utilities_about_to_be_shut_off_im/

Full amount due 9/27. Missed due date for partial on 9/13 but reached out to me which you would think is a positive. But no. He did not give me an expected date either when he let me know he couldn't make payment. I proceeded to contact him a few days later via all mediums and have not heard back. I can see him online and responding to his friends on Facebook - and he still hasn't blocked me so maybe I will see my money.

I can understand if someone hits hard times, but it's not chill to not communicate when that happens. It's been a week now. If you're reading this /u/DustinCasler, you know what happens next. It's my first default but it still feels sucky, I could've helped somebody who wouldn't be a douche but now my money's tied up for at least a month. :(

Edit: Recouped thru alternate sources. Finally had a chat with a guy after posting this and looks like he was just embarrassed about the whole thing. Advice to other borrowers: You need to communicate, even if you can't pay back, so we (lenders) can decide our next move. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> This might be a new problem for loans. I saw somebody on Craigslist buying reddit accounts and thought to myself, "why the hell would you pay for an account on reddit?" I'd be willing to pay a few cents for an account, with several thousand, I could upvote anything I wanted to front page status. But $10-$30 per account? That's weird. And than I stumbled on this section. It'll probably be an easy giveaway when a scammer of that variety pops up (100s of posts a few years ago, lul in activity, 10-20 one word posts presently) but I thought I'd put that out there. </TEXT>
