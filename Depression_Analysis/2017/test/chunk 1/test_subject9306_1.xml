	<TEXT> I think you're a) onto a winner of a girl and b) going to need to take it slow. She's been hurt badly before, wants to trust you, but can't - YET. Also, I know from personal experience that depression will only magnify this, and she will perceive all of these problems as being her fault. All you can do is not pressure her but continue to be loving and caring, and she will do the rest in time. 

To use a convenient metaphor from your own story, you need to slowly lead her into the water and carefully help her relearn to swim, despite her fear and apprehension.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I hate to break it to you, bro, but that kind of attitude is exactly what women (or anyone) finds LEAST attractive. Comparatively, no one gives a fuck if you're ugly/hot smart/dumb so on and so forth, and they'll put up with a bit of self depreciation and lack of self esteem, but when you've let it turn into (what comes across as) bitterness and anger at everything around you that you perceive as better than you, NO ONE will want to spend time with you in any capacity. You have to force yourself to believe in yourself - not even that you're the best or the most outstanding at something, but at least that you're AS GOOD AS EVERYBODY ELSE.

For example, you mentioned that there's a chick who swam across Lake Ontario. So you're not capable of doing that. Well, neither am I. Neither are 6.9 BILLION of the other people in the world. Neither is the guy above me who is a QUALIFIED OLYMPIC SWIMMER. But I can guarantee you're better at swimming across that lake than 1 billion (yes, one billion) people in the world. Chances are you're still better than 3 billion people.

The other thing you need to remind yourself is that depression and low self-esteem is the easy way out. By telling yourself that you suck and that you can't even try, you ARE worse than everybody else at the one thing we all compete in - LIFE. Life itself. It's a race to the finish line, and you're walking dejectedly in the opposite direction. By turning that around and bring determined to win life, you are instantly superior to everybody in the skill that matters more than anything. 

And it'll make you sexy. 

Source: low self esteem, clinical depression, and discovering the hard way that - despite how hard my friends try, and despite anything that anyone ever does - the only person who will get change any of that is ME. 

EDIT: And dude, linking me to an entire thread of people who have completely changed their lives with a bit of exercise and fashion sense, and telling me you're still ugly, is like beating me around the face with the solutions to all of your problems while saying a solution doesn't exist. Seriously. Just go read what you just freaking showed me.  </TEXT>

Thank god I deleted her phone number, because I don't think I'd be able to restrain myself at the moment otherwise.

	<TEXT> I like to say "tell me the most awesome thing about yourself." Shows I'm interested in her, usually reveals something they're passionate about, and boosts their self esteem by allowing them to brag for a second. Also, if they come out with something shallow or stupid without thinking about their answer at all, it shows that they probably have very little maturity or self-introspection, and I know that they wouldn't be well suited to me. </TEXT>

Has she broken up with anyone recently, and can't relate to a new guy yet? A self esteem issue where she feels like she doesn't deserve you? (Unlikely I know, but I've seen a girl with depression remain convinced that no one could ever love her even after being asked out by a guy) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Firstly, I suggest you xpost to /r/singing. They get these kind of requests on a daily basis.

Also, your audition song doesn't have to be about the same thing as the show - especially with a character this specific. If it's a funny show, go a character song. If it's more serious, likewise.

For your range (which I suggest you edit into the original post, along with your age), I suggest [I'm Not That Smart](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2M93eivYXr4) from The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee  as a lighthearted character song, and [Valjean's Soliloquy](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GrJeP9FKN0) as a more serious alternative. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is going to sound terribly specific, but I suggest you try to get into some Music/Performing Arts circles. All of my best friends are musicians, and (with obvious exceptions) they are the kindest, most generous, most fun and by far the most outgoing people you will ever meet. They make friends very quickly and easily, and never have too many, so you'll be welcomed into a group within minutes.

While these types of people obviously are not perfect (can be very egotistical, competitive, and bitchy if you get on their bad side, eccentric as hell), they seem to me to be the best option for getting out of the situation you're in quickly. Giving up on my more conventional 'friends' and increasing my socializing with these guys single-handedly solved my loneliness, found all of my best friends and my first (  subsequent) girlfriend(s), and gave me plenty of things to get out and do/see.

So maybe join a local community choir or theatre company. Join a band/orchestra if you can play an instrument. Trust me, good times will be had. </TEXT>

It's part of the 'nice guy' phenonemon - there's a great thread about it over [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/lncn2/compiled_a_kill_nice_guy_with_fire_guide_for_men/) - wherein he just does not understand all of the social signals you have sent him to say back off. You have no other option but to tell him in no uncertain terms he's not wanted. He be a bit unhappy, but he will learn from the experience and do much better with interpersonal interactions in the future.

If you aren't brutally honest about what he's doing wrong, he'll be one of the sorry creatures that rants about how they are in the 'friendzone' and 'she keeps going out with guys who aren't as nice and dedicated as I am,' etc etc. You can save him the long term agony now with one frank conversation. </TEXT>
