	<TITLE> Tab movement breakup - Australis </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-06-03 13:38:39 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I like Australis among the flaws that several have reported.  

One thing that totally breaks up the user experience is the sliding tab movement.  

What I've noticed it that is as long as the mouse pointer stays in the tab's area, then movement is smooth and perfect as usual; but the moment i go a bit down and over the Awesome bar or anything in vicinity, the drag movement abruptly stops.  
Honestly, its a total ruin because nobody can be so precise in maintaining the drag movement in such a small area.  

Please borrow idea from the competition and extend the drag-able area to the Awesome Bar also.  
Only then during fast browsing session can people feel the speed, mainly due to lack of disruption. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sorry for the confusion  

i meant that an upward scroll of a few lines and "all the way up"scroll will reveal this toolbar menu.( if you use the new Facebook app you'll probably understand much easier) :)  

At the top position of the page the toolbar should be shown as default

	<DATE> 2014-05-24 14:56:19 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Since most of the highly used buttons of a browser are tucked away and accessing them requires more click or taps, i felt a disappearing toolbar area just like the way the new Facebook app does with 'Status|Photos|Activity' bar on the bottom would be great.  

Screenshot - https://imgur.com/Efav1kc

For  once you start scrolling down, it neatly hides its self, and only reveals when your are scrolling all the way up or are already at the top of the page.  
This way you still get back all the screen space and the most used buttons are always available to the users upfront. </TEXT>

Yeah that's true, its just that it would be great if important buttons are laid out like the desktop version....hey! wait, is it possible to have a disappearing menu/button bar area, just like the new facebook app which has "status | photos | activity" that disappears while scrolling down and re-appears while upward scroll? </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  If the phone has a physical menu button, no menu should be displayed, unless the app has an outdated Manifest (might be the case for Twitter for all I know).  

Yeah that's it, the tradeoff between physical/virtual menu button. i feel it'll be best left to the user if he/she wants to enable the 3 dot menu button on phones with a physical menu button. 

i feel the most important buttons such as back, forward, refresh should be in a much more easily accessible location on the screen, instead of going through a menu.  


And thank you for the mention of gestures- will get an add on right away :D

	<TEXT> on large screen phones, while holding it one hand, reaching the menu key to refresh or reload the page is painfully annoying.   
People need to shift the phone position just to do a simple refresh.  
And on large screen size phone's the 3 dot menu is not provided(due to design guidelines by google), but the Twitter app has still provided it. Some sort of fix or user choice enable/disable menu/custom button should be provided near the tab count icon. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Its a Micromax A110 Canvas 2.
Yes it is has capacitive buttons on the bottom of the screen.

But the lack of a Soft-Menu button is a deal-breaker :(  
Since this is a phablet type(5-inches) device moving the finger from the screen to the bottom just to access menu button is quite frustrating. 

The FF team should have provided this option to the users to enable/disable the virtual menu button :( :(

Edit - runs on stock android jelly bean 4.1.1 </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Damn you've got to be kidding me.  

Linux has Bug report systems like ABRT, Bugzilla. And they do a Better job than Send Error Report(which i haven't seen fix any errors).  

I dont know if you mean Autodesk 3ds Max, Maya, CATIA  as poorly designed apps. But ive got a heck load of problems when i used to work with them. 

And as for so called "unix distros don't have any central company to supply updates"  
Maybe you should use Ubuntu or Fedora and see how wonderful they handle updates.(That includes core kernel updates without breaking the system).
Also you're able to Upgrade the entire OS to the latest version from these central repositories. 

I use windows for my gaming, i love it for that. Its the only place it shines.  For work its Linux, because its reliable and stays solid

	<TITLE> What Fedora needs to do to lure in new users? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-03-19 19:04:26 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Since Fedora is a community based Distro, i feel it'll be great to have some feedback from them itself for the Fedora Project to be leaders again in the Free Linux OS field.

I've been using Linux dating long back to Redhat Linux 7 and onwards.
There have been amazing changes. Since ive used Linux so long, its real hard for me to go back to my Windows OS.

Here are few areas i feel Fedora Project need to pay more attention to:

1. Looks:  
We have all the icons and everything is symbolic. Its perfect. But where it lacks is that its not aesthetically pleasing. People always tend to judge a product by its finish and looks. One amazing example here is Apple - Im sure most mac buyers don't go into the details of the OS or its usage and purpose, but just give into the looks of the product. The color palette needs a refresh i feel. 
Currently its functional not pleasing (from the eyes of a normal user)

2. Tutorials:  
We need to provide the common user an OFFICIAL source of Text and Video based tutorial regarding things like installation, Music, Movies, App Installation etc. It should be clean and no Gimmicks. And the best way to host them would be TORRENTS! 

3. Default Packages:  
This is one part im a bit sad about. Previous version of Fedora came with the big guns of open source like GIMP, games etc. but most of it is removed these days. 
Normal people wont want all the other packages(they consider it junk) just like all the those preloaded android phone apps from manufacturer's.

4. Do NOT scare the new user   
New users Judge a product within 30 seconds i feel. If they feel its complex, they leave, if its too simple, they question and wonder. Just provide what is needed. FAQ are the best way to address.

5. Bug Reports  
This is daunting for a new user. They go through this unknown thing called ABRT, then Bugzilla, (GOD WHAT's Happening :O) They have been scared to death already now. We need to simplify this process. And make them understand how things work on the open source end.

6. Customization  
This was what Linux is all about.  
Fedora needs to point users to where they can find new content like themes, icons (that's what a normal user cares to find)  

7. Proprietary Package  
I know this is the No! NO! but normal user eventually need them for their Graphic Cards etc. The community should make people understand that its OK for them to install but the packages are responsibility of the company providing them. A video might help clear the air. 

8. Media, Formats etc  
Another important area where we should educate users that they can watch their favorite movies, or listen to songs in Open Source Formats, BUT, since half the world moves on mp3, avi etc, options are always available to install player like VLC etc.

9. Social Media  
Maybe the open world doesn't agree with Facebook but that's where users are and that's where users share their content. We need to make a definite presence.

10. Presentation  
Easy to understand, clean and visually beautiful. Hit them right and i guess the world will start following.

We have YouTube/Torrents to share all this Tit-bits of knowledge for free!

Do share in  your views! :)

The white outline surrounding the icons, like the bookmarks, home etc. really help visibility! :D. Hope it comes to the actual release!

I've tried uninstall and reinstall the packages and drives using "yum reinstall bumblebee bbswitch bumblebee-nvidia" to no avail.
Anybody else here in the same boat?

There is a severe lag, when the connection is slow.

Why cant it be stored in the SD-Card or the Hard disk and be loaded straight from there?   </TEXT>

The lyrics appear to be -- "don't you worry ... about the flight yeah ..." ... "careful and true... we've flown..." ..."sing for the way we've grown... we grow..."
