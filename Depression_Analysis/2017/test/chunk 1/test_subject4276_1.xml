	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> As a part of my get healthy plan, I'm quitting soda completely for a month (I'm only assuming that's how long it will take for me to not crave it, but really I want to quit until it's not something I want to drink every day) and then after that I'm limiting myself to one, per week MAX, whether it's at home, out and about, or at a restaurant. Otherwise my drink of choice is water.

Over the last few months I let myself go and I pretty much stopped taking care of myself and drank a LOT of soda. Before I was always good at drinking it only in moderation but now every time I drink it I just feel like a fat unhealthy piece of crap. So no more soda!

What are some other healthy drinks I can have? I have a hard time trusting anything from a grocery store...everything is loaded with sugars nowadays... </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Why did Microsoft change headset connectors for the 360 controller? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2012-04-20 00:52:59 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> And why did they make the chat pad incompatible with the older style headset controllers? 

I personally find the headsets to be annoying since the volume and on/off switch have to be dangling I stead of just being attached to the controller. With the newer headsets you have to take your hand off the controller to turn the mic on or off which is incredibly frustrating and distracts from the game. If someone walks into the room and wants to talk to me in the middle of the game I can't just easily turn the mic off. 

I'd like to buy the chat pad for messaging but what's the point if I have to use one or the other? WHY MUST MICROSOFT FORSAKE ME SO? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> How can I troll my freeloading neighbors via my "free" wifi with DD-WRT? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2012-04-19 09:43:14 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I've tried setting up security on my Buffalo router but it seems like every device I own will drop and reconnect every 10 minutes or so which is really aggravating. I've never had this problem with my wifi being open though. I know I can filter approved MAC addresses but I don't want to alienate anyone who comes over with their phone or laptop and want to use my wifi. I don't want to have to find out every MAC address from people who come over, and not all of them are even tech savvy so that's not the best solution.

So now I've come to want to troll the people who are using my wifi. I don't know who's doing it because I don't interact with my neighbors too often. I thought about setting up something where they can pay $10/mo per computer they connect with that goes to my paypal, but the paranoid in me thinks they will complain to the ISP that I'm reselling their service and have them shut me down.


Another thing I thought of is to change my SSID to "I can see what you're downloading"


I messed around with some of the settings and so far, I've filtered the offending neighbor's MAC addresses so that they get a max of 1500kbps down and 100kbps up. I'm also in the process of setting up access policies for the same MAC addresses to block all p2p traffic and block websites based off of the keywords "porn" and "facebook"

What else can I do that I can chuckle myself to sleep at night? </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> It seems like everywhere on the internet and out in the real world people always proclaim how amazing that fast food place is. I can understand liking it but anytime someone has a different opinion they are quick to attack it. Why fight over which shitty food is slightly less shitty than some other shitty food? It's all fast food, and none of it is very good. I had it for the first time last summer and honestly it didn't seem any different from any other fast food restaurant. They just have a more "efficient" way of taking orders because they have less items on the menu so people who don't know what they want don't have to stare as long. I don't understand why everyone thinks it's so amazing. I'll cook a burger on my own grill/stove any day.

	<TITLE> Reddit, I am short, balding, unhealthy, lazy, overweight, unattractive, and unhappy with what I'm doing with my life, I feel like I've hit a mid-life crisis, but I'm only 22 years old...What do I do? </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I always tell myself I need to do this, and I need to do that, but how do I go beyond telling myself? I can never actually bring myself to do it. Every once in a while I am able to get myself to a gym and I find myself actually having a good time cycling or using the elliptical for an hour listening to my music and I enjoy myself, but despite that it's still a struggle to even get that far. I feel unhappy with my life and the minimal things I have accomplished. I feel extremely unattractive, and it doesn't help that thanks to my family's genes, all my fat accumulates in my belly, so I almost look as if I'm pregnant.


The only good thing I've felt that has happened to me in the last couple years is getting married. I love her very much and I couldn't ever possibly see myself with any other woman. Somehow she saw through any physical or mental facade I had and saw the real me. But my problem is I don't even know who I really am anymore. It is hard for me to get out of bed every morning, and if I didn't have any other obligations, I would lie in bed all day. I set multiple alarms for myself and I cancel each and every one when they go off in the morning. Even if the alarm is on the other end of the apartment. I will get up, turn it off, and go back to bed.


I eat unhealthy food and can't make myself eat things that are good for me. I feel like I'm in a cycle of self destruction and I can't get out. It's killing me from the inside but I only keep making it worse day by day. I need help, what do I do?


**edit** Thanks a ton for all the replies guys. I promise that I've read every single comment that was a reply to the post (I don't know if I'll be able to get through all the subcomments). I am indeed a very disorganized person, and people have given me links to places that can help me keep track and help me set goals for myself. The first step I am taking will be to wake up at specific times every day (save for the one or two days a week where I work until 3am). My plan will be to wake up, eat a healthy breakfast, and go to the gym. I think I'll also pay for a personal trainer so I can get some sort of workout plan since I really don't know much about the gym and when I go I just mindlessly do stuff with no direction (this will help in the goals department) </TEXT>

It's not the best cable management but it is pretty much the most I can do. The only place I can hide the un-used cables is to shove them into the 5.25" slots.

[I can't believe how much smaller the 6570 is compared to my old nVidia 7800GT](http://i.imgur.com/Euvm1.jpg). It was always annoying because the power connector faced where the hard drives were and it was an extremely tight squeeze which regularly made maintenance a pain.

	<TITLE> Hey Reddit, I'm getting drunk on my first Reddit birthday. What are your favorite drinks? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2012-02-18 06:09:44 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> What do you like to drink? What's your favorite alcohol? Do you prefer straight up shots, mixed drinks, or beer? What is your favorite drunk story? Do you drunk call, text, Reddit, or internet?

Auto correct is such a godsend while drunk!

I love fireball whiskey. I bought a whole case of it last time it was on sale. I usually drink whiskey over any alcohol. I hate beer it tastes nasty. I only drink it when I'm drunk enough that my tongue is numb so I can't taste

What do you eat while drunk? I'm quite partial to pizza!

I haven't eaten anything today so I didn't have to drink that much to get drunk! I like it that way. Less alcohol to buy. I'm at the point where my face is numb!

I don't have many stories with me being drunk because I shunned alcohol for a while. But you know what? I don't care anymore. My side job is sitting with a bus driver either Thursday, Friday, or Saturday to transport drunk people around. We usually get 70-100 people per night. That job is so easy and I'd consider myself somewhat of a pro at handling drunk people when I am sober, but I love being one of them. Its awesome when I get on the bus when I'm drunk because I dont even have to remember where I live since I'm friends with the drivers.

Thanks for reading this Reddit night crew. I love social interaction when I'm drunk despite being somewhat of an introvert. My wife and my friend and I are about to get on the bus to go downtown in 15 min </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I can't seem to ever find the motivation to do anything I want to do. I just waste away and do absolutely nothing. At the end of every day I am ashamed of myself of not setting forth to accomplish the goals I set for myself and I tell myself I will do better tomorrow, and it all begins with waking up. 

I want to get around 6-7 hours of sleep, but no matter how rested I feel when I wake up, I still lie in bed, pressing snooze or even setting the alarm to a later time. I sleep until I feel tired from sleeping too much. Any plans that I had that I planned for the morning before I started my day will not get done, there is no time. I feel as though I never get out of bed unless I have an obligation to go to such as work or school. I've tried moving my alarm so it's not next to my bed, hell I've put it downstairs so I actually have to walk down the stairs to turn it off. And what do I do? I climb back in bed and sleep for another hour.

How can I convince myself that going to the gym in the morning is an obligation BEFORE I go to class? I'm overweight, out of shape, unhealthy, and eat only two-sometimes one meal a day. I want to change this. I need to wake up after 6 hours of sleep, I need to go to the gym, I need to eat healtheir, but how do I begin? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> What stupid mistake have you made turned out better than expected? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2011-11-30 17:18:03 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> When I was a freshman in college living in the dorms, I decided one night that I wanted to go out and get some McDonalds. I had stayed up all night finishing a project and came back and slept away the afternoon and the food halls were closed by the time I woke up.

I don't usually like eating by myself at a fast food restaurant, plus I'd rather have been watching TV/sitting at the computer while eating so I got my food to go. When I got to my car I put my food on top of the car so that I could put my soft drink into my cupholder. And there's the mistake I made. The classic "order something to go, and put it on top of the car, and completely forget as you get into the car and drive off" mistake.

Of course I was completely oblivious that I was forgetting something vital to my nourishment that night as I got into my car. Not only until I got most of the way back (just outside of my parking lot) that I realized something had gone horribly wrong. But that's when I spotted it. It was a miracle, a godsend, a grand triumph. Something was flapping in the wind over the top of the spoiler on my car! Yes, you guessed it! It was my McDonalds bag of food! It slid all the way down from the top of my car, and the bulk of the weight got wedged underneath the spoiler only to have the top of the bag freely flap around.

I quickly parked my car and ran back to retrieve my spoils that I had so carelessly forgotten about in my hungry stupor. The very main reason I had left the confines of my warmly flourescent-lit room made of brick and tile. The safety of the carefully selected position of my desk. The blue glow of the lights emitting from my computer tower. Much to my surprise, the food was still very warm, and all items I had ordered were accounted for.

I rushed up the four flights of stairs to my room. Today there was a triumph. I could have lost something vital to my very identity as a human being. I devoured my meal with much vigor. The fact that it was nearly lost to the solid black rivers of transportation that we call roads made it that much more delicious. The events of tonight had truly went better than expected.

TL;DR: I put food on top of my car and left it there on accident. It got stuck under my spoiler and rode all the way home and I didn't even lose a single fry. </TEXT>

I don't need any more hard drives other than the SSD, I already have about 10tb laying around. I don't need any monitors or speakers.

Problem is, I don't even know where I should start for the build. And with black friday around the corner, I don't know what deals I should be looking for to get the most bang for my buck </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2011-11-19 06:47:03 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I recently installed the update for the appstore app and while visually the app looks great, it has been a nuisance ever since. It's all in the notifications. 

I'm fine with a notification telling me I have an update, but not allowing me to close the notification from the notification bar is just plain wrong. There's no reason why I should be forced to open the app to see that update. 

Another notification problem: the app decided to try to download an app/update even though i have it set to wifi download only. But instead of actually downloading, i had a lovely status bar in my notifications that read 0% all day long. Again, no way to close the notification and when I opened the app, it didn't even say it was downloading. 

I tried looking in the settings but i couldn't for the life of me find an option to disable notifications. I went into my Android application settings to see if I could just force close the app but even though i kept getting these notifications every hour it didn't say the app was running. That leaves my only option which is to uninstall it which I don't want to do.  </TEXT>

Anyone else use these mods? Have any cool builds you did? Unfortunately I don't have anything to share because it takes a while to get up and running! Though the high amount of gems you can use for pickaxes help a lot! that way you can leave diamonds for pipes and gears </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2011-10-29 11:37:57 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I really think that something needs to be done about experience orbs. When a player dies in SMP it creates way too many floating entities. I just died on a server from a creeper and all the experience orbs just about crashed the server. I had to lag my way slowly over to where the orbs were and sit there for a whole two minutes so that I could pick up what felt like half a million experience orbs. Stuff like this CAN'T be good for larger servers with more people online and possibly more than a few dying at the same time. I was the only one online at the time of this happening, so I can't imagine what would have happened if there were more online.


When there is a lot of experience orbs in one area, they should group together and become one to a few large orbs instead of a ton of tiny ones.


As for how hard this would be to implement? I don't really know, but *something* has to be done because it's a near game-breaking thing.

	<TITLE> Apps/utilities for the outdoorsman? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2011-10-25 07:00:09 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Rifle Hunting season opening weekend was last weekend here in Montana. I brought my phone with me, as I bring it everywhere, and as I expected, there was no service up in the mountains. I was messing around with it and much to my surprise and enjoyment, I found out that my phone doesn't have an aGPS chip/unit, it actually has a standalone one, so I was able to use GPS Essentials and plot waypoints and see how far they were from my position and all that all without needing a cell phone signal. Talk about nerdgasm! I wasn't expecting to do anything on my phone but play some offline games I had.


Now this leads to the point of this post: what apps out there are good for the outdoorsman who has no wireless signal? I found that Google Maps caches some maps (I presume the surrounding area of wherever you live, as my entire city I could zoom all the way in on in Maps, but my current position was just a blur). But I'd like to go further, is there an app where you can cache maps from google maps, or load other maps into it so I can see where I am via GPS and plot waypoints to navigate through the mountains? GPS Essentials did a lot but I'd like to take it a step further. I'd like to see maps and record where I went and see how far I traveled. For some reason the tracks function in GPS Essentials only records the distance between the starting point and the end point in a straight line, instead of distance traveled. 

Another awesome thing I could use is an app where I can load maps that show me private and public plots of land. Sometimes while driving along the road we see something but we don't always know whether the land out there is private or public. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> The wife and I are trying to find some horror movies. We always watch the same movies year in and year out during October. It's hard for us to want to stray from those movies and spend money on something that turns out to be a gorefest. The problem for me is that the horror category groups both creepy/scary movies in with slasher flicks. We like paranormal movies, not stuff like Saw. I mean some death is fine but i just don't like movies just full of people dying gory deaths. I want something that will be haunting or make my skin crawl. 

Any suggestions?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I made an underground tree farm in a server I play on. I noticed that when one grew, it only had one or two leaf blocks on it. I thought that was strange so I went to walk over to it and I got stuck where leaves usually are. I logged out and in only to find that the leaves did indeed spawn with the tree...but for some reason they were invisible to me. The only way for me to see the leaves to chop down the tree is to log out and in after the tree grew </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Usually when i drink with friends I just take a shot here or there but I barely ever get a decent buzz going. So last night was the first night in two weeks I could drink and either not have to sit at home or worry about a ride home so I said FUCK IT. I wanted to take the fast track so i drank 4 double shots of fireball whiskey before getting a ride to the bars. 

I had an awesome fucking night and I don't even know why... We barely did anything! But for some reason everything was funny and everyone was amazing. If you can't tell it was my first real time being drunk. I didn't even realizz I was drunk until someone told me I was... I kept insisting I was only tipsy. I also retained the ability to use proper Grammer while drunk texting/IMing  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Just a friendly reminder about the Streamline LateNight Bus </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2011-08-30 00:55:54 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I looked through all the daytime routes and it doesn't appear that anything has changed unless it was too minor for me to notice. Maybe times have changed but I don't think so. The only major thing is a couple buses have a half hour service for "peak hours"

Both Upstream and Downtown start an hour earlier each night (Friday and Saturday, and Thursday, Friday, and Saturday respectively). So Downtown runs between 8PM and 3AM and Upstream runs between 9PM and 3AM. Last pickup at the bars is at 2AM. As usual Upstream runs up to campus twice within the last run. Once at 1:50 and again around 2:10 (or however long it takes to get up and drop everyone off and come back)

Downtown's route changed a bit. We do not run up to the Greyhound anymore. and we do not go past Catamount and the First Student bus depot, instead we drive right between Target and Costco. We now drop off right across the street from the side of Wal-Mart instead of by the gas station across 7th Ave. And we now drive past the Filler


Maybe one day I'll see a fellow redditor on the bus!

	<TEXT> I live in a college town and the city doesn't have any public transportation. Instead we have a bus system that started five years ago that is mostly paid for by tuition and the whole operation is ran by students, aside from the drivers and bus maintenance ... That is contracted out to a company. 

Every Thursday, Friday, and Saturday there is a bus that runs from 8 to 3am.  Our last run is when the bars close and everyone is drunk and needs a ride home. I keep them under control and make sure no fights break out and take the necessary actions if an incident does occur. I've never had anything I've had to call the cops for though... I've had relatively good luck and haven't had too many rowdy crowds. Once we fit 100 people on a bus that seats 23 to go to a hockey game 

I have about an hour to the last run right now and usually this run is pretty quiet so AMA </TEXT>

	<TITLE> PC remote/trackpad app?  </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2011-08-26 10:54:12 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I was just wondering if anyone else uses an app on an android device for a HTPC.  

First i found teamviewer which is awesome for remote desktop which could be useful to me in the future for troubleshooting and also i thought it was damn cool that i could connect to my laptop over 3g to track progress on a download. After this i got the idea that i could use the app as a sort of remote when i connect my laptop to the tv to watch videos instead of having to either get up and lay on the floor to navigate or pill out mt keyboard and mouse and use that on the coffee table. It worked well,  however whenever i would disconnect the application would pop up with a message saying thanks and whatnot. I didnt want to stay connected with the phone for obvious reasons so this didn't work too well. 

Then i came across remotedroid which was awesome. Works like a trackpad + keyboard over wifi.. You just start an application on the computer and connect via ip with the phone app. However it gets glitchy every once in a while and i cant seem to get rid of the keyboard without disconnecting from the laptop. The other problem is that i occasionally have to ctrl + scroll up to increase text size on websites to read on my tv from the couch... And that is not possible with this app. 

So now I'm wondering... Is there any better apps out there that r/Android can recommend to me?  </TEXT>

My cat got a little too playful last night and bit me pretty hard... For some reason this particular tooth mark is really bad... The others are fine. But this. One has been hurting and swollen since the moment he but me. It's difficult to move my wrist as there is a sharp pain every time i try to use my hand. I asked someone at a pharmacy and he said most likely some neosporin will help it but that was hours ago and it still is swollen and still hurts...

	<TEXT> I saw them the first week they started up but my schedule didn't seem to meet up with when they'd be out.  Finally got a chance tonight at the reopening of the Rocking Real Bar. It was definitely some good bbq.  Cole slaw on the sandwich and all! I highly recommend to try it out if you like bbq. I'm hoping that this isn't the last food truck that Bozeman will see. I was in California for a couple weeks this month and the food trucks there were awesome and i'm glad it's spreading elsewhere. 

If you want to check out their site its at www.pigstymobilebbq.com

	<TEXT> If people come to your door selling magazines in order to go on a trip, and they look around 25 years old and talk about "points". Call the police immediately and tell them the direction they went in. Do not let them come into your house to fill out forms under any circumstance. I managed to get my entire wallet stolen with lots of personal information. I've just spent the last 2 or 3 hours cancelling my cards and talking to the police.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I was recently talking to someone about spaceship design and we discussed how 99% of all games/tv shows/movies don't portray ship movement right and suddenly I had a moment of nostalgia and remembered that demo of that awesome game that never really got released from so long ago. Nexus was still good but it never lived up to what IG3 was supposed to be and the gameplay felt kindof shallow compared to how complex IG3 was. And if you ask me, even when the demo came out, the game was way ahead of its time, especially in the regard to particle effects



Here are some screenshots:

I'm just wondering if anyone else gets in the same nostalgia boat that I'm in whenever I think about this game. It's the same one where we mourn great games that never got to see the light of day. (though this one in some form sortof did). I just tried to install the demo and play it again for old time's sake but alas, the installer won't work on Windows 7 =\ </TEXT>
