Taken from the site.

Heres The Deal

Since 2003, weve set up and organized Childs Play, a game industry charity dedicated to improving the lives of children with toys and games in our network of over 70 hospitals worldwide. Over the years, you as a community have answered the call and come together to raise millions of dollars.

Childs Play works in two ways. With the help of hospital staff, we set up gift wish lists full of video games, toys, books, and other fun stuff for kids. By clicking on a hospital location on our map, you can view that hospitals wish list and send a gift.

Childs Play also receives cash donations throughout the year. With those cash donations, we purchase new consoles, peripherals, games, and more for hospitals and therapy facilities. These donations allow for children to enjoy age-appropriate entertainment, interact with their peers, friends, and family, and can provide vital distraction from an otherwise generally unpleasant experience.

Also happy B-Day and this is one of the best contest ive seen on ROAP. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I once let a friend buy me for a day for 20 bucks. She had me do all types of stupid shit, her laundry, her nails, cleaning, cooking. Then after the two hours of that wore off she started to get creative. She put me in a skirt and tank top and had me go to our local video store and rent the most off the wall porn (rim jobs, interracial gay porn, granny, tranny, gay gang bangs, ect ect). After that fun she had me get naked and run around the apartment complex a few times, had me make her dinner, tuck her in for bed, sleep on the floor so I could be up early to make her whole family breakfast. Tons of different things for the remaining 24 hours, pack her bong hits, call her mistress, rub her feet. Then as the time was winding down she pulled the whole "i want you too eat me for the rest of your time". Needless to say I did. That was the best bag of bud Ive ever had. 

The whole eating her out thing didnt happen. But a few months later it did and we hooked up for a few months. Man she was awesome. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So one day in 2005, I get up and notice I have some kind of spider bite on my inner thigh. I slept in the basement so thats what I chalked it up too. So I get outta bed and start getting ready too go to work since i overslept. As im getting dressed my leg starts throbbing and swelling, I say "eh" walk out the door to work. As im walking I can feel it hurting and swelling more and more. Make it to work, get told to get in the kitchen someone called off (the other guy who closed with me) and we are busy as shit. So I limp on past the GM and a normal manager. They ask whats wrong I tell them, get in the kitchen, bust out all the orders for about maybe an hour.
 
Thats when the pain set in. On a scale of 1 to 10 I was at a 50. So here i am on the floor, basically in tears, all sweaty and holding my leg, while the other guys in the kitchen make food. Manager comes back asks whats wrong, I tell her I have too leave something is really wrong with my leg and I cant work if I cant stand. Here is what she tells me "If you leave you are fired, that's not coming from me thats from the GM" I flip shit "What the fuck do you mean he left like an hour ago" 

Apparently as I came limping in the GM (who was a piece of shit human being to begin with, thats another story) Tells the manager "I bet he and Nick (guy who called off) are up too some bullshit they probably planed this out, If he tries too leave fire him". 

So I do end up leaving going too the hospital and turned out that I had MRSA. MRSA is some serious shit if you dont know if it gets into your blood stream it call kill you. So I get an IV pain pills all that fun stuff, get a doctors note saying that I cant work until im healed. Call the manager tell her whats up she tells me, Im still fired and she will mail my check too me. 

So too finish up, after i can work again, I call the higher ups, tell them what happened, we have a meeting with all parties involved, they admit they did wrong and agree too hire me back. They tell me too come in on Thursday, I come in on Thursday and they say "we told you wednesday your fired agian."

Cunts

	<TEXT> Lets see the last time she saw her was about 2 weeks ago for about 2 hours and thats because I told her come see her. Before that it was easily over 3 months since shes seen her. Ill give a few attorneys a call and see if any of them say anything helpful. I just have a feeling that somehow someway she could turn it all around on me. and make herself out too be the "victim" she is quite good at that. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Im 58 hours in and only at 67% -_-.  Gotta love the randomness of this game and the challenge. I really want too get all the items before the update comes out, its going to add 100 or so items, new pills, 5 alternate levels for the existing ones, a new level on the end. So worth buying if anyone hasnt. 

 Congratulations OP. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So here the story im flat broke as of yesterday, I live on my own with my daughter so most of my check goes to her (she has tons of food because of WIC) and I rely on my food card too get me between checks. But I cant go shopping for food until around the 3rd, when my card refills. So im pretty screwed on having dinner. :( Sadly i have nothing to give in return but all my internets.
Im in Licking County, OH </TEXT>
