	<TEXT> "In My Life" has been one of my favorite songs my whole life because I grew up on Beatles. Then my dad passed away when I was 13 and they played that at his funeral and it was the sweetest thing ever. Especially because he got me into The Beatles. It still makes me think of him to this day and that's why I still love the song so much. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm sorry bro *virtual hugs* That's gotta suck. We both kinda sound like we're in the same boat. This guy asked out a girl about 2 or 3 weeks ago and she dumped him after twelve hours and to my knowledge, he's still single. The fact that she dumped him so fast kinda made me smile. Karma, ya know? I'd be a lot less upset with him if he didn't completely cut me off after he promised he didn't want to hurt me but he had to do it because he felt he would have ended up hurting me by the time even worse if we had kept dating. Which sounded like bull to me. and we could be friends. Really, whenever I tried to make things right or talk to him he ignored me and recently deleted me off Facebook. He also kissed another girl near the end of our relationship because they were both going through hard times but he said it didn't mean anything and I didn't find out til about 2 days after our breakup. Sorry I didn't mean to turn that into a rant. But message me sometime dude.3 Feel better. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm 14 years old and one month ago Saturday, my boyfriend (also 14) broke up with me. He said that he was under a lot of stress and was having family issues and that he didn't want to break up with me but he had to because he didn't want to end up hurting me. When he broke up with me, the both of us were just sobbing. Then fast forward about 3 days. I found out he kissed another girl who was raped recently while he was still with me. When I asked him about it, he said that I deserved to know the truth and he did but they were talking about what happened to her and they kissed without thinking, and he has no feelings for her and isn't dating her. I haven't tried talking to him since then and he hasn't tried talking to me, but today I broke and sent him a message on Facebook. It said "Hey, I know you're probably not really wanting to hear from me and idk if you're upset with me or anything but I've been kinda worried about you because of how you were last time we talked, and I just wanted to make sure you were okay. Are things going any better for you at all? /:" He didn't reply yet, but he hasn't been online and I just sent it about 5 hours ago. I was in tears for about the first week of our breakup, then the next two I was fine, and now I'm in pieces again. I saw a picture of him on facebook and legitimately started crying. This boy was my first kiss and my first real boyfriend. We went extremely far physically which is something I'm not proud of, but it's the past. We are going to different high schools this year as well, so I won't be able to see him during school either. I just miss him so much. I keep having dreams that I see him somewhere, and we make up, and everything is back to how it used to be. I just feel like I'm never going to get better. The only thing I want right now is to be able to see him and talk about things. I just need so much closure right now and I just want us to get back together and I want things to be how they used to be. I miss his smile, I miss cuddling with him while we listened to music, I miss Facetiming with him every single day for hours and hours. Reddit, how do I get over it? And should I keep trying to talk to him or should I back off? Thanks.

EDIT: Yeah. He didn't reply to my facebook message. It said that he saw it, but no reply. </TEXT>
