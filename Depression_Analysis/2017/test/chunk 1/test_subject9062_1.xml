But here, in the good ole US of A, weve allowed a group of rich, entitled thugs who run an operation fronting for arms dealersguys who represent a minority position on pretty much every issue having to do with reasonable regulation of firearms even among gun ownersto dictate our policies to cowardly, careerist politicians.

	<TEXT> Think harder. It's the fact that the NRA and congress repeatedly block laws that would keep firearms away from people proven to be emotionally disturbed like this fucker.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No, it's the sanest thing he could say. To blame a gun, maybe a stretch. But the reason that certifiable nutters like the shooter can GET guns is the NRA and their beholden in congress. Just fucking make people prove they are not crazy before buying lethal weapons. What is so fucking hard about that concept? Yet the NRA blocks research, encourages insane responses from the fringes of their already-radical members, and fans the flames of these mass shootings. Fuck. How can anyone see this suffering beautiful father, his life FUCKING RUINED by a proven-crazy fucker who's family contacted the sheriff for fucks sake, and who was still, still able to procure a gun!- and argue against blocking crazy folks from buying and owning firearms? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Nobody is going around spraying children with flying knives. However in the US we are sling people daily to gun terrorism. It's a plague we fight, despite trite trolls who claim cars kill people. In reality we license, inspect and keep a log of cars. If your car is stolen we can look up who has ever owned it, and trace via aerial number. That would be a great start to keeping track of the death toys.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Meanwhile in America...
[Detectives found 20 unsecured guns and thousands of rounds of ammunition throughout the home of the family of a 3-year-old boy who accidentally shot himself in the abdomen March 3, according to reports released last week.
The boy, who survived the shooting, was flown to a Tucson hospital where he underwent surgery.
The case is being referred to the Pima County Attorney's Office, according to a Pima County Sheriff's detective. The boy's parents, Don and Sharina Marion, have not been arrested or charged. Don Marion is the volunteer fire chief for Elephant Head Fire Department.](http://www.gvnews.com/news/local/unsecured-guns-found-in-house-where-toddler-shot/article_1c5facb8-d965-11e3-bba4-001a4bcf887a.html?mode=jqm) </TEXT>
