	<TEXT> If you judge the movie purely as a movie, It is very well made. I haven't seen anyone HATE on it, of course like any war movie it will cause some controversy (remember when The Hurt Locker came out?).
But I really don't really care about the controversy, because I always remember this: It's just a movie!!!!

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Just wanted to ask /r/movies what everyone thinks of The Reader, a 2008 film starring Kate Winslet, David Kross and Ralph Fiennes.

Wiki: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Reader_%282008_film%29

I think this is an incredible film with powerful and convincing performances from all three leads, this film is certainly not for everyone and it raised quite the controversy when it was released but nonetheless critics and people I know really liked this film. So yeah I just wanted to know what people thought of it, please leave your thoughts and opinion(s) in the comments. :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> At the beginning of the film where the drums play away the letters and start to reveal the title of the film it pauses briefly and across the screen you can see the word 'Amor'. Amor, as it turns out, is the ancient Roman God of love (aka Cupid) Amor is also Latin for 'Love'. I did more research and as it turns out Amor is winged and is often depicted as being blind or blindfolded. Now you must also consider the name of the play that the plot (sort of) revolves around. And know a quote from Shakespeare's A Midsummer Nights Dream:

Love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind
And therefore is winged Cupid painted blind.
Nor hath love's mind of any judgement taste;
Wings and no eyes figure unheedy haste.
And therefore is love said to be a child
Because in choice he is so oft beguiled.

IMHO this quote is referring to Riggan Thomson (or is it the other way round?) The director and writer, Alejandro Gonzlez Irritu, is not directly linking Riggan to Amor (or Cupid) but simply a homage or tip of the hat. As the title of this post suggests I may be onto something here and if I am then I am no where near fully understanding this reference. I thought I might share this with you guys and perhaps discuss even further. :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This album reflects humanity. The good. The bad. And the ambiguity of it. Most of this album is actually a continuous song. Most of it. The songs within this album evoke mostly dark emotions, but they are very relaxing. The lyrics of these songs deal with some very heavy themes. Mostly, like I said, to do with humanity; society. But the themes and ideas displayed in this album is familiar territory for this band. They are certainly not for everyone, they are for me and hopefully for you, too.
