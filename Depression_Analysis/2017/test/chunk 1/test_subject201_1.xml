	<TEXT> On this topic of having money and its dry... That really is ALWAYS the way, I dont know why, maybe supply and demand. I mean if you get a paycheck everyone else is getting a paycheck also and you would think dealers would be re-uping but I guess its the opposite. Anyways hope you score soon man, good luck.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes I have come across these a few time's. I think there great. Sometimes I actually prefer doing 3, pink 10mg oxys because it kinda tricks your brain into thinking your doing more than just 30mgs cause you have more powder. But yes these pink 10mg k-56's will have the same effect as a blue 30 if you do three. The extra filler doesn't add up to much. Enjoy!

	<TEXT> no, I didn't mean to lead you on. I didn't realize these sets have hardly any value. Its been about ten years and all the cards are in mint condition. I assumed I could get at least 100 or more but someone said they saw a set on amazon for 7-9 dollars. Guess I'm going to have to wait until they become more valuable.  </TEXT>

Ebay suggests to sell each card individually to make decent money but i don't have the time or patents. I'm willing to sell for a cheep, reasonable price. I am hard up for money right now so any offer would be pondered. I can send pics, lists, or anything for any serious inquiries. </TEXT>
