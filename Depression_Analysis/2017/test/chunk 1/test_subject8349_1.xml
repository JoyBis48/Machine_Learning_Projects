	<TEXT> I believe there are thousands, maybe millions of people who you could be extremely happy with and consider them your "soulmate". You may find a "soulmate" but keep in mind there are lots and lots of others who could make you as happy, or even happier than yours. You're with yours mainly because of where you live and have been to.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm from Portugal, and it's hard to find something I like here. We've got beaches, (usually) sunny weather and a cuisine that pleases many foreigners, but unfortunately I don't like any of that. I'd much rather life in a cold, snowy place like the Scandinavian countries or Canada. Oh well, maybe one day :)  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I wish they had been more strict about my behavior. I was a stupid "rebel" during Elementary school, without realizing it at the time. I also was rude to many adults then. My parent's punished me but it wasn't enough. Is that a weird thing to say? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When I was a kid, I ran to the road not knowing there was a car passing. My neighbor actually closed her eyes as she thought I was gonna be ran over. 
The other time was also when I was a kid, my mom was about to give me some medicine that was made for adults and could potentially kill me. Thankfully, she always reads the whole paper that came with it, and returned it to the pharmacy, where it had been recommended. The pharmacist got really nervous and apologized a lot. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> People who complain about how they have bad grades because of their teachers. There are cases when teachers are more demanding and harder on students, but in most cases they don't have good grades because they don't work for it, or their studying method needs optimization. I'm not that smart, people always seem to figure out how to solve math problems before I do and store more information than I am able to, but I usually have either the same or better grades than them, because I study more and harder than them. </TEXT>
