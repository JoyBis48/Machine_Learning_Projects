	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm trying to play all heists in order to get the $1mill bonus so i can buy a hydra. i started playing them and then my WIFI was disconnected for 8 weeks and now im finally carrying on with them. Due to the length of time i havent played, will this affect my chances of getting the bonus? Probably an obvious answer but i need to know. </TEXT>
