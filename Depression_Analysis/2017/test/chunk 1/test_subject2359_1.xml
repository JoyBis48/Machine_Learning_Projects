If you work a blue-collar job where your jeans get dirty and beat-up, this is bad.  You really need to wash them to preserve the fabric, or it'll wear through pretty fast.  Holes in jeans might be trendy, but not if you need them to stay intact for work. </TEXT>

So, what can I use to hold it firmly into a patty shape instead of egg?  I'm not allergic, or anything, I'm just kind of tire of the taste and texture, and looking for an alternative.

Also - is buttermilk good for frying up salmon cakes?  I was just going to go with flour   breadcrumbs, but it's not chicken ... so I wasn't sure about using buttermilk to fully batter. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When I click on a thumbnail with a + sign, the images no longer expand to full size right there on the page.  I have to (*quelle horreur*!) actually click on the link to open an image in a new tab.  The + changes to a - without anything anything happening.

I've changed absolutely no settings between when this function still worked, and when it stopped working.

	<TEXT> I know these used to exist, but I'll be damned if I can find one.

I'm basically looking for a program that will download all images on a site within a certain sub-address.  Not something for fuskering (I'm not looking to raid personal archives on Photobucket), but for sites that just have a lot of linked images, even some subreddits here - like, say, downloading a few months worth of pictures from /r/EarthPorn, without having to sit there and right click for hours. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I absolutely love what I've read of *A History of Western Civilization*, but I'm wondering if I should bother with the earlier volumes.  I'm concerned they may have been drastically outpaced by new scholarship, especially "Our Oriental Heritage," which was written in the '20s.  I'm not concerned by volumes like "The Age of Voltaire," which was not only written much later (the '60s), but about a more recent and better documented era. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I don't even have pictures of it.  

Anyways, back in the mid-80s (young people can go ahead and just leave now), a local pizza place had a billboard-style game on one wall.  It was about 6' x 3', and was played with an IR remote.  

There was a illustration of a hunter holding a shotgun standing in some reeds with a dog, and there were five cut-out positions for the shotgun.  They'd light up individually as you directed with the controller.  The ducks were also lit up sections of an otherwise black panel, and you'd have to have the gun aimed at the right angle to hit one.

Anyone else remember this? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So, I have a desk lamp made of wood and metal.

If it's off, I can touch any metal part and it will turn on. Another touch, it becomes brighter.  A third touch, it goes to its brightest.  A fourth touch ... it turns off.

There seem to be no moving parts.  So what, exactly, is going on here?  Are there moving parts inside of the (very small) wooden core, that switch around like those in a car's turn signal? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Just had a moderately strong one here in northern Plumas County.  Everything just shook and rolled for about fifteen to twenty seconds, and I could actually hear the rumble.

Kind of neat, but slightly disturbing, given that an active volcano is less than twenty miles away (Lassen) - I thought it must be erupting.

Anyone got any info?

EDIT: A 5.7-5.9, according to the USGS.  Epicenter was about eight miles away. </TEXT>
