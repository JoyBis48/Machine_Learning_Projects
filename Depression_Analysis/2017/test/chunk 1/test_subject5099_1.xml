	<TEXT> To those who would want to play in these matches, I would recommend not to. The OPs were spawning mobs to get rid of particular players, and down right annoy others. I had about 20 bats spawned on me on one occasion. Other players (regardless of who they were) had creepers spawned on them. I would not recommend playing these matches until their games are fair, and tolerant. </TEXT>

Replying "shut the fuck up" also is not, and was completely uncalled for, I replied back as narrow minded as you did. I'm not the only one that had a problem with your matches, or this being the first, and I'm sure, not the last, you may want to learn to respect people before they will respect you, and don't go "you swore at me, nyanya" While it may not have been one of the most mature things I've done, you swore at me first, and I don't "bow down" to hosts, I play with them mutually, and respect them. You, I have no respect for whatsoever.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Apparently you could have logged back in, and I had asked the host (who, contrary to what it says here, was t4t4t4t4, not actually_yes) why he had not replied, and he said he was afk. I then complained that he had said "this is an impromptu, do not complain about lag and bad hosting" and i said that gave no right to not host correctly. To that, actually_yes replied with "shut the f*ck up" and i replied back as narrow minded as he did. He then banned me for: faggot. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I personally think you could do well, but here is some feedback:

-Don't make PvP instantaneous, turn it off until first night or second day.
-Make the spawn box bigger and within the borders, the constant teleporting was quite annoying.

I do however, like your endgame of a re-scatter, and I would appreciate you trying again :) </TEXT>
