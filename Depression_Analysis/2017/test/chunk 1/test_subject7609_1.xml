	<TEXT> Hmm, that is something I didn't know, and you are right, certainly has a very large impact on results.

I'd like to see Blizzard eventually implement a mode with 2 out of 3s, and a 5-8 card sideboard only for games 2 and 3. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> A brief overview of MLG/managrind.com's November winning decklists </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-11-22 20:06:58 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> 23 total decks from 6 tourneys (11/2, 11/3,  11/9, 11/10, 11/16, 11/17). One tourney only reported top 3 decks, the rest had top 4. One tourney had 2 decklists for one place(switched mid tourney or sideboarded into, not sure), so I counted them as worth half each.

* Rogue - 37% (8.5 decks)
* Warlock - 22% (5 decks)
* Paladin - 13% (3 decks)
* Druid - 13% (3 decks)
* Mage - 11% (2.5 decks)
* Priest - 4% (1 deck)
* Hunter, Shaman, Warrior - 0%

Yes, the meta is undergoing a lot of changes and it's a relatively small sample size, but the player quality is likely high and the tournaments are large. I thought it provided an interesting view into the current metagame. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Priests are this game's control deck, OTK Hunters are this game's combo deck. Looking at tournament results and hearing opinions from top players, neither of these heroes are very good at the moment in comparison to some of the top classes.

Crying to nerf or change a class that isn't very good in the first place is crazy. Hearthstone needs variety in playstyles. Cutting the control and combo elements from a game is a horrible idea, and just devolves the game into an all aggro deck fest where who can curve out the best wins.

Maybe control or combo isn't fun for you, but playing aggro vs. aggro every match doesn't sound very fun to me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I mean, maybe you still use mind control, I'm not sure. It's just so slow and against a lot of decks the best thing you can steal is like a 4/5, and then you just get smashed and die. The 5+ SW I think is at best a one-of, and probably fine not playing it at all.

I used to play priest and switched to rogue, it just seems like as the meta gets more aggro there are fewer and fewer good matchups for priest. </TEXT>

They're a class I've even taken to avoiding in arena due to me getting much better results with others, the class heavily relying on picking up mind controls and a few other choice cards, and being very weak to 4 power swarm decks that can survive a turn 5 holy nova. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I play both, but quite honestly (and probably unpopularly) Hearthstone is much better right now. It seems like this thread is kind of a knee jerk reaction to hating the big mainstream company, or hating a competitor of a game that we love and are invested in.

To clarify - I think they are both interesting, well made base gameplay CCGs, and I don't think that either is more fun or deep than the other. Solforge is really lacking behind Hearthstone in a lot of ways, though -

* Draft. Right now Solforge has nothing, Hearthstone has arena mode fully implemented which is very enjoyable.

* Free rewards. Both games have daily quests/rewards that are easy to complete. Hearthstone however lets you disenchant cards you don't want and allows you to essentially trade in cards for any card in the game. Solforge, you're cracking crappy free packs and crossing your fingers for a rare - maybe hoarding silver, which we have no idea what it can even be used for.

* Pay to win factor. There is a little bit in both games, but this comes back to the fact that in hearthstone you can craft anything, and only have one legendary per deck. A deck that won a recent tourney, I was able to put together in 2 days not buying anything. In Solforge, 3x legendaries seem to be practically required if you want to play something tier 1 - zimus, phoenix, ghox etc.

* Polish. Blizzard clearly has the upper hand here, Hearthstone is extremely polished, looks and feels great. Solforge has server lag, timer issues, crashes when you open packs, etc...

Maybe all of this stuff gets ironed out when Solforge finally releases some updates, but as it stands I'm playing Hearthstone most of the night, then I'll login to play my 3 quick matches in solforge and quit because there's nothing to do in the game right now. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not really. Priests are pretty weak to strong 4 attack cards. Playing more of those and cutting some of your top end doesn't gimp you against the rest of the field. 

You aren't running an "anti priest deck", you are just metagaming. Look at chanmanv's unleash the hounds deck - it doesnt care about mind control at all, and hey, it's still pretty strong against the rest of the field!

If you want to keep dropping ysera turn 9 and then go to reddit complaining that priests are so op, go ahead, but you aren't working very hard to actually beat them </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's pretty similar.

Major Differences -

* in mtg you put land in decks, which you can play one a turn. these are essentially mana crystals. In mtg you need to think about how many land you want to put into your deck, as not drawing enough/too many will screw you - in hearthstone you just get the ideal 1 mana crystal per turn.

* In mtg you only declare you are attacking with a creature - the other player can choose to put one of their guys in front, or take the damage himself.

* In mtg you have opportunites to play spells during your opponent's turn.

These are the major differences, obviously there are plenty of other small differences but the basic gameplay is pretty similar otherwise </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I just drafted a 14 team league non-PPR, (1 QB 2 RB 2 WR 1 TE 1 FLEX 1 PK 1 TD), and am projected for a close week 1 matchup - within a point of yahoo projections. My defense is GB, playing SF. I'm not sure if GB has any value making it worth it to hold onto them, or if I should drop them and pick up a highly projected defense this week and each week after.

I'm looking at a few available - 

* WAS vs PHI
* KC vs JAX 
* IND vs OAK
* CLE vs MIA

I also could drop a bench player for a fill-in defense this week - likely Tannehill, but there are very few backup QBs available - Even EJ and Pryor are gone, leaving Geno, Ponder, and Henne/Gabbert as the only active QBs currently available if Tannehill gets scooped up.

My team for reference -

* QB -Andrew Luck, Ryan Tannehill
* RB -Trent Richardson, Steven Jackson, Reggie Bush, Ronnie Hillman
* TE - Jermichael Finley, Dwayne Allen
* WR - Antonio Brown, Miles Austin, Kenny Britt, Josh Gordon, Justin Blackmon
* PK - Randy Bullock
* TD - Green Bay Packers

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm new to the game(FE:LH), picked it up during summer sale. I feel I get most of the mechanics but this is bugging me. Just looking to hear if there is a concensus, as once I start to get many hero units, it becomes slightly overwhelming.

- I generally keep a hero unit in each of my cities to defend it. My cities are protected, but my unit never levels up unless the city is heavily attacked, which is very rare. Is this smart, or should I just use basic forces like militias to defend?

- Is it wise to put multiple hero units in one army? Does this cause exp degradation? I generally don't do this, but will often combine heroes if I want to make an assault on a city early (for example in the first scenario, I used my sovereign, jormur the giant, and the giant golem you get from the quest...didn't even initially realize they were hero units)

- Should your heroes all just be wandering and exploring the map? Any other advice?

Thanks in advance. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I just received a new 3DS with Fire Emblem Awakening for father's day. What games are must haves for the system? A few things to keep in mind, I know noone else with a 3DS so multiplayer centric games like Animal Crossing don't interest me that much. I generally have a broad taste in games, but particularly like:

RPGs, roguelikes, strategy games, metroidvanias, and indie games. I have a huge game backlog, so I don't really need recommendations of mediocre games (Castlevania for example - not sure if it is mediocre or not but the reviews didn't look very favorable.)

	<TITLE> YSB: Super House of Dead Ninjas (30% off on steam) </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-02-20 20:18:05 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> This game is a updated version of a free flash game on adultswim.com, just recently released on steam. The basic idea of the game is that you are a badass ninja who starts on floor 350 of a tower and descends to the bottom, fighting enemies and bosses at set levels as you go down. The game is procedurally generated and has permadeath of sorts (5 health that is upgradable, 2 continues), so the replayability of the game is very high.

The game is challenging without feeling impossible. It is similar to Dark Souls in the way of once you learn aspects of the game, you begin to breeze through parts that were once stopping blocks. The game to me plays like an amalgamation of NES Ninja Gaiden, Mega Man X, Super Meat Boy, and Hotline Miami, with lots of bits of other games sprinkled in.

Each kill increases a rage meter, which gives you temporary invincibility when it's filled, but is always going down. This increases your score as well, so you are encouraged to go quickly. If you've played Hotline Miami and know the feeling when you get into the zen state where everything works out, that is this game at its best when you are destroying enemies left and right, jumping over spike pits, and clearing 100+ floors without taking a hit.

Along with being procedurally generated, there are tons of unlocks to strive to get, and they greatly vary the play experience and increase replayability. There are 10+ different unlockable choices for each weapon of your starting loadout - weapon, ranged weapon, bomb, and magic(4 choices for magic). Getting tired of katana/shurikens? Play through with a whip/axe instead for a Castlevania throwback. You also can unlock various things like increased item limits, item pickups, and cosmetic changes. Probably 100 unlocks in all.

The sound in the game is great, and the visuals are crisp and look great even when you're racing through the levels. This is a game I picked up on a whim and I've found to be an absolute gem. At less than 5 bucks right now, it is definitely a steal, highly recommended. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I just picked this game up, and have read a few guides, but there are still a few things I don't understand. I started a new game in Dublin.

One of the first things I did was to create the title of duke of meath once i had the gold. However, I noticed doing so changed my succesion laws from primogeniture to gavelkind, which was annoying as my initial ruler died to illness almost immediately, so I could not change it. Why did the succession laws change?

Secondly, after getting a CB on Kildare, i gathered my armies and attacked. Still not exactly sure how war works. I defeated their main army, and sieged their town. Do I want to press the button that says (paraphrasing) press the attack but risk more casualties? Or do I just sit there and build war score until i get a surrender?

Finally, once i get the surrender, I noticed the guy is still in charge of kildare but it's in my holdings. Should i tax him? Revoke his title? Imprison him? It seemed somewhat counterintuitive to me that the territory i just captured won't be making me any gold. 

Thank you all for taking the time to help me out. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have been out of the standard scene for a while - i quit right before caw blade bannings. I'm looking to put together a standard deck, but I'm pretty unsure what to initially build. I have mostly everything I'd need from before new phyrexia, and could likely trade for the rest.

I'm leaning towards UW delver or a controllish build (UB?), but I figure a lot of you could tell me which decks are tier 1-2, which are on the rise/fall, etc. Thanks! </TEXT>
