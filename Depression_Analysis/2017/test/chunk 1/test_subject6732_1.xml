	<TEXT> They're really worthy.. especially Kindle Paperwhite, which has an inbuilt light as well... Amazon has provided many many classics in Kindle format for free.. That's really something worth mentioning and worth respecting.. It has an AMAZING and flaunty life.. And the best part (although not accurately a moral point) about Kindle is you don't have to really *buy* the books in Kindle editions.. You can just download those ebooks in *.mobi* format from torrents.. I mean, come on, we all download stuff from internet! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In such case, the best part would be to rather talk.. Speak in English with someone who is good at it and ask them to correct you whenever you err. As this goes on, you will not only become good at grammar but also the correctness in grammar will become a part of your sub-conscious; and with this, you will even realize and catch errors (if any) in something that you read or write.. 

When I was learning English language in my school days, we were not allowed to speak in any regional language(I'm from India). So, that is how I learned English, by talking it and correcting it whenever I erred.

Listen to audio books as well.. It will be very helpful!

Good Luck :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I too am an aspiring writer from a country where English is not the official language, India.. Luckily enough, I was able to pursue all my education in English medium all along.. 

Ok, now coming to the *Writing* part. To write a well is an art. And to create art, you ought to be *inspired..*  As you're saying that you're interested in writing, I would suggest you to recognize the kind of writing that inspires you... You should take it from the very basic level..

*Start reading quotes*, lots of quotes from lots of authors.. And I'm sure that will inspire you.. and then alongside, think back into your own past experiences that you feel are vital for your life, and try writing small quotes/sentences about them, whatever they would be, just write a sentence about it. Once you start doing this regularly, you will not only feel like writing more of them, but you will also unconsciously strive to write them more beautifully.. That's how you start recognizing the preciousness of the **art** that you possess.

And once you do that, you will automatically get to know what more to do to improve your style, flow and simplicity in putting the words together.. When you're well into such process, you will eventually build up confidence and you will know what would be the purpose of your writing.

This is what I learned by practicing writing since past 4 years.. I started with writing blogs (began with Blogger, and after all this time, recently switched to Medium.com).. At the begining, my writings had lots of grammatical errors, but after all these years, I'm able to write better, with very less grammatical errors, and above all, with a more inspired spirit in my writing.

*Note*: Read more. Once when you start reading quotes from the books, and when you stumble upon a really really really grand quote or sentence, sit back and think what would've resulted somebody in writing such a sentence.. and then try to read the book which the quote came from... This way you will understand the context behind beautiful words and sentences and believe me, you will desire to create such onces youself.

Even after doing all this, if your skill or ability as a writer doesn't change or advance, tell me, I will give you my address.. you can come and kill me! </TEXT>

Read books... and if you can do that you'll be proud of these two years more than any couple of years in your entire life... and [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/books/) is where you would want to go if you pick up the habit.

For ex: when I type

data(Nile) //I have this 'Nile' dataset in the package

The data present inside it is not being visible. The prompt just goes to next line, and nothing happens. But in online examples they got the data when they typed a datasets name like: data(phones)

Any idea why am I not getting the data? </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> 1984. It is said to be a timeless classic book in English Literature..  I started it some time long ago, nearly more than a month ago and am still not able to finish it. For me it is surely not a page turner. I'm just keeping up with it still because I feel bad when I start a book and decide not to finish it, so am just trying to read it page by page and find out if I can realize why it is such a classic.

There are many instances in the plot that seemed really senseless.. Winston, Julia and O'Brien... there is no proper relation between how they develop their opinions and feelings that they have for one another.. Why Julia loves Winston and a lot more such loose ends..

Can somebody please tell me why this 1984 is a classic?? </TEXT>

I have observed the same plot line in very well known classics Fahrenheit 451, 1984, and also a novella Anthem (by Ayn Rand)... 

Now, why is that??  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> 100 Day Declaration: Addiction is not at all an evil </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-06-26 19:10:30 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Ive finished 100 days of abstinence and there is a specific viewpoint of mine that I want to portray today to the members of this brotherhood about the subject at hand, *the addiction.*

Along this time, Ive only, or at least mostly, seen people referring to masturbation as a completely negative thing in their lives and it ruining their vital time. People say its a demon that stops ones development in life and so should be killed. *I dont agree.* It should not be ended; it should rather be fought and conquered but never despised and killed, never; because the real meaning of victory is not killing but conquering. After all, what would we, the powerful Humans, the soldiers who man the eternal Universe residing within each of us, do if there is no worthy opponent, if there is nothing standing between us and the ambitions we carry in our hearts? You can trek to the heights and watch the horizons only when there are mountains present in your way and blocking the view. So, I say your addiction (to masturbation or anything else) is not a prison that locks you up but a gym that strengthens you; and of course strength is only enjoyable when it is tested, not when it is rested. So it tests you, it weakens you, it hits you in the face, it hits you in the heart, it provokes you to fight back, and in the process it makes you stronger, it makes you brave, it makes you familiar to the hurdles again and again in the form of ups and downs, crests and troughs, so that when you encounter greater ones ahead in your life, you dont fear them anymore. Addiction can be an ocean of pleasure; you either learn to swim it and enjoy the dive, or fall straight in and drown away into its depth; choice is yours; and in both the above cases, ocean is not to the blame. A gymnasium is presented to you but working out in there is solely your duty. Don't offend your addictions, overrun them.

After 100 days of staying away from PMO, especially masturbation, this is all Ive realized about it. I wont hate it, I cant hate it; because it gave me intense pleasure since my puberty and I cant deny that. So, I stopped seeing it as an enemy, I never saw it as an enemy, I only saw it as a competitor, as an opponent, who irks me to dare win against it. 

I started my abstinence not at all because I was an addict of masturbation, but because its very valuable and enjoyable to me and I wanted to sacrifice such blissful pleasure for a goal that I took up in my life, like leaving the joy and comfort of home and going to the war to achieve my goal. That day was the start, and today it is 100 days; and this is just the beginning. 

*Thank you all, for your unstopping support to many brothers like me here, justifying the name, a brotherhood!* </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Recently there was a conservation going on with my friend about porn and masturbation and I mentioned to him that I took break from all those things. 

Friend: Why don't you masturbate?

Me: Just like that, took a break for a while.

Friend: Whatever happens won't you masturbate?

Me: No. I won't.

Friend: What if a very sexy girl comes to you? You won't fuck her? 

Me: No.

Friend: Won't you even masturbate thinking about her?

Me: No.

Friend: Why? Don't you have a dick??

Me: *I do. And I also have dignity in my dick.*

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I've always had this doubt inside my mind and now I started watching Carl Sagan's **Cosmos** hence this rose again in me. Now I can't stop asking this to the world, once and for all:

When we talk about the Cosmic entities such Planets, Solar Systems, Stars, Galaxies and etc, we talk in light years.. We, the human beings never even have set foot on the farthest planet even in our own solar system, but we diligently talk of numerous Galaxies apart from our own as if we have a crystal clear knowledge of them. 

When we haven't been to any of the other planets or to any farther than our own solar system, how the hell can we say that we are this much far this this galaxy and that much far from that galaxy??

 Not just that, anything and everything that is being told about the cosmic universe by our science, how can we be so sure about it all?? For example, in the Cosmos TV Series, *Ryan Nebula* is said to be **ONLY** 1500 Light Years away from Earth.. How on earth can we even envision, sitting here on this planet, about something that requires one to travel for 1500 years at the speed of light?? 

How in the world do we know all these things? I beg for the answers!!

	<TEXT> I love to read books.. and then one day, just like that, I also discovered erotica (erotic stories) and started to love the kinky ones..!! I would even go further and say that I was once addicted to them than to the actual porn.. 

Now, I'm into NoFapping.. I'm on my 70+ days without fapping. But recently, as I started exploring Reddit, I found those subreddits that are very closely related to the kind of erotica I used to read.. and was kinda into them for a couple of days on the weekend.. I broswed through lot of captioned pictures on reddit and some real life stories...

I realized this is wrong too and am again trying to keep myself away from them like I did when started NoFapping a couple of months ago, although I didn't reset my badge right now because I **did not** masturbate at all!!

So, plz tell me does reading erotica, watching related captioned pictures and feeling aroused comes under Porn?? </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I very recently bought 'Mein Kampf' by Adolf Hitler, published by Wilco Classics. It was a leather bound edition for a very less price, for just Rs.275 (less than $6). I was impressed by the hard binding, quality of the paper and the print. Out of curiosity I then browsed for other books from Wilco. Fortunately, I found lot of other books, all leather bound/hard cover editions and at prices even lesser than the one I mentioned above.

But to my surprise, none of the books are rated/reviewed (in Amazon). This made me wonder whether these books from Wilco Classic Library are of people's interest or not.

What do you people think of them?? Are there any particular disadvantages if one collects Wilco Classic editions?? </TEXT>
