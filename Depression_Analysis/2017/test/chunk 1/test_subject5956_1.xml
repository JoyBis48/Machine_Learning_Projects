	<TEXT> This is a good idea. I am lvl 30 with 500 something wins(not saying that is good). I have only played 3 ranked games, and I was invited to those games not knowing it was ranked(duo queue). I'm not saying you should be able to make your own avatars but if they did add it in, they should maybe have ranked games be a part of it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Fiora? Underpowered? I think she can do massive damage and has a pretty low cooldown counter ability. I mean sure you can build armor to make her do less damage (as you can with other melee carries) but I would never call her underpowered. She doesn't need a nerf though, imo. </TEXT>
