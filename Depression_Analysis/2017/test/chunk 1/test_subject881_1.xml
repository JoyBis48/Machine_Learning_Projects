	<TEXT> It isn't. Commercially available solar cells have an efficiency of 17 to 20 percent, so there is only one fifth of the energy going into electricity. This is even under laboratory conditions. Rawlemon indicates they already be able to achieve an efficiency of more than 50 percent with the glass ball collectors right now. On a squarefoot photovoltaic surface, the prototypes already produces as much electricity as conventional systems generate with a much bigger surface - they are four times as effective.

Lighted pictures of a redhead, plasticoated hot on

The smile of disbelief 

Stained signature of nightmares 

They're stolen by the thief 

I'm back on the borderline 

Yes I'm back on the borderline
