	<TEXT> Thank you for doing this AMA. You might like this little Christmas story.

About 10 years ago about this time of year, I was visiting my mother in New York City. In December, tree vendors drive to the city from New England and other places, each with a truck full of trees, and set up shop at curbsides all over the city, selling their trees till they run out. 

My mother has a small apartment and doesn't normally get a tree. One day I was walking past a tree seller and saw that he had taken some little branches about a foot or so long that had fallen from the larger trees, stuck each one into a piece of wood for a base, and put them next to a sign that said "Charlie Brown trees, $3." Naturally I couldn't resist, so I bought one and took it home, and my mother loved it. It stayed healthy-looking through the holidays. 

So thanks to you and your husband for this and other additions to our culture. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Other good massage oils, besides coconut, are sweet almond oil and (my favorite) grapeseed oil. The expensive massage oils at the store are just something mundane like almond oil with some blend of scents; it's easy to duplicate at home for a fraction of the cost. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 50 here. I figured out early on that I lack the patience for having kids, and never really felt the urge. I like that I can make decisions that affect only me -- I've made good and bad, but the bad ones only hurt myself. No regrets. These are my priorities and mine alone; if yours are different, I'm behind you 100%. I'm happy to leave the child-rearing to people who want to do it and are reasonably good at it. </TEXT>
