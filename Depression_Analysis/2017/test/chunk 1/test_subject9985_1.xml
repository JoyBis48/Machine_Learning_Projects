	<TEXT> Yeah I think it was captioned something like that but I thought it just seemed a bit random in comparison to the rest of the documentary. Wasn't sure if it was actually a younger family member or something.

Still, wish I was taken under Jack White's wing when I was that age!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> After watching "it might get loud" last night and watching Jimmy Page, Edge and Jack White do an awesome bit of slide improv I headed straight out today to get a slide.

Anybody got any good song recommendations for me to learn? And perhaps more importantly are there any drills I should practice with it? </TEXT>
