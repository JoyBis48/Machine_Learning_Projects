	<TITLE> Has an urban legend ever affected you or the things you do? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> I know it's stupid, but [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Licked_Hand) has changed the way I live my life (albeit in a very small way).
      

At night, my cat always props up on the side of the bed to bump his head against/lick my hand before jumping on the bed.  Ever since I became aware of this stupid legend, I have to turn on my phone's flashlight and shine it in his face before I am at ease.      

  
Not the way a 33-year-old, grown-ass man should be...but we all have our things, right?  Right?! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've read a version of that before somewhere and let me tell you...I fucking hate it!  
  
Whenever my wife calls me from downstairs and I'm halfway down, that little thought pops into my head for some reason.  If I went towards her voice in the kitchen and then I heard her calling me from one of the upstairs rooms...I would probably shit myself right there. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> ...within a ten minute window.

First one was 70 in a 45 on a highway. Got a ticket for that. In the same stop, I got a written warning about my expired tag and a verbal warning about my tinted windows. Gave him a "Thank you sir." and I was on my way home.

Second one was 83 in a 60 on the interstate. Got a verbal warning for that. Here's the kick...I also got a ticket for my expired tag and one for my tinted windows. I was contemplating on saying "Thank you sir, may I have another?", but I realized that would not end well for me.

Needless to say, my driving habits will be changing...along with my insurance premiums. </TEXT>

Another was a single player tip to invest in the companies that Lester talks about before doing the assassinations...which I haven't done any of them yet.

And another was:
1. Make two character profiles.
2. Have one be like an "off shore" bank account.
3. Whatever money you earn with your main character, put into the bank.
4. Switch to the other character and have him withdraw it all into pocket cash.
5. Switch back to the main character, and if someone kills you, the "medical bill" doesn't get taken out of your bank account. </TEXT>

I'm the GTA V version of Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman...without the blowjobs and ALMOST getting raped by George Costanza.  </TEXT>

I could be wrong, though.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> After a survival mission, I got placed into a random session. With only me and another person in this session, I felt somewhat safe to go about my business (robbing stores, shooting random NPCs, taking pictures of bikini clad women on the beach).

Out of the blue, this guy sends me a text saying that we should team up. Being the paranoid person that this game has turned me into...I accept, but have my pistol out just in case. He rumbles up to my location in a fully modded Z Type. Seeing as I barely have $9K in the bank and haven't seen that car in game anywhere before...I was impressed.

He then proceeds to friend me, let me in his car, and then takes me to his $400K apartment. I felt like Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman...only, you know...if Julia Roberts was a dude. Anyway, we get to his apartment and go into the garage, where he proceeds to show me his impressive array of whips, all modded out as well. We then spend the next 10-20 minutes, standing there just talking money strategies and general gameplay tactics. He told me a bunch of things that I didn't know and even offered to give me cash, but couldn't because the option was grayed out at the time being.

At the end of our rendezvous, he says he's going to go play CoD and to hit him up later for some general GTA fun. Right before he leaves he says, "Most people with a bounty on their head wouldn't be as trusting as you were.". At that point, I just remembered that I jacked an NPCs ride before the previous survival mission and he put a $5K bounty on my head. I had totally forgotten about it.

That was the absolute coolest experience that I've had with a random person in GTA:O! This game is awesome! </TEXT>
