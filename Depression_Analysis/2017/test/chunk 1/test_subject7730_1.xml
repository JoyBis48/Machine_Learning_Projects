	<TEXT> Not necessarily, if you eat more then you have to get rid of the waste products that you're body doesn't use and if you eat more then you are bound to have to poop more. So technically, a thinner person can poop more but on average the bigger person will expell more fecal matter. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not an expert, just a 16 y/o hiphop music producer, and I use samples a TON, but I think the situation varies on who you are sampling. If you can get into contact with the creator of the sample source, he/she can give you permission to use the sample for free or they might charge you/want a cut for the use of their artistry. If you're releasing this for monetary gains, usually the label would take care of sample clearance but I'm not sure if thats possibility in your situation or not. </TEXT>
