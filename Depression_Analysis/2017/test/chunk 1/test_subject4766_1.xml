	<TEXT> I personally will always go with the i7 model as the extra threads for work will come in handy. If you're just playing games then an i5 will be alright but youll find a few years down the line the i5 will begin to bottle neck when compared to the highest i7 at the time because of the extra threads. In some cases there is usually only a $50 difference between an i5 and i7 which is another reason i go for an i7.

	<TEXT> I agree and disagree. The way light sabers were used in the prequels was definitely one of the few positives in my books. That final duel between Obiwan and Anakin was incredible, it was just so beautifully choreographed it was like watching a well performed ballet. But i also agree that the duel between vader and luke in empire strikes back was amazing to. It all comes down to whether or not you prefer the prequels or original trilogy and clearly your a fan of the original trilogy and i can respect that. I seem to be one of the few fans who like both trilogies.  </TEXT>

what do you guys think of this new xbox app for windows 10? is it a steam like app or just more DRM? i noticed on the bottom left there is a store icon. How cool would it be if we could purchase and play xbox games on pc? it would be a step in the right direction on microsofts part to make a unified experience which is what they hinted at a while ago with that windows 10 announcement that showed a pc, xbox one, tablet etc all lined up against each other. What do you guys think. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> But this time have him direct it instead of Blomkamp. Surely Microsoft knows they have a good thing going here with Halo and that people actually want to see this made! the short films Blomkamp did for the halo 3 advertising campaign were amazing so if they could still get Blomkamp involved as producer along side Jackson it would be perfect. If you dont know what im talking about check this out.

	<TEXT> Lets take the hobbit for example, i see nothing wrong with it. ive enjoyed it right from the start and i love what peter jackson has done with middle earth and yet people still complain about silly arguments like too much CGI or he ruined the movie by adding stuff that wasn't in the book. but its not just the hobbit where im seeing this. 

The new star wars trailer for instance everyone is complaining about something whether it be the damn light saber or the lense flare near the millennium falcon or the CG in the teaser, yes ive seen people complain about that to. UGH. what is it with people and why cant we just enjoy what we have been given am I missing something here? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What type of stories would you like to see made in to movies? The obvious one would be an origin of gollum movie since we only catch a glimpse of it in return of the king and hear little tid bits of it through dialog, i think gollum is interesting enough to carry his own movie. Also one issue i can see being a problem is what would be the end game for a MECU? since LOTR is essentially the end any movies would have to take place prior to LOTR. Unless they came up with their own stories on what happens after LOTR but I cant really see what working well. Any ideas? </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> If your a gamer then youll know 2014 has been kind of shit for gaming at least imo. So many big titles have been delayed till next year which got me wondering. Why dont we hear about movies getting delayed as much as games? I mean sure we had the amazing spiderman 3 delayed this year to 2018 and as far as i know thats the only one this year. Though to be fair i dont keep up with movie news as much as i do video game news so I may be wrong on that part but if someone could enlighten me as to why movie delays dont seem to be as common id be interested to hear the reason behind it.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I sated in the other thread that I thought the dark knight was the boring one of the trilogy mostly because of the dry Harvey Dent plot with all the politics while begins and rises are great action films the dark knight seemed more like a political spy thriller rather than a straight up action movie like the other 2 and may have been why i found it boring. Anyone else agree? </TEXT>
