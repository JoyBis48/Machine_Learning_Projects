	<TEXT> Lock your door like everyone says and hope he isn't in there with you. Definitely call the police AND let someone close to you know what's going on, a friend or a parent, etc. The likelihood is that this is someone you know what messing with you, hence the Lulu. But it would be stupid to take any chances.

tl;dr hide and call the fucking police asap </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Straight up man you need to call a priest or an exorcist or a ghidt hunter something along those lines. If your parents don't believe you there are two options: 1) Explain the whole ordeal to your parents WITH your siblings and say all you want is to call a priest etc to ease the nervousness. 2) do olit behind their backs when they aren't home or something.

Either way you have to do it.
Good luck OP. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Definitely anything by Christopher. Nympho is especially good.

Also, can someone make this playlist on a different service like 8tracks as Spotify isn't available in every country? :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I just got Aviate and I have 5 invites for anyone who wants them. Just shoot me a PM or comment your email! All I ask is you return the favor for any other redditors who need it. Maybe we could start a bit of a chain? 

P.S. Aviate is great, I highly recommend it! If you're sort of on the fence about getting it or not, I suggest trying it out for a few days, it really helps to have everything laid out as simply as it is. Good luck new Aviators! </TEXT>
