	<TEXT> Don't tell me you're  16 year old, because if you were then I'd  get angry. A day old infant isn't depressed. You probably fell from grace around 7 years old. So if you are 16, you had angst for about 9 years. It will go away if you change your attitude about life - irony. Good luck.  </TEXT>

I don't expect you to teach me anything, I'm already studying the language. I want to send gifts and receive gifts ( small items, but it's the thought that counts) I just want to make more Japanese friends. I plan on working in Japan after I graduate so I want to start now. You can either email me or snail mail me. my email is drummergeorge@aol.com   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Vist /r/SuicideWatch if anything goes atrwy. I can answer your question, OP. I live life for romance. Everything I do in life is for the sake of love. To me happiness is being healthy and seeing a beautiful asain girl, I approach her flirt with her, let her know I want to bang the shit out of her and hopefully  not get rejected. I will always do things for love. e.x Work - love - better production 
 School - love - great time, fun memories. Home - love - cook, Clean house
 I'm just in love with life. Oh as an aspiring psychologost, I highly  recommend you find love- whether platonic or promiscuous, you need love as an individual  in order to feel like living. If you're really desperate try an escort services and after the first experience  you'll fathom. Best of luck! (also worst come to shove, please be an organ donor)  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah,  my closest ones from 3rd grade. Out of all of us,  I  only went to university, one went to college and the other two didn't. They have no ambition, stay at home all day. I started seeing the gap several weeks ago, but I was in denial. I realized it yesterday  when I invited them to a party at my school, I drank a little but my friends were total losers. They didn't  want to do anything.  I wanted to approach women and I did- got rejected, twice- but they didn't want to do shit besides go home. Killed my buzz. Also, it was a built up from that, always telling me about "my debt" that I'm stupid for doing  all these awesome things. I work as a tutor as of now, I go to the gym, just cardio but am going to start lifting soon. I'm an audiophile, I spend 300+ on headphones, currently saving 1k to upgrade my car speakers. Love electronic/ambient music. I don't watch TV, I abhor the laugh track, makes me furious. The TV producer tells me I'm so stupid I don't know when to laugh, what a moron. Other interests? hmmm.. I love romance a lot. I dedicated my whole life to it( platonic or promiscuous ) I love helping people, that's why I'm going into therapy.  I volunteer at a orphanage to "save the children".As far as talking to people at school, I got rejected  four times last week, so now I'm here. See, i go for the 8s and 9s, those babys are hard to crack. I got a few after me, but I know my worth. Trying to bounce back though . I do meet people at my school, but I think reddit will just falciiate  my social circle ten fold. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  But I don't want to be manipulative or anything

You're associating manipulation from a negative cognition. But did you know a positive connotation is referred to as: persuasion? People use each other all the time, for good or bad. Relationships are exactly that. Men get the sex, woman get the security form it. It's a give and take. (This might not make sense, depends on your level of apprehension) 

Honestly, I don't think you would be able to handle it. You need to be angry or uncomfortable. Then you have passion to change. I got a [picture](http://i.imgur.com/PrXxF5k.jpg) for you OP. I can go on and on about the subject, but I just want to plant the seed and hopefully one day you'll transpire from it. Good luck!

	<TEXT> I came up a with an analogy for you OP. Consider woman dogs. When you're little they all look strange and interesting. You want to touch them. When you have the courage to do so, some will be pleased with your touch and one day one will bite you. Now it may be an ER visit type or just a small bandage. You've been bitten OP. And you're in psychological pain. But that's the worst one. There is plenty of material on the internet to spot dogs (woman) and how to get them to wag their tail in your presence, but it's hard to find what works for you.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I went through something similar to what you went through OP, not as drastic but just as traumatic. When I was 17 I got hit by a car. I broke my neck-C-7- If it was one bone down-C-6- I would have been a quadriplegic. My mom wanted to go to court to sue the driver. But I couldn't. I told her if she did I wanted nothing to do with it. It was a moment of time where I didn't want to relive. I had my neck broken for fucks sake. I had to wear a neck brace for 3 months. Can you imagine being in high school for that duration? My friends were awesome about it, making fun of me- I liked it, it made it less threatening- but I still got looks and empathy from people. I just wanted it all to go away. I still keep the torn helmet from the crash to remind myself that life goes on. I'm not sure how old you are, but no one can force you to do anything, in the US-long as you're not incriminated. You can tell your therapist to eat shit, you're not talking. Sure, maybe the cops will be involved but so what? Plea the 5th. You don't have to say shit, if you don't want to. But don't repress that memory or else it will manifest from within. I was at peace with the accident, and so should you. Let it go, there is nothing you can do about it now. Just accept it happened and move on with your life. You're not going in that direction why look there? Keep moving forward. Good luck.  </TEXT>
