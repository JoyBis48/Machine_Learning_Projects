	<TEXT> It sounds like someone who isn't into bisexual girls. I mean take what you want from it, but it's me. My profile said something similar to "I'm intimidated by bisexual girls." I got rid of it, but I never once said I'm not scared of anyone who has had homosexual relationships. Me saying I'm intimidated is my way of saying I would be nervous to be with a girl who has been with other girls. If you want to be uptight and get offended by this then so be it. Saying that just because I have my profile set to straight girls only is a sign I may have other "illogical beliefs" is the most ridiculous thing I've heard in a while. Why don't you bring this up with okcupid who has that setting allowed? Do something constructive with how you feel instead of targeting one person. That's the problem with a lot of people these days. So many would rather harass someone over something silly than actually do something about it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Nothing, honestly. It's just I don't know how I would feel dating a bisexual girl. It certainly isn't homophobic, but if you feel like it is then that's fine.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So I notice that a lot of girls say don't send me a message saying just "Hey", give it some effort. Every single first message I have received from a girl has been a simple "Hey" or a variation of hey such as "Hey cutie" or "Hi". What's up with this double standard? Why can girls say hey, but males get shunned for saying hey? </TEXT>

I'll still chat people up during these months, but I'll take it slow and just keep my options open. Don't totally become a hermit. Just be that neighbor who talks about the weather when you're both picking up your newspaper.  </TEXT>
