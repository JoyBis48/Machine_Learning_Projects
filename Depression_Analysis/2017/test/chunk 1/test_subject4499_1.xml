	<TITLE> FIRST "OPIATE" PRIZE WINNER? </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> [Blair posted this blurb today.](http://www.toolband.com/index_frames.html)


**FIRST "OPIATE" PRIZE WINNER?**

**It would appear that some lucky individual has won the first 'golden ticket' ("SEAL OF XATANITOS"), that was included in one of the first hundred or so 21st anniversary OPIATE CD packages that have been shipped out. From what I've been told, the winning 'seal' was inserted into the variation colored grayish-silver. Once I get all the details from Merch, I will post the name of the winner along with his or her photo.**


Looks like we'll find out what those seals are pretty soon.

EDIT: the greyish-silver is the [second variation](http://imgur.com/a/uSWpI) from what I can see. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So I went to see one of my all time favorites tonight, Animals As Leaders, during their supporting show for Meshuggah here in Calgary, Alberta. Grabbed my tickets, got inside and got a beer. As the guy poured my beer he commented on what was supposed to be tonight's short concert. Asking why, he explained that Tosin of AAL tried to break up a fight in Boston between a cop and a rowdy concert goer, that turned out to be an obstruction of justice charge apparently. I couldn't fucking believe it.
So pissed I sold my tickets and left like a sulking baby. So heads up for anyone else anticipating an upcoming Animals As Leaders show in Canada.

**tl;dr** Animals As Leaders forbidden to travel internationally for the time being.

Edit: It was Javier Reyes, and not Tosin Abasi. Thanks Triangular_Desire. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So I'm looking for a picture of [Jamie Foxx](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-aK8sF75Y5xE/UMYD0U80luI/AAAAAAAAK_Q/vFkeZOqDNis/s1600/jamie-foxx-surreal4real-charity-event-02.jpg) colored white (kind of like the Wayans brothers from the terrible movie [white chicks](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0381707/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1)) and dressed up as Dexter doing something [Dexter](http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Arts/Arts_/Pictures/2008/09/09/dexter460.jpg) would do. Can anybody help? It doesn't have to include the pictures I've linked.

EDIT: I promise not to repost it to /r/dexter as my own work. I legitimately want to get my friend going.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Tool Pictures August 5th, 2009 Toronto Ontario </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2012-12-23 02:55:12 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I flew through Toronto to catch a Tool show on my way back from vacation in 2009. I was seated next to another dude flying solo at the show, he ended up taking a bunch of pictures, I asked him to email them to me and he came through, stand up fellow. [Thought I'd share.](http://imgur.com/a/sLvvN) 

It was your [standard 10000 Days setlist](http://toolnavy.com/showthread.php?t=114069). Also, [this](http://i.imgur.com/St1as.jpg) is the poster from the show, might be my favorite from the three I have.

Yeah some of them are blurry, but there are a few nice one's in there. Unfortunately this is the best resolution I have.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Am I the only one that thinks halo 4 multiplayer is vastly similar the Call of Duty series? I was never a fan of those games for many reasons, 1) Unfair advantages among players due to tactical load outs 2) Point count for wins 3) Weapon markers 4) Ordinance. This game may look/play nice but it's so far from halo that I find myself quite turned off, I miss that level playing field we all once had, where the good gained advantage with knowledge. Anyways just my two cents. Just curious if I am alone on this. Oh I forgot to mention the sounds, every standard halo noise is basically gone. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Please help, my elderly mother was a victim of a break and entering in Grand Falls Windsor! </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2012-10-10 00:39:04 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hey everyone, I'm at a loss as to where I'm supposed to turn next so I thought I would try r/newfoundland. My wonderful mother 74 years of age was a victim of robbery this past week. She has never been an overly wealthy woman, using what little wealth she has to support her very large family. Her house is small and quaint and doesn't contain many valuables (her television is tubed and her stereo is 15 plus years old, among the rest of her things that were left behind by the thieves). She has always been content with her humbled life and the only valuables she's ever really had came in the form of a few small rings passed down through the generations of our family. These rings of course hold no real monetary value (very small weight in gold), but the sentiments they hold in my mothers heart are unmatched. 

I know this is such a long shot but if anyone has seen or heard anything in regards to breaking and entering and the sale of used jewelry on the streets in the Grand Falls area, could you please let me or the police know. It would mean so much to her to actually retrieve these small items and/or see the culprits brought to justice.

I completely understand that there are problems in our society, and that drug addiction among other things, can bring people to carry out the unspeakable, but it breaks my heart knowing that there are those who prey on the elderly. It's about time these actions are taken seriously by the system, and the law works in favor of the victims.

If by some even slimmer chance someone who was directly involved manages to read this, if you somehow still have my mothers jewelry and have it in you to return it, I will most certainly not pursue this any further, I would walk away knowing that all hope isn't lost. I would forgive you personally, and I will hold that gesture in such high regard for the rest of my time on this earth. I do not wish to seek revenge, but to make things right.

If you think you might know something and require further description please PM me.

Thank you for your time. </TEXT>
