	<TITLE> Helping killing Crawmerax (BL1 PC) </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-02-25 02:42:20 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I decided to get back into BL1 recently and have decided to get all the achievements, just for fun, however my lvl 61 roland save file seems to be corrupt or something, long story short, i leveled a siren, im now level 50 and have lost the will to live.

 However to get the achievement for killing Craw im gonna need to be level 61 or have someone carry me, so i was wondering if there are any kind souls out there willing to carry a level 50 noob to help me get the achievement? :P

	<TEXT> i'd rather no teleporting at all, and you have to ride your mount everywhere and face the challenges a long the way, it'd make the game longer and more challenging as well as adding to the RPG elements of the game and taking less away from the immersion  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Mounts! Instead of the old catch a ride system i feel the ability to mount up at any time just like you can in WoW would be really awesome.

I feel like mounts like these could fit really well into the game and it offers more charater custimization if you give the player access to rare mount skins or just rare mounts etc.
