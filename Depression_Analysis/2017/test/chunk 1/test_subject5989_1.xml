	<TEXT> Hey guys, I love Rust. Primarily base building. However I'm not too great at making something that looks awesome. Anyone care to share what theirs looks like? Or know of any sites that show how to guides etc for sweet base layouts? Thanks :P </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When you go to multiplayer do you simply type in Altis life or you need a specific server address to type in which then downloads the appropriate files? I've been waiting to get this for like 6 months I'm praying its on sale today! lol </TEXT>
