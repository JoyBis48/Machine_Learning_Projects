	<TEXT> A zealot hero would be my first choice as a starcraft warrior, but I think there are numerous other possibilities. Ultralisks, roaches, and immortals come immediately to mind. A marauder might also be interesting as a hybrid warrior/assassin. Kind of like Sonya, but instead of getting right into the fray, it'd be more focused on zoning enemies out.

The firebat idea is a cool one, I wouldn't have thought of that. </TEXT>

You've used the phrase "toxic lunatics". Read your comment history, and tell me, honestly, that you wouldn't call somebody who behaves as you do "toxic". Your last 10 comments are extremely hostile and negative. I stopped counting after that, but I'm guessing that this is pretty much your MO.

I mean this seriously, I really think you should do a self evaluation, because your behavior suggests that you've got some serious anger problems that need to be addressed. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Patch day is normally the second Tuesday.

According to whom? Just because that's when they usually do it, doesn't mean that it's late if they don't. They never said the patch would be two weeks ago. They said it would be early this week, and it was. You need to adjust your expectations, not to mention your sense of entitlement.

If what you meant is that, then you are thanking them for completing their scheduled B.Net maintenance at the time they promised.

I am thanking them for completing the patch at the time that they promised, because that's something that I want to encourage.

Imagine you're Blizzard, and if, like you, everyone were to complain whether you complete the work late or on time, you've got little motivation to be on time.

Truth be told, my post probably doesn't have any meaningful impact on whether they're late or on time in the future, but they were on time yesterday, I appreciated it, and it only took 30 seconds to say so. So I said so. I wouldn't really call that "hero worship", but if you'd like to, by all means. </TEXT>

But yeah, I agree, accidental mini-map clicking is something they absolutely need to fix. It's definitely gotten me killed more than a few times. </TEXT>

If this makes you mad, and it should, consider the impact that all of this hopeless desperation has on crime (spoiler alert: it's not going to go down).

Then take a moment and connect the dots: increasing financial burden on the poor, lowering taxes for the rich, and privatizing everything. Where does that lead you?

	<TEXT> He's a lot of fun, but he needs a different trait. The current one is practically non-existent. He's a tank, so he doesn't die a lot (more often than not I'll end a game with zero deaths), it's super easy to avoid the explosion, and even if it hits, the chances of it having a meaningful impact are pretty low.

I'd much rather him have a trait that will help me avoid dying. Given the fact that he's not the tankiest tank, and doesn't put out very much damage, I think giving him a useful trait would put him closer to balanced. </TEXT>

What's your point?

"Drug dealers don't ID," and they won't when it's legal (they will still sell pot to youngsters).

Sure, but there will be a lot less illegal pot, especially as more and more states and countries legalize. You don't see kids buying bathtub gin or black market cigarettes. </TEXT>

I hate this so much, and it transcends support. Countless times I've put myself at risk or pop a valuable CD to buy a doomed teammate a small window of escape, but they read it as "reinforcements have arrived, let's do this thing!" and turn around to re-engage the 3+ enemies chasing them.

The end result is always the same: they die immediately and now I'm in the hopeless situation that they were in.

	<TEXT> If it was as tight and polished as Hearthstone and had something akin to the arena to hold my interest (and let me build up my collection without financial investment), I'd consider it.

Honestly, I'd probably still be playing Solforge if it was as well done as Hearthstone. I thought that game was super compelling, but the actual user experience was very lacking.

I'd play those other games in addition to, not in place of, Hearthstone, though. Hearthstone is awesome. </TEXT>

1. Don't fight pointlessly, especially in the beginning.
2. Experience is extremely important, don't leave a lane empty unless there's a very good reason.
3. If your team is down a person, avoid a fight. If their team is down a person, pick a fight (or try for an objective/mercs).

Good luck and have fun! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> this stuff takes time

No, it takes competition. The US pays more for slower and lower quality internet access than most of the developed world, and it's entirely because ISPs have a monopolistic hold on their industry. They have no incentive to do better, because we have no choice.

We're lucky to have even two options in Cincinnati (though that only gets us so far), most people only have one, but Google coming to town would not only give us the option of working with a good provider, and also force the bad (Cincinnati Bell) and terrible (Time Warner) providers to do better. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I do agree, we are lucky to have a choice (most people don't), and it's nice that some people in the area can get gigabit speed (though sadly I'm not one of them).

That said, Cincinnati Bell's not that much better than Time Warner in terms of customer service/relations, so it would be nice to have a good company like Google come in and raise the bar for customer experience, service, pricing, etc.. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Three things to consider:

1. Cincinnati Bell's gigabit service isn't available everywhere. It's certainly not available to me, or I'd be using it. I'm not sure that they offer fiber everywhere yet, either.
2. Competition will force Bell and Time Warner to do better. There's a reason Time Warner and Comcast are among the worst companies in America, and that's the monopoly that they have on their industry. We're lucky to have a second option, though Cincinnati Bell doesn't raise the bar very much. Google most definitely will.
3. Cincinnati Bell's customer service sucks. It's not as bad as Time Warner's, but it's pretty bad. I can't speak to Google's customer service, but they have a reputation for doing things right and for not trying to do everything as cheaply as possible.

3 is the biggest factor as far as I'm concerned. It would be nice to have a faster connection, but the thing I hate the most about our situation is having to choose between Cincinnati Bell (bad) or Time Warner (incredibly bad, and only going to get worse when they've merged with Comcast) and dreading every interaction that I have with them. </TEXT>

It's basically RCV with multiple seats, which pretty much eliminates the problem of gerrymandering, as well as provides better (proportional, if you will) representation. STV is definitely better, but not every seat can be made into multiple seats (mayors, governors, treasurers, the president, etc.), and where we can't, RCV is the way to go.

Here are videos describing each system:

Sadly, she only changed her mind when faced with a *personal* reason (her son's medicinal needs for marijuana). The good reasons for legalization have always been there.

I agree with your message, and I certainly applaud this woman for recognizing her mistake and trying to right it, but I don't think she's exactly a role model for open-mindedness. I'm fairly certain she would still be opposing it if she hadn't had that personal experience, like the many conservatives that oppose gay marriage until a member of their family comes out. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Just not sure why people want to put another poison in their body

You say "another", but the thing is, marijuana is already ubiquitous. Kids often choose weed because it's easier to get than beer. If prohibition worked that would be one thing, but all it does is funnel money to drug dealers, gangs, and ultra violent cartels, instead of into the economy and into the hands of tax payers. It's entirely counterproductive.

And not only is there a ton of weed out there, it's all entirely unregulated. I know a guy that unknowingly smoked some laced with formaldehyde and it really messed him up.

Furthermore, it's rather senseless to prohibit marijuana and not alcohol and tobacco, when the first is far less dangerous (if dangerous at all) than the other two.

I should point out that I've never tried marijuana, and have no plans to even once it's legal, but I push hard for legalization because it would be a really beneficial thing for the country. I agree there are higher priority issues, but prohibition causes some very significant problems (and really doesn't prevent any), so it shouldn't be on the bottom of the list either. The political will is there, and it's something most people agree upon, so let's do it.

**TL;DR** - Keeping marijuana illegal causes some major problems, serves almost no purpose, and is easily corrected, so let's solve the issues we can while we work on the others. </TEXT>

I know! It's so sad, because when I saw it I was like "huh, so that's where Uraguay is." *hangs head in shame*

Most of the last season [is on YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3XTzVzaHQEd30rQbuvCtTQ), if you want to get caught up. I highly recommend [the episode on Scottish Independence](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YkLPxQp_y0). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's where I'm at. I've never used marijuana, and don't intend to even after legalization, but legalization is very important, and if we can get this passed in 2016, it gets us most of what a good legalization bill would, and we can correct it from there.

I know people hate this proposal, and I'd rather see something better passed, too, but I'll take "mostly legal" over "pointlessly  and counter-productively illegal" if that's what we can get. </TEXT>
