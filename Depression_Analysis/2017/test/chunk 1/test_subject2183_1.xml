You: i tried to develop a strategy

You: neurons are strengthened better if pleasure pain or emotions are 
involved


You: right?

You: so what i figured was, what if i stop all the stimulation

You: and let myself get bored

You: no tv shows

You: no junk food

You: no slouching sitting up straight

You: no procrastinating focusing

You: and i stuck to it

You: it ended badly

You: i got depressed

You: anxious

You: but when i did stimulate myself

You: via "fun"

You: i felt better

You: but i feel like having too much fun is bad

You: as it can be a distraction

You: and can make one dependent on "fun"

You: it can make them addicted as well

You: which will be harder to quit

	<TITLE> Thoughts on self improvement and nietzsche? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-11-11 11:29:39 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> After fully understanding nietzsche i have discovered just how flawed the society around me and myself are. I found all my delusions, rationalisations, false interests, escapism all of it and it does feel terrible but I am willing to improve myself bit by bit. When exposing the overwhelming amount of flaws my mind kept on switching between giving up with a sense of nihilism (it's all going to end anyway so just live life and let it go) to the will to life and the will to power (Life happens once, be completely honest in every moment) the eternal recurrence started spawning ideas in my head, If I were to repeat this life with the lack of meaning and delusions for eternity how unfulfilling would it be? Though if there were times when I stood up and acted against delusions and become brave and powerful, then a repeating life may be worth it just for the moments of greatness. Where to begin though? When my mind is solving a problem I just ask myself, is this the most important thing I could be thinking about right now? am I spending my days truly improving my life or am I just wasting it because of escapism and more delusions? Is the question "Am i doing/thinking the most important thing in my life?" a question worth asking, is it an important question? what if it is a result of a delusion? There are so many variables that my whole life is making me feel lost and powerless but the will to life still remains </TEXT>

Right now as your eyes read the words I am typing, you exist and if you are honest enough with yourself, the journey to self improvement is the best journey.

**This right here is an opportunity to walk through the desert to see how successful you are at survival in the desert. To test your spirit against the ultimate challenge: owning one's self. How long until your spirit breaks? Probably not long but instil the idea of death properly in your mind, non existence forever is the most powerful source of energy to make the hard decisions in the present moment. Stay powerful and be cautious of emotions, self pity and other forms of weakness. Finally the most important way to travel in this journey is to "pour the water on the ground" as someone else on this forum once said. The water is tempting to drink in the desert but once you realise beyond the self doubt that you are powerful enough to pour the water and continue walking through the desert then you will be on your way to sure success. When you arrive in a situation where you are tempted to just fap or just watch one more video or any types of distractions, you should identify that they are glasses of water that you should pour on the ground and keep fighting in the desert.** </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes, because seeing things in context, the "big picture", is one of the most difficult intellectual challenges. Most lifeforms can't do it. It is our human gift to be able to juxtapose in the mind things that aren't juxtaposed in our environment. Especially intangible things like your own death. Imagining death as a thing and then placing that thing next to other things in the mind is hard work. Keep practicing.

That feeling where something you have been trying to do is placed into words and you finally feel that the meaning of such a task has been increased because someone else commented it </TEXT>

8. *you've already come this far close to orgasm + porn might as well orgasm*
that statement always leads me to failure, i don't know if there is some truth to it

9. came
