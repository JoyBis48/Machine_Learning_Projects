	<TEXT> Hey guys, so i've been playing a lightning crusader for a while and im pretty bored with it. I want to switch to fire, but i have +lightning dmg on a bunch of gear, and not many souls to reroll it to fire. So basically what im asking is, what should i look for as a fire crusader? i know i should try and get a cindercoat and maximus, but is there anything i should look for/spend most shards on? Any other advice/tips are welcome :)
