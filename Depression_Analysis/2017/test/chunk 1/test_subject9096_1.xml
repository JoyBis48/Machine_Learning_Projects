	<TEXT> Georgia Southern was barred from postseason FCS games last year because of the transition, but that was a team wide application.

	<TEXT> I believe that just such a situation is what the rule was created to prevent. 

However Georgia Southern has zero transfers and significantly less scholarships than other sunbelt teams, which is why we are appealing. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, the stupid rule thing is my main argument. We have met (and exceeded) all the FBS qualifications. We wouldn't have made the transfer if we didn't. I'm bummed out that we are the only conference champs whose season is (probably) already over. I'm bummed out for the senior players who stuck it through the transition, beat Florida in the Swamp, earned an undefeated conference championship, and now have to watch teams they beat go play on the national stage instead. Give me a ONE MORE TIME!!  :) </TEXT>
