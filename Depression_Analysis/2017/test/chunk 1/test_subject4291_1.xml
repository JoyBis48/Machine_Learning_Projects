	<TEXT> I definitely prefer Chii's rendition. In general I don't like a lot of KPP's music, save for a few songs. "Fun" is a good word to describe her music in general, in my opinion.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Gamers and designers of Reddit: Is it better to play an old game you love, or a new game in a franchise you know well (but don't necessarily care for)? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Is it better to play someone old, that you've played many times and has had quite an impact on your life, or to play something you haven't played, but you know the franchise, the mechanics, the rough story line etc? Is the (relativity small) novel experience more valuable than the nostalgic experience? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This had bugged me for some time, being a Belgian studying in America. I grew up speaking Dutch and French, so whenever an American pronounces a typical Dutch/French word incorrectly, it gets under my skin. 
One recent example is my professors pronunciation of 'apartheid'. In Afrikaans or Dutch it should be pronounced something like 'apart hide', but my profs use the American 'th' pronunciation in the word.

Am I in the wrong here? If no, what are foreign words that get mispronounced that really bug you? </TEXT>
