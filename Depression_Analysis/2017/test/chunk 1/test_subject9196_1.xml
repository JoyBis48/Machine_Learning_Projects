I would say that only downside of camera is a fact that it protrudes from body, so I often put finger on it - and then lens is dirty. So remember to swipe with t-shirt it before taking an awesome photo :) </TEXT>

So besides the phone (wireless) I can charge a mp3, or a tablet without getting under the desk. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Germany have them - code on each kitkat (outside) - bought 6 of them, and no prize.

Poland - they are but competition page says 1 more day and 20h to start of a competition. And code is going to be on a receipt/bill (so as I understand 1 per one shopping, not per bar).

Italy and Austria - I haven't seen them, when I checked 1 week ago. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Keep up with Google guidelines - for sure app using G+ multiplayer are not worst due to matter of used service. Take a look at Osmos HD multiplayer - quite nicely done!

I don't know how it is in your country/surrounding but more and more my friends started using G+ as it is more hmmm, lets say 'professional' (less family) and it is connected to your phone. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Some story behind that gif:
It was during EURO 2012 in Warsaw - when hosts (Poland) was playing with England - game was postponed. But there is a roof which (even despite that forecast was saying that it is going to rain) was left open.
As a result of waiting for the game, two guys run on pitch - they were arrested, but later on (as I remember correctly) their charges were withdrawn. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I got few pairs of headphones (always 'in ear' ones) which have same problem - one from pair is broken, in some of them it start working when you hold cable near jack (where cable ends, and jack starts) at special angle.
Is there any easy way to fix them? So far I was always buying a new pair (all of them last around 5-12 months), but it's enough! </TEXT>
