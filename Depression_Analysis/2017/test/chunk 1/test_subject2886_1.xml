	<TEXT> I'm the same. Mainly, though, for me, it's that both hands look pretty bad because I'm a n00b to this stuff.

My suggestion is to stabilize your non-dominant hand with your dominant one. Put your dominant pinkie on your non-dominant palm for painting the thumb, then do the same with your thumb for the others. Works for me on both sides, since I have really shaky hands. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In the post regarding cold weather wear (not sure how to link on mobile), there seems to be indecision about how fashionable the tights, knee high socks, and skirt combination is.

	<TEXT> I personally can't tell a difference between any type of condom, or between sex with a condom and bareback.

The one thing I *can* tell, is the difference between a condom with spermicide and any other type of sex. I know it's probably just me, because I am violently allergic to the stuff (like, lips swell shut and out, sitting down is really painful for a few days), but I've heard from other non-allergic people that it is drying and irritating. 

I'd say go for normal lubrication on your rubbers, in case she is allergic. Because if allergic reactions in your nose or eyes are bad, allergic reactions on your ladybits are awful. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> See, this particular paper is just a long rant in French about how "one true love" and "love at first sight" is a load of bullshit. I have to reference a couple works of 19th century French literature (can you tell yet that I'm a French major?) which, from my knowledge of the texts, all have to do with either "love makes life miserable" or "everything in my life sucks and I hate it all." I get to write two short papers for the class, so one is dealing with love, the other will be dealing with how literature from before modern psychology effected the idea that mental health is something that one should be at least reasonably knowledgeable about.

I'm not in serious paper writing mode or anything.

	<TEXT> Hello trees. I recently got arrested and had to give up the herb for a few months. I want to tell you all the story of how I learned that this plant is the best medication I could every ask for.

I'm a young female ent. I'm in college. I have a family history of depression, anxiety, OCD, and alcoholism. The first three have plagued me my whole life.

I did ballet for nine years growing up, which is not a healthy environment for a kid. It forces you, from a very young age, to try for perfection in every aspect of your life, which is simply unattainable and unhealthy. At age 12 I started cutting myself to cope with the feelings of inadequacy. By age 15 I was doing it every day. At 16 I was put on anti-anxiety medication by a doctor, which made me feel like an empty shell of a person. Instead of anxious and all the other emotions, I just felt no emotions. I was a bitch, and more people than I can count called me crazy on a daily basis. I didn't have any real friends, I never saw anyone outside of school.

Right before I graduated high school, I found an old childhood friend on Facebook. The same day he added me, he messaged me telling me we should hang out. Two hours later, I was in his car with some of his friends on the way to a beautiful lake in the country. We swim for a while, then get back up on the dock. He whips out a joint and lights it up. When he passed it to me, I said I had never smoked before, and his face instantly lit up. "Try it," he said, "you'll like it."

I had never felt so uplifted and happy in my life. It was like all the unnecessary, stupid worries that had always plagued me were dissolved from my brain. I just started laughing uncontrollably, almost crying because I had never been as relaxed as I was then.

I smoked every day for a year and a half. I got arrested, and as part of the treatment program the man put me in, I have to pass two piss tests. It has been two weeks today. I feel like I did for the six years leading up to that day. I have either gotten drunk or cut myself every day. I hate it. It is unhealthy, makes me feel like shit the next day, and isn't a good thing, considering the strong history of alcoholism in my family.

I am not applying to any graduate schools in states that don't allow medical marijuana. And I hope, if any of you other ents get to feeling low, anxious, and miserable like I've been and will be for the next few months, you will read this and remember: trees can help. I'm sure, for some of you, it won't, but for me, it is the best thing out there.

Toke one up for those who haven't yet discovered this magical plant. Not even for me, for that would be selfish. I hope that, one day, no one will have to cover up their bodies to hide from the embarrassment of self-inflicted injuries. No one will turn to the blade because they will have the herb instead.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I used to be like that. I hated being on top because I didn't know what I was doing. I either sat on the guy's dick or was folded over on top of him; either way, he was still doing most of the work.

Now being on top is second only to doggy. I do a lot of moving my hips by moving my body (former swimmer, it's a lot like the dolphin kick without the legs) and what are actually very similar to a man's thrusts, but with more emphasis on the back swing (if we're facing each other). I recently had some amazing sex on top doing this, I was able to be fucked as hard as I wanted without having to ask him to go harder.

As mentioned before, though, you are still a good lay if you keep doing what you're doing. If you want to do more, try adjusting the angle of your hips in missionary. To build up strength, try dancing around when you're alone. Focus on moving your hips in a circle while keeping your top half relatively still. It's a good ab workout, which never hurts anyway. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So, I've been seeing this guy for a couple weeks now, but we haven't gone on any real dates. We met and hit it off really well, but didn't really hang out. Then, three Fridays ago, he happens to be part of the crew I'm leading to a party (we're in college in my hometown, so everyone relies on me to know where places are) and I just sort of decide to make moves on him. We leave the party to get smokes and he decides to bum to me for the night. We leave with his roommate to go to another party, then we end up very drunkenly wandering around campus. I end up going back to his dorm and we have sex. Next day he comes over to my dorm, we cuddle under a blanket for hours and then he spends the night. We hung out nearly every day, sometimes spending the night. A week after that first night, he invites me over to his friend from home's house and he has his arm around me for most of the night as a lot of other people from his hometown come over. I went over there again last night with his roommate and got way too drunk and the guy ended up having to take care of me, which I hate. I apologize and he says it isn't a big deal and happens to everyone.

What's bothering me is that we haven't had the 'are we dating' conversation because I don't want to rush it, nor do I really even know what I want. However, multiple people have either asked me if we're dating, or congratulated me on my new 'relationship.' I'm very confused, because I don't think what we've been doing is dating, but other people seem to think so. Are we dating? We haven't gone out anywhere together, there's just an obvious mutual interest.

Tl; dr, I've been hanging out and having sex with this guy I'm into, but I don't think we're dating, despite what other people say. Are we? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It may not be great. It may hurt a bit. My first time was great, didn't hurt at all, and generally awesome, but that seems to be unusual. I fell into the 'we had sex, now I'm in love with you' trap, although that may be because I had known the guy since childhood. 

As for getting handsy, follow his lead. Start off with a hand in his hair and one on his neck. Slide one down his chest or his back. I like to lightly massage his shoulders. Then grab his hips, pull him in closer. If he touches any part of you, it's fair game to touch the same parts of him. I really like to rub all around his cock, but not touch him until he starts rubbing in between my legs. If he's not hard enough for you to feel it through his pants by then, don't worry. He'll get there. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This week I fucked a guy I've had my eye on for a while now. We went to a party with a bunch of friends, then decided to leave for another one. We were pretty drunk by the time we left the second party, and then had to make the trek across campus. We held hands and stopped on several benches just to cuddle and look at the stars. We got back to his dorm and sat listening to Pink Floyd's Wish You Were Here (one of my all-time favorite albums) while making out. Things got hot and heavy and I ended up spending the night. Next day he and his roommate come to my dorm just because and we ended up sitting cuddled under a blanket outside for hours and hours. Then he came to my room, we laid in bed and watched tv for a while before fucking. He spent the night and most of the day. 

Seems less like a sexual achievement, but I have been afraid to let myself just be intimate without having sex since I got out of my first LTR. I've had hook ups, and a short fling (I had to break it off because I started to have feelings that we both knew would never be reciprocated), but I feel so comfortable with this kid. I'm just going to let it keep happening and see where it goes, but I really think I could let myself get feelings for him without it being unrequited. 

Also, he helped me with my insecurities about my oral skills -- he had to stop me multiple times because I was "just too good at it." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I also am diagnosed with GAD, and I have tripped a few times. I dropped acid the first time three days after a massive panic attack, and it went fine. It may help you to write on yourself. I have seen people put "don't panic," "it's just the drug," or "enjoy yourself" on their arms. That can really help, because, if you get lost in your own head, you can look down and see the words. 

As has been said already, don't let yourself be alone. It is good to have a sober person with you, so that you have someone who knows to watch out for you. I think LSD and other psychedelics have helped me figure things out, including the sources of my anxiety.

I hope it turns out well for you. </TEXT>

And boys, if you didn't know why they put that warning on the stuff, its because, when you have a boner, the blood is trapped in there until you soften up. While the blood is trapped, it can't bring fresh oxygen to the cells in the penis. After four hours, a lot of those cells will have died. After long enough, the entire penis will die and, ultimately, fall off.
