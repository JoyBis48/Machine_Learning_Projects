	<TEXT> Thanks for so long and insightful answer.
So first about Akira - i watched and i liked it even trough it was kinda mindfuck.
FLCL - i ve seen like 3 ep and i was like WTF?! im planning to watch more but i cant force myself to
DTB - amazing one, just watchin it
Samurai Champloo is on the list same goes for Baccano.
I know i will have to watch Cowboy Bebop and Trigun at some point :) and for the Hunter x Hunter im gonna give it another shot - i watched few first episodes and it just didnt pull me in, but maybe i just wasnt far enough. Guess im gonna try the Black Lagoon then go for Samurai Champloo and as for manga i will give a Berserk a shot. </TEXT>
