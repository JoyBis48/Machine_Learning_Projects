	<TEXT> I'm against it as the consequences of failure could lead to the irradiation of an entire province. Plus our electricity demands don't require a nuclear power station.

To look at Germany, Spain   Portugal achieve 40% upwards of their needs via renewables last year - it would seem irrational of us to go with nuclear.

Then the cost of the radioactive waste disposal is a bill our childrens' Ireland have to pick up, and most countries with the capacity will not accept another country's waste. IIRC there are ships with nuclear waste which simply circle the globe while governments fight over who is going to take it.

I think nuclear is a solution to a problem we don't have, and there are better solutions available. Finally, when a country with the engineering expertise and reputation such as Germany reckons they can do without - why would we join the nuclear party when everyone else is leaving for very good reasons. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Cheers for the tip Eamon!

I've no interest in this government or any other one privatising domestic water provision by stealth. And it's unlikely this can be anything else, plus I really don't appreciate having to pay for the metering such companies will have to rely on. In fairness, Phil Hogan is in charge of it - and we all saw the suspicious fiasco he caused with Greyhound.

On a more general note, I'll do my upmost to make sure that any issues that effect the whole country will be "trawled in the media" at every opportunity I get.

Of course, in case anyone has forgotten here's a [little link](http://www.broadsheet.ie/2011/06/01/say-it-aint-so-eamo/) to just how two-faced that travesty of a TD truly is. </TEXT>

and there's a few more community images here:

http://forum.odroid.com/viewtopic.php?f=77 t=3410 

The U2 / U3 images are interchangable 99% of the time, so don't let that put you off.

The user who creates the majority of these images 'robroy' is fantastic, so asking in the forums would be the best thing.

The first image should fit the bill. I'd certainly start with the images from the forums, rather than creating your own isos, as they work 'out of the box' and take away most of the fiddling around for drivers etc.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I absolutely love them. Versatile and small, I'm setting one up for a friend who wants a pc on their TV and I'll be able to velcro the odroid to the back of the tv for extra tidiness.

Here's a quick comparison [photo](http://i.imgur.com/hQ7KFAx.jpg), U2 on the left and the U3 on top of the Pi. I'm not sure they sell the U2 anymore.

If you do go for one, I'd also get an 8gb eMMC card rather than boot from an SD card - the eMMC are really fast. 

Though it's very handy for testing to use SDs and a lot of people have SDs sitting around unused. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I use an Odroid U2 as a home server, NAS, book server, torrenting machine, motion server and all of that barely stresses it.

They've upgraded it now to the [U3](http://hardkernel.com/main/products/prdt_info.php) (an extra USB port, slimmer profile). It's $59 before shipping and is even slightly smaller than the Pi :)

There's loads of tips and projects on the [forums](http://forum.odroid.com/) too. I use one as my main desktop too as they're fanless and silent.

Just to add, I still use my Pi for XBMC as its gpu is better at 1080p than the Odroid's, though not by much. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's the Last of Us for me.

I enjoyed Bioshock: Infinite, its weaker parts are better than many other games' good parts - but I think the game doesn't work as a complete experience in the way TLoU does.

B:I has nowhere near as much tension, and so doesn't pull you in or make you care to succeed / survive to the extent TLoU does.

Often during B:I I felt like I was wondering around a deserted museum. A museum filled with glimpses of the game that could have been, and I suspect a game that was diminished so it could be coded for current-gen consoles (e.g. the difference between the final game and the initial [years old trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajCiS0_ssLE) which still to me has more tension than the acutal game).

I felt I played all the game that Naughty Dog wanted to make and I would have played hours more of it.

I was glad to reach the end of B:I and kinda finished it just to see the end for myself - I was ready to finish the game hours earlier.

As for the 'current leaks', that refers to the GPU clock speed. I'm sure if it was a differentiator between the consoles, the console with the higher speed would have announced it already.

If there was an XB1 tech-spec sheet with the same level of detail as the PS4 then we could all settle the differences between the two, when are MS going to reveal more details I wonder. What's the delay?

http://www.anandtech.com/show/6972/xbox-one-hardware-compared-to-playstation-4/2

On the graphics side its once again obvious that Microsoft and Sony are shopping at the same store as the Xbox Ones SoC integrates an AMD GCN based GPU. Heres where things start to get a bit controversial. Sony opted for an 18 Compute Unit GCN configuration, totaling 1152 shader processors/cores/ALUs. Microsoft went for a far smaller configuration: 768 (12 CUs).

Microsoft cant make up the difference in clock speed alone (AMDs GCN seems to top out around 1GHz on 28nm), and based on current leaks it looks like both MS and Sony are running their GPUs at the same 800MHz clock. The result is a 33% reduction in compute power, from 1.84 TFLOPs in the PS4 to 1.23 TFLOPs in the Xbox One.  </TEXT>

I'm sure it could be put to use when games aren't running. Though with the consoles expected to be on shelves in 5 months, these drip-feeds of info better not be what developers are also getting. </TEXT>

To be honest, I think the article creates as many questions as it answers.

A detailed one-sheet spec from MS themselves would be handy at this stage, the speculation won't go away until there are some solid numbers.

I won't be getting either console until they've been 'out in the wild' for a while anyway. Though if details don't come soon - I'm betting that MS could end up with a warehouse full of lemons by January. Word spreads a lot faster than it did 7 years ago. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The PS4 hardware has clear advantages.

The XB1's response to these apparent advantages is its eSRAM - if this works as planned it should balance out, some to most of, the hardware differences.

There is only 32MB of the eSRAM available. So it has to used for something important, and also something that isn't (in data terms) very big. Probably data that needs to be quickly delivered and then replaced with an updated version and delivered again. Software will have to be written with that in mind.

If the eSRAM can't be used like this or if it's too tricky to make it useful that way - then devs might avoid it and the processing of the game will suffer. PS4 games would look better and cost less to get looking that way. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> True, I should have put that in the title.

At the same time, I can't find any dates for the grey countries. Asia is not coming on-line until the end of 2014 and I can't find info on whether that's all countries in Asia or a selection.

I really can't understand why Portugal isn't ready for launch while Brazil is.

If I find any dates I'll include them here. </TEXT>

Though for people in Portugal, they're out of luck - which I'm not sure about as Brazil made it onto the list.

	<TEXT> It's not that the TV part won't allow me, but that the licensing agreements across Europe are so problematic that there isn't even a standard Netflix catalog.

As for sports, I don't think there's any hope Microsoft can provide on that while even fully licensed national stations can't agree with each other pan-europa.

Plus each nation has its list of national free-to-air sports events that must be shown free-of-charge. Disallowing Microsoft from showing them to Xbox Live only subscribers - not a business incentive for them. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh, I know there's no solid info - yet when Kinect came out initially there were similar claims to have 'not-abandoned-the-core-gamers'. That didn't pan out and neither did a ground-swell of Kinect fans.

Microsoft will be in a great position if/when they've 8 new games to tout at E3 for the X1 but they don't have a previous delivery on promises to back it up.

Sony have presented many PS4 exclusives already, and they haven't shown the machine yet.

It's all very crazy, but either PR companies are toying with them both for shits/giggles/profits, or one of them will have some pointless advertising bills to pay.

I'm in Europe so the TV part of the X1 won't sell it to me - there needs to be very compelling games; the spy-in-the-cab isn't helping either. </TEXT>
