	<TEXT> Heh, thanks. Whether this subreddit takes off or not, I just think it's more relevant now that nin has effectively disbanded and that Trent is having just as much success outside of the nineinchnails box. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think that would be great. I also think that if Trent were a redditor and he saw posts of his new work being submitted in r/nin, it would be a little bit...inappropriate. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I read that Big Man With a Gun was a song that Trent had his only TDS regrets about, as it was a jab at American gangster rap.  If he did an AMA I'd like to know what other musical regrets he has, and if Big Man With a Gun is still one of them.

	<TEXT> What's the DVD called? I just thought it was part of the viral campaign Trent did for Year Zero. About a minute in I was thinking the sound is really good for somebody filming in the crowd. I nearly didn't watch all of it because I saw that there wasn't enough time in the video for The Wretched to follow The Frail. Glad I did.   </TEXT>
