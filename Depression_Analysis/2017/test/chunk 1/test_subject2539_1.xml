	<TEXT> I had read order of the phoenix about two weeks within its release and I loved it. School librarian actually set it aside for me. Then when HBP eventually came out, I got spoiled :/ the big spoiler.

didn't read it until years later about a couple months after the fifth film came out. Completely rekindled my love in the series and I read deathly hallows immediately after. I read it again, and I think its my favorite, either 6,5, or 3. 


chamber of secrets was always my least favorite.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I just finished "The Road" tonight at 1 am after starting at about 9pm and taking a thirty something minute break at the hundred page milestone. So about 3.5 hours for a 287 page novel. Book was amazing btw, I've had my copy for at least five years and I've attempted starting it twice, getting only to the thirtieth page or so, so I challenged myself tonight to just read the fucking book. Really glad I did, book has entered my top ten.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've read very little Sci fi in my life, barely Sci fi actually, just Kurt Vonnegut's work and The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy, as you can see I'm more into the light stuff, but I would like branching out. I don't want something too far fetched and I don't want anything military.

any SciFi novels out there that are serious in tone but do not revolve around a military, or a space soldier? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> ----" The Stranger" Spoilers----- 

I realized that enough time has passed since 10th grade and that I needed to re-read "The Stranger" by Albert Camus. Since I've been reading some Vonnegut lately, I was kind of shocked by how cold Meaursault is in The Stranger, I had been getting accustomed to lively characters, and hilarious narraration so the change of pace took some getting used to. 


"The Stranger" is a very short book, only 120 pages long, so I read it all in one sitting. Interestingly as I read it I kept jumping back in my mind to when I was still in 10th grade, sitting in that class as we discussed in our own little mini trial whether the murder was premeditated or if Mersault had any possible defense. 


I don't reread novels, I feel as if once is good enough, but I'm starting to realize I was wrong. Maybe rereading a book is in a way being in two places of time at once, the first time, and then the now. Or maybe I've just been reading too much Vonnegut and I'm starting to not see time as linear. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not exactly a robbery, more like a breaking and entering. It was a just sold home in my ex girlfriends neighborhood, and it was pretty easy to get in. We go in and look around the house, have sex in the closet, no furniture yet, and then she finds a panini maker inside the kitchen cupboard. We decide to take it. Then I raid the fridge and find four coronas, and we proceed to sit there by ourselves in a strangers new home and drink their beer all sweaty post sex. Months later she breaks up with me. We never told our friends about our little breaking and entering. Sucks that one of my favorite life memories was with someone I never want to see again. 

She kept the panini maker.
