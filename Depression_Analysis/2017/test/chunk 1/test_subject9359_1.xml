	<TEXT> i am in a very loving relationship. we have been together for 2 years. we live together. but our sex life is unfulfilling. it hasn't always been. at the start we had sex all the time and it was amazing. but he is on antidepressants and it crushes his libido and he can't get hard properly or for long. we have tried viagra but it wasn't the same. i don't know what to do. he was a virgin before me. and he is the 17th guy I've had sex with. so sex means a lot to me. it is making me unhappy. we bought a vibrator which spices things up but its not being fucked with a cock. am i being selfish? we do oral which is great but it gets boring. i have thought about leaving him. i have thought about cheating on him. i don't want to do either. should i just be okay with sex every 2 months? we usually do other stuff like fingering and hang jobs weekly.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> i wish i was dead. i am usually really apathetic about it. i just want it to happen and me not to have to do anything. 

i have no more energy. 

i want to slice my skin open. i am fighting it. i have self harmed in the past but managed to stop. 

i don't care about myself anymore. i don't wash. 

i feel like i need to do something quick. 

i am in a loving relationship. he has depression and is very stable. he is understanding. but the sex life is diminished. i want sex. 

i am all over the place. 

i managed to ring for help when i wanted to kill myself. i wanted to jump off a bridge.

i am fat and i over eat.

	<TEXT> I am in a very similar place. I have been dealing with depression for the past 5 years. i have tried to kill myself in the past. i have self harmed in the past. this is my first comment on reddit and i have joined reddit about 15 minutes ago. i have no one to turn to. i have been in and out of doctors rooms for a while now. I have my first psychiatrist appointment in 2 months and i don't think i can last until now. i haven't self harmed for a long time but i really really want to. i want to kill myself and am fighting it. i am really unhappy. i can't find my way out. also i get really severe pain in my back and neck from the stress of it all. 

its good you are getting help. the line you wrote ' I have a lot of trouble concentrating and sometimes it's hard for me to speak clearly or in complete sentences. ' its like i was writing it because i get that.  </TEXT>
