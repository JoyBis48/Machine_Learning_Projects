	<TEXT> I went to the optometrist after a 4 day crank bender one time. He says to me, he says "Holy cow! Your pupils are huge! I don't even need to use the dilation solution!". So I says to him, I says "Yeah, I forgot to take my Klonopin this morning!". And so he says to me, he says "Oh. OK." Afterward I went out to my Jeep and my buddy (who was waiting in the car) has my hood popped and all my doors open, scouring the whip with a washcloth. I says to him, I says "God damn Robby, you hit the shit again, didn't ya?" And he says to me, he says "Yup. You were taking forever". 

I was only in there for like 20 minutes. That brother got issues. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Once I got like 95 Dilaudid 4's and I shot them all with my girlfriend over the course of like 60 hours. I didn't shit for maybe two days, and i didn't think anything of it because I was always doing meth and not shitting a whole lot anyways. Well, on the third day, I suddenly had to shit. It didn't feel crazy or anything, just the normal bowel movement feelings. I went and got on the toilet and I pushed and it felt like the fat end of a bowling pin was trying to squeeze out my asshole. I pushed and pushed and it got just to the point where I couldn't just pull my pants up and get laxative and wait, cuz it was too far out, but at the same time it was still not coming out at all. I tried picking at it, but the way it was shaped it just didn't do any good. After 67 minutes of straight pushing on the toilet, sweatin my balls off, it finally came out. I have never experienced such a relief as I did that day, in that moment. I was so happy, the whole time I was pushing all I could think about were all the times I wasn't constipated that I took for granted. It was really a glorious one. It was shaped like a football and it was easily the widest I've ever had. I almost wanted to weigh it. But yeah so I know what you mean by bein so desperate you want to pick at it.

	<TEXT> I take Green Bali and Red Vein Sumatran twice a day, about 6-8 grams total. The Bali doesn't block me up, but the Sumatran does. Most of the time I manage to squeeze one or two small bowel movements a day, but it's common for me to go a few days without having one. It always comes around the third day, but this is obviously not a comfortable schedule. What does everybody recommend to take in order to regulate my bowl movements? I have no plans of dropping the kratom as a whole, or the Red Vein Sumatran, for that matter. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I go 2-3 grams of Red Vein Sumatran to 1-1.5 grams of Green Bali chased with a little ginger ale to (successfully) counteract nausea. I do it at 7 am and then again around 5-6 pm. I think your best way of cutting back would be to stop cold turkey for a few days and then continue at a lower dose, because lowering your dose without clearing your system out might lead to disappointing effect.

I love kratom. It's the shit. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I feel like you maybe ought to tackle one thing at a time. That's what counselors suggest and I can see why they do... like maybe start taking kratom first in lieu of alcohol, since I'm pretty sure that's probably your biggest problem. After a few months of stability, then you should try substitution for the caffeine and nicotine. 

That's just my opinion. I understand why they tell you to do it that way... quitting alcohol, cigs and caffeine all at once seems like it could possibly be disastrous before long. Then again, kratom does some wonderful things. Just my 2 cents. </TEXT>

I did them both together for a long time, but then whenever I would smoke weed without being high on opiates, I would get absolutely horrible anxiety. I just ended up quitting weed completely, because it doesn't appeal to me any more... but that sounds kinda the same as you're experiencing. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah usually I don't bother responding to articles like that but it put me over the edge when he recommended a benzo. I also just couldn't believe all the comments absolutely bashing kratom. People abuse it in order to get high and then are somehow surprised it becomes a problem for them. I don't use it because I want to get high, I use it because I want to stay sober.

Congratulations on your clean time. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've never even heard of this. 2 micrograms seems like a very small amount, since there's 2 milligrams in an 8 mg suboxone strip and that's hardly even really active at an oral dose. Wouldn't taking any amount of nalaxone with opiates just offset the opiate's affinity for the opiate receptors , so taking a small dose of nalaxone would be like taking a little less oxycodone than you actually ingested? Are you supposed to still feel the effects of the oxycodone when you make this combo, and still have your tolerance lowered at the same time? Confusing stuff. </TEXT>
