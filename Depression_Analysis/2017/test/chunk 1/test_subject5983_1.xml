	<TEXT> I was at a Chili's (chain restaurant). We had just ordered a desert when the guy in front of us starting violently projectile vomiting all over his table and the aisle and all surrounding tables. Eventually the ambulance showed up and took him away. He never stopped vomiting. Worst part: we were in an alcove and he was blocking the way out, so we were trapped behind him, with our food and table puke-drizzled, for a good 15 minutes.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Once when I was in middle school, I had an english teacher who was always getting on to me about leaning back in my chair. I didn't purposefully do it, it was just a bad habit. But after like the 5th time she had to tell me not too, she flipped out and threw a mug across the room and yelled at me saying that she wished I would fall over and crack my head open and shatter my skull because that would make me learn my lesson. She ranted on for a good 3 minutes before she just left the classroom. Everyone just kind of sat there and stared at me for a few minutes before we left. 

The next day she called me into her office and calmy, but very angrily, asked if I had been going around the school telling everyone that she said she wanted me to get brain damage and die (which she did), and I had to explain to her that considering she yelled at me in front of the entire class for five minutes, there was a good chance that I wasn't the only one that heard her wishes. She started grinding her teeth and shaking and told me to leave, and as soon as the door shut I heard her start hitting her desk and trying to hold in her screams.


Later that year, she tried to get me suspended/expelled for racism and called me in front of the principal and religion teacher and a bunch of other staff to discuss this, and they all realized she was talking out of her ass. I left that school after that year, but turned out she had some mental issues. She was fired the next year for assault with a deadly weapon (not in the classroom or anything). Her mugshot was hilarious. Always wanted to visit her in prison.  </TEXT>
