	<TEXT> Were you even playing the game? I've almost finished, making mostly a renegade campaign, and I am deeply affected by the choices I've made. I lied to the Wrex about the Genophage, wiped out the entire Quarian fleet and watched the wreckage burn like fireworks in the sky of their homeworld, mercy-killed an Ardat-Yakshi, watched Tali kill herself....all because of choices I have made (or didn't make). I would say in comparison to ME1 and 2, the choices are much deeper in ME3, more emotionally connected. I really like playing the renegade campaign, and found it pretty easy to play along in ME1 and 2, but in 3, I really can feel the emotional impact of my choices. I can't be the only one who finds this a masterpiece of space opera. 

[EDIT] I'm going to get drunk and finish the game tonight so I'll post later and tell you guys my final assessment..but so far its been pretty fun. So far I've gotten my moneys worth.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Do a majority of PC gamers think that Halo and it's sequels suck?  </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2010-10-05 09:22:04 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Three things concerning Halo and it's sequels (anyone else feel this way?) 

1. When I'm over at a friends house and the only multiplayer game they own is Halo, I instantly lose some respect for that friend.

2. When I am forced in a situation where I must play one or two minutes of Halo, it feels as if I am defying one of my base morals, and I lose a little respect for myself.

3. WTF? Another Halo? Doesn't anyone realize how much Halo sucks, and how awful it is compared to this generation's FPS (single and multiplayer) greats? 

In conclusion, HALO SUCKS BALLSAKS.  </TEXT>
