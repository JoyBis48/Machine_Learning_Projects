	<TEXT> Mine generally have to be in omelet form. Scrambled is a weird texture, and if the yolk and whites are separate, I can't stand the taste. Mushroom, tomato, onion, pepper, and cheese omelet is my favorite. 

As a kid and even a teen, I hated beans, but since becoming vegetarian I have tried them again and opened up to them. 

Ice cream is obviously delicious, but milk has always been my beverage of choice. 

I looked for my main nutrition book to see if I could find any more information, but it's back at my parents' place. When I go home for thanksgiving I'll see if it has anything else to say about it and if it has anything about nutrition and depression. 

Where are you looking to attend and what do you want to major in? Anything science tends to do that until enough information, research, and studies are available to come to a definite conclusion. In all of my classes I have been taught omega 3 is beneficial. 

Me too, I just searched my schools courses to see if any went over nutrition and depression/anxiety, but I wasn't able to find anything.

I've started searching online for local psychiatrists/therapists, and it is slightly overwhelming.  

Respecting my likes and dislikes is something I need to work on. I don't mind going to the bar and being social, but I'm kind of past the drunken college party scene. 

I know you said changing your diet helped, but are you also currently taking any medication or seeking counseling? (I apologize if you've already covered this, I'm on my phone and I'm not sure how to see previous posts while typing a reply. :/) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I eat eggs occasionally, but have always been super picky with how they have to be cooked, otherwise I don't like the taste. 

The best sources for protein are definitely from meat, dairy products are also good and grains have some protein, but not much. I get most of my protein from dairy products and beans. I absolutely love milk and skim actually has more protein than whole milk.

If you're interested in studying nutrition, go for it. There is a lot of information out there and you could easily purchase books and learn a lot on your own. Just make sure they are credible. Nutrition is just my minor, but in my spare time I try to learn as much as I can.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Nutrition is one of the things I'm studying in school, and what you're saying makes a lot of sense. I've been pescatarian (vegetarian but eats seafood) for about 8 months now, and I'm sure I have several deficiencies based on my diet that hasn't helped my depression.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Exactly. If I could pinpoint it, then I could fix it. 

I'm sorry you're in the same boat. I wouldn't wish this feeling on anyone.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I know for me to actively seek out a therapist is probably the hardest thing for me, but probably the best step for me as well. I've admitted to myself that something isn't right, but if I admit it to someone else, that would mean I can't pretend that I'm okay anymore. 

One of my biggest fears is being told by a therapist that I need to just get over it - I know how ridiculous that sounds.  </TEXT>
