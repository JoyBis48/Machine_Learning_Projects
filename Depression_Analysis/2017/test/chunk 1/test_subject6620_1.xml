	<TEXT> Gone are the days when the Wolves were the only independent club in the IHL; I miss that. It's partly said "business" and partly the growing emphasis on the AHL being a developmental league. It seems that the number of veterans a club is allowed keeps shrinking. 

But with an impending lockout there is a great deal to be excited about this October! The roster will be stacked, and Wendell has brought Haydar and Sterling back together too.    </TEXT>
