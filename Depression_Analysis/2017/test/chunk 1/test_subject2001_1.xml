	<TEXT> I remember back in the pre-season where Rex Grossman and John Beck were competing for the starting job, and The Redskins went undefeated in the preseason. It looked like we were on pace for a great season, but ultimately had once again another terrible one. I know RGIII looked less than good but I'm just saying that this is preseason so don't get too sad yet. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think Lebron is doing this because he realizes that Cleveland does not have the players to win a championship. Make the finals? Sure why not, East is pretty weak (getting better I may add). But against the west? I don't think so. </TEXT>
