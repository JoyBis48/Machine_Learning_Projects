	<TITLE> Anyone know something about recurring dreams? </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> About once a month or so, I have a recurring dream. Though all the details aren't exactly the same, the main plot is. The dream: I'll be minding my business going along dream world doing whatever when all of a sudden I'm a couple feet off the floor just floating there. I can control where I float to pretty easily. I'll usually float around for a few minutes enjoying myself. After a while a sudden blanket of fear over comes me. The only sound I can make is a wailing banshee or ghost like sound. I hear it in my dream and out loud. My wife wakes me up because it freaks her out. By the way, I can not mimic the sound while I'm awake, it's a way higher pitched sound than I can consciously make. My question to you Reddit is can anyone help me understand what could possibly be going on? Also, has anyone of you experienced anything similar? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> All I can say about most of this is, yes some customers are dicks. The thing is most of you are complaining about customers doing regular customer stuff. Customers have every right to pay with whatever method the store promises to accept. Customers shouldn't put money in their mouths out bras or whatever it's gross. If a customer wants to use a coupon that isn't expired and they have the product the coupon promises to cover, then you can't be mad at a customer for holding up the line. It's not the customer's fault if some stores punish cashiers for slow time. A lot of the comments on here are ridiculous. Maybe you should find a different job. I worked retail and ran into the same stuff. What was different for me? I actually know how to work in retail. Stop complaining about customers being customers. That's like saying babies shouldn't cry or dogs shouldn't bark. If a price rings up wrong and a customer complains about it there is a great chance they aren't accusing you off fixing the wrong price they are being human and just blaming the nearest person. Not everyone that comes through your line thinks like you. Some of your customers have never worked retail, they only know what it's like to be a customer. You find certain things to be "simple" or "common sense" but that's because you're around it all the time. I bet some of your cruddy customers find other things to be "simple" or "common sense" that you might not immediately do the same wary they do. Customers are the reason your job exists. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> It's dark </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-02-21 17:07:15 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Little Johnny likes playing hooky quite often and he hides in his mom's closet until she takes a nap. One day he plays hooky as usual but today a strange guy comes over and he and Johnny's mom have sex. Right as they're finishing up johnny's dad comes home early so the man hides in the closet. The following conversation occurs:
"It's dark in here, huh?"
Shut up kid, I'm hiding.
"Wanna buy my baseball?"
No, shut up!
"I'm gonna tell my daddy on you for what you were doing to my mom"
Fine! I'll buy the damn ball if you shut up. How much?
" 300 dollars"
No way I'm paying that much!
" I'm gonna tell"
Fine, ya rip off! Here.

They swap the money and the ball.

A few days later the strange guy is back at it and Johnny's dad comes home early again and the guy hides in the closet again. The following conversation occurs:
"It's dark in here huh?"
Yeah. Shut up.
" wanna buy a baseball glove?"
No. Not this time.
"I'll tell daddy"
Fine. How much?
" 700 dollars"
No way!
"Yes or I'm gonna scream"

Needless to say, they swap cash for glove.

The next day Johnny's dad asks him if he wants to play catch. Johnny says "that'll be hard to do without my ball and glove." And his dad asks what happened to it. Johnny explains he sold them for $1000.
Infuriated, his dad brings him to church to confess.
He puts Johnny in the booth and the following conversation occurs:
" it's dark in here huh?"
Don't start that shit again you little rip off! </TEXT>

I don't care what it is, I wont eat it if there are people (especially ones I don't know or rarely see). I'll be thinking "Ooh there's cake.... *goes to get cake* wait, there's people.. lots and lots of people... fuck it, there's a slight chance there'll be some left" to myself "RETREAT!" </TEXT>
