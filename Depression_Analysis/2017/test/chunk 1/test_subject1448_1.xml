	<TEXT> Same thing here. It used to happen with me last year, i had 2~3 ''visions'' per day, and I got used to it just like you. My ''visions'' were from minor events of the day, not only when someone was about to call me. Nowadays, i think i have 1 ''vision'' per week, don't know why this happened =/ </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Wow!! That's an amazing experience/writing. In my country, the use of hallucinogenic mushrooms is a very discussed (and studied) thing: the presence of trusted people alongside you, during the trip, is very important indeed to the trip travel safer roads.

One question: do you remember the species (and the dosage that you guys used that night) of those shrooms? It is a valuable information, cause the totality of the trip fully depends of those partcular factors.

Again, nice experience, bro. Would have gilded if i had gold jajajajaja. </TEXT>
