	<TEXT> The Patriot Act wasn't about patriotism. It was about control.

The Affordable Care Act wasn't about affordability.  It was about control.

Net Neutrality isn't about neutrality.  It's about control.


Freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction. We didn't pass it to our children in the bloodstream. It must be fought for, protected, and handed on for them to do the same, or one day we will spend our sunset years telling our children and our children's children what it was once like in the United States where men were free. 
-Ronald Reagan
