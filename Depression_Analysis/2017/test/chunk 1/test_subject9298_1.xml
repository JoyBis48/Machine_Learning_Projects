	<TEXT> I don't understand why so many women feel like they need to make a baby. Everyone wants to experience pregnancy. 
Why the fuck would you want to go through that kind of pain? Stretch marks, weight gain, all kinds of complications during the pregnancy, and then of course, labour. Not to mention, raising a newborn is a pain in the ass. 
Yeah, I'd rather adopt.
For me at least, I really couldn't care less if my child looks like me or not. I feel like a much better person knowing that I'm going to hopefully be giving some child's a better life rather than making another useless human to take up more space. </TEXT>
