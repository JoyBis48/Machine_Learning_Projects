	<TEXT> For all you know I myself am a stripper, or I have children that are and support them even if I don't agree with them.
I've got an idea; How about we don't project our personal feelings on a given subject onto one another, insisting the other is wrong and we are right? Deal?
*Hint* THAT is liberalism. Live and let live. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I find it very irritating how often the article referred to him as "the stripper".

There's nothing wrong with stripping, but that's not all he is. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The things I've seen working at my copy shop (copying depositions from lawsuits and court cases mostly) have left me unable to sleep at night. I've met a few of the defendants, and I never would have known otherwise what they are guilty of. If ignorance is bliss, knowledge is a burden.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The biggest thing I think he's missing here is that just because his friend or people like him may not have laid a hand on an underage person, but someone else had to in order to create the content he's "harmlessly" viewing. He didn't do the abuse, but someone with a camera has to in order to catch those vile images. This perpetuates the market for such images and videos. Other sick people are fulfilling a need created by these 60 year old white guys. Cut off the demand, the supply withers and dies and no more children are harmed.

	<TITLE> Have a signed contract ensuring I get a monthly bonus but haven't gotten one in over a year. How do I go forward? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> When i got the job offer for my original position it included a contract stating I would get a monthly bonus based off the store's income for that month. The percentage wasn't specified, but both myself and the business owner signed it. I've been with my employer for a little over a year and a half now, have sense gotten a promotion and 2 raises but have only gotten 3 bonuses totaling $200, the last one being over a year ago. We haven't posted a single loss since I've been here, and we just wrapped up our best month of the year. Well, I get my check today and...no bonus!! This is really starting to piss me off. I've talked to the owner about it before and all I get is "yeah, we haven't been doing very well. Not a lot of profit." But as the manager I have full access to our finances and I can see that we did *worse* those few times I did get a bonus compared to our lowest month this year! How do I approach this without calling my boss a liar or cheapsake? I really need this job but I'm completely being used here.


EDIT: Thanks for the advice! I'll that those wise words and see what I can make happen :) </TEXT>
