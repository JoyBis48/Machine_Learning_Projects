Why does the download speed fluctuate in the pattern it does? I don't know much about the way internet magic works, but you can explain it in full science if it is easiest for you and I'll google the words I don't understand.

Edit: To be clear, that last line was a joke. I'm sure I'll understand however you explain it. Thanks for the replies so far!

Final Edit: Among the other good replies, 3brushie answered my question completely. I'd link to his comment, but not only do I not know how to do it the Reddit way, but it's also only about 10 inches down the page. Thanks askscience, I hope we can do this again sometime. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What are the chances that we in America won't get the Freedom edition?  It's announced in Europe and Asia, but we have no word of it coming to America. With only a few months to go before the release, it seems like the winners of the American Revolution won't get the game based on the American Revolution. What do you guys think? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I thought of that, and I tried the bubble, but the spear throwers' spears go over half way through the bubble before they are slowed, which made my head explode. Losing wave of force for the slightly useful bubble wasn't worth it. More signs point to elective mode </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Like I said, I don't have my pc near me otherwise I would. I have around 230 intelligence and 1500 health I believe. About 126 arcane power. I generally two shot the standard enemies of the beginning of act 3 with arcane orb, but when I run out of arcane power its impossible to kite because I cant move fast enough to dodge attacks </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Elective mode and surviving help </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I realize I'm probably pretty terrible at this game, but its very tough for me not to die as a wizard on act 3 in *normal* difficulty. I use ice armor, crystal skin, wave of force, spectral blade, and arcane orb.


First off, I don't like the idea of elective mode. I think you should play the game as it was originally intended to be played. Am I just going to have to get over that?


Second, any strategies for me as a noob for surviving? The spear throwers, demons who stick they're arms in the ground, and fireball spitting bat things kill me pretty fast, because I can't move away fast enough to not get hit. Any advice would be awesome!


Btw, I believe I'm level 24, (away from my pc right now) and I don't play often because I'm more of a console gamer. Help me get back into diablo!


Edit: Thanks so far for all the helpful tips. It looks like I need to go ahead and buy auction house items (something I was against) and use elective mode (something else I was against). Ill give these a try </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Haven't found/been able to create an item with life absorption yet, but I'll keep that in mind. And I haven't been using stun, but I suppose you're right. I'm just afraid it won't affect a large boss like the Skeleton King. I don't have a templar yet but I'll use him when I get him. Thanks for the advice so far.

	<TEXT> I've been playing as a monk, but never playing alone. Fighting everything is easy. Now that I'm trying to play a bit of the game solo, it's not as easy. I started a new character as a barbarian, and while it is easy, I'm still afraid I'm not doing it right. My only question is, how do I fight a boss where it's 1v1, when I have to get up close and hammer him? Do I just have to rely on healing potions? I'm about level 9 and getting close to fighting the skeleton king. Any advice would be great! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks everyone for the replies, especially fuzzybootz. I figured Diablo wouldn't have VOIP, but it sounds like his computer will be fine. He bought it about a month ago, but it's a low level g7. It has a quad core processor at 1.5 GHz, and his graphics card is an AMD Radeon HD 6520g. My small amount of knowledge tells me he will be fine, but I've never actually ran a weak computer, as I've only owned the one I built specifically for being awesome.

Another question if you don't mind:

* On classes... I don't want to match my friends, and one is sure he will be a wizard. I like the monk if I can't play Wizard, but he looks like he can be boring. What do you guys *think* I should play as, since I know no one has played these specific classes yet?

(More background, I play a mace and shield wielding Nord and a dual-wielding Argonian assassin on my PS3, and I played a High Elf mage on PC and a healer for a month on WoW. So I pretty much like any class so far.) </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hey everyone, I'm new to r/Diablo, Diablo in general, and really Reddit in general, and I was hoping you of the community could give me some pointers. I would have been eight when Diablo 2 came out, so my parents never let me play it. Now that I can make my own adult choices, I'm picking up Diablo 3.

My questions:

* What quick info should I know about the lore of Diablo?

* What voice communication system do we use?

I like Skype, but I'd prefer an in game system if there is one, so my friend's internet/processor aren't affected.

* Does Diablo demand much on lowest settings?

My computer will run Crysis on max, so I'm not worried, but my buddy's laptop isn't very powerful. I just want to make sure if he has to use Skype, his processor won't be too bogged down even with Diablo at it's least. He is also afraid it won't run it. Our fingers are crossed.

* Will this game be worth it for me?

I know you are all Diablo fanatics, being that you're here, but I hate wasting money, having so little of it and all. I play Battlefield 3 religiously, Skyrim just slightly less, and I own every Pokemon game (that's just to brag, not to show my gaming style). Played WoW for a free month, liked it, but couldn't afford the subscription.

Thanks in advance for any good replies. I want to be ready in exactly 12 hours. haha

Edit: Formatting! Thanks fuzzybootz! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Part of Jesus's message was revoking the false-preaching made by the Pharisees at that time. Man had created a right-and-wrong separate from what God initially told them. The religious leaders at the time (not much unlike Catholic priests today) were far from what God was about, and Jesus came to abolish that false-Church. When the description refers to "the differences between Jesus and false religion," it isn't saying Christianity (the Jesus part) is better than other religions, it is referring to Jesus calling out, so to speak, the Pharisees on their falsehoods. They put themselves in places of "God-appointed" power, which was false. 

The definition of religion is what is becoming confused here. And when he says he loves the church, he is saying he loves the idea of what church is supposed to stand for, like unity through faith, or allowing anyone in (Jesus was around the "bad" people more than the "good"). Church in our time has again fallen into a man-made invention, interpreting the Bible in such a way that says we should be against gay rights, etc. Christianity is the following of Christ, but the Christianity he is calling religion is the term man gave to the religion they follow, which has fallen away from the path that leads towards Jesus.

tl;dr - Definitions are getting mixed up, and mixed together. Be careful of that.

IAmA Christian Scientist, but I'm no theologian. This is how I interpreted the video myself. I'm not claiming that I'm right, since I'm obviously quoting the Bible, a book most of you believe is nonsense. This is the logic that makes sense to me. If I said something that doesn't make sense please pick it apart. I'm new to reddit and I'm trying to find welcome here in /r/atheism even with the beliefs I hold. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> And in that respect, I think we should realize that the devs do have a vision for the game, and, because they opened up a suggestions section on their website's forum, that they would probably love suggestions. And surely they can sort through the good and bad ones. Trust me, I've read almost every suggestion, and many are too much; they'll see it the same. </TEXT>

If you're talking menu, as in the music that pops up whenever you pull up the menu, it would have to be fast and noticeable like everyone is saying, because the menus probably won't spend too much time on screen. </TEXT>
