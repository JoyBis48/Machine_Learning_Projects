	<TEXT> I get that too. I'd stumble on a subject in the Internet, like for example Zero-Point energy. Then later that same day, Im talking to friends then someone else brings up the subject of infinite energy...and I just reading about it earlier that day.
It's rare thing that happens. It still happened enough times to make me reconsider, how can this all be possibly just mere coincidence?
This phenomenon baffles me.
Is there any explanation to this? </TEXT>
