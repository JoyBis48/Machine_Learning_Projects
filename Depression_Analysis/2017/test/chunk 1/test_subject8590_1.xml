	<TEXT> Okay, it's my first time ever taking Adrafinil. I have looked up dosages and stuff but nothing says anything about first timers. I capped my own powder, just 2 caps, both were 600mg. Is this too much for a beginner? Any help is appreciated!

I weigh 122 lbs or 55 kg. If that helps at all. </TEXT>
