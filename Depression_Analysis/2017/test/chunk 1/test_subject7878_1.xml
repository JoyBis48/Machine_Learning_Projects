	<TEXT> Not really, what I want and what Republicans want aren't always synonymous.

Examples:

1. Legalize friggin' marijuana already.
2. Let anyone get married at any institution that will perform the ceremony.
3. Pull all troops from any foreign country; let them protect OUR boarders, not other countries' boarders.
4. No more foreign aid until we no longer have national debt.
5. Disband the IRS, and enforce a flat tax.  It's fair.  Poor people buy cheaper things; rich people buy more expensive things.  It's fair; quit whining.
6. etc... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> To paraphrase Ronald Regan:

I didnt leave the Republican party, the Republican Party left me.

Don't get me wrong, I can't STAND Democrats, but I've slowly started hating Republicans more and more since I turned 18 back in 1999.  They're all talk, and no action.  The "Republican" candidates that do get into office are so middle-of-the-road, that nothing happens.

I think I will now consider myself a Conservative Libertarian.  Screw the (D)/(R) parties.  I'm sick of this crap. </TEXT>

Kanye = listed as being able to play "keyboards", "sampler" (not even an instrument), "percussion", and "sythesizer".

Beck = listed as being able to play "guitar", "keyboards", "bass", "drums", "harmonica", "percussion", "sitar", "banjo", "slide guitar", "12-string guitar", "glockenspiel", "vocorder", "kalimba", "melodica", and "beatboxing".

_________________________

I first heard this quote in the intro to DC Talk's "What If I Stumble?" back in 1995 when I was 14 years old.  I got it then, but it means so much more to me now that I'm coming up on 34.

I strive to be a good example for others, but more specifically for my children.  I try to keep this quote in mind.  Thought I'd share it in case others haven't heard it before. </TEXT>

Miller's Planet... massive time dilation. The team went down to get the information.  Notice the massive waves.  Brand gets the idea in her head to go get data and gets stuck.  CASE is commanded to get her.  He suddenly transforms into SUPER-SPEED MODE!  

My jaw dropped in the theater.  I turned to my wife, and whispered, "What the HELL?!"

Why didn't they just send CASE down?  He could pilot the lander; he could go into super-speed mode; make assessments; get the data; come back; and it wouldn't have been 28 years lost.  Maybe half that.   </TEXT>

	<TITLE> My Issue With Confession </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-09-18 08:22:20 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I was raised in the Assemblies of God church.  My mother is still a registered AG pastor, in fact.  Come 16 years ago, my parents divorced, and I backslid.  I met my wife 13 years ago, and she and her family are very Catholic.

I converted through RCIA, and received all the sacraments at the Easter Vigil Mass in 2003.  The one thing I have never agreed with, and have not participated with is confession.

Why should we go through a mediary, like a priest, when we can go strait to God, and ask for forgiveness?  Didn't make sense then, and it doesn't make sense now.
