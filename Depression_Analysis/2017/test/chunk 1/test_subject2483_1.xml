	<TEXT> Thanks for the answer. One of my goals is to bring the price down for more casual players too, and make it easy to transport.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I certainly will, it will be worth 40% of my grade for that course. Apparently, we would be outsourcing the designs to producers, so if I could be able to make several boards, I would love to give you one for free! But I just started designing it, so don't expect it any time soon. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Wow, thanks so much for the detailed post!

2) I will post pictures of the designs and specifically tag you to hear your advice.

3) Aluminium just seemed an interesting material to use for white pieces, but I will certainly think of all materials available for me.

4) I hope I will not make them finicky.

5) Yes, I will certainly make them weighted.

6) I will try to add magnets, but will not make it a priority.

7) I didn't think of that, but I will still strive to do it, but I think its not a necessary.

Thanks so much to the post. Another question, how much are you willing to pay for a chess board? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yep. I was thinking of also a way to make the puzzle pieces to click on the other side of the board to keep it together. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Four pawns on one tile? Isn't that a bit too much? Looking at chess boards I own, it seems to much. Is there any reason for your advice? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Will do! One more thing, what is the price range you are willing to pay the most for a chess board? Thanks so much mate!
Do you mind if I will be using some of your answers in my project? Just quotations. User tag could be optional. I dont think examiners will care to much.

	<TEXT> Thanks! Since I am just a beginner, sadly I dont think I will be able to pursue pieces that look beautiful like the first two links. I will try to make wild designs, and will try to make sure they are not terrible. As for all the other links you posted, I will try to do all the suggestions you posted! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Silly me, I thought I read weightLESS pieces. I was also puzzled by the idea of having light pieces. But this makes sense. I am sure your idea is much more favorable. 
However, I was curious about what you think the design of the pieces would be. Is there any style you prefer? For example, do you prefer medieval looking pieces, or maybe more modern? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 1) What the hell did I just see! Do people actually play on that!?

2) Its true, those colourful boards are plainly a pain. However, why do you want Stauton peices? I was thinking of making newer, more elegant and simple designs (but certainly not abstract pieces where you could not tell the difference between a rook and a bishop).

3) Thanks so much for the advice! You are the real mvp! I can use any material really, and wood certainly is the easiest option, but I really wanted to experiment with "new" materials, such as aluminium? I was not thinking of glass as I imagine it could be easily broken when travelling (saphirre or gorilla glass may be too expensive).

4) Will do! In your opinion, do you think I should?

5) Sounds interesting and aesthetic, but how would that help?

Thank you so much for the detailed post! I didn't expect such a great answer!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree, those small magnetic boards are impossible to play with! That is why one of my main goals is to make a chess board that would take the least space possible while not used, but explained/unfolded to be easily playable.
Why would you want the pieces to be wooden? What do you think of other materials? 
And finally, what do you mean by mountable from 4 pieces? 
Thank you for the post, and good luck in games! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey r/chess!
For a school project, I decided to design and produce a chess board (for those who know, Design   Technology course in the International Baccalaureate). I really love chess, and therefore I really want to do a chess board that will be amazing. Do you have any suggestions? Has there every been some aspects you wished you could improve? What materials do you prefer? Designs?
Feel free to tell me if there is anything you would want!

	<TEXT> Is it really that bad? I can imagine every country over states what it did (been in both UK and Russian systems, which does point to that). I wish education about WW2 could be less biased towards the home country. I also wonder how the German lessons are about WW2. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I fully agree, and what the US did was certainly amazing and important. However, it seems to me that you are stating that what the USSR (and to a certain extent the UK) did was insignificant compared to what the US did. </TEXT>

I hope this subreddit is alive, I hope this post will kickstart a discussion!
What do you think about the ECB interest rate? Do you think it will change, why, why not? Will it be affected by the QE?
Feel free to share your thoughts! </TEXT>
