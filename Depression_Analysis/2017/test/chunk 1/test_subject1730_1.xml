	<TEXT> I agree with /u/Mattykinss. Munches are a great way to ease into the community and get to know others. Most munches are vanilla type events due to their public setting. 

The biggest key is to communicate. Check out the Big Little Podcast episode on [Communication](http://www.biglittlepodcast.com/2012/07/episode-56-communication/). If she already supports you in this, it sounds like you would be able to talk to her about it and have her listen. It's going to be tough, but it will be worth it in the end. Trust me, going behind her back is no bueno. And even if she doesn't want to go, at least she knows you're being upfront with her and open about it. 

One additional thought would be to find out what kink she's into (assuming you haven't done this already) and support her in that. But that's just my two cents. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am so super excited to see this company relaunching. I didn't know much until today when I started digging. But I'm excited for where you plan on taking ABU and can't wait to see what fresh ideas and changes you bring to the AB/DL community! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've been there before! Quite a bit. Thankfully, I've gotten past the binge and purge stage but it's taken a while. I'm at the point where I'll wear (when I can), but I've realized that this is a part of me. I hid it with my ex-wife and let's just say that things did not go well when she found out. But, I wear when I can and have also realized that no one really knows but me. And if anyone **does** figure out, chances are they won't think it's because I enjoy wearing. So, I know it's hard to not feel that shame, but once you accept that it's a part of who you are, and the rest of the world be damned, it gets a lot easier and that shame fades. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would contact the company you purchased them through. Talk to customer service and explain what's going on. They might want things that can be found on each package like the lot number. If it's a good company that cares about their customer, they should either offer to replace it or offer a refund. They might want you to send any unopened packages back though so that they can return them to the manufacturer.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I love the Wheel of Time universe. You're dropped in at a cataclysmic point in the history, one who's repercussions are felt through out the entire saga. During this, the journey of a multitude of characters is chronicled and you're often found wondering if one of them is the chronicler (Loial). You follow the path of Rand al'Thor as he journeys along the path that has been set for him, fighting it most of the way. Watching characters change and grow into who they will need to be is rather unique as well and one that I love. With each character, you start to develop a bond and get excited over their victories and saddened by their defeats. For example, my favorite character is Mat ([Matrim Cauthon](http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/wot/images/3/32/Mat.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20091212050852)). I love how he's put through a version of hell and comes out on top on the other side. From the loss of memories to those becoming a great General, it's an amazing story and one that I can go back to time and time again. 

Additionally, the community that built up around it has been amazing. There's [artwork](http://seamassketches.blogspot.com/), [table-top games](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wheel_of_Time_Roleplaying_Game) (as supported by Wizards of the Coast), even [a video game](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wheel_of_Time_%28video_game%29) was created. All of which take place in this universe with an [absentee God](http://wot.wikia.com/wiki/Creator). A very real [Devil character](http://wot.wikia.com/wiki/Dark_One), even its own unique brand of [magic](http://wot.wikia.com/wiki/One_Power) which introduces even more into the lore. 

Overall, it's one of my all time favorite series and worth the time to read. </TEXT>
