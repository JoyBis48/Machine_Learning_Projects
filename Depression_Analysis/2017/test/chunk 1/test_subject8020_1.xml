	<TEXT> Ok right before I left a "supervisor" got into a fight with another airport employee and cut him with a box cutter. I was working that day but didn't witness it, I was on break. 

http://m.wsbtv.com/news/news/tsa-agent-arrested-allegedly-cutting-worker-box-cu/ngCSF/

Employees were stealing passengers credit cards out of their checked bags and using them to buy things online. FBI got involved and conducted a sting operation. Yeah, bad time for all involved. 

Employees would routinely cuss out upper management..I'm talking management coma parable to RVPs/AVPs.


Employees got caught trying to transport cocaine through a secured area and onto planes. 


You get it I think...

	<TEXT> I recently left TSA for a much better job. Have college degree and consider myself intelligent. They actually pay decent...I made $16 an hr. However, they have literally NO hiring standards besides a high school diploma. I remember talking to one of my supervisors who was actually competent and did interviews and he told me that in one of his interviews a guy told him his relevant experience was being a "hall monitor in middle school." No shit. Of course the supervisor politely told him he wasn't a good fit but management gave him shit for it and I think hired the guy anyway. Also, EVERYONE within is not satisfied. The level of incompetence extends to upper management. I have so many stories of things like this happening. They need to completely revamp this organization from the top down. Things like this will never stop. The good ole boys club was the method of promotion at the airport I worked as well. You would have guys making over 100k a year with no military/law enforcement experience trying to manage the biggest/busiest airport in the world. Sorry for being scatterbrained but /rant. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> True. She admits to psychological issues as well which probably played a huge part in it. Anyway, hope you get the help you need OP and figure out what's going on! Best wishes. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Morphine induces auditory and visual hallucinations in some cases. I've seen it first hand. My grandpa was in the hospital and on a Morphine drip...he was pretty comical. He saw monkeys in the ceiling and other obviously medically induced hallucinations. No worries. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ok the fact that you admitted to previous psychiatric care makes this story void. Sounds like paranoid delusions and/or hallucinations. It seems extremely unlikely that someone would go to that great a length to stalk a call center manager.  Also, I feel like this is a plot from a movie..., </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Sleep Paralysis   the like. </TITLE>

	<TEXT> So a couple nights ago I experienced what I think was sleep paralysis for the first time in my life (I'm 26). It was the most terrifying yet interesting experience I've had in my entire life. Basically, I went to sleep that night and woke up in the middle but I was paralyzed. I had an overwhelming fear take over my whole body as if someone or something was in the room with me. I read up on it and basically my mind was awake but my body was still "asleep". It gives me the chills thinking back on it. It lasted maybe ten seconds then I was woke up woke up and was able to move and function normally. Anyone else experienced this? Idk what could have triggered it as I have no family history of this and as I said I've never experienced it in 26 years. So random to happen now.  </TEXT>
