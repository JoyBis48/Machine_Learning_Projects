	<TEXT> That would be pretty awesome. I'll look into it as soon as I've made my way through the MASSIVE amount of books still left to add.

Also if anyone knows how to quickly do it chime in as I'm sure it will be a while before I get to it, though I do want to get to it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Do this:
Restart everything and flush your cache by opening terminal and type dscacheutil -flushcache
That should take care of your troubles. And if not, I'm so sorry, because iOS 5 is amazing.

Make sure you flush everything with itunes closed. After that reopen and it should all work. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For reproduction you are probably best going with something like blurb or lulu. Here is an example of an artbook project I just finished with a bunch of other artists. Granted this one was all digital work submitted to me in an approved template, but you can see the final pdf's, images of the printed work from blurb and how it is setup for sale (no profits are made on this).
