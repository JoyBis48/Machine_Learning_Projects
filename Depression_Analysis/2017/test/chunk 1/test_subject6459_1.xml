	<TEXT>  Yet they didnt do it last time they had chance, nor ever before.

When was this time? They've only attacked sporadically from tunnels after it was clear that the IDF is going to destroy them so Hamas won't be able to use them in the future. 

The tunnels were stupidly not taken as a big danger by the government until now. If one attack happened from a tunnel and casualties resulted, Israel would immediately invade Gaza and destroy them. They could only be used once/in one military operation.

They dont need 10 people kidnapped, they can get the equal attention by a single guy or a couple.

No, they need as much people killed and kidnapped as possible, for popularity, money, and exchanges.

	<TEXT> It was formed specifically for Palestinians because of the creation of tons of Palestinian refugees when the ~~general assembly granted Israel the land~~ war broke out between Israel and the surrounding Arab countries, including Palestinians. There would have been no refugee problem without the war.

And really, the ones in the West Bank and Gaza (especially the latter) should not be called refugees. 

1. No other population has refugee status transferred to children.

2. Those under the control of the PA and hamas are free to move around in their territory, they don't have to stay in refugee camps. But it presents a better image to the world and continues their claim, so they stay. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No, initially it was reporting (and still is) 70-80% civilian casualties,  "among them" women and children. Easy to be misled though, with how it's reported. Currently, [by the washington post](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/world/gaza-counter/), about 1/10 are women and 1/5 are children under 18. Women make up 50% of the populace, while children make up around 50-60%

Your source is the top end, the UN is reporting 3:1 or 4:1, and the IDF is saying between 1:1 and 2:1. But for now, these high numbers will be used to bash Israel as much as possible while the reports in 3 months will be brushed under the rug. </TEXT>

Unfortunately, no international news source is publishing info like this as fast or as thoroughly as Israeli news sources are. It would be nice if CNN or other international publications produced the detailed reporting that ToI and haaretz is doing, but they don't have the audience for it.

The IDF might be wrong, but there is no source for this outside the IDF anyway, and any news organization would have to source them. That doesn't answer why you think ToI is run by the IDF. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It comes from an IDF general stating what 800,000 tons of concrete could build; that is just math. Why do you think that ToI is any more "run by high ranking IDF members" than any other Israeli news site.

Edit: ~~Since you deleted your comment downthread~~ since your comment was deleted...

OP here, not a shill. I am Israeli, and started posting when I began to be disturbed by all the shit that gets posted here. I'm actually a leftist and would gladly vote for Meretz if I trusted Palestinian people/leadership, but like 95%+ of Israeli Jews I support this operation. I will need to look at what is said about the shelling of the school and market today, as well as some other things that happened;  like the "IDF bombing" of the school a few days ago which turned out to be an Islamic Jihad misfired rocket. I can't say anything about that now though, or I would contribute to the "Israel is a genocidal baby murderer" meme here. People can't seem to understand that it is neither in Israel's strategic interest, not do they want to, kill civilians. </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2014-07-05 22:49:39 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Jesus very obviously did not fulfill the important messianic prophecies which people associate with the Messianic age. [\(A small list.\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/Judaism/wiki/jesus) The usual counterargument is that Jesus will return and and fulfill all of them in the second coming. But if I don't believe in Jesus in the first place, why should I assume this? The Messiah will be the person who brings in the Messianic age -- if he dies before doing so, then he cannot be the Messiah ([see Bak Kokhva an example](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_Kokhba_revolt)).

So can you prove from the Tanach (Old Testament) that the Messiah will either die before fulfilling the prophecies or come back to Earth after dying? I reject the validity of the New Testament, so unless you want to try to prove that first, it won't be very productive to argue from there.

	<TITLE> Question on Islam's view of Judaism </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-07-05 21:30:32 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I know this thread has probably been posted many times in the past, but I have two specific questions I don't have answers to.

1. Why do Muslims think that the text of the Tanach (the Torah, Prophets, and Writings) was corrupted? I know that there is a su'rah (is that the right term?) claiming such, it would be nice if someone could quote it. But I would also like to know how parts are determined to be corrupted and how it happened. Is it just assumed to be the stuff that contradicts the Qu'ran? [I had a small discussion](http://www.reddit.com/r/islam/comments/29de5y/islamic_view_on_jews/cik3of9) with /u/possiblea2m about it, but he couldn't follow up on the final answer he gave me, so I clarification on that would be nice as well.

2. Do all Muslims believe that the current Jews are not related to B'nai Yisrael? I was told a such by /u/Redhawk1000 [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/islam/comments/29de5y/islamic_view_on_jews/cijzcnq), but he didn't finish answering my questions. If yes, why? When did the split/loss occur? If no, why is are the quotes wrong? (I have very limited background in Arabic, so please provide translation if you can. Interlinear/transliteration is even better.)

Oh and one minor question I recently thought of. Do the Qu'ran record any prophets in the line of Ishmael (edit: besides Muhammed)? I haven't seen any referenced, but that doesn't mean there aren't.

Thanks in advance for answering! Feel free to ask me any questions about Judaism as well. 

   /May you find peace. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> My computer is a Dell Inspiron 1440, running windows 7. My computer was slowing down after longer periods of use (over an hour), especially while playing games. I asked here on the live chat what I could do to improve performance and was given various good suggestions. Now, I consider myself somewhat knowledgeable about software if not hardware (I know, I know, I lot of people say this, but I have a little experience programming), so my computer was already clean of malware and I had been disabling unneeded programs running in the background. After trying some of the minor suggestions, I decided to clean the fan when I downloaded Coretemp and realized my computer could run up to 190 degrees F even when only using internet and video chat when in a 70 degree room. After seeing this, I decided to clean the out the fan and make sure nothing was wrong with parts of the computer.

I watched a video on how to disassemble the parts, and it was a great learning experience! Unfortunately, in order to access the fan, I had to take out the motherboard as well instead of just the keyboard and outer case. The fan was indeed dusty, though not quite as bad as other pictures I looked at online. I cleaned the fan using a small vacuum and cloth, cleaned the motherboard of dust with compressed air, and wiped down the non-electrical parts of the computer. I made sure I was very careful, remembered where all the parts and wires connected, and kept track of all the screws and various other parts while taking the laptop apart and putting it back together. The only part I know I might have made a mistake on is the order of the two large chips in the bottom of the computer (Maybe the RAM? I don't know what they're called...taken out at 1:05 on this video:  www.youtube.com/watch?v=ulecDVBnDwc. Would switching them actually change anything?)

Now my computer turns on, but the screen stays off and after about a minute it starts beeping 4 times in a row every 5 seconds. What could I have done wrong, and what are my options now? I did a full backup right before disassembling, so worst come to worst I guess I'll have bring it to a repair shop and they could fix it and wipe it. Any advice for me, r/techsupport?  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Why is Jesus different? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-07-03 00:53:10 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> A common argument I've seen for the validity of Jesus as the Messiah is that he was unique in certain respects. Usually, the twin claims are that he committed no sin and that he performed many miracles, including raising himself from the dead. Putting aside the former claim, (because of the unverifiable nature and that there is no reason for a Messiah to be sinless), why do the miracles make Jesus unique. The Bible clearly states in Deuteronomy 18 to be vigilant against false prophets who will turn people away from the proper worship of God. These prophets will "perform signs and wonders" to prove themselves, and God tells the people not to trust just because they perform miracles.

So why are Jesus' wonders used so often as proof of his status as the Messiah/divine? And are there any other reasons to believe that Jesus was a unique human?

We can also discuss the sinless claim if someone brings a verse to show the Messiah must fulfill that requirement. Please don't bring into the argument that he was God as well, because not only is that impossible to argue about, it doesn't answer my question. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was a really big Pokemon fan when I was younger. I played the first and second generations to death, starting multiple games over again so I could experience the thrill of training my pokemon from scratch and beating all the gyms for the first time. I then tried my hand at emerald for a it after it came out, but for some reason I couldn't really enjoy it and stopped after a while. I did the same for Pokemon black, and even almost made it up to the Elite Four, but I didn't understand a lot of the new pokemon, moves, or any of the background stuff. 

I just got a 3DS and a copy of Pokemon X for my birthday, and I want to play and understand, and enjoy it! I'm really excited about the new generation since it seems really immersive. I'm not really interested in the competitive scene nor spending hundreds of hours breeding the best pokemon, but I do want to know how to better train the ones I catch! 

So what's new? What are EV's, how do battles with multiple pokemon flow, did B-down to catch a pokemon ever actually work (I'm still going to use it anyways!), etc. Educate me, please! </TEXT>
