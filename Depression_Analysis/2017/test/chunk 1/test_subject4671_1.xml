	<TITLE> How do you Increase Protein and decrease carbs? </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hey all: this is my second week of p90x. For the first week i just took a normal diet and put it through loseit.com just to see what my percentages were. I roughly averaged 40% carbs, 30%protein, 30% fat. Obviously the p90x fat shredder is 50% protein, %30 carbs, 20% fat. So how do i bring up that protein number in some practical ways?

Here is a sample day of meals for me:

* Breakfast:oatmeal
* lunch:ham and turkey pita with provolone cheese/baby carrots/and grape tomatoes
* dinner: white bean and garbanzo bean chicken chili(over minimal rice)
* snacks:almonds(roughly 20 throughout the day), spinach shake(this is my recovery drink: 1 banana, 1 scoop protein powder, 1.5 handfuls spinach, 1/3 cup almond milk, 2 tbs peanutbutter, ice)

also what do you look for in a protein bar? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey, I'm also am doing the program(today is my day 6) and I wanted to give you some tips. 3 pushups doesn't seem to be a lot. I would consider doing 10 but moving to your knees if you have to(this is what i do). Anything less than 10 and you will be resting too much and stiffen up. Also with the chin ups try to do negatives(use a chair or jump up to where your chin is above the bar and then release as slowly as you can) </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  you should a)have scouted the 4 gates+robo(i think standard scan of your opponents main is around 6:30ish) b)still be able to hold it off(if you are constantly producing out of 2 rax(bc 3rd rax is getting an add on) you should have enough to hold. Plus your opponent is incredibly all in at that point(he can kill 10 of your scv's and it wont matter bc you have two base down). Use the scv's to soak up damage(right click autorepair when you pull them so they soak up even more damage). You should be able to hold. </TEXT>

Also, he seems to do well at MLG's beating players like Slush, Tyler, etc. He also keeps a pretty good schedule of streaming often.

	<TEXT> Hi! i'm a gold level Terran and i've been dominating TvZ using the MVP build. Here are some quick notes.

1.)you didnt expand fast enough. Using this build you should be able to throw down a little bit after you start producing Helions.
2.) only produce 4 helions. This is the amount you need to get map control. Remember, the MVP style is about not taking damage and controlling the map instead of causing damage via drone harass.
3.)Once you switch your 1st factory to a tech lab. throw down gas #2 and factory #2. I prefer getting  an early siege as opposed to stim since the MVP build has no medivac usage...you actually hurt yourself with stim.
4)as soon as your second siege tank finishes, float your orbital down to expansion(circa 7-9 minute mark), transfer scvs, build gas 3 4(2 workers in each), and throw down engineering bay for upgrades and turrets to defend mutas.
5.)now you can actually afford the 4 marines/2 seige tank/ 2scv/supply depot production you were trying to pull off. 3rd goes down around 11 minute mark which should also be when you make your first push. Keep marine behind siege tanks and have your tanks hot keyed to go into siege mode. AS SOON AS YOU SEE creep, seige up and take out 3,4 tumors. 

Thats all i can think of now. I may download a replay for you to see of me doing the build. Also, if you want to practice i play zerg as well test_subject4671.465 </TEXT>

	<TEXT> hi all! gold level terran here. I'm struggling with the tvt match as i feel i really dont have a solid build or key idea. In silver league i could just mass marine marauder and get my upgrades to +3/+3 by the 16 min mark and win. Now in the gold league, other players macro is better and there is a significant use of siege tanks. I've been opening with a fast banshee build order:

10 supply
11 rax
13 gas
15 orbital
as soon as i have 100 gas-factory
once factory completes throw down reactor and starport
once starport finishes switch onto reactor...keep producing marines/tanks and expand...the problem is that even if i do damage (6 scvs) my opponents seem to be able to attack me and kill me.. any suggestions? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Lower Leagues underrated?? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2011-10-02 16:03:47 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hey everyone,

I keep reading posts here that say "blah you are only silver league, all you have to do is have good macro and you advance." With that said I'm currently sitting on the silver/gold cusp and i disagree. I'm doing builds versus each race(2rax vs z, 3rax stim mm push, fast banshee) and executing them really well and most people hold these off. I then proceed to have a 20+ minute game where the only time i get over 600  minerals is when i max(600 because two factory thor). So what's your opinion? do we not give the lower leagues enough credit?

EDIT: I'm not saying i'm the best..i'm merely asking if we give the lower leagues credit :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> hmm...maybe i'm too into soccer to be a good evaluator of this fact. I do know that ever Sat and Sun ESPN2 shows an EPL game. But i agree that soccer has a much larger following than SC2. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> sports like soccer have 45 minute halves with no adds at all. They simply state "this match is brought to you my gatorade" or something like that. I could see it being the same. </TEXT>

Anyways..I'm really struggling vs protoss...i find the other matchups easy...but i literally can not figure out for the life of me how to stop 4 gate pushes...bunkers near the front of my base? they warp into the back..mass marauders-killed...mass marines-killed....rushed to tanks-killed...help please?

Watching streams doesnt help me bc pros dont forgate really in pvt or pvz

Edit:To THose asking about warping in back...warp prism . </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Destiny advocates a one base roach push strategy to stop this. You overlord on 9, spawning pool on 12, gas on 14(3-workers immediately) as well as roach warren, get a queen, and drone up to 20/26..then non stop roach/overlord production..if he doesnt have roaches out you win...and if he does he can not stop producing them or you will win...and since you are putting pressure on you can use one of your drones to expand. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Help with Playing As Zerg </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Hey everyone, right now i'm chillin in the silver league as terran and am doing okay. learning/getting better all that jazz. The other day i started experimenting with the other races just to get a handle on how to scout them/etc. During this i found playing zerg to be especially fun...enough so that i legitimately am considering switching. My one question is how do you determine the # of lings you need to make at any one point...i always seem to make too few and get killed by early 3rax/4gate plays. or if i try to do a roach build i always get cannon rushed by protoss. I find if i can get to late game i'm beating everyone...so anyhelp stopping these early game pushes would be nice. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> honestly i was able to beat the computer on hard/very hard by just microing out marine/maruader/medivac....but that does not prepare you for the game...I think its much better to just play 2-3 games on the ladder every day...as you play you should start to notice good timings etc </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I started out just like you losing almost all my games. I quickly got very frustrated. What i found out is that i just didnt have a plan, i was building units willy-nilly and losing. I would suggest Day9 Dailies 257,267,285,and 289. But honestly the most important one to watch and digest as terran is #312. Once i watched that daily it all clicked for me. I'm now residing as a top Silver league terran who should be in gold any day now. </TEXT>
