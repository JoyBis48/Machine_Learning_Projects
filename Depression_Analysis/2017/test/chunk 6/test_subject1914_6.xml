	<TEXT> Okay so I'm going into my third year and uni and I'm moving into university housing which means living with 5 other students. now i have a problem with small talk and I'm really scared about living with new people for the first time in a few years. and this sounds really dumb but how do i create a polite and friendly atmosphere when people are talking to me i have big trouble with first impressions and small talk anyway even though i have the best intentions in mind. any tips 

P.S this is not a self deprecating post to get compliments or anything i genuinely need help at being friendly and sociable. thanks a lot </TEXT>
