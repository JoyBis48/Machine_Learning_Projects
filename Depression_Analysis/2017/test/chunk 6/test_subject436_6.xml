	<TEXT> Kind of a side question because I don't work in stem cells (although I am in biology and biotechnology): Why don't people try to replenish progenitor cells or other "not as embryonic" stem cells in the hierarchy using iPS methods? We know where many of them reside and it could be as simple as generating the cell line and then reinjecting it back into the patient at a specific location. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Also one big part of the increased survival is **early detection**!! Get screened early and most things can be surgically removed. Surgery is still the gold standard and is really the only "curative" method, but only works when the cancer is in its early stages and has not metastasized.

People might say that mammograms and PSA tests don't have much benefit and that's certainly debatable, but gastrointestinal and cervical screenings have had a HUGE effect. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think this must have been something they've been working on for a long time but put it on the backburner because it "wouldn't be worth the manpower". Something obviously changed in the last 2-3 years when they were planning the features for Windows 9. It might be as simple as a software workaround/"emulation" for drivers that refuse to work in W8/W9. Windows 7/Vista/XP have had "compatibility mode" for older programs for years, so this would just be the next step but on a much deeper level. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was born in HK and am definitely very pro-democracy, but let's give China some reserved credit here for the first few days of the protest.

If this was done in America, there would be riots, smashed storefronts, and police brutality everywhere. While tear gas and pepper spray are still quite strong anti-democratic weapons, the amount of restraint by the HK police is phenomenal so far. **There has not been one single gunshot.** Remember, there are probably over 10k people sitting on that little strip and nobody has died. I realize that the bar for police civility is quite low, but they have managed to exceed my expectations.

Just remember what was happening in the Ukraine and during the Arab Spring. I have to commend the HK protesters for keeping disciplined and non-violent, and the HK police for not shooting at anyone. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Just to jump in: you're not going to find use in doing scans of single cells. This would be useless for many types of blood cancers. But it's kind of incredible if they can use this for deep tissue imaging of solid tumors. Normally they appear as a mass of cells that just look pretty fucked up. This easily identifiable for a pathologist but kind of hard to do during surgery.

As far as I know, in a typical oncological surgery operation, what they think is the tumor + buffer room is excised from the patient. At that point they will take sections of the ends and quickly make sides for a pathologist to examine *immediately*. They keep cutting until they find nothing.

If this technology could speed that up while having no loss or even an improvement in sensitivity, then it is a big deal. </TEXT>

Apple is doing some terrible PR. Jobs isn't here any longer so saying that the problem doesn't exist or to minimize it by saying only 9 people have complained is a terrible tactic. You never confront the issue by denying theres a problem, especially because there's something that customers can obviously see on the internet that is the opposite. Similarly with the antenna and maps: just acknowledge that some people may have problems and sweeten the deal with a case with no questions asked. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Do you seriously think that China and Britain are on equivalent levels here? One of these countries has an established rule of law (including courts, an efficient police system) and constitution upon which HK based all their laws. Mercantilism and the finance industry boomed in HK largely because of the British. You also have property rights and healthy private businesses.

In China you have no freedom of speech, a censored internet, a farce of a court system, barely any private property rights, and a business culture where the only businesses that succeed are government spinoffs.

Sure, there are problems with Britain and were problems with their rule pre-1997, but it sure as fuck was better than having China look over your shoulder.

Although I may be biased, because I'm from there. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Don't worry, China's not stupid. If there ends up being any deaths of these students, the Chinese government will execute those officers involved. If not, the HK population will riot and fuck shit up. We're talking about 7 million people in densities higher than NYC.

FWIW, people in HK do NOT see themselves as part of the mainland. There is a huge nativist/xenophobic/"nationalist" sentiment against mainland Chinese, who are easy to identify because they speak only Mandarin. Their only legitimacy in HK is because of an agreement that HK will keep its government and that the Basic Law will be enforced.

HKers are also much more affluent and educated than other minorities in China (eg. Uighurs, etc). Classical oppressive tactics are not going to work here, and China realizes that. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Don't worry, that won't happen. China knows they are walking a very fine line. As soon as there is violent suppression of the protests they will lose all legitimacy on the island and it will spiral out of control. Contrary to what everyone else sees, China only has tenuous control of the entire country so long as economic conditions are growing. That's why they are so worried about a slowdown in growth (even if it's at 7%!!! this year). 

In Hong Kong, you have 90% of the population that is essentially nativist/"nationalist" against outside influence. The only reason why China hasn't seen more resistance is because they agreed to the "don't fuck with us and we won't riot" treaty in 1997. If this escalates to violence, you can't stop 6+ million people from throwing out the government. Once this starts, you know that other large cities will start to push back.

Also keep in mind that by and large HK is much more affluent than the rest of China. They aren't bound by the same economic social contract. They are genuinely concerned for their rights, as opposed to many mainland Chinese who will put up with a lot of oppression for economic growth.

	<TEXT> I think that's a little optimistic about Amazon. They might not go bankrupt or disappear, but they could become a shadow of their current selves. 

As an example, Dell and HP were in a race to the bottom for prices as well as fighting tooth and nail for razor thin margins. The economic downturn and progressively cheaper components was really bad for them. 

For Amazon, if their margins are steadily decreasing because of the simultaneous decrease in the cost of infrastructure and hypercompetition in pricing, then at some point it becomes very difficult to keep yourself afloat. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A lot of people complain that H1Bs prevent hiring of American software engineers. The problem is that companies like Google, Microsoft, and Facebook doesn't just want to hire any asshole that comes out of college. The H1B is a nice mechanism because it expands your labor pool to the entire world!

Think about it this way: if you are a multi-billion dollar company hiring for an entry-level coding position, would you hire a foreigner or a college graduate if their coding expertise was just mediocre? You would definitely hire the first one if you could pay them less and given all other things are equal.

The interesting part is when you start getting to the really skilled workers. If you are looking for a very specific skill set, why would you only look in the American pool? For some reason people only think India or China, but there are tons of very skilled workers in Europe that companies would like to bring here. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Python's a tricky one to learn because there's not a specific coding dogma (as compared to C++, that is). I had formal education in C/C++ and a few other low level languages, and the one thing that I was taught was that there was a specific "style" that has a little bit of wiggle room to account for different best coding practices in different coding shops. Python is really expressive, which means that while it's easy to read what's going on (and easy to do "elegant" "one liners"), it has the side effect of being able to put in a lot of personal style into the code which makes it much harder to learn if you're a newbie. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think you should modify that last statement: it could be very well that some human ancestor and chimpanzee ancestor (that have diverged from our common ancestor) were competing for the same resources, but that either (a) the human ancestors were more successful and contributed to reduced resource availability for chimpanzees and leading to their aggressiveness, or (b) the competition between species made them naturally more violent.

On the other hand, it is very possible that the great ape ancestor was very violent and that bonobos and humans acquired mutations that reduced it but not in the chimpanzee. It's known that pair bonding and other adaptations in humans made us much less violent (even though we're still pretty bad), and it's likely that the bonobo's lack of aggression in community living has a genetic component. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This rationale is good in theory. But in practice it is not uniformly applied. See Bowe Bergdahl and other POWs. Many of them have no special intelligence value, and yet the US goes to extreme lengths to get them back (eg. prisoner swaps). 

This implies that soldiers are worth more than reporters and civilians. Even ones that royally fucked up and walked off a base. Think about that for a second. </TEXT>

Even if the US completely obliterates ISIS, there is no way they can arm Syrian rebels with enough firepower to take out Assad on their own.

	<TEXT> Canadian here. 9/11 happened on the first or second week of my first year in University. I remember going down the stairs for class and noticed everyone glued to the television screen in the lounge. For the rest of the day I thought "Welp, this is WWIII" because (as far as I can remember) we had no idea who was responsible and I just assumed it was another country.

Then a few weeks later the US invades Afghanistan, I remember thinking "how did they figure that out so fast?" I thought it was a little rushed and somewhat drastic to be invading an entire country for a terrorist attack. I held out hope that something good would come out of it. When they invaded Iraq a little while later I was thinking "wait, what's happening here?" I held onto hope that they would at least be able to build a proper state, but I guess the jury's still out on that. </TEXT>
