	<TEXT> Mechanical. 

I work as an electrical designer (under an engineer) and we do commercial design work for architects. We deal with several disciplines. The mechanical subs appear to always get their units and spec data directly from a manufacturer instead of doing it themselves.

Not to mention they get us the electrical data the day before the job is due. HVAC is a HUGE percentage of electrical load. We do most of the actual engineering right at the end. </TEXT>
