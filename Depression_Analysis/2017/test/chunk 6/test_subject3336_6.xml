That paint will give give a better picture of real world conditions.  
Wind tunnels have streamlined flows and is limited by the model size and wind-speed generation.  
when you have a car testing out on a track you'll get more accurate flow patterns(especially turbulent nature), i hope they record the footage because that's the way you can infer the data you gain.  

For eg. on the front winglet side below CNN [3rd pic](http://imgur.com/a/CwxBt) you can clearly see the 3 vortex shapes

	<TEXT> i think MS is quite happy with its ClearType Tech. Its sucks on the desktop for me but i do like it on WP. Very Crisp and sharp.  

The Font scene is patent ridden. We would have had better than Apple level font rendering on Linux and elsewhere but sadly some patents still [remain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subpixel_rendering) and hinder progress.  

But as always workarounds are possible on Linux with:  
[Infinality](http://www.webupd8.org/2013/06/better-font-rendering-in-linux-with.html) and [Freetype-freeworld](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fedora/comments/12jetj/you_dont_need_infinality_for_pretty_text/)

	<TEXT> Thanks a lot for the info :D  
i was surprised when the i noticed the difference between Beta   Nightly.(Logged into Windows 7 after several months).  
My laptop uses Hybrid Graphics(Optimus) - Nvidia GT525M and Intel HD3000  
My laptop's graphics drivers are updated as per Dell's site.  
The Intel website asks me to use the manufacturers driver(older compared to Intel) when i went there looking for updated version, saying that some drivers maybe custom built for specific hardware. I didn't mess around with the drivers after reading that :|   

And about:support - Graphics :-

	<TEXT>  Is there no other environmental agency other than greenpeace?

Yes there are! And it would be better if we have them than not.  
Personally haven't seen anyone else take the fight ,on different issues, to the corporate giants and the Govt itself.  

 The only deep pockets I saw were of greenpeace. Chipko andolan worked without foreign support. Dont try to show greenpeace as warriors.

Yes i agree, income should be audited and things like this should be transparent; but same should be made mandatory for Political parties, Govt. Income   Expenditure along with finance listing for top organizations in the country.   
This is where its one-sided.   

 They are just a front for vested interest

Legally(Court) they haven't been accused for any mistake so far.  

 The ones which would like to keep any country energy dependent. If even govt promotes solar, they will start opposing production of solar panels.

I disagree. Every country is energy dependent be it US, Japan etc. They import resources to make Energy(Oil, Uranium, Coal).   

Yes i do agree to the fact that protest against the Nuclear Plant in the south was harsh, i personally support nuclear power, but you can't avoid a Disaster like Fukushima can You?   
Radioactive contamination has reached the shores of Canada today.  
Chernobyll is still a ghost town, the negative of Nuclear Power is still very dangerous.  
The Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant is in a region of Seismic activity, and i hope it works in perfect condition to benefit us all.  

If even govt promotes solar, they will start opposing production of solar panels.

LOL. Solar power is greener and I don't think anyone will oppose it. But yes it has negative effects too  
solar heats the region in which the plant is situated to extremely hot temperatures. Its [frying birds](http://news.discovery.com/tech/alternative-power-sources/worlds-largest-solar-power-plant-scorching-birds-140219.htm) these days. Best way is to locate it in non migratory paths of flying creatures.  </TEXT>

Transparency should be at every level from party incomes to MNC giants as well.  
I agree Greenpeace has sometimes been aggressive with Environmental Issues, but its not like they killed some big project for the worse.   
This seems a one-sided battle to crush your opposition because you can't be better.  
Deep pockets try an score a win every where.  
And honestly we need a Greenpeace or something of its kind. None of us citizens are so morally bothered to protect our environment or the way its misused by corporate giants in the name of "development"   </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Donations should always come from people who can afford the one dollar and that dollar won't impact their lives in any way.

Yes! I do wish people who could afford pay for it though.  
  
Also i believe if a game is launched and it has great reviews, people wont be put-off for doing a one-time payment/donation.  
I recently bought Limbo because they slashed prices.  
What becomes irritating is in-app purchases to unlock some special feature, it does help you but it has a bad impact on the mindset of a user and keeps them from coming back.

	<TEXT> The problem with donation is the currency conversion.  
Dollars might be good for the west and the people living there, but for us on the East say,   
India  1$=63.58 Rs  
Japan 1$=119.78 yen  
Philippines 1$=44.58 peso  

It is quite a considerable amount. In india you'd get 12-13 packs of 5Rs biscuits or 4 Packets of bread(15 Rs.)   
Most of the people here in possession of a smart phone are teens and early adults who depend on their parents to provide them with funds, so they tend to avoid buy/donating apps which cost.   
Probably once they start earning this trend could change  

I do buy games and donate if im in financial capacity though :)   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Technology wise - yes, i believe it will atleast by the next few version Firefox will come on par with things already implemented by chrome and go beyond as well.   

We need Mozilla and Firefox to exist for an open web, even if Usage etc. go down, because i don't think anybody preaches/pushes forward an Open Web like Mozilla. We had 'works on IE' before, that got addressed well and now we could see that situation rise again.  

Only when people/users make switches can the trend change for the better.  

Usage   Adoption - this depends entirely on a persons perspective. If a person feels chrome is the best thing on the planet, then you cant change him/her. Other who have a different ideology, say they value privacy or OpenSource/Standards developed software a lot, then Firefox becomes the best choice for that person.  
It really comes to a personal choice and if you're willing to make a change.  

EDIT  
Non-tech savvy people - they would be least bothered. They just want something that works.  
Only way to change them is to educate them or market better(which Chrome is all about).  
This is one crowd that has to be considered because for them defaults/ad's and marketing make it the best product.   </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [Nightly] Page Loading and Spinner Issues </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-04-29 18:05:13 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Im getting this quite a lot on Nightly version 40.0a1 (2015-04-29) on Fedora Linux 20 with e10s enabled  
"a web page is causing Nightly to run slowly. What would you like to do"  
This happens randomly after some continous time of browsing, and every tab I have opened goes white with that spinner loading icon - spinning.  
Clicking the 'x' stop button on awesome/address bar does not stop the page loading.  
Refreshing other tabs also has no effect.  
Firefox keeps showing the loading spinner in content display area.  
Killing the Web process, works but this problem comes back rather quickly  
Any solution? I've only been using facebook, reddit, bugzilla, Imgur, whatsapp web.  
Also many a time, switching inbetween tabs causes the white page and loading spinner to re-appear(This happens often).  
Tried the normal trouble-shoots i.e. new profile, refresh browser etc.   </TEXT>
