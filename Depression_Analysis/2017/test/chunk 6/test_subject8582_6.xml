	<TEXT> Panty and Stocking with Garterbelt is somewhat similar, though it's a straight-up comedy, less than it is an action show. It's pretty similar in that it's also a sexualized parody of Magical Girl shows. iirc, the soundtracks are also done by the same person. 

Also, it's not really an anime, but Bayonetta is kinda similar. You might want to try out watching/playing that.  </TEXT>

-remove that one episode where all the pointless side characters died to fill some space. (Not Kittan obviously since he was important, but everyone else)

-episode 4. Fuck. 

-shorten the "serious" arc where they were on Earth post-time skip

-maybe extend the final fight by like 7 minutes

-add a giant new form of TTGL made out of Kamina's soul

-give Yoko a Tengen Toppa Titty Tank

-maybe make it into two movies </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not an expert on the Mandarin, but from the thread it doesn't seem like a full-powered Bayonetta would have too much with him. At her full power, she took down both the god of her universe (or at least, its presumed creator) and the man who was nigh-omnipotent by stealing the full power of several gods. The only thing Mandarin can do to harm her is going to be the matter manipulation, which Bayonetta has overcome before with Jubileus and Aesir. The speedblitz could be an issue, making Witch Time a bit less effective, but in the Balder fights in Bayonetta 2 she's already proven that she can fight enemies much faster than her. 

Bayonetta wins.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My favorite character is Bayonetta. I have Counter Vibration, Wing Blades, and invulnerability. 

Thing is, my invulnerability will mean that I get a good ninety or so years to fight Bayonetta. I'm to weak to ever hope to do any damage to her, unless I was able to become a witch/lumen sage, in which case I'd eventually be able to wear her down enough to beat her. Knowing Bayonetta, there's a good chance she'd just get bored and leave before I was able to wear her down.  </TEXT>

I've only ever seen the first Die Hard, and from what I can tell John Mcclane is a relatively realistic protagonist. His feats aren't as over-the-top as, say, winning a war against an army of Candadian Demons led by your evil skeleton twin. Ash stomps every day of the week.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think the generally accepted explanation is that when party members "die" in battle, they really just pass out. Then when everyone passes out, they actually end up dying. A Pheonix Down therefore couldn't save Aeris because she wasn't injured in a way where she could come back.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'd like to nominate Terminator 3 as a sequel to T2. It's not just that it's a bad movie from a different director with a poor premise. It's that its very existence undermines the story and themes of T2. 2 was a movie about defying fate and forging your own path to the future, the success of which was unique for what is, at its most basic level, a prophecy movie. T3 tore down the accomplishments of Sarah Connor to nothing more than a setback for fate. After watching T3, I could barely even enjoy T2 again, knowing that their struggle in that movie was ultimately pointless. 

So a sequel that actively ruined the original, that's why I think Terminator 3 is the worst.  </TEXT>

From what I can gather, Simon is the only pilot that matters, and everyone else is basically just a Spiral Power generator. This would mean that anyone who can take out Boota, Yoko, or any of the insignificant side characters, can cripple it at least back to TTGL. But who's the strongest who's weak enough to take STTGL all the way back to five-meter mode? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Didn't Ash become homies with God himself during one of the movies?

Regardless, I'm actually going to say no. Ash has had a lot of powerful friends (just about *every* pokemon that wasn't available except by events, what a coincidence!) but he has very little battle skill, next to no knowledge of matchups (he seems to bank on Spiral Power rather than strategy). Even if Ash had all this, Mewtwo is insane during his time under Giovanni. Ash has no chance in a one-on-one, regulation Pokemon battle. Mewtwo is the closest thing Kanto has to a demigod, and no single pokemon could hope to take him down. Maybe if Ash has them all in a row and gradually wears Mewtwo down, but it isn't very likely.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'll tackle them one at a time:

O-Ren: Without the Crazy 88s to wear down the Bride, she's going to have the upper hand. That isn't to say this battle will be easy for either of them, but it'll be easier for the Bride than the original battle since she won't fall down as much. The battle ends when the Bride disarms O-Ren and takes advantage of that oppurtunity.

Vernita: We only really know of Vernita as being on par with the Bride when they both wield knives. As her weapon of choice seems to be a butcher knife, she probably won't pose much of a problem against a knife-wielding Bride. Whenever she tries to parry with her knife(ves?), there's a good chance she'll just miss the parry completely and get slashed up. 

Elle Driver: This may be the most even battle. Both are nearly equal in sword fighting ability. If anything, Elle is actually more skilled than the Bride. But she wants so badly to utterly annihilate the Bride in the field of battle. She doesn't know when to hold back as opposed to going for a kill, which will ultimately be her downfall. She'll lose her other eye (again) at which point the Bride finishes her off. 

Budd: Fuck if I know. He had to resort to using ambush and we never actually got to see him fight. If he had, there's a good chance a dude with a shotgun can take out a woman with a sword. But, with her acrobatic ability, there's a good chance she'll be able to disarm Budd, which will cause his immediate defeat. 

And finally, Snake Charmer himself. He is apparently even better than the Bride with a Hanzo sword (though he decided that their duel wouldn't be very fruitful for either party). By this point, the Bride will have been worn down by her other opponents. That being said, she'll fight even harder than ever before. The fight ends similarly to how it ends in the movie, with the one attack Bill couldn't foresee: the five-point-palm exploding heart technique. He has a monologue and walks his five steps, defeated.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> However, Godzilla wouldn't have a strong enough AT field to manipulate, considering he would be Lilim. His AT field is just strong enough to keep him as an individual and not a couple hundred gallons of LCL.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Because while Germany wants to eradicate the hateful nature of its past governments, America values freedom of speech as well as democracy. The government can only do what the people want them to do (in theory). Because we have a constitutional democracy, America never has and likely never will fall into a genocidal totalitarian regime. Germany, on the other hand, realizes that the Nazi administration was just about the evilest thing they could do and has gone out of their way to stop it from happening again.   </TEXT>
