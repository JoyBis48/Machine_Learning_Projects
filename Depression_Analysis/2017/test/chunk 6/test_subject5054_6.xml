Any who, he's not the subject, focus or punch line; the morning box of chocolate ice cream is. And my first thought was, "what's that dude eating", followed by "can't be ice cream", followed by "wow it is ice cream", followed by "I should take a picture", followed by "I want some now". </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've just never seen anyone eat straight out of a big box of ice cream like a push pop, at 8:30 AM and in public. Found it amusing, no judgement.

He honestly didn't seem healthy though. He was slurring when he was talking to the bus driver and was doing what looked like the heroin nod when he wasn't munching on his box.

Could have just overdosed on chocolate though. </TEXT>

I just don't have the same quick recovery time I used to so I had to cut back. It's not a bad thing, it's just a thing. But yeah I'm probably sheltered for pointing out that you spend 1/7 days a week hungover and that's not an outlier (which for your age range probably isn't - but this isn't just your age range).
