I hope that the plane that landed by Dean wasn't actually aimed at him and was just unpredictably flying and happened to land by him (not that they should've been flown while he was talking anyway). But I think the planes can be fun if they're flown at the right times and aren't out of hand. But yeah, sucks to be whoever has to clean them all up. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The build process on my team is very student-led. I think that the thing the mentors help with the most is designing the robot. While the mentors help on some things that they feel are dangerous for students to do, they try very hard to let us do the majority of the build. Usually when you have a question, the mentors will not give you a direct answer. They ask what you think the answer is and they walk you through the steps to get to the correct answer. I would rather have a robot that doesn't win a whole lot that is built all by students than have a robot that wins everything but was made by the mentors. I wouldn't feel like I could take as much credit since my team didn't actually build it, my mentors did. Granted, my team has 45 students and with that amount of people, we can work efficiently build a robot in 6 weeks. With smaller teams more mentor involvement is necessary in my opinion, because there are less people to give out their ideas and less people to work on the robot. I think that if the mentors did most of the work on the robot, it would almost be defeating the purpose of FIRST. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have an ex boyfriend who is currently living across the country who I still try to help and support to no end and yet his friends still all hate me. He was just in the hospital, and his friends all gave up on him feeling better, and got mad at ME for staying positive and saying he would make it. Guess who got out of the hospital earlier this week? Him. While he was there, one of his friends told me "The reason he hasn't given up yet is because you don't want him to" After I tried telling him how much he was still needed and how he couldn't give up. The same thing happened in December. I broke up with him in a pretty bad way back in December and I have apologized sincerely, and I've even been TOLD that they all have forgiven me. Yet they still can't stand me and I've done nothing but try to help him and stay close friends with him. His friends are some of the most fantastic and protective and caring people I have ever talked to, and there have been times after we have broken up where I can joke with his friends and be extremely friendly, but that won't happen again anytime soon. The whole hospital situation really drew the "they really can't stand me" line, even though I supported every single one of them the best I could. We have stayed very close since we broke up, and I still love him. I don't think I could ever get back together with him though because I'm not very emotionally stable sometimes and don't trust myself with him. Additionally, our personality clashes have been really evident as of late. I'm an open book, and he hates talking about his feelings. I sometimes find It hard not to try to pry when I notice things are wrong. It caused a REALLY awful argument last month, and up until then we would still say I love you to one another, but we didn't think we were ready for an actual relationship again. As a couple, we never had those problems. If he ever offered a relationship again, I would tell him I would think about it, but as I think about it and am honest with myself, I realize how likely it is that I would actually get back together with him. Honestly, I still cry on a pretty regular basis when I realize how badly I fucked up by breaking up with him, and I was told a few weeks ago that he still kind of has feelings for another girl, and I felt really awful about that too. I'm not going to even try to talk to him for at least a couple of weeks. Things still need to cool down between me and his friends, and I think it's healthier for me to not try to talk to him. But god damn, do I love and miss him. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> [This](http://imgur.com/jTV436X) Was once a normal looking and intact big bird doll, but I took this thing literally EVERYWHERE from the time I was a baby until I was about 6. It means a lot to me because it's the one thing that sums up my time as a little kid because he went everywhere that I went, and all the paint chips and limbs being halfway torn off have little stories. </TEXT>
