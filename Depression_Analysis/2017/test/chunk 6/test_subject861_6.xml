I've played both of the games you just mentioned. Loved both. Looking at **The Testament of Sherlock Holmes**, **Child of Light**, and **The Banner Saga** from today. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Perfect assessment. I don't mind the graphics either. Graphics don't make or break a game to me. Out of the five main gaming elements, this is my order of importance:

1. Story/Plot
1. Character Development
1. Gameplay
1. Graphics
1. Soundtrack

My main problems with Fallout 1 and 2 lie in gameplay.  </TEXT>

Unless I just really get burnt out on 2, I will have to complete it before moving on to 3. I know they are totally different games, but I think that I will better appreciate 3 and NV once 1 and 2 have been completed. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Good question.

1. I don't think Fallout 1 has aged well. Had I played it in 1997, I am sure I'd be a bigger fan.
1. Little direction on what to do and where to do it at.
1. Damage seems to be so random which makes the game increasingly difficult.
1. In fact, combat system is one of my biggest complaints. Don't think it is well thought-out or executed.
1. My uncontrollable party members get in my way, get shot, and refuse to let me out of a house.
1. Really glitchy, especially playing on Windows 7.

Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed some of the story aspects and meta-narrative. Just playing it was what was so difficult. I'm afraid that 2 is going to be the same, just worse. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm an avid gamer. I appreciate great stories and deep characters. So, for years my friend has suggested that I play Fallout 3   New Vegas. I, however, have a personality that forces me to play games from the beginning. And when I say the beginning, I mean the beginning...of the entire series.

**Before playing recent Fallouts I must play through 1 and 2 first.**

I forced myself through Fallout 1. It was painful but manageable. I've started 2 but I don't know if I can physically do it. It is such an aged game. But I refuse to play 3 and Vegas without first completing 2. 

I need some encouragement. Direction. Hope. Tactics. *How can I play through this game and enjoy it but do so in a timely manner?*

**EDIT: I'm new to this subreddit and am looking for some genuine help. Go easy on me!** </TEXT>

**Altair** = Syrian (light brown in color)  
**Ezio** = Florentine (olive in color)  
**Connor**, excuse me, **Ratonhnhak:ton** = Mohawk Native American (brown in color)  
**Edward** = Welsh (white in color)

**Aveline** = Half French Half African (black in color)  
**Adwal** = Trinidadian (dark black in color)

Ubisoft has been very well-rounded in character creation and utilization. Just because they went with four men and no women in this game doesn't constitute as racism or sexism. It is all a joke. People just want something to complain about. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They are my favorite pair of jeans that I own. 

Are they cheaply made? Probably. Is the little leather label on its last thread? Absolutely. Will I have to switch these out for a new pair in a year or so? Likely. But they were twenty bucks. 

I've never been all about flaunting name brands anyways. As long as they look good and feel good, they are good for me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not completely sure what you mean by RPG. Traditionally, RPG stands for role-playing games. Bioshock Infinite doesn't necessarily fit that category.

But, I'm assuming you mean games that contain well-developed characters and stories that draw you in as if you were the main character him/her self. If that is the case, here are a few of my favorite:

* Red Dead Redemption
* Max Payne 1, 2,   3
* Tomb Raider
* Mafia
* Mafia 2 
* Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic
* Kingdoms of Amular: Reckoning

And if you haven't played the original Bioshock and its sequel, Bioshock 2, you should give them a chance as they are great pieces of work on their own. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I just finished **Mafia: The City of Lost Heaven**. It is an older game, but I believe that it has aged well. 

It took me off guard at first, because at the beginning it feels like a GTA game. However, when I got pulled over for running a red light I knew I was into something completely different.

Mafia was a great game. It was a *huge* challenge. Hardest game I've ever played. But a great story and some great characters. </TEXT>
