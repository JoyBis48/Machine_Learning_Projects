	<TEXT> People don't  read? I read a lot. Hmm... are you an educated  individual?  I don't play video games or watch  tv. Call me crazy, but I read. Read a chapter before I came across this page, actually. **YOU'RE** *JUST EITHER LAZY OR STUPID*

edit: see /r/books, people do read- 5 mill subs- it's just you and your shitty-ass habits. I'm glad you don't read, so I can manipulate you one day, since you fail to realize the readings. What you don't know doesn't hurt you ;) Knowledge for power is my motto.  </TEXT>
