	<TEXT> The flip side is most of the people that come to NYC only stay for a few years, maybe 10 tops.  Although there is a constant rotation of in/ out, the native folks get the short end.  

I told this to someone earlier, although I may claim NY as my home, home is really the people that have roots here.  Those folks likely won't be leaving this city, and it's not by choice.  This realization made me become way more tolerant of this city and of the people.  .

	<TEXT> It's not even like that.  You got a QB out there (Kap) bustin his tail and one of top threads I see is a request for Alex Smith's wins.  That's classless.  Why not put a countdown, for Aldon Smith for single season sack record?  A player that's actually on our team.  

The fact that thread got upvoted is ridiculous.  This summer alone I saw 4 Smith threads, which shows fans aren't over it still.  In fact, 1 Redditor even made the claim, "Alex Smith is still one of us"  
I question the Smith fans. Straight UP.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This coming Aug, my family has decided to do a Yosemite trip.  My 2 biggest concerns is my 4 y.o nephew, and mom who can walk but not much (1-2 hours tops)

That being said, can people recommend reasonable hikes and places to check out without it being too strenuous.  Also, what are some good hotels within a 45 min drive outside of Yosemite?  It seems as though most are inside (all booked) our they're super far like 1 hr 30 min (Oakhurst, Coarsegold). Is there something in between?   </TEXT>

Ahead in line were a couple of young grungy looking kids, no big deal.  They leave, and we're up next.  Both kids leave their ATM receipt behind.  Curious me goes and picks up their receipt to peak.  Low and behold both kids savings account was over 400K.  Now I'm not generalizing that all young cats in NY are trust fund kids, but that day confirmed just the ridiculous amount of wealth that people in NY are running around with.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey guys+gals, the California camp is coming up next week and I'm desperately in need of a costume idea.  The theme we are incorporating this year is Hereo's.  It can be whatever you'd like it to be, but I was hoping to incorporate some kind of hemophilia twist to it.  Any ideas, suggestions?   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's a double edged sword with Lee.  In all his years, whenever he's forced to play center, he doesn't do well match up wise and #'s wise.  However, stick a center next to him and he flourishes.  Less pressure off him to perform, plays decent weakside D, and gobbles tons of boards due to the Center boxing out.  I still think you keep him next year, but wouldn't be surprised if we trade mid way next year, especially if we're not doing good as a team </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh lemme clarify, an Alex Smith homer.  Are you a fan of this team?  Because the way you criticize Kaep and Harbs, why the fuck are you on this message board?  Stick by team thick and thin..But wait, a newbie such as yourself, you wouldn't know that.  

You display zero knowledge of the game, and it's obvious you can't get enough of Alex's dick.  Wait till week 3 next year when Alexis will be getting booed off the field.  I'll be waiting to hear your excuse then.  "Oh it's because the Chiefs have no O line, he has no weapons"  GTFO kid </TEXT>

folks are so quick to dismiss/disect anything that they don't feel is legit, when in fact the chef was born n raised in japan and made everything from scratch.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Good queston.  He trained a little in Japan, then while going to art school in Philly he worked at a few different joints.  But then his art really took off and stopped cooking.  

The last 3 years in NYC whenever he had free time we would get together and have these massive feasts.  His art work is just as amazing, and it shows whenever he makes food.  Inserting shameless plug [here](http://tadashimoriyama.com/) for his work </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You are spot on about a quality rice cooker.  My wife and I dropped 300.00 on a bad ass rice cooker in Japan.  Granted this thing has tons of functions, (induction heating, slow cooker, porridge, etc) but it was shocking to see how crazy in price these things get.  

On the hother hand, my mother in law is old school and uses a pressure cooker.  Her rice always is perfectly cooked.   </TEXT>
