No, we are assigning names to acts, not motives to animals.

If you have two dogs, and one is well behaved and the other attacks anyone on sight, it is perfectly fair to describe one as violent and aggressive. But to you they're not... because using those words would be anthropomorphising them.

So what's your solution: come up with new words, or pretend both dogs are exactly the same? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Stand-up comedy is a comic style in which a comedian performs in front of a live audience, usually speaking directly to them. The performer is commonly known as a comic, stand-up comic, stand-up comedian, or simply a stand-up. In stand-up comedy, the comedian usually recites a grouping of humorous stories, jokes and one-liners typically called a monologue, routine, or act. Some stand-up comedians use props, music, or magic tricks to enhance their acts. 

Their live act seems to fit this definition of standup routine perfectly. Maybe if it's a group it isn't considered standup? But sounded like the right word to me.

Semantics aside, yes, I'm referring to their live shows. </TEXT>

I'm just curious to know if they actually broke a specific rule/I'm overlooking something or if the mods are being hypocritical or making excuses to ban specific subs.

	<TEXT> Honestly, I think you're really overstating the problem. Fatpeoplehate gave a lot of people a place to go and discuss that kind of content, sure. But now that it's deleted I can't imagine the average FPH user going out of there way to post that content elsewhere. It's too much of a hassle, you will get into too many arguments and just find most of your posts banned, have to constantly be making accounts, etc. It's too much hassle and it won't even come close to what made browsing FPH entertaining.

I, personally, loved FPH, but after it's deletion I'll simply continue to post relevant things in other subs and slowly forget it ever existed. The average FPH user is probably more likely to do that, then try and 'fight the man'. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Need to sell a GoG Witcher 3 PC CD Key quickly! </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-06-10 12:55:46 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I recently purchased The Witcher 3 physical. However, as it was shipping, a friend purchased me the game on Steam. When the physical box arrived, I decided to sell it on eBay. I wrote the CD key down as I was also planning on selling it online. Eventually someone on eBay purchased it. Unfortunately, after I shipped it, they instated a chargeback. I do not use eBay often so when I checked his history, I noticed he had no prior purchases and his username was a random string. I contacted him and he responded by saying he has no intentions to send me the game back unless I pay for shipping (which he says is somehow $30).

**Long story short**, I've obviously been scammed. Fortunately, I have the GoG key. I want someone to use it before he the package arrives at his house. If anyone is willing to purchase it, I'd be willing to arrange some sort of exchange. We can work the details out, but I'd feel more comfortable receiving payment in advance if possible. I can show you the chargeback in a screenshot as proof that this occurred. I will charge you the price as per GoG in your country so you're basically just buying a digital copy of the game from me.

[Screenshot of chargeback](http://i.imgur.com/hzGTN0y.png)

Help me disappoint this scammer.

Edit: I'm also thinking of just activating it to my account and selling the account if it takes too long to sell the code. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Bruce Lee can see ten seconds into the future. Can he beat peak Mike Tyson now? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-06-06 14:47:54 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Inspired by[ this](http://www.reddit.com/r/whowouldwin/comments/38qfsi/a_person_who_can_see_10_seconds_into_the_future/)

Bruce Lee's powers work the same way as John's in the other post: At any point Bruce chooses, he can instantaneously gain knowledge of what his experience over the next 10 seconds would have been had he not used his power. He can't control the version of himself that makes choices over those 10 seconds, so he can't game the system by using the extra time to think or by using trial and error over a series of visions. He also can't use his power within his power, ie the version of him in a vision would never choose to use his power. He can, however, use his power, do something, and then immediately use his power again to see what they thing he did changed.

Round 1: Both Tyson and Lee are at their peak.

Round 2: Modern Tyson vs peak Lee

Bonus Round: Superman has this power. Does he finally have what it takes to beat Goku? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The combatants are the physical weapon users: Auron, Khimari, Tidus, Rikku and Wakka. Canon is based on cutscenes durability (eg. Being held at gunpoint was a genuine death threat).

Round 1: no magic, no overdrives, default weapons.

Round 2: Access to magic from their default paths (eg. Tidus gets haste). No overdrives, default weapons.

Round 3: One overdrive use, magic as per round 2, default weapons.

I understand the ambiguity between cutscenes and battle, just try and bridge the gap as best as possible. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 1. Because she is kicking me out and trying to keep all the things we bought together, so I would like legal grounds to take what is mine. So, ethically, she is the one that needs to 'man up' and give me what is mine. I would just like legal support instead of trying to take it by force. (For example, I paid 12k for the car, she paid 8k, but it's in her name, you're saying I don't deserve at least an even split of that amount? Not that it matters, because I'm asking for LEGAL advice, not your opinion).

2. LEGALLY a de-facto relationship IS entitled to a 50/50 split.

Under Australian Law, separating de facto couples have substantially the same rights and liabilities as those of married couples with regard to property settlements. This includes claims for spousal maintenance and superannuation splits.

So, morally, I think she owes me since she is trying to keep more than a fair share of things - after cheating on me - including personal property that I paid for out of pocket (the majority of assets I believe I paid for to begin with).

And legally, up until a year and a half ago I was entitled to a clean 50/50 split of assets and finances. I am wondering if those rights still hold considering the change in finance arrangements over the last month.

**Finally**, this is a board for legal advice, nothing else. "Man up" isn't legal advice. I'm asking about my legal rights so take your useless advice to another sub.

I mean, seriously, you want to live in a world where someone can cheat, kick their partner to the curb, and keep all their things? You want me to roll over and take it? That isn't manning up, that's being a little bitch and letting someone walk all over you. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [Australia] Everything in our relationship was 50/50 up until the last year and a half. Is it still a defacto relationship? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-06-06 03:40:27 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Basically, for about 6 years me and my girlfriend split all expenses. I can't say it was exactly 50/50, but the point is it may as well been because no one ever questioned whose money was being used on expenses. For the first few years we did do an even split, but we gave up on that idea after some time. For some periods, I was probably paying more and vice versa.

However, around the 6 year mark, we moved cities and I went back to Uni. My girlfriend got a full time job and handled all the expenses. I've been trying to find part-time work for a year and a half with no luck (truthfully, I was looking for full-time work for awhile, got a job, then realised I wanted part-time considering it would delay Uni graduation by 4 years, hence why it took so long to find part-time work).

Recently, I she started behaving funny, being generally unpleasant, and then I found out she was flirting with some guy at work. We broke up, and she's going to go sleep with him now.

The thing is: she has most of the money. It's hard to say why, because we really, really didn't keep track of expenses. I know I bought her considerably more expensive gifts over the years, there were periods I was paying more of the rent, etc., but somehow I currently have nothing. I think most of it disappeared because I was paying small bills with no income to my bank account over the past 18 months, while she paid big bills, but at least had a steady account due to working. The main expense, rent, was paid exclusively by her.

The split is $1200 in my account, about $12k in hers, plus she legally owns the car that we share.

So: am I entitled to any of that money? Technically it has been far from a 50/50 split for the past few years, but there was a mutual understanding that it was OK for me to leave my job and look for part-time work as we were trying to set ourselves up for our future, so Uni was more important (I graduate in six months by the way, what timing!). Am I entitled to any money?

**TD;DR:** Broke up with girlfriend of seven years. For first 6ish years we paid no attention to who paid for what and treated our money as combined, but expenses became unequal for the last 18 months. She now holds most of the money. Am I entitled to anything? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Half-Life 3 was a given

I don't think so. For a while, we were simply waiting for Episode 3. Since it took so long for Episode 3 to come out, people began speculating that it must be Half-Life 3, because there is no way they'd wait all these years and just release a small followup to Ep 2.

No one really knows what happened internally though. Maybe they wanted to make Ep 3, but changed their minds to HL3. Maybe there never was meant to be an Ep 3. Maybe they purposely decided to backbench HL3 to work on more lucrative projects. Maybe they simply kept delaying it for one reason or another and realised one day "oh shit, we're sitting on another Duke Nukem Forever".

Valve is too secretive and we don't know.

However, at this point, working on Half-Life 3 definitely would be 'going back' as it's a project that's been in limbo for awhile, not something they've been consistently working on. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So basically, I'm a short male (5'5'') and quite skinny (57kg). I've never owned a suit before and no stores in my area stock suits that will fit me (a blow to the ego!) but I need one for my new job. 

I decided to buy online, but since I can't find suits in store nor do I own a pair, I don't have any measurements.

So my question is basically: where do I measure myself and what are the most important measurements to look for? 

Additionally, will there be a high degree of consistency (if I measure X and the store says X is there still a good chance it won't fit due to variables in body shape, size conversion between countries, etc).

I'm Australian and looking to buy from a British website (Asos) since they seem to have a good return policy and lots of smalls and extra smalls.

Edit: Forgot to specify, mostly looking for the suit jacket as I already know my pant size.

Edit 2: Just occurred to me, suit styles may affect the answers? What would you recommend for an accountant in terms of style? Am I overthinking at this point? </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Some of you will want backstory, so here you go: Long story short, my ex-wife locked me out of our joint gmail account. There are important emails on there as well as photos of when I took out scene overseas that she claims she will be deleting. I do not put this past her. I have spoken to a lawyer about getting a court to demand she give me access, but I'm worried she will delete important emails by then. My best chance is a keylogger, although I fear they're already gone.

I understand I can maybe recover these emails by contacting Google, but I sincerely doubt they're give them out.

tl;dr: Need keylogger to steal access back to a join email account. It does not need to be amazingly discrete, she will not think to look. Just something that won't have any popups, doesn't show up in taskbar/task manager and so forth. I can circumvent antivirus software myself, but one that doesn't appear there either would be an extra bonus.

Edit: Bonus points if it can run itself at startup without anyone knowing. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Question about free Windows 10 upgrade from Windows 8 </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-06-01 11:07:51 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I have a legit copy of Windows 8. I plan on taking advantage of the free upgrade to Windows 10. As I understand it, as long as I upgrade to Windows 10 in the first month, then it's mine for free forever?

My question is, if I decide to fresh reinstall from my Windows 8 disc, say, 13 months after the free month ends, will Microsoft know that that copy of Windows 8 has used the free upgrade for Windows 10, and allow me to get it for free then?

I guess another way of asking this is: is it free forever and linked to my copy of windows 8, or is it simply free to acquire for this period and thereafter I will have to pay if something goes wrong with my drive?

I ask because I happen to be having drive issues at the moment. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> For some reason, only specific websites are loading for me. </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> For example, I'm browsing Reddit and GameFAQs flawless. I can Google search just fine and I'm downloading a game on Steam.

However, most websites return[ this message](http://i.imgur.com/NeyK7eF.png) (including Gumtree, eBay, Paypal and others).

Disconnecting and reconnecting to my Internet connection (through router settings) seems to breath temporary life into my connection, causing some (but not all) of these websites to work again - although usually they won't work. It's often the same set of websites, but not always, that give issues. It's the majority of websites that DON'T work. Occasionally I crawl to a snail's pace even when everything is working.

This has been happening for months. There are periods where it will be like this for days or even a few weeks, followed by periods of flawless browsing. I have replaced all the hardware (router, cords, filter, etc) I can and tried multiple browsers and devices (the websites that don't work are usually consistent between theme).

Finally, sometimes pages will just partially load - usually a lot of text on the far left side of the page (basically, only the text loads with no formatting or images).

So... what's up?

	<TEXT> A master of CQC vs the billionaire detective.

**Round 1:** Bruce vs Snake in a hand to hand fight, no weapons, no armour. First to surrender, die or become knocked unconscious loses.

**Round 2:** Stealth. Batman and Snake a placed in the woodlands at midnight. Snake has his camo suit/tranq dart, grenades, guns and other gear - and Batman his suit and basic gadgets. First to 'tag' the other person wins (this can be accomplished by sneaking up on them and touching them, hitting them with a batarang, tranq dart, etc. Basically just 'get the drop'). Who is most likely to succeed).

**Round 3:** Two identical Metal Gear Rex's are on the lose, wreaking havoc. Snake hunts one, Batman hunts the other. Who defeats their Rex first? They get the same gear from previous round (can't call airstrikes in or Batmobile, etc). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's different because they were cheating by allowing an outside participant without using Phone a Friend.

If they use phone a friend there is no problem with them Googling it. They even addressed this when they replaced Phone a Friend (it's now Ask An Expert or something like that) by saying a lot of people were Googling so it was spoiling the point of the lifeline. People have done it for ages with no consequences. It is allowed. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Then your issue is with pay inequality.

Let's say in an alternative universe, Sting earns the exact same amount in an upfront payment for writing the song that he would have received in royalties up to his death in our universe. Are you still complaining about his pay being too high? If yes, then royalties aren't the issue - you just don't like the earning potential of musicians.

If no, then your point doesn't make sense.

You're literally just disliking a specific form of compensation. Removing this option will have serious consequences on the economy, potential business contracts, copyright law, etc. Hell, royalties are also really aren't that much different from rent. You make something, then you live off that investment. I guess renting houses shouldn't be a thing either.

	<TEXT> For Glory in general at that. I might be wrong, but it seems to be the consensus online that For Glory, particularly 1v1, is bad.

It seems odd to me, considering this is typically considered to be the 'competitive' mode. You don't see people complaining about standard layout Chess matches being bad because of tryhards, etc, and advocating for random starting positions or other variations that often.

Not many people want to see games like Dota 2 or CS:GO become casualised.

So why does Smashbros draw so much ire towards it's For Glory modes? </TEXT>
