	<TEXT> After numerous setbacks, the Great Wall of Liechtenstein is halfway to completion! Only the actual structure is halfway complete, the defenses and enforcements will take longer. The wall is expected to be completed in February of 2030. For now, the parts of the country that remain wall-less will be defended by a sturdy white picket fence. That is all.

	<TEXT> Today, Liechtenstein and France are proud to reveal the newest addition to their arsenal of military vehicles, the AT-23 Spectre. These lightly armored vehicles are capable of conquering even the roughest of terrain at a moderate speed in any weather. With brand new tire, shock, and suspension technology, this vehicle can go through much rougher terrain for longer periods of time than the older models. This vehicle will be able to hold up to 7 people, can support weapons attachments to the top of the vehicle, and is prepped for all environments. Liechtenstein is currently ready to mass produce and export to any country with any specifications. Average price per unit will be ~US$600,000. Currently only Liechtenstein and France hold the rights to build the AT-23 Spectre. </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2014-05-12 05:06:50 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Welcome to your yearly programming of Hchste Kaiser's Word 2021! We're your new news team!

To start things off, the reason why we're here. At the beginning of the year, our great leader personally executed the previous mess team upon finding evidence that they were leaking confidential information to the terrorist organization that was attacking the country and other nations. He ended the executions stating that betrayal will never be tolerated.

On a lighter note, Liechtenstein announced the plans for its very own car company this year! So far all we know is that Kaiserwagen will be selling all over the world and will include cars of all types.

Next, the terrorist organization that had been attacking innocent civilians and government facilities has finally been out down. A defector informed The government of the organization's location and, upon further investigation, SHIT squads were sent in and all terrorists were either killed or captured. The next month after questioning, all captured members were personally executed by Hchste Kaiser /u/test_subject7429. The organization's leader was never named.

Continuing military news, the government revealed its intentions to design and mass produce a new military all terrain vehicle. The vehicle is being designed in collaboration between Loechtenstein and France and is expected to begin mass production within this next year. Designs have yet to be released.

On a much sadder note, our great leader revealed that he had, until recently, forgotten his own title. And then, to add insult to injury, Hchste Kaiser offered diplomatic relations to a leader that was no longer in power. The whole country joined our great leader to wallow in depression for a few days.

Well, that wraps it up for Hchste Kaiser's Word, your only choice in Liechtenstein news. Tune in next year.

Along with the vehicles, Kaiserwagen will be researching a new form of tire that will be more durable and last much longer in the rough terrain.

After the capture of their leader and the disbanding of the group, they were kept away from the public and questioned for just over a month. Early this morning, a verdict was reached and it was announced that they were all to be executed. At noon, all men, looking battered and beaten, were lined up and, one by one, shot by our eternal leader. The final execution was that of the organization's leader. His name was never released to the public. Hchste Kaiser explained right after executing the man that his name will never be public knowledge because, "He did not deserve the satisfaction of a legacy." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It is with great joy that I personally announce the end of the never-named terrorist group that attacked facilities and civilians all over the country. With the help of a defector from the group, we located their base of operations and SHIT squads were immediately sent in. The group was found to be much smaller then we had anticipated, just over 50 members. 

SHIT squads were met with gunfire upon entry and the majority of the group was killed in the ensuing firefight. The remaing 17 members, the still-anonymous leader included, were captured and taken to an undisclosed location for interrogation. Once questioning is through, punishment will be dispatched posthaste. Terrorism and betrayal to the nation won't nor will it ever be tolerated and the punishments these men receive will be just and deserved.

I personally invite all citizens of our great nation to celebrate with me. On this momentous day, a group of murderers was put to an end. Finally, we can rest and our country can return to the prosperity it knew before.
