	<TEXT> I know a person who will be looking for a roommate come August or September. Who loves reading, Netflix, knitting, and art; and who's boyfriend loves tabletop gaming, lol. House will be with two other people in their mid-late 20s, 1 male, and 1 female. You will have your own room, and possibly your own bathroom. How do you feel about dogs? </TEXT>
