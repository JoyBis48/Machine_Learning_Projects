	<TEXT> Trying to find a reputable supplier who may still have Sony VTC4's in stock, can anyone point me in the right direction?

If not can anyone recommend an adequate substitute?  


Cheers </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The shift work sucks, going from day shift to nights then back again. Also working weekends sucks. But its worth it with a little boy on the way ill have plenty of time to spend with him.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Again it depends on the trade, I'm a fitter and turner working in maintenance. Im on a 12 hour rotating shift roster (days/nights). Rostered on for 12 days a month. Pretty good money (between 80k-110k depending on overtime) with plenty of time off. Can't complain.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Last sunday while I was working night shift we had a pretty big lightning storm pass over Melbourne. Now I love watching storms, so I thought id climb to the top of the highest point of the factory which is basically a big tank used to store recirculated water from the plant. 

So here I am, relaxing and enjoying the view for about half an hour when I look around and realise the reason I have such an awesome view is because im at the highest point in a 2 km radius.

 Yep, sitting on top of a huge metal frame thats supporting this tank, in a fucking lightning storm. 

Now i don't exactly know,  but that could be considered pretty fucking stupid.  </TEXT>

This is my mum, she has not been dealt the greatest cards in life. Although she worked her arse off as a single parent working her way through university while raising 3 kids.

 Her passion in life was nursing and was on her way to becoming a midwife. It was all taken away from her due to a debilitating injury at work that left her unable to go on with her career. After the accident and unavoidable surgeries that followed, she was left with a difficult battle with depression and other medical issues that really impacted negatively on her way of life. 

Now because of her previous qualifications (which are now usless to her) she is unable to qualify for government funding or assistance to help pay for a course to be able to return to work and generally improve her life. 

She was always worked so hard and selflessly for my siblings and I and I just want her to be able to do that. So please, if you could take a minute to have a look and help an amazing person out of a shitty situation. 

Thanks </TEXT>
