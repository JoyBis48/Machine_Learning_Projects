	<TEXT> I think that what their demoing is quite impressive... But I honestly hate this design. The page loaded *incredibly* slow for me, and kind of jacked up my browser. On re-sizing, the site entirely reloads everything. 

And also, what the crap is the deal with that map? It's a UX nightmare. The scroll bar disappears? I can't scroll up? I can't scroll down wtf... No website should do that without prompting a user first. 

I like the mobile version much better. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A quick question for you:

I have several decent projects on github, and have been contributing to a handful of open source projects for a little while now.
I have been rigorously focusing on my javascript developing skills, and really want to get a job in the field. 

I've recently become comfortable enough with my skills to start looking, but EVERYTHING seems to require a higher education degree... is it even worth applying to these jobs? Or is it likely that my resume will get thrown into the rejection pile?

How should I address that issue? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm sorry, but 20 hours a day is absurd. How many days a week are you working 20 hours a day? if you were to work two back to back 20-hour shifts, there would be four hours of down time between forty hours of work. assuming that you slept for all  of those hours, you'd still only be sleeping for four hours in a night. There is no possible way you could be doing this for more than three days at a time, unless you are some kind of savant. 

and three days at a time would be pushing it.

Edit:
I don't want to sound like an asshole or anything... It's just, a 20-hour work day is something very unheard of, and I'm just assuming is hyperbole. I could be wrong though. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The quest is to get to work on time. You consider yourself a veteran. You've been through the worst of the bumper to bumper traffic. You have averted many crashes. You know to check the traffic report *before* you get on the highway. You have a stash of whatever the fuck you need to get through a long goddamn commute. It's been a long time on this road... 

and then one day, some teen/mother/father/asshat, driving far too recklessly decides to switch lanes too early, or to read the most recent text message, or look for a cigarette lighter, pet his fucking cat is too distracted and fucking slams right the fuck into you.

best case scenario, you're late for work. worst, you have some debilitating injury. even worst is some kind of life changing can't walk talk in broken syllables kind of thing, but even worst is that you could fucking die.  

at whatever end, someone like you could argue: well, techinically, they **were** the better driver. But who the fuck cares at that point. You're still late for work/have brain damage/ are dead.  </TEXT>
