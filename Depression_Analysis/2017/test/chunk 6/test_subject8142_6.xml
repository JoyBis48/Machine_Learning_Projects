	<TEXT> To be honest, though, even without the rule, a top 8 Notre Dame is going to a BCS bowl. Honestly a top 12 Notre Dame probably is. That has nothing to do with a sweetheart deal with the BCS, and everything to do with our fanbase. The same is true of an at large Texas or Alabama or USC or Ohio State. Financially it just makes more sense for the bowls to take those schools. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The Lout Holtz approach. A few years ago Lou was talking about how Weis would have an easier time coaching when we played at BC because he was used to playing in the Boston area and his mind would be right. He then said he always felt like if he got to coach at William and Mary while he was coach at ND, he would have coached a great game. One of the other guys called him out on it and said yeah and they would have had a Heisman caliber QB and been favored by 30 points according to you. No one could talk up Army or Purdue like Lou Holtz. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> How I foresee the rest of this game playing out: We get a TD at some point, one more FG for ASU. We're driving down the field as time's running out at the end of the game. Kelly starts calling pass plays inside the 10 and Tommy throws an INT, instead of trying to kick the FG, Graham beats us at dream job #3. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> One of the things KLM said that I feel needs to be clarified is that Tommy wasn't getting booed last year when he came into games. There were boos, yes, but those were at Kelly, for what was perceived as giving up on Golson. We'd just seen Dayne Crist removed after a half the year before, we wanted Kelly to give someone else a shot. Tommy Rees for the last 2 years felt like a crutch for Kelly. A nice safe QB that can get 7-9 wins on a decent team. Those aren't the seasons we play for though. As a student body, at least, there's been nothing but respect for Tommy Rees. Do people wish we had a better QB, absolutely, but that doesn't take away anything that he accomplishes. He's part of the ND family, and nothing's going to change that. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think the ACC is better fit. We don't want to be on such an extreme end of any votes that come down to private vs public universities. The ACC is almost tied depending on how you want to count Pitt. And academically they're pretty similar. Yes we like playing UM, MSU, and Purdue from the B1G, but the ACC does have BC, Miami, and Pitt. I also feel like for nonfootball sports it's at least a toss up, if not leaning toward the ACC. We do love our lax. </TEXT>
