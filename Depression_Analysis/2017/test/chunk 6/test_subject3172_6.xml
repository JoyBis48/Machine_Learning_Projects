	<TEXT> Maybe you're running too fast during the running parts? It's way too easy to just charge out there, because dangit I'm *running* and that means going fast. (There are involuntary physiological aspects as well.) You should be able to easily carry on a conversation while you're running. The rule I learned is, if you can't talk you're too fast, if you can sing you're not fast enough. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The best way to transition to barefoot-style running (whether literally barefoot or in minimalist shoes) is to learn the new motion bit by bit, and the best way to do that is [Hundred-Ups.](http://hundredup.com/) I do a set of these before every workout, even if it's not running, and it's helped tremendously. It will help your form even if you don't go the minimalist-shoe route. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not sure what to say except, go to a different shop. If your options are limited, look online (I think Runner's World is a good site) for "tips on choosing a running shoe" articles. Those are generally helpful.

You might see a debate over stability vs. minimalist shoes, but try not to get caught up in it just yet. Go with something similar to what you've been using before; you want to change gradually if at all. </TEXT>

It grows out of what their relationship had been like and the circumstances of the cheating, too -- solid marriage, momentary weakness? It happens.

	<TEXT> I've always felt affinity for the idea that we should spend part of our time learning and part of it teaching. So, yes.

I also think the point of the advice isn't that you can't learn from people who seem like lesser lights, it's that if you notice yourself feeling superior, you need to go find some perspective. </TEXT>

By God we're so darn proud to be from Texas - yahoo!

Even of our pride we're proud and we're proud of that pride, too 

Our pride about our home state is the proudest pride indeed

And we're proud to be Americans, until we can secede

Our accents are the drawliest

Our howdies are the y'alliest

Our lone star flag's the waviest

Our fried steak's the cream-graviest 

Our rattlesnakes the coiliest

Our beaches are the oiliest 

Our politicians most corrupt

Our stop signs most abrupt

Our guitars are the twangiest

Our guns are the ka-blangiest

Our cattle the long-horniest

Our yodels the forlorniest

Our cookoffs are the chiliest

Our Waylon is the Williest

Our sausage is the smokiest

Our neighbors are the Okiest </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Austin has two car-sharing services, Zipcar and Car2go, that have annual fees in the $30-40 range and then you pay per trip. In a pinch you can usually use one of them; it seems pricey at the time, every other day of the year you're not maintaining your own car, so unless you *have* to drive to the suburbs twice a week you come out ahead.

Another option is to get a scooter or motorcycle; you can park them lots of places on campus with a parking pass that's under $100. I love parking half a block from the library. </TEXT>

Many of the central Plains states are some combo of prairie (North Texas) and High Plains (Panhandle, West Texas). A more granular map would treat them separately, but it's not crazy to lump them together that way.  </TEXT>
