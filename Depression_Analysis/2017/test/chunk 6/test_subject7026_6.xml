	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Very simple premise, start with whatever you want, but the moment you get killed you must switch to that class and only use the weapon that killed you.  
Did you just get killed by the Eyelander? You Now are forced into the Eyelander until you die, at which point you switch to whatever killed you.  
  
You are allowed to use items that aren't in the same equip slot, for example the Tide Turner/Wee Booties or a Soldier backpack.  
  
Have fun letting Rockets kill you so you can use rockets.  
  
Also you should use the Auto Buy thing from scrap.tf before you do this, just to make sure you can use all the items you need. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> "If the Buff Banner got nerfed..." Doesn't look like a pun set up at first glance, it appears to be a discussion of sorts, I expected something about MvM to be a hot topic for that thread, but no, it's a pun.  
"Scout seems to enjoy break dancing. You could say..." does seem like a pun after reading it, but I originally saw it as a possible discussion on many things, from an SFM of Scout breakdancing to a mod to make every class dance.  
Knowing how many puns are on this sub, I saw "Why don't snipers use jarate all that often?" and assumed it was a pun.  
"The Medic knew taping together his broken mug wasn't the best idea... " is the only one I knew for a fact was a pun instantly.
