	<TEXT> I liked them too, but since the fanboy-dom died down in me since my viewing I can objectively look back and say they weren't up to par with some of their good movies. Ant-Man was good though. Just go into it like its a fun heist movie and you'll be pleased. </TEXT>

Not only that but he'd get mad if we used the term purple, he said that it was incorrect and that the correct term was violet. I always that the two were interchangable. </TEXT>
