That's the point! Southern Company isn't a common, public, or unbiased funding source. They're a company. Their motive isn't uncovering scientific truths, it's making money. (Yes, companies fund lots of perfectly good science. Clearly that is not the case here.)

	<TEXT> I get what you're saying, I'm not disagreeing. I'm telling you that you're expecting the media to operate as though they're publishing PhD's, and expecting the public to understand things like publishing PhD's. It's just unrealistic. 

The focus on the term is just a heuristic. No, it's not technically 100% accurate. No, it's not the key issue. *It's just a symbol that people can understand.* 

Having the slightest idea what you're reporting on

I hate to tell you, only the most experienced and educated reporters have any clue what they report on. If you'd like to change that, convince more PhDs to stop writing peer-reviewed studies and start writing for the public.

Something that most PhDs don't know and always have a hard time dealing with: mainstream media is written for an 8th grade reading level. 

Let that sink in. 8th grade. 

That's the standard you can to hold them to.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> the use of the term 'deliverable' in no way implies such a relationship. 

I mean...it kind of does though, if the other option is that there's no relationship at all. It isn't inherently bad, but it does mean that the study was done on the company's behalf. Which means he's not independent, and he should declare the funding. 

What is the purpose of paying attention to their coverage, when they admittedly have absolutely no idea what they are doing?

Then don't. If you demand perfection you'll always be disappointed, and you can go ahead and stop doing anything outside the ivory tower.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I guess I should have added that he claims to be independent, but if it's a study for a company in exchange for funding, then it's not really independent. Right? 

I just think you're holding the public media to a higher standard than they're ever going to meet. You can't expect the public/media to understand the details of publishing. Of course it'd be nice if they followed science as closely as pop culture, but that's just unrealistic, you know?   </TEXT>
