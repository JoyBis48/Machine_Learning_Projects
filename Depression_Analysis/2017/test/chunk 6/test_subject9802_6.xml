	<TEXT> Like, when something he says or does causes me to get anxious and I ask him to watch his tone of voice because it's stressing me out, he'll change his inflection to sound pleading/frustrated about what he did wrong, as well as gesticulate with his hands and it stresses me out more and just causes me to shut down more and idk how to explain to him that it's not unheard of for people who've suffered abuse to be hyper vigilant to body language... Does that make sense? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's weird, but after years of interacting with people, you just kind of *can* by hearing what someone says and by their body language just kind of knowing what it is they want.. Mind you, I work at a bar so I have gotten really good at remembering orders based on the "type" of person and repeating their order back to them. Usually I can remember orders for up to ten people and even remember what they got long after.... Now, names on the other hand are a completely different issue... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's relieving but I'm still pretty concerned it could become complicated. The hole is deeper than the photo suggests. It's about the size of my pinky fingernail... What type of tissue defect could it possibly be? It also looks like there is bone exposed; there is whiteness inside the hole and this hole definitely wasn't there before :x </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was living with my aunt, uncle and their two kids (8   10) when I was 14. I was recently put into the state's custody because my mom was an abusive alcoholic. My uncle and his family were kind enough to take me in. I was there for four months when in June, the day before my last day of freshman year in high school he just... suddenly froze up in his chair and reached for my aunt (she and I were standing right there talking to him as he was complaining about "heartburn"). It was terrifying; my aunt yelled for me to call 911 but I couldn't move.... That's when his sons came downstairs and made the situation even tougher- they kept asking their dad to wake up. I ended up having to take them to a neighbor's house when the EMT's arrived. I found out later that night that he was pronounced dead on the scene. The wake was very strange to experience. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sorry to hear that happened to you. The foster care system in the states is abysmal. Sadly, I understand why, though... Over worked, underpaid social workers and thankless families giving them hell. Plenty of my foster parents only took me in for the money. Glad to hear you got your life in order, though! I can say I definitely learned fast how to advocate for myself and it's worked well for me still. Take shit from no one! </TEXT>
