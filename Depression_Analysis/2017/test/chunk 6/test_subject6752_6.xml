	<TEXT> Now who is reading too much into something? All I stated was that there a different cultural norms for military people and antimilitary people and between straight people and gay people, for gay people who are involved in gay culture. I never called you violent. You seem to have your jimmies rustled about this. I'll let you go, but maybe chill out and bother to read.

Edit: if you're offended that I saw your post history, stop commenting completely. Its public. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I hate hyphenated names but don't care if a man takes his lady's name. I just find it unnecessarily long winded and more difficult to spell. Also, if it becomes like a family thing to hyphenate then you have great grand children with like 50 letters in their last name. Try writing that at age 5! That's why my wife and I didn't hyphenate but it doesn't really affect me if other people do. 

Edit: when we went for our marriage licence it was also explained to us that getting Social Security when you are old can be difficult with a hyphen and that paperwork gets weird. They suggested that we either pick one name or each keep our own. </TEXT>

Young children understand that sometimes parents stretch the truth and tell lies to make people feel good. If one of their siblings is given away, they will certainly fear it for themselves and it will cause a powerful distrust of their parents. The other child will also have self esteem issues once they find out. </TEXT>

I don't believe they are bad people or anything like that. I meant that, on a subconscious level, you may feel that she didn't love you and it may make it harder for you to trust her. Obviously she loved you or she wouldn't have had the courage to give you up to your family. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You trust your parents to love you no matter what. She already, to some degree on a subconscious level, betrayed that by giving you up and you don't have that trust. That's probably why you are scared. 

She wants to meet you. The real you. She has no rights to expectations on who or what you are. You want to meet the real her. For this relationship to work, you have to learn to appreciate one another, warts and all.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Disclaimer: this is my personal experience and it certainly varies by person and location.

The only reason a person who makes too much for SNAP to have an empty refrigerator is wasteful spending. My wife and I finally broke down and applied and were called that day because we qualified for expedited food stamps to the tune of 300 just for the two of us. We had no idea we were that poor. Prior to this, we were still eating every day. It was pasta and shitty sauce, but It was food. I do taxes for my family. Last year, my parents made 25,000. My mom hasn't applied for SNAP, though I can't figure out why, but no one goes hungry of them, my brother, his girlfriend, and what they do to supplement my wife and I now that we moved back in with them. It's about budgeting, which everyone has to do. When I was receiving SNAP, if we wanted to eat something besides pasta, we had to work to stretch that money. Yes, the day we got it, we had a full fridge, but the day before we had almost nothing.  </TEXT>

They believe that God gave you the gifts of desire and ability to help them. The belief is not that you were there by your own volition, but by appointment from God. Helpers are viewed as special in the eye of God to people who thank God for things like this, surviving surgery, someone showing up to help change a flat, etc. It isn't meant as a slight against you. </TEXT>
