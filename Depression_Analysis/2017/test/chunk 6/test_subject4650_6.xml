	<TEXT> Nerlens Noel was a big man with injury problems who wasn't going to play his whole rookie season. I think the Cavs thought Bennett might be useful faster - but he buckled like a baby giraffe under the pressure and hasn't looked remotely useful til this year. He's had a few games where he's looked like a bit of a force, he might still prove to be a good pickup for Minnesota. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You're very kind. Here's another I wrote in the same job :

My lebanese wife's shiny locks
Sprout from armpits, back, arms and her box.
Her pubes are so long
And so thick and so strong
That she knits herself into her jocks.

You might think it's strange for a man
To permit so much hair on her can
But it brought us great mirth
At our eldest son's birth;
He came swinging out just like Tarzan.

I'll confess, though, I'm catching the bug;
Even though she's quite ticklish to hug -
And the 'stache on her gash
Sometimes gives me a rash -
It's like rooting a fine persian rug. </TEXT>

-----

My lesbian friend said "I'm horny, 

But fisting's beginning to bore me. 

With five fingers up it, 

I feel like a Muppet. 

I'm sick of my bitch speaking for me."

-----

I replied "the solution is clear. 

It's penis you're needin' my dear. 

They're built for the job, 

Plus they'll fit in your gob 

And I happen to have one right here!" 

-----

"What luck!" said the lass, "I might screw you. 

I've never been that fond of hoo-hoo; 

A big pair of tits, 

They're my favourite bits, 

And most men ain't got 'em - but YOU do! 

-----

I was slightly offended, but fark it - 

It's not every day I can park it. 

Most girls aren't impressed 

With my man-booby chest 

But it's big in the lesbian market.

	<TEXT> I use a macbook i7 with 12 gb ram, a thunderbolt external monitor and a bunch of thunderbolt drives.

Mind you I only really make Web video, it's probably pitched right at my level.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For me, it was two things. Firstly every photo I saw on Flickr that I loved seemed to be coming out of the same camera, a full frame. The crops couldn't seem to keep up with the level of detail in sky and cloud areas. I'm not sure if it's dynamic range or what.

Secondly I'd bought the 24-105 lens after trying it on a full frame and didn't realise it wouldn't go as wide on a crop, so I was a bit of a drongo.

At the end if the day I just don't get the same feeling from shots taken on my 7D as I do with those from the 5D2. I'm very happy with the 5d and you can get em pretty cheap right now.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> To each his own, but I've never understood the appeal of these giant twin shock retro nakeds. They feel bargey and awkward to me, compared with the sportier naked bikes, it seems harder to get them to handle and you don't gain that much in comfort.
