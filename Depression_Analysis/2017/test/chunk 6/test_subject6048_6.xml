	<TEXT> Apologies for the probably confusing title. I'm referring specifically to Windstream Holdings(WIN). This stock was stead around the $8-$10 range for the past 5-6 months or so. I bought 6 shares of it at $8.60. Recently they spun off part of themselves to create a new company, CSAL. For every 5 shares of WIN, shareholders were given 1 share of CSAL. Now my concern is when I look at the WIN historical data it essentially has what the actual price per share was multiplied by 5. Is this normal practice? It seems like a completely dishonest display of historical data. The day I purchased by $8.60 shares it has the price listed at ~$49.

I'm new to this so again, apologies for the lack of terminology that probably led to a poor explanation. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The situation hasn't changed. If you're in a daily league he's totally worth rostering. As the season progresses and guys in this dodgers lineup start getting more injured and need more rest he'll get more at bats and become more valuable in weekly leagues. Just be patient. It's a unique situation he's in, unless your bench is filled with studs I'd say it's worth it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Avoid Young. He'll get you some home runs but he's going to platoon for the yanks. When not hitting at home his splits will be even worse. Keep in mind as the season goes on this aging yankees lineup is going to start getting tired and injured and he'll get even less protection. We're talking about a career .230 hitter it is literally a guarantee that he fades.

	<TEXT> Yeah I'd say Russell is probably the best bet out of the bunch. I'm not as high as other people are on him. Might be worth seeing the solid ss/2b that are struggling and try to buy low on one in a trade. If you're in an espn/yahoo league, Alex Guerrero has 2B eligibility and I think he's worth starting despite his limited at bats(the moment someone get injured in that lineup, and someone will, they'll work him into it every day)
