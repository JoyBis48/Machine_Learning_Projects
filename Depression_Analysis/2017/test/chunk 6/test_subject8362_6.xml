	<TEXT> Excuse me... A human. I don't see how it is fair to take that HUMAN'S life. I have been in the "young and irresponsible pregnant girl" place. Now I have a beautiful 8 year old daughter. It isn't my place to have decided whether or not she got to develop from some cells into an actual baby. I wasn't ready to be a mother, but I figured it out.  Honestly, I had to grow up quickly... But I would never go back and change it. I will NEVER agree with abortion. Sorry if you don't agree with me.  That is the joy of being a human and not just a clump of developing cells that doesn't get a say in anything. 

Rant done.  </TEXT>
