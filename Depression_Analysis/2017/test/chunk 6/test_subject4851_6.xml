	<TEXT> All the money in the world will not help. The gratification from your inheritance will only last for a while. Eventually, you will become accustomed to the affordances if your inherited wealth. At which point you will begin to subconsciously seek help. This leads to a number of issues which you will actively self deny such as alcohol, sexual deviancy, drugs, etc. 
There best thing you can do for yourself is to walk away from this person and their wealth. Or take the wealth and dedicate it to people in need, such as people who may or may not be suffering from the same advise you had to go through. This will bring you things that all the money in the world couldn't buy: genuine peace and happiness. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This right here. This is a very brilliantly stated fact. Bernie Sanders is genuine. Hilary is a product. The exact more of the same.  
If Bernie Sanders should win, it will be because more and more people are getting their information independently of the establishment media using social media instead.

	<TEXT> This is an all too familiar response from those who have been 'capable' as you say: 

"I'm a woman and a former Marine. My body is a wasteland of chronic pain, stress injuries, nerve damage, arthritic joints...this isn't emphasized enough. Sure, I did it. I kept up with the big boys, but the cost was too high. And I'm one of the ones that lasted a full,. 4 year enlistment. Attrition once women simply pass through training is extraordinary due to stress fractures, especially in the feet, legs. shoulders and back. It's one thing to last 3 to 6 months of brutal training, it's another to endure the lifestyle." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No. 
My point is that you can effectively use a tool (or body) in a manner in which it wasn't designed. This will result in damaging the tool so that it is no longer retains its original characteristics, which in turn prevents it from performing its original function.
A woman will have to become a man and give up her feminine qualities and abilities in order to achieve that. Think of the abilities of woman's physical body, not the least of which is the ability to conceive a child. 

The nature of the activity always shapes the form, so the form should clearly indicate the nature of the activity. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> "What informs your belief that if a woman is capable of completing the requirements of a job that they aren't allowed to do said job?"
- Physical differences. Male and female bodies are fundamentally different. Here is my reasoning:

Man is different from woman. Even if we are clueless as to why and for what reason, the same way you can identify the purpose and function of a tool by the manner in which it is constructed, so too can we determine the proper function and purpose of the two sexes. The body of a man is fundamentally stronger (physically) than that of a woman. This is backed up by every single scientific inquiry regarding the anatomy of the body and internal biology. From ~45% greater bone density, body composition, prevalent hormones (testosterone vs. estrogen), we find consistently one is more delicate and sensitive while the other is more coarse and hardened.

This doesn't make one better than the other, it just means that their activities must be different. In the same way that using a blade meant for cutting bread to cut steel, as opposed to using a steel-cutting blade, will permanently damage the blade. The result is that it is unable to cut steel, and this misuse damages the blade and renders it incapable of cutting bread properly. This mis-adventure results in the blade becoming completely useless for anything productive. This is the end result of this current fad of women abandoning and devaluing what is feminine in the mania for wanting to become men.

Understand that men and women are equal, but understand it correctly. They are equal in value in the natural (nature) sense. This means that their activity (masculine and feminine) are of equal importance and therefore, life would come to a grinding halt if one or the other were to become distorted or missing. But men and women are not equivalent. They can not be interchanged just because we so desire. We are subject to the natural laws that govern this world (e.g. gravity) and going against them is not advisable, and neither will it end well. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The voting bar, i think, is not a sign of agreement or disagreement with the article and what it states. It is a measure of interest or importance of the discussion is it not? This is not new, this is actually one of many such articles and news reports that are only increasing in frequency these days.
I think it is good fodder for debate/discussion. Listen to what/how others reason about the issue and not just stick to one side of the argument or the other 'just because'. </TEXT>
