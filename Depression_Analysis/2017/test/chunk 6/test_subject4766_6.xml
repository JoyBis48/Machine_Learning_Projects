Also in the new promo once again we see Dr wells confronting Cisco but under different circumstances. Maybe this explains why Oliver is wearing league gear because time changed so much that it caused things to change like Oliver accepting the offer to become Ra's. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Despite It looking a lot smaller compared to the other MCU films its got a great cast and I think its gonna have a lot of heart in it. I think the audience will really get behind Ant-Man once they see the movie. Sure it might not be a box office hit like Captain America or Iron Man but I think it will do well enough that marvel and the overall fan base wont be disappointed. I know a lot of you don't share this opinion and that's fine but I felt like Ant-Man needed some loving around here seen to many negative threads about it recently.  </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2015-03-24 02:10:28 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So when Joss signed his three year deal with marvel he basically became not only in charge of the avengers for that time but also became a sort of show runner for the MCU helping out other films like Thor 2 and Guardians of the Galaxy when they needed a hand and basically pointed the MCU in the right direction. However now his time is almost up and I'm wondering who will take his place? The Russo Brothers seem like the logical choice at this point but on the side they have the ghost busters to worry about and it would seem like its too much for even two people to worry about. if not the Russo brothers who would you choose to take Whedon's place? </TEXT>
