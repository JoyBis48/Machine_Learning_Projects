	<TEXT> Skyrim is my favourite game of all time. I was introduced to the series with the nearly equally amazing Oblivion.

I went back and tried to play Morrowind a couple of times. I hate that game. I hate everything about it. I don't think there's a single aspect I experienced that wasn't done better in Oblivion and Skyrim.

But hey, some people like swinging a sword and having it miss the enemy right in front of them 7 times out of 10, and that's cool, it's not for me though. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That may be the case, but it's still embarrassingly small for the task. The major releases on PS4 average at around 25GB, some are even 50GB! And they're mandatory installs.

Then on top of that there's updates, DLC, "free" indie games, shared pictures and videos. It all adds up.

I've had the PS4 for 2 years and I've had to delete stuff to make room for new games twice, that's appalling IMO. I never once reached the capacity of my Xbox 360 or my PS3 320GB HDDs. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree with everything you just said, have for a long time. But my question remains. I guess that's the "Greater Good" response in a nutshell. In order for me to agree with you about the problem of evil I first must make the assumption that god follows the laws of logic. and I'm not sure if I can make that assumption. This is why I can't say for sure that he doesn't exist.


Edit: I've just done some reading over at Foxhole atheist regarding greater good theodicies and I have come to this conclusion. If the god of the bible is bound by the laws of logic (and until demonstrated otherwise we have to assume  that he is) then no, he cannot possibly exist.

I guess I'm an agnostic atheist or a gnostic atheist depending on the god in question. Thanks for the education ;)

	<TEXT> Fair enough, assuming the god of the bible has the same morality most of us do, which it seems he doesn't.

Can we be sure that what we consider to be evil is the same as what god would consider evil? If god is the supposed author of morality could it be possible that if he does exist, we simply don't see that what he allows to happen is ultimately "good"? God's plan/mysterious ways etc etc.


I can't believe I'm actually arguing for the plausibility of the existence of god.

I feel dirty.

An agnostic atheist, like me. Agnostic and atheist aren't mutually exclusive. You can have agnostic theists and gnostic atheists.

You don't know if an invisible fairy exists
You don't know if an invisible mammoth exists.
You don't know if an invisible whatever exists.
Should we have names like 'agnostic' for all of these ?

Nope, because the belief in any of those doesn't have real world consequences like believing in a god does. There are laws in various countries around the world that are religiously based, or religiously inspired.

I don't see any fairy laws dictating what people can and can't do. 

Nothing can break them.

People who believe in a god would beg to differ.

Believing in God is scientific ignorance

Of course it is, and yet billions of people still believe. </TEXT>

It's reasonable to make a negative claim without evidence until there IS evidence for the positive claim

Is that not just absence of evidence though? We don't know he does exist, therefore he doesn't. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There's a difference between not believing a claim, and proposing a counter claim.

I don't believe that there's an invisible fairy dancing on your back, but it's possible to feel your back and tell there's no fairy there. If you then say it's intangible and I have no way of detecting it, I can say I don't believe there's a fairy on your back, but I can't prove there isn't, and so I can't truthfully say that there is literally no dancing fairy on your back, because I can't possibly know that for sure because of the characteristics of the fairy in question i.e. it's undetectable.

The same goes for god. If you say "There is no god", the burden of proof is then on you to prove that your claim is true.

God breaks the laws of physics

How do you know for a fact that there exists no being in existence that can break the laws of physics? Can you prove no such being exists? If you can I'd love to hear it. If you can't, then you can't truthfully claim no such being exists.

and has zero evidence of him existing

	<TEXT> Well. Someone made a claim, that claim is "God exists."

Have you been convinced that the claim is true? If not, you don't believe. If you've been presented with a claim, the fact that you don't give it any thought doesn't change the fact that you either believe it to be true, or don't believe it.

I agree that right now we can't prove either way whether a god exists or not, but the discussion is still worth having because religion is a large part of many countries, and often can have tangible effects on laws and people under those laws.

You don't have to disprove god to not believe he exists, you simply have to remain unconvinced of the statement's truth. Which I am. </TEXT>

Unfortunately you just made a claim, can you back it up with evidence? Reasonably the best anyone can say is "I don't think there is a god." Outright saying "There is no good" places the burden of proof onto you, and if you can be sure there's no god then you must have some pretty compelling evidence.

I'm an atheist by the way. </TEXT>

As Sub Zero I always have trouble with Full Auto Jacqui machine gun spammers. Sure I can slide, but I need to make it perfect to avoid all the bullets, and that's hard. Sure I can use an EX slide, but then they go right back to spamming. The only way round this that I've found is to duck then quickly step forward and duck again, inching my way towards them. I guess it unnerves them into trying something else and then FFFFFWWOOOOOOOSSHSHHH! slide.

	<TEXT> Whoa whoa now, take it Eazy-E. There's no need 2-Chainz the subject like that, and that's the way it is. I wouldn't expect anyone to Bow Wow at my feet. When I'm sitting on the Lil Jon like a Big Boi you might mistake me for an Ol' Dirty Bastard, but fear not, that's just the Ice-T treating my bladder like a Flo-Rida, making me need to take a Wiz... Khalifa.

Oh my tired Akon bones. I knew I shouldn't have been testing out my new DMX at the skate park earlier, those things are Common anyway. I think I'll give it up like I just don't care before I Busta hip or something, then my leg would get all Puffy and I'd have to put a really big Ice Cube on it to dull the T-Pain.

I went to see the Dr. Dre for a check up and he told me there'd be a Diddy fee. Which was nice because I was expecting something B.I.G.

50 Cent is all he charged me, as thanks I bought him a 2-Pac of his favourite beer and a sole Eminem, a blue one. He asked me "How Kanye be doing this for me? I'm just working my Method, Man."

I replied "Pharrell the times you've healed me, made me feel better about myself. The least I can do is Snoop around your facebook page, see what beer and candy you like. It's not like I bought you a Gucci Mane bag or anything."

And then I left. I knew he'd be watching every step I take, and every move I make, and I knew today was gonna be a good day.

	<TEXT> **What will you be doing with this PC? Be as specific as possible, and include specific games or programs you will be using.**

I want to play games that look better than on my PS4 (Witcher 3, GTAV, that sort of thing). Ultra settings would be nice but I have no idea how expensive that is, so high would suffice if the cost is over my budget. I'd also like to do some light video editing and rendering using Sony Vegas.

**What is your maximum budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?** 

700

**When do you plan on building/buying the PC? Note: beyond a week or two from today means any build you receive will be out of date when you want to buy.** 

I don't know when I'll be buying. I'm looking to get an idea of what I'll be buying since I know nothing about the innards of PCs.

**What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? (Tower/OS/monitor/keyboard/mouse/etc)** 

This will be from scratch so I guess I'd need a tower, OS, one monitor, speakers, keyboard, mouse. Not sure what else I'd need.

**Which country (and state/province) will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in US, do you have access to a Microcenter location?** 

England.

**If reusing any parts (including monitor(s)/keyboard/mouse/etc), what parts will you be reusing? Brands and models are appreciated.** 

None.

**Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?** 

I have no idea. I guess so. I thought everyone overclocked gaming PCs.

**Are there any specific features or items you want/need in the build? (ex: SSD, large amount of storage or a RAID setup, CUDA or OpenCL support, etc)**

"RAID setup, CUDA or OpenCL" I don't know what any of that is. I'd like an SSD but they're mega expensive. I'd need at least 2TB of storage for all the games I reckon.

**Do you have any specific case preferences (Size like ITX/microATX/mid-tower/full-tower, styles, colors, window or not, LED lighting, etc), or a particular color theme preference for the components?**

Not yet. Just trying to get an idea of what I need. 

**Do you need a copy of Windows 7 or 8.1 included in the budget? If you do need one included, do you have a preference for one or the other?**

I guess I'll need windows. I've got 8.1 on my laptop but I much preferred 7, that metro stuff is just annoying. Is there a benefit to using older versions?

**Extra info or particulars:**

I am a noob. Please remember this when saying things like "Radeon 9500 GTX" and "i7 quad core". </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm sure the Xbox One controllers do have a great life span. I know the Xbox 360 did, but then again the tradeoff was that you had to buy batteries and keep swapping them out when they need charging. With my PS4  I have a dock that holds two controllers. When one gets low on power I simply turn it off, place it down, pick up the other one and keep playing. I will agree that the battery life on the PS4 controllers is embarrassingly short, but 4 hours is doing it a disservice. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's almost as if the stuff bundled with collector's editions of games is cheap tat!

I remember when my Mum opened her collector's edition of Elder Scrolls Online and pulled out the statue of Molag Bal. A statue we'd assumed would have been made from metal given the price of the fucking package.

NOPE.

It was cheap as fuck plastic. I've heard the same from people with other collector's editions. This is why I don't buy collector's editions. Mostly because I don't want the shit that comes with them, I just want the game, but partly because I've been nothing but underwhelmed with what I've seen so far.

Did anyone get the collector's edition of Black Ops with the RC-XD? Or the CE of Modern Warfare 2 with the night vision goggles? what was the build quality like on those? Also the Scorpion statue with MKX. </TEXT>
