	<TEXT> Yeah? What about all the comments in other day's post about the leg with lymphedema? Everyone was reacting saying this wasn't laughing matter, that it was a nasty disease that could happen to everyone, some even insulted op for taking the photo... Don't take me wrong, I agree with all of that, but the level of hypocrisy was strong, this sub has been laughing about other people's disgraces since a long, long time. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Wow... I became a photographer because of my love to visual arts and that I can't draw even a smiley haha. I'm super glad the world has such talented artists as you.  

If you scan that, you could make it a great wallpaper. It's super super good, keep drawing and improving always!  

BTW, I got you gold, your work totally deserves it and even more. Please, don't stop drawing.

	<TEXT> Quick story.  

In 2012 new years eve a couple of friends, my gf and myself were walking home after a night out, at maybe 5-6am. They were like 15 or 20 of us. Out of the blue a car comes at 60ish MPH towards us, breaks and turns over repeatedly, hitting just with the tail one of my friends. Luckily it wasn't a serious injury (the car barely touched her) but it looked like it at the moment with all the commotion. We head towards the crashed car and got out the driver, who was a very drunk teenager. We called the cops and after they showed and took him, we got home. It was a very scary situation, we almost got killed and we returned as if nothing happened. 

But I remembered hearing the name of that teen when police asked it to him. So I searched him in Facebook, in Twitter, anywhere I could find him, with no luck at all. 

A few years later a friend and I were hanging in a bar near my home. Having a great night with some girls we met there, and one introduces us a group of friends of her. In that group was this guy. I remembered him very clearly, and when he said his name I said that yeah, I knew him, "you almost killed my friends me and my gf in new years eve". Man that was awkward, I don't know why I said it, it just came off me like that. He got very angry at first and after a lot of tension and discussion (he wanted to fight me, wtf) I told him we should drink a beer and talk privately. We did, and I said I didn't want to fight him, I just wanted to know if he was conscious about what he did that night, that he wasn't a murderer by the luck of a few inches.  

He cried and told me he hasn't been able to drive a car since, that he remembers what happened that day everyday, and that he was very sorry for what happened. I just felt that he was being sincere, so after a while I told him that at least me forgave him, that it was all cool. It was a powerful moment, I felt so much anger when I looked at him at first, but then we talked and I don't know, it felt great to hear him say that and it helped me a lot to forgive him as well. I haven't heard from him since, but I hope he stays well and that he never drinks and drives again.

OK, not so much for a quick story haha so, tldr: guy almost kills me, friends and gf in a DUI car crash, casually met him years later, tells me how hard that experience hit him and how he hasn't been able to drive again (morally of course, laws in my country sucks, as my English so sorry for that). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't care what kind of moral crusade you're on, or how justified it is, it's just weird to talk like this to someone.

Moral crusade? Not at all. Maybe it'd be a moral crusade and a bit weird if someone called them out for no good reason out of the blue, but this person is talking about becoming an Uber driver... People should know that their driver killed (not injured, *killed*) another person while driving drunk.  </TEXT>
