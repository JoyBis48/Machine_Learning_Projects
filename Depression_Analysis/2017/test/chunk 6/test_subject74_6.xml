	<TEXT> Okay, so I'm also getting an IUD at the same time as the lap and I'm really really nervous. 

So, I'm wondering what the worse parts I need to prepare for are and mostly I'm wondering what people who have been through both think in general...

	<TEXT> Cervix area, pelvic area but very deep... I've been tested for everything... Pee, blood, ultrasound... In the process of being diagnosed but my doctor is pretty confident... I'm trying to get a lap done.

Use enough lube for sure. And it hurts almost every time. It's like the worst lottery ever... Less deep positions hurt less obviously but pretty much every one but missionary kills me... And even then, still not pain free  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm looking for any tips, tricks, methods, etc to help with pain during/after sex as its a huge problem for me right now and I haven't gotten into a gyn yet...I'm on Toradol which helps my general pain but sex pain is still horrendous.

	<TEXT> As someone who recently discovered their own bisexuality I'd say its most likely him learning about himself...Its more about discovery and exploring himself and his sexuality...I wouldn't worry that he isn't watching straight porn...

In fact I've found porn to cause trouble in relationships no matter what kind it is...

I'd definitely say that him being bi isn't going to make him cheat on you, it just means that he is attracted to people regardless of gender. He's still the exact same man you've always been with...

May I recommend you head over to r/bisexual for more advice if you  want more opinions of people who have good perspective on this. 

Also, its rather intrusive to go through his history...That's private and I'm sure you wouldn't appreciate it either...Being bisexual isn't a reason to distrust someone </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you so much for the advice!! I think you're right, I'm going to keep taking it very very slow! I think its a really big deal that even my boyfriend knows. 

I really appreciate the advice, it seems like the most realistic perspective I've heard so far for me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I actually have a bi friend and talked about her before it was even a thing for me and it didn't go very well..

My mom said it was probably just a phase and that she would figure that out after high school...That right now she is just being selfish so that she has more people to date. That she hates when people say they're bi...Like can't they just pick one or the other...Its greedy and they're just trying to be promiscuous and trendy. Because it is more accepted people think they are when they're really not.

My dad is quietly judgmental. But, I think he would ultimately accept me for who I am...Its honestly mostly my mom.

	<TEXT> I've only told my boyfriend and my two best friends and I'm really really not sure how to tell the rest of the world yet so I thought I'd start with reddit.

I'm 20 and female I've only started openly identifying this year, by this I mean identifying as bi at all...

I'm mostly scared of what people will think, I was raised in a family that had the belief that gay and straight is okay but bi is wrong and greedy and slutty...So, obviously I still worry about what my family, friends, and strangers will say when I tell them. 

Also, still dealing with how I myself feel about it because of this too...

Just wondering how you all coped with coming out and the consequences of it...with friends, boyfriends, girlfriends, family, etc. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I use a shampoo bar from knotty boy "for dreads" even though my hair isn't dreaded, its natural and amazing. And it makes my hair and scalp feel amazing...As well as soft for my hair...Its completely free of sulfates and silicones as well as any other nasties...

I ordered it off their site and it was around $8 plus shipping which was around $9 to Canada...Its lasted me over 3 months though and I've barely made a dent in it.  </TEXT>

But I really appreciate the input, I've been wondering if it would be a good option...I smoke recreationally and even that helps a bit.

	<TEXT> He's also still adjusting to me being bi because I only came out to him two months ago if that...

It probably does take some getting used to, and most days he's okay with it and actually encouraging.  </TEXT>
