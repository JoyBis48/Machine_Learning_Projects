	<TEXT> Everything was cool, liquor, bud, cheeseburgers, then these two bitches started texting the same guy. He showed up at the party, then he was coaching one of the crazy whores on how to beat the other one's ass.

It's a shame, but it's survival of the fitness boys.

	<TEXT> The doctor, after an examination, sighed and said, Ive got some bad news. You have cancer, and youd best put your affairs in order.
The woman was shocked, but managed to compose herself and walk into the waiting room where her daughter had been waiting.
Well, daughter, we women celebrate when things are good, and we celebrate when things dont go so well. In this case, things arent well. I have cancer. So, lets head to the club and have a martini.
After 3 or 4 martinis, the two were feeling a little less somber. There were some laughs and more martinis. They were eventually approached by some of the womans old friends, who were curious as to what the two were celebrating.
The woman told her friends they were drinking to her impending end, Ive been diagnosed with AIDS. The friends were aghast, gave the woman their condolences and beat a hasty retreat.
After the friends left, the womans daughter leaned over and whispered, Momma, I thought you said you were dying of cancer, and you just told your friends you were dying of AIDS! Why did you do that??
Because I dont want any of those bitches sleeping with your father after Im gone. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> One day a redhead, a brunette, and a blonde were on their way to heaven.
God told them the stairs to heaven were 1,000 steps and on every step he was going to tell them a joke. If they laughed they would not be able to get to heaven.
So the redhead made it to the 45th step and laughed.
The brunette made it to the 200th step and laughed.
But the blonde made it to the 999th step and laughed even before god told his joke.
God asked "Why did you laugh I haven't even told the joke yet"
The blonde said "Hahaha I just got the first one!!!" </TEXT>

When Lily didn't step aside and let him kill Harry, that's what caused the rebounding AK curse, causing a piece of his soul to latch on to the only other living thing in the house (who knows where the damn cat was). Harry was the carrier of Tom's soul that he never intended to make. It was purely accidental, but he properly created the other six, giving him an eight piece soul. </TEXT>
