	<TITLE> Scariest moment of my life. </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Last night, me and my friends were all at at one friends house. We were going to smoke when it got darker and his dad went to sleep. His dad finally crashed right around 3:30 maybe 3. When the time came me and four other people had left to walk about a half a mile down the street to go to the woods where this was an old barn. I had smoked there before so I was familiar and had known it was a safe but two of the three had not. At every single sound they would say "What the fuck was that? We need to get the fuck out of here." Me and the other friend would say "Relax its just the sound of the earth." We had really good weed and we had done about two bowls and the three of us were really stoned. Unfortunately, we had a friend who usually was fine to smoke with but this time out of nowhere he started wobbling very subtle. I had noticed but didn't think anything of it, but then he started to turn ghostly white and I started to get a little worried. He then started wobbling like crazy and just in a faint whisper he said "catch me". He fell and hit the back of his head on the solid ground and he just blacked out and were all screaming his name hoping for him to get up because we knew if he had passed out we would have to tell our friends dad and possibly go to the hospital. Fortunately, he had awoken within the next thirty seconds and we had one friend hold his hand and walked home and we had gotten back to his friends house and played super smash bros after our blackout friend had fallen asleep for the night. Although we had gotten away unscathed it truly was one of the scariest moments of my life. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Instead of him carrying around a harp he would carry around a banjo. He would have overalls and a straw hat. For his one instead of harp music it'd be a strum of a banjo. Also his mesmerize would just be like a yodel. Also instead of a chariot it'd be a lawnmower or tractor and when he would land he would say "YEE-HAW!"
