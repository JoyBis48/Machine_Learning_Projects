	<TEXT> It's found in a wide variety of powdered artificial sweeteners, from stevia to splenda. It's a starch and the ratio in stevia, splenda, is 1:1 so a 550 serving [bag of stevia](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/91hm25DmYML._SL1500_.jpg) will have 550g of carbs from maltodextrin. 

I know 1g carb per 1 tablespoon isn't a bad amount of carbs but I was startled when a friend of mine did the research. 

Anyhow, what do you think? </TEXT>

I fucking hate Dr. Who AND 'How I met your mother'

The former is a cheap-ass show where every supporting actor fucking sucks at their job and the special effects are lame.

The latter because it's just not funny. Canned laughs all over the place and Ted is a fucking moronic character  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Nice pic. It's hard for me to picture water not spraying out from the gap between my legs or between the seat and the butt crack

Oh, I need to answer this. You can adjust the position of the nozzle to get the perfect shot at your keester. 

Also, I'd recommend buying a foot stool. If you put your feet on it while pooping, your body will form the natural position for pooping. This gets the poop out easier and is easier on your colon. It's way more comfortable too.  </TEXT>

I'm currently seeking employment in a bigger city. One that has comedy clubs.  

You should do the same, try comedy out at a club. It's not just great for showing you if you're truly interested but it can help refine your talent.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I cannot understand why Logic chose to audio morph these endings. 

I appreciate learning about different anecdotes about him and the creation of the album but I just cannot understand why he made them all choppy and weird. It really kills the flow of the album, IMO. 

Here's some samples of what I'm talking about in case you haven't listened to the album:

['Metropolis' outro](http://youtu.be/4bdMtenCBjc?t=4m42s)  

['Buried Alive' outro](http://youtu.be/tqJ24z5ys4U?t=5m17s)

['Bounce' outro](http://youtu.be/ENDuSctl8h4?t=3m45s)

ETC.

I really love the album, I think the beats and lyrics are awesome. I just don't get it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What the shrek did you just shreking say about me, you little puss-in-boots? I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Shreks, and I've been involved in numerous secret raids on fairytale creatures, and I have over 300 confirmed layers. I am trained in donkeh warfare and I'm the top shreker in the entire Duloc armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will shrek you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before in this swamp, mark my shreking words. You think you can get away with coming into my swamp? Think again, mothershreker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of ogres across Duloc and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, swamp maggot. The storm that shreks out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You're fucking shreked, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can shrek you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my bare ear tube antenna things. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed shrekage, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the Ogre Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to shrek your miserable ass off the face of my swamp, you little long-nosed puppet. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little "clever" comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your shreking tongue. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, you goddamn trespasser. I will shrek fury all over you and you will drown in in the mud of my swamp. You're shreking shreked, kiddo.

Edit 1: Gold? Thanks m'lady.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, and all these 'engineers' bitching about 'LE LIBRAL ARTS R BAD'  

The school I went to had so many graduates move on to medical school and other degree programs. My school was/is notorious for getting graduates out in four years. There were/are plenty of undergraduate research opportunities available. I could go on.  

Sure, they're not meant for everyone but neither is higher education.  

I'd say it was well worth the 10k a year I paid. </TEXT>
