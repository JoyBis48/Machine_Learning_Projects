	<TEXT> like i said, i know plenty of girls who still have a functioning penis, and who regularly use it. One thing's for sure, you will NEVER lack for partners. it's amazing how many propositions i get on OKCupid. Trans girls are at the top of a lot of people's fuck bucket list. hell, when i came out, all my gay AND lesbian friends wanted to sleep with me. it was hilarious. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> it's complicated, i dont mind having a penis, i just dont like using it for sex (dysphoria is a bitch). i never felt they were the right bits to be on a girl, so i always had an aversion to penetrative sex. add to that, i lean more asexual now and you pretty much get a penis that doesnt work anymore.

So i transitioned, pretty much because i didnt really have a choice anymore. i had to become who i knew i was </TEXT>

	<TEXT> i'm kinda late to this thread, but here are my thoughts.

1) if it's not bleeding too bad, monitor it for awhile and if it still doesnt improve, go to the ER/urgent care(or equivalent) and get treatment for it there.

2) make an appointment with a therapist. please. i dont know the reasons behind your attempt, but i know you were prolly in a really dark place. it's one that a lot of us recognize from past experiences. but the spiral doesnt always have to lead downwards, you have to find a way to change that path. please, please, PLEASE make an appointment with a therapist. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> you're human, and a unique one at that. gender exists on a really broad spectrum, and we spend a lot of time figuring out where the hell we land on it. took me dang near 40 years before i acknowledged that i was a girl. i've known since i was 7, but denial is a helluva thing. i was stuck so far deep in the closet that i was munching carpet in Narnia.

dont let society dictate what you can and cannot do. now that's not to say that there wont be consequences, depending on where you live, being creative in your gender presentation might encourage some backlash. but to be true to yourself is the only way to be happy. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Then go on blockers, it'll give you time to figure out if you are trans or not. the only one who can answer that question is you. and blockers just push puberty off for a little while longer. that way you can try life as a girl if you want, to see if it IS what you want. not everyone who goes on blockers transitions. but they're all happy that it gave them time to sort things out.

i say go for it. get yourself an appointment with a therapist, and an endo, and get on blockers as quickly as you can. buy yourself some time to figure it out.

	<TEXT> hmmm, maybe i should change that. i do try and comment in the threads as much as i can. it's kind ahard right now cuz i JUST started a new job, but i should be commenting more as i settle in. 

But as far as this sub goes, we're all trying to moderate it in as fair a manner as we can. and we all discuss everything before we do it. That's why this was stickied, because we all wanted to get input from everyone.

i'm really sad to see anyone go, because this sub exists to help all us transies, both new and old. </TEXT>
