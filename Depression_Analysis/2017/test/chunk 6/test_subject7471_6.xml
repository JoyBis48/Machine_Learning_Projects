	<TEXT> But we can say things like:

Here are reasons A, B, and C to go vegan. You will be in good company too! Former Vice President Al Gore and Senator Cory Booker are vegan. Google searches for the term vegan have risen sharply in the past few years. Even athletes like 9-time Olympic gold medalist Carl Lewis has adopted a vegan diet. The mainstream is rapidly acknowledging the importance of choosing a compassionate, vegan lifestyle. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not suggesting we say, "go vegan because it is normal." That clearly won't work.

I'm suggesting we still use logical arguments to advocate veganism, but also make it more palatable to people by reassuring them that they are making a decision that is normal. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The eggs that you eat are not fertilized so there is no need to worry about any baby chickens inside the eggs.

However, there are baby chickens dying in another sense. Male chickens do not lay eggs, and the males of the egg laying variety do not grow fast enough to be worth raising for meat either. These chickens are commonly ground up alive [as can be seen in this short video clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huVJDWaKrxM) or explained in more detail [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN0g13kMk6s). Some other places may simply throw the birds into large trash bags to suffocate.

The hens themselves frequently live in terrible conditions even in facilities that try to advertise themselves as being more humane. [Here are pictures of free-range, cage-free, and organic egg laying operations](http://imgur.com/a/fp7C0). Even on the nicest farms though, the hens' egg production begins to drop off after a couple years of age and they will be sent to slaughter. There is no economic way to let these animals live out their entire lives. [Here is a picture showing how old various animals usually are when slaughtered](http://i.imgur.com/LLyM10R.jpg).

The story for dairy is much the same as with eggs. Cows only give significant amounts of milk for a period of time after birth, so they are repeatedly impregnated to keep up the milk production. The males do not produce milk, so they are separated from their mothers shortly after birth. Cows suffer greatly when separated from their young. [Here you can see a video of a mother cow crying for her calf](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBnZPJJ2QG4). The male calves will be slaughtered and sold as veal.

Once again the milk production of dairy cows also drops off after a few years. As shown in the image above, they will also be sent to slaughter at a fraction of their natural life span. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> **Objective:** We examined the effect of protein from meat as **complementary foods** on growth and metabolic profiles of breastfed infants.

**Design:** This was a secondary analysis from a trial in which exclusively breastfed infants (56 mo old from the Denver, CO, metro area) were randomly assigned to receive commercially available pureed meats (Meat group; n = 14) or infant cereal (Cereal group; n = 28) as their primary complementary feedings for 5 mo. 

It says there that the pureed meats and infant cereal were complementary to the breast feeding the infants were receiving. Did you read that and think that the mothers were eating pureed meats and infant cereal?

Also, something else you may have missed when you (didn't carefully) read these studies:

**Background:** High intake of cow-milk protein in formula-fed infants is associated with higher weight gain and increased adiposity, which have led to recommendations to limit protein intake in later infancy.

The study is stating that the excess weight and fat that infants gain from consuming dairy formula is a bad thing after the first few months (which is what this study was looking at). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There is not growing evidence. You cited a handful of individual studies that were not looking at vegetarian or vegan diets as a whole.

For example your first study has a sample size of 14 infants fed meat and 28 infants fed cereal. It concluded that their meat diet had more protein than the cereal diet therefore the protein contributed to more growth. If they had fed a higher protein non-meat food, then they would expect the non-meat food to contribute to more growth. 

Compare that to the American Dietetic Association's position paper that cites over 200 studies to support their position. My sources are reputable experts in the dietary field that have conducted reviews of all the literature. It is not some study that you or I are trying to take out of context to support our position. Can you find a similarly reputable organization that has reviewed all of the literature and come to a conclusion that supports your position? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A substantial number of animals in slaughterhouses are not stunned properly by the captive bolt guns that are commonly used, and continue down the kill lines fully conscious. 

Many meat eaters also eat Halal or Kosher meats as well as chickens that are killed without any stunning, but simply have their necks slit and are allowed to painfully bleed out while fully conscious. 

Another fairly common technique is controlled atmospheric killing. [Here you can see footage of that process from Australia's largest pig slaughterhouse](https://youtu.be/KArL5YjaL5U?t=1h23m13s).

Speaking hypothetically, if someone kills one animal to send a message, and in turn convinces others to change their behavior enough to save 10 animals from suffering in ways like that shown in the footage above, would you consider their action justified? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There is overwhelming consensus that meat is not necessary for a healthy diet.

**[American Dietetic Association](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19562864)**

 It is the position of the American Dietetic Association that appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases. Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence, and for athletes.

**[Dietitians of Canada](http://www.dietitians.ca/Nutrition-Resources-A-Z/Factsheets/Vegetarian/Eating-Guidelines-for-Vegans.aspx)**

 A well planned vegan diet can meet all of these needs. It is safe and healthy for pregnant and breastfeeding women, babies, children, teens and seniors.

**[The British National Health Service](http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/Vegetarianhealth/Pages/Vegandiets.aspx)**

 With good planning and an understanding of what makes up a healthy, balanced vegan diet, you can get all the nutrients your body needs.

**[The British Nutrition Foundation](http://www.nutrition.org.uk/publications/briefingpapers/vegetarian-nutrition)**

 A well-planned, balanced vegetarian or vegan diet can be nutritionally adequate ... Studies of UK vegetarian and vegan children have revealed that their growth and development are within the normal range.

**[The Dietitians Association of Australia](http://daa.asn.au/for-the-public/smart-eating-for-you/nutrition-a-z/vegan-diets/)**

 Vegan diets are a type of vegetarian diet, where only plant-based foods are eaten. They differ to other vegetarian diets in that no animal products are usually consumed or used. Despite these restrictions, with good planning it is still possible to obtain all the nutrients required for good health on a vegan diet.

**[The United States Department of Agriculture](http://www.choosemyplate.gov/healthy-eating-tips/tips-for-vegetarian.html)**

 Vegetarian diets (*see context*) can meet all the recommendations for nutrients. The key is to consume a variety of foods and the right amount of foods to meet your calorie needs. Follow the food group recommendations for your age, sex, and activity level to get the right amount of food and the variety of foods needed for nutrient adequacy. Nutrients that vegetarians may need to focus on include protein, iron, calcium, zinc, and vitamin B12.

**[The National Health and Medical Research Council](http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/_files_nhmrc/publications/attachments/n55a_australian_dietary_guidelines_summary_130530.pdf)**

 Alternatives to animal foods include nuts, seeds, legumes, beans and tofu. For all Australians,
these foods increase dietary variety and can provide a valuable, affordable source of protein
and other nutrients found in meats. These foods are also particularly important for those who
follow vegetarian or vegan dietary patterns. Australians following a vegetarian diet can still meet nutrient requirements if energy needs are met and the appropriate number and variety of serves from the Five Food Groups are eaten throughout the day. For those eating a vegan diet, supplementation of B12 is recommended.

**[The Mayo Clinic](http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-living/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/vegetarian-diet/art-20046446)**

  A well-planned vegetarian diet (*see context*) can meet the needs of people of all ages, including children, teenagers, and pregnant or breast-feeding women. The key is to be aware of your nutritional needs so that you plan a diet that meets them.

**[The Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada](http://www.heartandstroke.com/site/c.ikIQLcMWJtE/b.3484249/k.2F6C/Healthy_living__Vegetarian_diets.htm)**

 Vegetarian diets (*see context*) can provide all the nutrients you need at any age, as well as some additional health benefits. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> **[American Dietetic Association](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19562864)**

 It is the position of the American Dietetic Association that appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases. Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence, and for athletes.

**[Dietitians of Canada](http://www.dietitians.ca/Nutrition-Resources-A-Z/Factsheets/Vegetarian/Eating-Guidelines-for-Vegans.aspx)**

 A well planned vegan diet can meet all of these needs. It is safe and healthy for pregnant and breastfeeding women, babies, children, teens and seniors.

**[The British National Health Service](http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/Vegetarianhealth/Pages/Vegandiets.aspx)**

 With good planning and an understanding of what makes up a healthy, balanced vegan diet, you can get all the nutrients your body needs.

**[The British Nutrition Foundation](http://www.nutrition.org.uk/publications/briefingpapers/vegetarian-nutrition)**

 A well-planned, balanced vegetarian or vegan diet can be nutritionally adequate ... Studies of UK vegetarian and vegan children have revealed that their growth and development are within the normal range.

**[The Dietitians Association of Australia](http://daa.asn.au/for-the-public/smart-eating-for-you/nutrition-a-z/vegan-diets/)**

 Vegan diets are a type of vegetarian diet, where only plant-based foods are eaten. They differ to other vegetarian diets in that no animal products are usually consumed or used. Despite these restrictions, with good planning it is still possible to obtain all the nutrients required for good health on a vegan diet.

**[The United States Department of Agriculture](http://www.choosemyplate.gov/healthy-eating-tips/tips-for-vegetarian.html)**

 Vegetarian diets (*see context*) can meet all the recommendations for nutrients. The key is to consume a variety of foods and the right amount of foods to meet your calorie needs. Follow the food group recommendations for your age, sex, and activity level to get the right amount of food and the variety of foods needed for nutrient adequacy. Nutrients that vegetarians may need to focus on include protein, iron, calcium, zinc, and vitamin B12.

**[The National Health and Medical Research Council](http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/_files_nhmrc/publications/attachments/n55a_australian_dietary_guidelines_summary_130530.pdf)**

 Alternatives to animal foods include nuts, seeds, legumes, beans and tofu. For all Australians,
these foods increase dietary variety and can provide a valuable, affordable source of protein
and other nutrients found in meats. These foods are also particularly important for those who
follow vegetarian or vegan dietary patterns. Australians following a vegetarian diet can still meet nutrient requirements if energy needs are met and the appropriate number and variety of serves from the Five Food Groups are eaten throughout the day. For those eating a vegan diet, supplementation of B12 is recommended.

**[The Mayo Clinic](http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-living/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/vegetarian-diet/art-20046446)**

  A well-planned vegetarian diet (*see context*) can meet the needs of people of all ages, including children, teenagers, and pregnant or breast-feeding women. The key is to be aware of your nutritional needs so that you plan a diet that meets them.

**[The Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada](http://www.heartandstroke.com/site/c.ikIQLcMWJtE/b.3484249/k.2F6C/Healthy_living__Vegetarian_diets.htm)**

 Vegetarian diets (*see context*) can provide all the nutrients you need at any age, as well as some additional health benefits. </TEXT>

Every single time they come back with video showing horrifying conditions and terrible mistreatment. Even the industry acknowledges that mutilations like dehorning, debeaking, tail docking, and castration all without anesthesia are common. We know that many animals are kept in battery cages and gestation crates and those that aren't are rarely afforded much more space. Nobody should be able to buy these products anymore without acknowledging that they are paying to support animal cruelty. </TEXT>

Whenever you see these stories, please consider making a donation to a group doing actual work to help animals. [Here are charities that Animal Charity Evaluators has recommended as the most effective for helping animals](http://www.animalcharityevaluators.org/recommendations/).

	<TEXT> I try to avoid leather products. Leather production is very harmful to the environment (which goes against why many people get a Tesla in the first place) and animals suffer immensely in the production process too. There are so many excellent and affordable alternatives to leather that are easily available. Why shouldn't they make it an option (or even the standard)? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There is more to determining how we ought to behave than simply stating what you like. We need to consider the impact our actions have on all impacted parties. In the case of consuming animal products there is a great deal of harm caused to the animals who live short lives in captivity and are slaughtered for food.

Protein is not exclusive to animal products. There is overwhelming consensus that appropriately planned vegetarian and vegan diets are healthy for all stages of life. Vegan foods like beans, rice, and peanut butter are some of the cheapest sources of protein available.

**[American Dietetic Association](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19562864)**

 It is the position of the American Dietetic Association that appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases. Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence, and for athletes.

**[Dietitians of Canada](http://www.dietitians.ca/Nutrition-Resources-A-Z/Factsheets/Vegetarian/Eating-Guidelines-for-Vegans.aspx)**

 A well planned vegan diet can meet all of these needs. It is safe and healthy for pregnant and breastfeeding women, babies, children, teens and seniors.

**[The British National Health Service](http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/Vegetarianhealth/Pages/Vegandiets.aspx)**

 With good planning and an understanding of what makes up a healthy, balanced vegan diet, you can get all the nutrients your body needs.

**[The British Nutrition Foundation](http://www.nutrition.org.uk/publications/briefingpapers/vegetarian-nutrition)**

 A well-planned, balanced vegetarian or vegan diet can be nutritionally adequate ... Studies of UK vegetarian and vegan children have revealed that their growth and development are within the normal range.

**[The Dietitians Association of Australia](http://daa.asn.au/for-the-public/smart-eating-for-you/nutrition-a-z/vegan-diets/)**

 Vegan diets are a type of vegetarian diet, where only plant-based foods are eaten. They differ to other vegetarian diets in that no animal products are usually consumed or used. Despite these restrictions, with good planning it is still possible to obtain all the nutrients required for good health on a vegan diet.

**[The United States Department of Agriculture](http://www.choosemyplate.gov/healthy-eating-tips/tips-for-vegetarian.html)**

 Vegetarian diets (*see context*) can meet all the recommendations for nutrients. The key is to consume a variety of foods and the right amount of foods to meet your calorie needs. Follow the food group recommendations for your age, sex, and activity level to get the right amount of food and the variety of foods needed for nutrient adequacy. Nutrients that vegetarians may need to focus on include protein, iron, calcium, zinc, and vitamin B12.

**[The National Health and Medical Research Council](http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/_files_nhmrc/publications/attachments/n55a_australian_dietary_guidelines_summary_130530.pdf)**

 Alternatives to animal foods include nuts, seeds, legumes, beans and tofu. For all Australians,
these foods increase dietary variety and can provide a valuable, affordable source of protein
and other nutrients found in meats. These foods are also particularly important for those who
follow vegetarian or vegan dietary patterns. Australians following a vegetarian diet can still meet nutrient requirements if energy needs are met and the appropriate number and variety of serves from the Five Food Groups are eaten throughout the day. For those eating a vegan diet, supplementation of B12 is recommended.

**[The Mayo Clinic](http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-living/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/vegetarian-diet/art-20046446)**

  A well-planned vegetarian diet (*see context*) can meet the needs of people of all ages, including children, teenagers, and pregnant or breast-feeding women. The key is to be aware of your nutritional needs so that you plan a diet that meets them.

**[The Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada](http://www.heartandstroke.com/site/c.ikIQLcMWJtE/b.3484249/k.2F6C/Healthy_living__Vegetarian_diets.htm)**

 Vegetarian diets (*see context*) can provide all the nutrients you need at any age, as well as some additional health benefits. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Virtually all hens in commercial egg operationswhether cage or cage-freecome from hatcheries that kill all male chicks shortly after hatching. The males are of no use to the egg industry because they don't lay eggs and aren't bred to grow as large or as rapidly as chickens used in the meat industry. Common methods of killing male chicks include suffocation, gassing and grinding. Hundreds of millions of male chicks are killed at hatcheries each year in the United States. </TEXT>
