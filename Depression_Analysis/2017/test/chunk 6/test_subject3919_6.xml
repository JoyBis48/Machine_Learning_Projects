I'm cool with not maxing out games, but if there is a better graphics card of the same price I'd love some recommendations.
 I'm also looking to do some editing with special effects (it won't be a very huge thing so  I'm not looking to tilt my purchasing towards that, though I'd like to know if this would be able to handle minor editing stuff)

I do plan to throw in a SSD and a blueray writer/reader later but for now my budget isn't too huge.

I also have a friend selling me a CPU cooler. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> These games look amazing and I'm tired of BS shooters like COD. So bought  Amra 2 a long time ago and never played it. 

 About 5 mins ago I traded a valuable Team Fortress 2 item for Arma 3. I don't know what to do **at all**. I wanted to ask for the advice you would have given you self when starting. (would love advice about getting into the community)


If I'm in the wrong place for posting this, please inform me. I'll delete this and move there. :) Thanks!

Edit: I tried messing around in Arma 2 with the campaign and DayZ and It was like walking through your friends house in the dark. I was to repeat my self lost. It was fun though. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If anyone played the old x-men GameCube game, you may remember the part where someone hurts you so much and there is a cut scene where they speak about how you need to burn a healer mutant to kill them. Also in the newest movie he has a machine put on his heart to prevent healing.

So if he is faced against someone like the human torch or maybe a army of fire benders, he could face some real challenges.

As far as the machine thing goes in a fight that would be unrealistic. I don't think you could really pin down the metal-skeleton-mutant and put that on his heart. He also took it out on his own in the movie.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My dad had something happen like this in college. Some girls went in his dorm and unscrewed the things that held his mattress up so he would fall when he lay down on it. When he got back after working out with a friend, he thew his bag on the bed and it collapsed. The found not one *but* 2 screw drivers left under the bed they put 2 and 2 together and decided he should wear a sling to classes the next day. The girls who pulled the prank asked what happened and he said "my bed gave out and my elbow got pinned in a weird place fracturing the bone." The girls started crying and admitting to the prank apologizing profusely. He then reached out with the "broken" are in a way you could tell it was 100% fine and said "It's okay. On the bright side I found 2 screwdrivers under my bed!"  </TEXT>
