	<TEXT> The people who are calling this season a "Sinking Ship" and that we "screwed up all season by not playing Manzeil" should read this. This has been the most exciting season of football since 95, for me. We have made some great steps forward, and we get to finish off the season letting Johnny get ready for next year. I dont hate it. No more controversy. Go Browns. *edit: I spell like a Steelers fan* </TEXT>

If the only time he hit the field was a clutch situation, then the odds are in his favor of being really good, plus, (and I am officially excited to see him play) Johnny's GONNA get hurt with his style. It's not 'if', but 'when'. He was lucky to not have gotten hurt on that TD scramble. He took a crazy hit to the side during the play. Plus we know that Hoyer is better than any backup or starter since we got back in '99, so he's a safe bet. If he can't get a starting job somewhere, I hope we sign him as a backup. </TEXT>

I dont want people to make a job out of filling our sub with woman-flesh. I can-not, however, as a warm blooded North-East Ohio sports fan, turn down a girl when she has Cleveland Browns Pasties on and tells me she is proud of us beating the Falcons, and would I like to reward the sub with her ample chest? I'm probably going to take that picture and post it every time. Not because it's pornographic, but because we all earned it, and deserve to bask in the gifts given to us by our supporters. You will PROBABLY not see any more pics from me on the subject, but I also cant promise that another girl from my church isnt going to be like "Hey! you beat the Colts! Lemme take a boob picture in a cowboy hat for your sub!" I wouldnt have the heart to not take and share the unique bounty that being a winning Browns Fan on this sub generates. I'm sorry if you are offended. And I'm not annoyed by your opinions. I'm simply down hearted by the energy that has swept over this sub, recently. People attacking other subs, attacking our own members, and a general air of "We are a serious ball club sans shenanigans" has me a little down, but your opinions are sacred, because they are your opinions.

I agree with people not asking for boob pics, but if a female Browns fan can't take a picture of her ample bosom in celebration of a win, then I dont know how we can call this THE Browns subreddit. If people were hounding folks for pictures, I could understand, but freely given Brownie Boobies being down voted when it's part of our history, dare I say, part of the very lifeblood of our membership; like beer and bad memes and down voting to punish people that are different.

	<TEXT> I was really happy to see this happen when it did. 5 ints and no tds over two games is the right time to put someone on the bench and make them  watch their replacement. He did better than I thought in certain cases, and worse than I thought he would be in others. Good stuff from him though, and I'm glad he got his start. I do not, however, think they will keep him in next week. Just a hunch. We'll see. </TEXT>

Which is the same as

 you're too much of a homer to see it.

We dont need to call names. I'm one of the most chill fans out there. I'm just commenting that I saw a lot of busted calls. I DONT usually see or say such things. You generalized me on a single opinion. Again: We're all on the same side, here. </TEXT>
