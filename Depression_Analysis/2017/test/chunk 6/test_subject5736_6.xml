	<TEXT> If i am using this picture (http://rossmannellcomments.edublogs.org/files/2013/12/Planetary-Axial-Tilts-1qtzpi8.jpg[1] ) as a reference for the axial tilts of the solar system, will these numbers always be correct? Could they also be negative instead of positive depending on from where you view the planets? </TEXT>
