	<TEXT> Watch some of the behind the scenes videos of the prequels. True effort is put into making them good movies. All of the cast and crew (minus Rick McCallum and George Lucas) are really trying their hardest to bring back the magic of Star Wars. Seriously, most of the CGI holds up well today, some genuinely good performances are given by McGregor and McDarmid, and there really are a lot of good scenes to be found. That's enough redemption for me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No, I'd say in September, when they release all the toys and books and everything. I would also imagine that they'd release a comic con trailer to the public. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Nothing changed - If the majority of professional movie critics don't like a movie, it's probably safe to make the assumption that most people think that movie is not good. Just because you have a different opinion, it doesn't mean that everyone else's is wrong or invalid. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not trying to tell you that you should like it, everyone's entitled to their opinions, but that's sorta the point -

It's basically a piece of cinematic "art." I know it sounds pretentious or whatever, but you're supposed to interpret it how *you* want to interpret it. There's not gonna be an explanation, because it's up to you to explain it to yourself, if that makes sense. </TEXT>
