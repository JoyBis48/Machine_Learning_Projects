	<TEXT> I'm a guy, but I love the idea that even in such a story focused game with a Male lead, there are options to play as Female members of mother base for the open world missions. That's really cool, to me. I wonder how far it extends? Story missions are probably exempt? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They are two very different characters opposites in intent and design too. But Kiefer is a good actor, because if anything Jack Bauer character in a game with the tone of "Platoon" is kind of incongruous. 

But Kiefer already impressed me in trailers and GZ :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Snake and Bauer are completely different characters on opposite spectrums in many senses. That said Kiefer is a good actor and I doubt it will be the 24 jingoistic action man thing for Metal Gear. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In Peace Walker, the tapes were specific to missions and stuff, so it will probably still be contextual. Videogamer's recent preview said they don't understand how Kojima Productions could have made as many tapes as they have. So I assume there are a lot! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> To defend them they aren't the biggest studio and they have a lot less shackles on their systems than most games almost guaranteeing some bugs :)

They also have an insane ability to establish a sense of place.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I want an easy mode in dark souls - i've used guides but alt tabbing out of the world is immersion breaking. I love the atmosphere and design but I personally don't want a challenge in that way. I respect people that do though.

I also understand forcing no easy mode is Good to introduce people to new things. But I want a mod or something, personally :) i like the idea of less challenge.

Scared to write this post but there you have it :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sort of, if i could distill it i would say there would be:

1 skill/trait 1-100 for dialogue efficacy
1 skil/traitl 1-100 for combat efficacy
1 skill/trait 1-100 for magic efficacy
1 skill/trait 1-100 for stealth efficacy
1 skill/trait 1-100 for athleticism

None of those stats overlap into other mechanics, but if the game is designed with all those mechanics in mind it makes picking skills more of a "what i want to do" scenario instead of "how do i make my stats balance so my character good at this?"

Skyrim sort of does this, i think. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes and no.

Yes single skills for gameplay but have so many gameplay elements that upgrading those skills in different combinations and ratios makes it fun.

E.g.

I want to have a stealth assasin so I will put points into combat, stealth, and athletics

I want a stealth ghost so I swap combat for magic, so i can cast invisibility.

I want a wise talking theif? I choose stealth, dialogue and athletics.

Imagine the points directly correlating to how much X Y Z gameplay elements you wabt to engage with.

Instead of having dialogue split up amongst skills reverse it so the skills are split into specific mechanics. </TEXT>
