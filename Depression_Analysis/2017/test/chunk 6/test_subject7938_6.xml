	<TEXT> I bought a home hood about 8 months before returning to grad school. Since then I've been using the super academic hood. Essentially zero contams with the vigorous edible fungi, even when filling culture syringes. It sucks, but this is a rare case where more money actually equals better performance.

Pro tip: Quit your job and go back to school. Contam free. But bills. Lots of bills. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> But hey! As a first world citizen that ate three meals today, I declare the rest of the world should not grow GMOs. Even if that means not enough food to go around...


A few companies in control of any commodity is something to keep an eye on, but this is a bigger issue. It is a moral failing to not allow reasonable deployment of GMOs. The world has a lot of people. Too many went to bed hungry tonight. These shitheads stand in the way of a partial solution. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Eh, personal experience. Skaters, more than even pedestrians, seem to have no awareness of their surroundings. Just about three hours ago I almost hit a dude on a board since he was going the wrong way down state and not looking.

On a bike, Peds have right-of-way in all cases except at a controlled intersection. Skaters don't have the same right-of-way.

I'd be pissed if there was a soccer game in the street everyday too. It would impinge on others' fair use of the street. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>   There is lots of nice concrete, no cars, and even a skate store right there.

So skate culture is oblivious to the mixed-use nature of State? All the Pedestrians, bicyclists, cabs, and buses don't use that street at all. But hey! It's not like it's illegal... </TEXT>
