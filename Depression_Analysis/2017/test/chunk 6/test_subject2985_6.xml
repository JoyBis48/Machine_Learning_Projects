	<TEXT> It's the number of people who have donated to his campaign so far. He's gotten 400,000 donations from 250,000 different people, with an average of about $33 per donation (totally to $15 million).

To put that into perspective, Hillary has gotten donations from about 50,000 people so far (for this cycle), and at the same time in the 2008 cycle, Obama (who as we all know defeated Hillary) had donations from about 180,000 people.

TL;DR - Bernie has about 5 times more support from the 99% than Hillary, and he's even significantly outperforming Obama's 2008 campaign (with every day people). Hillary has the billionaires locked up, but Bernie's campaign runs on more than money. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think most states require you to be registered with a party to vote in that party's primary. So as a registered republican, you could vote for Bernie in the general election if he gets the democratic nomination, but unless your state has open primaries, you couldn't vote for him in the democratic primary. You'd need to register as a democrat, first.

UPDATE: I just called my county board of elections, and for my state at least, it sounds like you declare your party affiliation by voting in that party's primary (which is what I think you were suggesting). So you just show up and ask for a party's ticket, and then you become registered with that party by voting in their primary. I'd still verify for your county/state. Sorry for any confusion. </TEXT>

If you don't mind me asking, are you planning on registering as a democrat to vote for him in the primary? </TEXT>
