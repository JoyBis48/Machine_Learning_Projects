	<TEXT> It won't become a trend because of the cultural barriers. But might see a few more cases in the future. Women will go wherever they see a safe and prosperous future, but their first preference will probably be a fellow native. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't know what all the fuss is about. Modi's mother tongue is Gujarati and he has no issues with Hindi being promoted. People need to stop criticising just for the sake of criticism. I'm Punjabi and I think Hindi should be the language India should promote abroad. I mean, we can't promote all of our languages, gotta stick with one.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 1. Astronomy - I recently joined the amature astronomers club in my city and it's been an amazing experience to say the least. I am still a newbie so I hardly know much but I think my passion is only going to grow.

1. Reading - before my last break-up I used to read a lot, but my ex-gf used to devour most of my time and then by the last few months of the relationship she turned into one  of those "crying" manipulative women. Rediscovering my love for reading has been one of the best thing I have ever done. I recently finished Brave New World and right now I'm reading Crime and Punishment by Dostoyevsky.

3. Cricket - I love Cricket. The Ashes will begin soon and I can't wait. 

4. Gaming - I like playing Civilization 5 whenever I find time. It's the best game I ever played.

5. Learning to play the Harmonica. I bought a diatonic harmonica a month ago and I spend around 30 minutes everyday practicing it. It'll take a lot of time before I learn to play my favourite songs, but the investment will be worth it. </TEXT>
