	<TEXT> As a somewhat native speaker (I grew up bilingual, with English being the slightly more preferred language), I must say that  is a word that I've never really had to use, as compared to 
My take would be that  seems more like an adjective to describe a thing or person as being spontaneous but  is used more like an adverb to modify a verb? That's why I would say  fits better into your sample sentence. </TEXT>
