	<TEXT> I saw this in liquor stores in the 1980s. The chilling machines at my neighbourhood liquor store were tinted blue on the inside, so it looked like you were putting beer in blue water. I thought that was a nice touch. I haven't seen them since. Thanks for taking me down Memory Lane, OP. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Waffles. The little square hole things act as reservoirs for maple syrup. If you pour the syrup just right, you can end up with more syrup than waffle, and to me that is exactly what waffles are for; they are nothing but vessels for sweet, sweet mapley syrup. </TEXT>
