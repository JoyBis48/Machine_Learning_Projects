	<TEXT> Despite any of that, the popularity of the NFL is rising at a ridiculous rate, especially internationally, despite it's horrible management. Hockey, rugby and lacrosse are also gaining popularity despite being just as, if not more, dangerous than football (maybe not lacrosse). Wether it's liked or not, the NFL is in it for the long haul. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> TV, or at least we were a few years ago we were, and are still coming down from our prime. Game of Thrones, Breaking Bad, The Office, Entourage, Lost, How I Met Your Mother, Mad Men, True Detective, Dexter, House of Cards, American Horror Story, the list goes on and on.

	<TEXT> I get sad when people hate on people who drive nice cars (I don't think I have much of a bias, I drive a nine year old Nissan and I'm very content with it). Although there are those people out there, for the most part people don't buy cars based on what others think but rather based on wether or not they personally like them. One of my best friends owns a new Corvette, it's a beautiful car. He's not rich, he lives in an apartment smaller than mine and saved up for 4 years to get it. He's not a dick on the road, he's probably the best driver I know and would never drive the lest bit recklessly leste he put his precious Chevrolet in danger. And he didn't buy it because he's materialistic, he doesn't care what others think of it, he just loves cars and is willing to invest in a hobby he cares about. Yet people still assume they know enough to judge him based on his means of transportation. I mean wouldn't it be wrong for someone judged you based on your hobby or interests? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In a totally serious way, Paul Blart... It gets so much shit but I really did like that movie. No one wants to see the second with me and it's been killing me. I might just break down and see it alone.

Also any movie that is the 4th in a series. On Stranger Tides, Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, you name it. Sure they aren't nearly as good as the first few, but the nostalgia, the characters, the awesomeness, it's usually enough to make a pretty damn good movie, even if it doesn't compare to the others. Any movie with Jack Sparrow or Indiana Jones is awesome in my book, no matter how shitty the story line. </TEXT>

Naturally, the only way to get to the bottom of it was to put a watermelon in a diaper and carry it around all day as if it was a real baby. I think you see where Im going with this. Anyhow, it was a drizzly Tuesday, I was taking Mel to the library to get some studying done. I go down there all the time and pretty much never see anyone I know, so I wasn't worried about being judged. What I didn't account for however is that this was the week of finals. As soon as I looked out the window I already saw four or five people I knew. EVERYONE was there. I made the snap decision to abandon Mel in the cab (I know, I'm a monster). We said our good byes, and that was it. The best part though, was as soon as I exited the cab someone else immediately got in it and it drove away. I can only assume it was an incredible, confusing ride. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> [Hey Ya!] (http://youtu.be/PWgvGjAhvIw) is actually surprisingly depressing considering how upbeat it is. [Under the Bridge] (http://youtu.be/lwlogyj7nFE) is also very sad. Read the lyrics on the video, its all about being along and using heroine to fill the void. As far as just plain sad though, there is nothing compared to [Henry Russel's Last Words] (http://youtu.be/i_shhl06szA). So fucking sad. </TEXT>

EDIT: Oh.

EDIT 2: Oh? I thought it was supposed to be funny because Verne Troyer is little, so the little desk makes sense for him. I had no idea there was a real desk, let alone a stolen desk. I feel like every time I'm done thinking about this I have a sudden realization that opens a whole new can of worms. I have checked in to stoner purgatory.  </TEXT>
