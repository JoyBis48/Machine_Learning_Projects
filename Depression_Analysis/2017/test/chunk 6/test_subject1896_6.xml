	<TEXT> Hey, you should give her (him?) a guest compliment at City Hall (or at Chamber of Commerce at DCA). It would really make their day, I'm sure.

	<TEXT> Wow. I'm extremely humbled by this. That's my tweet. I started posting my tweets in Nov to get feedback on my jokes and reddit has been very kind to me. Seeing someone else post my own tweets is so crazy. 
To clarify, I work at Disneyland and teenagers run rampant through the park and say YOLO. All. The. Time.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My mind awoke before my body did. I lay motionless, lacking memory, afraid to peel back my own eyelids to face my reality. One eye opens: pitch black darkness. The other eye follows and soon and I realize that... *could I still be... in the coffin*? I rack my brain for memories... why is it so hard to remember? The wood above my head is cracking from the weight above-- I'm underground. Rapidly, more dirt fills the empty space around me. I try to fight back. *Is this how I die? In the pitch, dark, blackness....?* </TEXT>
