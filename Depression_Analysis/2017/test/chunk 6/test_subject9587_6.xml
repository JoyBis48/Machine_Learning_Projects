	<TEXT> Minor pet peeve of mine:  "enemy" is a term of war, or battle, whereas "friend" refers to a social relationship.  This phrase is more powerful (and conveys the sentiment better) if altered slightly:

"The enemy of my enemy is my *ally*."

Not being a dick, just putting the idea out there; do what you like!

Fuck the Raiders. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In the post-game presser Fox said that Rahim was just very fired up, yelling, "That's why you drafted me!"  Fox said that it was all very positive, just lots of emotion after a big play.

	<TEXT> Totally right.  Football in the new era is getting to the dance,  then playing your best 3-4 games there.  If we play like the SF, SD, or IND games in the playoffs, we have a good chance.   If we play the SEA or NYJ games, not so much.  It is true for every other team in the league, too.  But I think that the Broncos have a greater margin for error than almost every other team, and that feels good (for example, both the D and O can carry us if one falters).

GG.  Fuck the Raiders.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Totally agree.  My go-to "elevator" explanation is this:

1.  Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer digital currency which is traded through a *network*.  (People understand "peer-to-peer" from Napster, and most have a reasonable concept of a "network").

2.  Just like banks/companies/families have a ledger/transaction balance/checkbook - so does the Bitcoin network.  But, it is public, and everyone in the network has a copy.  (Likewise, people understand a "ledger" - making the jump from a pen-and-paper ledger to a digital, decentralized on is certainly a leap, but you can help facilitate that leap by introducing that concept early)

3.  Mention the "headline" benefits (no 3rd party, personal security, etc.)  (Get 'em excited!)

**Then**, if they are interested, we can talk about the blockchain, mining, SHA256, etc, etc.  But don't load people up with that up front - they'll get scared. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Through the first seven weeks, I think we are getting a much better picture of how this season is going to play out.  And let me tell you a secret: it is going to be **AWESOME**.

We are looking at absolute dogfights in the AFC West, AFC North, NFC East, NFC North, and NFC West, with at least four legitimately strong Wild Card teams in each conference.  Do not be surprised if a 10-6 team whiffs again this year (like last year's Cards).

And then, the playoffs will get going.  Since opening up the year slowly, the Colts, Broncos, Ravens, Patriots, and Chargers look *really* strong.  Add in a dark horse like the Bengals (who have fallen off of late) and the Chiefs or Texans and you've got some great playoff football brewing.

And the NFC won't disappoint either!  Cowboys and Eagles still have 2 games against each other, but are otherwise X-1.  Packers and Lions are X-2, and have looked unstoppable at times.  The West is going to be absurd unless Seattle falls off the map, as the top 3 teams still have 5 games between them (Arizona has the lone win, so far).  The possible playoff matchups here are also very intriguing.

tl;dr - As we approach the midway point, this year's playoff push looks to be thoroughly entertaining - and the playoffs themselves will be even better. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Check out [fivethirtyeight](http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/nfl-week-6-elo-ratings-and-playoff-odds/), they do a weekly "Playoff Odds" calculation and often mention the possibility of a team going winless.  I have linked to week 6, where the Raiders were predicted to go winless in 11% of the simulations - the Jaguars, the other winless team at the time, went winless in 7% of the simulations.  

So, to answer your question, I would guess that the number is slightly higher than 11% - so probably better than 1-in-9. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hahaha.  Harbaugh is awful.  Even if he wins this challenge (50/50), he just moves the Broncos back 15-20 yards.   Still 1st down and 10 to go.  Is your time out worth that little?  What will Kaepernick do the next time he can't snap the ball in time? </TEXT>
