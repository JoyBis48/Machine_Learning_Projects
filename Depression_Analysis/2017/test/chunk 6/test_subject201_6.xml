	<TEXT> Thanks for your advice. Your definitely right about there being to many variables to be able to predict landing area. I was hoping there was some equation where you input thrust, height, and wind speed and come up with a 10X10 foot estimate. But like you said, it wouldn't be something you could do on the fly. </TEXT>
