	<TEXT> I don't have an on-line source for this, but in The Empire of Liberty (Oxford History of America) page 577 reads "Although some of the founders ... were fairly devout Christians, most leading Founders were not deeply or passionately religious and few had much of a spiritual life ... Most of them, at best only passively believed in organized Christianity and, at worst, privately scorned and mocked it."  The leaders of the Revolution were more often men of the Enlightenment than men of the Bible.  
And on page 578 ... "it has been estimated that scarcely one in twenty Americans was a member of a formal member of a church."
The importance of religion ebbs and flows in American history.  As you point out it was very important a number of the colonies I should have said revolutionary , not colonial America), and would rise again during the second Great Awakening, but at the time of the revolution and the nation's founding, American was a largely secular place. (And I've oversimplified the situation in my summary here.  Get a hold of the Empire of Liberty if you want to learn more.  You'll be better informed about the early years of America than almost all your fellow citizens.)

	<TEXT> The Puritans certainly looked to the Old Testament for inspiration, so I guess you'd have a point.  However, colonial America wasn't a particularly religious society, many of our Founding Fathers were skeptical of religion (or indifferent church members)  and current form evangelical Christianity barely existed until the 19th century.  Do you think the Oklahoma legislators wants the AP course to cover those topics? I'm guessing not. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Control of Congress has allowed the Republican Party to defer its public campaign against Mr. Obamas initiatives, since they are dead on arrival. But the G.O.P. will not have that luxury in 2016, when it will need to offer a more cogent and specific response than it has so far.

I'm sure they'll go with the usual, a tax break that largely goes to the wealthy. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, we do want to encourage that Entrepreneurial Spirit.  And you got to work with what you got. But seriously, I think its largely a way to throw another obstacle in the way of our poorest citizens.  If they were really interested in reducing people cheating the government, they'd go after contractor fraud or tax cheating. That would save us a lot more money than food stamp ID's. </TEXT>

Furthermore, the travails of workers in rich countries are, in important ways, the flip side of the gains above and below them. Competition from emerging-economy exports has surely been a factor depressing wages in wealthier nations, although probably not the dominant force. More important, soaring incomes at the top were achieved, in large part, by squeezing those below: by cutting wages, slashing benefits, crushing unions, and diverting a rising share of national resources to financial wheeling and dealing.
