	<TEXT> Hey can you add this to [This Thread?](http://www.reddit.com/r/chicago/comments/2cuasb/pickup_soccer_innear_lincoln_park_meetup_is/)

A number of us from r/chicago met up at Wrightwood Park this morning to play some small sided games. We'd like for you to join us in the near future. 

u/TraptInaCommentFctry was the guy who organized today, and we'll be looking to get a bigger group together for the next one.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's really hard for me to hate Fleury; in fact, it was really hard to get excited about the Hawks in the early 2000s. Like the writer of the blog, I was watching the Wolves win Turner Cups and Calder Cups during this era, and learning that Fleury was coming to the Hawks was exciting. True, he didn't perform; he was out of shape and on a bad team, not to mention that he was suicidal during his stay in Chicago. When the team is only good enough to win 30 games in a season, guys like Fleury, Sullivan, and heck even Kyle Calder provided rare bright spots in a dreary season.

Funny enough, I actually found an autographed copy of his book "Playing with Fire" in a used bookstore last night. The chapter on Chicago gives a great perspective on his performance here. I was laughing in the bookstore after reading Brian Sutter's quote. "Theo, you're in fucking horrible shape."   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> First of all your idea of DC people being uptight workaholics is true. Now add politically charged to that. Thank God I'm back in Chicago where people distrust politicians enough to not wear their political views on their sleeves. 

As you probably know, DC is EXPENSIVE! Here you will never pay $4.35 for a damn train ride one way within the city. I'm not sure what neighborhood you live in, but the wife and I made more than $90k per year in DC and we had a mediocre 1BR apartment on the west end of Alexandria, VA for $1300/mo... and literally DIRT for a front lawn. Here, you will get a lot more for your money if you're a renter. No it isn't cheap (sales tax..ahhhh), but by DC standards it would be a breath of fresh air. 

Now here are my biased opinions:
 
-Chicago Art Institute  National Gallery of Art/ *any* Smithsonian Museum

-Museum of Science and Industry  Smithsonian Space whatever-the-hell-it's-called museum 

-Chicago lake front  National Mall

-Chicago hot dog  DC-3 (which has some damn good hot dogs)

-Deep dish pizza  $60 sushi roll or whatever people go out and eat in DC

-Mariano's   Jewel-Osco  Giant or Harris Teeter

-Chicago's grid system of roads  Than the 6 miles of traffic circles on Mass Ave that will take you 1.5 hours to drive down.

-Bears   Blackhawks  Racist Redskins or creatively named "Caps"

-Chinatown = Chinatown, but Chicago also has Korea town + Argyle Street (mini- SE Asia)... Get into Vietnamese subs!

-Wicker Park  H Street 

-Have to say I haven't experienced much of the Pride celebration here in Chicago (always avoided the huge crowds), but DC Pride was pretty huge, my guess is that it stacks up. 

In summary, you'll find what you're looking for here in Chicago. Move here if you can get a solid job lined up! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It seems like the giant open-ice hits that have generated so many injuries and suspensions in this past decade were a result of minimizing all of the clutching and grabbing that went uncalled in the past. At least my observation is that a majority of the *dirty hits* that we've come to know (mainly the ones involving a guy on a stretcher) are coming in a post 2005 NHL. 

Not to say that the 80s game wasn't full of dirty plays, just on a different level.  </TEXT>
