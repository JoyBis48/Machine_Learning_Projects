	<TEXT> Everyone here is going to talk about the seasons/weather, so I will just say get ready for traffic.  You said Lowell, which is a former mill town north west of Boston.  There's a University there and a couple community colleges holding the city together IMHO.  Not much of a nightlife unless you call banging down bud lights with your bros until 2 in the morning a nightlife.  Sure there are concerts and whatnot like any city.  I guess you just have to move here and check out the scene.  But be prepared for poverty, drug use (especially heroin), a lot of crime. </TEXT>

His first instrument was the 5 string banjo.  A lot of people don't know that.  His mom played one.  He always wanted a guitar, but both his mom and his Aunt forbade him from becoming a musician because of his loser dad (a professional cruise ship musician).   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's slow, but it works.  Every time.  

You've probably heard about one of our great musical historians, Chief O'Neil of Chicago.  Right?  He was an incredible dude.  Seriously.  He couldn't read music, but he remembered melodies by "rehearsing" them over and over in his head like you or I "rehearse" addresses or telephone numbers.  He would follow people around on street cars in the city, listen to the tunes they were singing or humming and go back to his office where a colleague who could write music wrote them down.

	<TEXT> PAO comes from the chinese name Bao

Last name origins   meanings:

Chinese: there are three different surnames that are Romanized in pinyin as Bao. Other Romanizations include Bau, Pao, and Pau.
Chinese:  this character also means abalone, but the name comes from an old place name. The area of Bao was granted to a chief counselor of the state of Qi during the Spring and Autumn period (722481 bc). His son took the place name as his surname and was called Bao Shuya. Bao Shuya was famous for his lofty moral character and was skilled at delegating authority, eventually becoming the first Chief King of the Spring and Autumn period.

Chinese:  this Chinese character means to wrap or package. The name is derived from the name of Shen Baoxu. Shen Baoxu was a senior official who lived 2500 years ago in the state of Chu. When the state of Chu was attacked by the state of Wu, Shen Baoxu went to the State of Qin to beg for aid. There, he reportedly cried for seven days and nights until the duke of Qin was moved to help rescue the state of Chu.

Chinese:  this character means (violently) sudden. It comes from the name of Bao Xingong, a duke during the Yin dynasty (14011122 bc). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I believe it was inevitable that this happened.

First we needed online 24/7 with all the social anonymity it offers (nobody can see you're a girl or a boy when you comment or share)

Then we needed a couple generations to grow up with that permanent access

Young women of this generation (post 1995) have learned that what they say and do online is as good or as valid as anybody else.  It's probably the first generation that is completely empowered to be whatever they want to be without the judgement usually associated with sex/gender.

I think it's a good thing and I'm eager to watch and learn </TEXT>

If your instrument is not sounding well, consider a set up from a real luthier.  A new (solid) bridge, a neck adjustment, different strings, fret work, a new tailpiece...all of these will have more of a demonstrable result than a piece of metal that clips onto your instrument.

FWIW a good set up is a requirement whether you play a cheap chinese instrument or a handmade luthier built one </TEXT>
