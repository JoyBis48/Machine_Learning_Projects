The dad raised the child as normal, but one day the kid disappeared when he went off on his own to check out something. The dad then devoted his life to finding his kid, even if it meant traveling across the ocean. He had the help of a mentally ill silly woman. Together, they find his son Nemo and they are happily reunited.  </TEXT>

It just gives you something to make some money while chatting or talkingabout something with your friends. If you are just going in with random people sitting there in silence while playing, you're gonna have a bad time. ( and 20k on ammo! Do you only play with sticky bombs or something? </TEXT>
