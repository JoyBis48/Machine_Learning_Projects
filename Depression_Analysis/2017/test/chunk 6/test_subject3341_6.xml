	<TITLE> How do I tell a J. Crew Factory OCBD from a regular J. Crew one? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-10-15 14:45:36 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I have recently gotten into thrifting and frequent a thrift shop that gets a lot of J. Crew OCBDs. 

I have heard of the quality difference between J. Crew and J. Crew Factory, with JCF being of substantially lower quality and fit. Obviously if given the option between the two I would go with regular J. Crew; unfortunately to my untrained eye it's hard for me to tell the difference.

I know about the two diamonds under the tag to indicate factory status, however all the J. Crew tags I see either look like [this](http://i742.photobucket.com/albums/xx66/applky/IMG_2930.jpg) or [this](http://i996.photobucket.com/albums/af86/oboy_oboy/IMG_0530.jpg). I have never seen diamonds on the tags of any of the J. Crew OCBDs I have seen. 

How can I tell the difference just from sight?

I can get the OCBDs at $16.50 to $18.50. Is this a good deal? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Interesting. Uniqlo's sizing charts peg the slim-fit OCBDs at a full 1 inch smaller in body width than the flannels. I have both on the way in size small so we will see I guess. 

*Edit: Just received my Uniqlo flannels. Two of the three flannels I got fit me absolutely beautifully; the third was overly baggy and fit like a drape. All three were in size small so I guess there are variants between the fit. Once my OCBDs come I will compare the fit to the ones that fit me well.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Are these J.Crew chino measurements correct? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-10-06 23:01:29 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I was browsing the J.Crew sale today and I wanted to get a few final sale chinos, but I don't want to mess up the size. After a little researching I came across [this](http://www.styleforum.net/t/181128/slim-fit-chino-j-crew-urban-vs-bb-milano) forum. If you scroll a little down you can see some charts that are supposedly the real measurements for their chinos; however, they don't seem to be right at all. I have a 35" hip and I usually wear size 29 or 30 but according to this chart even the smallest 28 would fall right off me. 

Can anyone who has a pair of J.Crew chinos validate the sizes on this chart? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I remember when I was in high school (only a few years ago) I wore size 32 Levi's and those felt a little tight on me. Now size 30 AEO slim fit jeans slip off my waist without a belt. 

Has anyone else experienced something similar? I'm pretty sure my waist has only grown in size since high school. My true waist size is 35", if that matters at all </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi!

I am selling my Asus R9 270x, used about half a year. This card has never been used for mining, and has only been slightly overclocked. Still in great condition, only a little dusty since I don't have access to compressed air. Comes with everything I got it with, including the original box, molex adapters, crossfire cable, etc. I could play Battlefield 4 on Ultra settings with this! Asking $110 shipped OBO. 

I am also considering selling my Gigabyte GTX 770 2GB. I have only used this for about a month, never overclocked. I bought it as a present to myself not realizing that the 900 series would be released so soon, and my return window just passed :( I would like it so I can get some money back for a 970, but I am in no rush to sell it. Make me an offer and I will see if I am willing to part ways with it :) I am looking at somewhere in the realm of $225 shipped.

This is my first swap, but I promise I won't scam you! 

Thanks for looking! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My SteelSeries Flux In-Ears went through the wash and I need a new pair of IEMs!

**Budget** - ~$100

**Source** - Primarily phone, I have other full sized headphones for desk use.

**Isolation** - Would be appreciated, though with IEMs it's pretty much a given. 

**Type** - These need to be IEMs. 

**Tonal Balance** - Looking for something more fun? I own a pair of Grado SR325e and I really love how fun they make music sound. 

**Past Headphones** - Too many to list. Serious headphones include Grado SR325e, ATH-M50s, Beyerdynamic DTX 101 iE (though I was very disappointed in the sound of these) and my SteelSeries Flux In-Ears, which were the first IEMs that made me say "wow". 

Looking at Havi B3 Pro-1 and Philips Fidelio S1.

Thanks! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Just wait until you get on campus and go to your first class to purchase any books for that class. Then you will know for sure whether or not you really need the textbook instead of spending a lot of money now on a textbook you won't use at all. You won't be at a disadvantage either since you will probably not use the book at all for the first few weeks anyways, giving you a lot of time to get the right book if you really need it. 

If you MUST get a book now, the textbook that most algebra and calculus classes use is Essential Calculus: Early Transcendentals (Amazon [here](http://www.amazon.com/Essential-Calculus-Transcendentals-James-Stewart/dp/1133112285)). The demand is very high for this book so if you buy it now and find out you don't need it you could sell it to some other freshman very easily. 

Easiest case is just to wait until you really know what book your class uses and if you really need it or not.  </TEXT>

If you're waiting a while before purchase see how much money you have when you want to buy, and how much the Surface Pro 2 goes down in price. I think your decision will be much clearer then.  </TEXT>
