Where? The article and news report both state he was her client.

Edit: Also, as to your third point, they were clearly outside of court and likely had just attended some sort of preliminary hearing. What authority backs up your assertion that this scenario qualifies as an "ongoing police investigation"? I ask because your admonition about commenting without knowing the law implies that you yourself actually do. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  It is not unforeseeable that community leaders would just appoint judges who will do what they want.

The governor of the state would likely be the person appointing judges. Judicial elections are awful. Generally, the electorate has no idea who is a good judge or who would make a good judge. The end result is that the local legal community (i.e., the "community leaders" you fear would be in charge were judges appointed) decides who wins. And that is a very tainted process.

Edit: I'd also like to point out that many states - like mine - have a hybrid system. If a judge retires before the expiration of his or her term, the Governor appoints his or her replacement. What's the net effect? Almost every judge retires before the end of their term. And since incumbent judges almost never lose, we essentially have an appointment process already.

Edit2: Also, even assuming races will be competitive, what is the likely pool of candidates? Attorneys. This means that if you run against a judge or lose in an open election, you run the risk of facing a less-than-favorable judge in court. This greatly discourages competitive races in places where judges are elected. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is just how we do things here.

No it isn't. _See_, the Civil Rights Act of 1964. How we _actually_ do things here is to weigh rights versus state interests. If your religion requires that you murder your child for being raped, that is outweighed by the state's interest in preventing murder.

It's a complicated constitutional area but a good starting place is to Google "levels of scrutiny constitutional law". </TEXT>

	<TEXT> None of the rights in the Constitution is absolute. For example, your religion may sanction honor killing, but murder is still illegal and that doesn't violate the First Amendment.

Southern Baptists thought interracial marriage violated their religious beliefs, but that doesn't mean interracial couples must cede their rights to marriage equality.

It's a lot more complicated than your post implies. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I guess I just don't see it. I'm born and raised as well (except for school) but my parents attended Augusta College, as have countless friends and family.

To me, it's just a name. I also don't get upset when people do whatever to the American flag. It's just a flag. And if the choice is between a great school without "Augusta" in its name, and a lesser school with it, I would choose the former without a thought. I don't think that was the choice but damned if everyone wasn't ready to torpedo the merger just to save the name.

And you're right, I don't have much patience for Augusta hate. But I don't see this as having anything to do with that. Georgia State, Georgia Southern, UGA, Mercer, Emory, etc., don't include the name of the city they are in, so it's not like Augusta was being singled out.

As for the level of involvement, I don't think it's beneficial in and of itself. Hell, this city went apeshit supporting Chick-fil-A as well and that was nothing more than bigotry. </TEXT>

If it's done with the intent of filing bankruptcy, yes, it's likely fraud. The difficult part is proving it. Plus, you're generally dealing with debts in the thousands so most major credit companies don't view it as a worthwhile fight (the big fraud fights I see are in Chapter 11s - business bankruptcies -  because the debts are in the millions).

It can be an embarrassing process but most people I run across view it in retrospect as a very simple process. The worst part is generally the self-inflicted shame.

Edit: And it sounds like you are on a much better path now: "No more credit card bills, and proper payment arrangements made with the doctors offices. I don't ever plan to do get into a mess like that again." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In practice, most people who file a Chapter 7 will not lose anything. Each state has bankruptcy exemptions based on categories of property. Any property up to the value of the exemption is protected from your creditors in bankruptcy.

	<TEXT> *in a Chapter 13.

A Chapter 13 is a repayment plan; a Chapter 7 is a liquidation. Judgments can be taken care of in both but in the latter, the judgment creditor will not get any payment.

In practice, most judgments are avoidable and the underlying debts dischargeable. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Bankruptcy attorneys who know what they are doing will require payment up front for a Chapter 7 (which sounds like what you filed). If not, the remaining fee is a pre-petition debt that gets stayed and discharged just like any other. Importantly, the client could potentially sue the attorney for violating the stay if any collection efforts are made (such as calling for a payment).

Of course, if you hire a bankruptcy attorney who agrees to a post-petition payment plan with the intention of not paying (because you now know the above), that's probably fraud and not dischargeable. </TEXT>
