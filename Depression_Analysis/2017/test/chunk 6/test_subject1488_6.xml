	<TEXT> I'll be honest here, stop crying about not having a cell phone. That's not your biggest problem and you need to step back and look at what you're saying. Get a track phone if you're so worried about it. Go to a library and apply for jobs. Ask for them to contact you via email. Go in person and hope for open interviews or an on the spot hire. You got this. If you can't afford a track phone (I think they're like $10/month), ask /r/assistance for help. Good luck, chief. </TEXT>
