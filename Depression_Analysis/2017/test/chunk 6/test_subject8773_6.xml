	<TEXT> Yeah, you might wanna get that changed out or something. But mine cost about that much. Where i live, generally the type of jewelry will determine whether it costs 35, 45, or 55 dollars for the piercing. I dont think you have much to worry about other than the fact that you have a hoop in instead of a curved barbell.. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Your third paragraph makes a lot of sense. And I definitely understand that. I'm just saying I've had a realllyyyyyy hard time getting a word in about my experience as a lightskinned mixed girl, and I think that our group could benefit from varying perspectives, because I've seen other mixed girls be shunned like I have in other settings. I never even suggest that my experiences are as severe, and in fact I acknowledge it. It would just be nice for someone to know that there is this problem of not fitting in with the black community or the white community, which to me is a little ironic. 

Also, about the bisexuality piece, it's funny that you mention that, I've experienced that too actually! I am bisexual. Thank you for posting this, everything you said I've totally been able to identify with.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Exactly. It's really hard though, there isn't anyone else who seems to have the same experiences and all of the light-skinned people in the room introduce themselves as "allies." It's so difficult when I'm met with so much opposition and people just laugh at me and brush it off, and when I'm offended, I don't have a right to be offended because they think what theyre doing isnt really damaging and that I'm being a baby.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So, I'll start out with saying I'm part black (from my mom's side). I can pass as white, but people mostly think that I am hispanic. 

My whole life, my mother was the one who was there for me and raised me and taught me about racism and oppression, as well as helped me through bad racial experiences. For example, in fifth grade, I got microbraids and a girl in my class scoffed at me, told me they were ugly, and that they were for "real" black people. 

Now, I've tried to get involved with Black Student Unity on my university campus and I won't lie. The questions they asked me and the things they assume are sometimes just as ignorant as when white people come up to me and start splurting out random racist bullshit. The black community likes to say "So how are you even black? Which side is it from? Is your mom light skinned or something? You're not really black, you're mostly European." And then the kicker, "You're not even that black, you probably haven't even experienced much oppression and racism." UM, hello  And it makes me super uncomfortable and angry because I do mostly identify as African American. I'm not saying I don't have more privilege, I definitely do and I won't deny that my experiences might not be as extreme, but that doesn't mean my experiences should be brushed off. There are many ways to be black and the black community is not one lumped together homogeneous group.They also criticize me for dating a white guy, saying if i were really black then I'd want to date a black guy, which is SO. STUPID. 

THEN, there's the white community, who I'm not "white enough" for. I get told I'm "exotic," I have to basically argue with people to convince them that my mom is black, but then they tell me that I'm not black enough to fully identify as a black person. But obviously I'm not white enough to identify as a white person either, so what am I supposed to do?

Anyway, I could go on forever about it but I really needed the black community at my university because it's predominantly white and it would have been nice to hang out with people of similar cultural background, but they weren't accepting whatsoever. Does anyone else who is multiracial experience this? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Please take that out! Like /u/daveoldham131 said, it's way too deep and if you leave that in your nipple is going to swallow it up. Research some good piercers in your area, and have someone take a look at it. They'll probably tell you the same thing and tell you where you can go from there.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's actually what I thought at first, but I originally had jewelry that was too small, so i developed pockets on either sides of my nipples that now stick out, so they look too deep but are actually at the base of my nipple.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Right, and that's really good, but there are forces that will try to make you feel guilty for being who you are other than religion, too. Sometimes when you're young and you discover these things about yourself, you get older and it tires you out that people constantly demand that you explain yourself when you shouldn't have to. I know that in my experience, I grow weary of the prejudice, even as I learn to stand up for myself. And the worst part is that it comes from people a lot of times that you've known your whole life and that you're really close to. 

You should also know that sexuality is a fluid, dynamic thing, and it changes and grows while you change and grow. It's okay not to be able to call yourself one thing, or discover that you think you actually might be more of one thing that another. There are a lot of people who are out there who will call themselves your supporters, yet you feel judgement coming from them because they believe that you are free to do what you want and have your own preferences, but you must choose an identity and call yourself that. That's something that will be really hard as well, people who don't understand that it is okay to be in a constant state of not knowing. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well usually identifying as bisexual means attracted to both males and females , but pansexuality is not limited to just male and female. Pansexuality means you are attracted to male, female, and even more complicated combinations of sexualities and gender identities than that, like transgendered people, and so on. I know that it's confusing, but some people don't even just identify as one gender or the other, and some people have had sex changes, or are going through hormone replacement therapy. Pansexuality covers that wide range.

	<TEXT> I say good for you! I didn't realize ( or come to terms with, I should probably say) my sexuality until this past year, and I'm 19 going on 20. I'm glad that you can be sure of yourself so young. 

If I had to give you any advice, I would say be strong and keep going on being confident in knowing who you are. Don't let anyone tell you that youre wrong, or that it's just a phase. I had the feelings that I feel now when I was a young child but coming from a Catholic upbringing and being told homoerotic tendencies were a sin made me stuff that part of myself deep down. I still feel a little guilt about it.

Also, you might end up finding out you have "friends" who can't seem to accept that part of you. It's going to suck, but you have to be prepared to explain things you shouldn't have to to people when they find out, like "no, I'm not half gay and half straight" or "no, I'm not greedy." That was the hardest part for me, telling people that I wasn't going through some "crazy college girl" phase and that it was a legitimate part of my identity.    </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I just have to say one thing, if your therapist has diagnosed you with something you don't think is true, please get a second and third opinion. She is going to treat you based on what she thinks you have. 

Also, if it's possible, it might be a good idea to seek out a different therapist. Your therapist isn't supposed to bother you. Your therapist is  supposed make you face uncomfortable things, but is not supposed to bother you as a person. You know what I'm saying? </TEXT>
