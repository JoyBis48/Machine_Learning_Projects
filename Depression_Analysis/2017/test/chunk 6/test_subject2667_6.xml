And you found one supposed false accusation, never mind that there's no web link. Congratulations. 

We have politicians like Bobby Jindal claiming there are no-go zones when that has been debunked. We have people frothing at the mouth when you don't call terrorism "Islamic" or "Muslim," never mind that most of the victims are Muslims, and we have people claiming that Muslims don't condemn terrorism.

He could wear a white suit, have a combed haircut and start spouting off how terrible he was before he met Bo and started bolieving. They could do that victory lap holding each other's arms high. 

**EDIT:** Suit not suite. He can't wear a nice hotel room. It's also spelled "bo-lieve." </TEXT>
