	<TITLE> New Science Feature: Science Discussions! </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-05-10 17:11:21 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Today we announce a new feature in /r/science, **Science Discussions**.  These are text posts made by verified users about issues relevant to the scientific community.  

The basic idea is that our practicing scientists will post a text post describing an issue or topic to open a discussion with /r/science.  Users may then post comments to enter the conversation, either to add information or ask a question to better understand the issue, which may be new to them.  Knowledgeable users may chime in to add more depth of information, or a different point of view.  

This is, however, not a place for political grandstanding or flame wars, so the discussion will be moderated, **be on your best behavior**.  If you can't disagree without being disagreeable, it's best to not comment at all.

That being said, we hope you enjoy quality discussions lead by experience scientists about science-related issues of the day.

Thanks for reading /r/science, and happy redditing!

	<TITLE> Do you have a college degree or higher in science? Get flair indicating your expertise in /r/science! </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-05-02 03:39:57 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> ##**Science Verified User Program**

/r/science has a a system of verifying accounts for commenting, enabling trained scientists, doctors and engineers to make credible comments in /r/science . The intent of this program is to enable the general public to distinguish between an educated opinion and a random comment without a background related to the topic. 


#**What flair is available?**

All of the standard science disciplines would be represented, matching those in the sidebar.
However, to better inform the public, the level of education is displayed in the flair too. For example, a Professor of biology is tagged as such (Professor- Biology), while a graduate student of biology is tagged as "Grad Student-Biology." Nurses would be tagged differently than doctors, etc...

We give flair for engineering, social sciences, natural sciences and even on occasion music.  It's your flair, if you finished a degree in something and you can offer some proof, we'll consider it.

The general format is:

Level of education|Field|Speciality or Subfield (optional)

When applying for a flair, please inform us on what you want it to say.

#**How does one obtain flair?**


First, have a college degree or higher in a field that has flair available.
Then send proof to the mods of /r/science .

This can be provided several ways:

1) [Message the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fscience) with information that establishes your claim, this can be a photo of your diploma or course registration, a business card, a verifiable email address, or some other identification. All submissions will be kept in confidence and not released to the public under any circumstances. You can submit an imgur link and then delete it after verification. 

Remember, that within the proof, you must tie your account name to the information in the picture.


2) if you aren't comfortable messaging the mods with identifying information, you can directly message any individual mod and supply the information to them. Again, your information will be held in confidence.


3) Send an email with your information to sciencereddit@gmail.com after messaging the mods to inform them of this option. Your email will then be deleted after verification, leaving no record. 

This is convenient if you want to take a photo of your identification and email from a smart phone, for example.


Thanks for making /r/science a better place!

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> First off, I don't think this can be done, but I'd very much like to be wrong.

We in /r/science would like to track the number of readers who look at our AMAs, we get a lot of requests for the information and right now I have to email the admins and wait for them to get back to me with a number, I can't look at changes over time, or any other handy stats to let us know how people are using our AMAs. 

If we could embed a smart pixel via CSS we could gather some data on this, but it appears that all of the images that the subreddit CSS pulls need to be hosted on a reddit server, which would make our tracking pixel just a pixel.

Any thoughts on how to do this or am I stuck continually harassing people to get data?
