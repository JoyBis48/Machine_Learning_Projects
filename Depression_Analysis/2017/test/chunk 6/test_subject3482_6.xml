	<TEXT> If browser wasn't an option, I would say camera. I wouldn't mind carrying an iPad /kindle around for reading, and small radio for music, but to carry around a point and shoot is way too clunky.

and you know what - that kinda describes the evolution of the mobile phone. Camera was almost universally the first feature added after calls and texts.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Candidly - you can't cram for such an interview. Also if you do get the job by pretending to know 12+ technologies, you are just setting yourself up for failure on the job which can be detrimental to your reputation in the long run.

Brush up on the 4-5 things you know and make sure you come across really strong and confident in those areas. If they probe on the other areas - be clear and confident that although you aren't up to speed on the other topics - you are a fast learner, are eager to contribute and build a skill set and be a positive force at the job.

Our best bet is coming across as earnest, hardworking and very knowledgable at the things you do know. Sometimes the most powerful thing to say in an interview is "I am not skilled at that but I intend to learn it very quickly and have experience with other similar technologies today". If you try and fake it, you will get caught out either at the interview, or later on the job.  

Good luck.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree with your point. I have used those tools and the quality of international engineers is a huge positive surprise. Its no where near as good as working side by side with someone but as collaboration tools get better and better, it's much easier to work with someone really talented in Eastern Europe or Asia (I find Latam / Eastern Europe easier from a timezone perspective than Asia)

So the bigger worry than H1Bs is really these tools (odesk / upwork) becoming more mainstream and moving up the value chain, and unlike H1B's which are regulated strongly, there is no way to protect an American workforce from technological changes like this.

The only way forward has to be continued and easy access to training and education. 

In all the focus on STEM majors by the tech world and increasingly by politicians, what is forgotten is that the US has some of the best liberal arts schools in the world, and the combination of the humanities and technology is potent. Other countries can easy produce great programmers, but they are unlikely to produce great technologists in the same volume with a well-rounded, broad-based skill set. 

The path forward for the US cannot be purely STEM but access to STEM+business / arts / design / humanities in a high quality, easy and affordable way.

The biggest outsourcing worry we have is that college is way too expensive and delivers too little value for the money.

	<TEXT> Candidly - not really. The 1.5 years is just a guideline. I think it looks bad if you leave a job too early, and you miss out on the chance to really evaluate the job / company. Don't fret on the exact number of months, but make sure you feel like you can talk to a holistic experience at that job.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I can suggest the following rule-of-thumb:
1. If you have already done more than a 1.5 years in your current job, you should always be looking. Doesn't have to mean sending your resume out to 100s of other companies, but look at the job sites and see what piques your interest. This regular market check makes sure you aren't just staying out of inertia.
2. Before that period - its too early to judge a job or a company (unless its downright nasty)

Rule of thumb 3 (assuming you are competent at your current job and the issues you describe aren't performance related as it sounds like from your post) - push for more responsibility. As in take it on - don't ask. Pioneer a special project that the company needs badly but no one has gotten around to take ownership (large companies have tons of those), try and take the initiative. If you feel like that is getting noticed and appreciated, and as a result you are enjoying the job more - its a good place to be. If you feel like people are resistant, you are getting more questions than support - then its time to leave.

I have absolutely stayed at a company too long. And sometimes the job gets different, but not better but it "feels" like its better. I have found only when I push for more responsibility and try and take charge of my career, I get a sense for the real values / culture of the company and then my decision is clear. </TEXT>
