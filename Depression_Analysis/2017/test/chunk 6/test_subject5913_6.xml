	<TEXT> I'm having a hard time believing it does. I've been diagnosed with depression, this past April but I've been living with it since 2008( when I started high school). It got worse once my mother died and when my closest friends and I went our separate ways once we graduated high school. There are a lot of other factors that's causing my depression( being attracted to women, wishing I was born a man, wishing I wasn't black, never being intimate with someone) which has caused me to gain so much weight. Since I graduated from my trade school, last month, I tried to start working out, but stop because of a terrible pain in my lower back and left leg. That really messed with my head. I want to get better, but it's like my body doesn't want me to. My anxiety prevents me from going outside. I feel very ashamed to be seen outside. I live in Germany with my dad( we're American). I don't want to be seen by people because I always get stared at, it makes me feel worse about myself. I know Europeans(or anyone, really) don't like fat people, so I hate myself so much for what I am. I want to get better, get in shape, but I feel so hopeless. All my friends are married, having children, and here I am, the loneliest I've ever been in my life. I don't know if I can make it, any longer. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you for this. I've been trying to motivate myself to get into shape, but I'm not sure what I should do first. Like, what do I eat? Will I even have time to prepare meals, everyday? If I go to the gym ,how do I know, no one's going to take photos of me and post them on some place like reddit, to mock me? I see that happening a lot. It really terrifies me :/ 
It causes me so much anxiety. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've been curious about this. I worry that I'm automatically nixed when it comes to dating. Now granted, I've never been in a relationship, before, let alone dated anyone, before. This sounds really silly, but stuff like this, and other horrible things I've read on reddit, (i.e r/fatpeoplehate or r/talesoffathate. Yes, I'm not in shape, and I know people are certainly not attracted to overweight folks) has definitely effected my self esteem. 
I'm just curious to know what you guys think.  </TEXT>
