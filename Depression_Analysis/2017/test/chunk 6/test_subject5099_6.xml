	<TITLE> DvZ Update 3/22 - Map Changes </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-03-23 02:20:27 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> After several Test games run by Nisovin, a very small update was rolled out to Dogekac and Daragor, plus a removal of a certain mob.

* **Dogekac** was known for having a large amount of **holes in the bedrock** to bypass certain areas, such as at the front of the keep, there being holes under the lights, straight to the Inner Shrine. **These holes are now filled in.**
* Speaking of **Inner Shrine**...It **was removed**, there are now two shrines. The Bridge Shrine, and the Final Shrine.
* **Daragor's mob spawn was pushed back**, the tools tables were moved slightly over, and many trees were added abouts the front. The **mob protection is slightly forward**, to about **4 or so blocks infront of the shovel table.**
* ~~Unless the RNG was being very harsh to the **Spider Kings** in the games I played, they are **removed.**~~  *Saw some in a Dogekac game, JT is wroooooooooooooooooooong.*
* **Armor is not throwable anymore**, it will teleport back into your inventory.  ~~This means you CANNOT be rearmored.~~ *Unless, of course, all of your armor breaks.*


* You can now be rearmored if you are missing a piece of your armor, such as a helmet, and it will be re-equipped. No need to drop all your armor anymore. (Thanks Nis!)

The reason I use two pots is because when I played on the UHC reddit, I liked to have pick, sword, bow. So I was never accustom to changing that system and using hotkeys, so I prefer to keep my bow and sword together.  </TEXT>

He also spawns with 5ish one use items, that are very overpowered, but hurt the dwarves too, such as killing all the monsters at once, but also killing a few dwarves, or giving every dwarf a 30 second proc, but unarmoring half the dwarves too. The Shepherd of Fire may have 10 items that he CAN spawn with, but may only relieve 5 or so, making every Shepherd unique. </TEXT>

He uses Orion, the silver blade, that deals more damage than a runeblade but not as much as Excaliju, and when it procs, produces large amounts of fireworks that blind the monsters (this may or may not work, depending on if it crashes players or not). Orion is passed down by DeathSeeker lineage, and only one that uses the blade, can have that title, and only one DeathSeeker can exist at one time. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> More balancement changes, and reintroduction of an old map.

* Daragor has been readded, using the multiple shrine system, has 3 shrines: the Gate Shrine, the Juice Shrine, and the Final Shrine, each on a layer of the map.
* Armor, when repaired, gives 160 durability per repair, rather than 100 from before.
* When dropped, an armor piece ends up in oblivion, and is gone forever. (Remember, if you require a new set, throw away ALL of your old set.)
* Mount Willakers' shrines were reduced to two: the Courtyard Shrine behind the front wall, and the Final Shrine.
* Each map has a monster spawn debuff/protection, that deals a dwarf nausea and a bit of poison if within the radius. (This has the unfortunate effect of blocking dwarves from the cave on Dogekac, unsure if intentional or not.) The debuff is the same amount of nausea, but the poison starts as a very low amount, and then after about 5 seconds, becomes poison III.
* Dogekac's lobby is no longer destructable.
* **As of the 27th,** Dogekac's shrines were changed as well, to 3 shrines: Bridge, Inner, Final. **THIS IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE** </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Your last point would be extremely cruel, because we just want to play games like anyone else, that's why titles don't have  more powerful weapons (with the exception of the Staff, dealing an extra half heart) so I see no reason why we should be hindered, just because we are titled. There are plenty of people without titles that are better than me, and they wouldn't be hindered. Also, I see no reason to nerf procs, and rob has mentioned before, he will not do any rebalancing until after heroes are reintroduced, but I think procs are fine, in my opinion. </TEXT>
