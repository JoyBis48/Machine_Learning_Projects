	<TEXT> I'm the same way, I can take all the red veins I want, and I can take green Bali, but any other green and any white veins make me feel like shit.. along with Maeng Da, too. I'm so envious of people that can take a white or green vein and catch a good energy buzz before work. I'm always falling asleep on my fuckin way to work. Lol. I would like to take just Bali in the mornings but more than a couple grams of it gives me fuckin nausea.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, he obviously has some deep-seated issues. I attempted to skim through all his drivel and I'm pretty sure he's on probation and he lives in Florida where kratom might be outlawed soon. He'll have to come to terms with his own drug dependence soon and he's afraid, so he's lashing out. Hey, this armchair psychology stuff is pretty fun. I can almost see why he does it. Wait... no... no, I can't. He's just a stupid asshole. Yes. That's it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So he chooses to be on kratom instead of hard drugs, and you say he's doing the wrong thing... yet you're forced to resort to kratom because you aren't allowed to do hard drugs, and you think you're doing the right thing? That's definitely backwards junkie mentality if I've ever seen it. You're just a fiend doing whatever substances you can get away with. Admitting you're a junkie doesn't make your actions better than his. Stop glorifying yourself. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Alright, so we all know extracts can fuck up your tolerance. I don't have much experience with extracts, I got some several years ago but I was shooting dope daily and therefore I never really felt it when I took it. Well, today I was on HS ordering some of my usual Green Bali and the Red Vein Thai/Gold Standard extract caught my eye, so I decided to order 2 grams of it. Does anybody have any experience with that product specifically from HS? How was it? My usual dose is around 5-6 grams, should I just take the whole 2 grams?  Is one dose of this extract going to fuck my tolerance up all that bad? Thanks in advance. </TEXT>
