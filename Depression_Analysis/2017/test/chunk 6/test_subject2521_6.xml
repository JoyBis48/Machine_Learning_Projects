	<TEXT> It is great to see that someone is taking the time to break down and understand the social issues portrayed in each episode. I do that for most episodes and my boyfriend thinks I am crazy. Try it sometime, you may be surprised of what you can learn, and further understand, just by watching the show. 

The Simpsons did something like this during their first few seasons. I have yet to figure out why they stopped. Either way, I lost interest in the show.

I've come to the conclusion you'll have a 1 in 10 chance of finding something worth reading or watching each day. But even then, the stories often suck and include nothing but gossip like reporting. </TEXT>

Smoke some weed, sit back, and enjoy the video.

There are also several temp agencies along Iowa St.

Hope that helps.... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have used this vet since moving to Lawrence nearly a decade ago.  Even though there are a wide range of veterinarians in the Lawrence area, CPAH is the only location in town that grooms cats. 

I agree with /u/SmirkingRevenge that they are somewhat pricey, but it is well worth the few extra bucks. I have never been dissatisfied and they have a very knowledgeable staff. Unlike vets I have gone to in the past, they will actually explain everything to you and let you know the best options for your pet, instead of trying to sell you things your pet does not need.

	<TEXT> I was not sure if I should write it with just my approach, or to include my brothers in finding out. I will go ahead and make everything singular. I am more concerned about my own finding out, not my brothers. 

Should I remove that sentence from the first paragraph and leave it as is, without adding more information - my name and finding out? I'll definitely continue with the 'wanting to meet you' at the end of the letter. Also requesting a reply is a better way to approach the subject.

Going too far in-depth with the 23andMe is too much? He's in his early-to-late 70s and I am uncertain whether or not he's that tech savvy, and would have any idea what I was referring to. 

Thank you so much for your advice, I truly appreciate it!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I dropped my Google Nexus 5 last Thursday and cracked the screen. It's an hour away and receiving some special care. It has been a week and I feel empty. Our separation has had a devastating impact on my life.

Nah, I'm rather well. Frustrated of the fact I procrastinated on buying a case, but that's what I get. The only downside is the fact I can't text my best-friend. Emailing will work for now, but texting is a lot easier...plus sending pictures is way easier than using my DSLR, uploading the pictures, and sending. 

I spend less time reading Digg posts and whatever I come across on reddit. Plus I've spent a lot of my time reading about my favorite subject - art therapy. All in all, the separation was for the better. Everything might change once I have it back.  </TEXT>
