	<TEXT> The MRSA foundation, a California based 501 non-profit, has a website not a blog . Also don't take the word conspiracy so seriously. Most /r/conspiracy posts are not true conspiracy's but rather  is a subreddit where people can post unconventional ideas and have open minded people look at them . Think abstraction not literal. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> On my youtube channel there is my half-finished patent-free mrsa infection prototype medicial machine. I have spent over $2,000 of my own money building it. I am giving idea away patent and compensation free. I do not work for any company but rather understand the pain this flesh eating disease brings. It's called empathy folks. Something some of the nasty people on r/technology don't understand. If you don't agree with me downvote me.

	<TEXT> I love reddit but what they did too my successful post was uncalled for. Also, unlike this post, I posted a MRSA foundation webpage not my youtube video.I may have an idea which could save millions of lives and save governments billions of dollars. Last year 700,000 people died from mrsa, I know how to treat it. If you disagree with me than down vote me. Don't censor me /u/ProtoDong. US Navy AEGIS Tomahawk cruise missile veteran </TEXT>
