	<TEXT> It's a strange thing, but while I was on honeymoon in NZ (I'm from the UK normally!), I popped into a large bookstore in Wellington and there in front of me was a brand new Matthew Reilly book that I didn't even know was coming! It was the first Jack West novel and I thoroughly enjoyed reading it during the rest of our holiday and on the way home. Funny how things like this stick in your mind nearly 10 years later!

If you could bring any under-recognised novel (or series of novels) to the big screen, which would it be? And no, you can't pick your own!

Best wishes from the UK! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Too many to mention, but here are a couple that perhaps you've not heard of:

Out of the Sun by Robert Goddard read by Derek Jacobi. Excellent book and superb reading.
(In fact, any of his Cadfael readings too!)

39 Steps by John Buchan read by Jack Davenport (nasty officer fellow from Pirates of the Carribean)

Life on Air - written and read by David Attenborough. Honestly, this is head and shoulders above any others that I have. It's truly excellent and informative.

The Belgariad by David Eddings read by Cameron Byerley

Where Eagles Dare by Alistair McLean read by ??? ( sorry, not useful, but I love both the story and presentation)

There you go...a few to be going on with :-) </TEXT>

Think about that: 700km behind the wheel of one of the fastest cars in the world...in a single day.

For those in the Uk, Renaults old F1 car broke Richard Hammond in just a few laps...!

	<TEXT> The normal method is to have a spare set of wheels, so it becomes a simple wheel swap that can be done yourself at home. It doesn't take any more space in the garage either.

Personally, I run steel wheels with winters, so save a little corrosion on the alloys in the winter months. Others I know have bought alloy wheels specifically for the winters, but I'm not that vain ;-) (Also BMW do some really nice looking trims that look excellent on the car)

Recently bought a full set for my wife's Renault Megane - 400 for the set, including steel rims and the absolutely excellent Nokian WR D3 tyres. Highly recommended. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yorkshire here, winter tyres on both cars. 

Why wouldn't you? After all, I just spread the wear over two sets of boots and the winters work better when it's cold even if there's no snow. Obviously when there is snow, you don't get stuck... :-)

Take the long view and it doesn't even cost you any more.

(Note: most of my colleagues run winters now - seems to be becoming more common, at least around here) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Interesting thread. Honestly, I think the solution for a lot of the problems on here is simple:

Get new friends.

I have a circle of friends that I've known for many years. When we eat out, sometimes we split, sometimes we don't. We always just know when it works and when it doesn't and its never been a problem.

Note: I don't drink myself, but others do. We just take this into account with a quick bit of mental arithmetic - I've never felt short changed.

Tipping is easy, of course: We don't live in the US, so aren't completely obsessed with it ;-) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The King's Speech, masterfully delivered by Colin Firth.

Oh, wait. No, the idiotic MPAA gave it an R rating for its language, even though in the UK it was a 12a. Gratified to read that the director refused to re-edit out the profanity for a more commercially acceptable rating.

You have a strange country, my friends... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> While the great man is still with us, read (or better yet, listen to) his excellent memoirs, Life on Air. I can think of no more relaxing way to be entertained than to listen to him tell tales of his youth.

Highly, highly recommended.

	<TEXT> Or, to give a slightly more positive spin, they get to take some very well loved characters and place them into a different universe to allow us, the movie-goers, to experience how life might be for them if things didn't entirely follow Roddenberry's idealistic path.

Its an interesting idea and one I'm happy to watch play out. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Note: my wife saw both new films in the cinema, something that I really struggled with for the latter TNG films.

The hard core purists can hold out all they want, but they won't get it - what they'll get is nothing at all. A franchise cannot live forever without evolution and the recent reboot has, in my opinion, secured Trek for me for a few more years...

Maybe we'll get a new series too :-) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Wat.

I'm not sure that many others agree with you there judging by the steamingly high rating on RT (95%).

You are also aware that their choice of an alternate timeline as a plot device actually allowed them (and in fact required them) to make changes to the universe. No more pandering to Spock trying to come to terms with his human side on Vulcan any more ;-)

Anyway, I thoroughly enjoyed them! </TEXT>
