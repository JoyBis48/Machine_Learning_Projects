	<TEXT> No. He got caught somewhere under my house and we couldn't get to him. We would let him play outside (as long as someone was always with him) and my dad was outside with him, left him out, went to find him and he went under the house. We had no way of getting him out. We died under my house. I was 11 and cried for three days. </TEXT>

If you want to leave the state, by all means leave, you won't be missed. I don't go around bad mouthing where you live so don't do it to where I live. But thanks for stereotyping me with the people who are no doubt the majority. I just wanted to let the original guy who insulted the state and moved away that he wouldn't be missed. That's all. I could care less about what's said or thought about me on here, just that I'm not the typical Texan. By all means bring your down votes. I give no shits about it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Actually, I would say the same top three! I know Detox will definitely get in there. I like Ivy and I do agree, I hate the way they say her name. I liked Coco at first. Then she let Alyssa being there get to her so badly and now all she does is play the victim. Alyssa has gotten over it (except for having little digs at Coco every now and then, which is understandable to me being in the competition setting. People are going to try and put you down.) I would like Coco even better if she didn't have that attitude. Roxxxy is all body and face. No substance in my own opinion. But as far as top three, Detox, Alyssa and Alaska are the best predicted for it. I would want either Detox or Alaska to win though. But, if Alyssa gets that $100,000 maybe she could fix that overbite! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think these top 7 all have something they're talented at. Obviously for Jinx and Alaksa it's comedy, Alyssa is a dancer, and they all display it well. Even though I'm disappointed with what she's done so far, Detox is really talented. She is a great performer in her own right, but I know she can do better than what she's given us on the show. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You really haven't seen much of her work outside of the show, have you? She's brilliant and every bit as talented as Sharon. Yes she and Sharon do the same style of drag and they think a lot alike, but that is a bullshit answer as to why she got onto the show. I don't disagree that Sharon had some doing with it, but nevertheless Alaska is earning her keep. She needs to change it up like Michelle said this past week and that she's getting predictable. They said the same thing about Sharon. Sharon is all about spook, Alaska does more "glam". They're both unconventional. Alaska is doing a great job. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is a picture of the site where JFK was assassinated. They made a movie starting Kevin Cotner exploiting the conspiracy theory of there being a second gunman who delivered the fatal head shot. In the movie, Costner kept replaying the footage in court, narrating JFK's movements in response to the head shot, that he moved "back and to the left." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Dealing with religious friends is tricky. If they love and care for you, the fact you're gay shouldn't be a big deal to them. You're still the same person, you just decided to share an aspect of your personality and life with them you hold value to. If they have issues with it because of their religious beliefs, they should have enough sense to look past it. If they don't, I wouldn't say they really cared for you. But don't take it offensively. They're missing out on amazing opportunity to know someone who is courageous, strong and just brilliant. I've had really religious friends who have beliefs against homosexuality look past it because of the relationship we have and for who I am. Hang in there. I never really believed it when people said it gets better, but now I can say that it gets unbelievably better. I became so much closer to my friends and my life is looking up. I was so low. I have nothing to look forward to but the top of the hill. I hope this helps. Good luck and love yourself. </TEXT>
