	<TEXT> I don't care about men forming clubs. I do care about the actions of a few of their members. I never said anything about other frats. Just one in general. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you! I don't let it bother me. I understand that this isn't a problem and extreme worry for other, and it's okay that they don't understand. You have to be ready for that anytime you make a post! I'm just glad you've understood this and take it seriously. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I never said it was reported. Most rape goes unreported, and honestly being accused makes me more than hesitant around them! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you for being so nice and realizing that I am honestly afraid of this! I talk to my boyfriend about it, and he is super wonderful! I might go to the campus counselor and see if he/she can help!

	<TEXT> Thank you! I don't really get a chance to talk to many peers at the college because I work full time and take classes. It mostly scares me because my apartment is located by all the frat houses, and one of the frats that was recently reinstated that was originally shut down for rape. Apparently, much hasn't changed, sadly. </TEXT>
