	<TEXT> SlimBean has a feature called "The Real Dark Slim" which nightmode-ifies all the system apps on your phone (from messages to the play store). For this to work with gapps like gmail and play store, you have to flash the slimbean gapps (I think). This is because the setting just switches out the apks for the inverted ones when you turn it on and vice versa.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> **ROM Name:** Slim Bean

**ROM Version:** 4.3 Build 1 (09/15)

**Android Version:** 4.3

**Download Link:** [slimroms.net](http://www.slimroms.net/index.php/downloads)

**Kernel:** Slim-4.3-JWR-RC-1.1 (default ROM kernel)

**General Feedback:** I initially tried this ROM because it was one of the few ROMs that had a JWR+JSS hybrid kernel - I was on CM 10.2 nightlies w/ Franco kernel and I kept running into the JSS deadlock issue. I initially intended it to be a temporary thing but after running this ROM for a few days, there is nothing I miss from CM (read: SlimBean has all of CM's features) but I would certainly miss some features of this ROM if I went back, so it looks like I'll be staying for the foreseeable future.

**Hardware Comments:** Nothing really comes to mind... there have been no bumps in the road in terms of hardware issues, which is to be expected from a Nexus device.

**Features:** All of CM's features + way more (and their ROM size is somehow ~100mb smaller than the average CM release!). My favourite have been the way they handle custom navigation buttons/layouts (the UI/options for it are better than CM's implementation IMO, plus you can do things like have custom actions done on long-press of a button, which as far as I'm aware of, isn't available on CM) and transparent navbar and notification bar on the homescreen (which results in a simply beautiful [homescreen](http://i.imgur.com/c49K0Tk.jpg)). There are just so many more options for things, and it doesn't at all seem bloated.

**Stability   Performance:** Both have been absolutely stellar on the stable release. On CM10.2 I was experiencing daily random reboots and keyboard freezes due to bugs in the JSS AOSP build - granted I was running a nightly of CM compared to a stable release, but CM only has nightlies for Android 4.3 ATM and I wanted to be on the latest. It just seems lighter overall.

**Caveats   Warnings:** Honestly, at this stage, absolutely none. I've been gushing about this ROM to all my friends (well, those who know what a custom ROM is) ever since I installed it. I have only been running it for 3 or 4 days though, so there may be some hidden bug that I have yet to discover. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm in the market for an alternative messaging app myself, here's a few that I've found;

[88SMS](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.thinkleft.eightyeightsms.mms) - Pretty much the stock SMS pulled from Jellybean with some enhancements (such as quickmessage popup, night mode and emoji support)

[Textra](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.textra) - Quite nice. I used this for quite a while before switching back to stock.

[Pansi SMS](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pansi.msg) - Has a very similar UI/style to iOS 7 messaging, I suggest you give this one a try if you like the iOS 7 messaging.

[Now SMS](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=crometh.android.nowsms) - Google Now-inspired UI

[Sliding Messaging](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.klinker.android.messaging_donate) - This has the best UI out of all of the messaging apps (IMO). The hangouts UI and animations are just phenomenal. The only reason I'm not using this as my only SMS app is the fact that it freezes quite often. Really unfortunate. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, clinical depression or depression that isn't brought about by a bad situation (where you are chemically imbalanced) can only ever be managed. There isn't really a "cure" or way to "beat" it, you just learn to live with it and manage it in a way that allows you to have a relatively happy life. For some people this means medication and others therapy (oftentimes both). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not entirely correct. A parallel for self harm is (arguably) drug use. Some people do it to look cool/for attention and others do it because they do derive pleasure for it and it is a coping mechanism... I am probably wrong here (I don't have a source for you and I'm on my phone) but I remember reading somewhere that self harm releases endorphins into the body in response to the pain, and people can get addicted to that as well. 

There are also the psychological reasons behind it, such as feeling in control (when the self harmer feels that all other aspects of their life are out of their control, so they self harm because they can control the pain and it makes them feel empowered)

And say what you want about attention seeking, but if someone is so desperate for attention that they feel the only way to get it is to deface their body, don't you think they need some help, regardless of the severity of their self harm? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I love the new UI, but there is one issue that bugs me: with the previous version, when you launched the app it would automatically open up to the last screen/activity you had when you were in the app (for me this would often be all songs in alphabetical order). The new app no longer does this, and instead always opens directly to the "listen now" page.

I only use my phone to play songs in my car, so it is quite annoying with the new app, as it takes 7-8 taps and swipes to get to "all songs" when it previously took one. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Just to be clear, the comment above yours is talking strictly about FB Messages only. You can set Messenger to handle SMS as well, but it does not support group SMS (try adding more than one **phone number** to a message, it gives you an error). It also doesn't support the sending of MMS, so you have to switch back to Go SMS or stock MMS to send pictures. </TEXT>

Nope, sorry

Which implied that what I was saying was wrong. It isn't, stock android does not have this feature.

ninja edit: btw, the feature is system-wide for iOS. It probably has to be hard-coded into the app for the touchwiz implementation. Am I correct in saying that the same feature wouldn't work in 3rd party apps eg. Chrome or Facebook? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In iOS, tapping the notification bar in a scrollable app/view will scroll quickly to the top of it. Eg in safari you read a page and scroll down through a blog post or something, and then you want to quickly get to the top to click on one of the site's navigation buttons, you just tap the top bar. In android you have to scroll up.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks for the comments, I'll definitely fix up the horizon on that photo. I had trouble with the exposure because this is the first time I've taken photos in such harsh light, I really should have shot in RAW but I didn't, they're JPGs so I couldn't get much more of the sky out of them (well, I could get some back on a few of them, like you said). They are mostly unedited except for the first few, so I'll go back over them and try to fix up the things you suggested. Thanks! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No, it doesn't. I really wish it worked like that but it doesn't. Activating the SMS feature simply creates a new chat thread for each contact, so you have two for each one; SMS and Facebook messages. If you want to send them a Facebook message, you have to go to the fb one and its the same for SMS. It does not intelligently switch between the two a la iMessage. Which is such a shame because I would really love it if it did that. </TEXT>
