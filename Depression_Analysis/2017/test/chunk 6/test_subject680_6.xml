	<TEXT> Reading this just made me so angry.  I hate "parents" like that.  I've found the best solution is to say something the very first time the child does something inappropriate.  And I don't say it to the kid, I turn to the parent and firmly say "do you mind controlling your child?  This action/ behavior is not allowed here for safety/insurance/privacy/corporate policy."  If they say shit or let it continue I call a manager over.  When I was a manager, this is what I trained people to say, and if I got called over, I informed them that if said behavior was not corrected, that they could take their business someplace else.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Correct sequence is where the lag comes from.  From the top, the swing should start with the feet, then legs, then hips, then shoulder, then arms, then last being the hands and club.  This is "lag", and is probably the hardest thing in golf to get right. 

Since the golf swing starts with the hands and arms in the backswing, it's hard for us amateurs to not start the downswing with the hands and arms too.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is the most correct answer.  The giant club face helps, but also hurts, same as the long shaft.  Mistakes get compounded and amplified.   It's also part mental.  

You should try taking what feels like half a swing and a slower speed.  Just try to deliver the club face back square to the target. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The bounce matters more than the deg.  My 58 doesn't have any bounce, so I can open it up and use it for flop shots from the fairway.   I use my 54 that has bounce, and I just open the club face for short shots or leave it closed for longer ones.  </TEXT>
