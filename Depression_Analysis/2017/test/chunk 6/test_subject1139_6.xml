	<TEXT> I liked what was done with Leon's character. A tragic outcome for a person consumed by anger and revenge. But I hated the super vanilla end fight. The super perfect golden haired prince who had about the perfect childhood ends up saving the day (rolls eyes). I get there's supposed to be a parallel but it doesn't have to be so black and white that one character gets put on a mountain sized pedestal. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Exactly, there's nothing inherently bad with tropes it's how you use them. Storytelling has been around for a long long time, there's a trope for everything. Saying a story or character is bad because they fit a trope is lazy criticism since any character and story, if you simplify them enough can be distilled to a certain trope.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, people love to blame the studio when things don't go right but I think a lot of the time they're just hired to animate and the production committee that's paying them have the final say on things. This is also the reason why low sales doesn't always mean the studio lost money. They're paid to animate and they're not investing their own money. Low risk work in exchange for not having full creative control.

	<TEXT> Deen also produced, Urusei Yatsura, Angel's Egg, Maison Ikkoku, Patlabor, Ranma , and Patlabor: The Movie. Most of them are considered to be old school classics.

I also wasn't aware that Deen did Maria-sama ga Miteru series. Very pretty anime.

It's very unfortunate that recency bias and the circle jerk mentality lead to lack of appreciation of a studio's older works and contribution to anime. The saddest example of this is Toei. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Wow, not a single mentioned of Mamoru Oshii (Ghost in a Shell, Patlabor OVA, Patlabor 1 2, Angel's Egg) and Isao Takahata (Grave of the Fireflies, Only Yesterday, The Tale of Princess Kaguya). Well at least someone mentioned Takahiro Omori, who's so ridiculously under appreciated.

Out of the big name directors Oshii has the most distinct style. He plays with rhythm a lot, both with editing and visuals. His shot length tend to be longer, which produces a slower, more meticulous and contemplative rhythm than most anime. A style that really fits the content of his movies, which mostly deal with thought provoking themes.

Takahata is the mature side of Ghibli. His characters are more complex and nuanced than Miyazaki's. This is very much evident when the character drama in The Tale of Princess Kaguya is compared to The Wind Rises. Kaguya just offered a more compelling character with a more realized internal struggle. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The extended Emi flashback definitely could've been included in the last episode but even if that was done Kousei's performance wouldn't have fit into one episode. In the manga the performance is a little but more than three chapters long. Emi's flashback was extended to make the cutoff of Kousei's performance less awkward.

The show has been a very faithful adaptation of the manga, so the flashbacks were suppose to be there. The performances would've been emotionally empty without the flashbacks. You can argue about their placement and perhaps the story should've began from the very beginning but altering the story structure so much is something the manga author might not agree with. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ok, this post explains your complaint better.

My point of contention with your initial post is that it's such a simplification that it can be applied to a lot of shows. It's just a dramatic device, how it's used determines if the characters and story turn out well or not.

Ping Pong is multitudes better than this show but uses the same dramatic device. The obvious difference maker being Ping Pong has much better execution and justification for using it. </TEXT>

Polygon most likely had a higher budget in this show than in Knights of Sidonia. It's a 7:00 pm show with Ghibli's name attached to it.

Also Knights of Sidonia had it's "sakuga" moments:

	<TEXT> The last two chapters had me welling up while reading them.

We finally get the whole story why Kousei's mother was so forceful. She was desperate to ensure his future with the only way she knows how, which is through music, and in a short amount of time. Not that it made her actions justifiable but it provided a reasoning and we come to understand her more as a character instead of things being painted as black and white. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> [This scene was great.](http://youtu.be/JDdG1C6ydOk)

The tracking shot follows Kousei and slowly reveals Kaori. As Kaori comes more into view in the frame, Kousei spots her and comically hides from her. It then switches to Kousei's POV, which puts the audience in his shoes and makes it easy to root for the guy. The insert shot of the sandwich (suggesting he wants to give it to her) shows him finally mustering up some courage, then only to be thwarted by Watari.

	<TEXT> I thought Mohawk guy's incompetent communication skills exacerbating the situation was funny. Just watching things progressively get worse as he kept on putting his foot in his mouth was really amusing. Miyamori being the final piece to his domino effect of fuck-ups was a great way to top it off. I can't hate on Mohawk guy, his antics made for some good situational comedy.

I really like that the show presented a reasonable voice to discuss the situation between CG vs traditional animation. The notion that CG and traditional animation can work together and animators from both sides can learn from each other reflects the collaboration between Ghibli and Polygon. I think those two studios working together is a great learning experience for both. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Another amazing episode. This last cour is shaping up to be the best of the series. This anime is unparalleled in terms of intertwining human drama and speculative fiction elements. The only ones that come close are Natsume and Mononoke. 

My only criticism of the series is it relies too much on flashbacks to set up the story and characters. It can feel a bit formulaic at times, but the stories are so good that I barely even mind it.

	<TEXT> I thought it was fine. Her character struggles are finally being established. I believe the show got criticized about it when it glossed over it in the last arc of the first season. It would be kind of silly to begin establishing her struggles and have her progress from it, all in one episode.

Low self-esteem issues aren't exactly easily fixed.

You're also overly simplifying her situation. She's clearly self conscious about her physical appearance and there's a sense of isolation. That probably has a lot to do with why she wants to get stronger and take part in a raid.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Three episodes covered 5 chapters. The first chapter is a long one so it really equates to 6 chapters. This season is scheduled for 24 episodes, so that would be around 50 chapters. At least I'm hoping that would be the pace, instead of 70+ chapters being compressed in 2 cours.

Anyway, I ended up marathoning up to chapter 18. Just couldn't help myself, but that was a good stopping point and satiated my curiosity. The most surprising part was the humor. I hope that translates well to the anime. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The characters feel alive. There's constant facial expressions (eyes, eye brows, mouth) and body language during dialogues. The mouth is animated to match how they speak (like Akira) so there's little flapping mouth effect unlike in most anime. The mouth movements weren't always perfect but I thought they looked good for the most part.

The shadows are dynamic. If you watch the facial animation video again, you'll notice the character's flapping tunic casts a shadow that moves along with it.

For more dynamic movements, I think the videos I posted are representative of the show.

As for negatives, I wish this was fully animated at 24 fps especially since the overall animation is really well done. After years of watching limited animation, I'm used to 12 fps but I hope CG anime would eventually progress to 24 fps. The 24 fps portion of Knights of Sidonia looked really good.

I also wish Ronja's running animation had more variety, she runs a bit too perfectly like a track athlete. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This episode exuded a great sense of adventure and wide eyed wonder. It was hard not to smile seeing Ronja running through the forest while giggling with excitement.

The grey dwarves were effectively creepy just like the harpies.

Also the sound design in this show is amazing. The sound of the wind, the flowing water, the insects and birds really brought the forest to life.

I think people are really missing out here. This might actually have better production value than Fate/stay night and Shingeki no Bahamut. The background work, camera work, sound design, the facial animation, character animation and the overall atmosphere all have been great so far. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Most of the show were done on two's but there were a good amount of well animated sequences, just not as smooth as the clip above.

I thought Space Dandy was inconsistent but it was an experimental show that worked with unique concepts. It was a type of risk taking we rarely see in anime, I think it's worth checking out just for that. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> (although most shows are in the 20fps category nowadays)

Nope. Anime is still mostly done on two's.

This small clip from Space Dandy is what animation done on one's looks like: https://mediacru.sh/RoqPZSo9xRBV

I would say most shows aren't close to looking that smooth in a consistent basis.

	<TEXT> **The motion they used didn't even call for it really**. Unless they used the model elsewhere, they would've been better off making it using traditional animation all the way through.

There's a reason why most camera movements in z-axis are done in CG and that's because it would be more difficult and time consuming with traditional animation while yielding marginally better/worse results. If that part of the scene was done traditionally the animator would have to painstakingly redraw the cobblestones to account for perspective changes. This is time better spent on character animation. Using CG was just the most efficient option while still yielding the desired results. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Nice CG during the Moonlight Sonata solo, well animated and barely noticeable. The characters have nice chemistry right off the bat but I'm really hoping it doesn't turn into a love triangle drama...I need a break from that. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> On another note, the frame rate in Pixar movies (or in anime, actually, **since most anime is also done at 24fps**) likely isn't really an issue because there are certain things animators do (and specifically avoid doing) to make animation smoother at a lower frame rate. The choppiness you see in CGI is likely because the computer is purely mathematical -- it doesn't really think "Hm, this needs corrected slightly," like a good animator will.

No on the bolded part. Yes there's 24 frames in each second but with most anime only 12 out of 24 are unique frames and the rest are repetition. It's animation done on "2's." With cheaper anime it's done on "3's." This is aptly called Limited Animation.

Pixar movies are fully animated, meaning 24 unique frames per second or done on "1's" </TEXT>

You find Pixar movies choppy? Those are animated at 24 fps. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The manga seems to be regarded well. So, I checked out the first chapter and the anime is pretty faithful so far. Although trying to fit 29 chapters into 12 episodes might be problematic. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh wow, that was surprisingly really good. The animation, the art, the direction, the ost, and the voice acting were all on point. Most importantly it was a really fun watch.

This show has that pulp fantasy feel to it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This was like reliving the mess that was Captain Earth. A bunch of jargon and stuff happening with very little in a way of narrative to make sense of them.

I wish the music wasn't so muted because that Yugo Kanno soundtrack is great. Although, the orchestral music sometimes doesn't fit the vibe of the show.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Then how can you stand anime which is mostly animated at 12 fps or less. Hell, sometimes it's not even animated and we just get a bunch of stills, characters just flapping their mouths with zero body movement or characters sliding across the screen. </TEXT>
