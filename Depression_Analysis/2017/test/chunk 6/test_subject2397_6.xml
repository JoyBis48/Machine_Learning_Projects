	<TEXT> Well Robin still seems to hang out with Barney when he's teaching Randy how to live. I doubt Lily ever really hangs out with Barney and Marshal is usually with Lily

I do feel that Ted would be more mad with Robin though, not just shrugging it off </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Easily one of the best episodes, not only because the acting is great but every character is engaged.  Ted wearing Tweed and becoming the sexless inkeeper and Barney's hilarious poem. Then Marshal with the gouda and Jason Segel's great singing video montage (meow). Then Barney and Robin being a "single" couple. "Just the 2 of you?" Lily getting upset with Marshal for springing the video and then getting in trouble for inviting the other couple for a weekend away too soon. And finally Ted'd own poem and Barney's look of regret at the end for being in a relationship " What have I done!" </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not sure what the hate on Stephenson is about. I had lots of fun there. There's tons of people so you will find someone that has similar interests, it's no more than a 10 min walk anywhere, it's got tutoring in the building if you want that, and if you want to party you'll have no trouble finding one </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Freshman year we actually managed to throw a decent party in someone's corner room (bigger than most dorms). All of a sudden an RA came in and there was alcohol everywhere. One dude there decided to go into the bathroom and punch the paper towel dispenser so hard he ended up busting up his hands and the police were called. Then this girl ended up puking on the floor of the corner room and the RA had her escorted to the hospital. It was basically chaos for a bit. I managed to walk out and despite them getting our student IDs down only the person who punched the dispenser got in trouble.  </TEXT>
