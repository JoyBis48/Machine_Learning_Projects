	<TEXT> Wear what you think looks good dude.

Something I suggest is to buy a shoe, and let it sit in the open. Look at it for a while. Try it on, walk around the house with it, etc.

If you start to like it, then keep 'em. Money well spent. If *not*, then return them. It's that simple. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I mean you could go both ways. The gray would match a monochrome outfit. Gray/white shirt, black denim. But so could the blue as a "pop" piece.

That being said, I suggest the grey pair as you can match it with more, but buy/wear what you like. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For example, one of mine is the LeBron 9 "Hornets". Most people look at me weird when I say that, but it's because it was the shoe that kind of introduced me into all of this *and* the first shoe I bought with my own, hard-earned money.

What are some of your guys'? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You could buy a Size 9 in the shoe and maybe add an insole or two in the left shoe to make it fit a bit smaller? Idk, might work, might not. </TEXT>
