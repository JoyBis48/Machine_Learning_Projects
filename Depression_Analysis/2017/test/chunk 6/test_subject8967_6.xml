	<TEXT> I am probably going to buy a few things from the store in the next few days, probably a shirt and few buttons, I was curious about shipping times? I have seen that people on here having been posting that it has taken 4+ weeks and I go back to college in a little over a month and was curious if it was still taking that long so I could know where to ship my order to (my college address or home address) </TEXT>
