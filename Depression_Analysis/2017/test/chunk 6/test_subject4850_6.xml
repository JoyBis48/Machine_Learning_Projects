	<TEXT> So, I started deving for DK1 using the hardware my school had one semester. When I tried to continue the project over the summer without access to the hardware, I found there was nothing like what you mentioned. If this has changed now (which it seems it has as of December 2014) then obviously that's good, but as a product that will just be starting out, it's important to do that from the beginning. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> One of my biggest gripes with Oculus is the lack of an emulator for development. Is this something you guys are looking into? I really like developing for hardware like this, but sometimes the costs and limited quantities make it tough.  </TEXT>
