	<TEXT> reproduce the content

That's arguably questionable, if you take that to mean "copy it to our own servers". Google's webcache [was ruled fair use](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2006/01/google-cache-ruled-fair-use), but I can see arguments that this would be different; the guidelines mentioned in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_v._Google,_Inc.#Fair_use don't all apply.

That said, reading through that page does make one think it would be legal, as the blog post says:

 After all, having an RSS feed in the first place is an implict opt-in to that sort of thing. But trying to dictate terms on top of that while telling me that I automatically agree to them unless I opt out is unacceptable, even if the terms themselves are relatively benign.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The problem isn't with the terms, it's that Apple *assumes you agree if you don't say anything*! I'm sure the blog author agrees Apple can demand anything they want in exchange for listing. But considering someone to have agreed to terms when they're silent is silly, and will never hold up in court.

You're basically agreeing to take responsibility for your own content.

Apple is *assuming* you agree, and in order to disabuse them of this notion you must do an action. That's what's unacceptable. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Apple doesn't have to be responsible, but they have no right to demand the original author defend them. The original author made no guarantee to Apple.

It'd be the same as trying to sue your RSS reader of choice for something from my blog that you read and didn't like.

An RSS reader that runs on device is different, because the developer doesn't store it.

A better analogy would be if Google would index my site without my agreement (with an "opt-out" clause), then sues me because they got a takedown notice.

If the argument is that Apple shouldn't be responsible for the content, that's *their* job to make that argument in court, not mine.

Again, it's fine to put whatever you want in your terms and require people to agree if they want to use your service, but you have no right to demand people agree with your terms in general, and assume they agree unless they opt-out. </TEXT>

They give you a "Letter of Guarantee" signed by their address, so if they ever scam anyone there would be cryptographic proof. So as long as nobody produces a Letter of Guarantee that hasn't been fulfilled, they probably aren't scamming anyone.

(As I understand it, the letter basically says "if btc is sent to addressX by timeY, we will send Z% to addressX2 by timeY2, with limits such and such". So you can see in the blockchain if it's been fulfilled or not.)

This may not be enough for you, just something to think about. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  That's the reason I haven't had to bother to look at the proposals, just as I wouldn't bother to read your interesting exercise on how to square the circle or solve the traveling salesman problem in polynomial time.

The difference is that for squaring the circle, there are mathematical proofs that it's impossible, and for P=NP, most experts believe otherwise, and there's a [whole lot of people claiming proofs](https://www.win.tue.nl/~gwoegi/P-versus-NP.htm). (That page also links to http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~oded/p-vs-np.html which says why he won't check such claimed solutions.)

This "problem" of DoS that you mention has neither rigorous mathematical proof of its impossibility, nor a consensus among academic experts of the same. It's therefore incorrect for you to make the comparison.

Now, as for the actual problems you've brought up:

The government would pay to enlarge the mined block up to its limit. That's what a DoS is. The limit can be "variable" but it can't be infinite, as otherwise mempools will fill up on nodes everywhere in the network.

Nobody's talking about making it infinite (which is impossible to do without computers capable of relaying infinitely large blocks.) THere's been talk of dynamically increasing limits based on averages of past blocks, which would only be able to grow at a fixed rate even if spam was introduced.

Aligning the incentives so that miners profit when spammers engage in spamming has nothing to do with the incentives for people just trying to pay someone using Bitcoin.

That's right; currently, the incentives aren't sufficiently aligned. The miners' incentives are aligned the right way, as in they won't be forced into doing something they don't want. What we need is some kind of incentive for nodes that sufficiently rewards them for their costs. If that was implemented, then spamming would just increase funding for the costs it creates, thus being a wash.

It isn't only a 2-party problem no matter how much you try to simplify it, and not everyone can have their interests aligned to when some of the interests are diametrically opposed.

Can you prove this mathematically? Which people are in a zero-sum situation (which I'm assuming is what you mean by "diametrically opposed")? Anyone wanting Bitcoin to survive automatically has a shared interest with anyone else who also does, so the only possible zero-sum seems to be enemies of Bitcoin versus non-enemies. This part of your argument isn't so clear.

Yes, and so far you have yet to source the pools part.

Now you want to talk about pools? Do I have to find a source that says the effect does not matter to green kiddy pools after that?

The original claim was **only** about pools. There's been no goalposts moved, despite what you seem to be implying.

You don't have to learn physics, just to be able to understand the wikipedia article on the coriolis force enough to know that the size and duration of the system are what matter here. Educating yourself on the strength of the coriolis force does not require more of you than to look it up!

And the size is larger, so your sources are worthless for the question here. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> SPV nodes have no way for example to detect if a node fraudulently reports the receipt of bitcoins to the SPV nodes wallet that dont exist in the fully-verified block chain.

That's actually stupidly easy to check; download all the headers, verify those, and download the block that transaction is supposed to be in.

I think the real problem is the reverse: that they could withhold transactions, and without scanning the whole blockchain you wouldn't know about these missing transactions.

E. A change would be irreversible - Changing the block size limit requires a hard fork and if the larger block size were to be abused, changing it back may not be possible due to changes in who would still be mining without coersion from outside organizations. 

Changing it back would require just 51% of miners and nothing else. It's easier than changing it in the first place, which requires nodes to upgrade. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You seem extremely convinced of your position, despite being unwilling to look at the proposals that would solve the problem. Why is that?

Finding ways to easily filter out spam if someone should choose to pursue DoS is a governance problem, but as soon as you have guys like Gavin deciding which people (or bots) are and are not allowed to get their transaction into the blockchain, you've just added government into Bitcoin.

Miners will individually decide which transactions they allow. If they're fine with a transaction, then it can hardly be called spam, can it? If some government wants to pay for the miners' costs, that just lowers the price for the rest of us.

The important things that need to be done (and are starting to be addressed with technical proposals) are aligning the incentives better, so that the same people who'd be paid by spammers are the ones the cost falls under, for example. Do you think that's impossible, and if so, why?

Ironically the actual banking systems in use in the world are decentralized in execution in a way that Bitcoin is not. I can deposit money in a local bank without having to have the transaction wait a turn in line on a global transaction clearing scheme before the local bank could treat that deposit as an asset.

If your bank trusts you, you could use something like Ripple or Lightning network to deposit bitcoins there instantly. Or if they trust your exchange, they can greenaddress their addresses and deposit instantly also. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  It won't be. If it is it will just be the target of DoS attacks, which is why the initial blocksize limit was instituted in the first place! You do know that Bitcoin wasn't born with a 1MB blocksize limit, right?

There have been proposals. You can go read them.

Yes, I know it didn't start with a 1MB limit. The cost for spamming was also much less when bitcoin was worth less.

Are you being deliberately obtuse now?

No. I was trying to explain my earlier comment on how your argument seemed circular. I get how you responded to that, but I disagreed, as above.

This isn't a difficult concept and it's not something you should pawn off on the Great Developers running their Tons of Simulations. You should strive to understand what is going on yourself instead of just leaving things in the hands of people smarter than you.

The concepts we're talking about now are much more difficult than you give them credit for. I've done a lot of reading, there are dozens of different technical proposals at this point.

If you can't imagine a variable blocksize that isn't vulnerable to Dos, maybe you should read some of those proposals. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What kinds of fees are we talking about?

 But when **transaction** fees go up

I know we're talking about transaction fees, I mean numerically how high.

Yes, if usage increases then fees have to go up. Even Bitcoin isn't immune to supply and demand, and remember that you're the one assuming the 20MB blocks are already filled up. If the number of transactions you can fit in a block is fixed, and more people want to push transactions into the blockchain, the price of each transaction must go up until there is equilibrium between transaction demand and transaction supply again.

If the blocks are completely full, then sort of. But what if the max blocksize is variable, and expands if more transactions show up? (And yes, it's more complicated than that, which is why there are developers running tons of simulations to try and figure out what's best to do.)

Fees go up - less tumblers used - tx volume goes down (since non-bot volume can't increase to match what computers could put on the blockchain).

Why do the fees go up in the first place? And remember, these fees are starting at 1/20th of the current fees, assuming 20MB blocks. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  I'm not saying that no one is paying for the privilege. Criminals pay hefty fees to launder money in fiat, after all. But when transaction fees go up as you have the moon-rocketing masses on their way to Satoshi's Comet, fewer people will use tumblers and transaction volume will then go back down. 

What kinds of fees are we talking about? If usage increases, the fees don't go up over today's implied fees in the subsidy (again, assuming constant price+hashrate), they go down.

What you're describing as inevitable doesn't seem so to me, because there's so many things you're handwaving (fees go up - less tumblrs used - fees go up? Circular?) </TEXT>

But look yourself, pegged against a stable reference point you can see that transaction volume has been flat... for months.

I'm not sure USD value is a good peg, because often a transaction is for much less than the amount actually transferred. If an exchange has a hot wallet around a constant size of btc, then USD value will fluctuate regardless of actual transfer size. </TEXT>

I feel your post is a bit disingenuous. It implies that the cost would be the same regardless of volume, esp. that part about how larger blocks wouldn't fix it. What would be more accurate is that *if* the price stayed the same *and* volume stayed the same, then the cost would remain the same.

I don't think you've thought through the incentives here. A miner upgrading to the new 1MB fork is just like a miner staying on the same software if the fork is backwards compatable. </TEXT>
