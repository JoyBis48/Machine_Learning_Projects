	<TEXT> Thank you :)  
I've since slowed down the asteroids, but I think it might be too slow now. I just have to find the right balance. I've also increased the firing rate ever so slightly, and thank you for the point abouut the bullets being difficult to see. I'm also thinking of implementing the "hyperspace" mechanic from the original, where you can teleport to a random location on the screen.

Edit: I just looked back at the build I uploaded, and I can't see the the bullets either. This is a glitch, and will hopefully be resolved by replacing the dots I was drawing with proper bullet/rocket sprites. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> #Jovian Gasbags
Jovian Gasbags is an asteroids clone I'm working on to expand my portfolio. It's in an early state, but it will be done in the next few days. I just want some feedback on how the game plays. Control speed, player thrust power, fire rate, asteroid size/speed etc.

###Controls

	<TEXT> More posts on this subreddit should include project plans. Thank you for that.

Unfortunately, I'm not solid on javascript, but I wish you luck! The current build is very cool, it reminds me of candy box. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Beautiful :D
I love the visuals you make, and the descrptions of the world that the turtle has created.

I have but one small criticism. You used the wrong "it's" several times throughout the poem. </TEXT>
