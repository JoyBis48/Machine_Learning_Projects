	<TEXT> Nymphomaniac Vol. 1   Nymphomaniac Vol. 2

On Netflix. Has Shia LeBeouf. Watched it with 3 other guys and 2 girls. If it weren't for the fact that we constantly made fun of the overall strangeness, it would have been near impossible to sit through. The ending of Vol. 2 made me question humanity. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, I read OP's story. Thought, 'Well, that wasn't smart dude. Definitely fucked up.' And then read the comments and saw this shitstorm of hate just berating the poor dude. He understands it was not the right choice, why the fuck must everyone start insulting him in every way possible? </TEXT>
