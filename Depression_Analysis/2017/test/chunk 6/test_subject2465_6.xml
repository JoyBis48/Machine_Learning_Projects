	<TEXT>  Snowden did not take any files with him to Russia. As a teacher of Chinese counterintelligence, he knows how to keep his data safe. Neither the Chinese nor the Russians stole his data, nor did they "break the encryption", this entire story is utter nonsense and transparently so to anybody with a modicum of crypto experience.

Thats a nice cover-up to avoid the fact that they really had no tight clamp on the data that they claimed to


So Greenwald says "my files are safe"...and it turns out they're not.

This sounds like a great fiction story...but this doesn't help us RIGHT NOW.

So no, keep that "border-less world" crap to yourself. Its not even relevant...and its insulting you could be that naive to even try to use that as a talking point.  </TEXT>

2 hours ago you didn't even know this information...and now you're asking for more

Oh really? What do you want? ANOTHER leaker? 

Stop moving the goalposts.

This is the closest you'll ever get to this confirmation. Snowden burned everyone living in the west over an ideological hang-up he has about the reality of geopolitics.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Did you know that the 4th amendment constitutional protection against mass surveillance afforded to Americans... is not unique to Americans?

Thats too bad. Because I'm not really concerned how non-Americans think about intelligence. 

All human beings are entitled to this right, and to protection from the law against anyone who might violate it. And yes, they are worrying about it, all those human beings who don't live in the US.


Like hell they are. 

Each country has their own interests. All of these hifalutin poetic ramblings offer no important tangible things to discuss. Practically, this is useless. I want the USA to maintain EVERY edge necessary to stay ahead of the pack in reconnaissance and leverage economically and geopolitically...and even militarily. 

There are borders for a reason and until you understand this, you'll never learn what allegiance means.  </TEXT>

When you inevitably read something like: no evidence from the leaks of anyone being harmed 

DO NOT BELIEVE IT. They would NEVER admit to there being a direct link.

Period.

I don't care if its the right thing to do or how messed up you think it is.

They don't care about you. if you live in the US or Europe these people DO NOT value your "rights" or privacy. They never did.

Domestic spying is one thing...foreign intel leverage is another.

Snowden crossed the line when he did that.
