	<TEXT> Couldn't narrow it down to less than three. 

* *The Devil All the Time* by Donald Ray Pollock - southern, gritty, plain awesome

* *Crapalachia* by Scott Mcclanahan - incredible story telling about growing up in West Virginia. Funny and sentimental. Nothing else is like it

* *The Curfew* by Jesse Ball - dystopian novel with poetry like prose and touches of Kafka and David Lynch </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think the survey might have been skewed a little by giving the 5 most popular choices and a write in. I think people will just rather be lazy and opt to pick from their favorite of the five that they've read (often the only one they've read of the five, in some cases), rather than choose to write something in and throw away their vote, as the likelihood of a write in winning is slim.

I haven't read enough books published in 2014 to deem something "the best", but I liked

* *Silence Once Begun* by Jesse Ball
* *Annihilation* by Jeff Vandermeer
* *Nobody is Ever Missing* by Catherine Lacy
* *Station Eleven* by Emily St. John Mandel
* *The Absolution of Roberto Acestes Laing* by Nicholas Rombes
* *Half a King* by Joe Abercrombie </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm usually very against buying Early Access games, but not sure I can resist buying this next week. Is the EA more or less fully fleshed out? (Missing levels, bosses, etc?) Would I be better off waiting for an official release or buying into the hype now?

Also, any ideas on what pricing will be? </TEXT>

Maybe they thought stuff like *Post Office* was misogynistic by the way Bukowski just casually describes how he rapes a woman on his route like it was no big deal? Or maybe you're right - fucking hypocritical feminist bitches! </TEXT>

I'm no DD expert but you still see a lot of his trademarks here - lots of weird quirky characters, lot of characters going off about philosophy, life, war, etc. It's an interesting novel where he compares football to nuclear war.

	<TEXT> I read 70+ books last year with a 3 and a 1 year old. I'd read a lot more without kids, but finding time is still pretty easy. Bring a book with you to read in the 10 minute breaks in your day - getting there a little early to pick up kids from school, etc. Cut back on TV/video games. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> *Silence Once Begun*, like everything Jesse Ball writes, is excellent. Not my favorite of his, but still one of my favorite books released this year.

*Annihilation* is great, bound to be a weird fiction classic. The other two books of the trilogy were not the same quality in my opinion, but the first is a fine stand alone.

*Station Eleven* was an enjoyable read. Great prose mixed with storylines that feel human make it somewhat unique in the overused post apocalyptic genre.

Did not like *Dept. of Speculation*, despite garnering lots of praise.

	<TEXT> I am the only guy in my book club. I don't mind it. Part of the reason I joined a book club was to read things I wouldn't otherwise read. This has definitely been the case, and while I haven't liked everything, I've read quite a few good books in this way.

Sadly, I think book clubs are looked at as more of a female thing - unless they are specifically SF/Fantasy or geek themed, they are looked at as feminine.

Just shrug your shoulders and enjoy it. They are fun, and one of the few times I get to actually talk about books with others. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Bookstores are a pain in the ass to be honest. 50 percent of the floor space is taken up by e-readers, toys, board games, candles, cafes, etc. If I go in looking for anything remotely obscure, 9 times out of ten they won't have it, and I'm left wondering why I didn't just get the ebook, or get it from inter-library loan. </TEXT>
