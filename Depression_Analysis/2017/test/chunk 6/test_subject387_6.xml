	<TEXT> Go to a doctor and get scheduled for a circumcision, immediately. I had pinhole phimosis when I was 11 and I know exactly what you're going through. That ballooning of the foreskin and the pain you get when urinating because the urine flows back in since it can't all escape due to the small opening. That can cause bladder infection over time if not treated.

I had pinhole phimosis for two years and it was hell. The firs time I urinated after I got my circumcision was the best feeling in the world, I was so surprised and happy. Urine flowed out so fast and easy like it normally should as opposed to how it goes out slow and restricted with pinhole phimosis.

No, there is no other treatment for pinhole phimosis that does not result in removal or partial removal of the foreskin. You can ask but your doctor will tell you the same thing. Even minor surgery to open up the opening of the foreskin wider could end up resulting in you developing pinhole phimosis once again so circumcision is the absolute solution for your problem, for our problem.

I know life is hard but you have so much to look up to. Please stay optimistic, I know it's difficult but please, take care of yourself.

Go to a doctor and get checked up for your pinhole phimosis as soon as possible.

Best of luck. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I got downvoted so fast :(

But yeah, I totally get what you mean! It's ironic that you say Wind-Based Version of Chidori since Lightning and Wind are polar opposites lol. I would imagine the "Rasengan-Variant of Chidori" would be similar to the Supreme Ultimate Rasengan (http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Supreme_Ultimate_Rasengan) as it's practically the Rasengan without the intense shape transformation.

Have an upvote. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Since Kakashi used the same principles of shape transformation and nature/elemental affinity of the Rasengan to create Chidori, which allowed him to infuse his own nature/elemental affinity to it (Raiton/Lightning Release) - which he couldn't do with the Rasengan.

It's also interesting to note that the Rasengan was created with the intention to be able to infuse all the elemental affinities together simultaneously in one jutsu yet we never saw that happen. </TEXT>

fuck 3rd wave feminism. there is a difference between equality and superiority.

I hate how in this day and age, all a woman has to do is yell, "rape," and point the finger and she can fuck up a man's life forever. ESPECIALLY in the many cases where the case of "rape" turns out to be a lie. Some bitch lied about getting rape and nearly got a man in jail for years. </TEXT>
