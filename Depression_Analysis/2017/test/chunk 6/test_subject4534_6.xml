	<TEXT> rdio.com, I'm switching to google play though. If I like an album enough I buy it off iTunes. And if I like the artist enough I actually buy the CD. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A friend actually did this. I thought it was insanely crazy/creepy at the time but he's one of those guys that just says "Fuck it" and does whatever he feels is right. He saw me shopping one day on vacation and decided he had to get to know me so while I was standing around he chatted me up. We became instant friends before I went back home. For some reason he became fascinated with where I came from and made the 16 hour drive to my hometown and stayed a week in a tent behind my parents house and got to know my town and my family. He says its one of the best trips he's made. He's actually the first and only person to ever mention how beautiful my dark brown eyes were. Everyone is quick to compliment blue/green/etc but rarely brown so I was pleasantly surprised. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Do women have different protein requirements than men? I took some whey protein powder from my brother in law until I get my own. But my friend tells me I need to go to a professional to find out what exactly protein I need. He mentioned protein shakes made specifically for women?

	<TEXT> Confidence and hobbies. I think looks (either eyes, body, whatever) can draw a person in but it's personality or choices they make that can make them attractive. The most attractive girl I ever met was cute but what made her so hot was that she was very confident, super friendly, ambitious, and she had various hobbies like cross country skiing. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I feel like my depression comes in waves. I think of it as a cycle in which I go through good periods of productivity and socialization and other times when I think life is completely pointless and why should I even bother getting out of my bed. I kind of get what you mean. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've been thinking about songs like "Wide Open Spaces" and "New Strings" which made me also think of songs like "Long Time Gone" where someone leaves their hometown only to realize how good it was back home. Are there any more songs of leaving home only to miss home and/or coming back? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I hope you told her. I've actually told two of my female crushes how I felt about them. One of them was flattered but straight, and the other was asexual and not interested in starting anything but still remains my friend to this day. I really don't regret telling them. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I keep his toys out so he can play with them whenever he wants so I guess i'll try putting them away so he doesn't get tired of them. Play before mealtime sounds like a good idea. He's not declawed. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It seems that way. I've started to divert his attention by grabbing his lure toy when he starts to become aggressively playful. I just don't want him to think it's okay to try to bite and scratch my arms or legs when he's like this. </TEXT>
