	<TEXT> If this were presented to me back in culinary school, as in, here is some oranges, make a soup I would have done this.

Segmented one orange into perfect skinless segments.  Set aside.

Juice two oranges and strain.  Add orange juice to equal amounts plain yogurt.  To that add a flavor packet of fresh ground coriander, 1 clove, 1/4 tsp fresh ground nutmeg, 1 tsp tahini  and 1/2 tsp finely ground red pepper flakes. 

Place 3 or 5 segmented oranges in a shallow soup bowl.  Pour the orange mixture (cold or heated) over the segments but don't completely cover.

Garnish with a dollop of creme fraiche and some cilantro leaves.  Sprinkle some Kosher salt over the top.


That's what I'd do.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Some sort of gourmet/healthy sub sandwiches with a side like potato salad or mac and cheese.  Prep and assembly provides work but wouldn't be time intensive and if you made you gourmet ingredients from scratch like a siracha or jalapeno mayo(jar) you could easily do this under $400.  

Or enchiladas.

	<TEXT> Hopefully, within the next 40 years, enough for a generation or two to die out, the US will fulfill our founder's hopes and become the Constitutional Republic they envisioned and fought for.  

US Government 101:

The US Constitution is not based on religion.  The US is not a Theocracy.

The US government is not based on direct democracy or the idea of "the majority rules".  Our Constitution specifically spelled out and defended the rights of the minority against the majority if it conflicted with the constitution.  This is evident by the separation of powers within the government that the people elect.

Democracy=theocracy is a non-gratis and makes no sense!  Although I know that many Republicans would love to convince the country that that isn't the case! LOL </TEXT>

Humans tend to gain this sense at a very young age before they can formulate an understanding of morality or ethics.  Empathy is an innate property of what humanity is and some other species are.  It also is the very heart of the "Golden Rule" which most religions will say they are based on even if the end results show that the original meanings where corrupted.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In my opinion I think it is a combination of circumstances. 

 Many high schools do not spend much time teaching evolution if at all.  HS biology classes are usually not taught by a teacher with a degree in biology.  My own HS biology class was taught by an athletic coach.  

 Many people do actively try to sabotage the teaching of evolution.  Here in Texas the Texas Board of Education uses a citizen review board to recommend changes to textbooks.  Most of these people are not experts and some have explicit agendas such as the dumbing down of evolution or including warning stickers indicating that it's only "a theory".  Because Texas is such a big state and textbook publishing is such a big business, changes can effect the industry nationwide.

 The most devastating element to the teaching of evolution and education in general is the mindless cloning of textbook material by large corporate publishers who rely on the endless, thoughtless coping from texts going back decades and not bothering to update new scientific ideas and evidence. Laziness or sloth for profit is still a sin last time I checked!

	<TEXT> Their in-house made pickles are also wonderful.  My favorite is the chorizo-infuzed  Caca Oaxaca burger.  Chef Grober really rose to the occasion when he took on the challenge of creating the best burger in Fort Worth 2013 within shouting distance of Fred's, a Fort Worth all-star whole-in-the-wall burger joint since 1978!  Good things to come! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The best recipe you can use is the stovetop recipe from 'The Best Recipe' book which are collections of kitchen tested recipes from the 'Cook Illustrated' magazine. I've made this recipe many, many times for small and large groups and it always comes out perfect with a silky smooth finish. The secret is using evaporated milk which stabilizes the cheese sauce and you don't have to keep it cold till you need it. Don't forget the can opener though!

If you only have one camp stove and stock pot you'll need to make a slight modification but it shouldn't be a problem. You'll just need a small butane blow torch. The first amounts are for 6 side portions or 4 main dish and the second for 48 side or 32 main.

Mac   Cheese

Topping (opt) 1 1/2/4 cups dry bread crumbs pinch/1 tsp salt 1 1/2 /4 Tbps softened butter

Mac and Cheese

2 / 16 large eggs 1 / 8 (12oz) can evaporated milk 1/4 / 2 tsp hot red pepper sauce 2 tsp / 5Tbps,1/4 tsp salt 1/4 / 2 tsp ground black pepper 1 / 8 tsp dry mustard, dissolved in 1 / 8 tsp water to activate. 8 oz / 4 lb dry elbow or shell pasta 4 Tbps / 2 cups unsalted butter 12 oz / 6 lbs grated cheese, I use 1 part sharp cheddar, 1 part swiss, 1 part fontina and 1 part velveeta

For Mac   Cheese 1. Mix eggs, 1 cup / 8 cups evaporated milk, pepper sauce, 1/2 / 4 tsp salt, pepper and mustard mixture together in a bowl and set aside.

    Bring 2 qts or enough for 4 lbs pasta to a boil in the stock pot. Add remaining salt and pasta. Cook until almost tender but still firm to the bite. Drain, retaining some of the pasta water, and return to pan over low heat, Add butter and toss to melt.

    Pour egg mixture over buttered pasta along with three-quarters of the cheese; stir until thoroughly combined and cheese start to melt. Gradually add remaining milk and cheese, stirring constantly, until mixture is hot and creamy, about 5 minutes. Make sure the utensil you use to stir is long enough to reach the bottom and preferably has a flat end.

    Pour Mac   Cheese into serving containers.

For the topping;

    Mix the bread crumbs with the salt.

    With a gloved hand. Mix the softened butter with the bread crumbs. Sprinkle crumbs over Mac   Cheese.

    Using a butane torch, carefully brown the top.

Love the Mac   Cheese bar idea! Happy Camping! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Cafe du Monde is over-hyped.  Spent seven years driving past the place every morning.  The few times I stopped there, their beignets were half cooked, greasy and overloaded with sugar.  Coffee was just OK.  Tourist trap. 

 Want a good breakfast?  Drive a little farther to Elizabeth's on Chartres at Gallier St.  Looks like a hole in the wall but it's the best and where the locals go!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I originally posted the pics at r/military.  I posted this to r/neckbeards at their urging.

Most of the comments I've read were positive.  The few that were negative mostly took pock-shots at my calling my son out.  Sorry but believe it or not, every parent of a NB or almost a NB should shame their NB.  Being a NB is not something to aspire to!  

Having to ask my adult son to make sure his door to his room was closed when I had company come over didn't make me love him less and he always knew that I was trying to impart a sense of cleanliness when I made him clean his room once every 3 months.  

For all off the NB's out there, you should feel good that he won't suffer your fate LOL!  

I just know that the military will instill that into him and all the negative NB's can kiss my ass!     </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Even when I was religious I'd tell people that God helps those that (try to) help themselves.  That being said, you first need to lose your defeatist inner talk.  Everyone has set-backs in their life.  I doubt everything in yours was bad.  

You obviously know how to use a computer.  My homeless uncle and brother never bothered to learn and it's crippling them plus they are felons.  Are you a felon?  If not then be proud and thankful.  

When you put your kids to bed tonight look straight into each one of their eyes and try to imagine the strong loving person they see.  Then, before you go to bed, look back at yourself in the mirror and realize that you ARE the strong, confident and loving parent that they see and you ARE even if you don't believe it!
