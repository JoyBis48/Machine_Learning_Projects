	<TEXT> Interesting concept.  I used to think they had not been in control of  congress for so long, they didn't know how to govern. When they did control Congress, they did a terrible job on it. I still believe that they don't know how to govern, but how we got there may be different than what I thought.  We do have a problem with the constitution and giving them more representation than they deserve.  I'm not sure we will ever get them out. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A few years ago (when I was 60), I started dieting - I did my own diet of low carb, low calorie.  It was tough.  It took forever for the weight to start to drop.  I started walking - a little more each day - and did leg presses at the gym to get my strength up.  It took a while, but easily got up to 3 miles/day x 6 days/week - 20 minute mile - about 1 hr/day.  I only lost 30 lbs, but my pant size went from a 20 to a 12.  I stopped and it all came back very quickly.  I'm having trouble getting motivated again, but I know it works.  My doctor was really pleased with my vitals. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Join thousands of fast food workers as part of a nation wide strike to demand better pay and better treatment. Low-wage workers are having a hard time making ends meet while corporations such as McDonalds, Wendys, Burger King and KFC are making billions in profits. Theyre paying poverty wages and keeping the entire economy down.

 There will be strikes in the northwest and downtown Las Vegas from 6 to 11 a.m. on Thursday, August 29th. We will be dividing into two shifts, as we understand most people cannot attend the full day. 

 WHAT: 1st shift
 WHERE: PLAN  Las Vegas, 708 S. 6th Street, Las Vegas, NV 89101
 WHEN: 5 AM

 WHAT: 2nd shift
 WHERE: PLAN  Las Vegas, 708 S. 6th Street, Las Vegas, NV 89101
 WHEN: 9 AM

 For more information on the strikes contact:

	<TEXT> Years ago, we had an anti-welfare march in our town with people who think just like you. I was volunteering at our local legal aid office. One of the leaders of this anti-welfare march was there seeking assistance. He had had a heart attack (no insurance), lost his job, then his wife. He was trying to get some help. He regretted his previous stance. The lesson is that we are all one step away from poverty.  I now work at a welfare office.  When jobs were available, we had a lot less clients. People on the whole prefer to work. </TEXT>
