	<TEXT> A new vegas DLC where you travel to the heartlands of the leigon. Inside the totalitarian regime you can either choose to help Caesar suppress a large rebel, or, you can support the cause, bring down the harsh dictator and creating a new series of smaller states. Yet another option would be to fight both sides for your, or the NCR's gain.

I'd really love to see this because the legion is so hyped up in the vanilla game and we see so little of it in the game that it's honestly a bit of a tragedy. Bethesda missed a golden opportunity with the legion, think about it, roads, aqueducts, law enforcement, all of these are things that are mentioned in the base game and never delivered upon. It'd be awesome to see all the public works built by the romans that Caesar surely would've recreated.

Plus, it would give a nice moral lesson and parallel history, the rebels representing barbarians and the legion representing the legion. Because after all...

Rome. Rome never changes. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'd like to see a situation where we'ed get to see the public works built by the leigon. Think about it, if caesar is actually basing himself off of the old caesar's of the roman empire then he would surely adopt one of the practices the romans were most notable for. It'd be nice to be able to go a bit deeper into leigon territory to see things like roads and aqueducts and water purification systems. That's part of why the old empire was so successful. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, If you want to make a new omegle then it's gonna be *pretty damn difficult.* First off, do you know how to even create a webpage? You'd need to have a good understanding of CSS, HTML, probably Ruby, Javascript, maybe PHP. And you'd have to understand how to organize a database effectively. Next, you'd have to get a host. I doubt your internet is strong enough to hold more than 100-500 people in your web server so you'd have to get a pro hosting company to help you there.

Then would come the trouble of hosting the server, making sure it all runs smoothly and efficiently. Server management, making sure you don't explode, etc.

Then you'd have to attract people. If you just want to be able to talk to around 10 people then you might as well just get an IRC going. If you want to attract the kinds of visitors that omegle gets then you'd have to have some form of viral marketing going for you. 

Alright, your server runs fine, the webpage works and looks good, you've got a couple thousand people on and it all looks good. You go to chat with someone and they say "ASL?"

Well great. Now you have to moderate it to get rid of people like that. Good luck having any freetime at all because you're so pre-occupied with making these people behave.

Alright, let's say you put filters in place to auto-block these people. Well, they all leave, after all the people who just ask "ASL" leaves (Which is 90% of omegle) you'll be left with a couple hundred to a thousand people who actually want to talk.

But guess what! they don't want to be on anymore because now 90% of the population is gone and there's no one to talk to.

So good job, you've got maybe 30-50 people on at a time who are actually good to talk to. Talk to them. Eventually you run out of strangers and everyone gets bored.

Now, if you keep paying the server bill then people may, occasionally pass by your site, pop in and see that it's a ghost town and then promptly leave.

Is this what you want? </TEXT>
