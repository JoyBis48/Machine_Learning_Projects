	<TITLE> Opiates for IBS-D </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-03-13 16:07:58 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hello everyone I'm new to this subreddit mainly because I didn't have much to post about. I have IBS-D (most likely, still need to do a little more tests but that's my diagnosis right now) and I get extreme relief from opiates, mainly morphine and codeine. The relief actually feels like a cure, when I take them I have no diarrhea whatsoever (mainly because opiates cause constipation but constipation for me is a relief), I still have chronic nausea and stomach cramps though. The only problem is that I'm not prescribed these meds, but they're easy to come by and make me able to function. If I try to come off them I would probably go to the bathroom around 8 times in 7 hours and I would have to take sleep meds to get any relief from that (if i didn't have any morphine or codeine). 

Anyway, my question is, is it possible to get prescribed these meds for this type of condition?  </TEXT>

It's so fucking stupid, if I hear someone thats black call me a white boy or cracker I'm gonna play the race card because that's also racist. Also, why do black people get so offended when someones mildly racist to them? I don't get offended if someone's racist about white people. 

I'm not being racist if some idiot thinks that I am. If everyone wants equality (which I've always fully supported) then we should ALL get treated the same at the basic level.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I've stopped taking my seroquel because it made me tired all day until it wore off 24 hours later (I took a controlled release version), but not only that but it made me gain 80-84 pounds (not just seroquel but the other anti psychotics I've been on in the past year). I've been off of it for just over a week (I know, not long at all) but my weight is still not back to normal, it's essentially still the same. I've been walking quite a lot (hard exercise is hard for me right now, just got bloods back saying that I've been pretty anemic and I have a stomach condition). I got a pedometer thing and It says I walk around 3-4 miles a day and I've also not been eating much, just lunch and dinner and maybe some chips, that's it. The only days I didn't walk much is when I got sick a few days ago but that was only for 2-3 days. I've not been losing any weight at all, I'm still between 235-238 pounds. Is there ANYTHING I can do? I've came off my anti psychotics because they're starting to just be a waste of time (yeah, yeah, I know, they "helped"), I walk quite a lot and don't eat more than 2,000 calories and at the most I eat around 2,500 calories. I've posted this here before and people didn't think it was possible, but yeah, whatever. I'm starting to lose it here, coming off anti psychs haven't helped (yet) and I walk and eat right and my weight still isn't coming off and my docs don't want to hear it. Is there anything I can do?

PS; If anyone doesn't believe I walk around 3-4 (maybe 5 at the very most) miles a day then I'll take a screenshot next time I'm out walking.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oral ritalin doesn't really do much other than for therapeutic uses. Focalin and Ritalin are only really euphoric when snorted. So try again in 2 days and just snort them. Are they XR or IR? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 20-100 hours and 36-200 hours (for the active metabolite) is the HALF life. So if you take 20mg, after around 36-200 hours (usually it's in between those times) will go down to 10mg in your system. When I was taking lorazepam I was very happy and social for a week later.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm pretty sure it is but not to the extent of heavy recreational use of course. Amphetamines use a lot of dopamine and serotonin and pretty much deplete these receptors (thats pretty much why you come down) and someone who takes them every day for a few years would definitely have some brain chemistry changes. 

I remember being on methylphenidate (ritalin) and I would have to take breaks every weekend just to EAT, so if someone is not eating enough and basically starving themselves due to no appetite could that also damage the brain? Because I know that korsakoffs syndrome is caused by a thiamine deficiency usually seen in alcohol but can happen because of malnutrition too. (Legit question, even if it seems dumb). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Xanax is pretty much the exact same except its stronger.

Edit: Yeah, don't freak yourself out of course but using benzos for a year at any dose (even theraputic) can cause seizures. It's DEFINITELY something to think about and have a friend with you incase it happens, you know, seizures aren't always deadly, seizures kill you usually by banging your head or having an injury when no one is around not by the seizure it's self. Honestly, seizures are the worst physically thing that can possibly happen but it doesn't mean it's set in stone. Just watch out for the mental stuff, you'll be cool though. </TEXT>

You're right. I've been through opiate withdrawal numerous times and it seems nothing like benzo withdrawal. Makes opiate withdrawal a walk in the park and that's saying something.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Since that's what it was prescribed for you could have rebound symptoms of PTSD (not related to withdrawal, but withdrawal will make the anxiety worse for sure since that's part of the withdrawal syndrome). If it gets too bad I would definitely call the hospital, they'll give you a benzo if it's bad enough. Your doctor should NEVER have done this to you, with any psychiatric drug (ESPECIALLY benzos) you need to be tapered slowly off of them. 

Edit: Remember, you wont get every symptom thats listed on the wiki, that's just a list of possible symptoms. If anyone got all those symptoms they'd be effectively dead lol.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's a phenothiazine, basically an old style anti psychotic kinda related to thorazine in a way. There are a few (mainly old I believe) antipsychotics out there with anticholinergic effects. It isn't accepted as an antipsychotic anymore since it's pretty bad at being one but it does have those properties, mainly mildy blocking some serotonin receptors and dopamine receptors.

I remember taking it to get to sleep a few times and I would have audio hallucinations and feel really confused. Thank god it's not used as an anti psychotic anymore.  </TEXT>
