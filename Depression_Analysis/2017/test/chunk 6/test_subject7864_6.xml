	<TEXT> What is your end goal? Recent grad here. I found that the CAS degree was much more flexible (in terms of schedule and content) and honestly, unless you're trying to work at a snobby i-bank, top employers hiring for many business positions really don't care if you went to b-school or not. 

Source: I currently work at a Fortune 50 company with a CAS Econ degree. Hires here came from all sorts of schools and backgrounds, including arts programs, for finance/supply chain/ and marketing roles. </TEXT>
