	<TEXT> This going to be lost in all the responses but you asked if anyone had met someone they saved and I have. I worked an overnight shift and got a call from an older woman who had already taken a bunch of pills but didn't want to be alone when she died through out our call I could tell she was starting to fade but I was able to piece together enough information to find out where she was EMS was able to get there in time and save her. 6 months went by and I got a call from the same woman ( it is by coincidence that she connected with me and not another volunteer) she didn't know it was me either . she told me her story and said that the person she talked to saved her life and she had gone to therapy and was doing much better. It made my year and it made all the rough nights worth it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Since you are about to do the great depression one of the things I do is collect tons of cardboard boxes break the class into "families" and have them build hoses in a hooverville . they also have to wait in the bread line for a fun sized m ms to split with their family. They also apply for jobs to try and get out of hooverville . after we clean up I have them write letters to hoover  about what they think he could do to better their situation . The kids love the simulation and it gives them insight into the frustration of the depression. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My boyfriend isn't vegan but he supports my choice. He eats vegan meals I make and even cooks some of his own. He has started eating less meat since we have been together. He pretty much saves it for holidays or nice restaurants. I appreciate the changes he has made and I have never pushed him to do any of it. Vegans get a bad rap for being pushy and judgmental. I often find the best way to get someone to try going vegan is to lead by example. With all that being said it sounds like your husband has a strong aversion to you being vegan, have you two discussed this? Why does it bother him if you were  vegetation before? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ok so this didn't happen to me but a girl I worked with who happened to be African American , we were working at a restaurant in the historical part of charleston SC. this guy had been on a tour earlier in the day and had heard that many people of african decent still speak geechee. He demanded that his waiter speak to him in geechee she informed him that she didn't speak geechee. He told her "you don't have to be embarrassed I won't think less of you, you're black so I know you speak it". He was asked to leave, but couldn't see what the big deal was "I was just asking her to speak the way she does with her friends and family". </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would advice you to wait until you are in love  for the first time . if you are already dating and you like him what's a few more months to see if you fall in love. Having sex can bring up a lot emotions weather it is your first time or your hundredth . my first boyfriend in high school tried to get me to have sex when we weren't in love but I wanted to wait he  ended up cheating on me with someone who would have sex with him a month later. I was so happy I didn't have sex with him. The next guy I dated I did fall in love with and we had sex and I never regretted it. Just some food for thought as others have said take precautions if you decide to sleep with him. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am a teacher and personally I would find it odd to date a former student mostly because they are so immature. But my mom was a former student at the high school my dad taught at. He never taught her but he knew her as a student they were 5 years a part and started dating a year after she graduated. Granted this was in the 70s but they got married and had 2 kids so it depends on the situation and the people. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My old roommate and I went through student teaching together I was placed at a rough inner city school he was placed at one of the best schools in the state. He had mostly honors classes I had all college prep. When we talked about our days and our lessons he seemed to be doing so much better than I was . he was having discussions about readings he had assigned and having the kids do projects and papers with little assistance from him. I was working my ass off to teach vocabulary and basic ideas. My kids were less motivated they had less support at home they had less resources. I loved my students though they did learn just not at the pace of my roommates students. When we finished I got a job at another tough school and he got a job and a suburban school were he had less honors classes he called me a lot asking for tips and pointers. Having kids who are unmotivated and disrespectful is challenging. Here are the things that work for me . 1 break everything down into 15 min chunks . teach a concept for 15 min then have them practice with it for 15 min then on to a new concept. 2 I find it is helpful to have one activity per class done as partners because it give the kids a structured break they have to finish an assignment but they can also talk. Remember that some kids lack the mental endurance to stay focused for long periods of time. 3 get to know them as people not just students. What do they do outside of school? where do they live ?who are their friends ? Tell them about you too. I tell my kids little stories from my life like how I didn't sleep the night before because my neighbors had a party. Or  that my grandma is sick and it makes me sad. I let them see me as human and because I opened up about little things they started opening up about big things. 4 get involved in extra curricular activities I coach basketball sponsor a club and facilitate an academy it gives me time with them outside the class room which is where building a strong relationship is so much easier. It will get easier just don't give up you will find what works with your kids it may just be different than what worked before.

	<TEXT> We met at a bar and I thought he was nice and funny so I gave him my number. We had a good first date the conversation was good but I wasn't blown away or anything. Our second date I met up with him and some of his friends he was buzzed when I got there and proceeded to get real drunk. He was all over me telling me how hot I was and how cool I was and we hadn't even kissed yet and it really weirded me out. I went home and told my roommate (  a guy) that I was done with him. For some reason he talked me into going on another date with this guy and I did because he made a valid argument that everyone has slipped up and done something silly while drunk. A couple dates later he was so nice funny and smart I realized that our second date was a fluke and he was a good guy. On our 4th date he got an eyelash off my cheek and told me to make a wish then when I went to blow it off his fingers he kissed me and I was surprised at what a good kisser he was . we have been together for over a year and he makes me happy every day.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I work at a title 1 school we hired a first year teacher this year and she is not working out for various reasons. administration is trying to get her to resign so they can hire someone from the December job fair. She is not resigning because leaving mid year looks worse than not being renewed. However talk to your admin and see if they would work with you , our administration was willing to let her resign for "health reasons". She still said no but depending on your administration they might be willing to work out a similar deal with you. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Perhaps I can help with this I used to work at a suicide hotline and I now work as a high school teacher. Honestly the best thing you can do after a suicide for your students in acknowledge that it happened and that you are open to talking about it or letting kids go to guidance if they need to.  Be honest about your feelings but be careful not to glorify suicide. I talk to my students about seeking help for mental illness and let them know I won't judge them if they are having issues. I keep cards with various crisis hotlines on them at the back of my classroom and encourage students to take them. I have had a few students in the past who have reached out to me when they were in crisis and I was thankful that they felt safe enough to do that. I then made sure that they were linked up with resources like counseling or social services. Best of luck so sorry for your loss. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My SO have anal sex every couple months, and here are the things that helped me: 1) you need lots lf foreplay, you need to be really horney in order for it to be enjoyable, 2) if your SO takes a while to cum make sure that he is like 80% there before he penetrates you in the beginning you probably wont want to go for more than a couple minutes, 3) let him finger your bum while you have regular sex, it takes some of the stigma away and helps you to relax. If that is enjoyable then continue on to penetration 4) Use lube and go slow once he gets in just have him stay there for a bit with out trying to pull it back right away. Have him play with your clit or nipples (perhaps bring your vibrator) to keep you aroused because it can be uncomfortable , then when you feel like your mussles have relaxed let him know it is ok for him to make small movement and then go from there. Communication is key and don't be afraid to say I want to stop now or I don't think I like this. You should never do something sexually purely for the other person. Anal isn't for everyone I enjoy it from time to time but it took some practice. Hope this is helpful. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When I was learning to read I basically just sight read everything. I knew what the word looked like to me and that works about 90%of the time , new words are were I get tripped up. Once someone points out what the word is then I can see it (ive heard this happens with people who are color blind too) the type face doesn't eliminate all the elements of dyslexia but it helps bring the word into focus, for me. I wish the best for your daughter let me know if I can answer any questions for you. </TEXT>
