	<TEXT> I have depression, the illness makes me feel empty, I used to enjoy skiing and other activities but I have lost interest in some activities that I used to love doing and everything just feels grey to me. The illness makes me feel alone because not many 21 have depression thats why I hid it with a smile. I don't know if I answered the 3rd q right but it made me open up more about my depression an what i've been feeling inside.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We all wish we were something else. I wish I didn't have depression, but I can't do anything about that prevent it from happening because it already did. My point is, I don't know what you're going through fully but I have two good friends that are gay males and whenever someone saids ''Ugh thats so gay'' I want to slap the person because there is NOTHING wrong with being gay. The internet can be a cruel place for anyone. Unfornately, there isn't much you can do to decrease the negative comments but there is a great quote from 50/50 the movie "You can't change your situation, the only thing you can change is how you deal with it''. There always going to be people that have to bring people down, but you just have to tune them out. As long as you are happy that all it matters. Who really cares what a stranger thinks, because the last time I checked their opinion is irrelevant.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> He needs help, there is nothing wrong with that, but people are afraid of being looked differently or don't think they need help. It's really up to the individual themselves. It took me a few months to finally get help from social worker and the doctor. The move is not easy, trust me but once I did it I feel a lot better and I'm more open about my depression now. Ask him maybe how's he feeling or how are you. I mean this is a tricky question because everyone is different. I would definetly try to push him into talking to a social worker but that's definelty not a easy thing to do. Good luck!   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think about this on a constant basis. Everyone thinks about their funeral, but if you think about this often and when your alone it could be because you're  depressed. Don't worry you are not alone. I think and picture my death right in front my eyes. I picture people's reactions on Facebook and who would show up at my funeral and what would they say. You are definitely not alone. Find something that you can distract yourself the second you have those thoughts. For me, once they appear I try to shrug them off.  </TEXT>

Have something like maybe a bubble bath or something that you don't always do or something special that will get you up and also look forward for the week.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Iron Man 2 was the weakest and most disappointing out of the 3 movies. I would of given Iron man a 60% because Ironman 3 was so much better than the second one. Ironman 3 has a 78% while Ironman 2 has a 73% so there is only a 5% difference between the two films. I would bring Iron man 2 down because it wasn't great. I think Iron Man 3 should be higher up.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So what I loved about Frozen is it was different from the previous movies. There was no prince charming and no princess live happily ever after with a minus bump on the way. It was about two sisters which was nice to see. I think the music made the movie even better because the songs are so well written and so catchy. It's a no brainer that Frozen won 2 oscars for best animated and best song.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So it's going to be three weeks this week I believe that I've been taking cipralex to help with my anxiety and depression. My doctor told me it takes about three weeks for the meds to work. Today my suicidal tendencys/thoughts have increased to the point where I was tempted to put my hands on my neck which I did but I stopped myself then I saw a cord and I visualized the wire wrapped around my neck. I know it sounds really crazy, but is it normal for meds to increase the thoughts because I was told after 3 weeks I would notice a change    </TEXT>
