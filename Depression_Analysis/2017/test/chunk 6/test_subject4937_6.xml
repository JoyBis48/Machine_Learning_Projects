	<TEXT> There is a certain sense I get among the supercomputing elite that Hadoop is technology for Web 2.0 companies, that's there's no relevance. It's an unwillingness to experiment. That seems unfortunate because most of their workloads look a lot more like big data analytics (they would cringe to hear that) than they do strict floating point stuff. SDSC is the only real center where development work on this is actually translating into real applications being run...and guess what, they're running more efficiently. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes, it's a big European event, from what I've been told. I'm only considering because I'll be at ISC the week before (and already overseas). Had planned on working in some other travel but not sure if this is going to worth the time. The technical program is quite solid--lots of involvement from CERN and research agencies there.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Out in Oregon where all the folks are building their massive datacenters (not supercomputers, to be fair--but just as many cores), this is becoming a huge concern. At some point, they're going to have to move to greener pastures (literally)... not sure how this issue isn't at the forefront of people's minds--don't even see anything about it in the disaster recovery space much. Yet meanwhile, look at the situation the whole West Coast was in... not to be dramatic about it, but this is a growing concern. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The top one with the vertical lines is a typical horn coral--looks like you might have some crinoid bits throughout in addition to the shells. Nice finds, though. The one your brother found is pyrite--sparkly but common too. Still a nice start to a budding collection. Try to check out the area around you there in Ohio for trilobites and other semi-common fossil specimens, they're all around if you know where to look.
