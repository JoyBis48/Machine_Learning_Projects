	<TEXT> Finally, it feels that Far Cry 2 is often largely forgotten and overshadowed by it's sequels. However I still feel that FC2 was the more compelling game for me, despite its very obvious flaws and shortcomings. 

Here's a few things I really liked about FC2: 

1. **Weapon Loadouts** were a lot more realistic, you had to really prepare before a mission otherwise chances are that you will most likely die. 

2. **The Buddy System** The idea of having buddies that would help you out in combat and can potentially die was both rewarding and harrowing at the same time, even though these characters aren't fleshed out, you do feel a sense of comradare with them as they are the only characters trying to survive in the harsh African climate alongside yourself, the player. 

3. **The Fire System** It felt like the fire system in FC2 spread a lot more and engulfed everything in it's path. Compare this to FC3 and 4 and it makes them look like tiny shrubs on fire. I'm not exactly sure why Ubisoft went backwards in this regard. 

4. **Weapon Jamming**, ok this one is a double edged sword. It was pretty tense to be in a fire fight and having your gun suddenly jam, however this happened way too often. While there was a system to tell how degraded a gun was by its looks it still jammed too many times, even for guns that looked of good quality. The main issue with this is you pick up poorly maintained guns off enemies who never seem to have their guns jam on them. This was more a case of interesting design idea but flawed execution. 

5. **Time and Day** Finally, the time and day. I really loved doing missions where you had to take out certain people. It would start off with a long drive to the safe house from where you would unload your weapon cases and take what you had carefully prepared, then you take a nap and set the time progression for you to start the mission. It was really nice being able to control the time and day like that and you felt like a proper bad ass doing the set up for these missions.

	<TEXT> Hey guys what graphical improvements/engine improvements would you like to see in Elder Scrolls VI. I'm assuming that ES:VI will use whatever engine that Fallout 4 will use, so I guess this question can be meant for both games. Personally I would just like to see a much less rigid movement system, the movement in Skyrim just felt super rigid, especially when you jump! Obviously graphical improvements will be seen, my dream would be to see nice volumetric clouds like you see in Driveclub, [here's an example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4l39926dJ4), now I understand that it's obviously a racing game so that tech being used in an open world would be very taxing, but I think it would be nice to explore the possibility :D </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Personally the best way to do it, assuming the Broccolis sign off on it, is to get approach it take elements from the best stealth/action games out there at the moment and add their own Bond flare to them. E.g you could borrow the dialogue system from Alpha Protocol, the combat system from Arkham perhaps with an animation set which is more suited to Bond's fighting style. This is assuming Rocksteady are actually the developers behind this game as they seem to do a good job of resurrecting video game franchises that are dead in the water.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Funnily enough I saw the first two films in HFR and the last one in regular 24FPS and I think I would have preferred to see this one in 48 since there's a lot more action happening in the film. I did notice some specific parts where the scene appeared to be jittery, especially during the long panning shots of landscapes. In your comment regarding the actors looking superimposed, I felt that they still looked superimposed in 24, I think this to do with the overly digital look of the film which is just a big step backwards when compared to the LOTR trilogy. Personally though I think Battle of Five Armies serves to be the one that benefits from the 48 fps since there's not much downtime during the film.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would just like to say that I fucking LOVE this film. Such a fantastic film on the drug trade. Daniel Craig kills it as the main character and rightfully so since they got him for Casino Royale after this film. Matthew Vaughn can direct man, he manages to inject a certain flavour into every scene, I can't really describe it but it just feels so well composed you know? I would urge anyone who hasn't seen this film to check it out right now! Here's two of my favourite scenes in the film both with excellent music to boot.

	<TEXT> So I played through ME2/3 on my PS3 back when they came out, however I decided to rebuy ME2 on PC since I wanted the faster load times/higher resolution etc but the DLC for ME2 never seems to go on sale. It's not listed on Origin and it is only sold on the Bioware store which you have to purchase with Bioware points...seriously who thought this would be a good idea? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The majority here would disagree with me but fuck you anyway, I think Star Wars Ep 3 is a fantastic prequel story wise. It sets up the tragic fall of Anakin and essentially sets the tone for Ep 4. The story imo was all wound up very neatly. It would be a perfect film if Lucas wrote the story but not the screenplay.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> OP if you enter the code MAYHEM100 at [Dick Smith's online store page](http://www.dicksmith.com.au/markdown-mayhem-100) you will get $100 off a new PS4. Also unfortunately we don't really have Black Friday sales here, I guess the closest type of sales are Boxing day sales so basically the few days after Christmas where you can get some pretty decent deals. </TEXT>
