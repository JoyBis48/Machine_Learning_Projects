[The Messenger](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0790712/), with Ben Foster and Woody Harrelson, is great. Check it out. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Asylum and then City. Unless you finish up quick and can't wait for Knight, I say don't play Origins. It adds literally nothing. The story isn't half as good as the previous two, and gameplay is not nearly as fluid and is full of infuriating glitches and bugs that devs refused to fix.

People will disagree but honestly it was a really upsetting release for me, seeing as I 100% the first two (which I've never *wanted* to do in a game before). I didn't have 1/50th of the fun playing Origins that I had during Asylum and City. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not my favorite, but definitely the best of recent: Koba from Dawn of the Planet of the Apes. 

The "human work" scene with his scars shows the emotion behind his hatred for humans, and the scene where he [SPOILERS](#s "goes from goofy monkey to killer ape at the weapons cache and throws Ash off the balcony") are two of the most intimidating and villainous actions I've seen in a while. </TEXT>

That's the first Google result for "David Fincher Alien 3 Problems". I didn't bother reading it but I'm guessing it covers it. Basically Fincher had little to no control over the film and was constantly arguing back and forth with the studio. He has publicly criticized the final result in the past. </TEXT>

Since then I took a break for a few weeks and am now back to experiencing tingles just as powerfully as I used to.  </TEXT>
