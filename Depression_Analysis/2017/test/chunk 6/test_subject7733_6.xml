I'm talking about any concert where there is standing room in the front and people just try to crowd to the front. The amount of dehydration that occurs in conjunction with any drugs/alcohol can make people faint and get trampled on. I'm sure this seems pretty harmful, but you'd be surprised. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> ELI5:How can electric companies over charge and estimate your power consumption without actually looking at what you consumed? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-03-10 17:07:39 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> My roommates and I usually run an electric bill of about $120. That's a lot for us, but ya'know being in college up all hours of the night + computers + appliances, it's not hard to believe we spend that much. However, this month, the electric company charged us $240, which truly surprised all of us. So basically, my roommate called up the power company, and after some circular logic and avoiding an answer. Our bill turned out to be a more reasonable $130. How can they over charge $110 without even caring? Should be a law or something in place?


EDIT: is it the style of the meter that's outdated or just the meter? Because our apartment complex is brand new. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> /r/pinkfloyd's favorite literature? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-02-26 16:06:07 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> After the discussion about Amused To Death the other day on here. It got me thinking about what the general fans in /r/pinkfloyd like to read. Because Amused To Death is a nod to [Neil Postman's Book](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amusing_Ourselves_to_Death) "Amusing Ourselves To Death" which talks about the books "1984" and "A Brave New World" and his conjecture about which is happening to society. Also Pink Floyd's Animals album is largely influenced by [Animal Farm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_Farm) by George Orwell. So there are two distinct albums that are directly influenced by literature. So I'm assuming that since PF is intertwined with literature, so must their fan base. What are some of your guy's favorite books? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> * Pink Floyd - Wish You Were Here

* Pink Floyd - Animals

* Radiohead - Kid A

* Eyedea   Abilities - By The Throat

* Red Hot Chili Peppers - Californication 

Sorry to nominate 2 pink Floyd albums but I couldn't pick one and I felt both are worth at least a nomination since this isn't the actual poll. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I can see that, I'm one of the people that thought it was stoner wanna-be's that listened to them. Then I gave them a real look and realized that pink Floyd is beyond all that and I don't associate my fandom with drugs at all </TEXT>
