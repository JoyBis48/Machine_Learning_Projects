Thank you for your input, and I understand where you're coming from. :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's definitely about how you look at it.
I understand that it's hard, and you get yelled at, which is fine. It toughens you up. I've wanted to join since I was a small child, it is about pride to me and about the benefits of college, friendship, and strengthening myself. My uncles have gone through it all, and one of my only friends has been enlisted for little over a year in the Marines. Whilst another is currently in BT for the Army.

Yeah you can get lonely, homesick, and all that. But that's life, and that's what I choose.

Thank you, and the guy you commented to, for both of your inputs. I greatly appreciate it! </TEXT>
