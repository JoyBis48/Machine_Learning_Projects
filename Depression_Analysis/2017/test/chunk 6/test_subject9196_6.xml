It is Polish minister of defence - Tomasz Siemoniak

And on the right Polish president - Bronisaw Komorowski.

Reaction is to statement that new NATO force HQ is going to be located in Poland - however later on he said that was because of wrong translation - and he have hear "forces will be located where they will be needed".   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes, it is good, same as Rapid - just full size layout.

In that price tag you wouldn't find anything better.
You can also look up rosewill rk 9000, which is also considerate as one with good quality/price ratio.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You didn't specify layout, as I'm a TKL guy...

CoolMaster Quickfire Rapid - good, "standard", cheap (one of cheapest), and same manufacture as Filco.

Other than that - Leopold 660M, to Europe is one of cheapest options if you like such layout. So which keyboard is "the cheapest" depends on that where you live.

For example in Poland SteelSeries is one of cheapest (90$), and next is Razer BW Tournament (120$). In Europe you should also check Das Keyboard as it might be good option to go. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, I'm fully aware that system of ratings is "dumb" and Google could easily make it better, but still it doesn't justify such garbarage reviews.

What's more I also get review such "Hello" (1-star), and "You won't look at it if I gave 5 stars. Great app!" (1-star).

Which was pretty sad for me as I also read 5 star ones. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> 12Hours version 2.0 - I worked hard for you guys! </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-05-19 20:39:10 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Maybe some of you remember [my widget \(12Hours\)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tajchert.hours) that I posted [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/1uvt84/made_a_clockwidget_with_events_marked_as_colored/) 4 months ago.

After a long time I have done bigger update that add thinks such:

* Languages (Polish, German, Portuguese, Chinese, Italian, Spanish, French).
*  **More than one instance of a widget** - go and put 12Hours everywhere!
*  Second custom touch action for a widget.
*  **Custom colors!**
*  New skins (and more yet to come).
*  Wizard when adding a widget
* Optimization and code cleaning so next features will take less time.

I know that there is still much to do, but would love (as last time) feedback and advice on what features I should focus on, and what you would like to change.

That is my "thank you" for you guys, as only because of you it became popular (around 130k downloads).

disclaimer I would take a look at each (even down voted ones) ideas and opinions but things will be implemented not earlier then 2-3 weeks, because I discovered (by making that widget) that it isn't good to write code in a rush./disclaimer

EDIT: I have made some **G+ group** with access to beta releases and to discuss new functionality, submit your layout to include into app etc. -[HERE](https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/108716578003125422667) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would suggest as most people here - go for it, as it is best moment to do so at your life (and later on it would be only worst).
But don't rely on nursing job in Poland - English teacher would be a better choice, and if possible try to merge those two - look at Medicover/Lux Med (private clinics) as they possibly are looking for such people (or maybe translating medical literature to Polish, or teaching medical students).

Good luck! </TEXT>
