	<TEXT> I'm moving to Providence in the coming month with my fianc.  I'm 31 and with no children.  I've been told I would like downtown or east side Providence (not East Providence).  I know nothing about the area.  Any suggestions on neighborhoods, apartments or surrounding areas to live or avoid would be great.  -thanks  </TEXT>
