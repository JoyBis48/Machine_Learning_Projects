	<TEXT> I probably wont though right:/ what are we like 12 million square miles of area? I'm happy with just seeing a new place at least once a year.

Favorite place I've visited so far was Puerto Rico. I really want to visit the Pacific Northwest and Spain. So, where have you guys gone/where do you want to go?

Is anyone not really into it? I have a couple friends who think that their hometown is perfectly large enough to be explored during their whole lifetime. I dont really understand this type of thinking tho. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Flash Boys by Michael Lewis, about a recent wall street trend.


Devil in the white city by Erik Larson, amazing book about the 1893 Chicago world fair, its construction and the serial killer living in the city at the same time. I just finished it a week ago and I find myself thinking about the time in which the story takes place a whole lot.


The Looming Tower by Lawrence Wright, not too heavy on narrative, sometimes it feels like an info dump, but a very well written and extremely well researched book on Al qaeda and the cia/fbi on the road to 9/11.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've read three of his novels and enjoyed them all, but Michael Chabons "Adventures of Kavalier and Clay" seems very intimidating to me. Its about 600 pages and it won a Pulitzer.

	<TEXT> Most important book series ever. Strong in popularity when for the first time ever books had to compete with the internet and video games. An entire generation of readers would have been lost if it weren't for harry potter.


Harry Potter 1, made me want to read Harry Potter 2, that led to 3, and eventually until 7. When I finished the series I said, what now? Now, all the other books. Any book. I just need more stories. Thank you Rowling! </TEXT>

Is there any good novel in which a vacation goes horribly wrong? Murder, disaster, tragedy anything.
