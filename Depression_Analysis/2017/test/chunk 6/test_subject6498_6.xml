	<TEXT> Hi! I wonder if anyone out there has any experiences in old radios and how to get them working again?

It's an old swedish model, I found information about it on this site: http://www.radiomuseum.org/r/luxor_r192b.html

I found it at my grandfather's summer house and wonder if there are any way of getting it to work?

As of now I believe the only thing missing are the two batteries.

So, I wanted to make a version of Serenity in KSP with as few mods as possible. And after two hours of building and refining this is the first version that I was able to land with, without experiencing a rapid unscheduled disassembly.

I wanted to share it and I hope it inspire someone to make a better version. I'm a rookie when it comes to replicas and building stuff for fun in KSP and I know there are really talented engineers out there.

I'd say he lines up good with the swedish Center and the Environmental Party. The American right wing is so far right we can't even see it on the political spectrum in Sweden.

	<TEXT> I'm not american, that may be relevant to know. But Sweden had a 2 hour long debate tonight with all 8 party leaders. I think it shows a lot when some politicians try to answer the questions with a straight face and some will always try to steer the discussion in another direction.

And the dialogue wasn't spot on. Try to make it sound more like speech. People doesn't speak with perfect grammar. Especially not when there's a dragon nearby.

I wanna read the next part though! </TEXT>
