	<TEXT> as i said if a kid is being unreasonably loud and they can't control it they should leave it's as simple as that.. that's the respectful thing to do they can easily feed the kid at home if they cannot control it in public

other people shouldn't have dining experiences ruined because some little brat won't keep quite

it's not that people hate kids it's that people are sick of parents that allow kids to continue being loud or often run around the restaurant or whatever..

	<TEXT> what the woman did might of been a little harsh but lets admit it we've all thought about doing it when a parent just lets the kid squeal and scream in a public place because they are too stupid or lazy to control them

when i was a kid if i did what this woman's kids did i would of been in trouble because my parents knew how to control us and respected the people around us.

really sick of the parents that just allow kids to run around screaming in public and make excuses like they are finding their voice or we where all kids once.. those excuses just mean they are bad parents that can't control their kids

	<TEXT> no one is getting fired they are taking a paycut on the already high wages they earn (some are on 150k or more)

besides the ceo taking a paycut to keep paying workers the same amount of money is not going to fix anything they would still be losing money as costs would be the same

just because a CEO has money in the bank doesn't mean they have to run the company at a loss that would just lead to workers getting fired in the long run when they lose more and more money </TEXT>

	<TEXT> it's declining and has been for a while it's the whole reason why there was that meeting to discuss changes and why so many past and present drivers are suggesting ideas to make it interesting again.

sure there are fans that love it how it is but without new fans coming in the sport can't survive.

the biggest complaint i see from people who are not diehard fans is that it's boring and predictable, it's not helped that it went from 4 years of vettel domination (even with those 2 close years) to the current 2 years of utter complete Mercedes domination.

then you have broadcasting which in many areas is no longer on free to air tv and attending races costs an arm and a leg and probably a liver as well </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Queensland Liberal and panel member Steve Ciobo was unapologetic, saying he believed the only reason Mr Mallah was acquitted of terrorism was that the terrorist offences "weren't retrospective in application", and that he would be glad to see Mr Mallah sent out of the country.

so would i he was jailed for threatening to kill asio and other government staff and traveled to Syria during the Arab spring

he clearly supports ISIS and has no place in civilised society

if he's left unchecked he could easily become the next man monis
