	<TEXT> We meet on myspace back in  in the beginning of 2008. And I saw her profile pic and said damn she's hot. It was like an artsy black and white pic of her in a bra and jeans. I was talking to my cousin about adding her and that next day got her number and started texting and met up and that's about it. We've been married for 1 year now but have been on and off prior to the wedding in 2013. Still love her and thinks she is as beautiful as the day I saw her. She told me that I looked ugly and different from my profile pic. I assure you my pic did look like me. She is weird.  </TEXT>
