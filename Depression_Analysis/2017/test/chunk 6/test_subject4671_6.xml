	<TEXT> I would start out playing against bots. you learn mechanics of the game and how champions/items effect the game. buy one champion of each type using the IP you are earning or even play the free champs. 

Save most your IP. Just save it all now. Then buy 3 rune pages at level 20:

1.)AP RUNE PAGE
2.)AD RUNE PAGE
3.) TOP/SUPPORT Rune Page

then use whatever is left over to buy champions that you have tried out during their free championship week and enjoy. Make sure you buy/learn at least 1 jungler and 1 support REALLY well because thats what you will end up playing a lot as you start playing normals. :D

Itemization can be learned via reading guides/watching streams/figuring out for yourself </TEXT>

I'd said i've won all but 2 of my games against zerg since i went mech. The two i lost were based on me not protecting against counter attacks enough. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> here are my thoughts as i watch the replay.

* no bunker at 5 minute mark...a rallied zealot and stalker could kill you straight up right now
* The protoss takes both your gas and they come late...consider throwing down a 4th rax here and then taking 3 gas puma style.
* bunker ESPECIALLY true since you are taking a fast 3rd
* scan when your second orbital finishes to make sure he has expanded...if not you need more b unkers ASAP. also good to know his tech path so you can change your comp.
* couple of supply blocks...but decent micro 46 scv's at 10 minute mark...ideal amount is 50. work on that.
* you really can't afford 3 starports
* at the 15:00 minute mark you are maxed....with 1/0 against his 1/1. and up 80 supply.
* please for the love of god at least hot key your entire army on 1 button
* the first battle happens at 18 minutes bc your opponent attacked into you with 160 supply...40 supply more than when you first maxed.
* I know artosis says when ahead get more ahead...but in the words of Day[9], "sometimes you just go f*cking kill him"
* the fight is done...you are still 30 supply up....instead of regrouping you chase him with a small section of your army...
* you still win this fight are now double his supply! woohoo!
* you do have 80 scv's....a couple too many. next time you get maxed start taking the map and choose a couple scv's and use them in your army for buffer.
* 90!!!! scvs. WAY WAY TOO MANY...a good rule of thumb is that as you take your 4th base you probably don't need to make more scv's unless a lot get killed. This might be the fact the lost you this game...over producing workers.
* 21 minutes and you are on 2/1....try to make that 3/3.
* one emp on the templar = game over.
* marauders have more sustain than marines...they can eat a couple of storms and live...need to sprinkle them into your comp late game.

	<TEXT> you overlooked the fact that the protoss was able to have four colossi AND templars with storm. Basically, what i'm saying is your attack came too late. Also, you successfully killed the third so at this point you are ahead. There is nothing wrong with pulling back, getting to 3/3, taking some more bases and continually denying that 3rd and bleeding him dry.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I figure it wouldn't hurt to ask. Especially interested if you have experiences with WestSide For Skinny Bastards and/or SS. I've got some experience with the BeachBody workouts(completed p90x, did a month of Insanity and 2 months of Body Beast) so i can do accountability on that too </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I wouldn't...zerg players need to stop doing the same opening...they can't expect to beat the warhound doing their old builds from heart of the swarm...they need to experiment more.....maybe they should build more BroodLords?

	<TEXT> the first time you put real aggression on was the 20ish minute mark...you did a double drop yes but it was relatively ineffective.

 You had an early +1 but you don't use it....you can probably delay it to get faster medivacs and/or more units. Having those extra units earlier is really important imo. i would scan the natural to see his army comp and whether i can attack it while simultaneously checking the third...If the third is there i attack...if its not I pull back as he should have colossi coming VERY soon. the drop was relatively ineffective...

really imo its all about delay/punishing the third of a protoss </TEXT>
