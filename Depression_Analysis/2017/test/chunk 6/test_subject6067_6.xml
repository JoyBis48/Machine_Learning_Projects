	<TEXT> Hi guys!  I'm looking to purchase one of those tv programming boxes for my parents so they could watch more chinese shows.  I've looked at Suntv, TvPad 2 and 3, and wasn't sure which ones you guys would recommend.  I don't live with them but they do have cable internet so I figured one of these boxes would be great.  Any input would be appreciated :D   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It seems like Howard always gets bummed out about Artie since the show was sort of blamed for his suicide attempt.  I agree that the crowd would have loved it.  I just think that Artie showing up or making a video would end up being more about Artie and overshadow the other stuff that ended up happening.   </TEXT>
