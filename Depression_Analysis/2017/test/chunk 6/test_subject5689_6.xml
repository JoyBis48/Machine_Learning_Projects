	<TEXT> This is in Ouray, Colorado at their annual 4th of July water fight. Two person teams battle each other with fire hoses until only one remains. The crowd is always right next to the action, so things like this happen from time to time. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This reminds me of what happened in my high school. I was in band, and it was generally known amongst the band kids that one of the female students was living with the male band teacher and his wife. She didn't have the best home life, so we all wrote it off as a creepy form of charity. We found out later that our band teacher got fired, and when we also found out he was getting a divorce it didn't take long to figure out what happened. After his divorce, he moved to a different town and married the girl who was living with him. 

We had high hopes for our next band director. He seemed so nice. My senior year was his first year, and we didn't have any problems with him. Seven years later, he ends up in jail for underage p in the v. I ran into him at a chocolate shop last year when I was with my parents, and I didn't recognize him. My dad did though, and he could tell that the creep remembered me and was intentionally avoiding me. Never did find out all the details on that one, though.

	<TEXT> There are a lot of nice people here as well. Get out of the cities, go up to the mountains, and find somewhere you can't see anyone else. Let the mountains heal you. </TEXT>
