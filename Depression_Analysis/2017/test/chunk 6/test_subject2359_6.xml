I didn't say he *caught* it, I said he was poisoned.  The fact that he's not an alchemist would make it that much easier.

And the Medica would recognize denner resin poison, the sickness from which wouldn't last day after day.  From Wil and Sim's description of alchemy, the Medica can't really do much about the nastier or more subtle stuff. </TEXT>

Young's Market is nice, especially since they slice their bacon thick, but expect to pay a lot for gas at the two whole gas stations available (gas prices in both Westwood and Chester tend to be about 50 cents more than the California average).  Buffalo Chips makes decent pizza, and there's a couple of other good places to eat (the Old Mill Cafe being the standout), but precisely dick for entertainment.  There's no in-town bank, just an ATM.  Also, the library sucks, even for a small town.

The U.S. negotiated and signed disarmament treaties with the Soviet Union, a nation that was literally arming other countries fighting and killing American soldiers, a nation that had tens of thousands of nuclear warheads aimed at us.

But the modern Republican betwetting, pants-shitting, sociopathing neocons are blind to history.  They only know that the scary Kenyan Muslim darkie who stole the White House thanks to ACORN is bowing down to Tehran and gifting the Ayatollah with the nukes he'll use to destroy the 51st American state of Israel by ... negotiating to delay Iran's nuclear weapons program.  Or something.  It apparently doesn't have to make sense, outraging Republicans is now as simple as not killing funny-talking brown people. </TEXT>

As well, the U.S. had 9 SSBNs in service, with the rather capable Polaris 1A SLBM (range of 1000 miles), while the Soviets had a haphazard scattering of converted subs with short ranged missiles that had to be launched from the surface.  That, and all the IRBMs that the U.S. had stationed in NATO countries very close to the Soviet border, whereas the Soviets just had whatever they'd installed in Cuba.  

The only nukes likely to get through to the U.S. would've been the ones launched from Cuba, and those probably only would've been used if they were in the process of being bombed. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I can actually see how some of them might not be - Hemme, Brandeur, Lorren, Herma, and to a lesser extent Arwyl wouldn't need to be full arcanists to run their departments.  

They could've attended the University when they were younger, learning certain basic principles, then went out into the world and attained great stature and fame in their respective fields, then be brought back by the University to be Masters teaching in those fields.  Naming, Artificing, Sympathy, and Chemistyr/Alchemy would of course require a full arcanist's level of talent and knowledge.  

But Archiving, Rhetoric   Logic, Mathematics, Linguistics, and perhaps Medicine ... these are things where the rest of the Four Corners might offer just as much opportunity for learning and accomplishment as the University.  Someone like Chronicler could potentially be brought back as Master Archivist after another twenty years of gaining repute, for example. </TEXT>

If there's one thing Republicans and Democrats, liberals and conservatives, Red States and Blue States, pro-Choice and pro-Life, hawks, neocons, peacenicks, dirty fucking hippies and chickenhawk warmongers can come together, join hands, sing Kumabya,  and agree on, it's that the Kings got seriously fucked in Game Six.

	<TEXT>  Bast's understanding (perception?) of Ctaeh is clearly based on legends and stories

Which is probably very, very deliberate on someone's part.  I wouldn't be surprised if Fae children are raised with these stories to keep them from seeking out the Cthaeh.  It probably really can see almost everything, which makes it dangerous to talk to - so, you'd want to discourage that, by really amping up what it's capable of.  The Sithe probably know that the Cthaeh doesn't actually know the future, but the fact that it knows everything in the present is bad enough.
