	<TEXT> My dad was in the living room. I walked right past him and then slipped quietly out the door. Three hours later, at about 4:30am, I walked back into the house and passed my dad again. He looked at me and said, "Hey, you going to bed now?". 
It was then that I learned that my parents really don't give a shit. </TEXT>
