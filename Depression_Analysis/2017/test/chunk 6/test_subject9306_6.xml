	<TEXT> While it's really nice to have some people saying we look attractive for once, I can't help but notice that all of the attributes described are of men that are basically models. That's fine - models are attractive for a reason - but I think it's interesting that females are born with their most attractive sexual features (breasts, hips, etc) and improve upon these by building various muscle groups/maintaining a certain level of body fat, but men are largely born without the muscles and more importantly the substantial self-confidence that is critical to the perception of an attractive male. These things need to be worked for. I wonder if that has contributed to the current dating system of men approaching women, who then appraise their value and accept them - being undeniably in control as the gatekeepers of sexual intercourse in our society - rather than the other way around.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> While that's all very true, I personally would categorise makeup and clothing as (albeit very important) external modifications which are to some extent masks, whereas exercise and building muscle is changing your actual body. 

This is important because a man with a sexually attractive body is attractive all the time, and knows he is - whereas women who feel that they are only attractive with makeup (despite the fact that they're probably fine without it) can become very dependent on it for their self esteem and feel uncomfortable or exposed without it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think it's interesting that women are largely born with their looks, and other than staying skinny, can't do that much to change them. Men, however, can all physically (aside from their face) be attractive or hideous based on muscle mass, body fat etc.

Furthermore, as girls are born with their looks, if they've been skinny all their lives they haven't really worked for it at all. They are just innately attractive, and I think that must affect their self-esteem and -perception quite a bit. Men, however, must work hard to be attractive. This also extensively applies to their attitudes and their confidence - women's personalities usually come as at least passable with no effort at all. </TEXT>
