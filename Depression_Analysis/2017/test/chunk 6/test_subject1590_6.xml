	<TEXT> Not sure if tradition is 90% better... I almost always open with Liberty, because I know I will end up with like 8-10 cities after battling some opponents. I think Liberty is worth it as a long term investment, if you plan to fight (which almost everyone has to playing higher levels).

But you are probably right, tradition is better for beginners.

Honor is also important, should at least unlock it to get culture points for killing barbarians. This is almost always my 1st or 2nd unlock. </TEXT>

3) I worked at the Alumni Relations office at Rotman when I was in my 3rd year. It was great, fun and you get to know a lot of alums who do interesting things.

	<DATE> 2015-06-24 15:00:39 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> 1.   Your team is everything.
2.   Solve a problem you are passionate about.
3.   Never outsource your core competency.
4.   Be cheap lean but dont be afraid to spend.
5.   Chase the vision, not the money.
6.   Never eat lunch alone. Always be closing.
7.   Ideas are worth sh*t. Execution is key.
8.   Dont take momentum for granted.
9.   Learn to monetize from the get-go. [cue Notorious BIG - Get Money]
10. Set S.M.A.R.T. goals.
11. Focus. Its easy to get carried away with multiple projects.
12. Stay uncomfortable.
13. Be metrics driven. You cant improve what you cant measure.
14. Not everything your customers want is what they need. Learn to read between the lines to really get at the problem.
15. Consistently seek out constructive feedback.
16. Know your competitive advantage and stay obsessed over your competitors and the industry.
17. Be a thought leader in the space.
18. Move quickly.
19. Talk is cheap. Deliver instead.
20. Focus on customer service. Word of mouth is the easiest form of marketing.
21. Make something that you know people want.
22. Place a premium on aptitude versus experience.
23. Learn to say no (respectfully).
24. Trust your gut.
25. If things aren't working, ask yourself why and change that. ( This sounds simple. Eh ? Still most of the people don't do )
26. Hire people smarter than you. ;)
27. As a founder, you set the tone for others. Dont forget that.
28. Don't be afraid to ask for help!
29. Make deliberate decisions.
30. Dont lose sight of close friends and family. You dont need to be a hermit just because you work a lot.
31. Dont micro-manage.
32. Start with why? 
33. Bring out the greatness in those around you.
34. It's better to own a smaller piece of a bigger pie than a bigger piece of a smaller pie.
35. Be humble.
36. Utilize your calendar and tasks to the max.
37. Tackle your most daunting tasks in the morning. Save the easier stuff for later. ( this simple habit has helped me a lot )
38. Read often. ( Plenty of online and offline quality content are available. I would recommend a book : $100 start up )
39. Workout at least 4 times a week. Body and mind are one. Oh yeah, and get your sleep too. ( Yoga, Cardio and Light body weight exercises are sufficient. You don't need to spend on a gym )
40. Be authentic and transparent. ( May not give the result immediately. It helps in long run )
41. You will hit hurdles, push through and get ready for the next. Stay optimistic.
42. Ask questions. 
43. Nobody should have a personal office. Open floor plans allow best for collaboration.
44. You have 2 ears and 1 mouth. You should listen more than you talk.
45. Culture is crucial. Your employees should want to stay late and hangout.
46. Sell value, not products. 
47. Always have an attorney glance over any legal documents. Speaking of, document everything so there is a record for all parties.
48. There is no such thing a 'part-time entrepreneur.' :)
49. Learn to move on if youve exhausted all efforts. Be honest with yourself.
50. Have fun!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's exactly what I am asking here.

It is possible to fill in the missing values with averages, it's also possible to even throw all entries with missing values out (due to the nature of the problem - we are not looking into making a prediction for every company, just pick out the better ones). I guess what I should ask is if there are methods that can handle missing values (i.e. the classifier implicitly deals with them). I think trees is such a type, although I am not terribly sure. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Edit 1: The scenario is the following:

A venture capital firm would like to predict which companies are interesting based on some stats like money raised to date, the industry they are in, # of employees, etc. And they get this information from 3 online databases. In some of the companies available on the databases, information are missing. My guess would be they are missing because the firm is small or has been inactive for a period time, and hence not updates. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's not the worst since it's not part of your so-to-say core courses, but still failing a course does not make your transcript look good.

I am assuming what you are taking is MAT223 (correct me if I am wrong), and since this course usually does not curve students, I'd recommend speaking with your instructor immediately and explain your situation to him/her (e.g. I don't come from math and am taking the course for my own curiosity, I need to go to grad school for reasons xyz, blah blah blah). Sometimes this will help because the instructor is often a student (grad) himself, so they have some sympathy for students (not always true though) and maybe would bump up your mark by a few points. I'd also recommend seeing him in person (prepare your speech) instead of sending emails.

Other than that, not much I can suggest. Perhaps take some easy courses to make up for your GPA if you failed or did badly. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Beyond Money, How Much Support Should VCs Give Startups? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-06-24 01:35:56 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> In the New Yorkers cover story profile, Marc Andreeseen talked about how he and Ben Horowitz are building a different kind of venture capital business.

One of the key elements is offering services to startups within A16zs portfolio beyond money. This approach involves 65 in-house specialists focused on executive talent, tech talent, market development, corporate development, and marketing.

We give our founders the networking superpower, hyper-accelerating someone into a fully functional C.E.O. in five years, Andreessen said.

It got me thinking about whether VCs should be providing services to startups, rather than simply giving them money, advice and, theoretically, networking opportunities. Should VCs serve as service agencies that can proactively meet the needs of portfolio companies directly or indirectly?

Many startup entrepreneurs, particularly first-timers, are smart, but they dont know what they dont know. They may be excellent developers or engineers, but they have limited knowledge or expertise about areas such as sales, marketing, finance or hiring.

To be successful, startups need to make the right decisions about multiple things and hire the right people. Some of their hires will be external  consultants, contractors, part-timers, interns, etc.

The question is how do startups make sure they attract the best talent to drive growth? They could spend time searching for good fits through research, asking their networks for advice, or simply hiring their friends (a common HR tactic).

But perhaps a better approach is having their VC become a one-stop HR destination for whatever a startup needs. Some of these services could be delivered by in-house specialists, while other services could come from a roster of strategic partners.

This could be a more efficient and effective way for startups to operate while VCs would achieve two goals: ensure their startups are making the right decisions to achieve their goals, and delivering value.

For better-financed VCs, it may be financially viable to have in-house expertise. For other VCs, it could involve building a roster of partners with a variety of skills. These partners would not only be hired guns but could be tapped for their expertise in other, non-formal ways  e.g. coffee, phone calls, etc. This would create a success-driven ecosystem that would eliminate some of the operational challenges facing startups.

What do you think? What role should VCs play to ensure the success of their startup investments? Are VCs about capital and advice, or should they be more pro-active?

More: Here are some other thoughts on whether VCs should provide additional services:
 Openview Venture Partners Kyle Lacy on why it makes sense for VCs to provide value-added services
 Vidyards Michael Litt on the importance of selecting the right VC.
