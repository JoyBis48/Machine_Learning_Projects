	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Since WWE is hard on protecting their product now, most of the new talents are given a new, copyrighted name that they can't use elsewhere. 

But there are leftover from the old era, John Cena, Randy Orton and Mark Henry were lucky to debut when trademark is not really important, or in Mark Henry's case, his name, like Kurt Angle, carried it's own weight

So /SC, which talent was the last one was allowed by the WWE to use his or her own name? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Depends. Jann is an exceptional talent that also adapts to the physical side of racing like duck to water. Not many people, especially people that are used to sit on their couch could commit to.

For example Gregger Huttu, who is regarded to be the fastest driver in virtual racing, was totally drained physically when he test a real racing car at Skip Barber: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0p_sCrM1CcI

It helps that Jann's is a footballer, and that he might have trained with his dad. But a normal person who has no physical training prior? he might have a harder time </TEXT>

	<TEXT> the banking means that you would need minimal steering when you use the karousel and if you time it just right, it will spit you out in a straight path. 

I always use that during online races where new drivers would use the upper non banking section and I would just swoop through and overtake them. There is a LOT of time to be gained there

The way the promos are packaged, the video work, the cuts, it feels like watching a TV drama instead of a wrestling show. There is no Kayfabe or suspension of reality since you know it's just a tv drama.

Maybe that's why Cornette hates it due to his old school way. </TEXT>

I'd say the heavier, brushless motor means that you have a better control on your steering (no more gear meshing feeling) and you will get better road feedback as well

	<TITLE> Penalty and Corner Cutting in Project Cars is Pure Bollocks </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-05-15 05:44:48 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I was racing online at Bathurst last night. I was on pole, and was looking forward to a clean race since the other guys were fast on the straights, but my car was fast on the twisty bits, hence I would be out of harm's way when cars thread the needle on the top of the hill

But it turned into a sham quickly. At the start, the guy in third jumped the start, and hit me. Not only that I have now a broken car, I ALSO have deemed to jumped the start, even tho it was not my fault. 

As I trundled along avoiding the mass accident on top of the hill as I expected to happen, I pitted, sure to be able to challenge for some consolation places. 

But due to the auto pit exit, the bloody game said that I cut the corner when exiting the pits. And I have a bloody 1 MINUTE penalty. 1 minute! How the bloody developers think that 1 minute is a good penalty for corner cutting?

Now that I have lost a lot of time for that penalty, I have to pit for a second time to fix my car, and I thought the first penalty was my own fault, so I slammed on the brakes before the manual control was handed back to me when I exit the pit lane. But lo-behold! I was given ANOTHER BLOODY 1 MINUTE PENALTY.

TL;DR: Corner cutting is buggy, and the penalty should be lessen to 5 seconds </TEXT>

	<TEXT> JAVA uses NPAPI to run on browsers, and for some reason Chrome has disabled it starting in April 2015. Hence live timing sites that relies on JAVA would not work now.

Enabling NPAPI in Chrome Version 42 and later

In your URL bar, enter:

chrome://flags/#enable-npapi 

Click the Enable link for the Enable NPAPI configuration option.

Click the Relaunch button that now appears at the bottom of the configuration page. </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2015-05-08 03:16:44 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Had some issues with Logitech Profiler and Project Cars. When the game starts, apparently Logitech Profiler (running in background) would crash, and restart. This will lead to the game being forced back to the foreground. In some rare cases, the game would not show up even if you click on the icon on the taskbar

Solutions:

If you are using logitech peripherals like controller and steering wheel, run the game in Windowed mode. 

Either that or uninstall Logitech Profiler altogether if you're not using any Logitech peripherals </TEXT>
