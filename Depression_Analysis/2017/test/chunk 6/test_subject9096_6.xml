	<TEXT> Cahokia (and all other Mississippian polities) lacked a system of writing that we know of so *technically* not a civilization (although it meets all the other criteria). I tend to leave it at complex society and call it a day. There are many problems with the current definition of civilization, especially the implication that cultures that don't meet the criteria are 'uncivilized.' </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The gameplay is very similar. The graphics, 'mons, and physics are updated of course and there are a couple more things to interact with on the table. Also Spoink shoots your pinball so you can control the speed of the ball, something which the original version lacks. Two thumbs up can recommend.

Does not rumble though. :( </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My boyfriend and I are going for our first trip together in May! 3 (70 days!!)

We are staying at POP Century and checking in on May 5th. Our first night there we are having dinner at Boatwrights at Port Orleans Riverside. Following that, my plan is to head over to the Polynesian for a Lapu Lapu at the Tambu Lounge while we watch Wishes from the beach. Then back home, since we have an early day the next day!

May 6th we have booked the Star Wars Galactic Dine In Character Breakfast at Hollywood Studios for 8:25 AM! I am SO EXCITED about this! My fastpasses for HS will include Toy Story, Tower of Terror and Star Tours. I'd also like to see the Indiana Jones Stunt Spectacular and MuppetVision 3D.

We are then park hopping to Epcot where we will drink and snack our way around the world showcase and flower and garden festival. Hopefully we can also ride Spaceship Earth! We have dinner reservations at Akershus after which we will find a spot for IllumiNations. RIGHT AFTER IllumiNations we will beat it to the Monorail and head to the Magic Kingdom. Hopefully we will arrive in time for Wishes! Seeing it from the Monorail height is pretty awesome. Finally, we will catch the Electric Parade then call it a night.

May 7 we will get up SUPER EARLY for EMH at the Magic Kingdom! I plan on filling myself with Mickey Waffles at the POP restaurant. Then we will try and get to the park in time for the opening show! My plan is to FP+ Peter Pan, 7 Dwarves, and Buzz Lightyear. I plan to head to Space Mountain first thing, do Buzz, then turn around and do Pirates, Haunted Mansion, then spend most of our time in Fantasyland getting all the major rides. We currently have lunch reservations for Tony's, but I am crossing my fingers I will be able to get Be Our Guest tomorrow! We will finish our day in the Magic Kingdom with the new Fantasy Parade.

After that, we will head back to Hollywood Studios! We will do any shows we missed the day before, Rockin Rollercoaster, Star Tours AGAIN! Then, we have dinner reservations at 50's Prime Time Cafe after which we can hopefully grab a seat at Fantasmic! Then finally we will head home and get to sleep in a little hehe.

May 8 we have a late AM breakfast reservation at Olivia's at Old Key West. Then we will take a boat to Downtown Disney where we will look around and shop. We have a late lunch reserved at Fulton's and dinner reservations at Raglan Road. We also have tickets to see Nightwish and Sabaton at House of Blues! :D

May 9- Checkout day. :( I want to walk over the bridge to see Art of Animation and have breakfast or lunch there before we leave.

We are celebrating our 1st Anniversary as a couple and are so excited. 3 </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Absolutely. Although, I must say I only use Photoshop/Illustrator/InDesign out of the suite, so I can only comment on those. I was working at home on a magazine layout for work recently and the XPS navigated the file better than the 6 months old 27 inch iMac I have at work. I missed the big screen though hehe. I have not tried processing HUGE raster files with the XPS yet though. Just edited a batch of photos here at work and the response time was great. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So none of those look Paleo to me. They look Archaic/Woodland but it really depends on the part of the country they came from (context context context!) See if the historical society or one of your professors will help you get it recorded in the state site file. Or even better, perhaps there is a nearby professional firm that can help get it recorded. 

The thing is, the actual stuff you found may be cool and all, but it's a lot more useful to the scientific community when we can study the relationships between the artifacts and any features that may have been present. Remember, you can't put it back once its excavated! </TEXT>
