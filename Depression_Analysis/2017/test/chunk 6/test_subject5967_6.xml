	<TEXT> Spotify was huge for me. I just make a point to listen to a few new albums each week. I try to mix old artists with newer ones too. r/letstalkmusic has been a great resource too. I try to read a little bit about the artist while I'm listening and that usually leads to their influences, which opens up another opportunity to try new music.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I really want to hear an explanation from Pete and Vivek. If they have someone like Karl or JVG linned up, then I won't be upset. If this firing is a result of Malone not living up to expectations, then this firing is outrageous. Look at this roster and tell me with a straight face that it's underachieving. Our best player has missed the last 8 games and we're still less than 2 games out of the 8th spot. I don't think there's a Kings fan alive who isn't pleased with the team's performance this year.


If Malone was fired because we weren't playing the ultempo style Vivek wants to see, then Vivek needs to go. It's about winning games, which we were doing for the first time in 8 years. Style counts for nothing.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is my biggest complaint about MFA, which is still one of my favorite subreddits. I see students asking for advice all the time and it never fails that people suggest the stereotypical MFA uniform. While an OCBD, dark cuffed denim and Allen Edmonds look nice, they're way out of place on a college campus, let alone high school. 


Someone once told me to dress 10% better than the average guy. That way, you look better, but don't stick out like a sore thumb. Given that I went to a university in southern California where the average guy wore a tank top, basketball shorts and flip flops, that wasn't hard. 


To me, dressing well is a combination of looking nice without looking out of place. There's a time and a place for the MFA uniform, but 11th grade isn't it. To be fair, it seems like this is less of an issue now than it was a year ago, but it's a beef I've always had with MFA. 


Sorry for the anti-MFA-circlejerk-circlejerk. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The best one I've made is buffalo chicken. I cook about 1.5 pounds of chicken covered in a bottle of buffalo sauce and dry ranch dressing mix on low for 7-8 hours. Then I just shred it and eat it on a sandwich roll, usually with some broccoli on the side and milk to drink. It's delicious. 

I'm all about simplicity, so if a recipe has more than about 3 ingredients, I probably won't try it. Sometimes I'll just cook chicken breasts in water, shred them, and then mix it with brown rice. Chicken can also be slow cooked in beer, which gives it a different flavor. Check out /r/slowcooking for more recipes. They're a little more adventurous than me.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For the most part. I bought a slow cooker and I cook a ton of chicken in that. I also cook a lot of rice. If I cook 2 cups of rice and 1.5 pounds of chicken, I can get about 3 meals out of that, which I refrigerate and eat over 2-3 days. 

I also make breakfast burritos with eggs, hash browns and sausage. They're delicious, inexpensive and if I eat 2 of them and a glass of milk in one sitting, it's over 1000 calories. I only make about 8 at a time with 10 eggs, but I've seen guys prepare them by the dozen using 40+ eggs. Just wrap them in a paper towel and put them in Tupperware.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ever since I started paying for Spotify, I've been listening to full albums while I lift. It's like killing two birds with one stone since otherwise I would just sit on my ass in my room and listen. I've been going through the White Stripes' catalogue recently. I think their self titled album and White Blood Cells are my favorite to lift to. 


If you like Hash Pipe, give their album Pinkerton a listen. It's my favorite Weezer album. I also keep going back to a band called Battleme. They're just the right pace for me to lift to. 


I also made [this playlist]( http://open.spotify.com/user/swolebuddha/playlist/1gQZicqZROQnFYsbQO0Zp7) of movie scores a while ago. It's good for when you want to feel like Batman while you lift. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes. Part of the appeal of lifting is that it's something I can do alone that is still productive. It's not that I don't enjoy being social. It's just that it takes a lot out of me and I need to recharge. Lifting is something I can do to get my necessary alone time yet be productive, as opposed to watching Netflix.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My dad has fond memories of this Mac and cheese, but the recipe was never written down. I asked grandma, who now has a very poor memory, but she couldn't give me any exact measurements ("a whole gob of cheese", "a splash of milk", etc.). I did my best to recreate the recipe based on what she told me and it turned out pretty darn good.


Boil 2 cups of macaroni in salted water (grandma insisted that the water be salted)


In a baking dish, mix macaroni with approx. 1 cup of cheese. I used sharp cheddar.


Add 1/2 cup of milk

Bake for 10 minutes at 350 degrees, stir, then bake for 10 more minutes. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If my math is correct, it's about 1300 calories. 150 calories per 4 oz of chicken plus I put it on roles that are 130 calories each. I got 3 sandwiches from this batch of 1.6 pounds. I don't know about protein. 


I've seen other recipes that include butter or even cream cheese. That would add some calories if you're desperate.  </TEXT>
