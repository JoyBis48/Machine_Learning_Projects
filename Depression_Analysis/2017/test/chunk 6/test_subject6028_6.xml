	<TEXT>  That's original.

Thank you!

 Gasoline evaporates extremely quickly, which quickly creates a volatile mix. It doesn't help that it's heavier than most atmosphere, so it tends to collect in pools instead of dissipating quickly.

Same!

 I know plenty, and know how to practically apply it, and I apply that knowledge in my every day life.

Are you a firefighter?

 You're the type of person that gets people killed, by not being prepared to handle situations as they come. Many situations won't be about your choice or what you did.

Yeah, so not my problem. 

 Say a car is on fire, and you need to decide how you're going to save a person out of it, will you be prepared to act?

Again, not my problem.

 I have no faith in you except sheer blind luck.

I'd allow access to cars for emergency service members, and government officials. And people with disabilities, such as wheelchair users (or I'd invent some wheelchair highway they can speed down). Everyone else must walk or cycle, or use the premium public transport. </TEXT>
