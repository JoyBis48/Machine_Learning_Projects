	<TEXT> Yes i had the same idea to have trouble while passing by in earth dawn the gate spell had a strong spirit guarding it that was better to run by then defeat the same could apply to this but things that you run into while reaching your destination.

I mean shape change as in metagamic kind of thing shapeshift into a sentient puddle or turn your fist intl solid metal and stuff of thr like the same i have thougbt about the character loosing his sense of identity nothing like trying to change sex and critical glitch i would maybe make it so when you glitch either the spell warps or you are stuck with what you tried to change into for a while even alien hand syndrome if applicable.
I'm typing all of this on my phone so sorry for the grammar. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I thought about that maybe if the character was an older infected that took his training seriously would have to train for how many mny years i know harlequin did but when it comes to immortal elves well...im not that well versed on them snd people tell me to just ignor that </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For Teleport i had the idea for the mage to shift to astral space and get materialize in another place maybe available at high initiation maybe 7-9?

Shapshifting also more than shapechange i'm talking body parts and such.

and finally phasing turn etheral for a moment just dematerializing like a spirit would.

post how would you make them not broken. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well apart from the fluff and character

I see most people that understand a bit about min-maxing actually go for mages

what i feel is that they try to make magic so balanced it looses the element of "magic" of it.

and i think that's a debate that's going for a long time chrome vs mana

which i am not the person to answer it but this thread would be enlightning </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Heavily magic character lacking in alot of other things to boost magic and might be infected with hmhvv while also being very frail so i thought of elric and though that stormbringer would be a nice addition and perhaps be a possible plot point for the gm </TEXT>
