	<TEXT> Man... 
I have an odd relationship with one of my exes. We love one another and we're really close with a weird bond no one can understand. Anyway. In October I was talking to my Mum about said ex and saying I thought his girlfriend might be pregnant. So I had asked him about it and he was surprised as they had just found out but yes, she was pregnant. I knew the moment I got that text message from him that he "wasn't going to be a dad." So I told my mum and although we didn't know what I meant, we figured it was important to remember I had said it. He texted me on Christmas day to tell me she was having a miscarriage. I fully understand the guilt and I wish I could explain where those feelings come from. I haven't been able to look him in the eye since, for feeling like I caused her to lose the baby. </TEXT>

I feel like I've missed something and that bothers me 'cause I'm covered in the damn things all the time. I just chalk it up to sharing a bed with a grouchy black cat and a 30lb border collie with no concept of personal space. But it still bothers me. </TEXT>
