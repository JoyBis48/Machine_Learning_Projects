No one has ever said that. Ever.

I guess you didn't catch the Republican primary debates this year. The audience cheered and shouted "yes, yes" when the moderator said "do you think people without health insurance should just be allowed to die?" </TEXT>

	<TEXT> United Airlines was union-owned for a while. Unfortunately, it was a bunch of *different* unions and they fought amongst themselves more than they had fought the previous ownership.

Unions don't necessarily represent the pure working class. There are middle-class unions and even business-owner unions. In countries like Venezuela some unions are conservative and oppose the Socialist government. In Poland the trade union Solidarity was a big part in bringing down the Communist government.

This is part of why Communists such as Lenin are not necessarily big fans of unions. Lenin criticized "trade union consciousness" as just another form of bourgeois thinking. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Abraham Lincoln was a white supremacist...

That's oversimplified. As a younger man he did think that the "characters" of the races were too different from one another for them to live together in peace, and the best solution was for the slaves to be freed and emigrate to a climate more suited to their culture, like the Caribbean. I think he mentioned Haiti as an example of a successful black Republic being formed in that region.

Also, that was the Lincoln of 1845. The Lincoln of 1865 had come to see the long view of history, and supported not only emancipation but voting rights and the right to hold public office for blacks who owned property or who had served in the military - which is what got him shot by Booth.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If I remember correctly, Bush campaigned on letting younger people opt out of the system altogether, and letting everyone, even those already retired, put their money in 401(k)-style accounts that they could choose to place with mutual fund companies like Fidelity. This is why Gore kept hounding him on the "lockbox" that he was so mocked for. As for the actual bill that got introduced, I don't know if it was that radical in its final version.

At least as it has been reported in the media, Ryan's plan involves replacing Medicare with $6000 vouchers (the per-person cap) with which people could buy private insurance. The government would still subsidize insurance for the elderly, but would no longer guarantee it. Again, this would be phased in, with people over 55 allowed to stay in "traditional" Medicare. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I combined my responses to your two messages here. In case I got too wordy for you I put the **TL;DR** main points of my argument in bold.

.


Holding a belief, just because famous people held, is in general poor form. It is no defense for that belief.

As a non-expert, I am unfortunately reliant on the opinions of these "famous people." Alas, these vary greatly, from transcendentalists like Gdel to straight materialists like Krauss, and every shade in between, so I attempt to find among their views those that seem the most consistent, and which accord most closely with my own phenomenological experience. I admit the possibility that I have failed in this task.

.

 don't know any experts (I.e people who study consciousness and have a grasp of quantum mechanics... Note these are very few) that hold your view. 

Who are some people you know whom you feel have a grasp of both cogsci and QM? I would be interested to read the opinions of these dual experts. Penrose I think comes closest, but you're obviously not a fan.

You are quite right that the debate has mainly been a few adventuresome QM experts saying their field has implications for consciousness, and neuroscientists disagreeing with them (although *philosophers of mind* are sometimes a different story, and are occasionally more receptive to the views of these physicists.)

.


A notorious example is David Bohm and his holonomic brain theory. 

I am not a fan of Bohm. I don't even think his ideas are even coherent, let alone correct.  That the lenses in our eyes somehow keep us from seeing the holographic universe? It sounds like the ravings of a schizophrenic...

.

 In general, there is nothing wrong with being a dualist

Ugh, I disagree. Trying to formulate one fundamental ontology for existence is difficult enough, let alone two. I am not a dualist, at least not in the "two original substances, matter and mind" sense of the word. I don't think you can be a dualist without ultimately falling into the absurdities of Descartes and/or Leibniz. I do think though that a non-formal element is entailed by the existence of the physical world (see below.)

.

How would quantum computing be anti-formalist? How do you think we study quantum computing? It is an extremely formal field.


**I will address QM in general here, as I get to its computing aspect below: QM is extremely formal, perhaps the most formal theory ever devised, but precisely in being so it "heightens the contradictions" of formalism. It resorts to such things as negative probabilities, objects that are both waves and particles at the same time, and, as I learned from your article link, probabilities that don't add up to 1 and that violate the sure-thing principle.**

**This sort of thing, to me, points to the fact that we are trying to study a non-formal aspect of reality with formalist tools, and, however successful the mathematics has been, at root logical incoherence is the result. I will perhaps further irritate you and name-drop the ultimate famous person here and say the Einstein had similar criticisms of the ultimate logical validity of QM.**

.


To me it sounds that by non-formalist, you mean non-physicalist.

Not exactly. My philosophy is closer to people like Tarski and Gdel who wrote on the limitations of formal logic. I would consider them to be anti-Formalists under my definition, though usually this term is not applied to them by historians of philosophy (they reserve it for woolier figures like William James...). 

[And before you say Gdel wasn't a physicalist, I would disagree. To me Platonists are the ultimate physicalists. I won't elaborate more here as we'd go down a very long side-path.]

.


I would also distinguish between a *non*-formalist (someone like Meillassoux who thinks the Universe is a "hyper-chaos" that only *appears* sensible) and an anti-formalist (someone like me who thinks that there is more to the Universe than formal processes.) 

.


For me the physical universe is very real, it is not just the dream of a butterfly or some such nonsense, but, by the very virtue of its being real, it contains a non-formal, though not necessarily non-physical, element, that is, something that can *never be explained* by a formal system. Note that this does not mean the element is mystical or supernatural in any way. 

.


**To me it is no coincidence that QM and consciousness both seem to produce a "decoherence" of logical discourse - it is very difficult to talk about either of them using ordinary logical principles, a sign that they both belong to the non-formal aspect of reality. Do they share any connection beyond a connection of type? My intuition is that they do - and that the vast computing power promised by Quantum Computing and the vast apprehensive ability possessed by consciousness are signs of this link.**

.


Without boring you with an entire manifesto, my "anti-Formalist" view is that formal systems cannot provide a complete description of reality, that logic always needs to refer to a non-logical "ground" in order to avoid contradiction, and therefore there is always a gap between a formal description of reality and the Real itself, and that consciousness lives, at least in part, in this gap.

Where do I get these weird ideas? Well, I see an unnamed but important line of thought in philosophy passing from Hegel to the post-Incompleteness generation of mathematicians, and then through figures like Heidegger and Lacan to modern thinkers such as Badiou (though I don't share the latter's politics.) I've come to think of this as the "anti-Formalist" line of thought, though that's my own term for it, nothing official. If you are not familiar with any of these writers, they hold that each entity contains a gap, a "not-all" within itself that not only allows for but *insists* that something radically "Other" must emerge from within.

.


So yes, I've outed myself as one of those damn Continental-philosophy fanboys, the kind of dupe who you probably think would have been fooled by the Sokal Hoax had I not been in grade school at the time. Do with me as you will!

.


Their ideas on consciousness were very naive and motivated not by a psychological problem but by the physics/philosophy problem of measurement in quantum mechanics. 

I am interested on your views on the measurement problem. Do you think it can be resolved (or dissolved as Wittgenstein would say) without a reference to consciousness, either on a human or a cosmic level? If so, how? [You might be interested in this article](http://www.bigquestionsonline.com/print/138). It is close to my views though I wouldn't use the term "God" as it's too historically freighted.

.


The reason I would like to see this is because I'd've never seen an intelligent defense of quantum mysticism and I would really like to see one. 

You won't get one from me - I'm not a quantum mystic, at least if by that you mean the belief that, say, entanglement means people can have psychic powers, or things of that sort. I am open-minded towards the paranormal, though not a believer. I like to say I don't want to be so open-minded that my brain falls out!

	<TEXT> I was just pointing out that many famous scientists have believed in or theorized about a connection between *biology* and QM, and if we accept that consciousness is a biological process at least on some level, then there may indeed be a QM component to consciousness, just as there is in other biological systems.

You might think the links between quantum effects and cell biology are "nothing special," but until recently biology was thought to be explainable in wholly classical terms, except by some visionaries like Schrdinger,  and now we know that's not true. 

You are right that Gdel was a Platonist, and also right he didn't think that the link between his Theorems and consciousness was related to QM, but you were rubbishing that idea as well, so I thought I'd admit where I stand on that issue as well.

Fundamentally I am an "anti-Formalist" when it comes to consciousness, meaning I think that somehow (whether through QM or Platonic Forms, or some other mechanism), consciousness exists at least in part outside the formal, "billiard-ball" world of classical physics.

Oh, and the fact is I have read what you've read, we just disagree. I don't claim to be an expert, but when the experts disagree, the layman is allowed his opinion.

	<TEXT> Well, to Penrose you would also have to add the even more formidable name of Schrdinger, who theorized on this issue in his "What is Life?" 

As for Gdel I guess this will get me in an even deeper hole with you, but I do indeed think there is a link between the Incompleteness Theorems (there's more than one) and consciousness as well. Of course, Gdel himself believed this, but then, Gdel wasn't a brain scientist and he went crazy, etc. etc. (You can tell I've had this argument before.)

Anyway. I'm not saying microtubules are what links QM effects to consciousness, it could be some other mechanism. Recently some solid links between QM and biology have been found, for example [in the navigational systems of birds](http://arxiv.org/abs/0906.3725). It's not consciousness - yet - but it does show a link between the biological and quantum worlds. 

I am "agnostic" on this link in a strictly scientific-method sense, but in a broader philosophical context, due to what I see as weaknesses in traditional naturalism, yet as someone unwilling to accept dualism or a purely "mystical" explanation for consciousness, the link to quantum processes seems suggestive, though not conclusive. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have not read much technical literature and I realize popular articles on the subject can be sensationalistic or misinformed. However I still think there **might** be a connection between quantum states and consciousness, and there are some well-informed experts (Penrose, for example) who believe so as well. Do I have definite proof? No - that's why I used the word "believe" instead of "know" or "can prove."

	<TEXT> Haha, very civil reply. Anyway, ignoring your nastiness, my hypothesis is that the ability to process information and yet be in observation of the same process simultaneously, which seems to be an ability of human consciousness, might also be a characteristic of these sorts of computers. If quantum computers are possible, being able to calculate in super-position states might grant them this ability. </TEXT>

According to another, more cool legend, the follower was killed not because he made the discovery but because he *talked about it publicly*, revealing esoteric knowledge that was only meant for the Pythagorean elite.

In addition to being mathematicians, the Pythagoreans were also a religious cult. Imagine a cross between the MIT Pure Math faculty and Scientology. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Chalmers sees consciousness as a Cartesian theater when he talks about consciousness is "presented" to him, as if he were a member of the audience watching his senses take the stage. He questions why processes are "accompanied" by experience, as if experience is an extra effort of theatricality for his enjoyment.

But isn't this exactly the case? That the conscious perception of a color is somehow different from say, how a computer would analyze visual wavelengths seems undeniable. Do you believe that a computer sees the color blue just as you do, that it has the same experience? I don't.

This element of theatricality, of presentation, is *precisely* the hard problem. Even if it is an illusion, it seems that this illusion could not arise except from a *prior ground of theatricality* that already exists!

Where I might differ from the Clarmers position is I think computers, probably quantum computers, will someday begin to have these presentations. That will be quite the interesting day. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Israel is held to a different standard because it came into existence as a *modern* Western-supported state, and, in part because of the pressure of modern Western morality, it didn't kick out or kill *all* of the people in the conquered land, though it did plenty of killing, don't kid yourself.

Had Israel been established and expanded in the 19th Century, like the US, and killed, ghettoized or expelled most of the Arabs, as the US did with the Indians, there would be no big debate.

That being said, the rich Arab oil states could easily pay to resettle the Palestinians - say in the Hejaz - but have chosen not to as that would be "giving in" to Israel . The Palestinians I have a lot of sympathy for. Both Israel and their Arab adversaries, though, not so much. </TEXT>

It had nothing to do with economic growth and insufficient amounts of gold being dug up.

	<TEXT> The final goal of Buddhism is Nirvana which only makes sense as opposed to Samsara which is the circle of perpetual birth-and-death. 

What about the view that Nirvana and Samsara are just different attitudes or reactions towards the same reality? Hippie talk and not real Buddhism, some say. I'm not so sure.

In fact, Nirvana is absolute bliss, and is not like nothingness or blackness at all. 

But bliss is still a sensation, and Nirvana is supposed to be super-sensate. Not trying to split hairs but I think it's an important distinction.
