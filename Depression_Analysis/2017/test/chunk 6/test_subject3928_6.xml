	<TEXT> I've been paleo for about 6 months now. I work out regularly (3-5 times a week, including lifting) and am interested in using more supplements. I typically have a scoop of whey protein post-work out, but thought it might be beneficial to do a pre-work out as well. 

Any of you folks find either pre or post workout supplements that support the paleo diet?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My roommates and I threw a big party over the weekend. We woke up to this email on Monday morning: http://i.imgur.com/1sLmP.jpg 

Direct link: http://jptciyh.tumblr.com/ 

We have no clue who it is, but it was signed by John Hammond, owner of Jurassic Park. 

Great joke.
