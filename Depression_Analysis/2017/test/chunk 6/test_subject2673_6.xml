	<TEXT> It seems to me that if an analog is discovered and subsequently marketed as "not for human consumption", then it is treated as if it is not yet scheduled, which implies that it would be legal. The Federal Analog Act specifies that analogs of Schedule I or II substances are only illegal if intended for human consumption:  
  
* (C) [Controlled substance analogue] does not include -
  * (iv) any substance to the extent not intended for human consumption before such an exemption takes effect with respect to that substance.  
  
Let me know if you think I'm interpreting this incorrectly. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> LSZ is an RC analog of LSD that people claim to be stronger and more euphoric. It is unscheduled in the U.S. and can be purchased online from RC vendors. It's a psychedelic but I thought I'd mention it anyway. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> LSD shud be the only one with no taste.

Not necessarily. LSD can have a metallic taste to it. But from my understanding NBOMEs will make your tongue feel numb, while LSD won't. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you're into electronic music, I would suggest Flying Lotus, Boards of Canada, XXYYXX, Emancipator, Tycho and Com Truise.  I would say take care in choosing which Boards of Canada songs you play though since I remember the vibes getting very weird with certain songs. Also, it can't hurt to listen to all the music you're planning on tripping to beforehand so you can carefully choose the vibes you want (i.e. chilled or upbeat). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm hoping for a new class of empathogens or partial agonists of the 5-HT set of receptors. Ideally the bioavailability of these new drugs would be very high, even with more traditional ROAs such as oral or sublingual, in addition to having higher binding affinities for the receptors they target. Perhaps I'm ignorant of the biochemical and/or neuropharmacological limitations on the existence of any drug that fits this profile, but one can hope. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would say try Wolfram Alpha or Mathematica (the former is a subset of Mathematica, but is available online).  
See http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/ref/Zeta.html  
Like EEBrony said however, the best you can get is an approximation.  
However, if you want better precision within Java (i.e. better than using 64-bit floating point), try using java.math.BigDecimal instead of double for the variable z. It's a bit slower since you need to use methods within the BigDecimal class to perform operations, but you get the benefit of arbitrary precision arithmetic as well as better precision. </TEXT>

In all seriousness though, I am of the belief that var == null and var != null seem to be the best for clarity. It also seems to be fairly idiomatic. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Met another ent in real life last weekend at a [5] </TITLE>

	<TEXT> College ent here. So me and my buddy were in my dorm enjoying some bong hits and music last Friday when another guy i know knocks on the door with his friend. After the new guy introduces himself, he sees that I'm already high and asks me if I'm an ent. I get pretty excited and say yes. Apparently we both browse /r/trees every day. He was a very chill guy too.  

Then they told me they both came over intending to get high as fuck. So they both throw $10 and I start packing bowls on bowls. After about 5 hits each they were both about to go to sleep. I think I got to 12 rips, and i got pretty high but i was still awake (tolerance). So i woke them up and jokingly asked if they wanted more, and they both laughed and declined the offer. They both went on their way shortly after. Such a chill night.  
tl;dr i met an ent and we smoked, talked and had a great time. ents are great people. </TEXT>
