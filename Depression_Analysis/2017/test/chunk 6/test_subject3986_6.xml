	<TEXT> I've posted a couple times in this sub and I have ALMOST hit the pan on on my IT Cosmetics Celebration Foundation powder foundation. 

I'm currently looking for a new foundation to try out, but I dont really want to wear powder again. I feel like the coverage is too light to cover up all my flaws and it flakes when I use concealer.

Are there any foundations that are dont appear too oily and wont make drive my face demons insane?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> AM: I wash my face with Philosophy Purity and dab on a little moisturizer before priming (I have a very oily face) 

PM: I use an oil based makeup remover for the eyes, the Philosophy Purity Clear gel (it removes makeup) mixed with an exfoliant and then I use with hazel and then add moisturizer before bed

I've had bad acne since I was 11 and now that I'm 17 my skin has improved but the pores around my nose are atrocious </TEXT>

	<TEXT> if youre up for a bold lip, i'd go for Anastasia Beverly Hills liquid lipstick in Carina! its such a bright pink but not too overpowering :)

But if you dont want to pay alot, I'd suggest Colour Pop Lippie Stix in Cheers </TEXT>
