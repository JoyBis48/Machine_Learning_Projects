	<TEXT> This does cost money though right as I checked the website it's pretty pricey, neither of us really have the money at the moment to be paying for treatments and tests and such, I'm going to have to try and convince her to see someone when she's home in Greece she's just scared of her parents knowing about it and would like to get tests and treatment before she leaves (Which I don't really think is possible given she's leaving Friday) but thank you for the suggestion, I will give it thought I don't want her problem to get worse because she's embarrassed. </TEXT>
