	<TEXT> We had a substitute teacher that looked like elvis and sounded like elvis in art class, the first thing he said was.

"Good morning my name is Mr Balls"

The whole class laughed for 15 minutes non stop while he was standing looking all indifferent, me and a friend kept on laughing and we couldn't breathe.

Next art lesson he was balls gone. Turns out he got fired because someone broke a table in his class.

I said to my mates, "He got sacked"

	<TEXT> I don't have a passion for anything I lost interest in most things about the age of 10 (idk what happened to me maybe some event or one of my childhood operations something gone wrong) after losing it at 10; my time became occupied with philosophy and just wasting time mindlessly or on intellectual things like science and math. I know people who have a passion but it seems pointless, one friend is in love with cars but he wastes all of his money and screws himself over, he says that he loves it and enjoys it but it seems like an illusion and completely unjustified another friend is the exact same but with computers

btw how do you think I lost my passion for life and certain fields like math and technology? </TEXT>

Better examples:


Looking at the time 4:30pm, it's like my brain won't recognise that it's 4:30pm and I have to say to myself 4:30, FOOUURR THIRRTYY, hmm four thirty, that's late, , I HAVE TO DO THINGS (OCD feeling when I affirm that statement to myself) I never used to be like this.

	<TEXT> I hope this doesn't get lost in the comments.

God damn this traumatised my childhood. Even one time I had psychosis after a fever in a village. I was having a dream where I was in a place similar to the pit in the dark knight rises. There was a briefcase being opened with millions of dollars. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

During this I was experiencing the worst feeling in my life it was truly like hell. I then felt like I was a tiny particle in that massive pit, destined to be there for eternity, unseen, unheard, nobody to save me or find me. (I'm an atheist now but my early christian upbringing might be related to the dream)

___________________________________________________________________________________________
 I went into automatic mode where my mind controlled my actions, I walked downstairs and started screaming, "I'm a stick! I'm a stick" I started banging my body against the wall and I managed to snap out of it. Most uncanny event that had ever occurred to me. Few years later I developed depersonalization and severe anxiety, still haven't got rid of it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I sometimes think when two people are having a meaningful conversation, the conversation coming from the two parties is about a different topic, they both are convinced that they are talking about something but they both are applying a reality from their life experience, and words fill the gaps of missing meaning. </TEXT>
