	<TEXT> Thank you r/depression/. I came across this subreddit only the middle of last year and you guys have helped me immensely.

I have a much better understanding of what I feel and why I feel it. Your replies to my few posts and all your posts about your incredibly scary problems are really eye-opening.

The inspiring courage all of you show in standing up, falling, standing up, falling and then amazingly again standing up to your depression is amazing!

Happy (well as happy as we let ourselves be) 2013, great people of this subreddit! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hello all. I'm a SS beginner (BP 120 LBs). Today was the day I was supposed to get to 120 lbs, that is. 

I made a dumb mistake and put on 5 instead of 2.5 on both sides. So the weight was 125 instead of 120.

I did 5, then 4 almost to failure. Then I waited for two minutes and tried again. On the the third lift, the weights jerked a little and I snapped it back on the rack, unevenly at that.

So now my right shoulder hurts. It doesn't hurt too bad, so I'm sure it's not serious. It hurts when I open doors, when I try and lift something with my right hand and so on...

It's not serious enough for a doctor for sure, and I think it'll go away with time. But is there anything I can do in the meanwhile? 

Thanks for any help and sorry if the question is dumb.. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've been reasonably happy for the last two weeks. Very different from the bone-crushing nonsense of the whole of last year.

However, I feel like I'm losing something when I'm happy. When I'm confident. When I'm all these things that I'm supposed to strive towards.

I feel like I'm losing a certain depth in my character. A depth that lets me understand me and the world on such a visceral, sensual level. A depth that lets me relate to myself so intimately. A sorrow that's as loving as it's hurtful.

Maybe it's because I haven't been on the positive side of the emotion axis for so long, but happiness is scary. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Things to do around Mammoth Cave NP </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2012-12-28 02:00:13 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> My friends and I were planning to go camping in Mammoth Cave NP for 2 nights + 3 days over New Years.

But now, I've been hearing that there isn't enough to do in Mammoth Cave NP over three days and that the caves are very similar unless you know about caves, which we don't.

Is that true? If so, are there other long/hard trails to do in/around the NP? 

We'll be carcamping, not backpacking on this trip. That's the only thing that's certain so far.

Any help would be appreciated. Thanks! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've been an AFC all my life.  And I'm 28 now, almost 29. 

Only one three year relationship so far -- AFC, failure, beta, all that crap. 

After that, two years in extreme oneitis with a girl. Friendzoned hard because of my constant need for approval from her. I could have learnt something from her...she was always clear about what she wanted, while I was always thinking about what she wanted, not what I wanted.

Until now. A few weeks back, she suddenly gave me IOI. Maybe it was because I was climbing steps in my inner game ladder, but whatever. Once she told me she was always thinking about me, I completely lost it and went back to being a needy, desperate bitch.

I'm not good at approaching. At all. And other personal problems in my life prevent me from actually meeting new people right now.

How do I deal with her? She gave up on me pretty quickly and started going out with someone else. 

Well, I know what to do. I need to stay away from her at least for a while, but every day I find myself messaging and asking how she's doing, even with no real response.

So, seddit, now that I'm at rock bottom, I know it's all my fault and I need to get back on the change ladder. How do I deal with this? How do I deal with her? </TEXT>

Squats: 150

Deadlift: 145

On rest days I do biking (20-30 miles) or running (6-8 miles) or swimming (not much, maybe 500 yards)

Do those numbers look okay? Sorry I'm asking dumb questions even though it's not Moronic Monday. I really do not have friends who do anything that resembles lifting and it just feels like I'm treading deep waters by myself here.

I'm 6'0 and weigh 160 lbs.

I'm learning PCs on my own (from the book and youtube) and I'm really apprehensive about my form...Any tips about common mistakes that people make are welcome!

	<TEXT> Yes yes, physical activity counts.

My mom was a yoga teacher, and she was pretty far down the road. She told me once, in one of her random deathbed talks, that in the beginning, she thought that meditation was this thing where you needed to sit and be still and think nothing.

But eventually she realized that everything is and can be meditation. If you are completely focused on what you are doing, whatever it is, you are meditating. For her, life was meditation.

However, to start with, pay attention to your breathing. That's all it takes to start off. Keep your eyes open or closed. Walk if you want, but pay attention to your breathing. </TEXT>

It is the curse of famous people to be judged by everyone. Poets, even more since through their poems, we assume we know them as well as they know themselves. Bukowski, even more than that, since honesty (like one of his women) seems to scream and lash out from his poems.

Whether if

You play with your hair
In front of him  

Whether you fuck like animals

Stuffing each other with joy

My head fills with images  
My stomach with pain  
My heart with lead  

I ask him if he wants anything  
He says no

I get myself some tea  
And look away into the  
Glitter of streetlights.

I don't achieve them and I think to myself: _It's not me, it's the goals. They need to be smaller_ and I try yet again.

	<TEXT> But at the same time, NaNo basically lets you write anything and get away with it. 50,000 words of Pokemon fanfiction? Sure. 50,000 words of the same repetitive sentence structure over and over? Fantastic. The word "butt" repeated 50,000 times? You win!

What? No. this month, you're the winner, you're the participant, you're the judge. The website only handles the wordcount.

If a person thinks he/she won by repeating the same word 50,000 times, I don't think the blame rests with the concept of NanoWrimo.

As for Pokemon fanfiction, of course! Who knows what brilliant ideas for space opera, love stories, zombies, adventure you'll come up with on the way to those 50,000 words. 

For me, NanoWriMo is about the side effects more than the drug itself. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Only insofar as the turbulence prevents boundary layer separation. For a well-streamlines body where the laminar boundary layer doesn't separate, laminar flow decreases skin drag for the same form drag. The big difference is, of course, form drag for separated laminar boundary layer vs. attached turbulent BL.

Yup, my bad. You're right!

Hmm..I agree AND disagree with you about circulation theory. I mean, it's the only way to include a viscous phenomena (stagnation point at the trailing edge) in an otherwise completely inviscid analysis. Physically of course, the problem is that we're assuming inviscid flow while squeezing in the effect of viscosity however we can. Because: Without viscosity, we don't have lift. With viscosity, the analysis is crazy. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Quick question about formal shirt (in suit) fit </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2012-11-05 07:38:57 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I recently bought a plain white formal shirt that I thought fit perfectly. However, I went to buy a suit and the salesman guy told me the shirt was too short since the sleeve wasn't visible under the suit. I thought the suit sleeve was too long. He said the suit sleeve was in fact slightly short and the shirt sleeve too short!

The shirt was such that it came up to the end of the wrist. The guy told me that when your hands are relaxed, the suit should come up to 0.5" above the start of the thumb and the shirt all the way to the thumb. He also said my arms are unusually long, so it would be best if I got a shirt tailored.

I trusted him and took the leap. I'm just wondering if what he said actually makes sense...Thanks! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Highly opinionated list ordered based only on the order I thought about them.

1. Kopi -- Coffee's okay, place is very nice, 50c refills
2. Pekara - Coffee's better than okay, place is okay
3. Paradiso - Coffee's pretentiously okay, place is pretentiously okay, everything is pretentiously expensive. 
4. Panera - Coffee's okay (Free refills if you take the mug!), place is okay except for mealtimes
5. Starbucks - Meh
6. Giuliani - :( :( :( :( Best of all, but unfortunately closed.
7. Zojo - Coffee is excellent! Especially the pour-over. Place is nice, but far(rish) from campus... Evidently they use the same coffee as paradiso, but maybe they brew it better? Tastes better for sure. Maybe they're less pretentious.
8. Espresso Royale - Coffee is bad. Place is okay-good depending on where you go.
9. Krannert Intermezzo - Dont' remember the coffee, must have been okay. Place is very nice.
10. Aroma cafe - Beside Pekara, never been there.

I used to go to Kopi because I lived close to it. Then Pekara because that was close too, but the coffee was better. Now I live close to Paradiso and go to Panera. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No. The probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics would in fact, preclude the knowledge of every single initial variable at the time of the big bang!

But, if that knowledge was somehow available.. everything since would be predictable, in my opinion.

However, it is important to note that the "knowledge" itself is included in the variables, since knowledge itself is chemical reactions in the brain. So this question itself is meaningless, in my opinion. This is beyond self-aware, since the reactions that produce knowledge will need to react to themselves...phew...I'm beyond my depth here evidently

EDIT: I guess what I'm saying is that to know what OP is saying we should know is equivalent to saying that we would BE the universe...or an equivalent sized computer. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My friend and I have been traveling quite a bit recently and learning to take good photographs along the way.

We saw a post here recently from the creator of http://stoked.in and were really, really inspired! If the creator is seeing this, Thank you!! 

Well, so I want to start a website for us. It doesn't need to be as good as stoked, of course. But I was curious about what it would cost to have a nice site up and running....We're not particularly interested in selling our prints. It's just something that we can feel happy about..

Is it better to use wordpress.org or to custom-design our own website? Both in terms of design and cost. 

Thank you for any help provided! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You have to make the effort to go to remote places, and then there won't be crowds. When I went to Yellowstone, we stayed away from the tourist spots and were left to ourselves.

One sunrise, I walked a mile from my tent towards the river to get this shot: http://www.flickr.com/photos/pritamps/6227387180/in/photostream And there was absolutely no one apart from me there.

This shot of the Prismatic spring (http://www.flickr.com/photos/pritamps/6227410228/in/photostream), there were crowds around the spring, so we went behind it and climbed a hill. There were still people, but far fewer.

Well I guess the article makes this point too. But for me, as I visit more parks, photography becomes less about the photo than about taking cool pictures because I could make it to an awesome place.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The air flowing over a wing needs to be at least somewhat "straight." With air flowing over and under the wing in the pattern a propeller causes (more-or-less a vortex), you wind up getting a substantial reduction in lift. Sure, there's high speed air over the top of the wing. But it's also over the bottom. In fact, turbofan aircraft may have a lift advantage over prop planes precisely because the air around the engines is going to be less perturbed than the air around a prop.

No no. Air perturbation has nothing (well very little) to do with lift. Turbulent drag is LESS than laminar drag. Channel wing aircraft did produce greater lift than regular aircraft! There were other problems with the aircraft, including construction difficulties, structural problems, slow climb and higher form drag.

Propellers DO increase lift over the wing. There are toy aircraft that wouldn't even fly if this wasn't true. The Bernoulli's explanation for lift in the first place is wrong. You say "more-or-less a vortex". Without a "vortex", there wouldn't be lift at all. The flow behind a propeller is not at all a vortex. It has a vortex structure similar the flow behind a wing, kind of twisted to form of a helix.

	<TEXT> Right you are again. There is significant torque... The engine applies torque (say clockwise), and so the aircraft has to experience a reaction torque (counter clockwise). There are other effects, but this is the main one. 

This generally results in a left turning tendency for the aircraft, which is commonly corrected with rudder input. 

I remember trying a UAV flight simulator and wondering if there was a bug because the aircraft was constantly turning left! The bug was all in my head :-D  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My PhD research is on propeller-aircraft interaction. 
Basically, from my understanding, the high speed airflow from the propellers flowing over the wings would produce more lift at lower speed (relative to the ground), where as the jet counterpart doesn't have the same benefit.

Yes. Completely. But propellers get less and less efficient as speed increases. In fact at a certain point, they start producing negative thrust (Windmilling!) That's why low speed aircraft are propeller-driven and high speed ones are jet driven.

 In the case of prop plane, there's the Bernoulli principle pushing the wings up, but I don't see a force pushing down on the engine and prop.

The propeller doesn't really produce much lift. The flow over the propeller - because of the rotation - is close to tangential to the blade (well ideally :) ) and so the "lift" is thrust. 

Well, the Bernoulli principle is NOT what pushes the wing up or causes lift. The Bernoulli principle is just a relation between velocity and pressure in already established, inviscid flow, whereas lift is impossible in inviscid flow. But that is a separate discussion and not what you asked.

The force that pushes "up" on the wings (and everything directly and indirectly connected to it) is of course, the aircraft lift. The force that pushes down on the engine and the prop is the same as the force that pushes down on everything -- The weight!  </TEXT>
