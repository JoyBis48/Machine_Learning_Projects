	<TEXT> 1. Working for Cracked was less pleasant for me pretty much across the board. Meaner editors, often terrible feedback (admittedly because they had more pitches to read so they felt they had to skim a lot) and political agendas for lists I didn't agree with. 
2. I could write what I wanted for Cracked, but it was pretty much all spec until they posted that it was approved.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Seeing it. I assume what happened was during a period when my brain was developing my sex drive while I was really young, I saw it happening in some cartoon and that somehow got mixed in with my impulses. 

But as far as I know, that might be debunked Freudianism.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 1. I never would think Cracked going "SJW" is one of its problems. I'd say it's real problems is when it reports inaccurately for the sake of clicks. Jason "David Wong" Pargin has numerous articles full of complete bullshit if you actually research them (particularly his private obsession with insisting being overweight is untreatable except through surgery, which his own sources don't condone anymore, or his "Monkeysphere" article.) If a writer reports honestly and gives the facts accurately, it doesn't matter to me what their agenda is. 
2. I assume that was a dig at J. F. Sargent. Well, he was always nice to me but I remember a lot of factual holes being poked in his article about video game prejudices. I haven't read much by him since that I can remember, so I don't know if he does more thorough fact-checking now. 
3. I think Cracked is way better than it used to be.  Much as people get all nostalgic for 2007, that was when Cracked reported straight up horseshit sometimes because they didn't have to cite sources or when Pargin would say a suicide note without a suicide was "gay."  </TEXT>

2. Yes, they often alter written articles. I've had my points about people completely flipped because editorial thought it would fit the tone they wanted better. I would have preferred they just send it back to me with a "do over" note as that would have encouraged me to do more proofreading at a younger age.  </TEXT>

2. As a writer, Listverse is much more open in terms of ideas they publish. I'd never have gotten the film inventor article published at Cracked unless I'd become a columnist. 
3. Listverse doesn't force in certain prejudices against acceptable targets. The fetish art article above would have had a much more judgmental tone if Cracked had accepted it instead. 
4. As a reader, Listverse puts all its content on one page. 
5. As far as I know, Adam Tod Brown isn't an editor at Listverse.  </TEXT>

I am not saying women who have bad experiences as a result of their impaired states deserve anything at all that happens to them but I don't understand why you'd do that in such a risky situation. It just seems to increase the risk of being assaulted, contracting an STD and/or getting impregnated, or having sex with someone you wouldn't want to if you were sober.

	<TEXT> I'm not trying to claim I'm a badass or anything, I just have a thing that if something is going to creep me out, it usually needs to be ugly or aesthetically unpleasant some way or I'll think it looks good. 

For example, I think the images this artist posted (NSFW) http://imgur.com/a/mg9l5 are more beautifully done and awesome than they are creepy. Even this http://i.imgur.com/noEpc2T.jpg is more moody and atmospheric for me than it is cool, but that might be because I used to take walks in the early morning when it was often foggy like that.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I know and have listened to multiple people who love bad movies in person and through podcasts. They will talk about generally traditionally masculine subjects like sports and the like, but when they talk about bad old movies, they won't shut up about hairstyles. Like if they mention Road House or some bad cult movie from the 1980s, mullets and such will come up. I have heard so much about the rat tail Anakin Skywalker has from people that hate the prequels, 1970s hairstyles for movies from that decade, and so on. I have never heard people talk about this in regards to good movies.

	<TEXT> That's the most generic comment I've ever seen on any genre. I've seen this said about anime, comic books, comic book movies, tv shows, folk music, etc. There will always be people who dislike the way things currently are because they don't realize there was lots of forgotten junk in the past and think the past was better because only the classics remain.
