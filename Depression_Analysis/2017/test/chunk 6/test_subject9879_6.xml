	<TEXT> The Macbook Pro is really a great option, and you can use parrallels Desktop to run Windows simultaneously. That said, depending on your budget - try looking at some ASUS systems like the [G501](https://www.asus.com/us/Notebooks_Ultrabooks/G501JW/). They are equally good as the MBP. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Another point is top 10 is a bit fuzzy. For example - in materials science there are multiple subfields like ceramics, polymers etc. Some school may often be better in a subfield than a much higher ranked school. 
But yes, overall rank matters slightly - and the reasons have to do with funding. As someone who has spent their grad career in both a top 10 and a 50th ranked school the difference in financial situations is striking - and that matters a lot, especially if you are an experimentalist. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am a huge Garamond fanatic - and consider the EB Garamond much better than the standard URW Garamond. I have been considering switching over to EB Garamond - not in XeLaTex -- but in pdfLaTex. Has anyone here succesfully done that? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you are a condensed matter physicist, it is easier to enter academia in materials science - rather than physics. Just my 2 cents.

There are also better materials science schools in your vicinity than physics schools ([applying the 12 hour driving limit](http://www.freemaptools.com/how-far-can-i-travel.htm?address=kansas%20city,%20ks speed=60 time=12 accuracy=5 u=miles hw=false m=false mode=DRIVING)) - except for CU Boulder. 

The best physics programs are almost always on the coast (Princeton, Berkeley, Harvard, MIT or Stanford or Cornell). And getting a tenure track position without a top 10 physics degree is fast becoming impossible (MatSE is almost no better in this regard).

But the midwest has several excellent schools - in Illinois (Northwestern, UIUC), Ohio (OSU), Iowa (Iowa State - Ames Lab). 

Of course, if your area of interest is something else then none of the above apply. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The vast majority still use MATLAB. But because of rising costs - groups are switching to Python along with numPy and sciPy. Try getting the Anaconda distribution - it has all the tools you will ever need and is completely free.

I still have high hopes from Julia, but the noises coming from that sector are not always very encouraging. </TEXT>
