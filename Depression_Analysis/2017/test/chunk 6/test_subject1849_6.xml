	<TEXT> I wouldn't recommend getting Powers since Colorado's attack isn't that great. Forwards must score if Powers wants to get assists. Then, again, if you have Colorado Players already on your team from past, keep them there because you will never know what the future will hold and you have double the chances. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Training Field

Spell Card - Field Spell

You can normal summon "roid" machine-type monsters without tributing. "Roid" Monsters can target their own monsters for attacks. When they do, the attacking monster gains 300 ATK and the battling monsters are not destroyed by battle. If this card is destoryed by a card effect, you can add 1 "roid" card from your deck to your hand. 

I slightly added more effects from the anime version. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes in a way, but not exactly. Both parties had liberal, moderate, and conservative wings.

Democrats purged out their conservative southern faction after the New Deal Coalition and the emergence of the social progressives to the dislike of Southern Democrats. Republicans purged out the Northeastern Liberal Establishment before the 1980s, but began in the 1964 GOP National Conservation, when they don't want moderation at all/hated the Welfare/Big Government (which had grown under 1950s with an increase in marginal income taxes and new spending) </TEXT>

Drug Cartels, Mass Murders, People still living in shacks, even though they work in manufacturing jobs, pollution in Mexico City, etc. Why are the TPP negotiations in secert, if everybody benefits from trade according to economists? Why do people say that it has to be secert to ensure USA wins a trade? How? i thought in trade... everybody benefits.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I know, but basic economics say yes. Also, most economists during the period of 1980 to 2008 agreed that it worked. Right now, most economists still believe free-trade is a good thing.
