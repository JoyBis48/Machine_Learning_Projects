	<TEXT> What do you mean "employment agreement"?

Employers must pay you for all the time you work. If you're working, you have to get paid for it.  There's no employment agreement that can supersede that. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Eh, your former employer sounds like a jerk. It's a campus job, so it's supposed to be a learning experience as well as employment. 

Giving you the boot without giving you a heads up about your issues and giving you a chance to improve or change would be bad enough in a regular job. For a student job on campus, that's just beyond the pale. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you don't care about keeping your job, why not just report it on up the line. I'm sure the upper management would like to know that you're keeping sensitive customer data on an unsecured, external HD for months after the work is done. 

And hey, maybe the problem actually gets fixed. Worst case, your boss cans you and you collect unemployment.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Personalized pavers that once lined Clark and Addison streets near Wrigley Field, home of Chicago Cubs, have been found around Pontiac, purportedly coming from the nearby landfill. The bricks had been billed as permanent fixtures by the Cubs organization when they began selling them in 2006.

The Chicago Cubs began selling the pavers near the holiday season in 2006, inviting fans to purchase brick pavers on which they could engrave personalized messages, up to a maximum of three lines and 15 characters per line. Prices varied, but were typically around $160. </TEXT>

It's important to remember that Moore changed these characters quite a bit when writing Watchmen. Nite Owl and Rorschach are maybe the closest to their Charlton equivalents. Silk Spectre is almost nothing like Nightshade and in fact her outfit is based partially on another 40's heroine, Phantom Lady. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Never get out of the car. Never ever get out of the car in a situation like that.

My driver's ed teacher told me a story of a student of his who loved to fight. Big guy. Strong. Loved to scrap.

So one day he gets rear ended and he gets out of the car, fists up, ready to mix it up.

The other guy just shoots him.

A couple years back I was driving to work after dropping off my daughter and some asshole in a landscaping truck is behind me and honking every time I stop at a stop sign. Like he doesn't understand the concept. 

It's a nice day and I have the window down, so after a couple of these I make a comment or two out the window about his lack of understanding of traffic rules. At the next stop he stops his truck,and gets out. I can see him walking towards me in the side view mirror.

For about a half second I contemplated getting out of the car and teaching this asshole a lesson. Then I'm thinking that I'm a grown man with a family and a mortgage, the last thing I want is to bleed out in the street because someone honked at me at a stop sign. 

So I waited for him to get close, then I put my foot down and drove away. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm sorry, but you've made one of the classic blunders. Never go against a Sicilian when death is on the line.

Oops, sorry. I mean the fairly common mistake of confusing rate with number and how rates of smaller groups change the rates of larger ones.

Now, it's certainly true that the labor force participation rate (LFP) for those 65 and older has been increasing. You can see an increase of a few percent over the last ten years. It's now about 19%. But LFP for the 25 to 64 cohort is 77%, obviously much higher.

The issue isn't that the 65+ cohort is working less than they used to. As your data shows, they're working more. But they still work a lot less than younger Americans and since they're increasing as a percentage of the total population, 12.4% to 13% based on census data, the overall LFP rate goes down. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Nicely done, although the song is doing a lot of the heavy lifting.

I accidentally played the S2 teaser trailer at work and as soon as the sound came out of the speakers my co-worker spun around and was like, "Holy crap. What's that?" </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sure, but the long-term decline in the the labor participation rate [is mostly structural](http://www.factcheck.org/2015/03/declining-labor-participation-rates/).  The US population is aging and the Boomers are retiring. A lot of people checked out of the economy early due to the Great Recession and they're not coming back. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sure they do. There are [six different official unemployment calculations](http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t15.htm), each calculating the number based on different factors.

The one we normally consider to be the official unemployment rate, the one that gets quoted in the media, is U3.  </TEXT>
