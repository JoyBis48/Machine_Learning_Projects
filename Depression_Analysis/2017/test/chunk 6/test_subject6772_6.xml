	<TEXT> Honestly, I don't care either way. I just come here to post and comment on some news/politics/and a few other things. The bot picked me up. I get all replies to my mail, and it sent like 5/7 messages. Never heard of it, you, etc, and honestly don't give a shit either way.

But looking at reddit rules and such I would speculate that the 'joke' isn't seen as a joke and more as an attempt at harassment of others. Which no one really wants. If you are looking for a reason why one bot is allowed and one is not that seems like the most likely reason.

Just putting my 2 cents in. I do find it funny though that is labeled me/inferred I am some sort of SJW. Now that is a hoot. Damn, people on liberal boards tell me I am libertarian/a little right, conservatives think I am a flaming liberal (not fond of modern day cons myself, more old school and perhaps closer to some UK style cons on some issues).

I really don't care enough about people on reddit and their opinions to bother with bots. But to each their own. Just wish they would leave me out of it.

	<TEXT> **Duggar cached website: "Rape and incest represent heinous crimes and as such should be treated as capital crimes"**

Q. What is your abortion position, and specifically, where do you stand on rape, incest, and threat to the mothers health?

A. If a woman is raped, the rapist should be executed instead of the innocent unborn baby. Adoption is an option. Many couples would love to adopt and are waiting for a baby. Abortion has been and always will be the destruction of an innocent child. Rape and incest represent heinous crimes and as such should be treated as capital crimes. The developing infant committed no crime and should be allowed to live. In the unlikely event that the life of both mother and baby would both be lost (for example, a tubal pregnancy) all should be done to save the life of the mother.

	<TEXT> Demographics: Citizens with guns shooting other citizens.

Since we don't pay citizens and they don't work for us there isn't really much we can do about it other than what we already are. If the people we employ are shooting folks there is a lot more we are empowered to do about it.

Can't control everyone else, but the people who are supposed to answer to us we should be able to. Oddly enough, conservatives are the ones who most get in the way and try to shield employees who don't do their jobs properly.

People with power (guns) abuse that power and we arrest them, give them a trial, send them to jail.

People with power (cops) abuse that power and some people set up gofundme accounts to cheer them on and claim that they just shot people because they were scared (notice they never want to look at details when it isn't cops shooting people - they just look at the numbers....) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not fully. People break the laws all day long - every time someone speeds, doesn't use a turn signal, etc they are not obeying the law.

Police have the ability to detain/arrest people and deliver them to where justice can be served - it is all part of a process. Cops are rarely at the scene of a crime when it happens (robberies, rapes, murders, etc). They are there to be called if someone sees something going wrong or survives something.

You know, the basic "If you help people it will encourage people to become homeless to get free stuff" brigade.

Right. Because people want to be homeless for a year or more and suffering just to get a cheap place to live * facepalm* 

Reminds of how conservatives have been preaching that if we extend unemployment benefits people won't look for work, and then turn around and claim there aren't any jobs because of evil ole Obama. Again, thinking that people enjoy taking huge cuts in pay and having an uncertain future.

These are the same folks who yammer on about us needing to pay more money for more wars so that we can have peace. We inaded Iraq? Let's do it again! And hey, while over there let's hit up Iran too.

Maybe those countries don't want us to invade them, maybe they don't want our 'help', and maybe a lot of us don't want to spend money on more wars and killing but actually helping people here - because it isn't terrorism or Iraq that is causing the pain/suffering/death here. 

Dear conservatives, stop being so damn stupid when it comes it basic crap so many other countries get right. Like health care/single payer. You want to save American lives, focus on what is actually killing them (hint: it isn't terrorism or 'laziness'). </TEXT>

Ohhhh. I see. You think cops should just unload their weapons on unarmed people. Just let their 'animal' instincts take over. After all of those shots you still think a guy should jump on the hood of the car and keep shooting. What are they, storm troopers who can't shoot straight?

Reminds me of conservatives. They want to investigate Benghazi for years but when cops kill people here just shrug and say "They had it coming". Riiight. And if you don't see how the two connect, think about this:

4 Americans died in a hot zone and the right wants someone's head for it - someone here in the US they can blame. So much so they have had multiple investigations and don't blame the people who did it, they never talk about them, but want someone in government held accountable.

Yet, right here in the US, cops can kill unarmed people - not just in this case - and the right just shrugs and blames the people killed and backs the government. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Depends. I spoke up several times on issues, which gets IA(internal affairs) involved. It made my life hell there. 

Imagine a police force like being a very very partisan website when it comes to politics. Sometimes, people don't listen to reason and see anyone who doesn't agree as a threat - ala the old "you are with us or against us".

There has to be a will, not just by a few officers, but by the public and those in power, to take it serious. I was harassed by senior deputies (sgt/lt). It didn't help that I personally knew the sheriff and he had hired me in. Keep in mind, the sheriff is elected and comes and goes, and he/she has to play politics with those who have been there awhile. 

Police forces are, for a big part, political entities. They won't reform themselves from within. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't care how it is sliced and diced, way too many shots were fired at two unarmed people in a car. The cops probably fired more bullets at that car than the entire UK police force has fired this century.

They obviously weren't even looking, just shooting - all based on a 'belief' that the people were armed. When we stop holding cops accountable we are giving them a green light to continue on this path and we will see more of it. 

It is a sad day when you are more afraid of cops who carry guns than citizens that do. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They want to see Obama fail (ala republicans/rush/etc) because if his policies succeeded it would mean that the conservative ones were wrong. So they worked against the US doing better. 

They care about one thing - winning elections. And when they win they want to work to dismantle things from science to epa. Their whole philosophy is stuck in the stone ages and based on 'just pray - god will save us. Oh, and give us money for more weapons, cause we really don't believe god will save us'.

They used 9/11 to make wars, patriot act, tsa, and to consolidate more power - power which, suddenly, they think is wrong since Obama is president. Now, again - rather suddenly, they want lots of investigations into an attack. Something they didn't want much of when it came to 9/11 ("Don't criticize the president, we were attacked, real patriots would stand by him and wave flags!"). </TEXT>

Was it Iraq's massive air force/navy attacking us? Ooops. Probably not. This is why conservatives side with cops - if you are scared, shoot someone and claim it was "Defense".

China and Russia are bigger threats to us than the ME, yet we didn't launch wars against them. Remember that 'cold' war? It stayed cold because more intelligent people were in charge. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So, 2 unarmed people, 130 shots fired, 2 people dead, and the cops were just doing their job.

OK. As a former leo myself I am left asking "Wonder why people have problems with cops?" and the answer seems more and more clear all the time. 

I guess the lesson is - shoot all you want, just tell folks you were reasonably scared, and you have nothing to worry about. Unless, of course, you are a lowly citizen and not a government employee. </TEXT>

A large part of the republican party is incompetent. From Iraq to religion to everything in between, conservatives don't tend to think for themselves anymore and are more interested in screwing over the US and playing politics than they are in actual working to better the country.

They are regressive socially, prefer corporations over their own country, want to remove just about every regulation and regress us back to the times when rivers would catch fire from pollution. </TEXT>

Republicans care more about benghazi than they ever did 9/11 - but then, they don't really care about the US, just punishing those who aren't like them; from gays to democrats the right is still crying over their losses to Obama and work against the US for their party.

Patriotism is just a word they use to control the weak minded folks who vote for them. Wave your flag, clutch your bible, and cheer on sending troops to be injured and killed. It's what those 'patriots' do. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This isn't new. It was reported on 9/13/2012 by CNN (and presumably others).

I guess it is new to people who only cared to hear what they wanted back then and because con news sources were all whining about the video and obama not using the word 'terror' seconds after the attack.

Once more, the right got played by their own news outlets who distracted them.

Even Hillary noted it was a small group (which they were):

http://www.cnn.com/2012/09/12/world/africa/libya-attack-jihadists/

Elsewhere we see that there were folks saying it could have been a planned attack but no one was sure "at that point" (kind of like how folks aren't always sure a cop shooting someone was justified at that point until they investigate).

The admin also said they didn't think it was Al Qaeda, which it wasn't. And "He stressed Zawahiri's threat was only three lines in a forty something minute video tape. Given the language in the tape, analysts would tend not to have concluded an immediate attack was likely."

	<TEXT> Not just the cops - conservatives. If this were a group of black people doing this all we would hear about is "welfare, absent dads, crime rate amongst blacks" and so on and so on.

Then, someone would bring up "Black on Black crime" and whine like little babies about how "Black people don't get upset when citizens kill each other but do when government employees do" as though it means something (in other words, they will ask things like 'why aren't blacks protesting other blacks killing each other?' as though that is even close to an intelligent question).

Now imagine the bikers were muslims....jeeebus, it would be all over fox, every single forum on the net, with people screaming.

White folks do crime? Meh. They don't represent Christians, gun owners, or straight people. They are seen as individuals with problems.

Conservatives aren't exactly smart folks though. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah....no.

The US is so far behind other countries on this it isn't even funny.

I have 5 kids, with a few different ladies, over my near 50 years. Each one is different. Pregnancy and child birth are different for each person. 

Conservative types tend to try to make things simple and compact based on the few. Hence why they are so regressive on things. 

Which is funny - because when it comes to religion (for example) they go on 'belief' and get upset when challenged. When it comes to protestors about government (police) abuses they call everyone looters. When it comes to women having kids they think of them as simple factories and want those women back out and 'producing' again in no time.

And yeah - I agree, add matching time for mother and father. Try having a wife really sick (who, btw, died some years later because of her health issues) and being punished by the company you are working for because you took one day over the allotted 3 to care for her.

Conservatives like to make everything about their real god - money.  </TEXT>
