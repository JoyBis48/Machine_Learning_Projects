Then, I sang a song to cheer myself up. When I felt a little better, I looked around, and said to myself, 'Shit, this isn't my house,'. </TEXT>

slight reverberations excitedly invigorate senses

basic components of thought exist simply minimal

fundamental directional principles ignored by proxy

particular matter and nutrients waltz in currents

altruistic salvation all but an after thought to survival

photopic decisions are a roulette in chance and death

stages recapitulate brethren of a bygone era not lost

isolationism trumps loss neither positive or negative

	<TEXT> Don't worry... my dog found my butt plug and started chewing on it. My brother then found it after that. Asked if I still wanted/get it the fuck away. I threw it away.

But it was rather sad. The butt plug went through a lot with me. Used it as a cabinet ornament in my college dorm. It looked like an elegant doorknob and my roommate didn't realize what it was for months. I loved that little guy.

Well, enough reminiscing.

Any who, fellow gay guy, best of luck. </TEXT>

Like I'll teach the new person about our clients and the area (And apparently some of the buyers think I'll teach them how to groom for free?!?!?!?) Also included in this package, are kennels, the tub, a grooming table, dryers, and all of our 6 years worth of clients.

I want to stay. I like the salon a lot, and the dogs we get are amazing. I just don't know what to do. This week, my boss is already packing up her stuff and has a friend that has the key to let buyers come by. So essentially, I don't have a job this week. I'm just going to people's houses that call me. 

With all this in mind, please, please, please, someone make some sense of this situation, any advice would be wonderful. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was in 6th grade. I woke up in the morning and saw my mom crying in front of the tv. She told me I still had to go to school. Everyone was talking about it on the bus. I remember joking about it, making nazi and muslim references to it with a mormon friend of mine.

I got to class and every single teacher had the tv on. If they wanted to do the lecture, they'd just turn the volume off and continue with the lesson. One teacher, being a veteran and having his brother overseas already, scraped the entire lesson and just had us watch the news. He told us on a later day that he would like to put Osama Bin Laden in a chair and have pigs eat him alive, like in Hannibal. 

A few months later, we went toilet papering in our neighborhood. Got the wrong house (we thought it was an acquaintance of ours), but it ended up being a muslim family. Cops were called (I ran). My brother and friends told us the family thought it was a hate crime, some sort of retribution for what happened. My friend (the mormon one) made them cookies, and everyone cleaned up the mess. All was well.

But those were some fucked up times man.  </TEXT>

In that sense, gender and sexuality are two different things. 

It's all really complicated and hard to explain. I might suggest popping in to an AskReddit and be like, "wtf, someone explain this to me." That could be funny.

Edit: Oh, also, genitalia are none of your business. I couldn't think of a nice way to put that, but it's true. I have been put down for asking about that myself. Good way to get smacked. I don't suggest it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, hence the deletion. I'll be civil. 

So before it was more mainstream to be gay, lesbian, whatever, individuals that didn't fit within gender archetypes didn't have the luxury of being in the closet. Men with higher pitched voices, intersex individuals, women that had no interest in feminine things. These people were the first to be out, and were usually ostracized for such. They probably didn't want to 'look' or 'act' queer, because it could mean death, imprisonment, your life getting turned upside down. People within a percentage of our population don't fit gender archetypes, it's most likely a mix of genetics and upbringing. Some parents know their child will end up gay. Some are thrown for a loop.

The world is a funny thing, but it takes all the colors to make a rainbow.

And i was being a dick. So here's my take. My apologies. </TEXT>

I have a question about same sex marriage. My partner and I are both young, and have been flirting with the idea. When it comes to the news though, we're both extremely confused what's going to happen. Both the states we currently live in have legal same sex marriage, but what court case would take it to the Supremem Court? Why was it such a big deal that the court passed on hearing the case before them?

Again, thanks for doing this AMA! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I simply think too many people are misdiagnosed, or are really addicts, and not suffering a mental disorder, and then some are doing both, and some are neither, just like doing drugs...

And enough is enough. Let's take away a BIG problem, for an entire year, and see what's left, BEFORE we pump people full of pills and put ideas in their head of diagnoses. Maybe? </TEXT>

My dreams were all about smoking, intense paranoia, or regret. For awhile.

I havent dreamt about smoking in 9 or 10 months </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For me, the hardest time was the first 3 months. I had to understand why they were difficult, so I read a lot of material on withdrawal symptoms. A lot of which can be found on the Marijuana Anonymous website.

Also, out of sight, out of mind. I didn't keep mementos or pieces or pretty bongs.

I drank a ton of water. I limited fatty foods. I kept in contact with people that would support me, and just eventually stopped talking to the ones that rather me just smoke with them. It was less deliberate, and more natural.

I got a job as soon as possible, to eat up my time. I'm already a trained dog groomer, so it wasn't that difficult to find one. Especially since by month 4, I was pissing clean. Problem was, most of my grooming was done high, so their was a bit of relearning to do that I'm still dealing with a year later.

I can't really tell you much what to do, but if you have any other specific questions, I can tell you what worked for me.

	<TEXT> You raise an interesting point, taxation and dogs, specifically gun and working breeds.

Back in Europe a hundred or so years ago, working dogs and the sort were not taxed. They had their tails docked to prove it. 'Pet' dogs had full tails, and were thusly taxed.

Modern day licensing has nearly wiped out canine rabies in America, and can be very helpful in returning dogs to owners when lost (micro chipping yeah, but again, not everyone does that). 

I think of it as a dog census. In the grooming world, that break down of breeds that are registered pretty closely matches what I see in the salon. It's good to know what breeds come in in my community to know what tools and the like I'll need to buy.  </TEXT>

Not everyone in LA County, or anywhere, registers there dog. Plenty of reasons. Illegal immigrant, bench warrant, conspiracy theorist, tons and tons of reasons. Also, they don't believe in rabie revaccinations?

Another thing, these least common breeds, are the only one registered in the county. I didn't see that breed but it is most for sure in LA somewhere. Just not on this data sheet of registered list for one reason or another.

Faith? God loves you no matter what. He made you in his image. Period. Not religious? Ignore that.

But just everyday, one best friend after the other, it gets better. People you trust you tell. People that don't need to know, you don't. Most will support you.

Love? When it comes, it'll come. Probably the internet. Scruff, grindr, OKCupid. But not always, as in the words of Frank Sinatra, "Love is a many, splendored thing," and can happen anywhere. Having a network of friends and people you know who are also gay or bi can be a life saver.

Coming out is an everyday process. It is safer in this country then ever before. Our brothers and sisters love us, and it's truly a brighter day.

I'll be rooting for you man.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey, very late to the game, but i thought I might throw in a few things about myself.

I was addicted to weed and alcohol... and pills were fun. Mostly weed. 2 rehabs (1 outdoor wilderness), 4 hospital stays, and a host of doctors visits. Compounded with me being gay and lacking common sense, I was a high risk for everything and anything. I was in it balls deep for about... 6 years, with breaks in-between.

I moved with my partner to a new state, created a new hell for myself, went to a hospital (like seriously, being catered to is what gets me off, hospitals, doctors, rehabs are like icing on an awesome cupcake of addiction), and i said enough was enough. I started in a program, left the hospital early, and have been sober for...

...about a year and a few months. I moved from my partner to continue my sobriety and job searching and education and yadda yadda yah adult stuff, but we are still dating, and i'm going to fly out to see him tomorrow.

Weed addiction is a serious, sometimes deadly issue that gets swept under the rug because of how low risk the drug itself is. People don't die from smoking weed, but they sure as hell can ruin their lively hoods. 

Well. That's my $3.50. Hope to strike a chord or two. Cheers.

Edit: My life today! Forgot that part. Well, no medications, pray daily, gainfully employed for most of my sobriety, and have great relationships with family and friends. Still dress like a stoner. It's hard to shake off lazy fashion. </TEXT>
