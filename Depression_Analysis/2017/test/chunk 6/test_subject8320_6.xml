	<TEXT> It had a lot of things that turn me off anime *cough cough* INSEST *cough cough*... But seriously one of the main things I didn't like was the tone it was just inconsistent, it goes from goofy cat girl bullshit to horrible multination with no middle ground. The part that killed it for me was was the fight scene between Lucy and that other girl they both looked ridiculous which made it even more stupid when she says "my vector has a better range then yours" which I guess sums it up right their. TO MANY FUCKING CLICHS lets see: goofy sex stuff where another character walks in on them *check* Incest *check* taking a girl home with you who you just found at the beach with no clothing on instead of taking her to the hospital *check* building up a harem *check* having one of those scenes where two characters are comparing their powers in the middle of a fight *check* naked underage girls *check*  just too many clichs  presented with a completely straight face which makes the violence hard to take seriously (it is pretty raw I will say that though) also this is kind of a minor gripe but fucking cat girls with invisible hands coming out of their backs that are basically high frequency blades...... I mean really. It's late here.... So ya fuck you elfen lied </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sytrus has a bunch of cool ones (especially the pads) I'll list afew vst's 

Sakura: sitar 1 (I love Asian strings!)

Harmor: I'm spacing on its name it sounds like some kind of synth that you would hear in a movie like blade runner

Toxic Biohazard: The underwater preset is pretty cool and dreamy

Serum: Any of art of fighters presets (he did a good job on them)

Also I'm not super happy with the melody it sounds inconsistent and the progression sounds off (just listen and you'll understand), thanks in advance for the help :)

	<TEXT> Hello /r/Trance! As the title says, give me some suggestions! I am open to anyone/any kind of trance. Also let me tell you what I listen to normally, I love the harder side of music so hardcore, hardstyle, hard trance things like that I've also noticed that I love music from 2009 (those old hardstyle melodies are one of the things I live for) thank you in advance :) </TEXT>

I'm betting that a lot of you have seen this video but it hasn't been posted here before so I figured why not :), the editing in this video is really good and with out sounding like a Canadian maple tree, it makes me proud to be part of this scene
