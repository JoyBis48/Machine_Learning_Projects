	<TEXT> I try to spend a lot of time with him in his stall at horse shows so he doesn't get bored.  My mom and I were hanging out in there and talking about when our friends were riding later in the day, so she pulled the horse show schedule out of her purse and started to look over it.  He came over and stuck his face right in it and was like, "what is that!?!?!?!".  She laughed and she started "showing" him which competitions our friends were in and when they would happen.  Usually he is very busy and squirms all over, but he just stood there staring and listening and wanted her to talk more.  Really, he loves attention, so he likes lots of things: stories, toys, going for walks, neck scratches, etc.  He just likes to be with people. :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Mr. Tastee was my favorite, and am still, to this day, fascinated by the mystery man in the swirly head.  Even my username is inspired by him!  Was the guy that played Tastee also in other roles on the show?  Or did he only play that one character?  I've always wondered what he looked like, but I'm not sure if seeing the face of Tastee would make my childhood or ruin it.  

Also, do you know why season three of Pete and Pete never got released on DVD?  Where seasons 1 and 2 not selling as well as they had hoped?  Seems like there are a lot of Redditors...errr...people who would rush out to buy season 3.

Edit:  Just found [this](http://www.redbubble.com/people/meganlara/works/8098367-mr-tastees-blue-tornado-bars) online.  Commence purchasing. </TEXT>

Does anyone know if there's something you can do about mods like that?  Is there any sort of place where you can say, "this mod is out of control?"  I feel like so many people are treated unfairly by him.  If you look at his comment history it can be downright cruel.  I'd love to report his actions, but don't know who to contact. </TEXT>

Yeah, you guys are right about the mod on r/horses.  I got banned because I asked him to rephrase one of the subreddit's rules (it was poorly worded and people would get confused and inadvertantly violate it).  Let's make it a better party over here on r/Equestrian! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I work with Morgans.  As for tapping the back legs, we don't ask them to move the back legs, simply move the front ones and stretch out their back legs.  If you mare moves her front legs forward, and the centers the weight of her body on her front legs, her back legs will stretch out.  I don't think Morgans park out differently than TWHs, do they?  Here is a parked out Morgan:http://randstables.com/files/2012/02/BoogieNE.jpg

You can see that he is putting most of his weight on his front legs. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The way my trainers have done it in the past is through patience and repetition.  First you have to teach her how to do it in hand, and then you can move up to doing it under saddle (for the line-up).  Halter your mare and take her out.  You could even do it in cross ties if you want, to make your life easier.  Take a whip, or even the handle of a broom, and gently tap on the back of one of her front legs, saying "down".  "Down" will be your command for parking out.  Then when she moves her foot, lots of praise!!!  Now do the other one, saying "down".  More praise!!!!!!!  Carrots!!!!!  Sometimes horses have problems lining their feet up straight when they are learning to park out.  I've seen my trainers grab the top of the horse's withers and rock them back and forth, to unbalance the horse just a bit and get them to square up their feet.  

Once she does it on the ground with you saying "down", and maybe just tapping a tiny bit or not at all, try it under saddle.  Find a long whip and pretend like you are in the lineup at a show.  Tell her "down", and lean over to tap her legs with the whip.  She'll probably put two and two together after a few tries.  In a show, you won't want to tap her legs with the whip, but you can tap her on the shoulder and tell her "down", and that is a refinement of the command.  Most of our horses park out when they are told "down", and many of them park out automatically when they come into the middle of the ring to stand.  

I hope this makes sense and I hope it helps!  It should be a fun exercise for you and your mare -- you get to learn together!  Good luck, and let me know if you have any more questions.

	<TEXT> Classes at breed shows get big and it's often important to stand out.  The judge may love your horse, but if your horse doesn't have distinctive markings you may get lots in a sea of navy hunt coats!  I show my Morgan in the Hunter Pleasure division, and have one light green coat and one tan/gold coat.  I wear them with dark shirts, and wear the tan coat with dark brown breeches.  I also wear a conservative belt, and sparkly stock pins and number pins.  Some bling is totally ok!  It would look crazy in the H/J circuit, but at a breed show it's very typical.  For reference, here are a few photos to give you an idea:

Tan coat on my gelding: http://i.imgur.com/mDkbs.jpg
Green coat on my mare: http://i.imgur.com/DwQf9.jpg
Green coat on my gelding (a bit washed out by the flash): http://i.imgur.com/fs8Fh.jpg

Hope this helps, and may you have blue ribbon rides!

	<TEXT> I personally have a Stubben Wotan I bought off ebay.  It was only $350, and in amazing condition.  Not sure what you like as far as cushion/support, but I love the Wotan because there is no padding on the seat or knee roll areas, and the knee roll is very small.  Also, the saddle is fairly flat, which fits my horse well and is what I like to ride in, but won't work if your horse has high withers.  

Maybe you like a squishy saddle...if you do, the Wotan is NOT for you, but I do love mine!   :)  Also, I use it for riding at home and showing, and it is a great all around saddle.   </TEXT>
