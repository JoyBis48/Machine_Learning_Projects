	<TEXT> Luckily I have an extra PSU. I'm not sure it got water in it at all though, there was a Playstation sitting on top of it at the time and that was blocking the top fans. Plus, the GPU is monstrous and completely covers the PSU when sitting upright. I opened it up and only saw tiny tiny water droplets on the motherboard and a bit of moisture on the GPU. It just happened a bit ago and the PC was the first thing we took out. </TEXT>
