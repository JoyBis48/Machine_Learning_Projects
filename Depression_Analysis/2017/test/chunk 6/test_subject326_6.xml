	<TEXT> Thank you for posting this OP! I thought I was the only one who believed all the 'gods' are one being that has been interpreted differently by different cultures. I also agree with the thought of moving to another dimension in energy form. Wasn't it Einstein that said energy cannot be created or destroyed, it only changes form? This has made my day :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This sounds like it could be SP, but that doesn't explain the weird coincidences you've encountered. I'm starting to think you may be astral projecting, which would explain the boy seeing an 'angel', but not sure about the woman in the hospital. I've never heard of changing how you look during AP but I guess anything's possible. I agree with the sleep study idea. You are basically videoed as you sleep in a bed in a study room (they're quite comfy btw). I've never undergone one, but my mom works with a company that does. </TEXT>
