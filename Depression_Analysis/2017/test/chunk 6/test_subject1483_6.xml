	<TEXT> **PLEASE READ**

 nbsp;

Please don't give this game any more promotion. They are already trying to sell us exclusive DLC which gives paying players an edge in battle with extra weapons and equipment. We as a community have to stop promoting such bullshit practices by developers because if we don't no one will.

	<TEXT> Not what you are asking but my most recent and surprising glitch was in Witcher 3. **SPOILERS AHEAD** It's when you are travelling through worlds with Avallach [Ciris elf friend, not sure how to pronounce his name] and come across the world with the deadly gas. If you manage to get down onto the lowest level [there are various ways of doing so] You can explore the world, there's nothing there but you can have a run around the ["titty mountains"](https://account.xbox.com/en-gb/screenshot/cd36820b-eed1-4b83-8067-3c73fe5d6465?gamertag=kiwi1990 scid=de360100-3ae5-4fd5-a7da-9d3d6b481c3d) as I like to call them.

 nbsp;

Also my favourite was in World at War where you could go under the map on that tank map and kill everyone from below whilst guarding the glitch entrance with claymores etc. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Just because something looks like it may be a threat does not give the officer the right to murder a civilian. The police have to completely change their manner of conduct to keep in par with the military style of policing that they seem to love so much. Before a single shot is fired you must confirm that the "enemy" is armed and dangerous. A good way of doing this would be making an officer confirm with his partner before opening fire. Instead of just thinking he's a gun totting bad ass sheriff saving the town. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree about the prices for games and subscriptions, they can be a bit outlandish but I'm happy to pay it if it makes gaming a simple and enjoyable experience. Also don't get me wrong either I have nothing against PC gaming, to each his own. What gets me is when people claim PC gaming to be cheaper than console (strictly talking about the rig). I paid 350 for my console and that will last me for the next 5 years or so. I highly doubt you can build a PC for that price which will play all the games that come out in the near future without having to upgrade a few components. I just don't see how it can be cheaper apart from game deals and subscriptions. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Buy the time I have to buy my next console you would have spent the same amount on parts on your PC. PC gamers are constantly swapping out parts because the next game they play requires a better graphics card or more RAM etc etc. Don't get me wrong I have nothing against PC gaming, I just don't like it when people argue that it is cheaper than a console because at the end of the day it really isn't. You could future proff your PC at fit in top of the range parts and then yes it would last a very long time without needing an upgrade but for that price (around 1500-2000) you could buy the next 3-4 generations of consoles. </TEXT>

This would have been any other game and the trailer would've gotten Rekt, but since it's a Bethseda game, let the Reddit circle jerk commence. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ok so I'm in the Elven Ruins collecting the Sunstone. I have obviously had a good look around and picked up a tonne of loot. I have opened all chests, except one which of course is locked. I have searched everywhere, been doing so for a good while now but no luck in finding the god damn key.

 nbsp;

It is the chest in the room with the door [The only room with a door in the entire elven ruins] and also had two ghosts protecting it, but none had the key. Does anybody know where this key is?? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey OP I have an idea for the inventory if you would like to add it in. Drop Down lists like used in the Bestiary and Alchemy tabs. They could still keep the same format as now (i.e weapons and armour, usable items etc) but just add subsections (i.e Oils, bombs, potions etc). That's my two cents, nice list hope they see it! </TEXT>

The description says something along the lines of "Gerlat found this letter as soon as he arrived in White Orchard and proceeded to read it". You may be right by saying it's bugged because i know for a fact the I have raped White Orchard. There is nothing left to do there except this quest (and I hate leaving quests in my quest tab). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ok so I have a treasure hunt which you receive in White Orchard. I never read the letter as I was new to the game and had no idea what I was doing. Now I'm nearing the end and have this treasure quest I cannot complete because I must first read a letter I found at the beginning of the game which I sold not knowing it was important and ofc I have no idea who I sold it too. So yea just keep them, they weigh 0.01 so there is not point in getting rid of them. Hopefully the will update the inventory menu and make a separate section for notes   books. </TEXT>
