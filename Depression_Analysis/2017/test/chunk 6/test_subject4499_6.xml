	<TEXT> There is one film that can make me weep like a baby no matter when I watch it or who is around. That movie is [Awakenings](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099077/), and now that Robin is gone, I fear that movie will be so incredibly sad, that I could not bare it. I fucking loved Robin Williams as an actor, what a fucking tragedy.

EDIT: sorry for cursing. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I remember the controversy that surrounded the band in the media due to their electronic style shift, I was very intrigued. 

I received the album from my brother as a gift on my 18th birthday. The night I got it in the mail I had plans to hike to my friends cabin, as we usually did with whatever free time we had. I didn't go anywhere without my discman and a few albums. Of course I brought this one along with me and played it on a continuous loop for the entire trip. It was how our hikes usually were, especially during the cold winter nights when there wasn't much point in talking over the wind, better off keeping your head down and conserving energy.

This story is becoming more of a nostalgia trip for me than anything else, I apologize. Anyways, I'll never forget the moment we got off the main road and headed into the thick bush during the pitch black of the night, and snow falling like crazy. I fire up track one, everything in its right place, and it ended up being one of the most memorable music moments I have, and it sticks with me more than any concert I have ever been to. I instantly fell in love with Kid A, and listened to it on repeat for weeks, if not months. 

I'm not sure if it was the pitch black forest, trudging through powdered snow that was still falling through the beam of my flashlight that made the moment so goddamn perfect for that album, or if it was the album that made that moment so goddamn perfect. Whatever it was, it is and probably always will be my favorite Radiohead album.

Good times.

EDIT: I don't think this qualifies me as "old", but I remember it clearly so I thought I'd chime in. Or maybe that's me denying the fact I'm quickly getting old. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> To be honest, I'm digging the more upbeat sound of the new album for that reason. I usually listen to heavy prog for the most part, so albums like these are a nice break in between. This is of course when I'm not listening to "Get Lucky" on repeat at my 2 year old's request. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Different strokes for different folks I guess. Saw them live last year I believe it was, and it was so awesome, especially when they broke out Leviathan material. 

It's funny because back in 2003/04 which ever it was, I was browsing a local record store for new music (didn't have a computer or internet at the time), and the cover for Leviathan jumped out at me from across the store. Best impulse buy ever. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would, but if I parked there overnight I can almost guarantee that I would end up getting a ticket and/or towed. Seems like the parking authority only allows assholes to pull this kind of crap, as long as it's consistent. I like the passive aggressive note under the windshield, or maybe even a chalk outline marking "asshole parking". 

EDIT: I forgot I had this, perhaps I should print a couple. [http://i.imgur.com/irOp243.png](http://i.imgur.com/irOp243.png) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've brought it up with the board, and they will "look into it". Another issue I have with this is, this is our shared visitors lot with "NO OVERNIGHT PARKING". Not sure if you can see it on the sign or not but yeah. The absolute gull of some people. The only time it really becomes an inconvenience is the weekends when parking is scarce, so I try my hardest to look the other way throughout the week, but find it really hard as I pass by him everyday. Thanks for the idea.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Newbie to the audiophile world. Looking to invest in a turntable setup, and was wondering if my current [Onkyo TX-NR609](http://www.eu.onkyo.com/en/products/tx-nr609-35517.html) receiver would be sufficient. Not only am I very happy with its sound (I play 320 kbps MP3's through a PS3) but I am restricted for space in my man cave, investing in a separate receiver would be a challenge. 

What would be a decent beginner turntable setup, and how could I operate it through my current receiver? I'd like to keep my budget around the $500 CAD mark, but as always, am willing to weigh my options.

Thanks. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I really liked the live suggestion made by /u/sowr in my original post. The idea that their performance art currently best represents the band really stuck with me. It's a theme of its own when you think about it, a theme which is most relevant. 

Again I will reiterate that I am no photoshop expert, and there are probably many around here better suited for the task.
I would just really like to see a change from what we currently have.

EDIT: TL;DR The live tool experience best represents the band in my opinion. </TEXT>
