The model they used was most scientifically accurate when compared to all the others they used. It likely had more to do with the capability of their hardware.  They didn't use super computers, like the one's scientists use, to make the fucking movie.    

He didn't say it was the most scientifically accurate that the scientific community is capable of producing.    </TEXT>

If you have this bug can you try rebooting with it plugged in and report if it works?  Also which model and rom are you using? (or if you're just stock)...

	<TEXT> Good luck to him if he has a locked down USA phone.   Especially verizon... I don't even think they have root yet.   

Just say no to locked carrier phones.   You get jammed into a 2 year contract and you can't take your phone with you or change it how you please.... so you pay for a phone you don't REALLY own.  

Fuck that shit... plenty of third party sellers have financing options... and there's always buy now pay later with paypal.  Hell, even putting the phone on a credit card is cheaper than getting jammed into a 2 year contract and having a phone you don't own.  If you can't pull off financing because your credit is maxed or bad... then you don't need to be buying premium phones and instead paying down your debt.  

If root and recovery is never achieved, the carrier and the bloatware companies continue to make money off your device even after it's fully paid and they've made back their "subsidized" loss.    </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No... we took those tax cuts away.  

[And no the REAL unemployment rate is not 5.3%... its closer to 14%.  Because it doesn't take into account people that have accepted part time work or given up looking for work completely.](http://www.forbes.com/sites/dandiamond/2013/07/05/why-the-real-unemployment-rate-is-higher-than-you-think/)  

So the corporations lost their Bush Tax cuts... which didn't really matter because loopholes have them paying 0 taxes.   

So they continued to enjoy a virtually tax free existance and continued to get tax money paid TO them...  All that time unemployment as been so bad for so long that the way they calculate the numbers makes it appear unemployment is going down... 

But it is not.  So the trickle down economists, the GOP, most the dems, and ANY corporate backed SuperPAC candidate can kiss my ass.    

This is all I have to say on this topic.   Have a nice day. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Only a naive fool would think our employment problems, after the financial collapse, has anything to do with immigration.  Especially whilst corporations are experiencing record breaking profits and enjoying a loophole tax free+tax subsidized existence.    They didn't use any of the corporate welfare we gave them to hire more people and increase wages... as they led us to believe would happen.

	<TEXT> you get those newsmax emails too huh? 

Edit:autoincorrect and additional thought.


They aren't deciding anything.  They don't say "unemployment should be 5%" and then boom we get that.   

They just make an assessment on what the economy can handle.  Believe it or not, if we had 100 percent employment that would be bad.  Too much employment causes the economy to heat up too fast.  Thus you have massive inflation because there's too much money so it's worthless.    </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Quarantine was mandatory in the sense that it was apart if the program's protocols.    

Mandatory does not mean forced.   

In medicine, quarantine means the patient is placed within a controlled environment.   It doesn't mean the patient is imprisoned and punished.  Quarantine can be for a number of safety reasons, but can also can be to maximize effectiveness of treatment.   Quarantine has nothing to do with with the practices you see in movies and television.     

But to you, you ignorantly think it is imprisonment and punishment.  

Lets be clear; the AIDS victims knew that quarantine was apart of the program.   If they didn't want to participate in the government funded program, they had the freedom to seek treatment options on their own.   But who would do that when a program exists that is free and hugely successful?   

So, the informed individual walks into the government clinic, to avail of the free internationally participated medical program, that includes quarantine as a mandatory part of it's protocol.   

There were no guns... and no guns had ever planned on being used. Quarantine was mandatory for those who wished to be apart of the program.  It was not mandatory that every AIDS victim reports for quarantine.  The program was benefitting people so naturally they had a high, probably near 100 percent, participation rate.  Who would pass up a comfortable stay with free food, medicine, counseling, education, and other services???   Only a fool.  

But Cuba means violent oppression and quarantine means forced by men with guns!   I'm embarrassed for you.... i really am.     I don't know how many times it can be said that no one was forced, or is going to be forced,  and at no time were guns ever considered to included in this treatment program.  "Men with guns" is just irrational, doesn't exist, made up, "it could happen" nonsense that was fueled by ignorance and acceptance of propaganda.   But dude dude..... Cuba HAS TO=North Korea because Communism!   LOL. </TEXT>
