	<TEXT> I am using the term socialism because the system you describe, even if you consider it distinct, seems like a version of socialism. 

The history of socialism is quite interesting. There have been many forms proposed. All retained the core elements of government (or community) control over the means of production and distribution, and a government (or community)  centric society at the expense  or individual liberty. Each form has had its own unique elements. 

Did you know that Naziism and Fascism were actually forms of socialism? Both retained the classical elements of socialism while Naziism added extreme racism and Fascism added extreme Nationalism respectively. 

You mentioned the Nordic model as a system you thought worthy of emulating. Albeit, that system works for those few countries at the present time, I do not see such a system working well in most countries. Such a system requires a stable, rich country of homogenous like minded people, in a very stable period in its history.

Do you think such a system would work in poor countries such as current day Guatemala,  or Sudan? What about countries in the Middle East with strong religious fervor?  What about those same Nordic countries during WWII?

I agree with you that the rich have an inordinate and unfair amount  of influence over the rest of the people. Rousseau complained of this as did Marx and many others since. I am not convinced that without oppressive and violent coercion by  government that such  power can be controlled. A revolution might stop such power abuses temporarily but historically a new clique of elites always arises, becomes wealthy, and then goes on to abuse the poor and powerless. 

The history of governance has always been about royalty, warlords,  powerful elites oppressing the powerless and the poor. I fear such a condition is hard wired into human beings.

The only system ever developed that has understood this human reality and instituted steps to combat it is the US Constitutional based Jeffersonian republic model.

That system understood that man, left to himself would always revert to a system of elites imposing their will on the poor and powerless. That system created a series of checks and balances to control abuse of power. That system is slow and cumbersome but it does work. The three branches of government, frequent elections, a hard to amend Constitution, and a right of the people to keep and bear arms all assure that a truly abusive or controlling government can't ever succeed for long. 

In the end, no government is perfect in controlling human nature. 
Any form of government, including the one proposed by you, must grasp that.

	<TEXT> The Nordic model seems to work because the population is homogenous and the countries' military security is heavily secured by the USA. It concerns me that such a government model is not sustainable economically if the US stopped supporting them militarily and the population changes and the welfare states become overburdened by immigrants from the Middle East. 

I also fear that such socialist style governments have had an historically horrendous track record as it pertains to human rights and violence against their own people.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree with much of what you say. Much of the campaign will not involve debate of the issues and proposed solutions by the candidates. Instead the debate will consist of the Left claiming the Right is evil and racist. Each side will talk in platitudes such as "defend the middle class". 

The only political entity that speaks of political change and means it is the Tea Party elements of the GOP. The Tea Party opposes not only the big government, big spending Democrats but also the establishment, old boy, DC insider wing of the GOP. 

The Tea Party stands for lower taxes, smaller government, and less regulation. In essence it stands for greater personal freedom of the people.

	<TEXT>  "Romney made real conservatives stay at home and that's why he lost" to be incorrect. 

and am ignoring those that simply don't or won't vote at all. 

I believe you are missing the fact of the current schism within the GOP between establishment, RINO, DC insiders, and capital "C" Conservatives, Tea Party members, and Libertarians.

While the former group voted for McCain and Romney respectively, the later group stayed away from the polls. The latter group will not support any more milquetoast fax Republican candidates. If a true Conservative becomes the nominee then the latter group will support that candidate in force,

In the end a true Conservative candidate will have the vast support of the GOP, and with that the support of a significant portion of the Independent vote, will outnumber the 33% of the voting public that identifies with the Democrat Party. 

Just as Obama energized the Left, so too will a Conservative candidate energize the Right.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I do not dispute the claim that the climate changes.

I have not been convinced that climate change is due to man's activity in a meaningful way. Obviously there is some anthropogenic effect.

I am concerned that all climate change models have been wrong. That fact alone proves that climate change modelling is imprecise and thus our understanding of climate systems is not well understood. 

I am not convinced that rising CO2 levels is bad for the planet. Historically, CO2 levels have been much higher.

I am concerned that Leftist politics has tainted scientific examination of the climate.

I am concerned that grants and professional scientific advancement are dictated by those with a vested interest in claims of anthropogenic climate change.

I am concerned that those who are pushing climate change are opposed to the scientific method and continued study of the climate.

I am concerned that data on climate change has to be modified for various reasons.

I am concerned that the proposed solutions to climate change involve raising taxes, increasing regulation, and empowering elites.

I am concerned that those solutions will be very expensive and results are not guaranteed and at best would result in almost non existent improvements.

The bottom line is that this is an issue that should be determined entirely by scientists, who can offer reproducible results.

Concepts such as consensus, politics, gaia religious fervor, environmentalism, leftist ideology etc have no place in this issue.

Do you agree or not agree that this issue should be determined by scientists employing the scientific method and that non scientific input should not be considered? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Please refer to my previous comment below. I realize you wish Hitler was not a socialist but he was. Did you know that the acronym "NAZI" stands for National Socialist German Worker's Party?

 Hitler and Mussolini were life long socialist writers and supporters. Both philosophized newer, better forms of socialism that they believed kept the core beliefs of socialism (such as government control over the means of production and distribution and a community based society at the expense of individual liberty) while introducing more effective measures.
 
 
 
 They formed their own versions of socialism (Hitler created socialism with elements of extreme racism and Mussolini created a nationalistic version of socialism.
 
 
 
 If you ever read Marx, you would know that he viewed socialism as a point in a political continuum in which societies began as agrarian, moved into capitalism/industrialism, then evolved into socialism (which included "cooperating" and controlling some capitalist industries in the interest of expediency) and finally moving on to Communism.
 
 
 
 The fact that Hitler and Mussolini used industries does not mean they supported capitalism. It means they were in keeping with socialistic doctrine of controlling (not just owning) the means of production.
 
 
 
 As for your claim that Hitler killed all socialist and communists is partially true. Hitler, as a socialist (Naziism) favored his version of socialism and oppressed all other competing forms of socialism such as the communists. Hitler did not like communists because he thought they were too internationally focused, too theoretical, and contained too many Jews as members.

	<TEXT> We agree that cops are too quick to resort to deadly force.

Can you offer any facts to prove that the GOP is racist, supports racist policies, offers racist candidates? This is a serious question. It is often claimed that they are racists but there is never any proof. I am asking you to simply do a google search and provide me with proof that the GOP is any more racist than any other group in the US.

The Democrats have a long history of overt racism in America: supporting slavery and fighting a war to protect it, Jim Crow laws, creating the KKK, segregation, etc.

Republicans were against slavery (remember Abe Lincoln?), fought a war to end slavery, Ike sent in federal troops to desegregate Southern schools because Democrat governors vehemently opposed integration.

Let's see if YOU can provide proof that the GOP is racist. This should be easy if what you claim is true.

Note: Please do not provide self supporting opinion articles from far Left web sites. 

Thank you </TEXT>

I personally think that cops in this country are too quick to resort to deadly force and shoot people.

	<TEXT> GOP accepts the fact that the climate changes. We do not accept the claim that man is the major cause of climate change nor do we automatically accept the claim that rising CO2 levels is bad for the climate. We believe that the science of climate is not understood to the point that we can simply say "the science is settled". We should continue to experiment and study.

We are further suspicious of the field of climate science being co-opted by Leftist political motives. The issue of climate change should be determined by science and not ulterior financial or political motives.  

I disagree that the science is separate from the proposed solutions. The two are inextricably linked and the solutions of raising taxes, expanding regulation, and empowering elites is the motivation for politicizing the science.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Voter turnout for past 10 election cycles is around 53%

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voter_turnout_in_the_United_States_presidential_elections

The link below shows party identity figures:

http://www.gallup.com/poll/15370/party-affiliation.aspx


Simple math proves my point.

47% of the voting public do not usually vote.

Of that group, approximately a third identify as either Democrat, Republican, or Independent respectively. 

Assume the entire 33% of Democrats vote for the same candidate. 

According to you,  that fact alone would decide an election regardless of how the Republicans or Independents voted.

Result? Your claim is foolish on its face.

Your comment that "The Dems decide if the GOP wins by turning out or not. " is ridiculous on its face. 

Given how closely national elections have been decided, If either party had unusually heavy turnout they would win any given election. 

If Ted Cruz or Scott Walker (or any other candidate that was acceptable to Conservatives was the nominee) then not only would the regular GOP voters vote for him but also the voting block that has stayed home for the past few elections would vote as well. 

The result would be a GOP landslide win.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Don't feel bad (seriously). All Leftists quickly bow out of any in depth debates. I honestly don't know why that is but I assume it's because Leftism and all of it's strains are ideological and not based on hard facts and careful analysis. Leftism is noble in it's proclaimed aims of elevating the common man and alleviating suffering but in practice those goals never seem to  get achieved. Rather, the Left seems to always get into trouble when anyone challenges their policies and coercion and violence are required to enforce compliance. 

The woman in that picture was not risking her life to escape communism, the woman was escaping socialism, totalitarianism, any ism you want to call it but she was trying to escape having others impose their will upon her and coerce her into obedience. 

Best of luck. Peace </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The woman, and thousands of others escaped or tried to escape from East Germany during the cold war. They tried to escape a socialist government that built a wall and under penalty of death tried to keep people in. Why did East Germany do this? Why did the other socialist Warsaw Pact countries do the same thing? Why does Cuba do so today? Why does North Korea do so today?

Socialism has been responsible for the deaths of over 100 million people over the past century. The Soviets, the Maoist Chinese, Castro's Cuba, Pol Pot's Khmer Rouge (the killing fields), Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy, etc to name the most egregious examples.

How can you possibly condone the actions of those socialist regimes? 

ALL Communists are socialist. 

Why do you feel the need to insult me? If you had a strong argument you would not need to do so. 

PS over 100 redditors have made the exact same comment you made about my user name. Not very creative of you to do the same </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That isn't a part of liberal ideology

Not so. Liberal ideology dictates that only poor people choose military service because they have no other alternative. Once in the military, those people are tasked with killing, raping, and oppressing brown people, usually for oil or resources, and as a result, become psychologically damaged and sociopaths. </TEXT>
