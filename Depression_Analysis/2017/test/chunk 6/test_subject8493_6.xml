	<TEXT> Which is the more interesting job - Tower, Tracon or Center? Also, is the pay similar for ATCs in all three facilities? (I would imagine the Tower is more difficult and therefore pays more, but I'm just guessing.)  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Actually they get the weekend off from public school. However, anyone who can afford it will send their kids to "after school" classes in the evenings and weekends. So the kids, especially middle school on up, but even many primary school students, are lucky if they get half a day off on the weekends. They also study from morning until night on week days. And if you think that these after-school classes are fun, extra-curricular stuff, think again. There might be a piano lesson in there, or swimming or tennis (if they're wealthy enough), but it's usually math and English.  </TEXT>
