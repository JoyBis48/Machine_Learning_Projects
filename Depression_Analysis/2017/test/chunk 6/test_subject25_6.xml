	<TEXT> I think a prison architect stream would be the best way to replay the game.Not an everyday thing just maybe once or twice a week would be really nice and a good break in the usual content </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I really like alot of the songs in the Eurotruck simulator stream playlist is there a way to access the playlist ?
I went on to spotify but couldn't find the playlist when I searched "Sips".If anyone has a link or instructions on how to get to the playlist that would be great even a screenshot or shots of all the songs
Thank you in advance @_@
