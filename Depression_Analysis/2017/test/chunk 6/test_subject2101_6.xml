	<TEXT> I'm all for agreeing that the sky isn't falling, but this is still something to take note of:  A customer did something that sling doesn't like, *and they noticed*.  Then, sling *terminated their account*.

Depending on what the customer originally did, or what services they were using, this could be the start of something significant. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Actually, it was in 1999 (I was in Paris for Y2K stuff), and this was by far the smallest car I had ever seen in my life.  These didnt exist in any major cities in the US.  How can you not comprehend that back in 2001 (although I really was thinking of 1999), a car like this was not known by a majority of the American population?

Does that make some sense of it for you? </TEXT>

1. Fury is not a character of any importance in the Civil War story.
1. SLJ has a 9-movie deal at a certain rate. To force the Fury character into Civil War for no good reason would be a total waste of that contracted rate, and make a later movie cost more due to contract negotiations. </TEXT>

But in an earlier movie we see the image of the [comic] Phoenix Force move through the water at Lake Alkali(sp?).  So, a lot of us see that as the Phoenix Force coming to her to save her - showing it as a separate and self-conscious entity, like in the comics.

	<TEXT> I think this is an otaku version of a newish womens-fashion thing I recently started seeing infomercials for.  The "thing" is this band-like fabric that wraps your torso and goes over your pants.  The main thing about it is that if you have a short shirt, if you bend over of whatever, you wont expose your midriff.  If you crouch, you wont expose your panties/whale-tale.

I dunno wtf you call it, but its some sort of modesty apparel, so you can still dress in trampy styles, but not expose your undies. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I recommend 2-3 max.  It can be dangerous going alone with no one to watch for police, and particularly; no one to watch you back from miscreants.

Anything over two, I recommend that you have some distance between each other.   Any additionally paired people that are standing close to each other can appear suspicious.  What looks normal walking down the street or otherwise hanging out, does not look normal behind a building or in the shadows. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> you cannot "stream" without transcoding.  If you want to direct-play subtitles, you can - typically if the subtitle is in a separate file, *and your Plex client supports it*.

As an example, my Samsung TV can direct-play .srt (SubRip) subtitles.  So when I use Plex on my local lan, I make efforts to never have to stream/transcode, and am able to direct-play everything. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Although he approached it incorrectly, to give him the benefit of the doubt, he may be attempting to prevent his own liability against sexual harassment.  By this, I mean, he has to constantly observe his students for their physical behavior.  He was to watch for posture, as well as foot/leg/arm/hand positioning.  As a man, I can only imagine this leaves him open to accusations of lecherous behavior.

I dont think there is any "right way" to approach this with him, aside from genuine honesty.  He used stereotypical male humor to approach an issue, that unfortunately perpetuates a sexual bias.  If he seems sincere, it may be better to just let it slide.  Not everyone is an expert in political correctness, nor is every situation an appropriate teaching moment.

Again - only if he seem to be genuinely sincere in his policy reasons, I would approach this after-the-fact, with him directly or to his employer.  Doing anything during will only add to the discomfort of the situation, and continue to downgrade your paid-for learning experience.

Thinking on it more, I wouldn't approach this with him directly.  I would approach the company, so it can be a learning experience at a higher-level, and hopefully be something that is disseminated to all of their staff.  I would keep my name out of it, and if the teacher seemed sincere, I would not name him specifically either.  I would want this to be a positive outcome event, not a negative one.  If it becomes negative (if someone is penalized, loses their job, etc) the moment of positive influence is lost - and negative stereotypes will be further enforced. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  What were the cows like when you were young?

They went on forever and they, when I, we lived in Arizona

And the fields always had little fluffy cows

And they moved down, they were long and clear

And there were lots of stars at night

And when it would rain it would all turn, it, they were beautiful

The most beautiful cows as a matter of fact

The sunsets were purple and red and yellow and on fire

And the cows would catch the colors everywhere

That's neat, 'cause I used to look at them all the time when I was little

You don't see that... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I guess I should have been more specific in my question:  

Why not make/keep this a batch script?  If you have to edit a text file anyway; a batch script is a more visibly open/trustable solution to share.

In this case, I don't see an advantage to compiling this into an .exe, when this doesn't appear to be doing anything outside of the conventions of a batch script.

*No attack or offense intended.  I'm intrigued and genuinely curious.* </TEXT>
