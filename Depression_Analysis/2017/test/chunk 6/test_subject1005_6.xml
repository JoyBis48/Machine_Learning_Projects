	<TEXT> Personally, I get sick of everyone constantly bashing The Happening and posting "what? no!" every time it is mentioned. What do you see way too often? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh, I misunderstood. I don't suppose they look like anything. Paradise is of course subjective, so I don't believe one is a penthouse suite and the other a fire pit, although there are passages to "lake of fire" in Revelation. Again, that could be imagery. What I meant initially, is I don't know of a movie that accurately shows a person dying and then living in Heaven for the remainder of the movie, or vice versa.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I believe in heaven and hell. Everlasting paradise and everlasting misery. I think without taking artistic liberties, its kind of hard to make a movie about. Does that make sense? I could be wrong though. There may be a movie I haven't seen or forgot about.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I met Tom Green once after one of his standup shows. His standup, albeit not too great, really humbled himself and he fessed up to knowing he screwed up in showbiz. Kind of made you think the guy was approachable and not just a total weirdo. So, afterwards, I walk up to him just to thank him for his work and whatnot, and the man wouldn't even look me in the eye and respond accordingly. He had this shitty "oh great another fan" way about him that really turned me off from him.    </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Depends on your views of the afterlife ;) As a Christian, there aren't too many movies (at least not that I can think of right now) that depict the afterlife as I believe it. I'm going to go with Beetlejuice. I think it was a super creative approach to the subject.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You could go either way here. Ace displayed a lot of lunacy when he was playing chicken with the truck. He was obviously prepared to be killed in order to prove his balls were huge. However, you don't see that same kind of ballsiness when he's held at gunpoint. He allows himself to submit in front of his friends and walk away defeated. This all being said, I think he is capable of killing Chris BUT it also may have just been another game of chicken.  </TEXT>
