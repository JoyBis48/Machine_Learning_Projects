	<TEXT> [Some snippets from developers](http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/mar/02/htc-vive-developers-react-to-valve-virtual-reality-headset)



**The hand tracking controllers**

  "its the proposed input being included with the headset  two hand tracking controllers  that seems the biggest deal. "

 "The issue here would be if those controllers come with the kit when it comes to retail, as thatll directly affect the numbers of games that support them."


**Walking around...**

 "the best thing: being able to walk around."  

 "The first couple of minutes of Half Life 2 in VR is among the best experiences I have ever had in a game. The ten minutes after that were the most horrible experience I have ever had in a game."
 "Being able to actually walk around and interface with objects in 3D space directly solves important problems, while of course introducing some new ones."


**Time to market ...**

 "The big news is, its due out later this year, potentially beating both the Oculus Rift and Sony Project Morpheus to market."


 "The announcement probably affects the gaming industry more than others. The partnership with Valve is already spreading rumours about VR versions of the companys own titles. It also suggests that the hugely dominant platform, Steam, will be one of the go-to places for VR content in the future. These are very exciting times."

	<TEXT> I'm really excited by Vive from HTC.  It looks like it is not just going to be a Steam gaming device but also gear for a whole range of virtual reality content from the likes of Google and movie studios.

The /r/Vive community should be a great place to keep an eye on what is happening.  2015/2016 is going to be all about virtual reality.  Lets hope it takes off and isn't just a bubble like 3dtv. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks for the illustration.  I think is is fair to say that many developing countries risk following American business model in the absence of strong regulation.  

However,  I was impressed with many south American countries went the other way on this early on. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No.  However, the USA seemed for a while the most [corrupt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_capture
) for a mature economy especially on this issue.


Many other countries had corporations pushing their own voluntary net neutrality code BEFORE the regulators stepped in because corporations fear the regulators elsewhere.

I know I am making sweeping statements.  Hence, I was asking for specific countries that seemed to be at risk of loosing net neutrality or risked following a US decision.. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thursdays historic vote by the Federal Communications Commission to reclassify broadband was not the first but merely the latest step toward regulating speech. The FCC voted to no longer classify broadband as a Title I entity (of the Communications Act) but instead as a Title II entity, like common carriers such as telephone service. The commissions three Democrats approved the change over the dissent of the agencys two Republican commissioners.

Anyone who believes this vote was about preserving a free and open Internet as so-called net neutrality supporters have claimed has not been paying close attention. One only has to revisit statements and actions undertaken by Administration officials in the last several years to understand the end-game.

President Barack Obamas first-term chairman of the FCC was former Harvard Law School classmate, Julius Genachowski. Genachowski directed a multi-pronged effort aimed at increasing government control of news, information, and entertainment.

The FCCs ill-conceived National Broadband Plan, was the first round in moving electronic media (the dominant form of information distribution) from other platforms (e.g. broadcast) to broadband.

The goal, claimed Genachowski, was to make the spectrum occupied by television broadcasters available to other wireless platforms such as cellular telephones. That was merely the excuse. By virtue of the broadband reclassification vote, the regulatory light touch of the Internet, which allowed it flourish in the past couple of decades, was abandoned in favor of the heavy-hand of government regulation.

Perhaps to mollify critics, the agencys Democratic commissioners insist they will exclude Internet service providers from some of the other Title II regulatory burdens placed on telephony.

Does anyone truly believe DC politicians will resist the urge to extract billions of dollars in payments from Internet service providers as they currently do with telephony in order feed the Universal Service Fund? The USF was a reelection windfall for Obama. It was used as a slush fund to hand-out the notoriously nicknamed Obama phones to low-income voters. About 2.2 billion dollars in Obama phones were given away in 2012.

There were other FCC actions that signaled the Democratic majoritys desire to regulate content.

The Future of the Media inquiry fell well-outside the agencys statutory charter. The 468-page report addressed topics in which the agency did not have the expertise to properly evaluate the information it collected including company business models, corporate debt levels, newsroom staffing policies, and print industry operations.

The report contained what could be one of Washington, D.C.s greatest juxtapositions. The executive summarys opening statement was In most ways todays media landscape is more vibrant than ever, offering faster and cheaper distribution networks, fewer barriers to entry, and more ways to consume information. Choice abounds. Apparently, this leads to the conclusion that this better-faster-cheaper-more-abundant media needs government regulation.

Another regulatory agency, the Federal Trade Commission, also unqualified and without statutory authority, launched its own effort to improve journalism. The FTCs Reinvention of Journalism discussed several proposals to reinvent journalism, including some that would drastically alter the media landscape and severely impede a free press.

The staff discussion draft suggests a news licensing arrangement be adopted, perhaps with the governments help and support. That suggestion of licensing news organizations should send shivers down the spine of any First Amendment supporter.

Another proposal was [a] national Fund for Local News [to] be created with money the Federal Communications Commission now collects from or could impose on telecom users, television and radio broadcast licensees, or Internet service providers [emphasis added]. Does anyone still think the FCC wouldnt demand broadband providers pay into the onerous Universal Service Fund in order to fund government-approved new entities?

I could continue ad infinitum with the FTC report but you get the idea.

Meanwhile, allies of the Obama White House and influential advocates of regulated content, such as Free Press, have been completely transparent in their wishes. They call for the government to spend as much as $30 billion annually to fund approved news operations.

Lawrence Strickling, the Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Communications and Information, is the principal advisor to the president on telecommunications and information policy. As assistant secretary, he proposed the government regulate Internet content. [W]e rely on the Internet for essential social purposes: health, energy, efficiency and education. He added, There [should] be rules or laws created to protect our interests.

In 2009, Cass Sunstein was appointed to head the White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs. Fourteen years earlier his book Democracy and the Problem of Free Speech revealed his hostility toward the First Amendment. Like Free Press and the FTC, he argued (in a subsequent book) in favor of government subsidised (sic) programming, and that the government might impose must carry rules on the most popular Websites, designed to ensure more exposure to substantive questions, and the government implement a Fairness Doctrine for the Internet requiring some websites to offer opposing viewpoints.

One can easily imagine which websites would receive universal carriage and which would be mandated to carry opposing views. </TEXT>
