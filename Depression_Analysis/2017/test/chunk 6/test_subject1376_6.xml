	<TEXT> So in a case where content remains the same but the presentation to the user changes. 

How would your naming change if it was the presentation that remained the same but the content changed?

So for example:

On a portrait phone the container is 100% of the viewport's width and height and an image is displayed. 

On a landscape phone the same container is 100% of the viewport and a different image is displayed.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you do find yourself working in photoshop to create assets [check out Adobe's built in asset generator](http://blogs.adobe.com/photoshopdotcom/2013/09/introducing-adobe-generator-for-photoshop-cc.html). It saves your layers into files based on how you name the layers. It's a huge time saver. </TEXT>
