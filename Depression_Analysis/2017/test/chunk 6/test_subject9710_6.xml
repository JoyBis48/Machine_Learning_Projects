	<TEXT> It rarely happens, but when it does it sucks. Not only do I feel sore when I move, but my legs just ache. I had chocolate milk with protein powder after I worked out, and then ate an actual meal another half hour later. I am getting plenty of water. I could have stretched more afterwards, but this has happened to me before when I have stretched. I'm a rower and I did some pretty intense and long race pieces this morning in a single. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh also I realized that I go on some pretty terrible sugar binges if I completely cut it out of my diet. So have some chocolate chips or a cookie every couple of days or something so you don't lose your mind. It helps with the binge eating and with general mood improvement.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Society tells us that therapy is for the weak but honestly that shit is so damn helpful. I feel like the typical rowing mentality of "push through, you ARE tough enough for this" is also working against my argument here, but if you really want help, you should try it. I'm a 20 year old lightweight female rower, so I know your struggle, and even if it doesn't work out for you, go to two or three sessions and see what happens. See if your school offers anything. 

Also my 2k PB is a 7:41 when I weighted 132 so maybe we should be friends or something? </TEXT>
