	<TEXT> Because people use the "low participation rate" to justify that the economy is poor. You get that a lot from conservatives. It is one of the lingering factors of the recession as well as the aging American population, slower and slower recoveries, etc. Back in the 1950s, less than 60% of Americans were particapating in the labor force, yet the economy was still prosperous mostly due to fact that we won the war, but still.  </TEXT>

Blas Perez, Urruti, Altidore, and Rivero at the moment. Still too early in the season to call.

	<TEXT> A Sacramento MLS expansion would essentially prevent San Diego from getting an MLS team. I don't think MLS will have 2 LA teams, 2 SF Bay teams, 1 in Sacramento, and 1 in San Diego for a total of 6 teams of 1/5 of a 30 team league.

	<DATE> 2015-02-15 21:34:37 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Are the Ultra-Pro 9 pocket sheets good for storage? The cards do have to enter from the sides. Does that effect how I need to handle the binder, if they fall out?

or 

Are the BCW 9 pocket sheets a better alternative because they store cards from the top rather than from the sides?

Thanks for the help. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Get the Box early, if you know that you really want the cards for the archtype. Do note that after supply increases, the prices of single cards will drop until the demand, which is the metagame, favors Nekroz. Then, prices will start to increase faster than supply. If not, the prices will fall to its minimum.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hello! I am just wondering because I have collected a lot of yugioh since the orginal yugioh. I have a lot of commons, a decent amount of rares, and some really good and/or staple cards. I might trade or sell some cards away to make some few dollars. 

What are some good binders to get based on value relative to price?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It is cheaper to buy the box, when the set intially comes out because you get more cards for the Nekroz deck and/or for other decks. Also, since there is a limited supply, when it comes out, the singles will cost abe worth a lot. Don't buy singles, when it intially comes out because the prices will decrease as the supply increases. Buy singles, if you know that market has hit its minimum value. Over time, if that particular deck does well against other decks, demand will rise faster than supply, which cause Singles to be high in value again. If that is the case, just the buy box. </TEXT>
