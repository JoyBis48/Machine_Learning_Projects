	<TEXT> I enter this often, and sometimes even become completely unresponsive and my partner often stops in a panic and checks I'm still ok to continue. We have safe words, and hand gestures for when I am gagged, but never feel I have to use them...but it's always best to have one just in case.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, best of luck...maybe steer clear of those conversations or just sit in and see others reactions and responses. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have been doing this for a while, and started on FL. I have only bean to one munch, and realised it was not for me. I find people at munches to be a little too sociable than me and it did make me nervous. I stuck to meeting people one on one, because it was less overwhelming and I didn't feel under huge pressure. I'd say to just go to a couple, see how you feel and decide after that. A good London one to start with would be U35 weekend drinkies, or perhaps Camden crunch as they are pretty sociable and less shocking lol. 

Don't worry about not being sexually experienced, most guys and girls there are newbies looking for a bit of advice and help on the scene. However don't feel you need to become a social butterfly, just because people on this site are. Do your own thing!

Watch out for safety on FL though, such a photos with your face in (if you are concerned about your career) and also, be wary of the usual posers and fakes! Always send out and ask for a personal photo perhaps with a sign with their username by their face or something. 

Good luck!:) </TEXT>
