You have no claim to respect just because of your age. You could be a no respect deserving asshat and I should respect you because you've seen the 18-fucking hundreds? Fuck you.

	<TEXT> One other thing, how do we as humans know what animals see? How do we know certain animals can see x amount of colors more than we do? If a. We can't see these extra colors
b. We can't see through the animal's eyes
Then how do we know? Or how do we know which animals see in color and which see in black and white?
As far as I know, in reality, animals do not speak our language. Animals can't just say "I see in black and white" or "how many colors do your eyes acknowledge? Mine acknowledge x amount more. Lame human" It just baffles me.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't get total blindness. It might be due to the fact I was blessed with sight, but the idea of total blindness eludes me. The brain processes everything. What process replaces sight when one is blind. There must be something the brain "sees", ironically. Is it total darkness? The eyes must tell the brain something. There can't be no message from the eyes to the brain. It just doesn't make sense. The crazy thing is, I completely understand being completely deaf. Sound doesn't make it to the brain. What happens to visuals between the eye and the brain? Where does the image go? Does the brain just tell itself that everything is pitch black? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have friends I've known for many years that have been music nerds since Jr. High school and some since elementary. They try to explain it every time I ask. After they finish, I remember why I don't ask. They explain it to me the same way they'd explain it to one another. Every time I'm like "Explain it like I'm slow because with this, I am." Still, they explain it like I know wtf is going on. </TEXT>

Btw, your hands must be facing away from you so you see the backs of them. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When I still lived at home, I was allowed to stay as long as I needed but my parents (dad and step mom) had to be able to view my bank account at any given time. This was not a problem since I don't buy much anyway. My problem was the confusion in this rule. My dad said "You shouldn't just go to work, come home, go to work come home and so on. Anyone who works should reward himself every payday with a little something. Even just a
cola on the way home from work." Which I did... then my step mom, within minutes of the purchase, would call my cell phone and bitch me out her : "What did you buy just now?" Me: "I stopped and got a soda for a dollar twenty five" her: " You're supposed to be saving so you can move out!" Me: "I suppose a dollar and a quarter will prevent that huh?" Her: "that's not the point, you need to save everything! You'll never make it on your own if you don't learn to manage your money!" Me: "so a dollar twenty five per week on myself is poor management? Hmm, then with that logic, I'm not as bad as you and dad right? Because a hundred dollars every other week going out to eat has to be worse financially" her: "Don't let it happen again!" Call ends. It was like having two different bosses. Ridiculous bullshit. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My car battery had completely died and lucky enough for me, I had the cash to buy a new one. My car is a 2004 Chrysler Sebring 4 cylinder, 2.4l. With this particular car, you must get behind the wheel well of the front left (driver's side) tire to get to the battery. I got about half way through and it started pouring down rain. I couldn't leave everything as it was because my tire could get stolen or my newly paid for battery could get stolen. I'd be in some real problems then. Anyway, I couldn't get the tire to line up with the bolts so I could put the lug nuts on. I was getting frustrated. Cars and people passed by without even looking at the situation. Had it not been pouring rain, and about 30 degrees Fahrenheit, I would have been fine, but I was freezing and soaked. This guy finally stopped and told me to jack my car up some more (i thought it was already up as far as possible). After a few minutes of that, he had it all lined up and tightened the lug nuts so I was ready to go. Btw, I normally don't have trouble with this stuff, just cold rain makes it seem more complicated.

Tl;dr: I was putting my tire back on my car in pouring rain while it was 30 degrees out (Fahrenheit) and after an hour someone came and helped. </TEXT>
