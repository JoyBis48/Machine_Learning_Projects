Just tell them how you feel and all your symptoms. What helps is to write a list beforehand so they know everything. That's pretty much it. I recommend a psychiatrist over your regular family doctor though. If you're still in college, they usually have free counseling and a psychiatrist on hand for your convenience.  </TEXT>

Not like "taking people's temperatures" but more of your character traits and what eases you/excites you. Discover who you are by what gives you internal pleasure or drive. </TEXT>
