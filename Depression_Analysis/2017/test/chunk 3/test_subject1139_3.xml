	<TEXT> Classic Mushishi bitter-sweetness.

I love the metaphorical use of the cold and snow to express Toki's feeling of numbness after losing his sister. Then use Tae's warmth to express the feeling of caring and comfort that helped Toki to move on. Very simple but well executed. </TEXT>

Sure it's overplayed in the sports genre (across all mediums) but I wouldn't call it nonsene. Top athletes don't reach the highest level of their craft without self-confidence, self-motivation and being pushed by someone. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The way this show presents different story elements is so disjointed. There's just too much stuff going and the show is not doing much in a way of making sense of them. It was kind of forgivable after the 1st episode but after the 2nd one it becomes worrisome.

I hope there's some sort of pay-off here that would justify the chaotic storytelling.

	<TEXT> Holy crap that episode must have been expensive. The animation, background and character detail, and the lighting/shadowing were all on point. The slow-mo stuff also looked smooth and that means more frames of animation which of course is expensive.

That flashback was really really well done. Great editing and timely use of good music. That might be one of the best implementation of flashbacks I've seen in anime. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ugh, I was really hoping it wouldn't do the "beat some sense into him" cliche. That was just bad writing because Ignacio barely exists as a character and all of a sudden he's playing a significant role in the MC's life this late in the season. It also robbed us of a possible good interaction between Kal and Ariel since it really should've been Ariel talking some sense into him. Really, the best thing this anime has going for it is the relationship between Ariel and Kal, and in a very important moment it decided to go away from it.

Pretty disappointed with this show since I really, really liked The Princess and the Pilot. </TEXT>

After a few episodes that made me want to smack Yukine, this episode actually made me sympathize or at the very least empathize with him. Also you're right about Yato, despite his good intentions of wanting to reform Yukine and not give up on him, he really hasn't handled the situation gracefully. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Space Battleship Yamato 2199. It's an excellent space opera not just for an anime but across other mediums. Also, IMO the far and away best anime in 2013.

Go watch it! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The Japanese aren't big time purchasers of DVD/BDs so it makes sense to maximize price in a limited market.


This [ANN article](http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/feature/2012-03-07) explains it better:

The High Prices... Explained!

To a Westerner, the Japanese DVD market seems horribly overpriced. With the average disc running over 7,000 (US$92) and only containing 2-4 episodes of a series, the cost of collecting a single show can easily run several hundred dollars -- more than many American fans spend in a single year. 

The prices actually stem from a business practice we used to have in America, too: rental pricing. Basically, back in the dawn of the home video business, the industry was constructed in a way where "niche" releases were only meant to sell a few thousand copies, mostly to video rental shops. Prices were high (typically $89.95 in America), but video shops benefited from having a wide and semi-exclusive selection of movies that normal people would never pay for. At those prices, only a few thousand sales could mean over a million dollars of revenue. Initially, video industry people didn't think there was much of a market in selling to collectors. 

But the fans proved them wrong. Otaku of all kinds (not just anime fans) started buying the videotapes and laserdiscs, and they bought them at those high prices that were intended just for video stores. There was no reason to lower it. **In fact, there were a few experiments to drop the price to a more affordable amount, but that usually resulted in a slight increase in sales -- not enough to make up for the drop in revenue.**

When you think about it, that makes sense. Most Japanese people live in much smaller homes, and with many more people than their Western counterparts. In most cases, it simply doesn't make sense for Japanese consumers to build a big home media library. Only the hardcore fans of a particular product will usually want to bother owning a tape or DVD, and everyone else relies on rental shops. Media is a specialty market, not a mass-market one, so prices have stayed astronomically high. 

The Japanese Otaku's desire to own anime even at high prices had an unexpected effect: as the rest of the economy tanked and video stores stopped buying every new video release, the otaku kept buying pretty much everything that got released. Before long, the few thousand fans that bought anime DVDs were supporting nearly the entire budget of a show. Even as the rest of the Japanese home video industry lowered their prices to varying degrees, anime stayed at the same high price. It's simply the only way most shows can ever make a profit. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The best they can do is being done already and that is being available on Crunchy, Hulu, Netflix and having some shows in toonami. Late night anime used to be available on cable TV like Sci-fi Channel and Tech-TV/G4 but those channels are niche. Even in those niche channels anime couldn't draw a decent enough audience to be kept on air.

The only anime that hit mainstream are children's shows like Pokemon, Digimon, DBZ and etc. That's back when children's shows in general were popular, when Kid's WB, Fox Kids and afternoon Toonami existed. Those days are long gone.

Non-sitcom animation for adults in general has always been niche. Archer is on a relevant cable network and in its four seasons has never reached 2 million viewers. If an American made animation of that type can't hit mainstream then anime doesn't have much of a chance

	<TEXT> man that romance was a little rushed with that "grab her as she falls ,stare into each others eyes and embrance" scene.

Yeah, that escalated way too quickly and came off kind of cheesey. A nice dialogue where they share a few laughs would have suffice in establishing the romance.
