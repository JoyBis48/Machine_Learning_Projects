	<TITLE> Trouble with Arma 3 </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-01-08 18:51:28 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> A friend of mine gifted me Arma 3 for Christmas (I couldn't be more thankful) but I'm having some FPS troubles.  

I've followed many tutorials to increase my FPS in multiplayer but I'm still getting around 24fps.  

I've had to turn the graphics down extremely low which makes the game very ugly! It's a beautiful game! I want to experience is in its glory.  

Anyhow, I've come to the conclusion that it's my GPU (Radeon 6870) and I'm looking to purchase a new one (can be a refurbished or used one). One that can handle Arma 3 at (hopefully) max settings. I also don't want to spend a fortune. I'd like to spend at max $240.  

What types of GPUs do you all use to run it at high settings? Any ideas or paths would be greatly appreciated.   


Also: I get rekt in every firefight I encounter, I can't turn fast enough...  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Perhaps there is a difference but perhaps not. Everywhere else I've been has a much lighter panang curry, it doesn't look slow cooked from what I can tell. It's not that deep dark red. Makes me sad :(. I just purchased some panang curry paste off of amazon and I'm going to try and make your recipe when it comes in. Man, but nothing beats Madam Mam's panang curry. I could eat it every meal. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> I'm seriously considering law school but need some help on where to start on studying for the LSAT. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-09-17 18:45:23 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I have no idea where to begin. I thought taking this practice test provided [through the LSAC website](http://www.lsac.org/docs/default-source/jd-docs/sampleptjune.pdf) would be a good gauge on where I currently stand. 

So far I figured I suck at the logic games. 

I'd love to be able to score high by the December 8th test but I also know they have one in February too. Would it be better to wait until February?

I'm also not made of money and a lot of these tutoring sessions are half my monthly income. 

I've talked to a couple of friends I know who are in law school and they said that they had both taken courses. I think one did a private tutor (which cost him a shit load) and the other took a princeton review course (the lowest one being $1550 (3/4ths of my income)).

I've looked at the links provided on the sidebar and I hear the Blueprint is a decent service that's only under $900. </TEXT>
