OK, so that's a bad idea. Well... drive away? Wait, they're surrounding me, I might bump into them. "Sorry Mr. Drunk Asshole, I'll put the car in park and let you ruin me financially and destroy my livelihood"

How about the third solution. Oh wait there isn't one. I guess we'll let violent people just walk all over us.

What's your solution exactly? I'd like to hear it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> All you have to do is make more money of the DRM than you would have if you didn't include it. Let's simplify and say that including DRM has the following associated costs (we'll ignore 'brand damage', like people not buying future games, and other costs for simplicities sake):

-Development costs of the DRM: $500
-Lost sales due to customers disliking DRM: $250
-DLC sales lost from unhappy customers: $100
-People returning the game because DRM prevents if from playing: $100
Loss: $950

However, by preventing the game from being torrentable immediately, a small fraction of people who were on the fence about torrenting vs buying now cave in and buy the game. If these people's sales exceed $950, the DRM is worth it. Furthermore, the DRM might be developed for one game, but used for future games, meaning including it in future titles won't even cost the full $500.

Having said that, the data isn't usually as clear cut (hard to quantify gained sales vs lost sales for including DRM, for example). However, I think it's fair to say that these companies have some reasonable data supporting their decisions. I'm not entirely convinced that DRM is 'useless' like most people seem to think. It might be, but the mere fact that companies, with access to way more data about their products than us, are so adamant about using it leads me to believe that there must be some argument for it. Or maybe it is costing them money and they just don't have the data to realise it.

The point is, whether it's actually good or not isn't just a simple case of "people hate it" or "it'll get cracked anyway".

Another pro-DRM argument is maybe the technology is costing them money on products sold today. But maybe they're just using today's products as guinea pigs to make better DRM for a future generation. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Insurance rates are determined by looking at your background and comparing it to statistical info to find a marketable price point that will yield the greatest profit (the goal of any product, really).

So if you have a heart condition, you are obviously more likely to require medical treatment for a heart condition, so it's a bigger risk to them to offer you insurance, hence it costs more. I'm sure you already knew that though.

Makes sense right?

Well, gender has been show to play a huge role in the number of accidents you have.

Men are more likely to be involved in dangerous car crashes, usually where the driver is at fault. However, these don't often result in insurance claims (I don't think?) and are not as numerous as small crashes. On the other hand, women are much more likely to be involved in small crashes that result in insurance payouts.

Hence, women are more expensive to provider coverage for.

I've seen a lot of people complain about this being unfair, but it makes sense to me. If you cover 100 men and 100 women on the same rates, the group of women is going to cost you a lot more.

(I'll just note by saying I've never read the studies this info is based on myself, but I've never heard anyone criticise them so I've always assumed they must be pretty solid and still up to date). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Do homeopaths believe that you can get drunk off a single drop of alcohol in a glass of water? Also does it have to be water? Could I dilute medicine inside milk?

Or vice versa, could I put a drop of milk into water and 'increase' the amount of fats/protein/etc my body gets out of it? Or does it only work with curing things?

Finally, only liquids? Or can I put one part of say, sleeping gas, inside a bag with a ton of 'regular air' and knock myself out?

Basically, what decides what can be diluted and still effective and what can't?

(No, I'm not suggesting homeopathy actually works. I know it's quack medicine. I'm just more interested in what THEY believe). </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2015-04-19 17:49:21 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I made [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/whowouldwin/comments/1tsmsv/sherlock_holmes_gregory_house_and_adrian_monk/) a bit over a year ago. I've decided to redo it, but with some changes, as there were some flaws with it last time.

The contestants this time will be: 

* **Ambrose Monk** replacing Adrian Monk. He is to Adrian what Mycroft is to Sherlock. However, after working closely with a psychologist, he has beaten most of his major issues and is able to compete on Jeopardy with minimal hassle.

* **Gregory House**, however he is fully motivated to win at all costs.

* **Sherlock Holmes** - specifically, the Sherlock from the BBC adaption, enabling him to level the playing field by not being at a 100 year disadvantage.
* **Batman** - Generic Batman
* **Adam West Batman** - From the 60s live action Batman.
* **Shawn Spencer** from the television show Psych.

What order does each contestant come in in the following rounds:

Round 1: Ambrose vs House vs Holmes

Round 2: Batman vs Adam West Batman vs Shawn

Round 3: The winner from each round faces off

Bonus Round: The audience votes for a their favourite contestant. Who most likely wins the audience over with their overall performance, personality and banter with Trebek.

There is no cheating (no, Batman doesn't get the answers beforehand with prep time). It's a legit contest and assume everyone is motivated to win. Because reasons. </TEXT>

The value of Finnegans Wake as a work of literature has been a point of contention since the time of its appearance, in serial form, in literary reviews of the 1920s. Initial response, to both its serialised and final published forms, was almost universally negative. Even close friends and family were disapproving of Joyce's seemingly impenetrable text, with Joyce's brother Stanislaus "rebuk[ing] him for writing an incomprehensible night-book",[198] and former friend Oliver Gogarty believing the book to be a joke </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> The bomb is a special bomb that can only be disarmed with doubles. The 4chan user has no doubles currently on him so he has to get doubles of his own. He uses a nearby laptop to attempt to get the doubles. The laptop comes pre-equipped with 4chan's homepage already loaded and several hundred Christian Bale pictures.

His board of choice, but he must balance the odds of a slow board not being anywhere near doubles (and considering post restrictions) vs the difficulty of timing dubs on a fast board.

Can he do it in time? </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I know it's probably too early, but I'm willing to accept speculation. Basically, I'm hoping to buy one in November as a Christmas present for my brother. However, as I live outside of the US, I will pretty much need to buy it ASAP in order for it to get here in time.

So: thoughts on it's viability as a controller in each genre? I'm most dubious about FPS games. Seems like it would be great for third person games.

What about stuff like Civ V? Would it actually be comfortable for extended periods?

RTS/MOBA are the only genre I'd immediately rule out having not used one. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Stemming from this discussion [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/startrek/comments/30t18v/why_enterprise_is_getting_another_look_and_why/)

It seems a lot of people did not appreciate how much Voyager jumped the shark and filled the Universe with too much overpowered technology that would limit any Trek's set post-Voyager.

The show is also often cited as being one of the low points in the franchise.

So what if it was officially de-canonised and a new Trek took it's place taking place after Deep Space 9? Would you be interested in seeing this happen? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Would this loophole (detailed in the post) work around prostitution laws? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-03-26 12:22:57 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Referring to the US.

It's illegal to hire a prostitute for sex, however it IS legal to hire an actor to have sex with someone else for the production of pornography.

So could four people (we'll say M1, M2, W1 and W2) get around prostitution laws by paying eachother off to make porn?

For example, M1 can't hire W1 as a prostitute. However, he could agree to hire W2 to have sex with M2 and request they film it (and upload the video to the Internet to fully ensure it's purpose as porn, even if it's to a deliberately small and unadvertised website) and in return M2 pays W1 to do the same for M1. M1 and M2 work for free.

Technically it'd just be porn, but the effect is just basic prostitution (providing you're willing to let the video go on the net).

Could you take it a step further and have 'brothels' that match participants for them, acting as an Agent on their behalf, and even include a service to blue the faces? If that's too much hassle, just use really, really low quality film and remove the sound?

To summarise: people basically just hire prostitutes for eachother and call it porn. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Three handicapped, but otherwise perfectly identical Batman's all face up against one another. Each has a unique handicap that will inhibit them in the fight. You may choose any Batman from any continuity or just answer for Batman in general since it's a larger generalisable answer between Batmen anyway.

Each Batman has a handicap: one Batman is missing a single arm (at the shoulder), another is missing a single leg (at the hip) and the third is missing both eyes, but has all limbs intact.

No gadgets that can overcome their handicaps can be used (robot limbs,  sonar replacing his eyes, etc).

**RULES**

-ALL ROUNDS ARE ROUND ROBIN STYLE TOURNAMENTS (three 1v1's as opposed to a single 1v1v1).

-NO PREP TIME IN ANY ROUND. They're thrown right in only finding out who their foe is at the last second.

-No leaving the warehouse

**Round 1:** Hand to hand combat with NO GADGETS. Takes place in an empty warehouse.

**Round 2:** Basic gadgets are allowed. The standard arsenal of Batman minus access to vehicles (so no remote controlling the Batmobile in to run the other Batman over). Takes place in standard warehouse.

**Round 3:** A large warehouse filled with crates, shipping containers and rafters. Completely dark, no lighting, emphasizing Stealth. Each Batman may use gadgets batarangs, grappling hooks and smoke pallets.

**Key**

Just to prevent confusion...

One legged Batman will be referred to as 1L.

One armed = 1A

No eyes = NE </TEXT>

1) When the President moves out, can he take any furniture with him? Does the new President inherit the furniture? What about stuff like mattresses and linen?

2) How much of the White House is the President's personal living space? I mean, does he have a garage he can go mess around in that no one else can enter? A loungeroom? Or is it like living with a ton of roommates all day?

3) Does the President get private Internet access? Can he watch porn with no one knowing?

6) Is there a White House landlord? Can the Pres make renovations as he wants? Or put in a new hook to hang a picture? Is he personally liable if he breaks something? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Alien can be any character from any franchise not born on Earth or part of the human species (so Thor would count, as he was not born on Earth). It also counts interdimensional beings and Gods, etc.

Round 1) It's a 'fist fight' on a football field. Contestants are not allowed their weapons (unless it's part of them).

Round 2) The alien is hunting Duke on the Nostromo. The strongest alien contender in this round can be no bigger than three times a the Xenomorph from the first Alien movie in order for it to move about the ship. Duke gets any and all weapons - but will risk structural damage by using them, as well as use of any of the equipment aboard the Nostromo.

Round 3) On an open field like round 1, but both sides get their equipment (whatever gear is typical of the alien and any weapon Duke has used). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm just wondering what Steam Link actually does and what kind of equipment I need to minimise lag. I don't really have much of a home network beyond a cheap router and a PC. What exactly are the requirements for a good Steam Link connection? It performance dependent on my router?

Also I'm assuming the Steam Controller will use bluetooth? The only thing I have tried in this regards with my PC is a DS4 control, which had huge input lag. What is most likely to cause this issue (so I can get whatever gear is needed for Steam Link's release)? The DS4 or my Bluetooth dongle? </TEXT>

* Access to all spells

	<TITLE> Gabe, the Trickster (celebrating Source 2) </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-03-09 02:52:58 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> **Gabe, the Trickster**
 
 **Lore**: Some shitty mage who got off on playing a lot of tricks on people. Eventually, while messing around with some magic to punk some fools he accidentally transported himself to a black void, where he encountered a glowing orb of light he came to know as "The Source", the beginning of all the universes. He tapped into a small portion of its power then bla bla bla he's fighting ancients.
 
-
 
 **Description**: Some wizard dude or whatever
 
-
 
 **Appearance**: See above
 
Role: [] (#support) Support
 
| | |
|----------|:---------:|
| [](#str) Strength | 21 + 1.4 |
| [](#agip) Agility | 14 + 1.5 |
| [](#int) **Intelligence** | **30 + 2.0** |
| Damage | Whatever |
| Move Speed | 310 |
| Attack Range | He's ranged bro |
 
-----------
 
**Q - Stat Shuffle**
 
| | |
|-|-|
| Ability | Target Unit |
| Affects | Ally or enemy Heroes |
 
 Shuffles the targets stats. If used on allies, a stat bonus is applied to all of the targets stats after the shuffle is complete.
 
**DURATION:** 8

**STAT BONUS:** 2/4/6/8

[](#mana) **MANA COST**: 95 / 105 / 115 / 125
 
[](#cd) **COOL DOWN**: 5 / 4 / 3 / 2
 
* For example, an enemy with 20s, 18a and 15i may wind up with 18s, 15a and 20i. However, an ally with those same stats will wind up with (assuming the skill is level 4) 26s, 23a and 28i. Depending on the difference between stats and the skills level, it could have a net positive affect on each stat if used on an ally. Low cooldown allows you to wreak havoc in a fight, although has short cast range.
 
-----------
 
**W - Break**
 
| | |
|-|-|
| Ability | Target Unit |
| Affects | Enemy hero |
 
 Breaks the fundamental connection between an enemies item and The Source, causing it to malfunction. Item is selected at random.

**DURATION:** 5/6/7/8
 
[](#mana) **MANA COST**: 120
 
[](#cd) **COOL DOWN**: 60 / 50 / 40 / 30
 
* An enemies malfunctioning item will be marked in his inventory. A malfunctioning item will continue to provide stat bonuses, but will not offer any other passive effects. Attempting to use the malfunctioning items active ability will result in a 50% chance of the active malfunctioning (doing nothing and going on cooldown), a 40% chance of it backfiring (varies from item to item. Abyssal Blade will cast on yourself, whereas BoTs will simply deal damage to you) and a 10% chance of functioning normally. 
 
-----------
 
**E - Block**
 
| | |
|-|-|
| Ability | Passive |
| Affects | N/A |
 
 Blocks random amounts of damage from each source of damage applied to Gabe. 
 
**BLOCK MIN:** 5% / 10% / 15% / 20%
**BLOCK MAX:** 10% / 20% / 30% / 50%
 
* It is NOT evasion, so it cannot bypassed with True Strike. Works pretty simply. After the final amount of damage is determined (after magic resistance, armour, other blocks, etc) the damage is reduced further by a random amount. For example, if Lina's ultimate would strike for 500 damage with this ability ignored, once the ability is taken into account (say, a level 3 Block) a random amount between 15% and 30% is blocked. In this case, say 20%. Only 400 damage will be dealt.
 
-----------
 
**R - Rewind**
 
| | |
|-|-|
| Ability | Active |
| Affects | Everyone and everything |
| Radius | Global |
 
 Turns back the course of events in the universe, returning everything to its original position several seconds earlier.
 
**TIME REWOUND:** 4 seconds

[](#mana) **MANA COST**: 100
 
[](#cd) **COOL DOWN**: 360 / 320 / 280
 
* This works as if rewinding the game in a replay. EVERYTHING goes back. If you used a BKB two seconds ago, and Gabe uses this ability, your BKB is back off cooldown, its time restored. All spells go back to whatever their cooldown was a few seconds ago. Etc. It's just like restoring a save state. It's a 'free undo' of a bad teamfight or an ally getting ganked. Nothing can prevent it or block it. </TEXT>

The scenario isn't important, but imagine an ultimatum type scenario. A decision must be made - and quickly (maybe a hostage situation with only enough time to save one, or they're drowning, idk). Saving one group will lead to the death of the other group, doing nothing leads to everyone dying. For whatever reason they have to work as a group, so they can't split up an attempt to help both. Also, all this information is known to everyone involved. It's one or the other. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Frieza was considered to be the most powerful being of his time, and was for quite some time. Then all of a sudden, in the course of a few years, we go from Frieza to God level enemies.

How can there be so many levels of Super Saiyan above basic Super Saiyan without them ever being achieved in history before?  It's like if after years of 100m runners shaving milliseconds of someone's records, all of a sudden someone comes along and sets a record at 5 seconds. Then some other guy comes along and does it in 4, then a third guy in three all over the course of a few weeks.

If Super Saiyan is so rare, why are so many cropping up in the decade (or whatever) that DBZ takes place?

Why is everyone suddenly so powerful? Where were these bad guys a few decades before Goku?

**TL;DR: Why is this point in history seeing a sudden power spike?** </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Scenario 1: Bruce Wayne is adopted by the [Nolastname's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characters_of_Malcolm_in_the_Middle#Main_characters) after his parents deaths.

He is a genetically gifted child with the ability to excel in anything he does, but has a very different temperament to Malcolm and the boys. Does he excel in this environment or wind up like Frances?

Scenario 2: He is the birth child of Lois and Hal, replacing Malcolm. Genetically the same as he was before, except now his parents never died. How does this impact his development? Remember the negative impact his older brothers will have on his behaviour.

But this is who would win!
