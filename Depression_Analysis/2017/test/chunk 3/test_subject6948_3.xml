	<TEXT> First off:

A. Talking Waddles will be amazing. 
B. Claymotion will be amazing. 
C. Jessie/Spider-Man crossover is literally the one thing Marvel fans feared would happen once Disney bought Marvel. ONE JOB. Putting the superheroes in a Disney cartoon is OK, but putting the Disney characters in the superhero cartoon? UGH.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If the only reference is the title, I'll be slightly disappointed. Little Shop was the last musical I performed in, and I loved it.

	<TEXT> Turns out a few other characters were announced a while back:

-Paper Mario. Paper Mario lacks range by himself, so summoning his partners will allow him to control the stage and combo with speed. 

-Lip. Her wand will drain health from enemies, so naturally her weaker attacks are powered up when you use them in tandem with her flower powers. Racking up damage has never been so satisfying. 

-Robotnik. This is a upgrade character. He can use his skills to repair his weaponry, allowing him to increase power, range and knockback. All of this disappears when he's KO'd, though. A good example is his recovery, the jetpack. It will blast farther and release more flames as it's upgraded. Think Engineer from TF2 and Lucas from PM combined. 

That's all I can reveal at the moment, but we're working furiously.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I love SSF2 and Crusade, both are awesome games. But I do notice things that they hit or miss on, and I want to kind of do my own thing that makes Affinity unique from other fan games or the console installments.  </TEXT>
