	<TEXT> I lived with an Asian family the first semester that I transferred to my university. It was weird, so I decided to join a club so I could branch out and meet new people. Turns out that after the first semester, one of my club-mates asked me to move into his 5 bedroom house. Life was good after that.

Then I joined a fraternity and made like a million more friends. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Kill Bill: Instead of a story of revenge, it a really sadistic story about a man stalking his ex lover, killing all of her friends and family in order to find her and kill her.

Sounds more like a horror film than a kung-fu movie. </TEXT>
