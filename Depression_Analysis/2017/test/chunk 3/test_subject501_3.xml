	<TEXT> Maybe I'm over-reacting a bit, and I normally take documentaries with a grain of sand, but this just really got to me. I just cannot believe what these bastards have gotten away with and how they treat their people. How they practically used people, such as Tom Cruise, to gain power and superiority. Also, how they basically destroyed his marriage to Nicole Kidman. Don't even get me started on that bastard Miscavige....

Like I said, how true can all this be? It seems pretty legit to me. I just wanted to see if anyone else feels the same way :) </TEXT>

I know that sound ridiculous and I probably will be downvoted but it's just how I feel. Don't get me wrong, I LOVED The Avengers, but throughout my life I wanted to see the characters that I grew up with put into a motion picture. Unfortunately, It just felt like an entertaining but shallow action film. I wanted more, I wanted a more 'cinematic' feel and look to it, and now I think that Joss Whedon has implemented this 'feel' into AoU, just judging by the 3 trailers. You get me

	<TEXT> One of my biggest gripes with the first Avengers is that is wasn't cinematic enough. To me, it just didn't have that feel. From what I've seen as far as trailers go, I think the film has a much more 'cinematic' vibe to it. I can't say for sure, as I have not seen it yet. I hope it does turn out to be like that, as I believe that's how superhero movies SHOULD feel. Anyone else feel the same way? I would love the discuss this further. :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Totally, talk to to me about anything. I used to play PC, my rig was soooo shit (i played on intel HD graphics). I played games like far cry 2 (one of my all time favs), skyrim, mark of the ninja, counter strike, the first assassins creed( again one of my favs). just games like that really, buuuuut i recently got a PS4, what an upgrade right? It's been great, i've just loaded up on games like gta 5, AC black flag, watch dogs and far cry 4. some of them are a little too disturbing for my taste (watch dogs) by i enjoyed all of them.

when you do finish work and go to the gamestore etc just have a think about the things we've been talking about previously, that should help a little.  </TEXT>

I never mentioned, i loved video games as well, feel free to talk to me about them. If your co workers are like that then yeah I do understand your situation, at least you have your cousin, family can be friends as well. Insurgent? not bad at all. summer (in america) is coming up so that's when all the awesome movies come out, like i cannot wait for Avengers age of ultron. 

If you don't mind, every few days i would like to PM you just to see how you are doing. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am so happy that this is getting you to think. Please tell me what you want to do after your shift. Dogs are great, I recommend you look into that.

As for your coworkers, I see the problem. I think you can still form friendships among them, even if your interests are different. You strike up small talk and just go from there. Are they friendly? I find that talking about recent news, world events etc works a lot of the time, as most people are interested in these things.

Most of all I think you need time to yourself. I mean like taking a day off work as I mentioned or doing alternative things after work like going to the park, beach etc these things can help more than you think; just some peaceful time for self reflection. If you do end up watching the films I recommended please tell me what you think of them and if they impacted/affected you in any way. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hmmmm yeah you really need to watch those movies I recommended. Fight Club changed me as a person, as did American Beauty, as both of the main characters in those films were just like me a few years ago and little bit like you too. If I changed, I believe you can too.

You said you have a full time job. Why not start looking for friends there? Or maybe a girlfriend. 

As for the drive home, eat dinner, bed at 10 thing, you really need to change that, as I can see that's part of what's dragging you down. Who told you that you HAVE to go to bed at 10? Who ever said you HAVE to go to work? Or even come home from work? Just take the day off one day, go to the park or beach or movies, just have a day to yourself. Pick a sunny, BEAUTIFUL day. Also, how about a pet? Dogs can be best, BEST friends. They can cheer you up, you can take them for walk, talk to them etc. You don't have to do the exact same crap everyday, no one ever said you did. We were put on this earth to live, you feel the emotions embedded in us, not be prisoners unto ourselves, and not to waste away our days. Is that how you want to remember your life? Doing the same things everyday? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I know exactly how you feel. 

I used to be like you.

I recommend you watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipe6CMvW0Dg)

I keep happy using these 3 principles:

**1. (The most important IMO) Lotsa good movies, books, music and T.v shows**

That's right. I mentally deteriorate if I don't get good entertainment. It's important to me, it is what I value. I try to go to the movies as often as possible and I collect blurays and try to watch a movie a day. I also listen to a wide variety of music. Good music, not shit. This includes Elton John, Pink Floyd, ELO, Queen, David Bowie etc. Good books do the job as well. I LOVE Stephen King and I LOVE batman comics. That's just me. It's things like this that make us human.

**2. FRIENDS!**

You NEED people to talk to, it is an absolute necessity. And remember, it's QUALITY not QUANTITY. I have a medium-ish circle of friends who I am all close to, and they love me and I love them! If you are having a shitty day then you can ALWAYS talk to a friend about it, they will always listen, and that can help more than you may think.

**3 AN ESTABLISHED WAY OF SEEING THE WORLD THAT ISN'T NEGATIVE**

You need to know where are are and what you are. That may sound stupid, but you need to embrace everything. You are a living organism. We were not created by a superhuman being or whatever, unfortunately we won't find out until the day we die. But until that day we need to LIVE. Don't waste away your time, you are a human being for christ sake!! MAKE YOUR MARK ON THIS EARTH, you will only live once!! You need to have your own way of seeing things that isn't overly pessimistic or optimistic. I am a little bit in between. Also, try not to worry to much. I know a few people who let things like world hunger, poverty, terrorist attacks etc get to them, and I can see how much it drags them down. Don't let that terrible stuff get in your way!!! The way I see it, it's all background noise, unless it comes to me, which it never does.

Anyway, enough about me. Tell me about you. I really do want to help you out, and I will try my best.

Also, watch the following films (they helped me):

American Beauty (1999)

Birdman (2014)

Fight Club (1999) 

Silver Linings Playbook (2012)

Hope this helped, please respond!!

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Personally, I enjoyed the first. The second? Not so much. To me the second volume was Von Trier's typical pessimistic style of film making and to a degree the first volume as well. But the ending to the 2nd volume really bothered me. As I stated before, It is a very pessimistic film. You are basically watching a character on a downward spiral, but the 2nd volume just went full Von Trier-hate the world mode, and I did not appreciate it.

Back to the first volume. Like I said, I genuinely enjoyed the first film. Although I would not watch it again, it was probably the most realistic you can get when covering that subject matter, and it didn't go over the top with it. Now you're probably think to yourself 'well, yes it did. Just look at the sex scenes!'. But the thing is, like I said, this is the most **realistic** take on this subject matter as you can get. And so while the graphic and sometimes unwatchable sex scenes are pretty intense, they are not over the top and gratuitous; they are simply realistic.

Anyway, that's my thoughts on the film. Please don't downvote! There is no need to as these are just my opinions. Yes I know my grammar is all over the place; I am not much of a writer.
I would love to here your thoughts on the films, like I said, please don't downvote if you disagree just post your argument in the comments and I will be happy to discuss :) </TEXT>
