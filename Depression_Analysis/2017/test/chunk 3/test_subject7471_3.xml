	<TEXT> I run a fun, small subreddit: /r/SummerScavengerHunt. Every year on June 1st we share a scavenger hunt list. Participants post photos and videos of themselves finding items or completing tasks from the scavenger hunt list (last year's list can be found in the sidebar) and then the moderators award points to your team if the submission meets the criteria (teams can be one or two people). 

Here are some of the items people submitted for last year's scavenger hunt:

[#89 A drink with a phallic name that isn't Bawls](http://i.imgur.com/Lnmg5mh.jpg)

[#142 Someone in a banana suit](http://i.imgur.com/3x3JG8Z.jpg)

[#165 A banknote with a denomination larger than 1,000,000](http://i.imgur.com/K5fmlLE.jpg)

[#202 Make a pair of ice skates by attaching ice to the bottom of your shoes.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaXsKrmg4io feature=youtu.be)

[#260 Feed an animal (besides a human) a carrot out of your mouth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_qerX9uuK0 feature=youtu.be)

It would be great to have some more participants this year, so please join in the competition! </TEXT>

An ethical person also isn't someone who just considers how their actions impact certain groups that they deem worthy. In order to be ethical you need to consider the impact your actions have on all others. There is no reason why that should only include humans. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> And unlike keto diets, vegan diets have support from mainstream dietary organizations and experts:

**[American Dietetic Association](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19562864)**

 It is the position of the American Dietetic Association that appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases. Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence, and for athletes.

**[Dietitians of Canada](http://www.dietitians.ca/Nutrition-Resources-A-Z/Factsheets/Vegetarian/Eating-Guidelines-for-Vegans.aspx)**

 A well planned vegan diet can meet all of these needs. It is safe and healthy for pregnant and breastfeeding women, babies, children, teens and seniors.

**[The British National Health Service](http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/Vegetarianhealth/Pages/Vegandiets.aspx)**

 With good planning and an understanding of what makes up a healthy, balanced vegan diet, you can get all the nutrients your body needs.

**[The British Nutrition Foundation](http://www.nutrition.org.uk/publications/briefingpapers/vegetarian-nutrition)**

 A well-planned, balanced vegetarian or vegan diet can be nutritionally adequate ... Studies of UK vegetarian and vegan children have revealed that their growth and development are within the normal range.

**[The Dietitians Association of Australia](http://daa.asn.au/for-the-public/smart-eating-for-you/nutrition-a-z/vegan-diets/)**

 Vegan diets are a type of vegetarian diet, where only plant-based foods are eaten. They differ to other vegetarian diets in that no animal products are usually consumed or used. Despite these restrictions, with good planning it is still possible to obtain all the nutrients required for good health on a vegan diet.

**[The United States Department of Agriculture](http://www.choosemyplate.gov/healthy-eating-tips/tips-for-vegetarian.html)**

 Vegetarian diets (*see context*) can meet all the recommendations for nutrients. The key is to consume a variety of foods and the right amount of foods to meet your calorie needs. Follow the food group recommendations for your age, sex, and activity level to get the right amount of food and the variety of foods needed for nutrient adequacy. Nutrients that vegetarians may need to focus on include protein, iron, calcium, zinc, and vitamin B12.

**[The National Health and Medical Research Council](http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/_files_nhmrc/publications/attachments/n55a_australian_dietary_guidelines_summary_130530.pdf)**

 Alternatives to animal foods include nuts, seeds, legumes, beans and tofu. For all Australians,
these foods increase dietary variety and can provide a valuable, affordable source of protein
and other nutrients found in meats. These foods are also particularly important for those who
follow vegetarian or vegan dietary patterns. Australians following a vegetarian diet can still meet nutrient requirements if energy needs are met and the appropriate number and variety of serves from the Five Food Groups are eaten throughout the day. For those eating a vegan diet, supplementation of B12 is recommended.

**[The Mayo Clinic](http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-living/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/vegetarian-diet/art-20046446)**

  A well-planned vegetarian diet (*see context*) can meet the needs of people of all ages, including children, teenagers, and pregnant or breast-feeding women. The key is to be aware of your nutritional needs so that you plan a diet that meets them.

**[The Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada](http://www.heartandstroke.com/site/c.ikIQLcMWJtE/b.3484249/k.2F6C/Healthy_living__Vegetarian_diets.htm)**

 Vegetarian diets (*see context*) can provide all the nutrients you need at any age, as well as some additional health benefits. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's unfortunate that your wife is struggling with anemia. Clearly her current meat heavy diet isn't sufficient to meet her needs. While taking iron supplements is probably a good start, there are many other factors that can increase or decrease iron absorption (for example consuming vitamin C with iron will increase absorption, while foods containing phytic acid will decrease absorption). There is no reason why she would have to rely upon meat as a superior source of iron. 

Finally, nobody is pushing anything upon you by simply writing something on the internet. Feminists aren't forcing their beliefs upon others when they say that women should receive equal pay for equal work or when they say all women should have the opportunity to receive a basic education. As Elie Wiesel famously wrote: 

We must take sides. Neutrality helps the oppressor, never the victim. Silence encourages the tormentor, never the tormented. Sometimes we must interfere.

The people who are pushing their beliefs on others are those who are forcing animals to live lives in terrible conditions of confinement and who force these animals to ultimately be slaughtered for their meals.   </TEXT>

That said, following the sort of diet you propose is still vastly outside of mainstream dietary advice (despite being perfectly possible as a vegan). 

The American Dietetic Association addresses Omega-3s in their position paper. I'm much more inclined to trust the world's most prominent dietetic organization on the subject (who also cites peer reviewed research to back up their position) than I am inclined to take your word on it. </TEXT>

**INGREDIENTS**

Mushrooms: 

* 2 portobello mushrooms, sliced
* 3 garlic cloves, minced
* 1 tbsp. olive oil
* 2 tbsp. balsamic vinegar
*  tsp. salt

Dough:

* 2 cups all-purpose flour
* 2 tsp. instant dry yeast
* 1 tsp. sugar
* 1 tsp. salt
*  cup warm water (105-115F)
* 2 tbsp. olive oil 

Guacamole:

* 3 large avocados, ripe (soft not squishy)
* 2 garlic cloves, minced
*  lime
* 1 small tomato, diced
*  red onion, diced
* Salt


**Instructions: ** 

Guacamole: 

1. Cut your avocados in half and remove pit. Spoon out avocado into a medium bowl. Add in garlic, salt, and freshly squeezed lime. Mash avocado until smooth. Add the tomatoes and onion, stirring until combined. Cover and refrigerator until chilled, probably a good hour. Give it a taste test to see if it needs more salt or lime.

Mushrooms:

1. Preheat oven to 425F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. Toss the portobellos in a large mixing bowl with the olive oil, salt, balsamic vinegar, and garlic. Mix gently until combined and all mushrooms are coated. Place onto baking sheet and cook for 15 minutes. Remove and set aside.

Crust:

1. Add the water and oil to the bowl of your stand mixer. In a separate bowl, sift together the flour, sugar, yeast, and salt. Attach the dough hook to your stand mixer and start the mixer on low. Carefully add the flour mixture to the wet mixture, increasing the speed of the mixer as needed. Mix until the dough forms a ball and clears the sides of the mixer.
2. Lightly flour your counter. Place the dough on top and knead until smooth and elastic, between 5-7 minutes. Lightly grease the bowl of your stand mixer and set the dough inside, rotating the bowl so the dough becomes coated in oil. Cover and set aside for 1 hour (or until dough has doubled in size.)
3. When ready to use, preheat oven to 475F. Deflate the dough by punching it and pouring onto your floured countertops. Roll out into a large size pizza crust and place onto your pizza pan. Brush dough with olive oil and bake for 10-12 minutes, or until golden brown and desired consistency is reached.

Pizza assembly:

1. Spread the guacamole across your COOKED pizza dough. Once smooth, top with the portobello mushrooms. Cut and serve! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Why are you going against the published statements of all these major dietetic organizations?

**[American Dietetic Association](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19562864)**

 It is the position of the American Dietetic Association that appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases. Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence, and for athletes.

**[Dietitians of Canada](http://www.dietitians.ca/Nutrition-Resources-A-Z/Factsheets/Vegetarian/Eating-Guidelines-for-Vegans.aspx)**

 A well planned vegan diet can meet all of these needs. It is safe and healthy for pregnant and breastfeeding women, babies, children, teens and seniors.

**[The British National Health Service](http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/Vegetarianhealth/Pages/Vegandiets.aspx)**

 With good planning and an understanding of what makes up a healthy, balanced vegan diet, you can get all the nutrients your body needs.

**[The British Nutrition Foundation](http://www.nutrition.org.uk/publications/briefingpapers/vegetarian-nutrition)**

 A well-planned, balanced vegetarian or vegan diet can be nutritionally adequate ... Studies of UK vegetarian and vegan children have revealed that their growth and development are within the normal range.

**[The Dietitians Association of Australia](http://daa.asn.au/for-the-public/smart-eating-for-you/nutrition-a-z/vegan-diets/)**

 Vegan diets are a type of vegetarian diet, where only plant-based foods are eaten. They differ to other vegetarian diets in that no animal products are usually consumed or used. Despite these restrictions, with good planning it is still possible to obtain all the nutrients required for good health on a vegan diet.

**[The United States Department of Agriculture](http://www.choosemyplate.gov/healthy-eating-tips/tips-for-vegetarian.html)**

 Vegetarian diets (*see context*) can meet all the recommendations for nutrients. The key is to consume a variety of foods and the right amount of foods to meet your calorie needs. Follow the food group recommendations for your age, sex, and activity level to get the right amount of food and the variety of foods needed for nutrient adequacy. Nutrients that vegetarians may need to focus on include protein, iron, calcium, zinc, and vitamin B12.

**[The National Health and Medical Research Council](http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/_files_nhmrc/publications/attachments/n55a_australian_dietary_guidelines_summary_130530.pdf)**

 Alternatives to animal foods include nuts, seeds, legumes, beans and tofu. For all Australians,
these foods increase dietary variety and can provide a valuable, affordable source of protein
and other nutrients found in meats. These foods are also particularly important for those who
follow vegetarian or vegan dietary patterns. Australians following a vegetarian diet can still meet nutrient requirements if energy needs are met and the appropriate number and variety of serves from the Five Food Groups are eaten throughout the day. For those eating a vegan diet, supplementation of B12 is recommended.

**[The Mayo Clinic](http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-living/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/vegetarian-diet/art-20046446)**

  A well-planned vegetarian diet (*see context*) can meet the needs of people of all ages, including children, teenagers, and pregnant or breast-feeding women. The key is to be aware of your nutritional needs so that you plan a diet that meets them.

**[The Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada](http://www.heartandstroke.com/site/c.ikIQLcMWJtE/b.3484249/k.2F6C/Healthy_living__Vegetarian_diets.htm)**

 Vegetarian diets (*see context*) can provide all the nutrients you need at any age, as well as some additional health benefits. </TEXT>

I am familiar with the sensational news stories that get published every time a new piece of research comes out about plants reacting to stimuli.

	<TEXT> Note: I did not write this. A friend of mine who works for the Humane League shared this.

I went vegan after receiving a leaflet on the horrors of the animal industry. This was handed to me four years ago, when I visited my cousin's college. I would like to pay this forward now by taking a more active role in animal advocacy at my university. I recently realized that to be the best vegan I can, I have to change not just myself, but influence others as well. With The Humane League's resources and support, I will enthusiastically work to increase people's knowledge on the environmental and ethical problems of animal farming, and hopefully spur them to action--and to veganism! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There are plenty of people who give up on their vegetarianism, and hopefully seeing a reminder of why being vegetarian is so important will encourage people to maintain their vegetarianism. Furthermore, simply being vegetarian isn't everything that we can be doing to help these animals. We can donate to animal rights groups, get involved in animal rights activism, cut dairy and eggs out of our diets, and much more. Hopefully people here who already care about these issues will do more to help after seeing just how tragic videos like this are, not just for this one cow, but for millions of other similar cows. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have been vegan for the past 7 years. Ultimately ethical veganism is a boycott intended to lessen the demand for animal products. Other animals do not possess all of the capacities that a typical human would have, but they show responses that appear quite similar to our own reactions to suffering when treated in many of the ways that would cause us to suffer.

[Utilitarianism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilitarianism) is a common school of ethical thought amongst vegans. Utilitarians view an action as good if it maximizes the amount of goodness (generally judged as increasing pleasure or happiness, and minimizing pain or suffering) that is expected to occur as a result. While many ethical vegans will openly admit that they enjoy the taste of meat (evidenced by the numerous meat alternatives available for vegans today), they recognize that the harm caused to other animals to produce these products almost certainly exceeds the pleasure they gain as a result. The boycott that is veganism lessens demand for these products, and correspondingly supply will decrease as a result.

Another way of expressing this is in the principle of [equal consideration of interests](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_consideration_of_interests). That is to say that the interest of any individual should be given equal consideration where, and to the extent that the interest exists. This isn't to say that all interests are equal, experienced equally, or that all animals possess interests, but that where there are interests, we should weight that interest proportionally to the intensity of the interest and not discriminate on any other basis. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am interested in interning with The Humane League because I was recently exposed to issues of farm animal cruelty when someone was handing out leaflets on my college campus. The leaflets included information about the abuse farm animals suffer and a quote about how it's odd that we cuddle some animals (our pets) but stick forks in others (farm animals). I have always been an animal lover and have been trying to become vegetarian for years, but this really hit home with me and I have become vegetarian. I think that spreading awareness about animal cruelty is the most efficient way to get people to understand it, as many people are unaware of the cruelty that occurs. I would love to be part of an organization that works to fight against this. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There is overwhelming consensus that humans can be healthy on vegan diets. Once again, who cares if it is "natural" or not?

**[American Dietetic Association](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19562864)**

 It is the position of the American Dietetic Association that appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases. Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence, and for athletes.

**[Dietitians of Canada](http://www.dietitians.ca/Nutrition-Resources-A-Z/Factsheets/Vegetarian/Eating-Guidelines-for-Vegans.aspx)**

 A well planned vegan diet can meet all of these needs. It is safe and healthy for pregnant and breastfeeding women, babies, children, teens and seniors.

**[The British National Health Service](http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/Vegetarianhealth/Pages/Vegandiets.aspx)**

 With good planning and an understanding of what makes up a healthy, balanced vegan diet, you can get all the nutrients your body needs.

**[The British Nutrition Foundation](http://www.nutrition.org.uk/publications/briefingpapers/vegetarian-nutrition)**

 A well-planned, balanced vegetarian or vegan diet can be nutritionally adequate ... Studies of UK vegetarian and vegan children have revealed that their growth and development are within the normal range.

**[The Dietitians Association of Australia](http://daa.asn.au/for-the-public/smart-eating-for-you/nutrition-a-z/vegan-diets/)**

 Vegan diets are a type of vegetarian diet, where only plant-based foods are eaten. They differ to other vegetarian diets in that no animal products are usually consumed or used. Despite these restrictions, with good planning it is still possible to obtain all the nutrients required for good health on a vegan diet.

**[The United States Department of Agriculture](http://www.choosemyplate.gov/healthy-eating-tips/tips-for-vegetarian.html)**

 Vegetarian diets (*see context*) can meet all the recommendations for nutrients. The key is to consume a variety of foods and the right amount of foods to meet your calorie needs. Follow the food group recommendations for your age, sex, and activity level to get the right amount of food and the variety of foods needed for nutrient adequacy. Nutrients that vegetarians may need to focus on include protein, iron, calcium, zinc, and vitamin B12.

**[The National Health and Medical Research Council](http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/_files_nhmrc/publications/attachments/n55a_australian_dietary_guidelines_summary_130530.pdf)**

 Alternatives to animal foods include nuts, seeds, legumes, beans and tofu. For all Australians,
these foods increase dietary variety and can provide a valuable, affordable source of protein
and other nutrients found in meats. These foods are also particularly important for those who
follow vegetarian or vegan dietary patterns. Australians following a vegetarian diet can still meet nutrient requirements if energy needs are met and the appropriate number and variety of serves from the Five Food Groups are eaten throughout the day. For those eating a vegan diet, supplementation of B12 is recommended.

**[The Mayo Clinic](http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-living/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/vegetarian-diet/art-20046446)**

  A well-planned vegetarian diet (*see context*) can meet the needs of people of all ages, including children, teenagers, and pregnant or breast-feeding women. The key is to be aware of your nutritional needs so that you plan a diet that meets them.

**[The Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada](http://www.heartandstroke.com/site/c.ikIQLcMWJtE/b.3484249/k.2F6C/Healthy_living__Vegetarian_diets.htm)**

 Vegetarian diets (*see context*) can provide all the nutrients you need at any age, as well as some additional health benefits. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We also don't commonly live to 80 years old in nature. We all benefit greatly from fortified foods like iodized salt, enriched flour, and fortified cereals. It is also recommended that [all pregnant women take a folic acid supplement](http://www.webmd.com/baby/folic-acid-and-pregnancy). We can, and already are doing things much better than nature thanks to supplements and fortified foods, and many other unnatural aspects of modern life.

On the other hand, humans have engaged in tribal violence for all of recorded history and we even see signs of it among other great apes, so war and violence seem very natural, but I think we would both agree that they are not good.

Simply stating whether or not something is natural tells us nothing about whether we ought to continue doing it going forward. </TEXT>

B12 is a vitamin, not a protein. It is produced by bacteria. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I run a fun, small subreddit: /r/SummerScavengerHunt. Every year on June 1st we share a scavenger hunt list. Participants post photos and videos of themselves finding items or completing tasks from the scavenger hunt list and then the moderators award points to your team if the submission meets the criteria (teams can be one or two people). 

Here are some of the items people submitted for last year's scavenger hunt:

[#89 A drink with a phallic name that isn't Bawls](http://i.imgur.com/Lnmg5mh.jpg)

[#142 Someone in a banana suit](http://i.imgur.com/3x3JG8Z.jpg)

[#165 A banknote with a denomination larger than 1,000,000](http://i.imgur.com/K5fmlLE.jpg)

[#202 Make a pair of ice skates by attaching ice to the bottom of your shoes.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaXsKrmg4io feature=youtu.be)

[#260 Feed an animal (besides a human) a carrot out of your mouth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_qerX9uuK0 feature=youtu.be)

It would be great to have some more participants this year, so please subscribe and join in the competition! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In circumstances where no harm is caused to animals to produce an animal product then I have no ethical issue with using it. You will find this is frequently repeated position amongst vegans. For example, [here is an article about how it is ethical for vegans to eat oysters](http://sentientist.org/2013/05/20/the-ethical-case-for-eating-oysters-and-mussels/) (you can find several more articles along these lines with a Google search), and [here you can find an essay from Ingrid Newkirk about how she is excited to eat lab grown meat](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/04/20/magazine/ethics-eating-meat.html?_r=0).

I think with a little research you will quickly see that cruelty is still inherent in any commercial production of wool and eggs. I would say we don't understand the experiences of bees very well, but it is quite plausible given our current understanding that they suffer greatly as well. 

Finally, meat isn't going to be abolished tomorrow. Hopefully, demand for meat will decline down the road and fewer animals will be bred into existence to meet the lower demand. There are still wild or feral chickens, boars, and cattle living in several parts of the world, so their existence will continue. If down the road there comes a time when a majority of our society wishes to abolish meat then we can decide whether to outlaw the breeding of new farmed animals and allow the others to still be slaughtered or if we desire to invest in providing safe living conditions for the farm animals who are alive at that time to safely live out their lives. Stopping the mistreatment of animals for human consumption is not an insurmountable hurdle. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This really just goes to show your lack of understanding of why people choose to be vegan. While buying organic is completely unrelated to being vegan we are well aware that manure is often used as a fertilizer. 

Being vegan isn't about some dogmatic avoidance of any product with some arbitrary connection that can be drawn to some animal product. The Vegan Society (which coined the term "vegan") defines veganism as:

Veganism is a way of living that seeks to exclude, as far as possible and practicable, all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing and any other purpose.

Veganism is about minimizing the harm we cause to others, which is a cause that most sensible people would get behind. </TEXT>

**[American Dietetic Association](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19562864)**

 It is the position of the American Dietetic Association that appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases. Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence, and for athletes.

**[Dietitians of Canada](http://www.dietitians.ca/Nutrition-Resources-A-Z/Factsheets/Vegetarian/Eating-Guidelines-for-Vegans.aspx)**

 A well planned vegan diet can meet all of these needs. It is safe and healthy for pregnant and breastfeeding women, babies, children, teens and seniors.

**[The British National Health Service](http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/Vegetarianhealth/Pages/Vegandiets.aspx)**

 With good planning and an understanding of what makes up a healthy, balanced vegan diet, you can get all the nutrients your body needs.

**[The British Nutrition Foundation](http://www.nutrition.org.uk/publications/briefingpapers/vegetarian-nutrition)**

 A well-planned, balanced vegetarian or vegan diet can be nutritionally adequate ... Studies of UK vegetarian and vegan children have revealed that their growth and development are within the normal range.

**[The Dietitians Association of Australia](http://daa.asn.au/for-the-public/smart-eating-for-you/nutrition-a-z/vegan-diets/)**

 Vegan diets are a type of vegetarian diet, where only plant-based foods are eaten. They differ to other vegetarian diets in that no animal products are usually consumed or used. Despite these restrictions, with good planning it is still possible to obtain all the nutrients required for good health on a vegan diet.

**[The United States Department of Agriculture](http://www.choosemyplate.gov/healthy-eating-tips/tips-for-vegetarian.html)**

 Vegetarian diets (*see context*) can meet all the recommendations for nutrients. The key is to consume a variety of foods and the right amount of foods to meet your calorie needs. Follow the food group recommendations for your age, sex, and activity level to get the right amount of food and the variety of foods needed for nutrient adequacy. Nutrients that vegetarians may need to focus on include protein, iron, calcium, zinc, and vitamin B12.

**[The National Health and Medical Research Council](http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/_files_nhmrc/publications/attachments/n55a_australian_dietary_guidelines_summary_130530.pdf)**

 Alternatives to animal foods include nuts, seeds, legumes, beans and tofu. For all Australians,
these foods increase dietary variety and can provide a valuable, affordable source of protein
and other nutrients found in meats. These foods are also particularly important for those who
follow vegetarian or vegan dietary patterns. Australians following a vegetarian diet can still meet nutrient requirements if energy needs are met and the appropriate number and variety of serves from the Five Food Groups are eaten throughout the day. For those eating a vegan diet, supplementation of B12 is recommended.

**[The Mayo Clinic](http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-living/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/vegetarian-diet/art-20046446)**

  A well-planned vegetarian diet (*see context*) can meet the needs of people of all ages, including children, teenagers, and pregnant or breast-feeding women. The key is to be aware of your nutritional needs so that you plan a diet that meets them.

**[The Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada](http://www.heartandstroke.com/site/c.ikIQLcMWJtE/b.3484249/k.2F6C/Healthy_living__Vegetarian_diets.htm)**

 Vegetarian diets (*see context*) can provide all the nutrients you need at any age, as well as some additional health benefits. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am not arguing that people don't enjoy the taste or convenience of animal products, but the point was made that they are "needed", which is false. 

People are a lot less sympathetic to those who say, "I kill animals because I enjoy it." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You can also get nutrition by eating human flesh. That doesn't mean you need to eat human flesh to get nutrition. There is strong scientific consensus that you also do not need any meat to have a healthy diet.

**[American Dietetic Association](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19562864)**

 It is the position of the American Dietetic Association that appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases. Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence, and for athletes.

**[Dietitians of Canada](http://www.dietitians.ca/Nutrition-Resources-A-Z/Factsheets/Vegetarian/Eating-Guidelines-for-Vegans.aspx)**

 A well planned vegan diet can meet all of these needs. It is safe and healthy for pregnant and breastfeeding women, babies, children, teens and seniors.

**[The British National Health Service](http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/Vegetarianhealth/Pages/Vegandiets.aspx)**

 With good planning and an understanding of what makes up a healthy, balanced vegan diet, you can get all the nutrients your body needs.

**[The British Nutrition Foundation](http://www.nutrition.org.uk/publications/briefingpapers/vegetarian-nutrition)**

 A well-planned, balanced vegetarian or vegan diet can be nutritionally adequate ... Studies of UK vegetarian and vegan children have revealed that their growth and development are within the normal range.

**[The Dietitians Association of Australia](http://daa.asn.au/for-the-public/smart-eating-for-you/nutrition-a-z/vegan-diets/)**

 Vegan diets are a type of vegetarian diet, where only plant-based foods are eaten. They differ to other vegetarian diets in that no animal products are usually consumed or used. Despite these restrictions, with good planning it is still possible to obtain all the nutrients required for good health on a vegan diet.

**[The United States Department of Agriculture](http://www.choosemyplate.gov/healthy-eating-tips/tips-for-vegetarian.html)**

 Vegetarian diets (*see context*) can meet all the recommendations for nutrients. The key is to consume a variety of foods and the right amount of foods to meet your calorie needs. Follow the food group recommendations for your age, sex, and activity level to get the right amount of food and the variety of foods needed for nutrient adequacy. Nutrients that vegetarians may need to focus on include protein, iron, calcium, zinc, and vitamin B12.

**[The National Health and Medical Research Council](http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/_files_nhmrc/publications/attachments/n55a_australian_dietary_guidelines_summary_130530.pdf)**

 Alternatives to animal foods include nuts, seeds, legumes, beans and tofu. For all Australians,
these foods increase dietary variety and can provide a valuable, affordable source of protein
and other nutrients found in meats. These foods are also particularly important for those who
follow vegetarian or vegan dietary patterns. Australians following a vegetarian diet can still meet nutrient requirements if energy needs are met and the appropriate number and variety of serves from the Five Food Groups are eaten throughout the day. For those eating a vegan diet, supplementation of B12 is recommended.

**[The Mayo Clinic](http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-living/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/vegetarian-diet/art-20046446)**

  A well-planned vegetarian diet (*see context*) can meet the needs of people of all ages, including children, teenagers, and pregnant or breast-feeding women. The key is to be aware of your nutritional needs so that you plan a diet that meets them.

**[The Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada](http://www.heartandstroke.com/site/c.ikIQLcMWJtE/b.3484249/k.2F6C/Healthy_living__Vegetarian_diets.htm)**

 Vegetarian diets (*see context*) can provide all the nutrients you need at any age, as well as some additional health benefits. </TEXT>
