	<TEXT> I have it built, do you think it would be worth it to set up a server for it? Maybe I should message the subreddit mods and see if they approve of it running 24/7 for this subreddit. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> D'oh, street view would be from a while ago .

I believe that the reference to Florida was just a story. That story was the one part of it that seemed too forced/fake.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Don't we all need a little ego-boosting from time to time? ;) 
I can't really think of when it would be used either, but it'll be there if people want it.

(Also, I'm almost done now, so too late!) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm trying to play around with reddit's API, and I got a neat idea for a bot. a gameMe/hlstats bot that pulls your stats for a specific server and posts them as a comment. e.x.

test_subject3547: "!gameMe someServerName"
gameMeBot: "Pos: 9001 Points: 0"

You would associate your steam and reddit accounts with the bot by sending it a PM like "associate STEAM_0:XXXXXXXX"

Any interest/suggestions? I would probably make it search through this subreddit, /r/gaming, maybe /r/steam and any other subreddits for games tracked by gameMe.

Edit: I've got a prototype working, just working on customizing which server to pull stats from. </TEXT>
