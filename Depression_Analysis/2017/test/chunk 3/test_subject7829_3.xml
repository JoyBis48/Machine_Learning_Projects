	<TEXT> It also doesn't take into account the issue of land-values, on which productivity has no effect.

Productivity does affect land value. For example, after the invention of the elevator and modern building techniques, the value of land in or near a city increased dramatically due to the fact you can fit more people and/or make more products with the same amount of land than you could previously.

Likewise, the Internet and telepresence technology has affected land value, but in the opposite direction (reducing demand) </TEXT>

As other posters mentioned, this is really a non-issue: Murray's own data shows economic status was the determining variable, not race, even if we admit "race" as a coherent, measurable concept, which I and most scientists have serious doubts about anyway. Remember there was a time when Italians and Jews were not considered "white," and now they are. </TEXT>

He did note that he focused exclusively on whites to avoid "ethnic issues." But the fact that this guy's book is called "The State of White America" raises the creepy level in the room just a bit. If this is the same Charles Murray who wrote "The Bell Curve," which suggested that blacks "naturally" have an IQ level 15 points below whites, it all starts to fit together. He's not worried about blacks because he thinks they're beyond hope anyway. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In terms of pure math, you are correct, but when the general public hears the words "strongly correlated," that's not what they think. It is possible, after all to have some form of cancer be "strongly correlated" with weight, and yet have it that a 160 lb. person has a 2.1% chance of the cancer whereas a 250 lb. person has a 2.2% chance of the cancer. In cases like these unit invariance is irrelevant - reporting such a link as "strongly correlated" is misleading, even though technically accurate. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's a convention, not a theorem. It's been chosen like that because it's useful.

No, that is not correct, it is in the structure of the idea of the factorial. Think of a baseball team of x players. There are x! ways for the coach to order them on a bench for photo. Now imagine if the coach simply wanted a picture of the empty bench (0 players.) There is only one way to order that photo. Therefore 0!=1

A similar argument can be made for the "inevitability" of such seemingly "hacky" definitions such as a^0 = 1. </TEXT>

You merely have to distinguish between declarable and constructable entities. For example, I can *declare* "a square circle" by saying these words, but I could never actually construct one.

Similarly, in Set Theory we can say "The set of all sets," but it is not clear if we mean declarable or constructable sets. The set of all declarable sets includes some sets which trigger Russel's Paradox, and thus are not constructable.

When a mathematician is saying "all sets this, all sets that," he is most likely referring to the set of all *constructable* sets.  </TEXT>

Empty of *inherent* selfhood does not mean total emptiness of being, but rather than our selves are unavoidably dependent on the existence of other beings (dependent origination.)

Right and left are labels given by American propagandists in the McCarthy era.

No, they come from where the factions sat in the French National Assembly after the Revolution.

His mistake was making his country a socialist dictatorship (communism), rather than a socialist republic.

I don't think he had a choice once he seized power. The majority of the Russian people in 1917 were rural and religious. They would not have voted for Bolshevism if given the chance. A Tolstoy-style religious socialism might have had a better shot. </TEXT>

Yes, I like how people do not get that social programs are actually a phenomenon of capitalism. There is no welfare in Socialism because everyone is guaranteed a job (and compelled to work.) 

I'm not saying that's a *good* thing, but welfare is Capitalism *preserving* itself from a possible Socialist uprising.

One of Lenin's slogans was "He who does not work, does not eat." Makes him sound like a Tea Party guy, which he was in some strange way, that way the far left and the far right always seem to converge.

By and large though, Hinduism is an inherited tradition. You can't just go sign up to become Hindu like you can for some other religions. The "Western Hindu" groups like the Hare Krishnas and the Rajneeshis are considered fake, heretical or just plain laughable by (most) actual Hindus. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Assuming "The West" means the current hegemonic system lead by the United States, I would advise you to beware the "rhetoric of decline" which is used for political manipulation and doesn't really represent the underlying reality. The US is still the world's largest manufacturer, food exporter and its military technology is light-years ahead of anyone else's.

Unfortunately a number of commenters here have bought in to this rhetoric full-scale. For example, one stated:

china and other nations find themselves with a young strong backbone 

China does not have a young, strong backbone. They overshot their population decades ago, experienced apocalyptic levels of starvation several times, and are still paying the price. Their demographics are completely upside down now and the very old will soon outnumber those of working age.

I wouldn't be surprised if the US, Latin America and India form the power troika of 40 years hence while China, Japan and Europe all suffer greatly just from demographic pressure alone. 

The US will probably no longer be the lone superpower c. 2050 but it's quite possible it will still be one of the top dogs.  </TEXT>

There was a case in a town near ours of a guy high on "bath salts" who tunneled into his neighbor's basement trying to kill him because he thought the guy was having sex with his wife. He had been a longtime marijuana user with no criminal record beyond possession and no history of mental illness.

Part of the problem with "bath salts" is they can be many different chemicals - you don't know what you're getting. I agree with a previous poster who said if marijuana was legal none of this would be happening, because most often this stuff is advertized as "legal pot" and sold in skate shops, head shops, etc. which pot users frequent. </TEXT>

Good post, but I'd disagree with you there. Many Socialists believe there is a basic unchangeable human nature, for example Marx's idea of "primitive Communism" representing the original state of Man that will eventually reappear in the final state.

In this view Capitalism is the temporary, un-natural aberration which is part of the reason why it will collapse. </TEXT>

Are you sure? I thought that was true in my state as well until a state senator told me otherwise. I was pretty shocked that my taxes pay to bus, heat and equip religious schools.

Have coaches teach gym class. 

They usually do, but they get a separate salary for coaching, at least in most districts in my area.

Require any part of the uniform that isn't customized to be returned at the end of the year (specifically, pants).

Haha, do you know what football uniforms look like by the end of the season? Usually there are multiple uniforms per player for each season because they rip and wear out.

private schools either learn to manage their finances REALLY well, or they disappear because they can't pay the bills.

Or they get the public to foot the bill for them, without any public oversight or standardized test "accountability" that public schools have to follow. Where I live, even some public schools are run by for-profit companies and are exempt from most state regulations, including the obligation to educate special-needs and learning-disabled students.

You've answered your own question. Racial identity anxiety is known to be linked with increased racism. See the American South with its rampant underground "miscegenation" during the pre-Civil War period for another example.

Niall Ferguson covers this issue in [The War of the World](http://www.amazon.com/War-World-Twentieth-Century-Conflict-Descent/dp/1594201005) - the book can be a bit dry but the section on racial anxiety is well worth reading. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Actually, public districts are required by law (at least in my state) to bus private students as well, and even pay for the textbooks and heating costs of private schools (except for religious textbooks.)

Sports cost more than you think - coaches are paid in most districts, uniforms, league fees and transportation are expensive, as is insurance, and "the field" in sports-crazy towns is often more like a minor-league stadium. Then there's the marching band - I know for a fact a large district near me has a marching band budget of nearly $100,000 per year.

Disputes over grades and discipline should be handled by the teacher and the student's family, and maybe the school authorities if necessary. When it comes to grade disputes, parents should be required to provide evidence that their student did not earn the grade received or that the assignment was graded unfairly.

Here I agree with you, but that's not the reality of how things work these days.

Administration, sports, legal costs (districts are sued constantly when they dare to actually fail or discipline kids), busing costs (no public transportation in most areas means districts maintain huge bus fleets of their own), physical plant (there are a lot of $100M-plus HS buildings in the US with terrible academics). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was surprised to read that there is no smell or taste in dreams because that part of the brain is shut off during REM sleep. But come to think of it, I've never experienced smell or taste in a dream.

If this is legit, it could be a very effective way to check to see if you're dreaming. So my question is - has anyone experienced smell or taste in dreams?

I'm headed to bed to test the theory myself...

**UPDATE:** Didn't work. I ate a whole box of chocolates, and I thought I was tasting them, although, upon awakening, I couldn't recall the taste. So, maybe there is no taste in dreams, but if you *think* you're tasting anyway, it's useless as a reality check. </TEXT>
