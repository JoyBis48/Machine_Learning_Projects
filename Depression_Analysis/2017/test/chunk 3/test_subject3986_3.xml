	<TEXT> the glamoflauge Lite comes in na double ended crayon, so i apply the lighter concealer first and then the darker/peachier shade to conceal even more. i then blend the corners with a blending sponge, but i find that my problem area (dark circles) arent concealed as well as i had hoped </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not sure its a joke... She was pretty instagram famous (~4k followers) but half of then were haters telling her that her brows looked terrible. So now she's going "all natural" and combing her brow hairs upwards so they look all furry. I dont think she understands that her new trend isn't helping her... </TEXT>

	<TITLE> HC Glamoflauge... am i doing it wrong? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> I decided to cave in and buy Hard Candy's Glamoflauge Lite concealer because i ran out of IT cosmetics bye-bye under eye. I tried it out today and i saw no visible change for my extremely dark circles under my eyes. I read up on MUA that it would work better if i applied above my foundation, but i wear powder so i dont know if that will work... Does anyone have any suggestions on how to get the best coverage out of Glamoflauge? Because i really want it to work!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have been dying to get my hands on the Limecrime Venus palette, and I even signed up for email alerts for when its back in stock...m but I cant justify buying a $50 eye shadow when I could probably find dupes for $20. Its the packaging that makes mw want it :( </TEXT>
