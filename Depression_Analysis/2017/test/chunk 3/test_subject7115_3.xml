	<TEXT> It was nice most of the time. We'd get into little fights but we got over them quickly and everything was good. And being big and not getting guys that often, I have to go for guys that fetishize fat guys. Sometimes it gets creepy. I don't want someone who wants me because I'm a big guy and that's what they like, all those people do enable guys like me to get bigger. I'm trying to shrink, not grow. I want someone who is going to support me in weight loss. I would talk to my ex about it and I asked what would you do if I lost weight and it was a considerable an he literally said he wouldn't be with me anymore. I need to get away from the fetish. But sadly, it probably won't happen. I have to get skinnier before I can find that.  </TEXT>

It's hard work but I'm trying. He brought me up and then when he said he didn't love me anymore and broke up with me over the phone, it destroyed my confidence. </TEXT>
