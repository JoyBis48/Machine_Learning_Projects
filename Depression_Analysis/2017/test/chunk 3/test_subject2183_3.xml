	<TEXT>  Buddhism is just another form of escapism

I've been reading a lot of nietzsche and nietzsche seems to be focused on the life affirming, endure through suffering type lifestyle while buddhism seems like an unconvincing idea of escapism, quick fixes, harmony or bliss.

Some would argue and say that buddhism is about wisdom and a peace mind, a peace mind will lead to better coping with life but i doubt that a peace mind is exclusive to buddhism i think learning to live with life as it is much like how nietzsche describes will leave you better off in the long run. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> He seems to be focused on escaping reality and living in some type of artificial bliss. I would say an opposite perspective would be that of Nietzsche, a life affirming idea where people acknowledge the reality they life in no matter how unpleasant and try to live with it, try to adapt to it and overcome it, rather than escaping with your meditation, your lsd or ecstacy or even your quick fixes like instant bliss. One should get up off their ass take life by the fucking neck and be the master and not the slave. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  I don't think they could have invaded the west coast. Midway would not have been the first big battle, Hawaii would have. From there it would have gone on much as it did, but at a later date. Lets say everything was delayed by a year, that we had not reduced them as much to ruins by the time the atomic bomb came into play. We had Tinian a year before we dropped the bomb- they would have been dropped on Japan on the same day as it already happened, and the war would have soon ended.
It may be that this would have drawn more of our resources from the European theater, in which case the Soviets would have ended up with more of Europe at the end. They could have beat Germany by themselves, assuming that lend-lease went on the same in the new history. </TEXT>

You: ok if you have a boner and you feel horny a few things you can do to help yourself have self control

You: make sure you are not hungry tired moody or thirsty

You: so hydrate yourself

You: use muscles a bit so that the blood goes from your penis elsewhere

You: a horny flaccid penis doesn't do much

You: and finally will power, consciously one can control everything they do, they just rationalize actions and some of them become automatic, so focus and try and control yourself, a burning monk during a protest didn't move a muscle or make a sound that's how much self control he had

You: so just remember your prefrontal cortex makes the decisions

You: the limbic system gives suggestions

You: you got anything to add to that plan?

You: how do you deal with those situations

You: rather than waiting it out specifically how do you take conscious control?

You: in detail

Stranger: well usually when I get erect I try to focus on other things or preoccupy myself, or if I start stroking my penis I'll force myself to put my hands at my sides. Also sometimes if I'm very horny and can't help it I'll play with my testicles, but not orgasm.

You: i try to re-wire my neurons, so if I am horny I would intuitively tell myself find a girl then

You: so eventually if you get really horny you will be good with women because you are so hungry for it

You: so every time you get horny ask, "how can I plan things so that I can increase my chances of finding women?

You: and if you happen to be around them and you are not feeling horny then you can say to yourself again intuitively -you had a chance-



You: the body will eventually re-wire itself to the real stuff

You: that goes for fetishes as well treat fetishes as you would treat horny urges

Stranger: good idea!

Stranger: it's just tough because I have a big cock too </TEXT>

So the rule goes

Have sex

Ejaculate with orgasm

Loop

	<DATE> 2013-12-19 03:08:55 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> My attempt is to try low stimulation activities, these include staring at a wall and doing nothing, walking while doing nothing or reading a book like nietzsche, our lives are full of overly stimulating activities like music, movies, games, porn the idea is to challenge the brain to live with normal to low stimulation, the brain should get "hungry" for stimulation and also your creative side will wake up even more. The mechanics for one activity goes:

Walk

thought enters head

time is precious, is this thought even worth thinking about, this thought is probably a rationalization or weakness is it?

next thought comes in "an urge to play a game", is there a good reason to play that game? no

another thought "is this worth precious human seconds?" probably not

eventually the boredom will fuel the brain for neuroplasticity and creativity for self improvement
thoughts guys? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My attempt is to try low stimulation activities, these include staring at a wall and doing nothing, walking while doing nothing or reading a book like nietzsche, our lives are full of overly stimulating activities like music, movies, games, porn the idea is to challenge the brain to live with normal to low stimulation, the brain should get "hungry" for stimulation and also your creative side will wake up even more. The mechanics for one activity goes:

Walk

 thought enters head

time is precious, is this thought even worth thinking about, this thought is probably a rationalization or weakness is it?

 next thought comes in "an urge to play a game", is there a good reason to play that game? no

 another thought "is this worth precious human seconds?" probably not

eventually the boredom will fuel the brain for neuroplasticity and creativity for self improvement

thoughts guys? </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Every time you get an erection in your underwear, the tight underwear restricts blood flow causing the brain to stop encouraging an erection and do the reverse, make it flaccid again. Over time this becomes habitual to the point where erections are less inclined to happen because they only go about 50% or never reach their peak
