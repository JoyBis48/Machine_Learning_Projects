	<TEXT> *The Brief History of Time* by Stephen Hawking - fits your specs of scientific non-fiction.. That being said, there are great books in non-ficiton domain. Try exploring books that are outside the apparent science genre because when you look keenly, everything has science at its heart. 

Books by :

* Malcolm Gladwell, Nassim Nicholas Taleb (fall under Social Science)
* Michael Lewis, Tim Harford  ( fall under Financial Science)

are very insightful.

And then:

* Isaac Asimov (if you ever find any non-ficiton book by this person, devour it without second thought, he's that good.)
* try reading biographies of remarkable people.. I loved Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson
* Walden by Henry David Thoreau   Into The Wild by Jon Krakauer
* A must read novel: *Flatland* by Edwin A. Abbot
* The Flipside by Adam J. Jackson

These are some of my recommendations for now, just to make you get used to reading interesting stuff.. and once you do that you will automatically start finding books on your own! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I experience this whenever I stay away from reading for more than a couple of days. Something seems missing in my daily life when I do that. And this quote seemed very appropriate for this sub where *reading* is a part of our lives... So I just thought we should see this.

EDIT: This post made some people feel like we are looking down upon non-readers.. No. We are not.. And this quote doesn't share even the least bit of such intentions. *Reading is about knowledge, but it is no real knowledge if it doesn't tell you how to treat people that are different from you in ways that you feel are vital for a person's ethos.* I offer my apologies to all those who felt hurt by a few number of comments that some people (may be even me) posted here. We sincerely don't mean to hurt anybody ever in the matters of book reading.. **May be we kid sometimes, here and there, but we are all a brotherhood here!** 

Thanks, everyone :) </TEXT>

I loved *Gitanjali*, liked *Of Mice and Men* and disliked *Old Man and the Sea*..

	<TEXT> The main thing that drove me and still drives me towards reading more books is *I'm an aspiring writer*.. and to write better you gotta read better and read like hell... So once I tried to take up writing seriously, and as they say *when you pick up one end of the stick you pick up the other end too..*, I had to take reading seriously as well... and that lead me through myriad portals toward the kind of stuff I'm interested to read/write about.. and I kept picking up books.. 

So, that's the most important thing about forming my reading habit.. and also another vital aspect is I was gifted a *Kindle Paperwhite* by my brother-in-law for my birthday around July 2013, and thence my reading habit got redefined :)

And coming to the part of feeling reading as a *chore*: I've a weakness in my mind.. that is when I start reading a book and if I don't feel interested in it or if it felt tough or anything, I simply cannot give up reading it.. I feel defeated by that book when I do that.. I somehow continue it till I end it.. So during such times, yes, reading feels like a chore... In the list I mention in the post, the books that especaily felt like that were: *The Loser* by Peter Ustinov and *Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde by R. L. Stevenson* (I'm trying to fight this weakness, which would help me save time and makes reading not to feel like a chore, at times..)

Rest all were fine, but I obviously didn't like all the books equally... 

So, that's about it :)

Thank you so much for the interest you showed in asking me about my habit forming.. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> yeah I love non-fiction.. especially the ones that talk about technology, economics, science, and ofcourse biographies... among the list the non-ficition books I read this year are *Next* by Micheal Lewis, *The Accidental Billionaires* by Ben Mezrich, *The Undercover Economist* by Tim Harford, *The Tipping Point* by Malcolm Gladwell, *Tuesdays with Morrie* by Mitch Albom... I loved each of them.. and among biographies, last year I read and **loved** *Into The Wild* and *Walden* (although not a bio) and another technology book about Big Data.. and I also started *Steve Jobs* by Walter Isaacson but did not finish it as I didn't carry the book with me later... But i loved whatever I read from it.

 The non-fiction book that I'm currently reading is *Representative Men* by Ralph Waldo Emerson.. and I plan to pick up *The Information* by James Gleick in 2015 :)

Non-fiction is almost always awesome :) </TEXT>

* Second paragraph was tough to read and sounded very confusing.
* Third slowly seemed to be losing direction.

Ok, now I better probably stop pointing out para wise.. All paragraphs can and should be improved for easy readability and visualization. 

Now, there are for sure very good lines from the letter:

 What are words, but dancers upon a page? 

Awesome opening line.

 the way you stabbed them with your tongue.

Very well put sentence.

 And this letter will never meet your lips.

I didn't get if the narrator was expecting the letter to be kissed (*meet the lips?*) or just be read (done by lips as well). If you meant 'to be read' this line can be better put as: *And this letter will never flow through your lips.*  or better: *And this letter will never flow through your lips and into your heart.*

And one more thing about my critique.. If my words hurt your feelings, don't take me seriously... Keep up the good work and do awesome writing as always.

[As you mentioned that you wrote this piece over a year ago, and as it is usually said that you need a good amount of time between you *write* something and you come back to edit or *re-work* on it... I guess you just didn't look into it after that year's time, and directly posted here without reworking upon it. It's visible, the *first-draftness* in the writing] </TEXT>

	<TEXT> First of all, I was expecting great story from the book because of all the hype of it being a classic and all.... and most importantly due to the depressive environment the entire book had bestowed upon me (I must say, in this case the author succeeded in making me feel the Dystopian time completely.. Orwell did great work at that)... So, I guess, I disliked the book mostly because I was expecting lot of great thrilling story from it rather than focusing on the classic idea of privacy invasion.. so that's the reason. My bad. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Recently got rejected by a girl in my workplace and Interstellar helped me get over it. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-12-17 07:35:24 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> (This is all from India) A couple of months ago I started liking a girl in my office.. She is a very beautiful girl.

 I'm a writer by hobby, and the beauty of that girl made me pen some lines about her. I wrote a poetic piece, titled as [Her](https://medium.com/@krishna_mydream/her-c95a39117644) and I gave it to her. I don't know if she even read it or not. I tried a few times to talk to her in person after showing her that poetry, but she straight away refused so talk to me. 

This whole incident had toubled me for weeks, my mind was occupied by her thoughts.. and then one fine day, November 8th, I watched the most awaited movie, *Interstellar* - and that's it.. The chains of that girl's beauty that had imprisoned my mind all along this time could not hold me back any longer, and they freed me.

 The grandeur of the cosmic tale told in the film had made my mind to wash away many trivial troubling things of my life, among which is my liking towards that girl. 

I'm an aspiring writer. After witnessing the mind bending brilliance of Interstellar, I realized that I had better things to do in my life than to sit back and feel bad for a rejection. 

Interstellar really expanded the horizons for my exploration of stories. Now, standing in front of the enigmatic journeys into the tales of wonders of the Unvierse I can voyage into, worrying about a girl seem merely unworthy of my mind's thought process.

Thank you so much for all this, *Interstellar* :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> First, simply put *Walden* is called an *American* classic because it is a classic work written by an american (I'm an Indian, by the way). 

And second, it is definitely a classic book, no questions asked. In *Walden* Thoreau's insights about where the Mankind is going in the matters of human character and environmental love, the two things that are put into each of us from the moment we take birth, are nothing less than astounding. There are many instances in the book that are capable of making us feel embarrased for the way we're living on this planet, without worrying least bit about this eternal(?) home of ours. If there is one book that should be seen with no boundaries of country, it would surely be this. Hence, please don't call *Walden* a specific *country's* classic, rather call it a Mankind's classsic, which it is undoubtedly is. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't generally read this kind of fiction.. I'm usually into Thrillers, Sci-Fi, Non-Fiction.. But after knowing that the movie by David Fincher has done so well I thought of picking up the book before watching the film adaptation of it.. and it was an amazing experince over all.. The most interesting part about the book is that both male (Nick) and female (Amy) narrations are great.. The thing that most intrigued me is how well Amy character turned out as the story moved forward.. It evolved very powerfully. I loved it. 

 A 4/5 book for me in the recent days... Awesome :) :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you so much for the interest.. It's a simple breathing pattern/technique. But I'm afraid I won't be able to articulate the process and benefits of Sudharshana Kriya as much as the *The Art Of Living Foudation* does, the institution where I learned it from.. So, [here is the link](http://www.artofliving.org/in-en/what-sudarshan-kriya) to where you can get a glimpse of what the Kriya process is all about.. Whatever is explained in there, believe it or not, it sure did change my thought process a couple of years ago, and I'm a person who stronly believes that your thoughts make your life, hence I can happily say that it did bring a great change in my life. (And you can also find many videos of the Kriya process on the internet, in case if you wanna try learning it.)

Good Luck and Namaste :) </TEXT>
