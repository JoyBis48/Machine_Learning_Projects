	<TEXT> Hi this is my first time building a PC an I am wondering how important are monitors?  Do they have to be comparable with certain parts or will any monitor do?  

I'm building a PC using the parts mentioned in this video + the extra parts in the comments could someone please recommend me a monitor to use.
