	<TEXT> GPU is in great working condition, with a little wear on the back panel.

Acer monitor just bought Aug 2013, so still works perfect. Keybord has evidence of wear and tear (see timestamp), but otherwise fine. Samsung monitor is a bit smaller at 1680x1050, but works fine as well. All monitors include cables.

Looking to get ~~$160~~150 incl. shipping or best offer for GPU. Taking offers for other components.

Verified PayPal only, I will invoice you and provide tracking number once shipped. Also willing to trade for Dragon Age Inquisition + $$$

~~[Timestamp](http://i.imgur.com/VKatAal.jpg)~~ 8800 Ultra, ignore timestamp. Can't tell my own GPUs apart -.-

Personally I went for a 970 and used the money I would have spent on a 980 to get a QNIX 1440p monitor. Far Cry 4 maxed at 53-60 FPS! </TEXT>

I 100% AC:B multiple times, must have put in 200 hours into that game. I rewatched all the Office episodes I had too.

If anyone ever goes away for a while, buy a Kobo and load it with books. You will go insane off a couple games and a show. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Absolutely. Best MMO on the market in the "theme park" genre. Everything about the game screams polish. WoW is the only MMO I can install, jump into and simply play without having to dick around with controls, graphics, annoying UI or weird mechanics. It's fairly simple, it's fun and it works.

	<TEXT> The best way to start would be in prayer and in the Bible. Pick a Gospel (I recommend John) and get reacquainted with scripture. Ask lots of questions and try to understand what the author is writing (or what Jesus is saying). Perhaps get a biblical commentary to help you understand the underlying themes and meaning.

Additionally, 

 I no longer go to church

Start going to church. Ignore that crap on the Internet about "existential Christianity" or "home churches." Find a real church. It doesn't matter what kind to start, as long as they practice sound doctrine. Catholic, Anglican, Lutheran, Baptist, it really doesn't matter since they teach essentially the same thing: God loved the world so much he sent his only Son, so that whoever believes in Him will not die but have everlasting life.

Ask your friends for some church recommendations or maybe go with them one Sunday. I know you're introverted (so am I), but make an honest effort, ask God in prayer, to get out of your shell and get connected with other Christians. Join a life/study group, volunteer at charity events and give yourself to the poor.

 Is it possible for me to do this in the comfort of my room

No. A Christian is called to go out into the world and *interact* with other people. Christ didn't sit in Nazareth and send people out to do his bidding - he went into the towns and ate with sinners and healed the sick.

 I'm thinking of contacting my old friend but I know she is very busy..

If she is the Christ-loving girl you make her out to be, she probably won't care and would love to sit down and talk with you. Make the effort, give her a phone call. Don't email her, don't text her. Call. Her. Phone.

Good luck buddy. </TEXT>

Essentially as a Christian you're to follow the law of the land (whatever state/country you reside in). If cannabis is illegal, you can't smoke it. If it is, go nuts, but do it in moderation as to not become addicted. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am guessing you don't have a toddler or spent any time around young children to see how incredibly selfish we are before we learn about etiquette and being good. Kids are assholes to each other.

It's the Christian belief we are sinful and broken *by nature,*  This sinfulness is a condition we brought upon ourselves and cannot be rectified by ourselves. You don't even need a history book or a TV to see evidence of this - sin permeates all societies of mankind, big or small. </TEXT>

I am not claiming to know anything; they're just fun questions to challenge ourselves with once in a blue moon. </TEXT>

Those extremists are fundementalists, I.e. they follow Islam to the tee. Most Muslims are moderate and ignore the evil in their own hadith and Quran. I'd say this is God acting in their hearts to be more Christ-like. </TEXT>
