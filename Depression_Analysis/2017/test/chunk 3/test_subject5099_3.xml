	<TEXT> TBH, with their rarity, it seems fine, if you get that lucky to get one of these books, or spend the time to, then its about as balanced as spawning next to a temple, not game ending, but good. Considering too the drop of books in dungeons, it seems okay. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> The UHCS Skype Chat </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-09-05 02:44:56 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> The UHCS skype chat, as I understand it, is for us to socialize, and it has been that way for a while, but or some reason lately it is filled with uninteresting, stupid guff that most people don't want to read or care about. Myself and many others have left the chat for this reason, where we were mostly there for information about the server, the occasional conversation was fine, but it had gotten out of hand.

A long time ago when the server was smaller and there were way less people, me and MG had a very long conversation about random stuff, that we were promptly told by many to stop, which we did, and talked in a private chat.

What I'm asking is to stop all this random stuff on the chat, and bring it back to its original purpose, the way it should be and was meant to be, not some role-playing chat with random topics that mean nothing to the chat. This is a plea for order, for the way things should be, not a spam-filled chat with things you can do elsewhere. </TEXT>
