Ok, my other ticket is going like this so far...

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1 Message by you on Sun, 2nd Dec 2012 9:48 pm

I read the fine print, I know it says you don't issue refunds. But you sold me an unplayable game. Doctor Who: The Eternity Clock has a glitch that won't allow me to pass a certain point in the game, a point none too deep I might add. I read the forums (I'm not the only one who has the glitch), attempted to contact the makers (never did respond), and have spent hours trying to get by it randomly (did once, but died immediately afterwards and got sent to the beginning of the level again, never could repeat getting past the glitch). All was for naught.

So in the end I was sold, by you, a game that cannot be played. Or at least, can only be played up to a point (London Underground II) and cannot be completed. May as well call it a demo that can only be played a few levels in.

As such, I can't see how it would be possible that I wouldn't be due a refund. I've uninstalled and re-installed the game (which didn't help), and have once again uninstalled it for good.


2 Message by you on Sun, 2nd Dec 2012 9:50 pm
BTW, if you have a fix for the game, I would be eternally grateful and would accept that in lieu of a refund.

Just give me the playable game I paid for or refund my money please.


6 Message by Support Tech Wiktor on Fri, 7th Dec 2012 5:47 am
Hello Scur,

As with most software products, we will not offer refunds or exchanges for purchases made online as outlined in the software license - please review Section 3 of the Steam Subscriber Agreement for more information.

Steam Subscriber Agreement
http://store.steampowered.com/subscriber_agreement/ 

Please send me a copy of your conversation with this third party support team, which outlines what steps youve taken to try to get the game working on your computer and I will investigate this matter further.


7 Message by you on Fri, 7th Dec 2012 11:31 am
I told them the same things I told you, essentially. Not much more to add. They still haven't contacted me, and I still paid you, Steam, for a game I can't play. In what world are you living in which that can't possibly be one of the few exceptions where you must provide a refund?


8 Message by you on Fri, 7th Dec 2012 11:40 am
I have 185 games so far on Steam. Are we really going to fall out of favor with each other over this?


9 Message by Support Tech Wiktor on Mon, 10th Dec 2012 3:55 pm
Hello Scur,

It appears you have not attempted to troubleshoot your issue with the third party support team. 

Please contact this support team and attempt to troubleshoot the issue you are experiencing.

Please send me a copy of this conversation with the third party support team, which outlines what steps you have taken to try to get the game working on your computer and I will investigate this matter further.


10 Message by you on Tue, 11th Dec 2012 9:47 am
...did you even read my original statement? I HAVE attempted to "troubleshoot my issue with the third party support team," but they will not respond after repeated attempts to contact them. I cannot force them to respond. Apparently you are privy to some secret method of making someone sit down and writing an email.

So I guess the dollars you've accepted from me in the past will have to suffice for the total amount you will ever receive from me. I will continue to use steam and play the games I've paid for, but you will NEVER see another cent from me again.

Thanks for nothing.


11 Message by you on Tue, 11th Dec 2012 10:05 am
Oh, wait. Scrolling up I see I told you twice that they won't respond. So apparently you're a dimwit who can't read, but can somehow copy/paste company-issued answers. Please have someone else respond. Preferably someone who knows how to spell "Victor,"


12 Message by you on Tue, 11th Dec 2012 10:10 am
And your supervisor would be preferable. I'd like him/her to see that you didn't even give my responses a cursory glance.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So in my aggravation with Wiktor, I called him a dimwit. I'll apologize in my final response to him, then close the ticket since he isn't interested in even reading anything.

So can you tell me, where do I stand? Steam just sold me a game I can't play or get any kind of support or response from the third-party developer, and now keeping my $8.99 with a "Sorry we sold you a game that has a glitch that won't let you play it, or get help with fixing, but we're going to keep your money."

I really do have a crap-ton of games on Steam (granted, the bulk of my items aren't the high-dollar new games but games bought during sales), and have never had this kind of trouble with Steam before. I would gladly continue to purchase games from Steam if we could resolve this, but the developer won't help or even respond, and it seems that Steam isn't very interested in anything except pointing their finger to the deaf ears of the devs and saying "I know we took your money, but take your problems up with them."

Hello Scur,

Thank you for contacting Steam Support.

I'm sorry you are having an issue with this game. 

When did you contact the third party support team?

If they have not responded to your original ticket, I would suggest creating a new support ticket with them. It is possible the ticket has been lost in their system. 

They will be able to assist you in resolving the issue.

3 Message by you on Thu, 13th Dec 2012 4:49 pm

I emailed support 3 times. Can you please just refund my money? It's become obvious that no help is coming. As I said before, I really don't want to have a falling out with Steam over $8.99, but I can't just allow myself to be ripped off like that by a corporation, as in paying for a product that doesn't work and to be refused a refund, a fix, or a replacement. I'm stubborn like that.

4 Message by Support Tech Raymond on Sat, 15th Dec 2012 4:35 pm

Hello Scur,

We do not offer refunds or exchanges.

Our records indicate that you have played this game for nearly ten hours, effectively using the license.

At what point in the game does the glitch occur? 

Have you tried the community discussions/forums for help?

5 Message by you on Sun, 16th Dec 2012 2:41 pm

I played for 10 hours trying to get past the glitch. I didn't just hit a wall and demand a refund. I put in a LOT of time, as in hundreds of attempts, to get past the glitch. It is during the London Underground II level. When I boost River up the second wall, she's supposed to reach down and pull the Doctor up, as she would any other wall. Instead she just jumps down to follow me.

Yes, I've hit the forums. Others have found this glitch, and no one knows a way to get past it.

So I have an unplayable game. Thanks for the info that you will do nothing except keep my money. I can now officially say that you've seen my last dime, and any new games I buy in the future will be through some other means. I will continue to use the games I've already bought from you in the hopes that every time I play a multi-player it will cost you some small bit and you'll never ever receive any more compensation for it from me.

Again, thanks for being the giant conglomerate that cares more about 9 bucks than, up until now, a dedicated customer. Don't send me any more rationalizations for your greed, please, it just increases my ire.

6 Message by you on Mon, 17th Dec 2012 4:21 am

Here at a later time, I'm re-reading this conversation and realizing I didn't play anywhere near 10 hours. Maybe I left it on or something, but I played an hour or less when I hit the glitch, and I know I spent more time than that off and on trying to get past it. Not that it changes anything or that you folks care or anything. Just putting that out there.

7 Message by Support Tech Raymond on Mon, 17th Dec 2012 6:38 pm

Hello Scur,

Can you provide a link to some of these forum discussions showing the issue?

8 Message by you on Tue, 18th Dec 2012 3:05 am

They're your forums, I'm not doing any more leg work. I've washed my hands of Steam, keep the nine bucks for all I care.

9 Message by Support Tech Raymond on Tue, 18th Dec 2012 10:15 pm

Hello Scur,

Please feel free to reply or reopen this ticket when you have the necessary information.

10 Message by you on Wed, 19th Dec 2012 3:26 pm

Necessary for what? For you to continue telling me you won't help me in any way? What possible reason can I have to continuing this conversation? It's obvious Steam will do absolutely nothing about the faulty product that they sold to me, except pushing me to find my own answers about possible solutions to the glitch. Am I wrong?

11 Message by you on Wed, 19th Dec 2012 3:30 pm

I am so utterly disappointed in Steam, so instead of fruitlessly looking for solutions that don't exist or trying to get any sort of resolutions from Steam, I am going to spend my efforts in showing everybody that I can what kind of company Steam really is when the chips are down. I think Reddit is a good starting point. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> While I agree that Task Killers aren't the best way to go, my Androids have always had memory and lag issues until I fiddle with the minfree values. I don't have a newer phone anymore, and I hear that Android has gotten better about memory management, but the GB phones I have now all have issues until I use AMM or V-6 Supercharger on them. I like lots of tools and system apps though that like to take up memory. When I restore apps on a fresh GB ROM, my phones all lag until I make adjustments. Stock GB just doesn't handle them well. Without those adjustments, I can easily see why task killers are so popular. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It was Detroit PD at first, but if there was any kind of evidence that suggested another state was involved, it would become federal. (best guess) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The old market app downloaded and installed as many at once as they could.

The new play store app will put them in a queue. It will download one, then it will install it. While it's installing the first app, it will download the second app. If the app is finished downloading before the first is finished installing, it will wait for the install to finish. It won't download a third app until the second one begins installing. So it will only  do 2 things at any time: download a single app and install a single app. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The reason why Google apps aren't included with CyanogenMods is because they aren't allowed to include Google apps with the custom mods. Copy-write laws and all that. So Google apps (gapps) must be installed separately. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Nice looking widgets, but I keep those in a toggle bar in my dropdown. Much handier place to keep them, imo.

I do like that WiFi widget, though. Good idea. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My X2 has a HDMI port, so when I wasn't using it it sat next to the TV and streamed video (damn you, Hulu!) and my Ascend was given to my 8 yr. old daughter with GrooVe IP so she has her own phone as long as she's within WiFi. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's how I feel about heights. When I was a kid I climbed trees and jumped from branch to branch like a monkey. Now if I try to, say, climb a ladder to the roof, by the time I get to the top I'm almost paralyzed. It's a horribly nerve-racking feeling. It doesn't matter how badly I want up there, it's just completely beyond my control. </TEXT>
