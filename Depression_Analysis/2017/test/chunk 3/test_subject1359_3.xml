	<TEXT> I had one installed for a surprise for Valentines Day in my bedroom.
Had fun and enjoyed the novelty of it that night with the girl I'm dating after a couple bottles of wine.
I didn't have to work in the morning but she did so she left late that night.
As I awoke the next morning, a bit hungover, with the sun beaming through the window and almost had a heart attack when I opened my eyes cause I thought a naked guy was falling on me. </TEXT>
