	<TEXT> Hi!  I have a photoblog http://www.test_subject6067.com and I just added the travel-at a glance page on the nav bar.  I made it a parent page to two other pages (California, Nevada), and I would like it to just drop down instead of always taking you to the parent page.  I'm not sure if I'm making any sense lol but any help would be appreciated.  Thank you! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you make cold process soap, you could puree them without the seeds/stem and make pear soap!  I do that with fruit all the time.  Or maybe put the puree on your face like a fresh fruit face mask. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree, most of the shaving soaps people seem to recommend are all tallow based.  I have met lots of people that were allergic to lanolin, so perhaps offering some with and some without would be the best choice.  ty! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Tallow definitely turns many people off, but I have noticed that popular shaving soaps all have it.  There are vegetable oils that give vegan soaps a similar lather so I'll definitely be testing out lots of recipes.  I agree samples is king! lol </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I will definitely try using a brush and a razor to shave my legs to test out the quality of the lather.  And I definitely agree with you on the adding bentonite clay and calling it shaving soap phenomenon .  All it seems to do is add a little slip.  Definitely not the great lather I've seen on many youtube videos demonstrating shaving soap.  Thank you for the advise :D  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi everyone!  I've been a soap maker for 10 years and recently decided to start selling.  I would love to make some great shaving soaps to add to my line.  Since I don't have a beard, I'm not really sure what makes a great shaving puck.  There are lots of glycerin soaps that give extra lather, but do you guys think that they perform well enough? Do you guys have a preference when it comes to an all veggie soap or one made with tallow or lard?  Do you like a soap puck that comes in a container already or prefer a puck by itself?  Thank you guys so much!   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi everyone!  I've been keeping a worm factory worm bin on my balcony for the last 3-4 years very successfully.  I've always seen a couple of maggots in my bin, but not a lot.  I just pick them out and toss them.  Suddenly in the last 2 months there's been more but today I just checked and I couldn't find any worms in the top 2 bins!  Everything I see moving are small maggots!  Now.. I'm not sure exactly what I should do.  If I stop feeding them I'm afraid that my worms will starve (I think they are already) but there seems to be too many for me to pick out.  Any help would be appreciated :D </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes I agree, I'm almost 100% sure we'll just take a bus to AC.  AC to DC... we might just rent a car and split it.  Now I"m just trying to figure out the toll roads situation.  I don't even have an idea of about how much it will cost since it looks like we'll be hitting up 3-4 toll stops. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hello East Coasters! 5 of us will be in NYC till Friday and wanted to check out Atlantic City before we leave.  I wanted to know if you guys had any tips on how to get there from Times Square.  I saw that there are a few bus options and was thinking about trying Greyhound's Lucky Streak.  Is that a good choice?  

After a fun Friday in Atlantic city, we will have to travel to DC on Saturday and needed a recommendation on how to get there.  Are there bus options?  Should we subway it?  Rent a car? Any tips would be appreciated! Thank you ahead of time :D </TEXT>
