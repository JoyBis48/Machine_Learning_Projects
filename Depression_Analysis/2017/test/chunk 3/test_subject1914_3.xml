	<TEXT> i'm just gonna be blunt if you haven't been spotted by now theres a very slim chance you will make it. keep putting in good performance's for your club and hope to get noticed by a scout. Australia's poor youth programme won't help but  chances are slim though best of luck though </TEXT>

	<TEXT> its going better on my arsenal save. i stormed the league in my first season and won the champions league (probably my proudest achievement) beating man united in the semis. however my second season was disaster made some wrong moves in the transfer window and ended up finishing 9th 
i got to the semis of the champions league the league cup and the fa cup all knocked out by man united ( I'm glad the old rivalry is back though) 
i somehow managed to keep my job and most of my important players. now I'm in my third season and I'm two points of top but I'm just targeting a top 4 finish.i have also had a lot of fun bringing my youth through dan crowley serge gnabry and a few others are now semi regulars. but yeah thats it at the moment  </TEXT>
