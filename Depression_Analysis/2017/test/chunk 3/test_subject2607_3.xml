	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hello, I need help figuring out how to become more social. I know that lots of people just aren't social and that's okay, but it sucks always feeling left out because I'm too scared to talk to anyone. I'm a 15 year old girl, and even from a young age I've never been able to talk to other kids. I have a few really close friends that I can talk to easily, but with everyone else, it's a lost cause. Sometimes when I really want to say something to someone that I don't know well, I'll count to 10 and say it, but it always comes out in awkward stutters. I think my problem is that people will think I'm weird or they don't like me. Online, I'm able to talk to you guys super easily, but if we were face-to-face it would be all kinds of awkward. I know that everyone thinks I'm really nerdy, because I'm in marching band and get really good grades. Even in marching band though, I can only talk to a select few people. I always feel left out from the group, and it kind of sucks, because everyone else is so close. Do you guys have any tips that could help me with my social awkwardness? Because I can't take it anymore. </TEXT>

Instrument: Euphonium

Show Name: Music Royale

Repertoire: Bicycle Race by Queen, Hit the Road Jack by Ray Charles, King Kong by Jimmy Castor, Hall of the Mountain King

Unfortunately, as you can probably tell, we don't compete and we're a show band. We just go to invitationals, festivals, and play at parades and football games. We are a very good band though. Straight 1's at festival for the past three years, we got first place from 150 bands at the Mackinaw City memorial day parade, and we're going to be in the Detroit Thanksgiving Day Parade on national television. Last time we went there we got first. I wish we competed though tbh. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's exactly how I've been trying to handle it. I've accepted the fact that I'm not over him, but I don't let my friends say bad things about him anymore. I just try not to think about it. He goes to the other high school in my district, so I only see him occasionally at marching band competitions and invitationals. He told my friend that he wanted to get back together with me, but I realized that he would hurt me like that again, so I just didn't talk to him. But I definitely have been moving on and thinking about other guys, and that has helped me. It was rough, but it is getting a lot better. Thank you. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> My story </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-07-10 00:59:02 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I am a teenage girl who has been dealing with depression and anxiety for about a year and a half. Cutting and suicidal thoughts are things I had issues with for a long time. Before I tell my story, I want to say that finding this, and looking at some of the posts, made me feel less alone. Feeling alone is all too familiar to everyone on this subreddit, and it's amazing that a group of people who are feeling the same things and battling the same things can come together to discuss and guide each other. That's beautiful.

Now for the my story. As a young child, I never fit in. I was always the weird fat girl, and living in a wealthy town full of girls with entitlement issues  didn't help. My mother is very down to Earth, and since it was only her and I living together, we didn't have much money. We were by no means poor, but I didn't live in a fancy house in a nice subdivision, nor did I wear designer brand clothes like all the other kids. My parents divorced when I was two, and my dad was in and out of prison. With all of this being said, I spent most of my time alone and playing by myself when I was little. I had no siblings and no friends to play with. 

Then when I was 10 or 11, about to start middle school, my mother made a spur of the moment decision to move to a town about 10 or 20 miles outside the one we were living in. I was not excited. There were some bad areas of the town, and it intimidated me. My mom tried to assure me that I'd make lots of new friends and that everyone would be nicer. I didn't believe her, because I believed that kids were mean, and that's just how it was. I had no idea that there really were nice kids out there. I started middle school and everything was well, and I was amazed when I wasn't made fun of on the first day. I was very introverted, and didn't have any friends until about halfway through the school year, when I started taking to Jessie, a beautiful trumpet player in my band class who I though was extremely cool. I am still friends with her today, and I met most of my other friends though the people that Jessie knew in elementary school. 6th and 7th grade were good, and while I wasn't popular, and was still "the weird fat girl" in some people's eyes, I had a group of friends that I loved. I was content. 

Then the summer before 8th grade, my father passed away due to a prescription drug overdose. I tried to avoid it, and pretend that it never happened, which only fueled my mourning. My father wasn't perfect, and there were points where I would only see him two or three times a year, but he loved me. He adored me. In the letters he sent to my the rest of my family, he never shut up about me. The thing that hurt me the most is that the last the we talked was on the phone, and I didn't tell him I loved him. As with all deaths, I mourned and then gradually moved on with my life. When 8th grade started, all was well, and I still had the same group of friends.

About halfway through the year, I developed a crush on a close friend, Brandon. He also came from a broken home, with a dead mother, an abusive father, and being in his grandparents' custody with his older brother. I told him, and in early March we started dating. I loved this boy. He was my first boyfriend, first kiss, and first everything. Being the naive young kid I was, we had sex. Because hey, if he's willing to have sex with me, that must mean he really loves me right? Well as you would expect, he broke up with me shortly afterwards, after coming on a vacation with my family and I for my birthday. About a week after my birthday, he randomly became very distant and would only talk to me briefly once every few days, where we used to FaceTime for hours and hours every day. Then one day I sent him a message and asked what was wrong, and after a short argument, he called me on FaceTime. He said he had to break up with me to "protect me" and we were both sobbing. I didn't hear from him for over a year. 

In all honesty, I never really got over him. I still have dreams about him on a nightly basis, and I think he was the thing that really fueled my depression. For once in my life, I felt a mutual love with one of my peers, and then it was gone. I now realize the he used me, and he was very controlling, but I loved him.  I spent weeks and weeks crying over the breakup, but of course, I started getting over it slowly but surely. That was my first experience with cutting. I was sad, and mad at myself, so I grabbed the dull knife from the kitchen and sawed at my arm until there was a swollen cut, with blood oozing out. It felt good. The physical pain distracted me from the mental pain, and for those moments, it relieved my stress. 

Through freshman year, cutting was an issue. I continued to earn good grades and smile, but in marching band, a close-knit group of friends, I felt like an outsider. Jessie made new upperclassmen friends, and I was the awkward weird girl who wouldn't talk to anyone. It got really bad in the winter, and those are when the thoughts got more hostile and I felt more alone. I began more and more to sit in my room alone and listen to music, and avoid everyone around me. It was the same routine at this point: wake up, go to school or pretend I was sick, then lay and bed and sulk. I began becoming anorexic, not eating for a couple days at a time. I have since gotten better with eating, although the thought still rises occasionally. I was put on Zoloft when I was 14 as well as attended therapy, and it helped for a while, but now I am falling back into that pit of loneliness. We quit therapy a few months ago because it became too much money for my mom to handle.

Being a teenager, I like to tell myself this is a phase, or a mere hormone imbalance, but at this point I know it's not. Nothing seems beautiful, and I can find sadness and despondence in most everything. I can't shake the lonely, worthless feeling constantly plaguing me, and I needed to tell my story to people who would understand and point me in the right direction. I really feel less alone now, and I can relate to so many of you. Thank you for reading this, and I look forward to being a supportive part of this subreddit. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I love Harmony Korine so much. Maybe I'm just a pretentious asshole, but I absolutely loved Gummo. It was so unsettling, I loved it. </TEXT>
