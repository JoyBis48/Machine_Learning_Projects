	<TITLE> WILD questions (this is different than fear-related questions) </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-04-26 20:29:02 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> 1. I have problems sleeping face up and I can only sleep on my left side. Can I preform WILD on my side? Cause' in all the tutorials they are on their back.

2. What positions should I keep my jaw in?

3. What should be going through my head?

Please don't answer if you haven't successfully done WILD. I always seem to get answers from those people.  

Thanks! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Forget Skyrim, it's a great game and all that, but the real fun is in Oblivion and Morrowind. Skyrim's quests are all the same, "I lost my ring! Please go into the random fucking cave and get it for me. Watch out for draugrs!"
While the other gameS in the series are like, "I lost my ring! Please get it for me it's in the well! ....... Haha! now you're trapped! I can use you in my demonic ritual now! WAIT NO, WHAT ARE YOU DOING! NO, STOP EXPOSING ME AS A NECROMANCER!" </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A old age of empires-like game called Black and White 2 is awesome, you can be a evil god to your cities or a good god, you get to control the world with this big hand and it changes as you become evil or good, also the wars in the game are cool too because you can do things like throw rocks at the other armies.

Any fable game would also be a good choice, it's an RPG where you make choices that make yourself good or evil, your weapons, armour and spells depend on your good and evil traits too. You can do things like marry someone, have kids, THEN BRUTALLY MURDER THEM :D!

Lastly Just Cause 2, short description, fuck the storyline, go be a terrorist on the huge sandbox map you have to explore. You can do things like, steal a car, cover it in C4 drive it off a bridge, land on a speed boat, jump out of the car, grapple hook onto a chopper, throw out the pilot, shoot the C4 with a missle and watch the whole thing go up in flames. Plus being on PC you can mod the game and do things like give yourself unlimited ammo and invincibility!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When I came into elementary school, everyone was mean to each other, it was a toddler popularity battle. So when I got to middle school, most everyone put that behind them. I didn't. I was a ass to one kid for about 1.5 years then I had a teacher who kind of became my mentor. He never knew I was a bully, But he taught me human values. I stopped being mean to him and we were kind of acquaintances. The next year in high school I said I was deeply sorry and that I knew there was no way I could fully make it up to him. He did forgive me though. After that I became SUPER sensitive to any form of bully, no to me though, to other people. I stood up for people as much as possible. Not sure if this helps, or even if this will be seen, but best description I have is ALOT of self resentment and guilt that the bully doesn't know how to deal with. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So, if I wanted to get the cooling system later that would be all good? Also I was wondering about this PC's performance with a over the top game like crysis 3, I don't think I'm even gonna play Crysis 3, but I was just curious.

Thanks so much for the help! </TEXT>

I'm looking to play on a BF3 graphics (high to medium) level; but I don't know what that looks like. I don't have a very large budget but I can afford this one (max about 530$ish).

I already have a copy of win7 so that's no on there for that reason. If I did this completely wrong, or there is a different better/ inexspensive part, please, do tell. Thanks for the help. :)

edit: spelling

Holy shit this sub is amazing! </TEXT>

( have Zer0 and Axton finished) So I tried to use gibbed save editor and had no luck. Error after error. There aren't any good tutorials on how to do it for PS3 so I would love if someone could explain it in full detail. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Dude it's a serious question, it's something he's afraid of. Just because you're annoyed by someone trying to get help on a sub where that's totally welcome doesn't mean you get to be a bully and talk about how cool you are, when you say "All I do is wait it and and boooom close your eyes and think of a dream or a mirror and ENTER IT" (or whatever the hell that gibberish means.) or how you "had a Dementor from Harry Potter suck my face when I was in bed. No fucks given. Get the hell over it."

You're not some all knowing lucid dreamer, you're a bully on reddit, and you're the shit that's wrecking this sub *and* reddit as a whole. You fucking snob.

	<TEXT> I had tons of fun beating the campaign solo, it can be done it's a little bit harder than co-op and after you beat everything you can do what im doing now and collect all of the special guns. Plus with sub-reddits like [r/coopplay ](http://www.reddit.com/r/coopplay) and [r/borderlands](http://www.reddit.com/r/borderlands) you can get co-op players easy!
I completely recommend this game, it's my favorite. </TEXT>
