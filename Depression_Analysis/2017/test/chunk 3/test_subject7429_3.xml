	<TEXT> Do you have to keep putting cars back into the garage (mainly the 4 car ones)? I've noticed that if I took one out and didn't put it back in or it got destroyed, it would no longer be saved in the garage. This happened 3 times (once in franklin's/aunt's house garage, once in Trevor's 4-car garage, and once in michael's 4-car garage) and I'm wondering if it's a glitch or the game is supposed to be like that. </TEXT>
