	<TEXT> It depends. For instance, my hometown had its sewage treatment plant in the south part of town, and it stank to high heaven because nobody cared enough about odor abatement. When they switched to district representation, and the city commission had a rep from that part of town for the first time, it got cleaned up fairly quickly.

District representation makes some things better and some things worse. We'll have to see how the balance shakes out here. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Any PRAW wizards in Austin? </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi folks. I'm a grad student working on a project that involves downloading posts and comments from a couple of Reddit subs, and I'm a complete noob at Python and so on. I'm trying to self-teach, but it's slow going, and I need a boost.

So if anyone in Austin can meet me and show me how to do the stuff I need to do (or explain that it can't be done, though I'm confident it can) in PRAW and how to manage the output so it's in a form I can use, I'd be happy to pay for a lesson or two.

(My project isn't "about" scraping Reddit data, my adviser doesn't care how I get the stuff off the site, so this isn't a "do my homework for me" request.)

Thanks! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I made my GF watch this one, because she had lost my car.

Kind of a long story, but I went out of town for a couple of weeks, and her car needed repairs so she used mine while it was in the shop, and when her car was ready she drove my car downtown to pick it up, intending to come back on the bus later to get my car, only she just plumb forgot, and didn't remember till days later. By that time it had been towed from the 2-hour lot, of course. She was appropriately apologetic and paid the fines, so no harm done. 

In fact she enjoyed the movie, unexpectedly considering what a guy flick it is, and so did I. Though our fun was probably enhanced by the absurdity of the previous events. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The critics basically all have to see it, but the audiences are self-selected; they only go to a movie if they're confident it's their kind of thing. So more than half of moviegoers in general might think it's a bad movie, but they won't rate it online because they went to something else instead. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> He's written about the process in past years and has gotten a lot more out of it. 10 days working full time (because this is his job) should be plenty to find the interesting bands, and this year everyone was from LA instead all over. Now that the festival depends so heavily on corporate sponsors, they bring in more bands the corporations already like and fewer unknowns. It doesn't matter if ~2200 bands are in town if they're all the same thing. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Most of the bands here for the music portion only get to play one official set, but they're here to get noticed, so there's a secondary economy of bands playing gigs all over town at unofficial venues, including a lot that don't have live music otherwise. Just wander around central Austin and you'll hear a lot of them.

Several years ago I lived at the north end of West Campus and just walking up the street in the afternoon I could generally catch four or five bands. </TEXT>

Yeah, this. I moved nearby in 2007 and loved the place, but sometime around 2010 it was noticeably going downhill, and by the last time I was in there last year it was basically all Hello Kitty merchandise. It seemed like a bizarre trajectory. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not quite. They only count the congested parts of roads. The congestion index only accounts for the parts of roads between Waco and Austin that are actually slowed down by traffic. In the NYC area (and other big metros) there are longer stretches of slowed-down roads. 

If you're happy with a short but slow commute, then you're happy because you live close to work, not because traffic is light. Because it isn't. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The [methodology section](http://scorecard.inrix.com/scorecard/methodology.asp) says, if I'm reading it right, that they take the road lengths into account -- that is, NYC drivers sit in traffic longer, but that's partly because they drive farther on average. So, say, a theoretical 10-minute drive that takes 30 minutes is more congested than a 20-minute drive that takes 50 minutes, by that measure. Again, if I'm reading it right. </TEXT>
