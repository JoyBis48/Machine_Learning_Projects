	<TEXT> The one with the guy telling us he had a concussion due to a football accident and tells us a story how he lived a life until he was 40 had wife, kids, successful job, until one day, he saw a lamp in his house but it wasn't a lamb. It was bent, in a way it would appear to defy all common laws. He stared at it for weeks. His wife was concerned about him, he just stared at it. Until he realized it was fake, the lamp didn't exist. He woke up shortly after in the hospital bed. He had severe depression and couldn't cope anymore. He had lived 40+ years with a woman he loved, and a child he had, he said he sometimes sees the kid in his phericpheral.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Somebody has to do it. It depends on personality and morals really. I can never be a laborer, I'm not willing to fatigue my body for a living, instead I want to heal people mentally and physically. Same for jobs that face violence every day, e.x  police, military excursions. It just depends on the person. Not saying neither of any jobs is bad or great. It's just what you want to do with your life.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 1) You pay the payment on the credit card website. Look at the credit's websites for a "Make payment" button and enter a bank account, whom you will be making the payment from.

2) As far as I know, it's best to use the card each month, so it will be "active" and will show a history of credit. Of course pay in full each month. 

Personal advice: Discover Student is the way to go, I got it when I turned 18. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> social media is a terrible habit if you don't use it as a tool to be productive in life e.x right way to use it: message your friends. See group posts about academics or follow major events that give coupons. e.x of bad way to use it. Be on social media for 5+ hours a day doing stupid shit. If you are the latter, then idk what you can do.
