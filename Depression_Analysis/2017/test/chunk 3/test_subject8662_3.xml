	<TEXT> A couple people have said they don't think they'd pull through, but I still say you'd be shocked. 

Honestly the stereotypical emo description really works best. It's like you're walking down a long dark tunnel with water up to about mid-shin. It's cold, clammy, uncomfortable at all times and all you want to do is just lay down and not feel that anymore. After a while, that becomes your reality and the cold clamminess almost supplants the concept of the warm blanket. It's almost comfortable.  </TEXT>
