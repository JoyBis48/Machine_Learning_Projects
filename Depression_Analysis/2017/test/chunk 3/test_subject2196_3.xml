	<TEXT>   I dropped my Samsung Galaxy tab 3 in the toilet a while back. All the water should be out of the system, however while the device seems to be fully functional with some input delay that hadn't been there before, except for the whole "ten minutes to boot" deal.  
  Now this would not be too big of a problem if the device didn't already have a glitch where it would crash if plugged into a micro USB occasionally...
   I have factory restored it for the hell of it, it still connects to my desktop and I can access the device. I would appreciate any advice or suggestions. </TEXT>
