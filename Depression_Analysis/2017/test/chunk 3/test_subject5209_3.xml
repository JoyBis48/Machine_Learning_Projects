	<TEXT> Yes, I am glad that I didn't. I don't want him to worry about something that I did to myself in the past. He has his own issues to deal with and I didn't feel like burdening him with one of mine.

And what you said last is something that I find to be very true now. Last night I found out that my friend has gone through the same exact situation I'm in now...only 8 years ago. After our talk last night, I realized that we have a lot more in common than I originally thought. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm going through a lot of shit right now (that I don't feel like divulging at the moment). I got a text from a friend asking if I wanted to join him for some drinks at a bar tonight. I said sure and a couple of hours in, we were having serious conversations about our lives.

I came really close to telling him about how the scar on my arm was from when I felt my life was in a tailspin and the pain from cutting was the only thing that I could actually control. As soon as I got ready to say it, I chickened out. I just couldn't imagine what one of my closest friends would think about me.

I don't cut anymore, but every time I sweat while playing basketball or working out...it becomes very visible. I guess that will be with me for the rest of my life.

There's no real point to this post. I just needed to get that out. </TEXT>

The sheep do not want the dog around. He looks too much like the wolf. He reminds them that danger lurks out there just beyond the relative safety of the fence.
  
The wolf also hates the dog. He knows that it is the dog that stands between him and his prey. It is because of the dog that he is lean. The dog is the reason the wolf is forced to stalk the darkness.
  
The dog knows these facts. Undeterred, he stands watch, ever ready to do battle. Despite that he is a welcome guest in their midst, the dog is ready at a moments notice, to give his life in defense of his flock. It is simply who he is. </TEXT>
