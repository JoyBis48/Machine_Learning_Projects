All of his systems were go. His psyche was soldered firmly to his pineal gland, and he even had a small soul powered by flashlight batteries. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Generally, if you do any work (paid or unpaid) while you are on unemployment you must report that and your unemployment payments will be reduced. In New York it's 1/4 off your weekly check for any day you work, no matter how much time during the day you spend working.

Not to mention that, under the FLSA, any work you do for an employer must be paid. You can not work for free.

On the other hand, you could turn this into a networking opportunity and use your old work e-mail address to ask your old clients if they have any positions open.

Really, this just sounds like a bad idea all around. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My experience with Kirby was 28 years ago, so take this with a that caveat.

When I was hired as Kirby salesman, I was promised a small base salary with commissions. I never received any salary and  I'm pretty sure they didn't pay me all the commission owed when I quit. I sold four units in the six weeks I worked there and was paid a total of $300 plus some gas money.

The units are very expensive. It was over $900 when I was selling them back in 1986. I hear they're close to $3000 now. That's a huge ask for a dirt sucker. You can get a top of the line Dyson for 20% of that. 

When I was hired, I was promised training and guidance for the first four weeks as I shadowed an experienced salesman. I went out on my own after being with the company for two days. 

There are people who make a lot of money selling these things. And, in all fairness, the lessons I learned going into people's houses and pitching a $900 vacuum cleaner two or three times a day for those six weeks have served me well in my various jobs since then. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Why are you concerned about what's legal or not? Why would anyone take a job like that? Why would you work for a company that would offer a job like that? It's insane.

Figuring a three hundred mile distance (five hours at 60MPH) between both cities, you'd be spending over a $100 a week in gas alone, assuming you have a decent car and gas prices don't go back up. You'd put over 75k miles on your car in the span of a year.

Seems to me that somebody at this company is trying to cheap out, hiring one engineer to fill in at both locations instead of hiring one for each.

There's a lot of meh in seasons 1 and 2, but I think you can say that about any of the Star Trek series. Once you get to season 3 things are really clicking and season 4 was very enjoyable.

	<DATE> 2015-03-14 14:28:09 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Before the the whole FEC thing came down, my plan was to pick up a used LG G2 on eBay, once that model became available for transfer, and retire my old Galaxy S2, which has given me good service, but is getting a bit long in the tooth.

Then I figured I'd wait a bit after the new year, figuring there would be a lot of used phones for sale after people got their new shiny for X-Mas. Well, that was a mistake.

So, what to do now? Is there some resolution for this in the pipeline? As far as I can tell, my only decent option now is to wait or buy a new device from Ting.  

I really don't want to switch to GSM. My workplace has Sprint repeaters and I get excellent service. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I loved it when it was on, but back in the 80's there was a real shortage of SF/Fantasy/Genre shows so we  tended to latch on to whatever they deigned to show us. I loved the 80's Buck Rogers show, which has little to recommend it these days except Erin Gray in skin-tight spandex outfits.

GAH is a show very much of its time. It has problems common to superhero shows of that period including a lack of super villains and terrible VFX.

I'd give it a few episodes if you're interested.   </TEXT>

The only thing I'd say is not to get ahead of yourself. You don't know what their offer will be or even if you'll get one. Wait until you have the  numbers, then decide. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If he thought what he was doing was legal, then he should have gone to court and argued the point.

It's clear that he knew what he was doing was illegal because, instead of downloading the JSTOR files from his desk at Harvard, he went to MIT and abused their open computer resources to make his political point. 

In the process, he created no end of headaches for the network admins at MIT as well as students, faculty and researchers who had their access to JSTOR curtailed while Swartz evaded their attempts to kick him off their network.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You handle it like you'd handle any other job where you had a falling out with your boss. Be honest about having difficulties with your supervisor without getting too specific about the gory details. Explain that, due to your interpersonal issues, you don't expect to get a good reference from them. 

If you can, you find someone, a co-worker or client, that you worked with who can give you an alternate reference for that job.

Since it was a family business, you can calmly explain without getting into to much detail, that you had a falling out with with your parent in part because you make a clean break and strike out on your own.

Best of luck to you. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's neat. I didn't realize that Gotham and Rome shared the same creator. Gotham certainly has its issues, but I'm enjoying it overall and given how great Rome was, it gives me some hope for the future of Gotham.

Interestingly enough, I saw the parallels between Gotham's Bruce Wayne and Rome's Octavian right from the beginning. Gotham may run into the same issue that Rome did if they decide to time jump and replace David Mazouz.

	<TEXT> Seems like a good lineup, although I'm not a big fan of any iteration of Hawk and Dove.

Disappointing not to see Cyborg and Beast Boy in the lineup, but making either of those characters look halfway decent on a TNT budget is probably nigh impossible.

Not that this was ever going to happen anyway, but I guess that ends any possibility of another Birds of Prey TV show.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What did your boss say when you told him how much the recruiter was taking? 

If I were you, I'd go back to the recruiter and tell them you want a 30% bump effective immediately or you're going to start looking for new work and you're going to tell the client exactly why. I doubt they want to queer the relationship with such a valuable client. </TEXT>
