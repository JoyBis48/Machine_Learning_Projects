	<TEXT> I know it's easier said than done, but enjoying your time together is a million times better than worrying. Diane loved Portal. She would sing the songs from both. The graphics in Portal 2 gave her motion sickness, sometimes, though.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you. I used to be cynical about such things but there's no way I could have survived this if Diane hadn't assured me that she's still out there somewhere. She knew that. 

I know she has to be a very pure soul in order to pull something like that off, so wherever she is now, must be a good place. She deserves that more than anyone I've ever met.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you, and I do feel very fortunate for our last few hours together. I attribute that entirely to Diane being a very pure soul.  </TEXT>
