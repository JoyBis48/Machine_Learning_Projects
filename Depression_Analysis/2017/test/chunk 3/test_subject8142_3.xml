	<TEXT> Yeah Sampson got a few guys likes Gordon, but a huge issue was that for most part his guys weren't serious about basketball. He was essentially running a program like Blue Mountain State. The only guys who weren't getting stoned and drunk all the time his last year were Gordon and White, which is part of the reason neither came back. And why a lot of the guys in state weren't considering it.

Side note, posts like these just remind me of how much talent the state produces. I think half my high school's losses while I was there were to nba lottery picks. </TEXT>
