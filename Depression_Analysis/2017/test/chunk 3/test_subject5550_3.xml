	<TEXT> The US air drops around Kobane resulted in 20% of the weapons going to IS. The US weapons to the "moderate" groups have resulted in 2 of 12 moderate groups defected - with TOWs and other weapons - to Nusra (similar to IS). US weapons to Sahwa (The Sunni Awakening) are also now firmly in IS hands with the mass executions.

Basically, along with the weapons given to the Iraqi army that IS looted over the past months, we've effectively armed the people we've declared war against - supposedly for a good reason. It's just been one epic fuck up. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not going to give a value judgement on the concept, but happy to explain it. What your right hand posses is a reference to female slaves of age.

Although Muhammad encouraged the freeing of adult slaves in general, Islam doesn't completely prohibit slavery. That doesn't mean slavery in Islam is anything like what was done to the Africans transported over to the United States by people who's religion laid down no laws with reference to slavery. Slavery in Islam is not perpetual and doesn't transcend subsequent generation. Every slave earns a wage, the wage must be paid timely and they eventually earn their freedom. It does mean that, as a general rule, Muslims can cohabit with female slaves who are of age.

As far as Muslims following the rules associated with it in modern times, its rather difficult. You get slaves by winning wars. Islam doesn't just allow you to pick up random people and declare them your slaves. You also (generally) can not enslave other Muslims - so when a Muslim extremist group fights another Muslim extremist group, they don't get to take any slaves. In the recent past, Muslims have generally been fighting other Muslims so there hasn't been a lot of associated booty or slaves.

Slavery in Islam isn't simply about sex though. Suppose you're at war, and your army kills a child's family. The child is your slave, but the majority of the world would look at rearing the child as 'adoption' and not outright slavery. In any case, the topic is a lot more nuanced. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you're not Muslim, you'll be paying 5% jizya tax on your earnings. If you are Muslim however, you'll only pay 2.5% zakat tax - but, you run the risk of being drafted into the standing army. As a member of the fighting force, if you don't die, you'll be forced to fork over 20% of earnings as khums tax. Avoiding taxes with IS is like taking out a mortgage - you can pay a shittier fixed rate, or pay the lower rate with the possibility of being sucked into something much riskier. Going as a non-Muslim under a guarantee of safety is probably your best tax-bracket bet. </TEXT>

Rather than focus on the meat of the tape, we focused on the fact that a government official used the F-bomb.

	<TEXT> Can one identify a Shi'te from a Sunni from appearance or accent? 

No. The issue most people, especially in the West, don't want to touch with a ten foot pole is that the only way to do this is through the collaboration of locals. It goes back to the (now ignored) suffering of Sunnis in Iraq over the past several years under the democratically elected Shi'ite government.

Some people hypothesized that they can ask questions or ask you about something Sunni-specific. Firstly, that makes sense if you have 5-6 prisoners. It's not a reasonable way to go about things to have an interview for 200 prisoners. This also discounts that mainstream Shi'ism is a reactionary religion to the Orthodoxy. Religious texts of Shi'ites actually teach Shi'ites about the majority opinions as well - their belief is that their leaders did put on a public face as Sunnis but were secretly teaching a completely different religion. It would be rather difficult to single out Shi'ites on this alone.

What would make things easy is lining up 300 men, bringing around villagers who sympathize with you and who suffered at the hands of some of the prisoners. Have them point out the guys they like to keep alive from amongst the prisoners, guys they'd particularly want dead, etc. </TEXT>

according to witnesses who said most of the victims were members of the police or an anti-Islamic State militia called Sahwa (Awakening).

Is it a war crime? Dunno enough about international law, but seems like a mass execution of unarmed prisoners would be. Is it the carte blanche murder of an entire demographic or whole generation? No. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> A Pattern of Biased Censorship on /r/WorldNews - Especially over the last few days </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-10-17 08:27:32 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hypothesis: There is a pattern indicative of bias in moderation by certain moderators at r/worldnews.

Test: Do you have examples of this bias? Please post your analysis - or cases you notice (especially if you have information about the mods involved) at http://np.reddit.com/r/isrworldnewsbiased/

In the past two days, I've seen three articles, several with karma in the 3 digit range, get removed. The recurring theme in each of those articles? They all brought up Israel - and they all did so in a not-so-positive light. I've never seen the moderation team act so swiftly and I must commend them for staying ever-vigilant. At the same time, it's a bit troubling that articles critical of Russia, China and ISIS keep seeming to get accidentally missed by their moderation team even when the articles are from (a) baseless sources or (b) opinion pieces. It's also troubling that in spite of the vigilance of the moderation team with respect to articles that point out terrorism practiced by Israelis, that they seem to keep missing other articles that their logic for removal would apply to. I've set out to help our friends at r/worldnews. They're probably just dropping the ball because they're super-duper busy.

I've started the above sub to keep track of cases like this. Here are the benefits to having a sub for this purpose:

- When somebody asks you why you referred them to /r/worldpolitics when there's a default sub with over a million subscribers that even Google picks up, you can link them to /r/isrworldnewsbiased. Rather than break it down explicitly for them, you can tell them why alt subs are healthy for the ecosystem.

- When somebody asks you why you're being a such a crazy tin-foil hat wacko and criticizing the immaculate moderation team at r/worldnews that has never done anything but uphold the principles Reddit was founded on - you can again direct them to the above sub which ought to be completely empty as a demonstration of how fair the moderation team at r/worldnews is.

- When you (falsely) criticize r/worldnews and somebody accuses you of using an isolated example to cast doubt on the credibility of the mods at r/worldnews and their commitment to the free flow of information - you can also link them to the above sub rather than digging for other (false) pieces of evidence.

...

##Examples of what brought this on below:


Israeli Terrorists set fire to Mosque in Palestine (removed under the pretense of being in the wrong sub, should be in the country-specific subs and for being "local crime")

http://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/2j8ak5/jewish_settlers_set_fire_to_mosque_in_palestinian/

http://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/2j8ak5/jewish_settlers_set_fire_to_mosque_in_palestinian/

Israeli Terrorists Destroy Several Palestinian Water Wells (censored under the guise of this cross border terrorism being mere "local crime")

http://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/2jdng2/israeli_settlers_damage_seven_palestinian_wells/

Shlomo Sand Criticizes Israeli Racism and Renounces his 'Jewish' Identity (removed for being "opinion analysis")

http://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/2jfj0l/shlomo_sand_i_wish_to_resign_and_cease/

These are just some of the examples over the last few days that I've seen. In each case, articles were removed under a few (generally about 3) hours.

...

##Here's an example of a Story not tied to Israel, that was rightly removed for being a local crime - given that this is what it was (Indian Farmer burns alive another Indian):

http://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/2jezyd/a_lowcaste_teenage_boy_in_india_has_been_burnt_to/

Notice the difference. It took them almost a full day to act on this clearly local crime story that built its way to the front page. Meanwhile, they deleted stories of open terrorism (in 2 of the cases near the top of this post) under the pretense of 'local crime' in less than 3 hrs. The story regarding Shlomo Sand was actually removed **while they left this particular story about an Indian crime up** - only to take it down much later.



...

##Meanwhile the following is r/WorldNews-worthy:
