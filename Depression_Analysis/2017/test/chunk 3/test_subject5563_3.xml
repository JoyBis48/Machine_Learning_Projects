	<TEXT> Personally I really loved it because it was a more personal tale for Bond as it explored his history and childhood. A sentiment that is echoed in how M says "orphans make the best agents", which kind of makes you feel for Bond since he is a fairly cold and ruthless character.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The theatrical cut glosses over or completely cuts out many key characters that are integral to the actual story. The directors cut re-inserts this aspect into the film and adds layers to the developing world around the characters as well as political story threads which establish conflicts during the film. The directors cut is a 3 hour long film while the theatrical is around 2hrs 20 minutes, which gives you an idea of just how much was cut out.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree I enjoyed the film. To be fair though, Need for Speed is probably one of the easiest games to adapt into a film since none of the games really feature an in depth narrative with fleshed out characters that are remotely memorable. So in that regard NFS was extremely easy to pull off since you only need to feature fast cars and cops.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I just checked the Ford AU site and it has this quote:

"There's a thrilling 5.0-litre V8 engine option available, but the real news is how we've unleashed Mustang-level performance from Ford's highly efficient 2.3L EcoBoost engine." 

Then it again it does say specifications will change closer to date.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think pretty much all these changes are for the best. The film ending can also be up for interpretation, while it isn't as directly sad as the book ending, it can still be sad in it's on way since film Cage may have almost fallen for Rita but due to the reset he realises that she wouldn't remember him nor fall for him.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Splitscreen is very hard to develop into a game. It requires extensive coding and testing plus it would probably add a delay to a game. Personally the amount of people who would be using split screen would be minimal and thus the effort required for the amount of people that would use it is not worth it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So I saw this for the first time a few weeks ago and I don't really know how to feel about this one. It seems like a fairly dry film but with some seemingly cool ideas and themes. The masked party in particular was very interesting and has that perfect mysterious air about the whole situation, however I just don't know how to feel about the film overall I felt kind of empty after watching it haha. What was the general consensus for this film, it being Stanley Kubricks last film as well.  </TEXT>
