	<TEXT> Honestly, I think when you're so far down you just don't know where to start, medication is the kick up you need. I still take it at the moment, but my psychologist is considering getting me off them by the end of the year.  When I started on them, it was like day and night. You wake up one morning and its like a switch. You look around and just think... "this is how normal people feel?". While I felt this, it also increased the severity of my lows (basically making me bipolar while I was on them) and it was because of this that I attempted suicide twice. The ones I'm on now (mirtazapine) are much better for me I think. The only downside is it causes difficulties downstairs - something that has caused a bit of trouble between me and my girlfriend. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I totally feel you man. It's so hard at the start, when you suddenly realize how far down you are, and the climb to the top looks so hard. It is really hard. Its all about baby steps and focusing on what you have already accomplished instead of what is yet to come, what you still have to do or what you've failed at. You've already accomplished something today by reaching out to me - my feedback and even reading your own comment can help you feel better or have a greater understanding of your situation. I never liked keeping a record of things - I used to keep a (private) blog and journal, but I found that reading over my dark thoughts actually made me feel even more depressed - I was frightened of who I was and what I was saying.

Try your best to find someone you can trust. Don't hate them if they can't understand - if you don't understand what's going on with you than there's no way they're going to. Just let them know that all you really need is someone to listen to you. That's all you need. It gets better, there's a light at the end of the tunnel etc. I know it sounds dumb and honestly, when I was at my darkest I would literally scoff at advice like the stuff I'm writing now, but its so true. You need to understand and accept that you are viewing the world incorrectly, your perceptions are altered, skewed negatively. An important thing to do is try to observe your thought process. Actually listen to what you're saying in your head, watch how you react to things. When you truly start to do this, you start to realize how irrational some of your thoughts are, and you can start to try and change them. 

Good luck, and from one human being to another, I care about you. 3 Feel free to PM me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Through the help of medication, lots and lots of therapy and hard work. The first step is, as everyone always says, reaching out. You really do need that hand up out the hole before you can start doing things on your own. Its a slow and painful process, and for me it contained many many setbacks. But I pushed on and got myself to a functioning, happy state (and consistently feeling this way!). If you haven't reached out to a family member or close friend yet, I sincerely suggest that you do. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes, I understand that, I sorta mean "I won this round" and feel ready to win all the ones that are sure to come after it. (see my above comment). Next time I hit a roadblock I feel I'll be able to deal with it much better.

edit: since I believe my depression is the chemical kind, (not due to environmental factors) I understand that it's something I'm going to have to manage for a very long time, possibly the rest of my life. I'm okay with that. </TEXT>

I'm not really all the way out of the woods just yet, but I have come so far in the last three years (had depressive symptoms for about 2 years before I was diagnosed 12 months ago) and learned so much.

	<TEXT> **Hey r/android, please be aware that OP is not talking about the Razr Maxx, but is instead talking about the newer [Razr M](http://www.gsmarena.com/motorola_razr_m-4974.php) that is coming out soon.** OP should ignore all recommendations in this thread because everyone is talking about the **Razr Maxx** - they're [two completely different phones.](http://www.gsmarena.com/compare.php3?idPhone1=4974 idPhone2=4666)

OP: The Razr M has a smaller, lower resolution screen when [compared with the Galaxy Nexus](http://www.gsmarena.com/compare.php3?idPhone1=4974 idPhone2=4219) (4.3in, 540x960 vs 4.65in, 720x1280). It has an arguably better processor and but on the software front the Galaxy Nexus will offer a *much* better experience. The Razr M has a larger battery and a smaller screen, so I think its safe to say that battery life will be less of a problem on the Razr M than the Galaxy Nexus. You must also decide whether expandable storage is important to you - Galaxy Nexus doesn't have an SD card slot while the Razr M does.

Personally, I'd go the Galaxy Nexus. Guaranteed software updates for at least the next two major versions of Android + a bigger and better resolution screen. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 100% agree with you. From a consumer perspective, its a perfect solution - in typical Apple fashion, too. Sure we can rant and rave about how non-standards-compliant or compatible it is, but at the end of the day, Apple has provided a solution to an existing problem - however limiting that solution may be. Its excellent for Apple; not so good for the rest of mobile technology. Apple has never seemed to give a fuck about anything other than profit though. This ties in perfectly with their existing vision. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Perhaps. There doesn't seem to be anything other than anecdotal evidence on the topic. Many of my friends use (or did, until they switched to iPhone) Nokias and a few have used Samsung (non-android) phones (with some sort of Java-based OS), and this problem has occurred. (In Australia, on various telcos, if that makes any difference). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Its sad how true this is. I almost feel like its an underhanded way of enticing users to buy into the platform - so many times I've seen people with Android phones receive MMSes from iPhones with this issue, they mention it to the person who sent it to them next time they see them, and the person laughs and says something along the lines "oh well, it wouldn't happen if you had an iPhone." - so people start to think its a problem with their phone, not the other way around.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You're asking the wrong questions. What do I want to eat? Yum, I feel like some mac   cheese. Who do I feel like talking to? Talk to them. Ask them how their day was. 

So maybe you cut yourself tonight - that's okay. You'll go longer without cutting next time. Put it in the past. 

Things aren't happening to throw you back into your depression - sure, it seems like that, but depression is a failure in thinking and correctly assessing situations. Your depression is overwhelming you, it is using these things that happen in your life as an excuse to get the better of you. People are shit. Its a fact. People will always fuck you over. Find people that don't and don't fuck them over either.

Is there anything specific that has made you feel this way at the moment?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Congratulations on finding a release. Now you know what helps you, the only thing you need to focus on is finding the motivation to do it when you start feeling down (I often find that's the hardest part. Doing things you know will make you feel better - sometimes you just don't want to.)

I find bike riding, playing video games and watching a particular scary movie achieves this for me. Be careful you don't cross the line into escapism though - by merely using these things as a "distraction" instead of actual stress relief, you are simply ignoring your problems and letting them get bigger. When I was really bad, I would play video games or go for a really exerting bike ride, but I would only feel better *while* I was doing these things - the second I stopped and my mind wandered from the task at hand, I immediately felt like shit.

Anyway, hope you're having a fantastic night. :) Thanks for sharing your awesome news with us. </TEXT>
