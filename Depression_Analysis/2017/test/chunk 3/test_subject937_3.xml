As a proud LGBT Southern activist (on one local board and one statewide board), South-bashing is tired and not very productive. Minimizing my experience but not that of the commenter to whom I replied is a good example of how subtle it can be.

As for relevance, I responded to an anecdote with a counter-anecdote. </TEXT>

So, yes, vote. Use the ballot box and elect your leaders.

I suggest it may be an individual thing because I love both my siblings. Were there bad blood, the desire to help their children may not be there. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Broadly, yes. But the Constitution was a refinement of the Articles of Confederation. And the Commerce Clause was specifically intended to help improve upon the Articles by giving the federal government more authority.

	<TEXT> Um, no. Way to let hyperbole completely take attention away from any validity your point may have.

The Commerce Clause + the Necessary and Proper Clause do vest the federal government with broad authority, but not absolute authority.

The intent was to give the national government a level of authority over the national economy. Naturally, if the national economy grows, so will that authority. </TEXT>

To bring up an example you used elsewhere in this thread...

There is zero practical difference between the government telling me to keep $20 more of my income and the government taxing me as usual but sending me $20. It reduces the amount of money in the government coffers exactly the same (and increase my money exactly the same).

Whatever amount of money you got to keep because you took the student loan interest deduction can just as easily be viewed as a check from the government. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Minor bump in the road. The highest court that will hear the federal case (the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals) struck down Virginia's ban.

SC officials are simply wasting time and money. It's very disingenuous for anyone with knowledge of the legal system to throw up their hands and say, "But who knows how this case will be decided".

We know exactly how it'll be decided, because the highest court that will hear the case already did. </TEXT>

Shall property owned by the University System of Georgia and utilized by providers of college and university student housing and other facilities continue to be exempt from taxation to keep costs affordable?
