	<TEXT> Haha this is a fantastic response. You hit the nail on the head with your assessment. I always prefer rye for my manhattans and scotch to sip. I'll have to think of a few more options because I'm not fond of very "sweet" whiskeys so I appreciate the direction to focus on :D </TEXT>

I've tried quite a few, but honestly ony can remember about one or two from most categories as I wasn't drinking them with the intention of selling it, heh.

	<TEXT> Hey all!

I just got a new job as a cocktail waitress at a bar specializing in whiskey/whisky... A lot of patrons will ask for suggestions on recommendations for a good bourbon/scotch/rye of varying conditions/batches/etc.

I was curious what r/whiskey thought about some solid go-to's and why.

[Here is the full spirits list for anyone curious.](http://www.saloondavis.com/documents/Saloon_Bourbon8.9.13.pdf) It changes often, so anything outside of this is encouraged, too, but try to stick to the list if you can :)

Thanks! </TEXT>

As far as customer service goes, I have that in the bag and I know I'll kill it in that department; I just need to make sure I don't fuck up my drinks!

I am going into the bar before they open today to do a little practice. I'll report back after. Thanks a bunch! </TEXT>

	<TITLE> I was potentially offered a bartending job at a very high volume whiskey/cocktail bar. I have no bartending experience (which they are aware of). Help would be appreciated! </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-04-12 11:38:04 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So, I just started a new job as a hostess at a local restaurant and not even a week in I was asked if I would be interested in cocktail waitressing. I have server experience and a really great analytical memory, so I enthusiastically agreed... Cut to yesterday, I show up for my shift and was pulled aside from the (lead?) bartender and asked if I was interested in bartending. I was honest about my lack of experience which he seemed fine with (he said he prefers training new bartenders over acclimating existing bartenders with attitudes). I am heading in on Sunday to do a little training and I'm extremely nervous. I've been in myriad positions where I've had to learn on the fly, and the staff seems to really like me here but I can't help but feel like they're insane for asking me two weeks into my new job.  
  

Any help or advice on how to kick ass and learn fast would be appreciated, along with any useful tips that any new bartender should know. There's a possibility this is just a trial run and won't end up with an actual bar position, but I want to be prepared for all possible outcomes.  
  


**TL;DR:** I was asked if I wanted to be a bartender with no previous bartending experience because my managers think I am organized and a fast learner (I presume). Please help with tips/opinions in any way!  
  

Thanks for reading :) </TEXT>
