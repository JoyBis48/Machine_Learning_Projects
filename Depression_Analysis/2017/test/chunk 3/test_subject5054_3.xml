Guerilla Maab was the 'rap group' he was in with Trae (the Truth) and their cousin Dougie D (currently serving life in prison I belive) before they both went solo. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> OK that's what I figured you were saying. And I agree, we can't lose to Portugal, a tie wouldn't be ideal but at least we'd have the goal differential buffer for our game against Germany while they'd still have to beat Ghana (assuming Ghana loses to Germany). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't really see how this is even a discussion. Unless for some reason he thinks we can compete with Germany for the 1 seed? Ideal outcome for the weekend - Germany wins vs. Ghana, US wins vs. Portugal. That gives both the US and Germany 6 points putting both teams through. If Ghana beats Germany and we beat Portugal then, like you said, there are 3 teams vying for 2 spots in the last game instead of 2 teams in (assuming US and Germany W). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't really see how that would be all that beneficial. The more intersecting thoroughfares you have, the more 4-way stops and stop lights you need - this is bad.

I think the solution will be more 'science' than 'structure'. Mandated staggered business hours to lighten the rush that is rush hour, better light timing, emphasis on, implantation of and general acceptance and use of quality mass transit, better pedestrian options, better driving culture, the rise of driverless cars, etc.

Many small, subtle changes can add up to very noticeable gains. 

 Of course, it would require us to sacrifice certain quaint values about quiet, empty suburban streets, but oh well. This is Houston. The city proper. If you want quiet suburban streets, move to Katy.

And no, I don't want to sacrifice the small amount of pedestrian friendly areas for something that there is no basis or evidence that it works. (unless there is which I'd be interested in reading)

Buy up houses that are in the way via eminent domain, bulldoze them, and build connections in there place. This would help immensely with traffic at a fraction of the price of building new highways.

Easy to say until your house is on the chopping block. Also, this would not be cheap. Imminent domain acquisition is expensive and time consuming. Roads aren't cheap. Bridges aren't cheap. Restructuring intersections (where do we add stop lights? where do we add stop signs? where do we create 4 way stops?) to take on the added weight of new thoroughfare traffic can't be easy. </TEXT>

over and over. Rockets fans are human and sometimes it gets to us. I try not to let it get to me but I'll be honest, sometimes it does and sometimes I miss when the Rockets were everyone's favorite little team a couple seasons ago.

	<TEXT> A couple decades was the amount of time it took to go from the first production of the V2 rocket to the first man in orbit. 20 years is a long time. Obviously dominoes need to fall in place: the right people have to be born; and the right system has to be in place with the support of mentors, coaches, facilities and culture. To act like it's unfeasible is just pessimistic shortsightedness. Obviously it's arrogance to think that it *will happen* because *America*, but it's nothing more than optimism to hope for it to happen. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Why? He's from Canada, but has a tattoo representing his love for the city. He reps us hard. He considers us his second home. He loves Houston and considers himself a "Houston-mentored rapper". You should love the fact that someone with the pull of Drake reps so hard for a town he has no roots in. He gives us more national exposure than most of our homegrown guys (Bun B excluded - DJ Screw is legend status but outside of Houston and HH he is non-existent - Mike Jones was a cruel joke - Z-Ro, KeKe, ESG, wreckshop family, etc. all have in-state pull but that's about it).

I think the bit about any monies received must be used for wetlands protection supports this.

Klinnsman was hired on his credentials. Klinnsman slams Kobe for being extended on his credentials. Wilbon slams Klinnsman for hypocrisy.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That was his point though. He got a contract to be coach based on his past actions, then he went and criticized Kobe Bryant for getting a contract based on his past actions.

He conveyed the point with absolutely no tact but I think that was what he was saying. </TEXT>

Then he got fired.

	<TEXT> If I remember correctly Ronaldo promptly scored after this. Pretty sure it was in stoppage time or close to 90 minutes.

So no, probably not worth it. They lost, he lost his job, he probably fired up Ronaldo which resulted in the goal.

	<TEXT> She is probably my least favorite casting on the show so far. I think the actress who played Ros would have been absolutely perfect for Shae and would have been a much better match personality wise with Tyrion. In that universe I wouldn't mind her taking the place of Penny. Gonna be interesting casting Penny though, are there any female dwarf actresses? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> See man, that's what you people just don't fucking get. I don't spend 15 hours a day on the internet but I see my fair share, and I've managed to never see this. You might have seen it 15 times, but this was my first.

Sometimes shit just slips through the cracks and you miss something. The simple enormity of the internet and all the content within is impossible for a single person to completely digest in *their lifetime* let alone the relative short amount of time that the internet has been churning out this content.

With that in mind, try to visualize all the stuff that you see for the first time that someone else has seen 15 times. Imagine trying to talk about it and the conversation revolves around the fact that it's "*a fuckin repost man*"

It's annoying. If you have seen something a billion times, what force drives you to go into the comments to let people know that you've seen it before?

I just picture you people in the real world, listening to someone tell a story that you'd already heard before.

"So there I was, sitting on the bench minding my own business when out of nowhe..."

"Dude, wtf, repost! you told this story already."

"Oh ya I did tell you! Sorry mate, but Patricia here hasn't heard it so I'm gonna keep going."

"Fuck Patricia, provide new content and stop being such a story whore"

"Fine... So there I was, sitting on the camel, minding my own busine..."

Patricia speaks up, "I've heard this, one stop telling it!"

e: i mean you're pretty chill about it but damn it's annoying when people act like they're above the repost

	<TEXT> Yeah when I was talking about vicinity to the light rail I meant Midtown. I do walk from the rail to my apt in montrose (Westheimer and Montrose abouts) every day after work and I don't think it's far (though it's starting to turn into a sweaty walk). I walk wayyyyy more than the average Houstonian to be fair.

There are a few bus routes that will take you there a lot quicker but I prefer the walk after work; gets my blood pumping a little. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Midtown sounds ideal, shouldn't be too difficult to find a place for $1,000, though might be a little more for the "perfect" spot. There are plenty of places that are pet friendly, but be prepared to pay an extra deposit for large breed. Midtown's population is predominantly young business types between 24-35, has quality night life, is about as central as you can get, it's close to downtown and the light rail (though fairly limited use depending on where your office is located).

Might also want to check out Montrose, there's a ton of large complexes going up and being finished right now. Montrose is just south of Midtown for an idea of the area.

The place you have in your post is pretty much right in between the two (Saint Danes is a great bar if you end up there - only a couple blocks away - and they're dog friendly). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sorry but that HEB is not only a better grocery store, but also a much better looking building and space. Love that they kept the big oak tree up in the parking lot. The high rise that's going up where fiesta once stood... now that is another matter.

Not really sure what would satisfy you if you can't find a bar in montrose that caters to your type of people. Yuppie bars, bro bars, hipster bars, gay bars, dive bars, cocktail bars, etc. etc., pick your poison. Also still an abundance of smaller retail outlets (which are seemingly popping up faster than your chains).
