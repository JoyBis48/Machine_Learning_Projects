	<TEXT> Hey guys. I think we can ask agree we're ready for winter already. With that being said I need new boots. To be honest I've done zero research so any opinions would be fine. I'm looking for a durable but comfortable style. If you like your boots par tell me what they are. Thanks so much fellas </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey Nathan I am a huge fan and I've seen every episode. 

I just want to ask about the girl Rachel. Is that actually how she is or do you exaggerate the awkwardness for the camera? Also when you get her for more than one segment (The Hunk and Quiznos) doesn't she start to ham it up a little too?

Thanks for doing this. Favorite show on television
