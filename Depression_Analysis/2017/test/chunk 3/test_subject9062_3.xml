	<TEXT> Couldn't agree more. The gunners in the US are killing this amendment by defending the current abysmal regulations situation; if, after a child is murdered in a massacre with a gun at school, the NRA folks came out with humanity and attempted to fix the loopholes and prevent such tragedies, I think people (me included) would relax . But instead they get more vicious; the things said to the parents of Sandy Hook victims were FUCKED.  </TEXT>

If its the latter, the legal owner could face charges if he or she knew the gun had been taken and failed to report it to police. </TEXT>

If someone has their passport taken away, and then voila has a firearm and bullets, the FIRST QUESTION should be how? Where did he get them?

It seems like a diploma-mill situation, where the teacher trainings bring in more money than classes, so teachers ALL seem to offer them, and then turn out new teachers like crazy. Odds are, even if most new instructors are good ones, we will end up with more and more freaks. OP, your instructor sounds like s/he's got a tin ear.  </TEXT>
