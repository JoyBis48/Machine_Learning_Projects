	<TEXT> Here's another morsel for thought: Hong Kong has massive demonstrations every year (especially on Tiananmen), but China lets them do it. Do you really think they would even try to stop them in 30 years when the "50 year limit" is up? Massive demonstrations would ensue and the Chinese government will lose its legitimacy. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't think this really matters in the long term. Hong Kong's cultural identity is independence. You'd have to kill off generations of native Hong Kongers for them to lose it. Even migrant workers move there because of the opportunity and because it's "not China". The second they try to erase that from Hong Kong is the moment they lose legitimacy in the eyes of the people. You'll see mass demonstrations and civil unrest, which the Chinese government does not want and would not be able to control in the mass media.

Simply put, China is deathly allergic to civil unrest, and there is no way to completely impose Communist rule without creating utter chaos in the region. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Stimulating the immune system is going to be one of the big things in the coming years.

Here's an amazing result presented at ASCO with pembrolizumab, which helps to re-activate the immunity-based antitumor system: http://www.ascopost.com/ViewNews.aspx?nid=16291. My impression is that these types of drugs are probably broadly applicable and could become standard of care for all patients. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think it really depends on what Boehner's (and the future whip's) goals are -- whether it is to maintain establishment control of the House or to win the national election. The facts are that many primary challenges from the Tea Party already come from solid Republican states that would not affect the result of the national election. However, moderate reforms like immigration overhaul can be forced through an non-election year like 2015 while maintaining the Hastert rule. These types of actions can pull many of the slightly left-leaning purple states back into play. Even though Democrats are going to get pummeled in 2014, they currently have a massive structural advantage in winning the national election (with or without Clinton). The establishment Republicans know this, and the question is whether they are willing to sacrifice a significant amount of house seats in order to survive nationally.

Personally, I don't think Boehner or any high-level politician really gives a shit about some random House member who is afraid of actually having to campaign hard for their seat. What they might anticipate is that by passing bills that are more moderate, they can also win House seats in purple districts to buffer any new Tea Party members that may get elected. It would come out even in the end, and the Republican Party would have a net gain in their White House chances. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The issue is that for decades (even in the 90s and 2000s!), a college degree statistically led to much higher future incomes -- much more so than a 2-year or vocation. The problem is that the recession in the late 2000s caused an unemployment shock, and created scars in companies where they are less likely to take someone who is "green". The student loan thing was never a problem given a decent job, but wage stagnation coupled with reticient hiring has made the problem really bad. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You should qualify that statement with: good schools without significant financial aid.

There are many elite schools that pile on the aid in terms of housing and tuition. Princeton undergrad is free. Harvard is free if your family makes less than 80k, and then it's a VERY modest percentage of family income. On the flip side, there are plenty of elite liberal arts colleges and public universities that don't have competitive financial aid packages, and that's where you will see increasing numbers of rich folk (because everyone else can't afford it). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The only problem is that seeding guts with genetically modified bacteria has never been done and is probably going to have a hard time at the FDA. Theoretically you could functionally cure type I diabetes by engineering E. coli to express recombinant insulin with specific molecular triggers (eg. some kind of sugar alcohol or drug inducer) and have it live in the gut. Many types of insulin on the market today are recombinant, so it's not a matter of capability -- it's a matter of the FDA flipping its shit when you produce a "living medicine". </TEXT>

One day you eat normally, and the second day you basically just skip breakfast and have a small lunch. People who were put on that regimen were able to keep on it longer, and they actually ate less on their normal days! Those people said that they got used a larger "range" of what hunger felt like, so small pangs no longer lead to binge eating. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Here is the magical coffee maker that will beat anything you get out of a college coffee shop: http://www.amazon.com/Melitta-Ready-Single-Coffee-Brewer/dp/B0014CVEH6/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8 qid=1401696468 sr=8-1 keywords=melitta+coffee+cone

Buy a large airtight mason jar and store your coffee in a cool dark place. Get some nice beans and pregrind them to a "Melitta" grain size, which is very fine. You might think I'm crazy for suggesting pre-grind, but the fact is that (a) you will be going through the beans quickly, and (b) any decent grinder you buy will be very expensive and won't match an industrial grinder's evenness or quality. I have never noticed any difference in quality from preground beans that were stored for a few weeks.

Get a water kettle and a measuring spoon. Tailor the amount of grounds you add in to your taste. I usually do 3 tbsp for a cup of coffee. You'll need the #2 filters from Trader Joe's.

Edit: also, don't get a porcelain coffee cone unless you like wasting your time heating it up. </TEXT>

Similarly, a lot of popular fruits were made by grafting plants on each other. That never occurs in nature.

	<TEXT> You forget corn. Its ancestral forms were so WTF that I'm surprised Native Americans kept it around for that long.

In terms of modern (eg. 20th century) science, people "created" new strains by mutagenesis. They would literally bombard crops with UV/gamma radiation, plant them in fields exposed to the environment, and see what came out. For those who are worried about health and environmental concerns, this is far more risky. But of course, the USDA approved these foods rather than the FDA. For some reason, whole-scale genetic changes are OK but changing/inserting several genes is not.

We have the power of hindsight to show that broad-scale/coarse mutagenesis methods are safe. Nobody ever seriously thought that this would be dangerous to the public. While the safety concern in GMO food is strain-specific, we should treat it with appropriate and proportional scrutiny, not hysteria. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In addition to the neat drugs coming out (especially imatinib for CML comes to mind), cancer can be curative if it is caught very early and is in an organ amenable to surgery. If you can take it out before it metastasizes, in many cases the cancer is eliminated. Things like early stage colorectal cancer comes to mind (get your screenings done!). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The stupid thing was that the new Google Maps was not "feature complete" until much later. Off the top of my head I can't think of anything new in Google Maps that blows the old one out of the water. Take Google Hangouts too, for example. In most cases it is 99% the same as Google Talk. It took them over a year to even get any kind of reasonable unified messaging going on. The first few versions were so goddamn slow for no reason. Now they finally have a version that works better but drains battery life. It's as if they can't help but break the wheel. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think part of their strategy now is to iterate quickly and accordingly make small batches of the units so they won't run into a Surface 1 debacle. Sell them at a loss/break even but refresh them quickly to keep up with the tech news cycle and build up to what consumers want. Honestly, by doing this they get a lot of goodwill from the tech crowd. It shows that they are actually listening to complaints and addressing them in later releases. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My favorite example was how imatinib (Gleevec) was invented. The hurdle wasn't due to a lack of knowledge -- we knew the structure of the site to target -- but rather the most difficult part was to convince Novartis to take the risk with a Phase I clinical trial. What we really lack is the capability to test the effectiveness of drugs in vivo on a massive scale. There are tons of molecules where we see a significant "biological" effect, but we have no way to screen for their bioavailability or in vivo effects without going into an animal model. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> With regards to nutrition, I think you are perpetuating a myth that we "don't have a handle" on it. It is quite the contrary -- we know the vast majority of risky lifestyles that substantially reduce lifespan and increase death rate. The medical literature is quite conclusive and is muddied by fad diets and lifestyles, The rest regarding antioxidants and vitamins, are indeed "dotting the is and crossing the ts" so to speak. The factors with the largest effect size and statistical significance have been solved for decades. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think the outcome depends on the restaurant. Certainly this law wouldn't make a difference for downscale places where tips aren't gratuitous. However this would effectively reduce the number of people who would want to work at a high-end restaurant, because the obscene tips effectively bumps them up to a higher pay grade. What is eventually going to happen is that the high-end restaurant itself is going to have to start offering higher wages in order to attract staff, which means higher upfront prices on the menu.

Personally, I think it all comes out even, but the major difference in the previous case is that the tips all go to the service staff anyway (and maybe people behind the scenes too) -- that kind of income is often protected against the business owner. In this new case, the restaurant pockets the increase in prices and doles out what would be the lowest effective wage that the high-end restaurant labor market would bear. In this scenario, there's a chance that business owners can end up making a nice chunk of money and screwing the staff because there's no such thing as a food service sector union to negotiate fair wages. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Your friend is missing a crucial point though -- you can't make blanket statements about medicines, since their mechanisms of action are so disparate. You have salicylic acid and artemesinin, two plant-derived drugs that are first-line use, but you also have a ton of other plant-derived molecules that can't be used in people without significant modification. These kinds of generalized statements about drugs and medicines are unfortunately convenient because they don't require much critical thought, but the fact is that you have to look at everything on a case by case basis. 

Add onto that the **type of knowledge** that we have is very different today then it was back then. There's still a lot to be discovered and a lot of uncertainty, but it is not in the same areas as 50-400 years ago. We are capable of more critical thinking today than in the entire history of civilization, so it's not useful at all to generalize. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Doubt it. The reason why drugs in the first half of the 20th century was that people knew very little about organic chemistry and how drugs interacted with the body. We're in the age of molecular medicine, so many drugs that are discovered today will probably stick around for a long time. What we are lacking today is very different from back then. Today, drug development is more of a lack of capability than a lack of knowledge.  </TEXT>
