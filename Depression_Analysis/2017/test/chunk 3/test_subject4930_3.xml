	<TEXT> I truly hope i never see flying mounts in WildStar. As a long time WoW player, before flying mounts were introduced, traveling was exciting! You had to be careful not to aggro mobs or perhaps fight your way through areas, you got to see other players along the way and see the monsters they were fighting, you had to meander your way through the environment and sometimes you'd discover hidden, tucked away NPCs and villages you never knew existed before. It made the game feel alive!

Once flying mounts were added the game felt so stale when traveling, you saw a few mountains and poorly rendered villages below that you quickly glided over in a straight line, trying to get from A to B in the fastest way possible. It was boring!

So please Carbine, never add flying mounts, keep traveling as fun as possible. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I feel like the questing would be amazing if they just added more voice acting, problem is that's expensive. Wonder if there are any voice actors who're fans of WildStar and would do it for free :P I know i certainly would. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Anyone else had the annoying ult bug(?) where you're chancing an enemy and you go to cast your ult but because of the cast time you end up stopping, the enemy walks out of range and the ult never goes off, so end up stutter stepping? Has made me quite tempted to run move speed quints on her xD </TEXT>
