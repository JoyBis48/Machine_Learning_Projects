	<TEXT>  If I can still affect it after you've already collapsed the measurement, that would seem problematic, especially if "you" and "I" refer to things the size of people.

But "I" and "You" can't communicate with each other. As far as I'm concerned, you haven't collapsed yet and are in a superposition.

You raise a good point that this may set a lower bound on how large superpositions can grow before they collapse; of course in non-Copenhagen interpretations this is irrelevant. I don't think this experiment proved it in anything near the size of a person, though.

I think defining "observer" is still an outstanding problem, but I'm just a layman. Do you know of any decent not-too-technical descriptions available about the progress of figuring out "what causes the collapse" so to speak?

I'm also a laymen, but try https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/9857/what-is-an-observer-in-quantum-mechanics and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_(quantum_physics). </TEXT>

I didn't actually make any claims about rights, but here you go:

http://definitions.uslegal.com/i/implied-admission/

Tell me cops/FBI aren't sometimes untrustworthy, crooked, and famously fraternal, that media doesn't get it wrong like when they posted a front page picture of a high school athlete and his track coach under a screaming headline labeling them the Boston bombers.

Nothing I've said implies that the media don't get things wrong; I feel strongly the opposite of that view.

Give me a reason why lawyers, judges, cops themselves, constitutional rights organizations, and your mom last night say the smartest, safest action to take when you're in trouble with cops is never talk to cops.

There are several reasons, but this is irrelevant; the silence here was in an interview to the media, not to the police.

I don't hate cops (for reference, I full on hate you), but I won't put my trust in them to act in my interest.

If you're going around hating random people on the internet for disagreeing with you, you might have some problems.

You can't be this dumb, this naive.

The statements you're implicitly attributing to me are not my opinion. You've used several strawmen in this discussion, which tells me you don't have a clear understanding of the situation here, or are deliberately misleading to make points. </TEXT>
