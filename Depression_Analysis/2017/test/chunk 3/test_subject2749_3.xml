	<TEXT> This is the revival of the Vice City let's play on my channel. Hope you enjoy it and if you wanna see more feel free to leave some support with a like, comment or subscribe. Or if you feel so inclined, feedback. I am still trying to change the layout of my outro's to have video play on them instead of a still image. Thanks. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AE1fVFfmHu8 </TEXT>
