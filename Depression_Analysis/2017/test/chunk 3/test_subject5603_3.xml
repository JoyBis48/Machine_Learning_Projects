	<TEXT> Despite the conflicting nature of these left and right analyses, there is a strong case to be made that they are, in fact, complementary and that they reinforce each other. What if we put it together this way? Automation, foreign competition and outsourcing lead to a decline in well-paying manufacturing jobs, which, in turn, leads to higher levels of unemployment and diminished upward mobility, which then leads to fewer marriages, a rise in the proportion of nonmarital births, increased withdrawal from the labor force, impermanent cohabitation and a consequent increase in dependence on government support. The major roadblock to synthesizing competing explanations has been  and continues to be  political polarization. Vested interests on the left and right have delayed, and in some cases prevented, recognition of the overlap between liberal and conservative hypotheses, and have pointedly ignored evidence that contradicts their preconceived partisan positions.

Most of what you need to know about the causes poverty in America and our inability to reduce it in a few sentences.

Ryan professed not to know the price of the wine, and one of his buddies responded to Feinberg's chastisement by loudly saying, "Fuck her," Feinberg told TPM.

Ryan is a guy who complains about the lack of civility in politics and public life.  But when he had an opportunity to correct one of his buddies, appears he didn't step up. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The fourth view, closest to my own, is that the problem is fundamentally one of economics and economic history: Having been formally shut out of much of the economy until within recent memory, African Americans simply lag behind the average. The relatively fast economic advancement of other minority groups, such as Vietnamese immigrants, does not negate that premise: The history and position of black Americans is fundamentally different from that of immigrant groups. American institutions expended a great deal of effort to help assimilate and advance Vietnamese refugees, while many of those institutions had spent a solid century after the Civil War working to prevent the assimilation and advancement of African Americans.

I'm rather surprised to see a paragraph like this in the National Review.  I wonder how many of Williamson's fellow conservatives agree with it. Not many, I'd think. </TEXT>

A large percentage of the population would  have few opportunities and no meaningful civil rights, there would be  a relatively small middle class, and with most of the wealth concentrated in a few hands. Sort of like the South until the 1970's.  The liberal side likely evolve into a society more like Canada or Northern European states.   In international affairs, I would expect the conservative nation to be isolationist or belligerent and xenophobic, or more likely alternate between the two.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As John Stuart Mill, the British political economist, argued, people should be free to do as they please, provided they dont cause undue harm to others. But greenhouse gases have already caused great harm and threaten much worse. Mills cost-benefit framework provides no reason for thinking that someones freedom to escape the small burden of CO2 taxation should trump other, vastly more important freedoms. To the contrary, he said, restrictions on individual liberty are needed when the health and safety of the great mass of people and the purity of the natural environment are at stake.

It makes good economic sense to be a climate change denier if you're a heavy CO2 user or producer. If you argue that the problem doesn't exist, you can't be harming anyone else, and you don't need to pay to clean up your messes. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I wasn't commenting on the on the proposal, but on Ryan's veracity. It seems to me that people who I've found to be dishonest tend to stay dishonest (and I don't care if you're talking about finance , romance or politics), and you should look at any proposal from such people skeptically. Perhaps you've had better experiences with reformed prevaricators than I have.    But turning to the proposal itself, I'm surprised by how much there is to like in it. Lower incarceration rates and increasing the EIC for childless adults, if it were any Republican but Paul Ryan suggesting this, he'd be getting jumped on for having become a squishy moderate.  There are also a number of dubious ideas, such as replacing programs with block grants to local governments.  I would imagine that places like Minnesota and Nebraska we'd see well run programs with impartial administrators, and in places like Chicago and Louisiana you'll see the grants abused for political favoritism, if not actually stolen.  There's also one genuinely laughable idea, life coaches.  We've had 'life coaches' for the poor since Jane Adams' Hull House, except for they're called social workers.  Relabeling them life coaches isn't going to make it any easier to transform people's lives. But here's the real problem with Ryan's plan.  Do you see any discussion about the change in [ income distribution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Household_income_in_the_United_States )   in the United States over the last 50 years?  In fact, hit crtl-F, type in distribution and see how many times and where the word turns up.    How can you claim to be discussing 'Opportunity in America' and how government programs have failed  to end poverty and ignore the fact that the income of the lowest quintile has fallen so greatly compared to everyone else?  Perhaps the problem isn't really the personal pathologies among the poor, or the ineffectiveness of government programs, but a increasingly unfair economic system.  I suspect that Ryan doesn't want that discussion started, so he's hiding the ball here. Its just his latest in his long line of distortions ,dissemblings and dishonesties.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> But where Ryan and others get it wrong is in their pervasive assumption that all you have to do to get a job is want a job. In this regard, here is what you need to know about work requirements: in the absence of strong labor demand, such requirements are a recipe for more, not less, poverty.

Why is it so hard to understand?  Do conservatives think the unemployment rate went from 4.7% in January 2006 to 9.7% in January 2011 because Americans became lazier and less willing to work over those 5 years? </TEXT>

It has demonstrated its essential worthlessness. It has demonstrated that it has the moral character of a sea-slug and the professional conscience of the Treponema pallidum spirochete. Trust me.

WASHINGTON  It was one of the final pieces of legislation **signed into law by President George W. Bush**, a measure that passed without controversy, along with a pension bill and another one calling for national parks to be commemorated on quarters.  This is a piece of legislation were very proud to sign, a White House spokesman, Tony Fratto, told reporters on Dec. 23, 2008, as the president put his pen to the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008, named for a 19th-century British abolitionist. This program has been very effective around the world in trying to stop trafficking in persons.
