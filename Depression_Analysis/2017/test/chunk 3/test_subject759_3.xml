	<TEXT> the question is: what was it used for??

but really i think its fair to use a washcloth with soap to wash your body, i'm sure i know people who do that. I remember thats how we showered when we were kids, but i personally havent used a washcloth in years. straight up soap to skin all the way! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> ...is it? i feel like things like winters are cold enough to freeze things... 

although actually i guess the cold beverage may only count as "nice" if you are drinking it while you are very hot, which maybe requires electricity, so since then, sure i could see that. </TEXT>

here's an idea; lets give drunk people tiny razor sharp objects and encourage them to throw them around the bar. 
great work, everyone!
