	<TEXT> 1. **Annie Hall - Woody Allen - 1977**: The greatest comedy ever made, was masterfully composed by its nonlinear storytelling, and the disappointing and undramatic ending hit harder because it made the movie feel so much more grounded in reality despite its hyper-exaggerated quirkiness. Also, just plain goddamn hilarious.

2. **The Godfather parts I and II - Francis Ford Coppola - 1972, 74**: The greatest story ever told in American cinema. While the writing, acting, cinematography, are all near-perfect; the biggest mark is the elegance with which Michael Corleon's transformation is shown. No mafia film since has gone by without avoiding the shadow of this movie's legacy.

3. **North By Northwest - Hitchcock - 1959**: it feels like it was the precursor to the Bond films, but with Hitchcock quality direction. It is the both the essential action movie, and the essential mistaken identity movie.

4. **Barry Lyndon - Kubrick - 1975**: Almost every single scene takes on an otherworldly characteristic with the incredibly beautiful shots of the European countryside. 

5. **Once Upon A Time In The West - Sergio Leone - 1968**: This was the ultimate spaghetti western director at the height of his power. In my (unpopular) opinion, it has both a superior soundtrack and a more mature story than The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly.

6. **There Will Be Blood - P.T. Anderson - 2007**: a performance for the ages by DDL, masterful direction by Anderson, ripe with symbolism and analytically dense. It's a modern day wet dream for movie lovers.

7. **2001: A Space Odyssey - Kubrick - 1968**: I could talk about this movie for hours. It has so many thematic layers hidden behind an extraordinary depiction of space and a brilliantly anthropomorphized robot antagonist. 

8. **Apocalypse Now - Coppola - 1979**: One of the most deep and fascinating explorations of human psychology through the medium of a war, conveyed through an Odyssey-esque journey.

9. **Lawrence Of Arabia - David Lean - 1962**: This is the definitive hollywood epic. The grandiosity is complemented by such a stark contrast in the humane and relatable personal struggle. This is what a 'blockbuster' should be.

10. **Who's Afraid Of Virginia Woolf? - Mike Nichols - 1966**: there's something sharp and gripping and poignant about the dialogue in this movie. It rips into your soul and surfaces again for air over and over again for 2 hours.

And I really, really, really wanted to put Fargo, Manhattan, It happened one night, and the LOTR trilogy. Ten just isn't enough :( </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Fuck my life. 

Even if Orlando was going for full on tank-and-rebuild; we could have and should have done a hell of a lot better than Mo Harkless as our young talent acquisition; and we should have found a way to acquire better draft picks than 2017-lottery-protected first rounders. Orlando unequivocally loses huge, no matter which way you look at it. 

Our lineup going into this season looks something like Jameer-Affalo/Redick-Hedo-Big Baby-Gustavo Ayon; with Vucavic, Harkless, Nicholson, and whatever point guard we sign coming off the bench. It's going to be a depressing stretch of 18-28 win seasons for the magic going forward. </TEXT>

I have this heartbreaking feeling we're going to anomalously be ravaged by injuries/off the field issues for the second season in a row, finish something like 10-3, be ranked in the high-teens, and considered a huge disappointment again.




Okay. So that's probably a bit panicky. I'm just ready for the season to start.  </TEXT>

1. Something you're interested in doing, given the very high likelihood of deciding not to go to law school

2. Something that will allow you to maintain the highest gpa possible. Think 3.9-4.0

Depending on your interests, you might be forced to pick one of the two. But if you want to go to law school, having an absurdly high GPA is *enormously* helpful.

	<TEXT> Let A connote "eating a butterfinger" and B represent "you are thirsty." the first part of the statement is simplified to "if A, then B" and the only other logical statement we can create from that is the contrapositive "If not B, then not A" which would expand to "If you are not thirsty, then you did not eat a butterfinger."

So your friend's statement rephased: "if B, then A" does not logically follow from "If A, then B"; is sound logic and he should be congratulated. </TEXT>

When someone says "I'm not going to be able to pick up that rock," "I'll try to pick up that rock," and "I'm going to pick up that rock," they're still going to try to pick up that rock in all three scenarios. The middle one is just a neutral statement of fact without a predictive assertion.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 2. Can you cite a source then? Do you see how the second sentence doesn't logically validate the first?

5. If you're making an argument against the death penalty, it seems fair to have complaints that are narrowly tailored against the death penalty; and not broad problems with the entire justice system.

7. Spread out across the nation? That's really not much at all, and that amount would likely be doing nothing right now other than easing municipal and state budget crises to a very small degree.

	<TEXT> Magic had already been retired for a full year when he was on the Dream Team. Bird's back was going out and he was a year away from retiring as well. Either way, that shouldn't shock you for rebounds because  Charles Barkley was a considerably better rebounder than any of the three, which makes sense because he was a power forward and they were a shooting guard, point guard, and small forward respectively. 

Points/steals is still legitimately surprising, but not entirely when you consider that all-star teams tend to lead to historically wonky results; especially with such a high random chance of variation (from such a small set of games). Take for instance the [box score](http://www.usabasketball.com/misc/12_mnt_exh_05_box.pdf) of the latest game between USA and Spain. Carmelo led the team in points despite the fact that he was 6th in the league in [points-per-game](http://espn.go.com/nba/statistics/player/_/stat/scoring-per-game/sort/avgPoints/year/2012/seasontype/2) and all five players in front of him were also on the roster.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Your second point doesn't logically follow- It's very possible that it is a deterrent, and is preventing an even *higher* rate of murder. States could 

Your fifth point seems moot because that's true for minorities across just about all non-white collar crimes. So it will only naturally extend.

Your seventh point is just kind of silly because the number of executions multiplied by the difference in cost between a life sentence and a death penalty is negligible compared to just about any program that could create real societal change.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> ehhhhh. I think you'd be stupid to say he doesn't even have an argument for top-10 all time, but I don't think he's "easily" top-10. For instance, you could very well make a convincing (or at least, a respectable) argument that 1. Jordan 2. Kareem 3. Wilt 4. Russell 5. Magic 6. Bird 7. Shaq 8. Tim Duncan 9. Oscar Robinson 10. Hakeem 11. Lebron James 12. Karl Malone are better than him on the all time list right now.

I do think he's a top-10 all time player, but you can't deny there's a certain subjectivity to it; and Kobe could definitely be excluded from that top 10 amongst the wiggle room. I could see him being anywhere from 7th to 13th. </TEXT>
