	<TEXT> After watching this movie I did some research about it. Some people actually believe the demon travels through pictures of the box. I read about people warning others to stop sharing the image, because even looking at it can act as a "portal" for lack of a better term. I just thought it was interesting.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It happens to me rather frequently. My first experience with sleep paralysis happened when I was around 6 or 7. I remember "waking up" and feeling very threatened (I apologize for the lack of detail as I was very young). As the feeling progressed, I tried calling out to my brother with whom I shared the room with. I immediately realized that my screams for help were inaudible. Soon after I tried sitting up with no avail. I was lying there helpless, mute, and temporarily paralyzed. It was one of the more frightening experiences of my life at the time. The next vivid case occurred about a year and a half ago. I was asleep, facing my girlfriend when I "woke up" again. This time my sleeping girlfriend's eyes opened slowly and her face became very dark. At this point I realized I was paralyzed again, and this was about the point where the panic set in. She then began to mumble quietly, yet aggressively in an incomprehensible manner (think of a double-voice synonymous with demons? . I felt an immense pressure on my neck as if I was begin stranged. This sensation lasted roughly 15 seconds and abrubtly ended when my paralysis ended, and my girlfriend smiled at me and rolled back over. After doing some research I found out that it happens to people who are under a lot of stress. I am currently an engineering student and know that I am always under a large amount of stress and anxiety.  </TEXT>
