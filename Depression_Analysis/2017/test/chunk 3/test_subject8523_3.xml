	<TEXT> Well not really, she is a very smart, kind, quite science/law uni student, and too be honest very new too dating, she has never had a boyfriend isint one too hook up at clubs virgin but still she is a lovely lady.

I on the other hand am your common no uni get straight into work whatever go's kind of guy, I met her at a party last week we've been talking ever since, we really get along.

And so I asked her out on a date (in 2 days) we are going to go to this local trendy bar, she has never been there and I use too work there, so knowing everyone there will make me look more like a badass, 
I plan to take her to the beach after that and be all romantic look at the stars but I don't know if I should kiss her or invite her back to my house compliment her buy her a flower pick her up or meet her there, usually I don't date really nice girls like this and I really want to give this one hell of a go, any advice guys?
