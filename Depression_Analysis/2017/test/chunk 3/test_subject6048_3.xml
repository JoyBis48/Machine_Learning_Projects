	<TEXT> I'm calling this now, and I hope I'm wrong, but I'm worried they're going to screw up the scene of Tyrion strangling Shea.

Either it won't happen at all, or it'll be a lot more tame. Seems like something the producers would deem "too brutal" for one of the show's hero's to do. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I realize requesting a suggestion like this is a reach, but I can't help trying to scratch this itch. Recently re-watched the film Eyes Wide Shut, and was curious why I hadn't heard of a book which was similar. This seems like such an intriguing topic to me. I know there are many mystery/crime novels set in New York City, but I'm looking for something that focuses more on "high society" so to speak.

To my knowledge it isn't a sever injury. If it's your first year and you're not that comfortable make trades, place him on your league's trading block and let the offers come to you. Any offer you get you can consult with this subreddit and typically get good advice. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I chuckled solemnly, whilst shaking my near perfect visage at the panel of self-proclaimed specialists, "The decision, my fellow mortals, falls into your laps, not mine."

The stirs of uneasiness crept along the semi circle of listeners in waves, from those dimwitted enough to have to think on my words and those who already shared my thoughts.

I smiled. An amused, sardonic, smile, one the writers of this moment would most assuredly classify as evil.
The panel speaker cleared his throat, "Could you expand on that response a bit, Sir?"

A cigarette of some sort would certainly make this upcoming monologue of mine more dramatic. I sighed, regretfully. "You see, gentleman and gentleladies, you look upon the most cutting edge technology produced by the natural phenomena known as evolution. This is what the new human looks like as we stare straight ahead into the brittle future of humanity. You ask me to sacrifice myself. In order to save those that must be left behind simply do to the natural order of humanity. You ask to stunt the growth of evolution, in order to selfishly save yourselves from your DNA-ordained fates. Now, I could fall onto my instinct of self preservation in order to justify my refusal, but it would be disingenuous to lie to the lesser breed like that. The moral quandary you see, is not mine, but yours. Will our society allow you to murder every evolutionary breakthrough our species has in order to preserve the flawed masses?"

My mouth held a taste of metallic and hot blood. I craved the cigarette now not for vanity's sake but to cover the death which permeated my glands. The stares that met my eyes, and the stares which gazed deep into the future had already answered the question. And I amazed myself at how instantly arrogance can transform into fear. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> At some point the articles coming out aren't going to be discussing how it can be fixed, but rather when we should accept it's doom. Final Fantasy is dead. It isn't the same people that made these games, it's not that same power company that was churning out all those gems of games in the late 90s. Obviously opinion matters a great deal here. If you're somebody who loved playing XIII, that's awesome and I'm happy for you- just keep in mind that it's not 'Final Fantasy' by the standard they set long ago. So many of the 'positive' comments I read about the game are "I didn't mind it", "I thought it was pretty good"- a Final Fantasy game should make you stop playing for a moment and say, "This is amazing". </TEXT>
