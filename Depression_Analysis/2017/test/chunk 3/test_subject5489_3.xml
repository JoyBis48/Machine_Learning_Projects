	<TEXT> They could implement dogs on to those farms. Such as the [Anatolian shepherd](http://www.dogwork.com/anatolian-shepherd-cheetah) that has been used in Botswana and South Africa to protect cattle and sheep from cheetahs. These are centuries old techniques that absolutely work.

Wolves were here first. We have to manage our resources responsively. That includes hunting, preservation, reintroduction, and capital gain from our biodiversity and ecosystems. 

As a hunter, think about it. Big game parks, all over the great plains. Coinciding with ranches, state, and national parks. Hunters benefit. Local economies benefit. Tourism benefits. It's a win win for everyone, when done correctly. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Can you cite a source? I've just never heard of humans successfully replacing natural predators, I could be wrong though.

Edit: And the reason to return these megafauna is to return (for example) the great plains to their natural state. Large animals eat large amounts of plants, which are hunted by large predators, which die off to feed large scavengers. All of which returns nutrients to the soil. VERY, VERY simplified. 

We also have fossil evidence to date a lot of those animals back as well. Pre-humans. As in 13,000 years ago. Not very long at all. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> I am giving a book as a gift to my boyfriend (us getting back together?) and need suggestions on a) a good place to look for rare-ish books online for a good deal b) a good philosophical piece that's spiritual, yet digestible to your average joe </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-08-23 01:48:51 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> First off, yes, I'm getting him a 'omg, we're back together' gift. weird. But let's move on. And bare with me, book suggestions are needed.

A)

1: He's a fan of The Jungle Book movie, which is a pretty sweet animation. I just thought it'd be cute to go a step further and get him a first edition of the original, or a later edition with some age to it that he'd like. Maybe I'm thinking in the wrong direction. Any who, where a bouts could I find such a book for a good deal? In that same arena...

2: Disco Bloodbath by James St. James. Made impossible to find by Party Monster. We are a gay couple, and he's seen the movie and all it's horrific glory, and thought it'd be a sick find. I don't even know where I'd begin to find such a thing, and how much it's selling for. Is it too risky? Is the Jungle Book idea better? You tell me...

B) Scrap both of those ideas. Something philosophical? He was a philosophy major for awhile, and enjoys reading on the subject quite a bit. Very spiritual. Almost nihilistic. But I know for a fact he doesn't like pompous, or over the top eccentric language. Down to earth. Readable. Hopefully positive. I'm more of a 'tangible sciences' type of guy, so I really have no idea on what would be good. Help?

Overall, which idea do you like best, which is doable, and maybe what suggestions you might have.

Oh yea all online! 

Thanks r/booksuggestions!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm a dog groomer, and sort of late to this one.

I've been grooming for around 2 years now, but when i started as an apprentice, my instructor wanted me to shave the hair out of a bulldog's pads (they have short hair, so this doesn't make sense, though i believe the dog stepped in something that gunked the hair together that the bath couldn't get out, I digress.) 

Well, I was doing my job, and as bulldogs normally do, he donkey kicked me. Except I had clippers in my hand. Well the clippers went flying. I fumbled them in the air for a few seconds while they were still running, and the clippers, just for a millisecond of a second, landed on the dog. They made a three inch line of no hair, on a dog that never needed to see clippers for a groom in its entire life (maybe a #50 or #60 blade for surgery prep, again, digressing.) Fortunately my instructor was cool about it, and explained it all to the owners, and took the blame herself. Could of been like a million times worse. But then again, I'm not sure the hair will grow back normally. Bulldogs are weird. </TEXT>

We broke up a few months ago, and got back together. My jealousy had a lot to do with it. I get pretty mad when he hangs out with his other gay friends. Especially older ones that are in open relationships. I've curbed it to some extent, because I know he loves me. I want him to have friends, and wants the same to me. I just can't help but say stupid shit and act like an envious, psychotic douchenozzle. Bleh. I'm *trying* to work on it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This made me sad to think about. Well... I got STD tested before I dated my first boyfriend at a christian testing center. We started dating, and then the results came back. It said I was HIV-1 positive. While I freaked out and got tested over and over again (even the state health department got involved), my boyfriend stayed by my side, well aware he might test positive as well. Every test came back negative, and I, understandably, lost my shit over the next 6 weeks. Finally, they were able to tell me I was negative. The whole thing of me losing my shit mentally, and this whole 'we both have HIV' thing threw a wrench in our relationship, so he broke up with me. Which I get. Completely. It was both of our first relationship and it was just totally fucked up by me. We've both moved on and done better and bigger things. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> The little koala (A children's short story with elements of conservation and biology) </TITLE>

	<TEXT> The little koala



Our story begins deep within a forest that was big, tall, and smelled clean all the time. The sky was always blue and the sun was so hot you could cook an egg on a rock. The leaves were crunchy, and the birds were real loud. They sounded just like in the movies. What does this sound like to you?


On one of these big, clean smelling trees, slept a little koala. She was small and grey. Her eyes closed shut and she snored, sometimes itching her little back with her big koala claws. A parrot looking bird called a cockatoo landed right next to her and woke her up with the birds loud squawk.


When the little koala awoke, she wasnt happy. She was grumpy from her nap. She likes to sleep all the time. The little koala was now hungry and grumpy, and wanted to drink some milk from her mother, so she called out to her mother. It sounded like coo-coo.


She looked to the left. She then looked to the right. Her mother was no where to be seen. All she could see was that loud cockatoo that woke her up. She began to cry, because now she was grumpy, hungry, and sad. Where did her mother go? Didnt she know it was time for the little koala to eat?


The cockatoo looked at the little koala with curiosity. This made the little koala even more grumpy. The cockatoo came closer, and closer, and closer. The little koala swatted the bird with her big claws, but the bird wouldnt go away. Off in the distance, a bunch of odd sounds finally scared the bird away. They were coming closer!


Bark, bark, bark, bark, the little koala had never heard the sounds before. They were new sounds, and they were scary sounds. They were getting louder, too! The little koala started climbing up her tree, as far up as she could climb with her little koala claws. The animals that made the 'bark bark bark sound were close.


She was so scared! She closed her eyes real tight, and imagined her mother was holding her close. Nothing could get her if her mother was there. Just like that, the barking stopped, and the scary animals ran away. She was still scared, but glad they were gone. She started climbing back down the tree, when all of the sudden she was stuck in a net!


The little koala fell from the tree inside this net, and she scratched and scratched so she could get free. She used all the strength she had in her little koala claws, but nothing worked. She soon gently fell to the ground, and was surrounded by a tall blonde woman that smelled like flowers. The little koala began to cry.


The woman quickly wrapped the little koala in a blanket and held her close. The little koala was less scared.
Im sorry, little koala. You must be so scared. Lets get you some food and a nice place to sleep, away from those dogs. Everything is going to be alright.
The little koala felt a little better from the sweet sound of her voice.


Just like the woman had said, the little koala was safe with her. She was no longer grumpy, and she was no longer hungry. The little koala wasnt mad, and she was no longer scared. She had a new home, with lots of other little koala friends, and she could still climb the clean smelling trees and sleep, just like where our story began.

	<TEXT> It gets better once you don't test positive for THC, which could be a few weeks, or for me, a few months (I'm not fat, I'm big boned.... lol I'm not fat). 

Your symptoms of withdrawal will take about that amount of time. [Marijuana Anonymous' website](https://www.marijuana-anonymous.org) has a great section on what to expect with withdrawal. Some things i experienced? Mood swings, outburst, being thirsty, decreased then later increased appetite and weight gain, insomnia, paranoia, lethargy, believe it or not, these are normal. Your body is getting rid of THC, you will be weird. It looks like bipolar, schizophrenia, clinical insomnia, which you may or may not have, but you need to properly detox before getting the best diagnosis. Thank god I waited, cause I'm (mostly) good now and don't need medication for much of anything. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's good man! I might even go a step farther though... It sounds cold as fuck, but friends that still smoke? I might just hangout with them less. Or if they do, let them know it can't be around you. For any reason. I mean I still have friends that smoke, just only a very select few. And they don't smoke around me. My boyfriend smokes as well. And I NEVER let him do it around me, he even keeps all his gear in a cabinet I don't go in to normally. What has happened, is that the people that smoke bud moved on. They didn't have a codependent in me, so they just found other people to blaze with. I'm better for it, they weren't real homies. Day.... 323 or something? I should probably know that. </TEXT>

Going on walks will become your best friend. Realize that you can only live day by day. Your goal is to not smoke JUST for today. You are not a fortune teller. You could pick up a joint tomorrow. But just for today, you won't. And that my dear friend, is amazing.

	<TEXT> He wasn't much to look at,

The ragged, mange'd tiger.

Let's just say the years took a toll.


The cat had a strip of forest,

Grandfathered in, gifted, with

The occasional sika fawn, food.


Moving forward wasn't an issue,

And survival was second nature

When cornered with a hunter's gun.


Though on each side of the land,

Were two other tigers' territories,

Neither aware of the other.


He knew both of them intimately,

One of lust, adventure, new beginnings,

The other of a boundless, philosophical depth.


To turn your head to the wind,

Was to smell the latter in memories,

Or the former in pure hormonal drive.


How can a beast be tamed to a decision?

How can a baffoon even think decisively?

How can a bundle of sticks catch a flame?


More importantly, and quite obviously, 

How did the fellow get to be so lucky

As to have to ask God on advice for love? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey guys!

Well to start out, i first smoked pot when I was around 16, to get closer to friends I may or may not have had crushes on. Well music sort of replaced that, so I didn't smoke really until college, and I met more attractive people whom I wanted attention from!

Soon, it wasn't about friends, it was about feeding my monster (I'm the monster). Reisin tokes from pipes that weren't mine, stealing from friends, digging through my car carpet to look for little nugs, hitting up people to hook up with ONLY because I wanted to smoke (I think that counts as a form of prostitution?); I was a slob. I had this chick that worked at a clinic tell me I was on the lower end of the pot smoking pyramid. I agreed not knowing how right she actually was.

So I went to rehabs. 3. When I was 19 (outdoor wilderness... sweet), 21 (hospital?), and 22 (mostly heroin junkies there... fuck). Nothing worked. I seemed to get out, be sober for awhile, then just kind of meet up with certain people and it'd be back to square one. Well most recently, I was sober, working a great job, then just kind of got desperate. Met a stoner, moved across the country with him, and surprisingly (not surprisingly) my life turned to shit quickly. So I quit. I quit pot, quit him, moved back, and got my life back on track.

I've pissed off a lot of people in my life. I make amends when I can. I find prayer helps. Working. Being proud of my work. Dating has been considerably less stressful and oddly enough, people find me more attractive? Weird. It's also weird to look at that number. 320. A lot has happened in those days. First 2 months I was still basically a train wreck while I detoxed. I got over it with a good diet. But it just zoomed by. Life has gone by, with or without pot. Now I'm just aware of it. The haze has been lifted and I can exist within the days passing by.

So. Thanks for existing. Thanks for not smoking pot. And thanks for reading a little bit about myself that i don't normally get to share. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ok few things

1) I would always go the professional route, 10 lbs australian shepherd should only be about 50 bucks.

2) If I was absolutely strapped for cash (and wasn't a groomer), I wouldn't use clippers on the dog, especially a double coated dog like yours. The hair grows back badly, ruins the top coat. I would skim the butt area, where the most hair grows, with the clippers. I've used a 10, but you can make mistakes easily. If you don't want to make a mistake, use thinning sheers to make the butt area behind the back legs look uniformly rounded. Then, I would make the outline of the dog even (the back of the front legs, the chest, the undercarriage) with thinning sheers. It's a great, natural look. For the clippers, I would clean the anal area (one inch each side to make sure poop doesn't get stuck), the bottom of the paws (scooping out the hair gently), and that's about it. #10 blade, I use a #40 on the feet, don't do that. I would not shave this dog, and i would beg a client not to either. This is a brushing dog. Lots and lots of brushing. Make sure the dog is 100% dry before doing any of this, and clean 100%.

Edit: Tired of hand scissoring? Skim with a #10, just do it at your own risk. You may make holes.

Let me know if you have any other questions. </TEXT>

Newspaper correspondent Chengjiang Feng / text 
Newspaper reporters TaoYu its / photo 
Spring, the Dongyang streets often inundated with strange taste. Dongyang people say that this is the boy egg taste, but also the taste of spring. 
Do not want to surprise people familiar with the matter: the boy with the boy in urine is boiled eggs, eggs, eggs in the spring of stalls selling all over the lad Dongyang streets. A fifty-one lad expensive than ordinary eggs boiled eggs, can often sell out of stock. 
Do not underestimate this one boy eggs, it was named Dongyang intangible cultural heritage. 
Classroom door 
The boys in front of a plastic barrel "hush hush" 
Dongyang city in an elementary school, recess, a bunch of little boys crowded in the hallway outside the classroom noisy. Do not think that what they are playing new stuff, they are urinating. 
In Dongyang, this old custom has been formed: the street vendors who sell eggs boy or boy eggs to cook their own people, will be carrying a plastic bucket to a school boy to collect the urine. 
Students who long ago got used to this, one to three grade boys to urinate, he will align the plastic bucket outside the classroom. School teacher, also acquiesced in such behavior, they will always remind the kids not to pee in a plastic bucket during cold sick. The children came obedient. 
Boiled eggs and cook boiled eggs almost boy 
The most critical time heat 
Oddly enough, although this season has filled the stalls sell eggs boy, but every family believes their own unique taste. 
Li aunt runs a stall selling eggs boy. Her husband went to a nearby elementary school is responsible for daily pick boy urine. She is responsible for cooking and trafficking. 
In front of her stall, a briquette stove is hard to give steel cookware is heated. Pot head "water" looks yellow, which also had a little foam afloat. Li aunt to wash eggs one by one into steel finishing Guo Lifang. 
"After this road to boil, put all our eggs out, knock crack the shell, and put into cooking. Over time, then up and down to change the location of the eggs, add fresh boy urine. This repeated, with different fire , cook the whole day and night. "When it comes to the process of boiled eggs, and Li said the aunt, principle and almost cooked boiled eggs, and time to master the furnace is the most critical. 
Some people say eating addiction "really sweet", some people feel that "stinks" 
With urinary boiled eggs, what would taste? 
Yesterday, 12:00 many people coming and going on the road, Dongyang urban revitalization, visit the lad egg eaters natural lot. "Good food, I eat 10 it one day." Liu Dongyang several years ago with her husband came to life, "had never eaten later after eating a hooked." 
If one sentence Dongyang preference for boy eggs, friends, "surname eggs" on the microblogging put it very well - the lad egg taste is the taste of spring. 
But not all people are good this one Dongyang. 30 years, a native of Lee boy did not eat eggs, "that I can not stand the taste, I thought of nausea, stinks." 
Boy eggs fill it? TCM each saying: be careful to eat, no objection 
Dongyang in many people's eyes, with a boy in urine cooked eggs, spring tonic of choice. Boy selling eggs will always tell you, boy eat eggs, spring would not be sleepy, summer does not heat stroke. 
But to say this thing is going to fill a number, maybe the doctors would be more objective point. 
"Boy has a long history of eggs in Dongyang, previously poor living conditions, to do farm work, to make himself something only the eggs, while urine sediment over time, will form crystals, which is equivalent to a crystalline called 'white people' of traditional Chinese medicine, can nourishing yin, bleeding governance silt. "Dongyang City Hospital medical director Wu Yunhua introduced this boy eggs. But she also stressed that not everyone is suitable for the boy to eat eggs, depending on the individual's constitution. 
Jinhua Central Hospital Nephrology Master Ren Huangjian think, urine is the body's waste discharge, substantially free of substances beneficial to the human body. Therefore, he does not advocate everyone to eat the boy eggs. 
TCM  Jinhua City Hospital director said that, in ancient times, the boys often used as medicine introduction of urine, but modern health perspective, children boiled eggs in urine is always less hygienic. "But boy eating eggs has become Dongyang local customs, I do not advocate nor oppose it." 
Reporters also learned that the boy has been named Dongyang egg Intangible Cultural Heritage in 2008. In this regard, it is  Intangible Cultural Heritage Protection Center for  said that he collected information lad eggs and handed application. Finally, Dongyang folk art leadership team nine members unanimously adopted, after two weeks of publicity, Dongyang city government official under the document. 
Future, but also to declare non-heritage boy eggs or Jinhua, Zhejiang, it? Gong Mingwei said being no such intention.

	<TEXT> Take a bowl, put in some flour. Put a one or two pinches of baking soda and salt, any spices you want like pepper or cumin, whatever. Mix it dry, then slowly add water. Slowly mixing it, until it is doughy, not running. You want to be able to knead it in your hands (having flour on your hands help not get them disgusting). Do it for like... 5-10 minutes? Then flatten it in to small patties. Put the patty away from the flame, but close enough that it gets cooked, and here's the kicker, right on the ashes. What?! But then I'm eating ash! No, you pat it away after the bread cooks, plus, a little ash never hurt anyone. It's awesome, amazing, and great to eat with beans, hummus, meat, whatever. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's not confusion if they've come to terms with their identity. Heteronormative culture tells you because of your genitals at birth, you fit in this corner or that corner. That's what has people confused at a young age. Their brains tell them what society says is not true. That constant chastising of a person's personal gender identity, such as saying a woman is not a woman, because she happened to be born with a penis, is transphobia. With or without whatever genitals said person has, it's not your business, and it's not a determinate factor of that person's gender identity or sexuality. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Look up the game 'Mafia'. 'Candybar' is another really good game.

If you bring flour, some baking soda, some salt, you can make ash bread in the camp fire.

Cook food you like. Go shopping and freeze stuff if you must. No one likes to eat shitty food.

Layers are your best friend.

Please, please, please, please, follow a No-Trace with everyone. Come as you went. Pick up all trash. Don't disrupt the ecosystem (tearing apart trees and bushes for fire material, it takes a LONG time for them to grow back). Don't feed animals, ever. </TEXT>
