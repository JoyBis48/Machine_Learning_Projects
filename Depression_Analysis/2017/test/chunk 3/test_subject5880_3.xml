[Here are pictures of what he is selling.](http://imgur.com/a/wRDO1)

[Here is a picture of an authentic Vision Spinner II and Mini Protank 3 I purchased.](http://i.imgur.com/7fIhRbq.jpg)

[Here is the invoice for the purchase.](http://i.imgur.com/UI9sxSN.png) $50.

Maybe OP can defend why these are 50% off and not authentic looking. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you for your reply. My main concern here - what I was angry about, was that I thought LazyPancake was a moderator, and when I saw his/her comment:

You're a horrible person. You don't deserve a significant other if you can just so callously brush aside a cheating incident.

When someone makes you their world, when they love you whole-heartedly, and they put all their trust in you, it doesn't matter if you cheated once, or 100 times, you're still an awful human being. You should absolutely tell them. It's called RESPECT. If you don't have enough respect for them as a person to not fuck other people, then you need to man/woman the fuck up and tell him/her.

They always find out.

I was enraged because I couldn't believe a moderator would say shit like that in their own subreddit. 

That part of my comment on here became completely void, and the fact that people were in here just totally sounding off their mouths for OP to "grow a pair" and just totally slamming him, wouldn't have been angering enough by itself to make me want to call out the moderators. I understand that shitty people are everywhere, and yeah, maybe it was like that before I joined. Maybe it was just sort of a bias I had being a new user that I was just happy to be here and didn't really see all of the hate around here, but still I feel like it's gotten worse for sure.

Back to what you were talking about, though, I'm still going to be "that guy", the ass. When it comes to people with just unhelpful harassing hate speech on here (all of /u/j-chance's initial comments), I feel like other subreddits would at the very least delete some of the real nasty things he said. You were concerned about censoring or banning becoming an abuse of power, but with something like what's coming out of this kids keyboard, I really don't think it'd be that at all. It'd really kind of be a good use of the power you have, in my mind. I'm not a moderator, I'm not going to tell you anymore about how to do your job. I appreciate your reply and I don't mean to make you miffed. The purpose of my post was to make whoever promoted LazyPancake miffed out, but turns out she moderators ECR_Plus and not this subreddit. Have a good day, man.

	<TEXT> YES! The fogger v4 is excellent, and I came here to recommend it. I got mine in early June of 2014, and it was the only atomizer I used from then until just yesterday I bought another. While it is a rebuildable tank atomizer, when my tank runs dry, I can drip through the drip tip to make it until my next refill, or to try out new Eliquids.

I give the product an 8/10. The flavor is incredible, the vapor production is excellent, and the reliability is spot on - worked for me for over a half year. 

However, it takes a very long time to find the right wicking strategy - it is very hard to build. This alone is why it lost 2 points. It will take you lots of time to figure out how to stop the leaking. 

I myself am a bigger fan of the second to last produced fogger v4 (they put out like 5 versions of the v4, the last produced is the fogger v4.1) with the bigger deck. The bigger deck makes it much easier to wick and build, as the closeness of the deck to the glass of the tank slows down the Eliquid as its feeding from the tank into the coils.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The MVP is a good starter, but take note that although it comes with a tank, the iClear30, the tank isn't really all that great and I wouldn't rely on it. 

Also, really make sure that with the MVP that you keep the [510 connection dry] ( http://imgur.com/fb3lLK7), as Eliquid will get that rubber insulator wet and ruin it. My MVP 510 has failed and doesn't work, cause it's just not all that great. 

Another downside about the MVP is that if you venture into a rebuildable atomizer, the MVP doesn't throw enough amps to power dual coils. 

Other than that, the mvp is a great device. It's perfect for a beginner, and it'll power clearomizers very well. The battery life is absolutely excellent, and the fact that it has an ohms reader built into it is very very useful, even if you outgrow vaping on the device.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sorry to see that you're getting a lot of negative feedback here. I think you asked a good question. Companies offer discreet shipping for reasons like this. I wish maybe a moderator would handle some of the senseless vulgar fighting - none of that belongs in this subreddit, nor was it here when I joined. If you don't like a post, you have the option of down voting it and moving on. 

Edit: instead of a moderator trying to help you out, one of them is in here dissing you for wanting to pick up vaping. 

/u/LazyPancake

/u/Lynda73,  how did this subreddit come to this? This is supposed to be a welcoming and helpful community for both those who want to quit smoking and those who want to pick up vaping, regardless of their reasoning. 

Edit^2: I guess LazyPancake isn't a mod, although he posts the daily questions threads. That changes the whole situation greatly.

Edit^3: sorry, LazyPancake, that I've made you mad. Thanks for going through my profile and down voting 45 of my posts.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In GTA IV, I once tried to buy a hot dog from the seller near the pier for the annihilator choppers. 

The option to buy a hot dog did not come up, so naturally I point my gun at him to intimidate him. Then, something I've never seen before happened. 

The hotdog seller just simply fell down, as if I had knocked him over by just pointing a gun at him. As he was slowly falling into his hotdog stand, he hit the propane tank located on his side of the stand, exploding the hotdog stand and killing us both. 

In GTA IV, I once tried to buy a hot dog from a jihadist. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> She said in a different thread that the coil is reading "NON" from the MVP, but the original reads fine. That usually means that the 510 isn't contacting the atomizer, or the coil isn't contacting the atomizer, not that there's a dead short in the coil, so I'm out of ideas. I don't use aspire products :(, could she have the wrong coil? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I take back everything I said - old reply deleted. Definitely drunk, didn't realize that you have the new MVP 20w and not the iStick 20w. If the MVP reads NON, there is definitely something not making contact. 

Can you double check right now that if you screw in the old coil, that it does not read NON? 

If it doesn't read NON, confirm that the two coils you are using are the same size and length. If they are, you have a dud coil and need to replace it with a different one.

If it does read NON, this is a known problem with the old MVPs that could've carried over into your new MVP. If all else fails, try gently prying up the center pin of the 510 connection on the MVP, [this thing here, ] ( http://imgur.com/fb3lLK7) with a paperclip. You just need to pull that pin up a little bit to contact your atomizer, then your coil should fire again.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> "NON" means that it doesn't detect any metal device, not even a shorted coil. That usually happens when your atomizer does not contact the battery/device (your iStick). Make sure it's screwed on tight enough, that the metal pin in the center of the bottom of the atomizer sticks out a little bit. If it's screwed down all the way, try unscrewing it a tiny bit/wiggling it back and forth until you see a resistance. Try turning your iStick off and back on again. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you dive into the court transcript the article links to, even though the article states that he was arrested for disorderly conduct for giving the cop the finger, it turns out that the giving of the finger had almost nothing to do with the arrest. It seems like the finger giving guy swore the cop up and down, and then came at him (saying he wanted to talk "Man to Man" with the officer) in a way that one side says is threatening and one side says was not, and was then arrested for disorderly conduct

Also interesting, here are the cop's reasons for pulling over the car whose passenger flipped them off:


(1) Johns gesture appeared to me he was trying to get my attention for some reason, (2) I thought that maybe there could be a problem in
the car. I just wanted to assure the safety of the passengers, and
(3) I was concerned for the female driver, if there was a domestic
dispute. (uscourts.gov pgs 4 5)

This was in fact really ridiculed in the court report. </TEXT>

0.7x0.1 = 29 gauge

0.8x0.1 = 28 gauge

0.9x0.1 = 27 gauge

What you want to do to find what is right for you is head over to [Steam Engine](http://www.steam-engine.org/coil.asp), under Material and Profile, select Kanthal A1 Ribbon, under Setup, select how many coils you usually rock, select your usual goal resistance, and your usual coil diameter. Then, play around with the thickness of the ribbon wire until you get an amount of wraps you like. 

On my mechanical mod, I generally like about 6 wraps of 26 gauge round kanthal around a 5/64" or 1/10" diameter, amounting to 0.4 ohms, so I picked 0.8mm by 0.1mm flat ribbon wire, and I should have mine in a few days here.

Lemme know if you have any other questions. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't know why you'd have to take big hits - I run my rebuildable Fogger v4 at high temperatures and I can even get great taste in the tiniest hit - I haven't had flavor only come with big hits. 

~~50 Watts might be harsh, but it might also be awesome!~~ I see what you mean about the harshness of 50w. What causes harshness in an e-liquid is the levels of propylene glycol as well as the nicotine concentration of the e-liquid. With this sort of higher powered tank, you can reduce the nicotine concentration (because you're vaporizing more liquid faster), and run higher vg liquids to smooth out the vapor.

 I run about 30 from a mechanical mod and see room for more wattage. The thing about this box mod is that its output is fully customizable from 2v-10v, and 5w-50w. I recommend this over the regular eLeaf iStick, because it won't fire the Atlantis. The Atlantis' coils measure out to 0.5 ohms and the original iStick, while awesome, fires only down to 1 ohm. There is a 30w eLeaf iStick, which fires down to 0.4 ohms. 

[Here's the spec sheet for the 50watt](http://www.eleafworld.com/product/detail.php/istick-50w.html)

	<TEXT> As you go lower in resistance the coil will reach higher heats (watts). This will throw better clouds, as well as warmer and tastier vapor, but it needs to be paired with fast wicking speed in order to prevent dry hits, because you're vaporizing more liquid faster. 

Gradually drop your resistance. If you start getting dry hits galore, increase the resistance of your coils. You can also rebuild them yourself to whatever resistance you desire, if you're inclined to do so. It's easy, but you won't be able to make them dual coils - it really takes a machine to fit two coils that close in that tight of space with no shorts. I used to rebuild mine single coil all the time with cotton for increased wicking speed and noticed much better results. 

If you're purchasing coils, I'd choose 1.5 over 0.8. I don't think Kanger's wicking speed will keep up.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I know you said you don't like big clouds and appreciate simplicity, but the newest thing out right now is the aspire Atlantis and kanger subtank. These two tanks (I don't know much about the kanger version) are made to run at warmer temperatures (which while offering bigger clouds will also offer stronger flavor) ,  similar to those of a rebuildable atomizer, while having easy replaceable coils, just like your protank. 

The aspire Atlantis won't fire on your MVP (the coils measure out to 0.5ohms, mvps fire  0.7), but it will fire on something like the new eleaf istick 50w coming out on January 26th ($50), or any mechanical mod.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi, friend. You write beautifully.

I've lost two friends of mine to suicide, just under a year apart. One I was close to, but the more recent passing was of a friend who my relationship with is very similar to that of the friend you lost. He had moved away, we became distant, and I had no clue he was feeling the way he was until that one day when he just snapped.

A moment later, I was angry.
Not at him, but at myself for not being there for him. For not being close to him as I should have. I knew a lot about him, but I never took the time to actually be with him.

It seems like some self-blame is coming up here. You wish you had been there for him. The thing to remember is that you couldn't really have predicted that he would have passed away, no one could have - even while knowing quite a bit about his harsh past. Another thing is that maybe it isn't your fault that the two of you became a bit distant - it takes two to have a friendship, maybe there were obstacles coming up in your life that you couldn't control, which prevented you from being close to him, or maybe it was him that grew distant to you. As I'm sure you know, becoming distant from society is one of the first moves those who are deeply depressed or suicidal tend to make - whether it's purposely or inadvertently. He could have isolated himself.

Another huge thing I've learned through some therapy has to do with self-blame. I didn't see this come up in your writing, but I wanted to mention it just in case. In the passing of my first friend who I was close to, I felt largely to blame, because we had promised each other that if either of us were to commit suicide, that we'd go to the other person for help first, and while he kept up his side of the deal, he went to me for help, I had pushed him away - I was fighting with my girlfriend at the exact same time, he really didn't make it clear that he was thinking about suicide, just that he was deeply depressed, and I told myself that I'd meet up with him in the morning to make up for the half-assed advice I was giving him then. I of course felt that I was to blame - that I had let him down, but the important thing to remember is that you were not the cause of his passing - he made a decision - one that no one else could make for him. In the end, it was his choice, and as horrible as it is, nothing can change that. 

 I wanted to forget him, I wanted to push him out of my mind and push him away. But I couldnt. Hes there.

You will come to terms with this more easily far in the future. While right now it is going to hurt every day, the pain does diminish gradually over time. It DOES get better.  While he will always have a place in your heart (and that's not a bad thing, my first friend passed in 2011 and I now smile whenever I think of him - I was lucky to have known him while I did), he doesn't necessarily have to always have a place in your mind. While he is there constantly right now, as time goes on he will be there only as long as you want him to be.  That's okay - remember that even while he left, that he wouldn't want to be a cause of pain for the people he knew. He would want you to smile when you think about him - and I think you really highlighted that well in the last paragraph. 

I wasnt even close to him but he had affected me with so much distress.

This is completely normal. Don't ever feel that you don't have permission to be sad just because you had grown distant near the end. I went to a highschool with a pretty high suicide rate, and I noticed that a death manages to bring down a whole community, whether they were close to that person, once knew that person, sometimes saw that person, or even if they didn't know them at all - they will be saddened by the loss of that person. What you're feeling sucks hard, but it is natural. Also, I feel from some of the memories you shared that you were close to him in heart.

There's also quite a bit of talk of suicide throughout here - that you've attempted, wish to be gone like him, and feel very sad right now. I know everything really sucks right now, and I feel for you - that's why I'm writing. I've been in similar shoes. I feel that for almost all of my life I've been considering and sometimes attempting suicide, and a year and a few months ago, I was hospitalized as well. I just want to share with you that for such a long period of my life, I felt like there was no way out but suicide - that I was destined to go that way, but now, I absolutely love my life. Not only do I not feel suicidal, but my overall feelings/signs of depression have decreased, and my feelings of anxiety have decreased tremendously - even though less than a half a year ago I was diagnosed major depressive with some sort of severe anxiety disorder. I never thought it would be possible for me to feel this way - to look back on all the times I had attempted to take my life and be glad that I had not taken it - but it IS possible, and it IS something that can be in your future, so please don't skip out on the time that you will too feel this way. I'm off my meds, single and independent, in a stable household with a sort of foster family, I've amended my previously non-existent relationship with my parents, in college, with a job, and feeling great - and you can be too. Please hang in there through this time. It's a really shitty tunnel, but there is beautiful light at the end of it - and you don't have to reach it by taking your life.

I really hope I could help a bit. If you want to talk further about this, vent a little bit, ask questions or pick my brain, just please comment on here - I'm here for ya. Best of luck. </TEXT>
