----------------------------


So, the SpaceX hype turned out to be just that. An altogether more prosaic investment was announced to fund core operations.


SpaceX, currently embroiled in a court case with its benefactor the US government which elected to give SpaceX no part of a recent $11bn launch order (http://spacenews.com/42882filing-suggests-jurisdictional-challenge-in-spacex-lawsuit-against-us ) and on the heels of a recently crashed launch, needed cash. This investment is about funding its core operations, not about initiating some fantasy global satellite constellation about which no mention is made.


Google (who made no comment) are named alongside Fidelity as investors, but no amount is given. So, it could be the Google Charitable Foundation, and it could be $1 for all we know. Fidelity invests for a living.


Also, in typically cryptic fashion, no terms are mentioned. Ordinary shares, convertible loans, preference shares, exploding warrants, covenants and targets ?


The uninformative Spacex website merely has the text below, making it clear that proceeds are to fund continued innovation in the areas of space transport, reusability, and satellite manufacturing i.e. the core business was running out of money, and no mention of fleets of satellites.


Space Exploration Technologies (SpaceX) has raised a billion dollars in a financing round with two new investors, Google and Fidelity. They join existing investors Founders Fund, Draper Fisher Jurvetson, Valor Equity Partners and Capricorn. Google and Fidelity will collectively own just under 10% of the company.


SpaceX designs, manufactures, and launches the worlds most advanced rockets and spacecraft. This funding will be used to support continued innovation in the areas of space transport, reusability, and satellite manufacturing.


Incredibly, newspspers of record like The Times reported last night the rumours, not the facts SpaceX is a private company and thus is subject to no stock market rules about truthful or complete press releases. Google made no announcement, suggesting nothing material has happened

	<TEXT> Costco again proves that you can treat employees well and pay them a fair wage while remaining competitive.  

Look into the history of costco management. They have very consistently and firmly stood by their employees.
A few years ago they were ridiculed by their investors for basically treating their employees too well (too much pay, too many benefits, etc). The CEO basically told the investors that they were welcomed to sell off their stock if they have a problem with it, but that the company has consistently been a good investment because of the decisions they make to stand by their employees and that he has no intention of changing that.

I have a lot of admiration for costco as a company.  All hail Costco ~ company of common sense and eminent reign. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> All the talk of mass surveillance is very dangerous if it doesn't come with some hope of a solution because it grants more perceptual power to a system that already has a radical, extreme and destabalising amount of it. All that is necessary to control others is the projected perception of power. That's why we have worked hard to break that perception, for example in the race to spirit Edward Snowden to asylum vs. Washington DC's race to arrest him, we won, demonstrating that with a few good ideas and some determination it is possible to beat this power cluster in a well defined head on contest.Solutions are going to come form the demand that organisations, governments and individuals have for protection. Don't be dispirited; a lot of people are now working rapidly on tools and standards to counter the mass surveillance attack. There's a great flowering in that field. </TEXT>
