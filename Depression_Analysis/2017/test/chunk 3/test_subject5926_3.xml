	<TEXT> * How the fuck do i get rid of that emptiness inside when i finish a new anime?  
  
Thats the hardest part, best way is probably filling hole with another series   
also: My first anime was Soul Eater, after i finished it i felt big hole, but then i got the manga and read it and i felt way better, yeah and watching AMV of series you just finished will also help (at least for me it does)  
  
* Is there a way to control the "just one more episode and i'll go to bed"?  
  
Cant answer you on that one, its 5am here and Im sitting here watching anime.  
  
* I've spent way to much time on anime lately, so now that i'm into anime, is there a way out?  
  
Why would you want to get out ? Its like trying to jump out of luxury train, why would you do it ?
