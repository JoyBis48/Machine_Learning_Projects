	<TEXT> Anyone want to guess where Thor and Hulk will be during this? I'm guessing Thor will be in Asgard dealing with Loki and trying to find out what happened to Odin and Hulk will possibly be off world? on his own intergalactic adventure if the rumors are to be believed.

	<TEXT> I think a really cool franchise could be made out of Inception. It could be like the matrix mixed with a bit of bond/mission impossible action along with some spy thriller elements.And if they couldn't get DiCaprio to return then it could focus on the other members of the team and have the second and third film follow them around on other extraction jobs with an over arcing plot involving some sort of government conspiracy and cyber criminals and terrorists where they extract or plant ideas to prevent attacks and catch criminals etc. Any other ideas? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Does anyone have any idea why marvel seem to have put it on the back burner for now? Everyone seemed damn sure we would get one in phase 3 but we didn't and now it looks like we might not even get one in phase 4. It looks like the Hulk will continue to be a supporting character in the avengers films which is kind of sad that marvel seem to be wasting Marks talent by using him once every 2-3 years for avengers films. Look I get that the Hulk isn't exactly an easy character to make a movie about due to him being a sort of anti hero if you will and it can be difficult to balance between Banner and Hulk but come on marvel give Hulk some love in phase 4 please! </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2015-01-17 04:00:58 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So Im a bit confused about the time line in the upcoming x-men apocalypse film. Since everything has been reset in DOFP. Does apocalypse take place in a new universe post time line reset or is it before the reset? Im guessing its before since the original cast wont be returning because all of the x-men will be too young for the original actors . But its been confirmed for a while now that Hugh Jackman will return as Wolverine. So how does that work ? or will it be like DOFP and some of it will be in the past and future at the same time? </TEXT>

This trailer was beautifully put together, its a shame the movie didn't quite live up to the hype that came from it. Still enjoyed the final product tho. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PSNL1qE6VY

Spiderman 3

This trailer got me so damn excited for venom and it still does. Just wish they could of done better by the character. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bzqHbTD64w

Inception

As great as inception was I still think its trailers were better than the movie itself especially this one the action, music and sound design in the trailer was miles above anything that was actually featured in the movie itself.  Still a great film tho again another one that was way over hyped thanks to a great trailer.

	<TEXT> ok here are some of mine.  

Star Wars will flop and all of Disney's future plans for the franchise are scrapped it becomes the biggest flop of all time. 

Furious 7 will be another smash hit in the fast and furious franchise spawning 3 more sequels. set for release in 2017,2019,2021 respectively. 

Avengers age of ultron will top  avatars 2 billion dollars at the Box office. the huge success will cause marvel to change some of its phase 3 plans and bring avengers infinity war part 1 forward to 2017 and part 2 in 2018. The other films will have their dates shifted slightly but phase 3 will remain intact. 

Ant-Man will be a surprise hit. Marvel will announce a sequel but will not give a release date. Many will suspect it wont be released until phase 4. 

In February Marvel and Sony announce that Spiderman will return to marvel with a new trilogy of films, the first film will be announced for 2017 starring Andrew Garfield, Garfield will also feature in avengers infinity parts 1 and 2 with a cameo in Captain America: Civil War. As part of the deal sony will get a portion of the box office earnings.  

The Avatar sequels finally begin principal photography in Wellington, New Zealand. 

After the huge success of the final hobbit film. At comic con 2015 Warner bros announces a middle earth cinematic universe.Peter Jackson will be the creative visionary behind the universe he will be the WB version of Kevin Feige, the first film will be a trilogy of films based on the origin of the Witch King of Angmar the first film would release in 2017. 

At comic con 2015 warner bros announces that batman v superman is split into 2 films with part 1 releasing in October and part 2 in march. 

Fantastic Four is another surprise hit. making around $450 million at the box office. Fox is slightly disappointed but they still go a head with the sequel and believe they can make this new iteration of Fantastic Four into a money making franchise.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> After seeing Whiplash I think he could pull it off. At times his character felt very isolated and was dealing with his own personal issues just like peter parker does and he played that very well. Not sure how well he would pull off spiderman tho. I've only seen him in whiplash so maybe someone else can chime in with their thoughts.  </TEXT>
