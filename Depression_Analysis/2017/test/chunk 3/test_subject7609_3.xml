p2p4 metatransfer

p3p3 gloomfiend

p5p1 i like spiritleash a lot but it isnt that good in your deck. you have a death seeker/nightgaunt but unless you play all three, i think id just rather take a 3rd infiltrator. if you want to go for it though it seems fine, it won't kill your deck either way

p5p2 i think ossuary spirit is pretty much filler, rather take digitize for a trick or a 2nd wurm

p6p1 maybe death seeker since you have the leash, or sonic pulse.

	<TEXT> This book was really a slog for me. Interesting premise, but horrible, wooden characters. Peter's wife is a walking stereotype. How many times throughout the book does she ask Peter if "this is really happening?" It's pretty clear Shute cannot write women. Commander Towers is unflinchingly rigid and by the book. I had a very hard time believing people would act like this at the end of the world.

The book just follows around these boring lifeless characters who are waiting to die, and don't do anything of note....I don't understand the praise heaped on this book </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The game has certainly improved in a lot of ways. They have implemented card crafting, which somewhat alleviates the P2W problem. The game is still not as friendly to F2P as Hearthstone, but it has improved. The introduction of drafts is also a great leveler where you can just focus on that rather than constructed.

They've also implemented drafts and constructed tourneys, which addresses the "not rewarding" problem which certainly existed before - there are actually fun things to do in the game now besides logging in and getting your 3 daily wins.

The game is about as luck heavy as any other CCG is. If this turns you off CCGs probably aren't for you in the first place. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Pretty much the only 3 tips you need to know to be able to draft, barring card evaluation.

I will usually let myself level 1 spell during level 1 max. I'm ok with leveling insane ones early (still try for 1 max though) like epidemic, twin growth, or spiritleash. If i can get nice value from it, I might play a spell at Lvl 1 that I can play for free the rest of the game like a contagion surge or primal strike. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Can't go wrong with anything by Flannery O'connor or Cormac McCarthy. I recommend Donald Ray Pollock all of the time, The Devil All the Time and Knockemstiff are both great. These books lean more to the southern gothic genre.

2666 is a great book.

There's a lot of horror on the list that is good as well - Lovecraft, Ligotti, Barron, Bierce, etc - good as well but not really like True Detective aside from the King in Yellow/Carcosa connection. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Just picked up this game yesterday, quick question on trading - Started a game and built some light ships to protect trade interests. Once I became involved in a war, all of my light ships got demolished. Some of it was definitely due to me not paying attention, but what is the general method to protect your trade ships when in war? </TEXT>

Great book though, looking forward to the next two. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The idea that some classics should be retired or are talked about too much doesnt sit right with me. I would never advise someone not to read a classic  Im not in the business of advising people not to read books. A lot of books are dated, but their time may come again. Classics are classics for a reason even if not all of those reasons, or the books themselves, are truly good. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> As of recently, I'd say more than 50% of my opponents mysteriously go inactive once it becomes clear they've lost, almost always returning once their timer hits around 2-3 minutes left in hopes that I've left to scum out a win.

Some modes it matters a little more than others (play vs. draft), but it makes the game unplayable in bite sized doses unless you're willing to lose or babysit your opponent for up to 15 minutes while doing nothing.

I understand implementing a turn timer or inactivity timer won't universally be an improvement for all, but something should be implemented by SB to combat this, it's a real enjoyment killer. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  And that's great, don't get me wrong. But there's a HUGE difference between when new gameplay mechanics are generated, and when they occupy a significant portion of the mainstream gaming consciousness. And indie games almost NEVER do that.

What a bunch of fluff. Why should game of the year be entwined with popularity? Of course indie games never "occupy a significant portion of the mainstream gaming consciousness", they can't compete with the corporate giants in terms of media exposure.
