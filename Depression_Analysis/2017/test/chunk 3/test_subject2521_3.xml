	<TEXT> I know all to well what you are talking about and find it quite unfortunate that Brownback (and the Koch brothers) have chosen this route. 

After serving an AmeriCorps term and working at Harvesters - Community Food Network, I have had first hand experience working with families in need. With all the govt. shutdown nonsense affecting recipients of WIC, this will only create more problems for these families and the life and well-being of (KS) citizens.

	<TEXT> Surprised no one has mentioned contraceptives. Isn't that one of the basic reasons Republicans wouldn't accept the Affordable Care Act (or at least it was highly publicized as a reason)? Seems ridiculous but then again, they also think it's necessary to accept rape.

Ok so that went from funny to sad, I do apologize. But only to non-Republicans. Otherwise you guys suck, and by suck, I mean your own balls.

	<TEXT> Wow, based on the original post, I wasn't expecting such harsh criticism. 

It is great to see a 'sneaky frat guy' actually showed respect for a drunken female. This DOES NOT mean all frat guys behave the same way. I've had my fair share of run ins with college douchebags, so I know.

As so, I have respect for this individual - - not all frat guys.

Oh and my brother is an alumni of a fraternity, so I have respect for those I know are actual gentleman.

Edit: Corrected a typo. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Here are two sites you might want to check out:

1.  Migraine Associated Vertigo (MAV) 
(http://vestibular.org/migraine-associated-vertigo-mav).

2. Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV) (http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/neurology_neurosurgery/specialty_areas/vestibular/conditions/benign_paroxysmal_positional_vertigo.html)


From March 2008-July 2013 I was misdiagnosed as having Menieres. After receiving little assistance from my ENT, I decided to try and manage my dizziness on my own. This was quite a challenge given the fact I still didnt understand why I was dizzy.

Within the past year I decided I wanted to get rid of, or at least try to treat, this problem. After doing a lot of research for specialists in my area, I came across an Audiologist not far from here. After the first round of testing, my previous diagnosis turned out to be wrong. Through these tests alone, it was determined that I had Migraine Associated Vertigo (MAV). Coincidentally I suffered from chronic migraines (diagnosed as depression) throughout high school (Sophomore - Senior year) and had a few years of 'relaxation' (3 years) until the vertigo spells started. The culprit? ***STRESS*** 

After coming to this conclusion, I still had to take into consideration that once I started having dizzy spells, I too lost the ability (equilibrium wise) to play sports, run, dance, etc. My life went from being a fun, energetic college student, to a recluse. I could no longer stand this and spoke to my Audiologist about this very problem. He introduced me to the Vestibular Therapist in the office and after only a months work, Im no longer dizzy and my ears stopped ringing (experienced Tinnitus 24 a day/ 7 days a week for the past 5+ years). If my ears start to ring, its usually a sign that my bodys telling me to stop, and relax.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you happen to have another cat, this breed tends to be territorial. Found this out after watching a few episodes of 'My Cat from Hell', and my mom just assumed it couldn't be fixed. Unforunately, it would have been an easy thing to do- had I only known at the time. She made me get rid of Bella after having her for only 2 years.

But..on to the good stuff:

Such a great breed, especially if you're in the mood for a playful, energetic and lovable kitty! Congrats!! :-D

	<TEXT> Oh eyebrows...once upon a time I had great eyebrows. Nice thickness and shape, but I was in high school and getting your eyebrows waxed was cool. So I went in and she took off too much - and well---- they never grew back (on both sides). On the left side (in the before picture) all visible brow was medically inserted years ago, to ensure I still somewhat had an eyebrow. It worked, for the most part, but transplanting hair (from say your head) to your face, it doesn't grow like facial hair....at all. Drawing them on hasn't been a great experience b/c I use to draw on a brown line and thought that would suffice. No wonder I received a lot of stares. Now I have a better idea of how they should look, just do not know how to go about drawing them! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> OMG thank you for mentioning the winged eyeliner! I never could figure out how people did that! 

I'll be sure to look more into that, as well as the lipsticks! :-) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I tried stenciles, but couldnt get the brows to match - height, shape, etc. Due in part to the scaring. I just trace the area out with an eyebrow pencil and fill it in with brown eyeshadows. Just using what I've had to get by!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Due to my skin tone, I can't find a color that really fits. Anything too dark or too light makes it the only thing you see, or directs attention to my eyes. It's quite a challenge...


I know, I know..then try something in-between. I have, and it's still overpowering :-/ </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've watched Youtube videos, and the like, for eyebrow tutorials, but it's easier said than done. Scaring makes drawing them on quite a challenge! I'll have a correct arch and shape (for my right eyebrow) but can't figure out how to replicate that for the left side. Have any tips?


Scaring certainly makes me self-conscious and I have even looked in to Dermabrasion, but it won't work the same for me as for others. Due to thinner skin (i.e. skin graft) plus missing bone tissue, muscle, etc, hiding such scars is quite a challenge.

Thank you for your kind words of advice! :-)

	<TEXT> When dealing with blush, I either can't see it or it's too overpowering. Can't seem to find a brand that compliments my skin tone. 

Eyeshadow is quite a bit different. As you can see, I have scaring above my left eye. More so, my entire eyelid consists of a skin graft. This makes applying eye makeup to be quite a challenge. Especially when I want to do something colorful and creative. Sorry, I should have made that problem more clear from the start. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Cellphone pics are quite a challenge when smiling! Spent close to 20min trying to take the before and after pics. Since there's a lot of scaring, by not smiling, you're able to see what I'm working with a little better. 

Lip color - ugh, that's a whole new challenge. I like light colors (i.e light pink, light bronze, just a shimmer, etc.) By not working much with lipsticks, etc. I haven't found a color that matches well. Or I find that it's too overpowering. 


Thanks for your tip! :-) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've tried darks and lights (hair color) but never seem to know what to do with my overall makeup. Even tried dirty-blonde-streaks back in high school, and to be honest, it looked ridiculous. I also knew very little about makeup, so that's possibly a reason. 

lol I even owned a bronzer brush and whatever else, but never figured out how to use it (no one would ever show me!!!!). I also use primer - thanks in part to my boyfriend's advice, and it does help quite a bit! 

Thanks for your tips! :-) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My story:


I was hit by a car when I was a child (3 years of age - 1989 to give you a better idea of the time). Following the accident, I was both mentally and physically impaired. Both of which were apparent to the average person. As so I sought help via plastic surgery (and education...but that's another story). That is a lot to go through as a child and I am doing whatever possible to not seek help from that 'source of perfection'.


That is why I am here.


As you can see, I am rather pale, must draw on eyebrows, and the like, on a daily basis. No matter what I do, I cannot retain much color to my face. Over the past few months, I have experimented with different eye shadows and blush, but nothing seems to work. Also considered changing my hair color, but brown eyes make pairing quite a challenge. (i.e. I LOVE the woman's hair in the Wendy's commercials, but she also has blue eyes, so I'm not so sure if it would work.)


If you have any advice, please feel free to share!


Edit: I've tried darks and lights (hair color) but never seem to know what to do with my overall makeup. Even tried dirty-blonde-streaks back in high school, and to be honest, it looked ridiculous. I also knew very little about makeup, so that's possibly a reason.

Edit 2: Do not fret! I am currently reading through posts and seeing what I can do! This will surely require taking a trip to the mall, but I will use your tips, and fill everyone in on what works! Thank You so much, again! I truly appreciate it! :-) </TEXT>

Edit: yeah I'm not too sure about adding maple syrup. It's too savory of a pancake. It's served with a Tahini Sauce but you have to like sesame seeds.  </TEXT>

Also, if you are wondering about the taste. I'm horrible at describing these things, but the main flavors are curry and garlic. If you're familiar with Middle Eastern food, you'll have a clearer idea of this. I had someone ask and figured other people might wonder the same. </TEXT>
