	<TEXT> I always thought about something in particular that I'd like to share. 

We are a very, VERY new species. We're on our very infancy; if we took all the time Earth has existed and compressed it in 24 hours, civilization exists about 4 miliseconds before midnight. Let alone speak about our time since the Universe itself exists. We, in the cosmic scale, exist for no more than a fraction of the blink of an eye.   

Yet, we have done so much things. We've traveled to our distant moon, and layed pieces of ourselves in other planets. We have already begin to explore our solar system, in so little time.  

What do all things alive want? What's the ultimate instinct of all species? To STAY alive. If you bear that in mind, and also that we have existed for so litte, you'll see that we have yet to evolve a awful lot. I think we'll get to a point in which we'll learn that the best way to survive, is to coopearte with each other. Now, I see that happening in a lot of time, maybe millions of years, but I definitely see that as a real possibility. I believe once we've achieved that point, in which we only wish to survive as a whole species, progress is going to be made a lot, lot faster. We're not as intelligent as we could be, and we know that. Killing ourselves is not the best way to coexist, and maybe one day we'll get pass that. 


Now, if you take into account all these things that I said, maybe we could exist for much much longer, and achieve an understanding of spacetime beyond our dimensions. Maybe we'll discover a form of fuel that lets us travel a lot faster and a lot cheaper. Maybe in a long time we'll be able to actually go to other galaxies, to bend and stretch the dimensions of spacetime to our likehood. It's a possibility that I like to imagine. 

This is why I think it is actually possible to know other civilizations, to enter other galaxies, to spread our species accross the universe. There's also the chance that before that, we annihilate ourselves in the next 500 years, but I like to believe otherwise. Maybe I'm just a fool, or naive, but maybe this isn't so crazy after all. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks a lot! Make sure you post the result :)

Look, I just snapped this upvote with my 10mm lens inverted. It's really fun to make macros with this technique: http://i.imgur.com/46bocpu.jpg </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes! 35mm is a great focal lenght for achieving this. Make sure you open the diaphragm a bit (not fully open). You can do this by sliding to the sides a little metal piece in the back of the lens, which controls the aperture. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is a Nikon 50mm f/1.8 lens inverted on a Nikon D90. 

Inverting lenses that are in the range of normal-wide gives you an incredible amplification and you can get really good macros with it. The 18-55mm and the 18-105mm that come as a kit in basic reflex are great for doing this, at 18mm you get CRAZY magnification.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The guy's just saying her that he wants more, because it hurts having her only as a bootycall (or sorts). That fucking bitch posts this man's pain on Facebook and laughs at it, what the fuck? She even likes her own picture... Definitely nothing wrong with the dude here, although if I were him I wouldn't got together with her after she posted those awful screenshots. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That PCs and notebooks make high pitched noises when showing results or loading things. What the fuck? That would be annoying as fuck.

Also, that nobody presses enter when making a web search, they always go and click "search". No one does that. And don't even get me started on the "enhance that" part when showing security camera footage that has been zoomed 700%, and goes from a blur of 3 pixels to a DSLR 30MPx photo. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is totally true. I saw it happening, I'm a ladybug as well. After this happened, me and the other ladybugs started clapping, and we gave this person %100 ladybug-dollars each.   

We are really happy that the Lord brought us our bug friend. That ladybug's name?

EDIT: I had to edit because right when I was writing this post, my uncle who's a FBI agent entered my house and we had to evacuate because the president Obama was coming to hide (he needed a special place and my house was built with a paint coating that resists even nuclear explosions), and this whole thing made me spell a word wrong, but I can't discuss anything else with you guys, I'm on a plane as we speak on my way to a secret bunker. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I drink beer often, and smoke weed even more regulary. I think it's most because spilling weed feels worst than spilling beer, because of what "it represents" (in terms that weed is more expensive and more difficult to get because of its legal status than beer).

Also, and I'm not saying you're stating this (other comments above are), I don't see why saying you do drugs is a synonim of looking for attention. They're forbidden, yes, but at what point? Beer and marijuana are among the easiest accesible drugs for everyone. The social judgement of them has changed so much that doing them isn't seen as rebellion anymore (weed may be a little more arguable at this point though). I don't think stating that you smoke weed is looking for attention. Sure, lots of teenagers and stupid adults do, but I think they're a minority among drug users.  </TEXT>
