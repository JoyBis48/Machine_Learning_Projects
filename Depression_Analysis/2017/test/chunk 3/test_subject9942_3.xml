	<TEXT> not all champions in the other 4 roles must have some form of cc to be a decent team comp

for example, people would just go that once thresh is picked, he's all the cc they would need

and you're the one that's incompetent </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is about her ult, only

here is a list of champions that CAN'T stop kat's ult:

-Akali
-Caitlyn
-Corki
-Mundo
-Eve
-Ez
-Fiora
-Gankplank
-Graves
-Jinx
-Karma
-Karthus
-Kat
-Kayle
-Khazix
-Kog
-Leblanc (since she lost silence)
-Lucian
-Lux
-Yi
-Miss Fortune
-Mord
-Nasus
-Nidalee
-Nunu
-Olaf
-Rengar 
-Rumble
-Ryze
-Sivir
-Swain
-Talon (since he lost silence)
-Teemo
-Trundle (?)
-Tryndamere
-Twitch
-Varus
-Vlad
-Yorick
-Zed
-Zilean
total: 41/123

champions with UNRELIABLE cc:
-Ahri
-Amumu (must use bandage toss to stop her; his ult does not stop kat)
-Anivia (ice ball is slow, not sure about wall)
-Ashe
-Brand
-Cass
-Elise
-Fizz
-Gnar (must be mega gnar to stop her)
-Heimerdinger
-Irelia
-Kennen
-Morg
-Nocturne
-Shaco
-Shyvana
-Syndra?
-Twisted Fate
-Viktor
-Xerath
-Xin?
-Yasuo
-Ziggs
-Zyra
total:24/123

a grand total of 65/123 champions that cannot be picked

conclusion: just by picking kat (some might argue akali, yi and fiora but roots do stop these champions, unlike kat), you invalidate half the champion pool. Not many of the adcs (not everyone is gonna pick ashe, vayne, tristana or quinn) can stop kat's ult and because adc is necessary, we only get to choose 4 out of 58 champions and it's not even 58 as some are not viable (for example: zac, urgot and galio)
and yes she has high win rate and high banning status (especially in korea, don't know about NA):
http://www.op.gg/statistics/champion/katarina/

my problem with kat, not that I lost to one, is that she is the reason you cannot just pick any champion into any role and well forces picks (mainly support since the support is required to have CC just so you can stop katarina) where as sometimes I want to support with zilean and karma, for example but cannot.

	<TEXT> taric (maybe he is viable?), alistar (better in solo lane or jungle) and lulu(better in solo lane), 
blitzcrank and soraka are binary or situational picks, for example you wouldn't ALWAYS pick blitz, 
thresh (this one is a mix: some will say he's not viable, others will argue he's still relevant; I've just never seen a good one since the last sets of nerfs)

fiddlesticks got nerfed out of viability </TEXT>

	<TEXT> veigar is wasted as a support

and did you not read, karma and zilean are not good picks (despite utility) because they lack cc

so that's 15 and then, not every support is viable so it's less than 15 </TEXT>
