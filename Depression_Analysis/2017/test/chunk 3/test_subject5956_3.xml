	<TEXT> How is that a counter? Once you have an achievement you always have it. So if you are trying to not die one game, you can just get the cs achievement next game. You don't get all the achievements in one game. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Idk about ranked, but AD sion is just insane. The way I play him, I just farm for the first 30-40 minutes, and hope my team doesn't feed too much. Bring cleanse and ghost and just jump in a random team fight and try to win the game. Time spent farming can vary, but the health bonus is very much needed. Also I never go back unless I get killed, I will even ulti to stay in lane if I need to. The way I see it, if you have no kill by midgame they don't build to counter you unless they notice your 400 cs, if they don't counter your build or stop you from farming, you will end up 2 hitting a ziggs, or ulting your team back to full health. </TEXT>
