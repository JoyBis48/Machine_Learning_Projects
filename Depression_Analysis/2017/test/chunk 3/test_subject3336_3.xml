	<DATE> 2014-12-23 13:48:28 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> im wondering if you could replace the tile screenshot's on the new tab page with something like the site's logo or so? Is there any way? Because it kinda seems privacy intrusive when people can actually see image content of sites like facebook and the like, when you open a new tab.  

Also i've noticed most elements are not captured in the screen shot, its like some content has been captured and show and the rest where ignored/left out.

ah i dont quite understand, maybe im wrong here, but its really easy to copy-paste emoji's from http://getemoji.com/  
Just select and copy! :)

Font support is good, but colors are still an issue. Since this seems like it has SVG support, it can work quite well i guess.

Third option is actually what i felt would be good, cross platform OS based or software based support.  
Since Firefox doesn't have a way to input emojis directly into text fields, i felt this could do very well for those who want emoji inputs. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> the story is underwraps so far.  
In a interview "He(lead actor) said that the movie is about modeling industry when a model enters the field not by his own wish, but on compulsion."  

According to rumours(NOT Confirmed) - "it revolves around five persons, a model (Amy Jackson) a doctor(Upen Patel) and three other people who get affected by a poisonous chemical. Reports add Chiyaan(Vikram) will sport a look which will depict a person with his face affected by such chemical."  

Its a teaser, so the plot is still off.
As for the lead actor, he's versatile and professional. An old film of his - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zRVTV1Wy8E

	<TEXT> try looking for a proprietary driver, if the open sourced one is at fault.

http://wireless.kernel.org/en/users/Drivers/b43
http://www.broadcom.com/support/802.11/linux_sta.php

One of these should help your situation :)

Edit:- i searched more through the interwebs:
Enable RPM Fusion repo, or install them if you havn't
Try doing a "yum install kmod-wl"

	<TEXT> im not sure, might be a stupid guess too, but if your network card has a proprietary driver you could try install that and see if your thing works.  Check in windows or so to know your manufacturer  

Also you could try disabling IPv6 support and see if you find some luck  

Edit: Try ifup and ifdown to switch individual cards.

 lspci can list out all the detected cards etc. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> i think this might be website enabled - http://www.fileformat.info/info/emoji/browsertest.htm  

Still black and white; colored ones are images.  
Why didnt emoji's get made in SVG?

EDIT:
Also
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoji

Edit 2:
I think its because you are on Windows and have a color emoji support font installed on the system, My Linux system still shows b w :/ </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Firefox's edge is with the add-ons it has, thats one thing millions of users love. But yes e10s is highly needed to have that edge over chrome again.  

Sometimes i feel e10s should have been a much higher priority in the past itself. FF wouldn't have lost out a good amount of users to chrome. Also risking the add-ons will be a blow to the already using FF users. I think with proper co-ordination and fast paced interaction within the Firefox community can make both e10s and add-on compatibility a great success.  

http://arewee10syet.com/ -- the working add-on list shows good promise, even though there are lots of buggy ones and non tested ones too. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> ah yes, and once the update comes through, same issue.  
Tried new profiles and reset.  
my goto method on linux was disable the e10s autostart on launch thing in about:config and delete the updates folder and relaunch. Somehow it used to update.  

Now it doesnt though :( </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Im sorry to hear that you're having troubles with Firefox.  
I've been using firefox since it's version 1.0+ days.  

My best guess is that you try out to get the latest stable version. Incase you've had it installed, try a browser reset or start a fresh profile.
