	<TEXT> There was nothing groundbreaking or special about Avatar other than the special effects, which are now commonplace in today's movies. I can't see any Avatar sequels making anywhere near the amount of money that the first one made.

However, Star Wars may be the most popular and successful movie franchise of all time. Like you said, its appeal spans multiple generations all across the globe, and a sequel 10 years in the making is not something that no one cares about. 88 *million* was the number of views that second trailer had in *24 hours*. That's amazing. There is no doubt in my mind that its success will be equal to that of Avatar's. </TEXT>

Kubrick's direction

Nicholson's acting

Cinematography

Visuals

Suspense and fear

It had a very Disney-ish feel to it, which helped to bring a sense of wonder and adventure to it. On the other hand, it was probably one of the most cliche movies I've ever seen, and the dialogue was not anything to be proud of. </TEXT>
