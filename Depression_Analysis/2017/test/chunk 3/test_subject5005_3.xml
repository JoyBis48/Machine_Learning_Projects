	<TEXT> I found some more information about this story that is pretty interesting. I've redacted both personal and identifying information, just to be safe with the mods of this sub. I don't know if posting personal information about a dead boy who was never a redditor is an issue but I don't want to get into trouble with the mods. They've let wholeinabucket's comment stand even though he named the boy but I'm not sure if the mods will remove the comment for personal info if and when they see it. This boy killed himself in 1999.

 At one of the largest high schools in North
 Texas, a single gunshot brought grief and shock to students and parents.
 Classes had barely begun Thursday morning at Richland High School in
 North Richland Hills when a young student, described as a loner,
 took his own life. School administrators scrambled to keep school open,
 but many students went home for the day. It happened right after the
 morning bell in a bathroom right off the main lobby. Sophomore [John Doe]
 walked into a stall, pulled out a nine-millimeter pistol, and shot
 himself, once in the head. The student was rushed to a nearby hospital
 where he was pronounced dead.
 
 Freshman [redacted] said, You hear girls crying. Its so sad.
 So sad, people we go to school with. So sad... As news of the tragedy
 spread, anxious parents showed up to claim their children. Some worried
 about how easy it is to bring a gun inside a school with no metal
 detectors. [redacted] is a parent. Theres a firearm in the school.
 Regardless of whether he took his own life or someone elses life, there
 was a gun in the school. School officials say there hasnt been much
 trouble at the school before.
 
 [redacted] is with the Birdville ISD. Im sure this will be
 reviewed. This has not been an issue. Its sort of a fine line you walk,
 do you want metal detectors at all entrances of a high school facility.
 Or is this an isolated incident.
 
 NBC Fives [redacted] reports that police werent the only ones at the
 school after the shooting. About a dozen counselors and volunteer
 chaplains were on hand to help students cope with what happened.
 Theyre meeting one on one and in small groups, talking about the
 tragedy and trying to prevent another one. Reverend [redacted] said,
 Its a big concern because to a lot of young people its a viable
 option. And of course, were telling them its not a viable option. Life
 is worth living. There are people who will help you and love you. The
 pastor says the student who killed himself, [John Doe], had no
 trouble with drugs or girlfriends. But he also says the teenager wrote
 some 8 to 10 letters to friends on Wednesday, which have now been given
 to police.
 
 The ordeal shook up other students who didnt even know the boy, who
 wonder what could have gone so wrong? One student who knew [John Doe]
 described him as being very depressed. The student said [John Doe] never
 played with the other students in gym class.

...

 Diary of a cult member

 By [redacted]
 
 NORTH TEXAS - 16-year-old [John Doe] committed suicide Thursday at
 his high school. Journals he left behind indicate a confused young man
 torn between a dangerous cult and doing what was right. They give a
 frightening look into the world of a teenager who took his own life.
 
 [His parents] say they had no idea their son was so
 torn up inside, not until he killed himself and left behind personal
 notes and a journal describing every day of his life for the past year.
 [His father] says, He was extremely confused. He was being bombarded with
 questions in his head, Whats right, whats wrong, what do I believe,
 what am I doing, what should I do next.
 
 Through words and pictures, [John Doe] described his involvement with a
 so-called Wiccan Cult. The beliefs were far from the traditional Wiccan
 Religion, whose members practice white magic, and encourage harmony with
 nature. His dad says, Its contorted and deformed the way theyve done
 it. Theres nothing good about it. The Wiccan Religion was of good
 things that you can do and anyone that would do evil with it was not
 accepted and they were cast out.
 
 [John Doe], too, was apparently cast out of his group once members realized
 his true intentions, to help others get out. His father found a
 disturbing letter filled with threats from a fellow cult member. [The father]
 says the letter said, We will join together against you, your Catholic,
 anti-atheist group. The letter went on to describe how [John Doe's]
 deviation from the cult would result in a so-called dreamscape trial.
 [John Doe's] step-mom [redacted] says, Entering and attacking a person
 through their dreams. They quote, unquote, kind of call it a dreamscape
 and even if the person doesnt want to participate they can still do
 it.
 
 [John Doe's] journal also described the study of two books: The
 Necrinomicon, or The Book of the Dead, and The Satanic Bible. Some cult
 experts say whatever his intentions, [John Doe] was simply messing with
 something way too dangerous. [redacted] of Watchman Fellowship, Inc.
 says, Theres a lot more to it than maybe they initially believe.
 Rather than just an innocuous investigation or morbid curiosity, they
 actually find themselves being drawn into the lifestyle. A lot of times
 the quest for personal power becomes overwhelming.
 
 Its advice too late for [John Doe], but information his parents hope
 will reach others whom may be lost and searching for answers. [John Doe]s
 family and friends gathered for his funeral in North Richland Hills on
 Monday. Pastor [redacted] told the congregation [John Doe] is now living
 peacefully in heaven.

Why is everyone in this thread offering to send him money to fix up the community center after he already sank money into it, only to then have black people in that area beat the shit out of him and trash the community center?
