	<TEXT> Ah, the great plight of the grey...

To press, or not to press-that is thy question:

Wether tis' nobler to supress

Thy temptation of the button,

To bear witness to other's vibrant blues and greens

Heedful I'll never be blessed with one of my own,

Or take arms against a sea of buttons,

And by opposing end them? To hold: to press;

No more; and by a press to say we end

The heartache the thousand natural shocks

That flesh is heir to,

'Tis a consummation

Devoutly to be wished.

Alas...

Once more into the fray,

Into the last good fight I'll ever know.

Press and repress on this day.

Press and repress on this day. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No wonder we let that colony go

Oh boy, so many corrections needed in just one statement. First of all it was not just *one* colony, but rather thirteen. Second, -well, tell me, when Birtish peope 'give' things away, do they always lose thousands of lives in the process? Because if not, the British didnt so much *give* those thirteen colonies away, as had they them taken away. By force. By most accounts an international embarrassment. Not only that, but they failed to retake those measly thirteen colonies (now states) just a few years later. But you're English, so I'll *give* you the benefit of the doubt (see what I did there? No? Read it again, a little slower this time). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No. Sneak peak is where you get really high up on a mountain or a peak or something so you can spot the spoilers ahead. I believe it gets its name from Tikaboo Peak (sounds a lot like *peak*aboo, right?), in Nevada, where thrill seekers and conspiracy theorists alike will occasionally scale the barren wasteland to *sneak*  a *peek* at the near by Area 51. Get it? They're *sneaking* a *peek* on a *peak*... With a name like 'stealth mountain' I would have expected you to know this. Since then, the term 'sneak peak' has evolved into a few different meanings. The most popular among them meaning 'to get an early look at something that has not yet been released to the public'.

In this instance, I scaled my very thick pile of A Song of Ice and Fire books to catch a glimpse of future spoilers. The expedition was worth it, countless wonders lie at the summit. Unfortunately, all of that hard work is going to become obsolete in about ten weeks. I feel like a librarian. I just spent the last few years of my life sorting metaphorical books (and a few literal books actually), but as soon as I'm done with my life's work the Kindle comes around and suddenly all of my hard work is purposeless ancient history. Oh look, I'm ranting.

Anyhow, that's what 'sneak peak' means. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This literally happened to me once. Me and my friend were hot boxing his car, both at at least a [7] when he checked his phone and said, "Dude! Awesome news!". Oh, how wrong he was. Apparently he had just gotten a text from a girl he was trying to hook up with. She was at an 'ice cream social' and she wanted us to come join. Now at the time this did sound like awesome news. *An ice cream social!* I thought, *I've died and went to stoner heaven!* We drove off in pursuit of the delicious ice cream that awaited us.

On the way there my friend pulled into a church parking lot. Yes, a church. I didn't say anything out loud, but in my head I questioned this. *Had he made a wrong turn? Were we turning around?* Alas, we were not. Apparently, this was where the ice cream social was being held. It was at this point that I began to get worried. I almost didn't go in, but he had already told the girl we were coming, and as a bro I couldn't send him in alone. I retrospect, I totally could have and definitely should have.

Immediately upon entering I recognized many of the people there from my school. I realized I had no idea what type of group this was, so I decided to ask the girl we came to see. "Wait, he didn't tell you?" she says, "This is my churches youth group" Fuck. Fucking fuckity fuck fuck fuck fuck. Before I had time to burst out of the front doors an old woman summoned all of us to the center of the church in some sort of religious pow wow. No no no. Must. Leave. Now. Must. Find. Friend. Too late. He's already sitting down. FUCK. I run over and grab the seat next to him, all the while begging him to rush the exit with me. Again, too late. The room was silent, the old lady was taking roll call.

"Brian"

"Here"

"Sarah"

"Here"

"Kevin"

"Here"

Shes reading from a list. Thank god. Maybe she won't even notice us. Nope. That would be too easy, wouldn't it? Instead she says, "Oh! And I see we have some first timers here! Care to introduce yourself?" *FUCK NO, EVIL RELIGION LADY!!* I was high, don't judge me.

There was a silence. A silence that lasted much, much, much too long. I looked at my friend, and he looked back at me, both preying the other would answer. And then he did something that I will not forgive him for to this day. He reached in his pocket, and pulled out his phone. Instead of answering, he flipped open his phone and started texting away. I looked up. Old Lady McGee was staring directly into my eyes. I had to speak.

"Uh, hi. My name is test_subject3655"

Someone laughs. *Fuck youuuuuuuuuuuuu.* She smiles. "And why are you here today, test_subject3655?" she asks.

What?! This is a fucking interview?? I glanced back at my friend, still texting away. Shit, I was alone on this one. *Fucking hell!!! Wait, you're in a church, don't think stuff like that.* Again, I was pretty fucking high. "Um, yeah I think I just came for the ice cream." Silence. Complete, dead, silence. Not even a comforting cricket chirping away, utter silence.

"...alright." she says, before mercifully moving on to some other topic. We sat through another half hour of this before making a break for the door. Everyone knew. EVERYONE. Even Old Lady McGee probably knew. Never, ever ever again. Ever, ever, ever.

**TL;DR: Went to an ice cream social high as fuck, turned out to be a church youth group, got interviewed by an old religious lady in front of everyone.** </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I actually hate Five Finger Death Punch, this is an unbiased opinion. The fact that they're a heavy metal band is almost irrelevant, they play the song as rock. And there is absolutely no screaming, the closest they get would be the harmony during the chorus I guess. But like I said before, a piano isn't an instrument that can capture the message behind this song. There are many other songs where it can, but not this one. The Doors or Styx are good examples of song writing and composition that is perfect for a piano componet. Bad Company (the song, not the band) isn't. Its simply too mild where the song is too rugged. Kind of like playing Back in Black with a ukulele. Sure you can do it, and it will probably sound pretty cool too, but it will never compare to the raw power and passion behind the orginal song.

None of this means Bad Company is a bad original song, just that it could be better.

EDIT: Not sure why you're down voting me over a petty debate... When it comes down to it its an opinion, you shouldn't despise someone just because you disagree with them. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I disagree, while it might ruin the mood of the orginal tempo, it captures the essence of the song much, much better. Its a song about breaking away from societal norms and rejecting modern customs (with regard to aggression mostly). The original version dosnt capture that at all. Five Finger Death Punch's does a much better job conveying that message and in a much more powerful way. Bad Company isn't a simple easy going song, its powerful and gritty and rugged. Where Bad Company missed the mark, Five Finger Death Punch nailed it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> [Bad Company] (https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=u_VsvZmIWxY) by Five Finger Death Punch. Oddly enough, Bad Company by Bad Company is a little bit of a let down after this version.

Also the Jimi Hendrix version of [All Along the Watchtower] (https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=TLV4_xaYynY). Devlin and Ed Sheeran did [a cool cover of that too] (https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=iDRJwCSEcoA). A cover of a cover. Coverception.

[Fall Out Boy] (https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=sk8Pb17pcQI) and [Alien Ant Farm] (https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=CDl9ZMfj6aE) both did surprisingly awesome Michael Jackson covers.

A band called Framing Hanley did [a cover of Lil Wayne's 'Lolipop'] (https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=vbUR0SRceD0). Its an interesting fusion of genres. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Holy shit, my heart rate still hasn't returned a healthy level. Am I the only one who read this wrong and went running to my TV, then remembered I don't have HBO and ran back to my computer, went to the HBO GO website (ready to pay literally any amount at all), got confused when HBO GO wasn't a thing yet because it was promised to be in time for Game of Thrones, spent about ten minutes researching HBO GO on the internet, went back to Reddit to find answers, discovered none of this was relevant because I don't live in Georgia, and got a paper bag to practice some deep breathing exercises?? Yes? Well consider yourself lucky. </TEXT>

I would have stopped it but he flew up to the Empire State Building where King Kong caught it and ripped it to shreds with his giant gorilla hands. And then a thousand smaller Pterodactyls flew in and ate all of the tiny pieces. Which sucks because this is like the third time that this has happened." </TEXT>
