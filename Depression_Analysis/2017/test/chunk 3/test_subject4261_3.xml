	<TEXT> The UK was at war, at most, two years longer than the US. And regardless, the UK's infrastructure in regards to factories was A) bombed to shit, and B) not as large as the US's in the first place. It had nothing to do with who was where longer. It had to do with the fact that the US had the highest manufacturing ability in the world. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Empire is actually my favorite of the Total War series. I downloaded a mod called Minor Factions Revenge that allows me to play as minor factions. Venice is a lot of fun. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My license. I dropped it three days after I got it while I was at school and was too embarrassed to tell my parents. Three months later, coincidentally on the very same day that I got my car, my principal called me down and handed me my license saying that a janitor had turned it in. </TEXT>
