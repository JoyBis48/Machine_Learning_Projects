	<TEXT>  That's a silly argument: up until very recently, "Western values" were decidedly anti-gay.

I didn't make it up

You have to understand this.

Gays and gay rights are seen as intrusions of western values and virulently opposed. You have to remember how skeptical a lot of these places are to any sort of outside influence, especially culturally at this point. ***To them***, being anti-gay is a positive aspect of their society. 


Because they've been taught to feel that. People who are raised without the hatred, who have gay couples in their lives, do not feel "viscerally uneasy" in the slightest. The idea that people are born with hatred or "disgust" for same-sex interactions is utterly absurd.

I didn't say they were or were not taught anything. I'm telling how things are in different parts of the world.

You're not going to get anywhere by just thinking hitting over the head with your value systems will work without understanding why they're so stubborn to listen to you in the first place. So yeah, a lot of straight people aren't just drawn to images of gay people "being gay"...No matter how many gay people they have in their family or interact with. This isn't even about tolerance. Its about things you see that bother you. And a lot these cultures haven't had the references to understand how to view things they disagree with without respectfully disagreeing with it. Their answer is brutal repression and not tact or tolerance. Tolerance isn't something you find in 3rd world countries who can't even find the tolerance to fix their communities and solve overarching problems.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> **Do you really not understand this?**

Step outside if the ivory tower of liberal academia and step into the real and visceral world outside of your 1st world trappings

These people just HATE gays. 

It has nothing to do with their insecurity. It has everything to do with religiosity and flat out disgust of gay people

Hell, most heterosexual people I know don't *love* gays...they tolerate them in the sense that "it doesn't bother me" and they don't want them to be persecuted. Most heterosexuals I know just generally ignore it. But that doesn't mean they enjoy watching two dudes kiss or anything. It does viscerally make people feel uneasy. But thats besides the point. 

We're talking about cultures that haven't even secure the basics yet in the modern world...that are hyper-masculine (as a function of survival) and see any threat to the masculinity and thus perceived strength of their people as an utter and vile threat to the greater good. 

This has NOTHING to do with secretly being gay.

This has NOTHING to do with being insecure with your sexuality. 

Theres a reason the world map looks like this: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_rights_by_country_or_territory

Most of the world really does not value western ideals and rejecting homosexuals is seen as tossing off the weight of "liberalism" and "secularism" in these very traditional and insular cultures and communities.

Does this mean you have to agree?

No.

But it DOES mean that you'll have to do A LOT better in coming up with quick one-word responses to anything a "homophobe" (and gays need a better word than homophobe to be honest) has to say with respect to gay rights.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Actually, its not.

People just actually hate gays...and they don't see it as it having no effect on their lives. They see it as something they reject and want to not have to deal with it. I'm not a homophobe or anything so this doesn't bother me, but if you don't understand how they think or why they think it, you'll forever be confused. 

There are lazy arguments about AIDS and pedophilia and general visual discomfort in viewing gays in public that pervade all anti-gay societies around the world

Not every person who hates gays craves gay sex. Its stupid to even think that.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> **We should abandon this notion that anyone who hates gays is therefore secretly gay**.

Is it true in many cases? Absolutely.

But there is a culture within Africa and ex-colonial states around the world (partly due to colonialism) that views western social values as vestiges of oppression and colonialism and emasculation...and anti-homosexuality is seen as an effort to regain a sense of confidence and stability in society. I  have heard the arguments too ranging from "The greeks brought homosexuality to africa" and "gays keep AIDS around" and the very common "gays aren't real men"...and you have to understand that these are just people who are trying to deal with the basics in life (the average citizen) and having to then conform to these notions of gender and try to maintain a degree of tolerance while doing so is VERY difficult. 

I'm not saying its right, but you have to understand this. It goes far beyond secretly "hating yourself"  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It DID however put one suspect on probation for trying to go to a terrorist training camp 5 years ago.

You can't arrest someone with pre-crime e.g. "you're going to jail because we think you'll try and kill infidels 5 years from now" </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Why isn't it possible for ISIS to have done this?

1. muslims get mad at mohammed pics

2. young angry muslims see whats going on online and want to join in

3. just so happens one of the suspects was being tracked by the feds for trying to go to an overseas camp.... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The NSA is getting so saturated with data that it's become useless for actually stopping, avoiding and lowering the essential reason it was created for: terrorism/acts of violence in America.

This isn't true.

See, predicting crime is hard unless you truly catch someone in the act. In Texas last week, the problem was that one of the suspects was already on probation essentially for being tracked to going overseas to train at a camp...but you can't arrest someone for suspicion of committing an terrorist act in the future.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Its SO frustrating.

ATL could AT LEAST resemble Boston. DC if we were ambitious. 

But no.

They CONTINUALLY stand in the way of literal progress in the metro area. 

This is why I suggest ATL just cannibalize everything inside 285 and be done with it.  </TEXT>
