	<TEXT> He doesn't really do a lot of fast action stuff except for the small amount of fighting at the end (that he doesn't do very well in). I'm sure you can get a clean, smooth picture but I'm most worried about the lag making it impossible to play shooters or faster paced games. Thanks anyways though.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think it's time to look into the pros and cons of using each product in real life rather than just the pros and cons of the computers themselves. If you're gonna be bringing it to class, the Alienware is going to be WAY too huge. I'd go with the blade. In my experience with college, portability and battery life are just SO incredibly important. If you do get the Alienware I would look into also getting a companion tablet or light netbook for you to bring to class with the money you save. They're both great computers that serve slightly different purposes (powerful all around computer vs. desktop replacement). Make your call while considering your lifestyle (do you plan on sitting in your room or going to the library to do work, lan parties with friends, etc.) and how you plan on using your computer (take it to class or leave it in your room). 

Also, technically it's not their first PC, as they have the Razer Blade Pro that was released a few years ago.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The Blade Pro is an outdated system by now. The new Razer Blade is the one you want to get. Switchblade is an old gimmicky system that most games don't support and is a feature I'd pay to get RID of, not to have. There's a reason they haven't updated the Pro/added Switchblade to the new Razer Blade.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This keyboard is AMAZING, much better than any membrane or chiclet keyboard in my opinion. The only downside is it's VERY loud, really clacky especially if you type fast (of courss, this could be seen as an upside to most people). If you have roommates or if you think you'll be bothered by the sound I'd recommend asking for the Steath version which uses different switches to be quieter. Personally, it doesn't bother me or my roommate and I kinda like the sound it makes. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes, I LOVE this keyboard, I had the 2012 model before and just recently upgraded to this one (2013) with the Cherry MX Blues. It is very noisy, and I do have one roommate. Fortunately, he doesn't seem to mind it unless he's trying to sleep and I'm still up typing something. I guess it just depends on who you have as a roommate.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, I re-installed windows and didn't install the beats audio drivers after. Honestly, beats doesn't sound all that bad on my laptop; I even think it makes the sound from the built-in speakers sound better. You can disable the equalizer and tweak the bass and stuff so it doesn't sound bad. 

But yes I do have it completely uninstalled and it sounds pretty much the same.  </TEXT>

I actually have my laptop dual-booted for Ubuntu, which I prefer over Windows 8 for web browsing and stuff like that. When I want to game I switch over to Windows.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It uses a lot less bandwidth than Skype does, so in that sense it's better. Whether you like the sound quality is up to personal preference; Razer Comms tries to make your voice stand out above in-game audio but it can make it sound a little harsh and unnatural in my opinion. Just try it out and see what you think! </TEXT>
