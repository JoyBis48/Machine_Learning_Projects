	<TEXT> Not sure if this is the appropriate sub for this or not, but the one and only Bruce Campbell will be at this years comic con and I'm a huge evil dead fan. This was enough to spark my interest and get me really excited about attending this year. Now I should add that I've never attended one of these before so please forgive my noobishness. 

I'd really like to know what Bruce is like for those of you whom have met him, I am not really the nervous type but have a feeling he'll set me back a step. More importantly what's the etiquette for getting stuff signed? Can you bring more than one item if any at all? Or do they make you purchase while inside?

I think that about sums it up, it's going to be really cool to meet a guy like Bruce, even if it is only for a minute. Thanks in advance dreddit. Again sorry if wrong sub.

	<TEXT> Dude, I've had a girl tell me this exact same thing, then even go as far as naming the baby girl after my Mother. I didn't think I could afford a paternity test at the time, and thought it wasn't worth it because you know, she named her after my mom and all. My brother who was much more established than I was at the time insisted on paying for the test, lo and behold the baby wasn't mine. I was surprised at first even though it was only a one night stand deal that turned into a few more times afterwards, but apparently this chick was going through a really bad break up and this was her way of coping, obviously not filling me in on the details.

Either way, I didn't mean to bore you with the details seeing how you are probably in a much different situation, but goddammit, that paternity test changed my life. Please do yourself the favor before doing anything else.

That was 11 years ago and I am currently happily married with an 18 month old boy, and a girl on the way. I'm really not sure if any of that would have come to fruition had I taken her word for it. Speaking of which, I should call my brother, what an awesome guy.

	<TEXT> My son is about to turn 18 months next week and he still doesn't walk. He did however start the spider walk yesterday (feet flat on the floor, legs straight, and moving forward with his hands) so I'm hoping that's a good sign. I was having this same question/thought plague my mind the other day, and I keep asking myself if I am doing anything wrong. 

On that note, it sounds like your son is doing fine, the whole army crawling thing is just another variation of crawling I believe, I watched a niece of mine develop the same way and she turned out to be a very smart and sweet little girl (age 7 now). I remember thinking it was peculiar, but it was just another developmental step before she was up and running. Otherwise everything else sounds right on par. Enjoy it while you can, babies are so sweet, I will miss these days I just know it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I try asking him what's wrong, but he doesn't really have a grasp of the English language yet, only uses a few words. But I make sure to talk to him as much as I can, pointing and naming everything in sight. I'm hoping for that language explosion any day now. 

As for stomping feet he still doesn't walk, however when he gets frustrated with his toys for whatever reason he will let out a squeal and throw a small tantrum until one of us can help him out. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have no idea honestly, it seems to be some sort of play fighting. I know his intent is fairly harmless, but it needs to stop either way. He is a really active child, we have a hard time keeping up with him, he has no interest in television and loves to drive his cars around on the floor and dance to music, I doubt it's an surplus of energy. I'm hoping it's some sort of phase that will dissipate as he develops his sense of empathy. </TEXT>

I know he doesn't know any better and that he may even have a hard time understanding me, and that this is method I use probably isn't going to be effective in the long term. 

Thanks so much for your thoughtful reply, I will definitely try it out. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Preventing my 17 month old son from hitting, grabbing, and pulling hair. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-01-20 18:54:20 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hello /r/parenting, I'm so glad I found you this past week. I can tell I have much to learn from you guys and I look forward to growing with you. Having said that, I am new to fatherhood with my 17 month old son, and his soon to be born baby sister. So far I am having a blast, with all the ups and downs, all I know is I wouldn't change it for the world and that this has been the best experience of my life so far.

The reason I come to you guys with this post is that currently my son has started to hit really hard, he has always had a thing for pulling my wife's hair, but now he's doing both to us. I really don't know how to react when he does this, should I be firm and tell him no? Or should we try not to draw any attention to it. So far I've been doing my best to make him understand that it hurts and that he shouldn't do it, but it's seemingly having no effect.

I'd really like to know how to deal with this especially before our little girl enters the situation and becomes another victim. Thank you so much for any help you can offer.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Fucking halo made me get the Xbone, even though it isn't even out yet. Regardless, when my PS3 dies as my current media server, and the price is right, I'll replace it with the PS4.

The fact that they are both lack backwards compatibility really irks me all the same, Street Fighter Alpha 3 for the PS is one of my all time favorite games, so if my PS3 ever does bite the dust I don't know what I'll do.

EDIT: I called every future shop/wal mart/best buy/visions ect ect. in the city when I tried to purchase the Xbone and there was zero availability if that means anything. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Although his/her answer was thorough and awesome, s/he did allude to Calgary being more of a white collar town, which is really not the case. Maybe on the surface it would appear that way, but there are many trades for one to get into. Even with only a high school diploma, you could definitely get your foot in the door as a pipe fitter and make a great living in a few years. Do you know people in either town or surrounding areas? That would be the biggest deciding factor for me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Good old Sook Yin, I used to have a huge crush on her growing up. I seriously miss the 90's MuchMusic format, back when the programming actually covered music, and music related subjects. Yes, we live in a different era and they have to pander to what sells, I'm just disappointed. Please don't link me to the MTV guy ranting to people like me.

I thought she did a decent job with the interview, maybe a tad nervous, but that probably comes from being a big fan. I thought Maynard handled the tool related questions just fine, he more or less finger pointed towards the other guys at the end there, but that's nothing new.

	<TEXT> I had a small click of friends that slowly expanded throughout high school, some of my expansion pack friends were more popular and went to parties with people who I generally didn't associate with (jocks and preps I believe were the terms we used back then). I recall going to one of these parties (somewhere around 1998), where the booze kicked in and I had the balls to stop the music that was currently playing, whatever it was I remember it being terrible. Either way I remember dropping on aenima that I had brought (I never left the house without 15-20 cd's and a discman in my backpack). I was expecting contorted faces of disgust and hatred, however stinkfist kicked in and everyone seemed to mesh to it, and it was awesome. Then I thought to myself, ok, this will all change when Die Eier Von Satan comes on. Waited patiently for that industrial German racket to begin with my troll face in gear. Again, a room full of people from all clicks just had the best time, it was the first time I think I realized that maybe it was me who was the asshole and not everyone else. It's like I shed a layer of hatred that night.

I have no idea why I just replied to your message with this.

EDIT: Grammar/additional info. </TEXT>
