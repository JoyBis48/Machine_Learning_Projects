	<TEXT> My wife and I own a house and some land in Amherst, MA.  We've lived here since the 1960s.  We love it.  It's racially diverse (I'm white an my wife is Korean), a great place to have a family and grow up (my kids stayed in Amherst and they have their own kids now).

I'm 63, I'll retire in a couple years.  My wife and I have talked about moving to someplace warmer because it's so frikking cold here in the winter.  This last winter was especially bad.  But all of our family are here and it would be a burden to them for us to move away, so I think we'll stay.  Besides, we have a huge house and lots of land.  My wife is an avid organic gardener and we have fruit trees, berry bushes and several gardens.  I'd hate to give that up.

I can't speak about small business ownership.  I work at a couple of the local hospitals which have their issues in management, but overall are excellent.

Like I said, I've owned property in Amherst since it was cheap.  It's very expensive now, but you can find more affordable real estate in Belchertown, which is not too far from here, or South Hadley which is a bit farther, but also a very nice place to live (my youngest daughter lives there with her girlfriend - yes it's gay friendly).

Hope it helps </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I read news headlines from a dozen sources including /r/news (yeah I know, right?) and trust nothing.

I like a lot of what [James Corbett](http://reddit.com/r/CorbettReport) has to say, but of course he's not "news".  I read my local papers online "breaking news" pages, and have the [Breaking News](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.breakingnews) app on my android.

For lels, I like [GLP](http://www.godlikeproductions.com/forum1/pg1) and [/pol/](https://boards.4chan.org/pol/)

	<TEXT> 1.  Get a good mandolin teacher

2.  Make sure he/she is a mandolin player, not a guitarist that can "pick a few tunes" - you want someone that plays and teaches mandolin

3.  Learn to read music.  Sure you can learn tab too, but if you're going to play with others, music is the best form to use

4.  Find a teacher that also leads a good mandolin group so you can learn to play the instrument, and play in a group setting </TEXT>
