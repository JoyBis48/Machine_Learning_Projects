	<TEXT> Neither of those were really directed at you - the first obviously because you're not hideous and gross. The second means that the man in question is backing off and not displaying his (still ever-present) interest because he is getting none from the girl in return. Most guys are interested in all females they know (that meet the attractiveness of point one) all the time, and are simply hedging their bets by showing only their interest in those who respond the most. There is no 'friend zone' or non-attractiveness-related reasons for lack of interest, as there often is from the female perspective. As you're displaying a lot of interest (I certainly hope you are) you don't have this problem.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is what I struggle with the most about r/seduction - the ideal presented, and what women seem to find attractive, is frankly repulsive to me. I actually want to be a nice guy. I want to help people. I want to be friends with them. I DON'T want to spend every second of my life being superior, or a 'leader,' or the most aggressive caveman. I sure as hell don't want to treat women like objects. 

I've spent a fair bit of time here trying to reconcile the two philosophies, without much success. If I remain celibate for life and not a repulsive douchebag, so be it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> After the open-ended question, ask more questions to uncover specific details. Then share something related about yourself/your viewpoint on the subject. Rinse and repeat. 

E.g: what did you do this weekend? I went skiing.
- I didn't know you like skiing. How long have you been doing that for?
- was it fun? Any exciting stories? (moderate effectiveness depending on what you're actually asking about)
-  where did you go? What was it like there?
- is skiing hard?

Then:

- the last time I went skiing, I nearly got eaten by a carp. Crazy, right?
- I've heard a lot about skiing but never tried it. What about it is so fun? (great question if the person is really passionate about the given topic)
- my wife loves skiing. You should go together sometime.
- have you tried (skiing place)?

These all vary according to your level of knowledge of the subject, but a good rule of thumb is that if you don't know what they're talking about, encourage them to explain and teach you. If you do, share expertise/viewpoints/stories etc. Learn further. Note that it is **very** important not to talk too much about your own perspectives, especially when talking about something like politics.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Does she ignore you or not talk to you? The difference is very important. 

If you're trying to talk to her and she is being noncommittal, one word answers, trying to get away etc - ignoring you - then she is clearly not into you at all, and asking her out will only lead to great embarrassment. 

If she just doesn't come up and talk to you because you're not that good friends, or because she has higher priorities (other friends that you mentioned) then there's nothing wrong. She just doesn't know you well enough to have a reason to talk to you. While a lot of people are advocating to straight up ask her out, and this attitude is definitely what you need, I'd still advise testing the waters a little bit - find some reason to make conversation with her and see how she reacts (ask her to help you with some schoolwork etc). If she responds in a friendly manner - and not in the way I described in the first paragraph - all signals go. Balls to the wind, ask her out, and hopefully she says yes. 

If she politely turns you down, don't be offended. You're not right for each other and she knows it. The same applies for if she is properly ignoring you as above. If she rejects you nastily, then she's a Class A bitch that you definitely don't want to be with, and you've just dodged a bullet. 

Good luck! </TEXT>
