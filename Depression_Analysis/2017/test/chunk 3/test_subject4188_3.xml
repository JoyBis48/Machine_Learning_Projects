	<TEXT> Yeah but comics go where no episodes can but I wonder how this will be filmed, probably in HD so will look great but hope it's still on film and does not look too stale, the great thing about the series is it had a certain look to it, light and dark, funny and sombre, it had it all </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah and it's not just Wikileaks but films like Loose Change, Zeitgeist and everything in between, but 6 episodes is limiting and it would only scratch the surface depending how the writers have done it

I wonder if the new comic book series will influence the episodes? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> New Series Theories </TITLE>

	<TEXT> I get a cold war feel when viewing some older episodes especially the one with the submarine

When Mulder ran around outside it was so dark and foggy and very unnerving

The tension of the set pieces and the music really added depth to average scenes

Really hope the new mini series adds very post 9/11 and interconnected paranoia to the series as I know it's only six episodes but they all need to have a powerful message of current states of affairs </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Would be great to have a section dedicated to vintage DJ sets that were spun on vinyl

Here's a stunning set from Paul van Dyk at Mayday in 2000

	<TEXT> Yeah his mix from Smack My Bitch Up into Adagio For Strings is very creative, the album was great yeah but it was more a laid back album instead of the driving euphoric stuff </TEXT>
