	<TEXT> I absolutely agree, and I definitely will be out and about during this trip. However, I'm a very techy person so anything with lights and sounds amuses me extremely while tripping aha </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Totally normal. You may find that anything you drink or eat will be masked with the taste while tripping, also. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't think it's that simple.

There will always be slang. There's slang for marijuana and look how close to legalization that is. Whether you think it's wrong or not, I'll call it whatever the hell I want. Lucy is a slang term and its used right in the fuckin' sidebar. Preach to someone who gives a shit, lad. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's shitty. I went to take a walk for like two hours just because it was killing me and now I'm back in my room. I just can't fall asleep, I just want to fast forward to when we can try again. I'm so upset with myself. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> See, I love horror, but I love letting myself become absorbed the the world the movie is showing me. So I basically let myself believe what's happening on the screen to enjoy it more. This is what I'd be worried about while tripping </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's funny because this is pretty much me during playtime with these characters. I feel like there wasn't enough testing in this side of the game, I don't know. Just my opinion. It's somewhat difficult to control them fluently. I mean, I can lure enemies fine and pussy-foot through a scene but I want it to look cool! It's not easy to look cool with these guys unless by luck. But maybe that's just me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I remember waking up and the first thing I read from PC Gamer was "GTA V on PC delayed again..."

A heavy and emotional sigh ensued. </TEXT>
