	<TEXT> I haven't been yet, but my SO and I have reservations to Akershus in the Norway Pavilion in May and that looks pretty good. They have a cold bar that everyone has access to and then a nice looking menu you order from. The cold bar has some shellfish, cured meats and cheeses from Scandinavia. There are some wonderful sounding Scandinavian entrees as well that we are excited about! I should mention that Akershus is a Princess meal. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Why do I owe a huge amount on my taxes this year when my income and withholding is unchanged? [USA] </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Background: I make less than 25K, single lady with no kids. I am not in school, I work full time for a public university. GREAT benefits. 

I owe $470 on my tax return. This is a substantial amount of money for me, and it's going to decimate the small savings I have managed to put by. Last year, I got a small refund. My income and withholding, as stated, has not changed. I'm confused and sad. :( 

I just put everything through a Federal Free Edition on Turbotax, and my only credit was for Student Loan Interest. 

TLDR: ELI5 why it's different so I don't get pissy and mail off a bunch of pennies. Please and thank you. 3

Edit- Changed deduction to credit </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You have to cancel these at least 24-48 hours in advance, so maybe someone is sitting on a reservation until it gets closer and they have to really decide which they want. Keep trying!
