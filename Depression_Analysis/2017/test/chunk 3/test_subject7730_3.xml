	<TEXT> All I have to say is that, a good story excutes on a few basic points. Character development, conflict, suspense, and the resolution. All this were either non-existent, half-assed or just plain unsatisfying. I just don't understand how so many people could like the movie. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Green place confused me, but I guess what I'm trying to say is that, if I remember correctly, where the water was being kept...just above that...there was grass and whatnot and that's where the main female character ended up in the end when they were going up the 'elevator' contraption. Also, WHY do they want to go to the greenland in the first place, didn't get that either. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No man, They did him right in my opinion. Granted, I never read comic books at all so I don't know exactly the in's and out's of Kingpin's character but I get the essence of him. And I feel like they took a comic character and made him a REAL human being. Also, the reason he was a 'numbskull' was that he truly fell in love and it changed him. I think we will definitely get a more darker Kingpin in the future of the show though which would be cool to see. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Where do I begin. I hated the orange filter over the film, Tom Hardy doesn't even talk, they didn't really introduce the setting or environment for those who have never seen a mad max film before (like me), the conflict at hand was sort of confusing, they drive for about an hour in one direction only to drive back, their were probably more explosions than words spoken and dare I say that the transformer movies that people shit on had more of a story and coolness factor than this movie, they want to see the green place or whatever the fuck but you see the grass on top of the pillars in the beginning of the movie, this movie could have been over in 13 minutes had they seen the grass on the top of the pillars, OHHH and if the mass majority lived without water and power why the fuck don't they revolt, how did the world become the sahara desert, what is the world like on other continents, and lastly the story was absolutely non-existent which kind of pisses me off and I am not hard to please when it comes to movies, but this is one of the few movies that I've ever truly hated and it disgusts me that people drool over it and honestly demand more movies like it.

TL;DR: Mad Max is garbage. Don't get sucked into the hype. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It depends...If you run in the direction of the earth spin you would stay in the same place in space (therefore it would take 24 hours). However, if you run the in the opposite direction of the earth spinning then you would actually take only 12 hours. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not gonna downvote you, no one should. You have your opinion. I'm not trying to make a choice between the hosts and Wings (or say that one side is bad) but I just really miss the old fun spontaneous times ya know. I just watch alot of old PKA's out of nostalgia and it kinda sucks that Wings, arguably the life of the show, is gone. WE WILL NEVER SEE THE OLD CAST TOGETHER EVER, which really upsets me. Anyways, Murka and Kyle are great. I'll keep watching until those two are gone. </TEXT>
