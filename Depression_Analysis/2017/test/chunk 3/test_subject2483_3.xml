	<TEXT> Hey r/investing!
I have to write a mathematics essay (Math Internal Assessment for the IB), and at the moment I am trying to formulate a question. Since the stock market is very interesting, I was curious, what mathematics is used to "predict" share price movements. Any relatively complex maths is enough, even if it is completely wrong (I assume many mathematics formulaes, etc. in predicting the stock market are wrong). Any help would be helpful! Thanks so much! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> even to (any country) in "x years" the (country) would look alien in "x years +400). Go an read more about the actual religion and culture the (country) and people dressed and what they did for fun and compare that to (country) during the days of (any leader in year year x). It is a continuation but it changed more that enough to be called a different.

I suggest France as a good country. But can apply to pretty much any country. Not trying to argue here, just pointing out that this argument you put forward can be applied to almost any country. </TEXT>
