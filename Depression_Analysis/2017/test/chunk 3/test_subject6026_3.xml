	<TEXT>  I believe the toys didn't free them, just brought them together. When purple guy is killed they finally get their revenge and are freed. I also think the original child (The Puppet) was killed in fredbear's which is probably why they were so quick to sell to Fazbear Entertainment. That's just what I think though. We'll probably never know all the answers to the story, we just have to work with what we have. </TEXT>
