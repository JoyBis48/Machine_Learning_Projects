	<TEXT> The socialist elements of Naziism were purged in the Night of the Long Knives.

Communists yes but the Nazis were socialists and viewed Communists as competitors. Hitler did not like Communists because they were too internationally focused and had too many Jews as members.

Regardless of the rumors of the Nazi leadership's beliefs, they still had to mobilize the Christian German population.

How does mobilizing Christian support make the Nazis Christian?

The reasons for choosing Jews as the scapegoat are probably complex, but antisemitism has a long history in Europe, and its almost undeniably religious in origin.

Antisemitism has a long history, there is no evidence that the Nazis were influenced into antisemitism by any Christian doctrine.

	<TEXT> A lot of people have that opinion, or at least that their motives are hardly in line with any popular interpretation of Islam. I could say they are to Muslim extremism what the Nazi party was to Christian extremism. 

ISIS is motivated 100% by extremist Muslim views. The Nazis were socialists and  atheists and were not influenced by the Christian religion at all. 

Perhaps the military budget is being cut because drones are supplanting many of the roles our military has been serving in the region. 

How can you suggest that? Drones are great as an adjunct tool to combat terrorists and I support their use but they are not replacements for a strong and supported military. Obama has pursued huge cuts in the military and pursued policies that have allowed ISIS to expand and the losses of Libya, Yemen, and most of Iraq and Syria to Muslim extremists.  </TEXT>

continuation of Bush domestic terror policies

See above

more money on the border

Huh? Do you realize he has directed ICE and Homeland Security to open the borders? Remember all of the refugees from central America?

Guantanamo is still open

	<TEXT> Except government does not give $500 tax credits. Instead, government stimulus involves large payments to political allies such as union building projects. Very few industries benefit as a result to the extent that it warrants expansion. 

Supply side economics views tax cuts and regulatory relief as tools that stimulate industries because they know their fixed costs will be less and predictable. This stimulates them to expand to both capture a larger market share of existing markets and expand into new markets. 

The fact is that Keynesian economic models only stimulate limited parts of the economy and do so for very limited periods. Businesses are unlikely to invest capital to expand when they know that government stimulus is temporary.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There is no such thing as trickle down economics or voodoo economics. 

Supply side economics in a nutshell is the belief that making industry cheaper via less regulation and lower taxes stimulates expansion and increased hiring. 

Keynesian (aka Liberal) economics  in a nutshell is the belief that public spending stimulates expansion and increased hiring. 

Both theories are based on the belief that giving cash to either the public or private sector will improve the economy. 

If one is against supply side economics then they must also be against Keynesian economics.  Both are "trickle down" economic models  </TEXT>

WWII was a brutal war that involved millions of combatants. Rapes were bound to occur by and against all citizens involved. Clearly though, the number of rapes committed by allied soldiers were perpetrated by a tiny minority. The rapes committed by the soviets were widespread and systematic. They were part of a policy of revenge. The two allied side's rape histories during WWII cannot be considered equal  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Historically, socialism has caused  the deaths of over one hundred  million innocent people over the past century. Enforcement of socialist policies by socialist governments has required the use of terror and violence.   

If you were taught that socialism has been a success then your teachers have been teaching political indoctrination and not history.

All one has to do is compare western style representative governments with socialist governments to see which system is superior in terms of improving the human condition and human life.

Just honestly compare the facts. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you for responding. I suspected you were young because of your previous comments. As a student of history with college/university several degrees, I encourage you to continue your education. History is a fascinating subject as it offers a clue of what we can expect of the future. That clue only exists though if we search for facts and not political indoctrination.

The study of socialism is an interesting field but one that is rife with political falsehoods. If that aspect of history interests you then you should pursue it further with an eye towards avoiding non factual political influences.

Socialism has failed miserably wherever it has been tried. As an Aussie, you should honestly compare the histories of socialist states with your own productive and fair society.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> haha what? Mussolini and Hitler were facists, the exact opposite of communists.

Hitler and Mussolini were fascists AND socialists. Fascism and Naziism were forms of socialism. Nether were Communists and both viewed Communists as socialist rivals.

Pol Pot was not a marxist

He was a socialist though

 He (Castro) liberated Cuba from a dictator and now Cubans enjoy a higher standard of living and longer life expectancy than any country in south and central America.

Then why are so many Cubans risking their lives to escape Cuba? Why does Cuba need a secret police or political prisons? Why are Cubans prevented from freely associating, protesting, and traveling out of the country?

Mao was an interesting guy, but I'm curious why you would think he is bad?

Please look up Mao's "cultural revolution" and other socialist policies  http://necrometrics.com/20c5m.htm#Mao </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Socialism is a system that looks good on paper but always fails in practice because ultimately, the state must use coercion and violence to force everyone to comply. The Soviets had to use violence and starvation to enforce compliance to socialist policies, Mao had to kill millions in his cultural revolution to enforce compliance to socialist policies, the killing fields of Cambodia was likewise a policy of purifying society by eliminating those who opposed Pol Pot's socialist paradise.

The bottom line is that socialist systems use violence to eliminate any counter revolutionary individuals or populations that may oppose them.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Those deaths were directly related to the implementation and enforcement of socialist policies. In other words, if Germany, Italy, Russia, Cuba, Cambodia had been ruled by democracies or representative governments then the vast majority of those deaths would have been averted.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I define socialism as a political/economic system characterized by a planned economy, non private control over the means (and distribution) of production , and a government/community centric society at the  expense of individual liberty.

That definition encompasses the Soviets, the Maoists, the Nazis, and the Fascists. Each form of socialism has its unique qualities but they all retain the same core elements.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you read Marx and Engels, you will see that socialism is a transitional phase of government that precedes Communism. 

In other words, socialism is a preliminary step that societies evolve through after they pass from agrarian systems, to industrial/capitalist systems, and ultimately into Communism. It is only during the final Communism stage that society evolves into a state were non private ownership of the means of production is complete. 

by definition having the cronies of government own and control all the means of production is fascism. 

Socialist systems merely have to have non private control over the means of production. Control does not require outright ownership of the means of production.  Socialism allows  keeping some industries in private hands during the transitional phase from capitalism to communism but those private hands are ultimately controlled by the government.

Again, Marx wrote that socialism  is a continuum. It is an evolutionary process that societies travel through from serfdom through capitalism and ultimately communism.

	<TEXT> Sorry but your collection of pictures are not Tea Party related. Only one picture has a tea party flag. None of the other pictures provide any proof that they are from Tea Party events or created by the Tea Party or its members. Many of the signs aren't even racist. If the Tea Party is as racist as you claim then there should be countless examples of Tea Party racism. Such examples simply do not exist.

For the record, the Tea Party stands for three things: Lower taxes, less government, less regulation. That's it. Racism has nothing what so ever to do with the Tea Party. As you will see, the Tea Party will continue to oppose any Progressive policies regardless of the race of the Democrat who proposes them.

As for the Nazis and the Fascists, both movements were forms of socialism.  Hitler and Mussolini were both ardent socialists. Both viewed their particular version of socialism as being superior to the various forms of socialism then offered. Hitler opposed Communism because he felt it was too slow, internationally focused and contained too many Jews.

You fail to consider in your analysis the facts that socialism does not require actual ownership of the means of production but can control the means of production via crony capitalism, regulation, and  favoritism. Both Nazis Germany and Fascist Italy exhibited all of the core elements of classical socialism such as a planned economy, control over the means (and distribution) of production, and a government centric community based society at the expense of individual liberty.  

People often wrongly confuse Naziism and Fascism as being right wing movements. That claim only makes sense if one's political spectrum is made up of only socialistic movements. 

Please read this article as it lays out the historical facts that the Nazis and the Fascists were indeed true and actual practicing socialists.
