	<TEXT> I can see the benefit of the one time use card but that doesn't make the app more sleek. I don't see the pin as a bad part because I'm fine with not having some weird physical button that also acts as a fingerprint scanner on my phone. As far as tapping the phone, that's the point, and the nfc chip is rather small so you need to know where the chip is in your phone. I've never tapped more than one for any nfc transaction I've made with my current or last phone which was the first phone to implement nfc and Google wallet  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Somewhere on reddit I saw a link to their simple no frills router that costs like $20 and plenty of people saying they use that as the router and then have an external wireless access point. My modem/router is already in a central location so that's not necessarily an option I need but I did notice they have wireless routers too. I'm just wondering how they compare to ASUS given any model you look at is half the cost of its Asus counterpart. Should I get tp-link or just go with ASUS? </TEXT>

She's not letting him talk for himself (is he capable of talking to other people?) and does a piss poor job of explaining what exactly he's doing. In another video he is very vocal (but there were no other people in contact with him) and described a lot of things so maybe he doesn't actually feel comfortable doing this with his mother around despite her facade of supporting his hobby?

I saw the Cleveland at a pawn shop for    $200. No damage except for scratches and scuffs, and the valves and slides are smooth as butter. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Anyone with an M8 experience "buzzing" when playing audio through an auxiliary jack in a vehicle? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-09-13 02:16:02 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I've had this problem to varying degrees and I don't know what exactly is causing it or how to deal with it. 

In my car I have a pioneer head unit with an auxiliary jack. He cable I've had in it for years has worked great for all my devices. 

In my truck I used to have a different cable that would produce noise with any device. Eventually the cable broke so I used one of my shortest ones temporarily. The short one produced no buzzing noise but it was too short. I got some long ones from monoprice and the plugs are too big for my case and even without my case they don't fit snug and the slightest movement makes them pop out a tiny bit and then audio stops. 

I moved the short cable that produced no noise to my work Truck that has an auxiliary jack. In my work Truck, I have to have the volume pretty loud to hear the audio from my phone. There is a buzzing but it's not too annoying. When I plug my phone into a charger, it gets louder but the buzzing gets worse and is constantly changing instead of just being a steady tone. 

Would a mobile headphone amp help this issue? Or would it only make the sound louder without cleaning it up? </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> It wouldn't be so bad if every single video didn't open as some sort of playlist. When I go to a user's page and open a specific video, I'm not wanting to open a playlist of their entire history of uploads and I am CERTAINLY am not wanting to have the next video play automatically. This is driving me insane and is forcing me to use my PS3 or Chromecast for youtube because at least I don't have to worry about this problem with that platform, but the problem there is having the list of videos start back up at the top after I scrolled down for a specific video. Also, I have almost all my subscriptions sorted into categories so I can find specific users easier, which is not supported on android.


Does anyone know a way to stop this nonsense? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have a 2012 Ram 1500 and when I got the truck years ago I stupidly didn't think that normal toppers wouldn't work with the Ram Boxes, I was too busy being impressed by the novelty of the ram boxes.

I want one because I'd like to go tent camping but I live in bear country so all my supplies and food need to be left in the truck. Bear-proof containers and coolers are expensive and don't offer much space since the walls need to be so thick, and a flat cover will just not do in this situation. </TEXT>

What would I do in either situation to remedy this? I'm going to be living here for the foreseeable future and not having water pressure in my hot shower after doing dirty work is unacceptable. I already feel as if I can never really get clean and a shitty shower will only amplify this.

	<TITLE> Thoughts on having a 3 week old sleep on his tummy? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-07-30 04:33:46 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Our newborn hates his cradle, but most of all he hates sleeping on his back. Since he was born we have not been able to get him to sleep more than an hour or two at once on his back unless he's extremely exhausted. This is leading him to be overly tired, preventing him from getting restful sleep when he does sleep. 

We found that he zonks right out when he is put on his tummy when he's tired though. He's sleeping right now and has been for 2.5 hours. I'm concerned though because up to this point everyone and everything has been saying to not lay a newborn on their tummy when they aren't being watched because sleeping face down can increase the risk of SIDS. I want him to be able to sleep but he doesn't sleep well on his back.

It should also be noted that he is 100% capable of lifting his head and turning it while he's laying face down and he can also scoot in circles when he's frustrated/hungry enough

	<TEXT> On July 3rd our first son was born and we've been having some trouble splitting the responsibility, primarily because I work a minimum of 12 hours per day and drive a truck, which is only compounded by the fact that I get sleepy while driving no matter how rested I am. I have terrible difficulty waking up at night when he needs a diaper change or to be fed and my poor wife isn't getting any sleep and is falling asleep in the middle of the day breastfeeding him. 

He seems to hate his cradle. After you've changed his diaper, fed him, and lulled him to sleep, as soon as he hits the cradle the fussing cycle starts all over. He could be dead asleep in your arms for 2 minutes or 2 hours but once the cradle gets involved all bets are off. 

When I get home from work I basically take care of the baby for the rest of the evening so she can go take a long deserved nap but it isn't enough sleep for her. Luckily, we've been living with my parents because of various life events and they're helping us get on our feet again so grandma and grandpa have been really helpful as far as holding him so the wife doesn't have to be along for more than half the day while I'm gone. 

I'm just at a loss at what more I can do :/ </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Months ago I posted in here asking for advice because my wife was experiencing extreme pains during the second trimester and was repeatedly dismissed by her OBGYN. It all came at am awkward time because we had already scheduled a new appointment for a different OBGYN because we were moving and the pains started right after cancelling an appointment with the old one. 

We finally got into the new OBGYN and they found she had some sort of infection and got her on antibiotics and fixed her right up. Leading up to the pregnancy she had a LOT of pre-labor type contractions and also retained a lot of water and he was growing at a faster rate than what was normal I suppose. 

Anyway the labor pains got real regular and intense last night and she thought her water broke so we came into the hospital. She was still only 2cm but after 6 hours of checking every 2 hours, sitting in the jacuzzi tub, walking around they finally felt a difference and decided the baby was going to come. 

Long story short, she got a spinal numb (I forget the actual term but it wasn't an epidural, the doctor couldn't get a spot for that one), they let her sleep for a half hour and then the doctor came back and it was crunch time. Literally 3 contractions and he was out and breathing fresh air and crying. Everything went well.  [Say hello to Finn Orion!] ( http://i.imgur.com/MuTt9xO.jpg) </TEXT>

Since there's the possibility of wires changing, I decided to use decora style wall plates with keystone/quickport inserts in addition to a decora style hidden cable insert that will put wires through PVC pipe to where a cable box/dvd player/etc will go. I'd use the much cheaper keystone Cat5/6 jacks from monoprice but lots of reviews are saying they are too wide to sit side by side on the decora inserts so I'm stuck with the more expensive Leviton brand ones </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm going to be helping my dad network his house while we have some walls torn up for a room remodel. The coaxial will run into the modem in the basement and then we'll connect that to a Wireless AC router mounted to the rafters of the basement in the centralmost spot of the house. After that I'd like to run to a large switch to send cables to each room of the house.

Wires to the top floor will need to be put through a wall into the attic.  There are three regular bedrooms on the top floor and I'd like to put two Cat5/6 to each of those rooms. The Master bedroom will have two coaxial, one on each end of the room, so in addition to that, I want two to each of those spots. I'd like 4-6 in the living room as well as 4-6 in two separate spots in another room which could become a home theater someday.

	<TEXT> I haven't dove into the world of NAS yet as it seems cumbersome to rebuild a RAID every time you add a hard drive and plug and play solutions like sinology are way out of my price range. 

I have a HTPC case about the size of an AV receiver so it looks nice sitting on the opposite end of the TV stand. I recently got some new hard drives for it to replace a 1tb and 500gb one so now I have three 3tb drives. 

basically I'm looking for advice on software raid and if it is reliable, like if one drive goes down, is my whole collection screwed? I'm getting real fed up with having to basically play Tetris with hard drive space with TV shows that are completed and shows that are continuing. I'd like to just have all 9tb as one volume so I can have one directory and stop worrying about running out of space on a single drive and having to keep transferring things. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> At first last week we thought that she was going into labor and miscarriage so we went to the hospital right away and they examined her and there was still a good amount of fluid and she wasn't dilated and they ran some tests and everything came up fine.

Fast forward a bit and her pains have been getting worse. She has had quite a bit of back pain as well as cramping pain and it's to the point where it's nearly crippling for her. She says it feels like her stomach is tightening and won't loosen up. We've tried calling the doctors and her OBGYN and it feels like nobody is taking us seriously. These guys are always like "call us if you have any questions or concerns" and yet we called yesterday and nobody answered so she left a message...no response. She called again today because it's worse and was finally able to get ahold of someone. The doctor apparently wasn't concerned at all and "too busy" to fit her in even though the place was empty when we stopped by the hospital today. All they had her do was a urine analysis to see if it was a urinary tract infection and then they would get back to her tomorrow (and we've already had a lot of experience with doctors at this hospital not calling us about test results). She doesn't feel that it's an infection though because she's had one and it didn't feel like how it does.

I'm at a loss at what to do because it feels like the people who are supposed to be helping us don't seem to give a shit

And in the case that for some godforsaken reason this amount of pain is normal (why would the body do this!?) What can we do to help deal with that pain? </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> In addition to the thing just looking like it needs some work in general, last season I started noticing that one side will get hotter than the other, so I may have to replace the burners? I got the thing for free a few years ago and it was pretty much in the same physical condition it is now but it just needed a new starter and a regulator. I never did put in a new starter out of laziness and just opted for lighting it with a match.

But spring is here and I need a project to kick off the season. All the wood needs replacing and since I'm doing that, I'd like to have fold-up shelves ([Like this](http://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/d/l225/m/mDbbdw-d9pe5fVqEG0rmoKg.jpg)) on each side to add some space since I'm in an apartment and don't have any type of table or space out there.

I'll also end up actually putting in that starter just because it wouldn't make sense to restore the grill and not put in the starter. I'd also like to add a temperature gauge, I know there are clip-on or temporary solutions out there but I'd like to have a permanent fixture.

I just came across an "unboxing" video posted on this subreddit and I figured I'd ask if anyone knows of any good unintentional ones because the intentional stuff like tapping on the box for 3 minutes straight just annoyed the hell out of me  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> What are good things to know about a 1997 6 cylinder Mustang? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-03-15 23:44:40 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I've owned my Mustang since I was in high school, and admittedly, I don't know a whole lot about cars, and I also don't place a lot of trust into mechanics I don't know, and the one guy I do know moved across the country. I only recently hit the 100,000 mark and I'd like to know what I can do to take care of my car myself. 

A few years ago I also had this weird problem where my car would just kinda lose power while on the interstate. It happened during hotter weather and it would start up again just fine after 20 minutes. No engine lights or anything. Definitely wasn't battery because I could still use the electronic stuff, the engine just wouldn't turn over unless I let it sit for a bit. I've heard a whole range of things it could be, from the fuel filter, to the fuel pump, it could be sensors, or even vapor lock. I'm just afraid to dump a whole bunch of money into doing all that and never truly knowing if it's fixed or not unless I decide to go on a 6 hour drive in hot weather, which I'm afraid to do now. </TEXT>

So far all I have on my list is desperadoes, apparently they have good hot wings. The double front is also on my list, love that fried chicken.

	<TITLE> Leaving the industry...for now at least </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-02-19 06:12:11 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> First, I just want to say that you guys are great. I specifically visit this sub far more than other subreddits other than whatever is on my front page. A lot of what I read here inspires me to better myself as a person and with food. Granted my experience so far is in a corporate kitchen and I'm not given any opportunity to really create something, I have still gained a lot of knowledge of the industry and of food itself, for which I am extremely grateful. I've been able to expand upon the ideas I see and do my own thing at home for family and friends. I'm able to whip up dishes for my friends who say they still have dreams about how good it tasted without looking up any form of a recipe, I'm just putting ingredients together that I feel work well. I love the food industry and that's why I'm saying I'm only leaving for now, because I'll be back, and hopefully next time I will be doing what I do for my friends, except on a bigger scale, and for people I don't know.

The short of it is that in July, my wife is due to have our first child. At her job, she only makes just above minimum wage, and even then, her ability to work will be hindered by having a baby, so I've been forced to look for a better-paying job that has more family-friendly hours. I got lucky and I generally only work mornings, but there are still really busy days where I'll put in 12 hours, and not ever knowing when I'll be home for dinner isn't an ideal situation right now. But for me, the best part is that since the job I've been offered pays me double what I make now, I'm guaranteed full time hours and bigger/more frequent raises. On top of that, I'm off work at 4pm every day, and I have weekends off. With the extra money I'm making, I'll be able to pay off my own student loans much faster, and I'll be able to save up money to begin my own small venture. So this definitely isn't goodbye forever, and I'm certainly not leaving this sub because you guys are my brothers.

Thanks for taking the time to read all of this if you did. I'm basically writing stream of consciousness. I don't actually have any personal friends in the industry and nobody on my side of the family or my wife's really understand why I love working in kitchens and working with food so they don't understand how someone like me can ever truly leave. Though I'm still young so I have many years ahead of me.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah yeah blah blah new years resolution blah blah. A couple weeks ago I started feeling like I'm too lazy and nothing would make me happier than to wake up at the asscrack of dawn and get some exercise in before I go to work. When I was in school I did the same thing before classes and it was great.

So what's the best gym in Bozeman? My wife is still going to school and I thought the $80 per semester fee since I'm married to her but that raises the problem of parking on campus and needing a parking pass too. Bus isn't an option because I typically work at 8-830am and the bus arrives at campus at 7 at the earliest. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Anyone else depend on your coworkers to be lazy and not do a 100% job in order to pick up their slack to get hours? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-12-31 10:11:17 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Lately at my job hours are hard to come by. They've dropped everyone to 4 days a week in prep and since business has normalized since our restaurant first opened just under a year ago, there's less to do in prep and as a result we come in later in the morning and leave earlier. 4 days a week is fine for me as long as I get 30 hours out of it but most days I only seem to have a maximum of 6 hours of my own work to do. Some weeks we're a bit busier and I end up with 30 hours and others it's like 25-26.

I have more than a few coworkers who bitch and moan about the hours but never do everything they're supposed to, and they also don't stay and help someone whose list is a bit longer. The last couple weeks I have resorted to being the only one who stays and helps and often that person will then ask if I just want to take over the end of shift stuff and they can go, which I gladly do because I hate working less than 7 hours in a day.

On too of that, nobody does the weekly cleaning stuff which I also end up doing by myself. I don't like doing all this but it's the only way I can make sure I have enough money to pay my bills. I've already resorted to picking up a second job in case they decide to drop us to 3 days per week. Unfortunately the second job doesn't pay as well so it's definitely not an exit plan if everything goes tits up.

I love this industry and I love the work I do but I don't like needing to scavenge for hours in order to support myself and my wife, especially with a kid due in 6 months. I feel like management isn't looking at my habits too kindly and think I'm milking the clock being there longer than anyone else all the time, even though I'm the one doing the work they want us to do.

Just needed to vent some place where people might understand. None of my friends have ever worked in the industry and I've never been the type to make friends out of coworkers (not that the chance has ever presented itself)

Thanks for all the hard work I know the rest of you guys are doing. This is my favorite subreddit to visit. It's like we're one big drunken family. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I work in a kitchen and we get a fair amount of to-go orders, especially large ones that require entire gallons of soup. When there is a large order the person in charge of the to-go stuff is supposed to tell the kitchen staff about it and we get everything ready. When there is a large order like that, it takes away from the soup that was meant for the dining area so we have to make sure there is enough warming up so we don't run out for the guests.

However, one person has made a habit of not telling anyone about the giant to-go orders and putting them in the computer last minute as if they didn't require any extra attention than regular orders, and on top of that, she justs takes the amount of soup she needs from the hot wells that are there for the servers to get soup for the dine-in guests. She has done this at least twice now, and every time I don't say anything about the soup, I just refill the hot-wells after she's done and I let her make more work for herself </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2013-12-02 10:48:31 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I first got "into" bitcoin about 2 years ago when bitcoin was about $5-10 each. I started mining with my gpu on slush's pool and got to 1 bitcoin and had it sent to my wallet. I then raised the threshold to 10 bitcoins, but I only got to 2.88 bitcoins before I lost my interest because at the time (and even now) I don't have a lot of money and couldn't afford to replace my gpu if it died an early life from being ran at 100% for so long, especially with bitcoins being as cheap as they were.

So here's where I made my 3 essential mistakes:

1: I didn't pay attention to what I was doing

2: I left bitcoins in the mining pool account

3: I didn't continue mining

I got a new larger SSD and backed up some stuff onto an external and wiped the old one for a fresh install of windows. I didn't realize that I didn't make sure to back up my wallet until months later, but by that time I didn't really care too much. I did backup my entire windows profile though (I'm sure you see where this is going). So I spent the last year and a half thinking that bitcoin was gone as I watched the price of bitcoin climb, climb, and climb some more, getting a little more upset at each hurdle, but still thinking "well at least I still have that 2.88 bitcoins"

So then I fast forward to about a week or so ago when bitcoin flew past 700+. I think "oh I should log into slush's pool" and what do I find when I log in? an empty balance. Somehow someone took my coins! Now that was really devastating, but I only have myself to blame for not making sure I transferred those funds to my own wallet.

But tonight I had a spark of dumb genius luck. I tried doing data recovery on my old SSD with low hopes since that computer has been in use for so long, the data has likely been overwritten. Obviously I found nothing. I give up and lie down in bed, but I can't sleep still. So I get up and plug my external in and start searching, and what else do I find but a bitcoin folder in my appdata folder, and what's this? it contains a bitcoin.dat! All this time I assumed that the bitcoin.dat was contained in the program files directory, not appdata! So first thing I do is backup my current wallet.dat, and put this one in its place and rescan with bitcoin-qt. After scanning, the program opens and my first 1BTC is sitting right before my eyes, back in my possession after all this time.

It's kindof a bittersweet ending, because yeah, I still am out 2.88BTC, and the full amount could have paid for half of the debt I'm in, and I'm sure if I waited out longer, I could have paid it all off in full which would have been great because all the money going towards bills could be put back into investing in bitcoin. But not all is lost, and I'm definitely being more careful from here on out. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Bosses wanted someone to do some extra prep work tomorrow to make sure we have most of our main sauces and soup made so we have enough to start the day with on Friday. We're closed on Thanksgiving so no prep work will be done that day so if I don't, whoever is in charge of sauces will have a real rough day. So instead of working a few hours at my second job and in general having a relaxing day before I spend a whole day in my own kitchen, I will now be bumbling into work at 5:30am, get off at 10:30, run to my other job, work there, and then be worn out and probably not get as much of my own prep work done that I wanted to on Wednesday.
