	<TEXT> It's amazing what difference a good actor vs. a bad actor can make.  I immediately felt connected to this coffeemate guy.  The lines didn't feel forced and his deliver was perfect.  Bryan Cranston is an amazing actor because he can be anyone, not just Walter White. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Having to wait until 21 to drink legally is insane.  You guys in the states need to come visit us in Canada more often... or visit just about anywhere else in the world and get a drink before you're 21. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> One of the first cars I ever drove was a 1973 Datsun 240z. I drove it from 2001-2004 since my dad thought it would be a good car to cut my teeth on, especially since you can open the hood and actually learn about how the thing works. Today's cars are basically computers under the hood.

I remember it felt like you were literally sitting on the ground it was so low.  It also used to get insanely hot in the cab because all of the heat from the engine had to go somewhere. </TEXT>
