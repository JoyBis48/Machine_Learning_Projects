	<TEXT> You have a responsibility to your students to keep the environment of your class safe and conductive to learning. Having someone who is not participating can be distracting and throw off the energy of the practice. I think you did the right thing, have you checked with other co workers to see if it has been an issue in anyone else's class? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would start by considering what you are looking for in a teacher and a practice, is there a style you prefer? Or are you searching more for a teacher you vibe with?
I don't care for the brand lulu lemon, but the people who work in the stores tend to be pretty in sync with the yoga community. That may be a place to get started. 
Best of luck to you! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Teaching is the hardest, most time consuming, and difficult thing I have ever done, but I wouldn't do anything else. My mentor said something great to me , I can teach you how to make a lesson better I can teach you to manage a class, but I can't teach you to love kids. I think thats what makes a good teacher, it is how much do you care about your students . I love my kids so I push myself to make better lessons , I make sure I do everything I can to help them succeed, and I make sure they know how much I care. I have seen teachers who go into teaching because they love their content area , and those teachers burn out quickly , because no matter how much you love math if you don't like kids it won't be worth it in the end. Hope that helps some best of luck. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Vegan giving up added sugar </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I would like to give up foods with added sugar in my diet for the next 30 days. I was wondering if anyone would like to join me, or if anyone has advice on getting rid of added sugar?
Edit People have been asking why I want to do this, it is partially because of a family history of type 2 diabetics, but also because of the other health issues that seem to be related to added sugar. I AM NOT TRYING TO LOSE WEIGHT, just trying to feel better and hopefully reduce my risk for disease. Also thanks for all the support r/vegan  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you meet someone who is great date them, if you are happy being single and no one strikes your fancy then be single. I will say that dating in college is like an experiment and it is likely that at no other point in your life you will have as many variables. i.e. there are many different types of people to date in college and this can help you figure out what you are looking for. I had one of my worst boyfriends while I was in college followed by one of the best. College is about figuring out who you are and what you want out of life if you want to do that by your self great if you meet someone to share in your adventure of self discovery then thats great too. Hope that was helpful. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I loved psyc, but I got out of college and I was bar tending to make ends meet, I had planned to go to grad school and become a counselor but I wanted to take some time off. Part of being a bartender is talking to people listening to problems I was good at it but I was exhausted by it (I am sure that the 12 hour shifts didn't help) and you can't really offer any real solutions, you can just listen .I figured I needed get a better feel for if I wanted to be a counselor, I started working for a crisis hotline that too left me feeling burnt out. I went a head and applied to grad school , a few psyc programs and a couple education programs . I got into a few schools and I decided to go with education , I had a real tough time when I was in middle and high school , and it would have been much worse if it wasn't for a few out standing teachers. I felt this was a way for me to help people , that was sustainable for me. I love my job , it is very challenging, and time consuming, but I wouldn't trade it for the world.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Abnormal psychology, I got a psyc degree before I became a teacher and spent a lot of time studying abnormal psyc. I found it fascinating and terrifying at the same time. I have a deep seeded fear I'll get dissociative fugue at some point in my life. I also secretly diagnose everyone with very mild forms of psychological disorders in my head just to keep myself from forgetting the symptoms. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I find the most effective argument to go vegan is, to show people that you are happy and healthy. People always ask why I choose to eat this way and I tell them because of the environment and animal cruelty, I typically leave it at that, but I may say if they are interested to check out book x or documentary z. Its not preachy it encourages them to seek out their own answers. It also doesn't hurt that I am lean, unfortunately a lot of women are only interested in veganism because they think they will lose weight (case and point skinny bitch)
Oh and Peta has lost all credibility in most people's minds so it doesn't matter how loud they scream no one wants to listen. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm guessing that if she is 23 then she just finished her first year of teaching,   so here are a few things I would have loved after my first year teaching(some of these are more romantic than others) 
A trip to a museum, or historical site ( teach history, but this could be adapted to any subject or any interest)
Replace some sort of technology that she uses daily ( printer, laptop, Ipad, etc)
Or just plan an evening with her , take her to dinner, go dancing, check out a band, sometimes as a teacher it is just really nice to have someone else plan things to do. 
Hope this was helpful, you sound like a thoughtful boyfriend </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ear plugs and an eye mask, in college everyone has such different schedules these things can save you if you have an exam the next day and your neighbors/ roommates are being loud...or if you are hungover and need to sleep it off while the rest of the world buzzes about. Speaking of hangovers keep gatorade or coconut water on hand drink half of it before you go to bed after a night of drinking and the other half in the morning, it helps take the edge off. Bonus if you can get the extra electrolyte packets that gatorade makes , check with your friends who are in the athletic trainer program.
