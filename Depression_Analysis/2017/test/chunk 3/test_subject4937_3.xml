	<TEXT> Hi there! Yes, I think I have found two different answers through /rockhounds. There is an ongoing fight (via someone else's similar specimen) that it is either barite or selenite. It is indeed very heavy for its size--translucent (slightly smoky) spires vertically oriented but with a few horizontal "bars" of yellowish running throughout. No blacklight here, sorry. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If the server market numbers from IDC and others is any indication--people DO want these. The question is, would they want them from IBM when, as mentioned in the article, HP, Supermicro, Dell and others are going to stick it on the price (not to mention the flexibility--i.e. for now it's just Xeon E5) -- It's hard to see IBM competing in the "made in China" wars but this does seem to be where the server market itself is going--Open Compute-inspired, stripped down systems that are purpose-driven and free from the cumbersome crap (like Platform's workload mgr, etc--things included here)...

All server makers on the HPC side are confused. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have something similar--it is shale and has lines in it from fossilized mud/ripples. It seems to break in odd places so sometimes it looks like something more interesting than it is. I have broken a few of mine, sanded others down, but only one appears to be really interesting/have something unique (in this case a foot/print). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, hello neighbor--I am in High Point. Found these in one giant patch of similar thick rocks with ripples and brought many of them home. They were in a MOST geologically strange location--crystals unlike I've seen a couple of (seriously) amethyst points. Never seen anything like it. 

These are not stromatolites for sure. Got a bunch of those already--these things are thick, like layers and layers of ancient mud. I will take a few photos in a little bit to give you a sense of what some of the others are with my tiny, tiny hands as scale (ha--seriously).

Love the Pteridinium but this thing would have to be many yards long and there's not enough regularity.

Pics coming in 10 minutes or so of some of my other hunks. Again--weird locale. Amethyst points (2), an emerald, and what appears to be citrine. Not sure what to think. 

Okay--off to photograph for you! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks so much for taking the time and thought to send the link and ideas. I have a number of other pieces of this "fossilized mud" stuff that look somewhat similar to the pieces there, but they are VERY thick. Some of the pieces are 6-8 inches thick, others thicker. It looks like this (which I found after a long search for anything similar) http://getoffourplanet.com/?p=3603

The weird thing is, the "bones" in this are black and much harder than the surrounding rock. It is possible for me to clean around it and those remain. Afraid to do so until I know more.

To answer your question, there is no curvature to any of the chunks I have--the link above is almost exactly what this stuff looks like. Oddly enough, there isn't anything clearly visible that's fossilized in anything other than the deep ripples (which incidentally, when a big one broke, the ripples go all the way through--completely 3D).

I am so glad you sent that info. It helps me keep an eye for other exciting things in the vicinity!

	<TEXT> I found a number of pieces of fossilized, dark mud in a riverbed in central north carolina. Surrounded by some of the most perfectly formed quartz points I've seen around here, to boot. Strange place... Most of the fossilized mud pieces are straight or slightly wavy lines. Light sanding tones them down. But under these "toes" or whatever they are it's black hard rock, different than what makes these up. Can anyone help me ID? I am new to this... </TEXT>
