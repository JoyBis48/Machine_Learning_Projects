	<TEXT> ##**Science Verified User Program**

/r/science has a a system of verifying accounts for commenting, enabling trained scientists, doctors and engineers to make credible comments in /r/science . The intent of this program is to enable the general public to distinguish between an educated opinion and a random comment without a background related to the topic. 


#**What flair is available?**

All of the standard science disciplines would be represented, matching those in the sidebar.
However, to better inform the public, the level of education is displayed in the flair too. For example, a Professor of biology is tagged as such (Professor- Biology), while a graduate student of biology is tagged as "Grad Student-Biology." Nurses would be tagged differently than doctors, etc...

The general format is:

Level of education|Field|Speciality or Subfield (optional)

When applying for a flair, please inform us on what you want it to say.

#**How does one obtain flair?**


First, have a college degree or higher in a field that has flair available.
Then send proof to the mods of /r/science .

This can be provided several ways:

1) [Message the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fscience) with information that establishes your claim, this can be a photo of your diploma or course registration, a business card, a verifiable email address, or some other identification. All submissions will be kept in confidence and not released to the public under any circumstances. You can submit an imgur link and then delete it after verification. 

Remember, that within the proof, you must tie your account name to the information in the picture.


2) if you aren't comfortable messaging the mods with identifying information, you can directly message any individual mod and supply the information to them. Again, your information will be held in confidence.


3) Send an email with your information to sciencereddit@gmail.com after messaging the mods to inform them of this option. Your email will then be deleted after verification, leaving no record. 

This is convenient if you want to take a photo of your identification and email from a smart phone, for example.


Thanks for making /r/science a better place!

	<TITLE> Science AMA Series: Ask Your Questions About Ebola. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-10-01 03:03:49 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Ebola has been in the news a lot lately, but the recent news of a case of it in Dallas has alarmed many people.  

The short version is:  Everything will be fine, healthcare systems in the USA are more than capable of dealing with Ebola, there is no threat to the public.

That being said, after discussions with the verified users of /r/science, we would like to open up to questions about Ebola and infectious diseases.

**Please consider donations to [Doctors Without Borders](http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/our-work/medical-issues/ebola?utm_source=google utm_medium=ppc utm_term=brand_sitelink) to help fight Ebola, it is a serious humanitarian crisis that is drastically underfunded.** (Yes, I donated.)

Here is the ebola fact sheet from the World Health Organization: http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs103/en/

Post your questions for knowledgeable medical doctors and biologists to answer.

**[If you have expertise in the area, please verify your credentials with the mods and get appropriate flair before answering questions.](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/wiki/flair)**

Also, you may read the [Science AMA from Dr. Stephen Morse on the Epidemiology of Ebola](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/2cbthq/science_ama_series_im_stephen_morse_a_professor/)  

as well as the numerous questions submitted to /r/AskScience on the subject:

[Epidemiologists of Reddit, with the spread of the ebola virus past quarantine borders in Africa, how worried should we be about a potential pandemic?](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/2c4x07/epidemiologists_of_reddit_with_the_spread_of_the/)

[Why are (nearly) all ebola outbreaks in African countries?](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/220ac8/why_are_nearly_all_ebola_outbreaks_in_african/)

[Why is Ebola not as contagious as, say, influenza if it is present in saliva, therefore coughs and sneezes ?](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/2d3p7d/why_is_ebola_not_as_contagious_as_say_influenza/)

[Why is Ebola so lethal? Does it have the potential to wipe out a significant population of the planet?](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/2bs08v/why_is_ebola_so_lethal_does_it_have_the_potential/)

[How long can Ebola live outside of a host?](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/2cbvtl/how_long_can_ebola_live_outside_of_a_host/)

Also, from /r/IAmA: [I work for Doctors Without Borders - ask me anything about Ebola.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2g79ip/i_work_for_doctors_without_borders_ask_me/)

[CDC and health departments are asserting "Ebola patients are infectious when symptomatic, not before"-- what data, evidence, science from virology, epidemiology or clinical or animal studies supports this assertion? How do we know this to be true?](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/2i51u1/cdc_and_health_departments_are_asserting_ebola/)

	<TEXT> Hi, I'm Marcel Salathe, assistant professor on leave to work on startup. Short CV: Graduated at ETH Zurich, Switzerland, moved to US for postdoc at Stanford, took tenure-track faculty position at Penn State a few years ago, became very active in nascent field of digital epidemiology, created a popular MOOC on infectious diseases (on coursera), came back to the Bay Area earlier this year because I was accepted into Y Combinator, now working on a new project, Teeays.
Happy to talk about all these things, particularly with respect to online education, academic life vs startup life, but happy to answer other questions too.

Post your questions here:

	<TEXT> We're looking for a practical way to judge Panelist activity in /r/AskScience, and a good way would be to generate a log like the moderation log but tracking flaired users.  We don't care so much what they've posted, but rather how much Panelists post, so a simple tabulation of the poster and the number of comments would be fine.

Seems like it would be straight forward, but I've learned that simple things sometimes aren't so simple, so it makes sense to ask more experienced people first! </TEXT>
