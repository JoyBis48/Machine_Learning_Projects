	<TEXT> I have not tried this, nor do i have any experience with edibles, but I came up with this idea while I was really high. So what you would do is bake chocolate sauce with a bunch of kief and dip strawberries and bananas in the resulting sauce. Don't know if this would work... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Being high opens your mind to new possibilities and helps you realize that everyone is just like you and that we should all respect one another. I speak from experience when i say that I am more mature and my mind is more open after i started smoking on occasion. You will also feel very happy and appreciate everything around you, like nature, much more as you realize life is the result of a complex set of interacting systems. Toke on, friend. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not sure I fully understand. Can't you just declare the method as final in Java to prevent subclasses from overriding it? Or is the OOP concept of overriding itself at fault here? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Found 60 bucks on the ground at a [5] </TITLE>

	<TEXT> So last night I smoked and then went to eat at a cafeteria. I had grabbed some delicious brownies and was walking back to the table my friend was at who was at a [6] but he handles his shit like a fucking boss. Looked down on the ground and I found what I thought to be 40 bucks. I rush over and pick it up, suddenly aware people probably think I'm baked as fuck.  
Anyway when I get back to my table and show my friend I take it out of my pocket and it was actually 60 bucks! At this point I could not handle my shit at all; I had just found the largest amount of cash ever in my life on the ground. I was leaning forward on the table giggling uncontrollably, getting paranoid that someone might have seen me pick it up. But no one did, and me and my buddy left the cafeteria 60 bucks richer. I plan on using it to buy an eighth. Good times.  
TL;DR found 60 bucks on the ground, using it to buy an eighth :D  
edit: also I really enjoyed the brownie. </TEXT>
