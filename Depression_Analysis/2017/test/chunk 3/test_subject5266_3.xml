EDIT 2: Thankyou so much for all the feedback so far, I have revised the artstyle and altered the character design as people have suggested and this is where I am going:

ORIGINAL POST:

Any feedback on the artstyle or idea is appreciated, just be aware that any feedback may be taken into account in the project, which means anything you post here could be used/appropriated - so if you have any ideas you think are too brilliant to give away for free please keep em to yourself and make your own game because I'd love to play it :)

Basically the game plays like a chose your own adventure/screen based game (maybe like visual novels? I dunno never played one), you have conversations with characters and decide where the plot goes by what the character does and what tale she ends up experiencing :)

I'm planning on having vastly different story threads depending on every choice you make, you could befriend someone or kill them :o - characters could betray you or you may never know their true motivations by the end. 

Because there are going to be a lot of panels, I've chosen a simple artstyle. I may also include a QTE decision system for high pressure moments, but it won't be anything complex, because I don't like complex QTEs.

Would you play this kind of game? 

Edit: wow! thanks for the comments, feedback and upvotes ^_^

	<TEXT> "War... War has changed..." vs. "War... War never changes..." It's almost like Kojima wrote that line to challenge the inherent view of our culture's tendency to fetishize violence and revere warriors as mythic things instead of seeing them as people who are mistreated by those in power. 

Nice observation! I like it. Good point. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I love how Kojima can use a wildly contrasting tone (camp 60's in this case) and still deliver a really serious and compelling criticism of war.

I love how MGS3 basically shows how soldiers are used and abused by governments for their own ends. There is no king and country bullshit here.

MGS is basically pop culture porn, but it is NOT war porn, something I appreciate greatly in the franchise and in a climate where MANY video games and even similar genres are playing up war as "cool" in a direct and shameless fashion - it's nice to see MGS actually having something to say about the shitty state of affairs our world has become. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Traditional script writing software has been fine for my linear stories but how do I legibly construct a non linear narrative with different endings? A story tree writing solution would be immensely helpful so any suggestions? Preferably free options :) </TEXT>
