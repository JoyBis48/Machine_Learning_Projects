	<TEXT> You're claiming it's a myth, I'm arguing there is actual fact.  Grades might not be distinguished the same as beef (prime, choice, etc) but fresh fish that I was eating daily in Japan+NYC was "sashimi grade" compared to the places you've worked i.e (farm rasied)  Dunno where you live, but in NYC where I work and live, sashimi is flown in from Japan+Australia daily.  

I agree places like Whole Foods will get away with their "sashimi" but scientific fact, when the brain of the fish is pierced and lactic acid is minimal, you're getting the best of the best.  I know that's what I'm getting.   </TEXT>

The time frame last about 3 1/2 hours from beginning to end.  After getting printed, processed, and what seemed like an eternity, we were let go.  My court date was 2 months later.  That lasted 15 min tops, judge gave me a A.C.D (Adjournment for Court Dismissal). End of story.

	<TEXT> I was fortunate to go to private school bc my parents (japanese) believed in good education.  About 90% of my classmates were white, (wealthy white) while the other 10% were asian+black.  I was able to attend bc of finanical aid.  At a early age I saw firsthand just how different a mindset these kids had vs the minorities.  It was self entitlement and this general attitude of being spoiled and saying/doing outrageous shit thinking it's completely acceptable. 


The one thing I still get annoyed with is when I deal with entitled rich white punks who think they run the shit.  It's a certain arrogance and mindset that exists.  Now that I'm living in NYC I see it 24-7 especially around midtown.  My friends and I like to call them Chad's + Brad's and or Wall St Douchebags.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Good question.  When I have people over, I use a burner stove so that I can cook on the table, but you can also do it over stove top.  Not a rolling boil, but a good simmer.  The key is getting the beef cut super thin (paper thin 1/16").   You basically want to dip the meat and swirl in the water for a few seconds max.  Veggies will take longer.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I used to work for a home health care agency, part of the job was to deliver meds to people with chronic illness.  One client was a 17 year old with severe arthritis which prompted him to be dependent on pain killers.  Month by month I noticed his orders of opiates began to increase not only in quantity but strength.  He began to lose weight fast, and his skin color was pale from being indoors.  It got so bad  there would be times I would go over to his house and while we were talking he would doze off in mid sentence.

One day during my delivery, I pulled him aside and told him my concern.  Of course this could have totally gotten me fired bc it really wasn't any of my business, but I felt the need to say something.  It was a short stern talk, and really didn't expect much from it.  

A year later, and I moved to NY and I get a friend request from him on Facebook.  My eyes began to water as I looked thru his pictures.  Not only did he move out of his home, he got a job working IT, became super fit and tanned.  He thanked me the talk because no one else (not even mom) gave a shit.   </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Apartment was broken into last nite, East Williamsburg.  Cops came to take a report, no follow up whatsoever.  Is this a common theme amongst burglaries?   </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Backstory:  Last nite I left the front window open in my living room, woke up in the morning to find the screen window busted open and 2 of my wife's lap tops missing.  The laptops were sitting on the couch.  It was a pretty brave move on the burglars part, only because he would have had to actually open a gate, peak in from a ledge, and then break the screen.  Either way, it was a shitty feeling, and we should have known better.  


So we decide to call the cops, 4 huge dudes (more like gorillas) came in did some paper work, told us a detective would come by to do some prints.  They told us not to touch a thing because its all evidence, blah blah, and handed us a "incident information slip".  They gave us a # to call to report this matter in order to receive a complaint report #.  We've tried calling this number all day yesterday and today, no answer.   


I'm in no way expecting to find my laptop, I know its a lost cause.  But is this really the case where cops come in, give you a slip of paper and act like they're working only to have you run in circles?  Why couldn't they issue a Report # on the spot so a file could be started?  Anyone else have similar incidents?    </TEXT>
