	<TEXT> This would be a stupid move on Wilmots case in my opinion. I think Wilmot mismanaged this Belgian squad in Brazil. Though Belgium got as far as some expected after the draw was revealed. I can't help think that he didn't do enough to get Hazard motivated or involve him enough. Hazard at the beginning was tipped to be one of the stars of the WC, but turned out to be a shadow of his usual self. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This quote seems kind of odd. I feel like he didn't need to apologize because he wasn't owned by us. If anyone should be close to apologizing, it's Courtois, but even so, I don't want him apologizing either.  Costa didn't have a %100 guarantee of being sold to Chelsea so he shouldn't be sorry for putting on a good *audition*, he should probably apologize to terry for irritating him haha. </TEXT>

Also with the lessening popularity of our involvement in the Middle East, with the video playing a very key role in my experience with the song. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Good album since nothing for the past like past 3 or 4 years. Sage is a lyrical creative monster as usual, shows a lot of emotion with isolation and heartbreak and such. My favorite tracks are Grace, Make em Purr, ID Thieves, and Vonnegut Busy. But essentially, if you dig Sage, you're gonna dig this album.

Ahh thanks for the clarification, I just always group Sage with those guys. </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2014-07-31 00:15:40 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Have you ever listened to a song and it seems to really gel with you, except there are lyrics that just don't click? This is how I feel sometimes, and it can be off-putting. However, these songs I'm about to mention, I still listen to and love.

The two that come to mind off the top of my head are "Champagne Supernova" by Oasis and "Human" by The Killers


I know Champagne Supernova is the most famous one, but can't go without being said.


* Champagne Supernova "Slowly walking through the hall, faster than a cannonball..."

EGAD! Does not compute  [The moment](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3C7DECI0jU t=0m43s)


* Human "Are we Human? Or are we Dancer? My sign is vital. My hands are cold"

I don't get it, does anyone? [We are Dancer, I guess](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIZdjT1472Y t=0m43s)


This isn't a thread about the worst lyrics, I'd like it to be the lyrics you'd like to change to otherwise good songs.


Conspiracy theory: Both songs occur at the 43 second mark... dun dun dun

Thanks! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah Pete Townsend took them to a whole new level. As for another contributor, I think Neil Peart, the drummer from Rush is up there. He is a really smart dude that also writes the lyrics, lots of good lyricism in Rush songs. Not to mention, he's one of the best drummers out there.

I think it's also fair to mention John Frusciante of the Red Hot Chili Peppers. Once he joined RHCP, he changed the game for them. Him and Jimi Hendrix are two guitarists that I really think are 'one' with their guitar/sound. So good to listen to. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It seems like encores have become a pleasantry to the bands from the fans. If the fans don't call for an encore then they might be seen as rude or ungrateful. It's the same thing as saying "bless you" when someone sneezes. It serves no purpose, but if you don't say bless you, then you look like a dick. Unless someone sneezed before, then I might cheer for a sneeze encore, depending on the quality of the sneeze. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Words I Never Said by Lupe Fiasco from Laser. Sky Full Of Stars by Coldplay from Ghost Stories. These are pretty mainstream, but what resonated with me the most. These songs in my opinion are a shining light in a lackluster album. Personally, I don't hate Lasers like most hip-hop fans did but I thought Lupe killed that track even if the beat was a bit industrial-esque. As for Ghost Stories, the best track is an Avicii song with Chris Martin as the featured singer. Everything else about the album is mehhhh. Gwenyth Paltrow sucks. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I like the idea of riot developing the community's idea, but they should also give credit where credits due. Maybe just a footnote on the bottom of the page that says "Originally designed by:_____". Doesn't have to be anything too flamboyant, and maybe give that user the champ for free and some RP, seems like good enough compensation for their contribution. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not saying their not talented because they can sing really really good. I just don't think they should be idolized based on the lyrics they sing. And people quoting their lyrics as mantras for their daily lives seems like a sham. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> How do you guys feel about artists/bands that don't write their own material? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Personally, I really don't like the idea of a band not writing their own material. It's okay in my opinion for some of their material, but people that gain fame without writing their own material isn't really that impressive to me. When someone releases a song under their name, they are effectively advocating whatever they're saying, unless its satire. So it seems like when people admire an artist/band, they're worshiping a facade. How do you guys feel about this? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is actually pretty off base. First off Motrhead and will.i.am aren't representatives of their genre. And there's also a clear difference in time frame and it's correlation with popularity. Motrhead isn't as likely to get recognized on the scale Will is. His popularity is a lot larger so he's getting haggled everywhere he goes. Motrhead is in the twilight of their career and loves the intimacy they can have with their fans at this time in their careers. Also, if you're in Hong Kong having visa issues, how badly would you care about having your photo taken with a stranger. Must've been frustrating, as is. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is just speculation and I don't have any hard evidence to back it up. But I did see that record sales are down since last year, and I don't know if it's a trend or not. However, with iTunes and such, it's a lot easier to cherry pick the songs you like and not need to buy the others. Could it be easier for the less active fans to quickly sift through a bands *newest* and *best* tunes without having to listen through them all. Basically, is a band better off hyping 3-4 singles for a bunch of sales than an entire album? </TEXT>
