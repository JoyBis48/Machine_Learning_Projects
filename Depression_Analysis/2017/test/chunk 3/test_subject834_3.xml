	<TEXT> Why do people say it gets better? How can life get better when your future is ruined by an illness inside of your brain? I actually have 2-3 of those illnesses inside my brain. My future is gone, why should I continue and just suffer all the way through it, why can't I be mercy killed, peacefully? I know I may not be terminally ill, but I am chronically ill that makes me wish I was terminally ill just so my suffering would end. How can it get better, when it's already destroyed?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Anti-Psychotics slow down or stop your metabolism all together. I don't get appetite increase that much, maybe I eat a 100 or so more calories than a normal person. 

There is also no way that someone that used to NEVER put on weight put on 80-90 pounds in 11-12 months. It's not possible without eating at McDonalds everyday, every night and every midnight. 

When you say "meds don't cause weight gain"... Steroids do and so do Anti Psychotics...

	<TEXT> Even though I've got somewhat "clinically" better, I now don't see the point in continuing this life. I've lost most of my education (I was a very smart/good student), I've gained about 85-90 pounds in a fucking year from this medication and I don't even eat a lot, I eat normally. I could've went back to my school yesterday, but because I'm so overweight I can't bear the reactions I would get, I don't feel good at all. I have chronic pain as well, and it's undiagnosed because no one cares to help me. 

What can I really do in society? I'm nothing, I can't even function when I'm "better".   </TEXT>

You're just paranoid, people with bipolar can get paranoid too you know.

	<TEXT> In my view, I think that if you legalize heroin for 21+ at about 2.5g per 2-3 days then that would actually help more people than it hurts. Getting heroin off the street is what makes heroin dangerous. Pharma grade diamorphine (heroin) is no worse than oxycodone, morphine etc... Hydromorphone is actually stronger I believe. 

Over here in the UK we already use diamorphine medically, and not just for terminally ill patients either. 

Edit: Nothing ever happens over night, and nothing ever happens if we just sit on our asses and do nothing because we think it's impossible.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I know that my life may not be completely ruined but I just can't help that I could've done so much more if it weren't for me being "ill". I've even said to my self, "what's the point in going back if I'm a year and a bit behind everyone". Nothing feels like a huge accomplishment, it feels more like a completely failure in my life, and that I've dug a hole that I can't get out of because of something that I couldn't have controlled, or maybe I could've controlled it... I don't know any more. 

I have positive times where I say to myself, "maybe school just isn't/wasn't for me right now and that I've learned a lot of stuff myself and maybe that'll come in handy", but no one else seems to agree... I know that I have to go back to school, that's not what I am even saying to people, I'm just saying that I've learned a lot of somewhat useful things while I wasn't at school, but people always seem to disagree when I bring that up thinking that I mean that I won't go back to school, and it shoots my confidence all the way back down again. 

Thank you for making me feel better and actually listening to what I have to say, unlike others in my life right now. </TEXT>

How would you like it if you were addicted to heroin, and no one gave you a clean rig, and you contracted a life threatening disease, like Hep C and HIV?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't really know where to start, but I'll try anyway. I was diagnosed with Psychosis NOS about a year and a few months ago, then it progressed into a diagnosis of basically schizophrenia, to put it bluntly. With schizophrenia we have 2 blocks of symptoms, negative and positive. Negative is basically, lack of emotion, extreme lack of motivation, poor hygiene, disorganization (which Is pretty strong for me, stronger than the other negative symptoms) etc. Positive symptoms are just basically psychosis. Anyway, because of this, I had do drop out of school, as directed by my doctors. I lost most of my friends, except one and he has always been my best friend, but he's just came back into the picture (which is great btw, when you've been in extreme isolation for a year that shit will touch your heart more than anything). Being in extreme isolation and barely getting sunlight other than the sun rays coming through my window, is extremely depressing especially when you're not in an episode and have to reflect on how this has affecting your life... 

I've just started getting tutoring back in my school, once a week... I don't see the point in going back to school any more, I'm already behind everyone, people think I'm stupid because I don't go to school (even though I've learned a lot of stuff on my own in the past year). Schizophrenia (with depression, but depression hasn't been diagnosed, it's probably depression because of the schizophrenia). I feel absolutely hopeless, it's like I can't get something inside my head out... I just want to be normal again, but there's always something inside my mind stopping me. I used to think I would have a good career, have a good life etc... That's all completely ruined now.

I'll answer any question to clarify anything... Thank you. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I just got prescribed Seroquel XL 200mg. I used to take 100mg x2 but because it's easier to take 1 pill rather than 2 a day she moved me onto the prolonged release. I am not sleeping when I take it at night, it doesn't even make me tired like the IR versions did, not even one bit... Actually, the first time I took it (which was last night) I was up all night until 9am. I don't understand because Seroquel used to make me pretty tired when I took my night time dose, but the XL doesn't at all... Why is this? I of course take it for Schizophrenia but it was nice to sleep when I took it because I do usually have insomnia as well.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> An opiate that doesn't kill you through respiratory depression, meaning you can go as high as you want without dying of respiratory failure. It doesn't cause nausea at any dose whatsoever, and at very, very large doses, is psychedelic and at very, very low doses feels a lot like Amphetamine without the comedown. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Poppy Seed Tea. THAT IS ALL... But in all seriousness, OP, morphine is my favourite opiate, but I usually get 'Morphine Oral Solution' which has always worked for me. It is definitely more of a body high, but I always feel great on morphine, whether I get the oral solution or I bang that shit.
