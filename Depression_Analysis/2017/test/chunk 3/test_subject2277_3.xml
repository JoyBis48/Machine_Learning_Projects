	<TEXT> In Canada,( where I live) the courts have ruled there is no expectation of privacy in our yards.

Else your neighbor would get arrested for looking into your backyard.

I don't believe cops jerking off in helicopters is a reasonable concern.

To answer your question, you have zero expectation of privacy on city streets. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Probably because she kicked him and then he threw her to the ground, which is self defense.

Was it excessive force?  Possibly.  I believe he could have accomplished a similar end result ( her being on the ground) with less force and her face not hitting the ground.

Assault?  I say no, cause she kicked him and he defended himself. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I admit that I'm left a bit taken aback at how positively dreadful some people are online and how they always seem to find each other, so that they can tear people down collectively.

I've been online since 94 and the viciousness has been gradual.

	<TEXT> You seem to spend a lot of time on /r/drugs.

I'm a recovering alcoholic and when I was drinking, my main focus was on getting loaded.

Once I got myself clean and sober, I was able to focus my energies on the actual things in my life that mattered and clearly see the big picture.

I also saved a lot of money getting clean, quit smoking too, which also saved me some money.

I wish you well.
