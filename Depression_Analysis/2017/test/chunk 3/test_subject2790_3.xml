	<TEXT> I know, that's why I wasn't sure whether or not to message them again. I don't want them to feel pressurised, it's the delivery service who would be at fault. It's my first time receiving a gift from out of the country and I wasn't 100% sure what the average delivery times were either.

Thanks for advising me about the username issue, I didn't know if I could change it. It sounds sad but I didn't want to lose my trophy haha. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Went to go see The Voices with a few friends. We all work in a pub, some bar, some kitchen. There's a scene where Ryan Reynolds puts Gemma Arterton's head in a fridge. I turned to my kitchen trained friend and said "What's he doing? Raw meat goes on the bottom shelf!" 

She broke down in laughter and I heard snickering from behind us. </TEXT>
