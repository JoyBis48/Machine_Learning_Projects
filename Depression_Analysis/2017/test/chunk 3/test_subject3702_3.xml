I drink, but I've also seen how alcohol ruins lives. 

Cigarettes will give you a heart attack at 55 maybe, or put a hole in your throat, or fill your lungs up with delicious tar etc etc... But booze can turn a person into a shade of what they were.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was a little shy in high school, but I had a couple of girlfriends and wasn't afraid to socialize, fell into a few cliques etc... I'm not sure if many high schools are like this in the country, but I grew up in an extremely controlled environment. We were not allowed to leave the building for any reason whatsoever with out a proper escort (usually the hall monitor, or school police officer), and were to be under constant supervision between school operating times. For after school activities, an adult was to be present at all times.

Now, I know that these precautions were taken for legality issues, but my point is that we were treated like children in an unhealthy way. I also know that under the eyes of the law most of us were still legally children. But the negative aspect of this type of coddling led to discouraging a lot of the kids there from doing important things early on.

Okay, so now to my point. When I got into college I still felt like a kid. I did well in school, I did well in life (mostly) but I had no fucking idea that I could actually **DO** things. I spent so much time in the later parts of high school feeling like anything I tried to accomplish wouldn't be taken seriously because I was still a child, and feeling discouraged because I thought that anything I tried to do independently would be perceived as childish, that I ended up doing nothing at all. I only realized that I had an ability to accomplish things greater than assignments and orders from older people when I was almost finished with college. And this, I feel, put me at a serious disadvantage. I realized later in life than some that the most important aspect of accomplishment is taking initiative. I was too happy going to school, having friends and getting drunk because it was what I was "supposed to be doing." 

**TLDR: I regret not realizing that I could take life by the balls in high school** </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh! I doubt I'm going to give you any ammo for "abuse" really. I didn't really consider at the time that you may have been joking, and was trying to point out that the statement is idiotic because what the original poster said had nothing to do with linking the evolutionary fertility of rabbits to gas powered lawn mowers. 

Simply that rabbits have to be so fertile because they so often choose poor locations for their nests. The guy was offering consolation, in that for some little bunnies that get mowed to pieces, hundreds more are getting eaten by various predators cause momma rabbits can't get their shit straight. So there will be more of these little fuckers running around in no time, which is great to think about when you just accidentally chopped a bunch of them up. He was offering consolation, not applying for a grant to study the evolutionary traits of rabbit breeding. 

And that, good sir, is why you were an idiot for posting that remark. But hey, you got the karma for it... so it looks like I'm the one with egg on my face.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't think that you should be desensitized to listen to/watch something like this. It's about understanding the thing that happened and knowing that it did. Perhaps there is some kind of catharsis involved as well. 
It's similar to Eisenhower wanting the world to see what the nazis had done in the concentration camps. Not only desensitized people went to view the atrocities, many people went for different reasons. And we still learn about them today as a reminder of the fucked up things that have happened in history in order to potentially prevent them from happening again. 

I guess to sum things up, "it's great to learn, 'cause knowledge is power!" </TEXT>

	<TEXT> yeah, It's really easy to say things like this. But enduring months upon months of barely eating will drive you crazy. I'm sure that these were good people, for the most part. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think mostly because we read the news for the reporting of facts. Creative style shouldn't have to be parsed from an article to understand the facts. Embellishment leads to misrepresentation. 

Also, I would find it very annoying if I had to read this shit when I was trying to get my news in on the bus to work.  </TEXT>
