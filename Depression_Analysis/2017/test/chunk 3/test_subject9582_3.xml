	<TEXT> Gof or HBP.

Goblet was such a *whodunnit*, and Voldemort comes back, and Albus and Cornelius are on different planets at the end.

For HBP, it grabs you in the second chapter. I remember my wife and I reading it the release night thinking, "What the hell is Snape on about?" (we had always thought he was a good guy) Anyway we learned all about Riddle's past and the horcruxes, and then the ultimate act of bravery(?) happened, and there was nothing but speculation for the next 18 months. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I will. One of my friends in High School and I hung out simply because we had *Hem Hem,* connections. He was my age, and our mutual desire was two years younger.

From our junior year to our senior year, we fought over who was going to take her out. She broke up with him so I assumed she was free game our junior year. I took her out on dates for about three weeks, then we split amicably. 

Long story short, come our senior year we became good friends tying to cock block all of her new male interests. 

Not really *good friends,* but we hung out a lot more the last year.

Edit: We always had a discussion if the guy she was with was good enough for her. </TEXT>

The boy goes and asks his mother: "Mom, would you have sex with the mailman for $500,000?" The mother replies: "Hell yes I would!"

The boy asks his sister: "Would you have sex with your principal for $500,000?" The sister replies: "Hell yes I would!"

As for Krum, his head may be filled with sawdust, but Karkaroff's is not. They'll have a strategy. And you can bet that it will play to Krum's strengths. Come on, Potter, what are you strengths? 

In short, they were all exceptionally powerful. </TEXT>
