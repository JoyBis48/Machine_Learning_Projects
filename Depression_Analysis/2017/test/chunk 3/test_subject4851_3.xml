	<TEXT> 1. Why not take out Hitler instead of shipping the Jews? There were a hand full of people pivotal to the Nazi movement, why not just take them out? Or better, prevent their births?
2.Why not prevent the wars?
Once you start to change anything, you alter the course of history. The future as we know it will no longer exists.
The wars will be inevitable. And wherever it is you ship the Jews to, it is likely they will meet the same fate in the hands of another.

I think the approach of trickles over time will work. But when you start to make 'changes' then I don't think it will work out so well. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We are in agreement on this very point.
It should be that every one gets the proper training and directed guidance customized to them. And not in a one-sided manner. Education in a a broader sense. Basically equipping them whatever they need for a given type of work as well as for being a human being. This should include also intangible things. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Let me get this straight: you think that somehow hiring someone with a Masters degree in computer science and paying for an h1b visa etc just to have them work for you is cheaper than hiring an American with equal qualifications. 
Also, when the owner of said company tells you that there is a shortage, it is nothing but obdurate obstinacy to insist that 'it', the shortage, is a myth. Where do you find your data to back up your claims that there is sufficient supply? Why do you think so many foreigners are lining up to go to school here if there isn't an abundance of demand or shortage of supply of those with their respective degrees?
But don't let any of what I say stop you from holding dearly to your opinion, after all, this is a free country... Right? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's the problem with your reasoning. It is assuming that the gifted ones come from a background of privilege.
Do you see the demographics in graduate school? Hmm? You are looking at life from a1950s lens. You can not do anything in this world without at least a college education. And even if you did, you would need a week educated labor force to execute. The 'labor' you speak of, that is, the skilled manufacturing and similar work from the 50s are the programmers and engineers of today. 
Please stop this idea that education is not necessary. Why do you want to keep importing education from abroad and allowing your own people to wake away? </TEXT>

Such evidence will be dismissed and the investigators' reputation called into question.

One likely scenario is scientists misunderstanding what they have found and forming a new religion and this new religion will promptly being rejected by all existing ones. And so the chain continues...

	<TEXT> Think about having two bio-suits.
Actually, even simpler, think about your clothes. How many do you have? More than two, right? What exactly is going on with your other clothes when 'you' are not wearing them? They are simply lifeless no?
'You' give life to 'your' body. Without 'you', 'your' body is lifeless. It is dead. So perhaps having another suit made will simply result in it being in some kind of vegetative state or just cold and without life. Unless you can figure out a way to plug yourself into it, like changing clothes, then it is impossible to move from one body to another.
I think of this in a similar way to how it is when you sleep....
Actually, this may be the best way to explain it. Perhaps the one body will simply fall into a deep coma/sleep-like state while you occupy another. 
But really, i don't think this idea is possible. It is much more plausible to think of some way to propagate the body from one location to another. Perhaps we should focus on transporting a piece of stone first? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Then use it as a working hypothesis.
There are things constituent of matter, which we know 'hypothetically' to exist but are yet unable to measure, or detect simply because we do not have the instrument powerful enough to measure these things.
On a much more fundamental level, if something was not made up of matter, but something else. Some other substance, call it ethereal or typeB. We know from physics that it will be impossible to have any direct measurement or 'evidence' of said substance using material instruments or tools. You need the right tool fashioned for the right purpose. Otherwise it will be like trying to detect x-rays with a radio or water with a net.... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is the problem with the idea that what is the real you is physical. This body along with the brain is just a bio-machine, wet-ware. Like an exoskeleton used by the actual you for an earth-life. You are plugged in during pregnancy, and disconnect once it is destroyed or no longer functional due to irreparable damage or wear and tear from aging.
It's really not so difficult to accept this is it? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So, let me put it this way:
Reading any of what you've quoted, 'holy' or 'good' is about the last thing that can ever be likened to it. It reads more like gruesome, noisome, disgust, or vermin.
Nothing of what is written in any of these books even sounds holy or good. And we all know who the usual suspects are when things are turned on their head and start to stink: man. This sounds very much like man's idea not something 'good' or 'holy' </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Is the "beast" the government, corporations or is it simply you and I as a depraved collective unit? Government - I don't have any brilliant ideas except collective action. Similar to what the 'patriots' in days of yore did.
Corporations - avoid products and services directly and indirectly. Again this requires collective action.

And so the only logical conclusion here is that all of these point back to us as a collective unit being the proverbial beast. 

This is me just thinking out loud... </TEXT>
