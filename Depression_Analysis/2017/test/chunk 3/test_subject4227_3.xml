	<TEXT> I think Leibniz solved the problem of evil pretty well. At least better than many of the competing theories that come from your average modern Christian. Basically God in his infinite knowledge created our universe. Our universe was the best possible option, which includes not mKing the universe at all. The current reality that we live in has the least amount of evil possible, and it is still better than the option of not existing. Keep in mind this is a very basic outline of the Leibniz's argument.  </TEXT>
