	<TEXT>  Hello everyone, I was just looking at the reddit comments for the drift stage video and I noticed that some of you seem to like retro/80's synth music. So please; sit down, make yourself comfortable, pop a boner and let's circlejerk about some music! :)

*unzips pants* I'll start, I'm absolutely in love with the hotline Miami sound track, all the songs just fit so well, their psychedelic but still danceable. As for artist I love Mitch Murder if you don't know who he is then let me tell you why you should love him, 4 words: [He remixed Guiles theme](https://soundcloud.com/daataa/mitch-murder-guiles-theme) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> [Japanese stream hardcore 4 album preview](http://youtu.be/IZRvaeJUKjw) my favorite song from this album is clock control by Kobaryo, the melody is spot on 

[Massive Circlez 2 cross fade demo](http://youtu.be/IZRvaeJUKjw) all the Massive Circlez compilations are gold, most Japanese producers make all kinds of hard dance but the massive new krew consistantaly make Hardstyle so check them out

As for buying these... Well most Japanese releases I've seen are physical copy only and they are only available from various Japanese websites (so unless you speak Japanese or your browser translates it for you, you might have a hard time finding out if the CD's are still in stock / if they ship outside of Japan). the Japanese stream hardcore comps. Are on iTunes as for the Massive Circlez you might have to result to torrenting. I can PM you the torrent file if need be </TEXT>

Can our young lovers keep their gear from degrading? Will the solider ever put a point into psi powers so he can finally use kinetic redirection? Will the AI ever stop making fun of humans and their shitty skin and organs? I don't know maybe.... Ya maybe. Find out if your questions will ever be answered on April 11th, 1999 all while listening to a sound track that's made up of orchestral music and 1999 DnB and trance with lazy flanging to make it more trancy! </TEXT>
