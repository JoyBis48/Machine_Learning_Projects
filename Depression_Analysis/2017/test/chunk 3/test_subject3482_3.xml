	<TEXT> What I thought was romantic at the time: Back in the early days of the internet, my gf at the time and I were doing our respective internships. I had internet at work which was fantastic. She only had access to email but no internet and constantly needed to look things up. So I stayed awake all weekend and wrote her a program that ran on my home desktop computer where she could email  search query and my computer would email the Yahoo or Altavista results (can't remember which) back to her. Then she could email the result link and it would download the page and email it to her as a static html page (the whole web was static html at the time so this was the easy part). 

What on hindsight was actually romantic? My gf and I lived in two different continents. I did 5 years of long distance. We moved to a 3rd continent, and then I moved cities twice, before finally moving in with her and now she is my wife and its been 10 years since we started dating. One of my better decisions.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think its better to do marketing at a larger company, even if that means starting at an entry-level type role. It can be a good career path, a chance to learn data and analytics tools that are increasingly important in marketing today and a chance to get some branding on your resume. Risk with small agencies is that you end up with a decent job but not a great career trajectory from there.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What industry? Sales in general? If you have an aptitude for sales (some do, some don't) its very viable. Good sales people over time can either go on to either sell larger and more complex products and make meaningfully more money, go into strategic / business development roles, or take on sales leadership roles. So there is a valid career path if thats what you are interested in.

The same goes for marketing. 

Candidly - your best bet is either to go to a large organization where you can have meaningful career growth opportunities, mentorship and training, or to go to a decent sized startup that is growing fast so you get chances to grow alongside the company. The startup path is definitely more risky.

My advice to you would be to think about how to move to a company that can give you those types of career challenges and get you into more of a business role. You are absolutely right not to want to stay in administration. Sales / Marketing / Biz Dev at the right organizations will never go away and will always be rewarded.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Given that you have marketing experience and a marketing focused education (admittedly a minor), there is no reason why you shouldn't try and get a marketing job. 

This is a list of such roles that could be interesting:

http://tapwage.com/channel/fight-night-marketers

You could also potentially look at sales, especially ad-sales which is an interesting and lucrative path. Jobs like these:

http://tapwage.com/channel/selling-eyeballs

If you want to stay around fashion, there are a number of fashion focused startups you could look at as well. These are interesting because they might find parts of your background really interesting, they are more open ended roles where your responsibilities can grow as the company grows, and you can then transition into bigger roles at more established companies.

The way you position yourself in your resume and interview is really critical for any of these. If you come across too administrative focused, you often get typecast into office manager / admin roles. You really need to emphasize the marketing experience, show that you understand the broader industry dynamic and trends and had a more business-oriented role. Emphasizing quantitative and analytical skills over things like HTML / Photoshop will be helpful too (once you veer into HTML ./ Photoshop, people are unlikely to take you too seriously in a more marketing / analytics roles)

	<TEXT> Look for some Unity  / Open GL related open source projects on github and try and become a contributor to one of those teams. Having code contribution at a public project is often more impressive and a better validation of your skills to an employer than a private project you might do. Also good experience working with other developers and learning about the more practical elements of development </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Consulting and Risk management have very structured recruiting cycles so you can apply for those roles but unless you are prepared on the path, its difficult to break into. 

Here are junior risk management jobs:
http://tapwage.com/channel/beach-closed-due-to-credit-risk-sighting

Here are junior consulting jobs:
http://tapwage.com/channel/from-consultant-to-corporate

For risk management, my advice would be to focus on non New York jobs that are more geared towards consumer risk management since those are easier to get into

A few other potential careers to think about:
1. HR: I know a lot of humanities majors that got a break into the corporate world in an HR role. These can be useful entry points and fairly interesting jobs. Like these:
http://tapwage.com/channel/people-person-unicorn-edition

2. Another option is potentially doing a writing job
http://tapwage.com/channel/pop-culture-writers

3. There are a number of Non-profit jobs here that don't require a masters degree

http://tapwage.com/channel/giving-back-to-the-art

unfortunately, each of these will take you away from your goal of IR.

Another option is to try and move into impact investing. This is a really interesting career. Will combine your finance and analytical skills with your desire to do something more meaningful for society, traveling and adventure. Collection of such jobs here:

	<TEXT> Sorry that it took a while to come back to you. We are upgrading our search engine on our site to be instant and better. Once thats done I can point you to some interesting opportunities. 

One category of job that could be interesting is financial operations/  business analyst. This is inline with what a few people before said about potentially looking at banks. Some of these only require an associate degree or a GED. They have a real career path in finance and ops, and are less people-oriented and a chance to shape an interesting career

http://tapwage.com/searchresult?keyword=financial+operations location=Florida

Another option is to be an office manager. Also a good job with your skill set, a potential operations and administrative career path and potentially a better pay and perks than retail

http://tapwage.com/searchresult?keyword=office+manager location=Florida sortBy=relevance

We'll have an updated instant search engine by the end of the week so will be a lot easier to search for these jobs and you should be able to find quite a few in Florida / Southwest. 

Hope it gives you a few ideas about where to look.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Business development is one option. This is sort of sales-like but also involves strategic deals, partnership, channel management and can be really interesting - especially at a startup or a more nimble company. Jobs like these:
http://tapwage.com/channel/if-you-start-me-up-if-you-start-me-up-ill-never-stop
http://tapwage.com/channel/unicorn-business-developer

Alternatively, you could look at ad-sales if you have the experience. Its not like direct sales at all and can be a lot more fun and lucrative. Jobs like these:
http://tapwage.com/channel/selling-eyeballs

Finally - you could also look at more B2B / enterprise sales. These are very lucrative and are completely different than direct sales / home improvement sales but leverage your background. But many of these require some specific skill sets / experience so might be hard to get.

	<TEXT> Given how much data science is in fashion, depending on the city, there should be no reason to take a significant payout. Your engineering background will definitely help, as will the fact that you are learning Python and R. But as NotARandomNumber points out, it depends on location. NY, LA, SF, DC are much likely to pay 100k+ than some of the smaller cities.

A few ideas for you:
Data science is a misleading category since that typically involves a PhD. There are a ton of great data and analytics roles out there that don't involve PhD but they aren't always labelled data science

Here are some data and analytics jobs in finance / large banks that you could consider:

http://tapwage.com/channel/artificial-intelligence-meets-financial-intelligence

You could also consider data analytical positions at large corporations (ignore the MBA in the title. MBA is preferred but they are open to quant degrees)

http://tapwage.com/channel/data-driven-mbas-at-big-corporates

Look at operational jobs that specifically value military and naval backgrounds. These can be wide ranging, very interesting and are increasingly strategic and analytical. Examples of such jobs is here:

http://tapwage.com/channel/operating-with-military-precision

May of these will also consider and reward your engineering background
Let me know if you are looking for something more specific with your background and I can try to point you in the right direction. Good luck! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thats a really difficult situation with loans. My #1 advice would be to create a compelling portfolio of writing samples that you can customize for various jobs. 

If you are struggling to get a gig at a big media outlet, try and get a foot in the door with a digital media startup (there are so many out there these days and they are hiring aggressively). 

here is a set of journalism jobs. If you get your foot in the door at a place like Vox or one of the other digital media entities, the pay isn't great out of the gate, but depending on where you life it might allow your friend to cut down to just 1 full time job. Gives you a chance to build a public portfolio, get some visibility and navigate into a more serious journalism role down the line.

	<TEXT> You don't need a liberal arts degree. You just need to write well. If you want to be a journalist, you should, and there are a number of business journalist jobs out there in both traditional media publications / TV outlets and new digital media outlets. 

Look at these jobs here:
http://tapwage.com/searchresult?keyword=business+reporter location=

or this journalism collection here:
http://tapwage.com/channel/reporting-the-news

These jobs generally don't require journalist degrees. They just need good writing samples which hopefully you have. 

Moreover, there are very few reporters with real understanding of accounting and finance so you could leverage your background to give you a leg up by writing about M A, finance, business etc. I would add these to your writing samples so you really stand out for some of these jobs. Good luck! </TEXT>
