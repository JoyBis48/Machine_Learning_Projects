	<TEXT> Now keep in mind, I don't know any Japanese. I know I can just go to Google, but I want to check with a native speaker because its for a tattoo. Basically, its a series of tattoos based on movies and games that, growing up, captivated and inspired my imagination. Simply I want to get the words "Never Stop Dreaming," in Hylian, and the era of [Hylian](https://i.imgur.com/Z05eact.jpg) I want to use is based off of Japanese.  So if anybody can translate it for me, and also transliterate it to the Latin alphabet. As is my key. I would be eternally grateful.  </TEXT>
