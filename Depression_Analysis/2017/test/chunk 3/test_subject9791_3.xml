	<TEXT> I honestly think it was actually a segment meant to get Reigns over, but Heyman, being Heyman, well maybe he feels that he would give his 2 cents, in a non direct kind of way

I do honestly feel he was being sarcastic. When he went to the ring, he looks visibly scared of DBry, but he was not so of Reigns. Why would you be scared of a guy that had lost to the person that you're going to meet?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't think that's true. The only thing they told their customer teams were not to use a higher engine power mapping (than what the works team are using) if they are in fight with the works team. It was in one of Ted's feature in Bahrain when they were talking to Smedley. 

Officially it's to stop both team to one up each other in term of the engine power in a race, which could lead both engine to retire prematurely (the ICE need to last 4 races) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It started in the 90s I think, when a driver has to nominate which tyres they would use in the race. The tyre manufacturer will bring two compounds, a prime (which would be the safe tyre) or the option (a softer tyre that would be faster but won't last as long). 

Once you made the decision, you will be stuck with it for the whole of the race. As you can see at this moment in history, there is no reason for tyre mismatch, as you're stuck with one compound of tyres!

The Option + Prime combo usage was decided by Bernie to spice up racing, as seen from it's highly effective use in America's CART series. A lot of people have asked if they can mix and match the tyre compound, as every year you would hear Martin Brundle mention it at least twice. But the FIA had shot down the idea quickly as it would be "confusing to the viewers".

Note that not only you can't mix the tyre compounds, but you also can't switch which tyre side. For example you can't switch a left front tyre to a front right tyre. Juan Pablo Montoya's McLaren had it's front tyre mistakenly switch around, and in the race he complained that the car felt like it had a puncture.  </TEXT>

Most of the ex drivers or the one inside the business are good pundits, or opinion givers, but they are not writers. It's a different thing talking compared to writing an article piece. 

I do still read the magazine tho, because sometimes there might be hidden gems, really good articles that you did not expect to read. But those are rare and few.

	<TEXT> Depends on the chipset. Only LGA2011's X79 and X99 chipset supports for quad channel RAM, hence the 8 RAM slots. You won't usually see normal consumer use this, as these are targeted for really hardcore gamers/overclockers, and cost a bomb

If you're sticking to the Intel Z97/Z87 based boards, you won't get more than 4 RAM slots as the processor only supports dual channel RAM </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No, but if you're an overclocker, those extra capacitors and MOSFETS on the larger board leads to better and much more stable overclocking. Hence why you don't see overclockers use mini ITX boards </TEXT>

Singapore could in theory swap place with Malaysia, making it Australia - singapore - Bahrain, but that would mean putting Singapore in the rainy season, and they don't want this to happen.

besides, a dry Malaysia is miles better than a dry Singapore, what's more a wet Sepang? </TEXT>
