	<TEXT> HesKicks made these and called them the Kyrie 1 iD "Mag", after the Air Mag. Then, when All-Stars came around and the All-Star colourways were being released, they released something [very similar] (http://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NTI5WDk0MA==/z/7j8AAOSweW5U31tN/$_35.JPG) to these. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Some [Vans Authentic] (http://www.vans.com/shop/canvas-authentic-black) would probably be good. They're only around $50 and come in just about every fucking color in the rainbow.

Or [Converse] (http://www.converse.com/regular/chuck-taylor-classic-colors/MP_51.html), cause you can never go wrong with some Chucks. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> First heard about this theory [here] (http://www.djbooth.net/index/news/entry/2015-04-06-chance-the-rapper-new-album).

I mean it makes a good bit of sense I guess but I don't think that much logic is behind it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This has to do with the switch from the Julian calender to the Gregorian calender. January and Fabuary I think weren't in the Julian and then inserted into the Gregorian, thus pushing October two months ahead.

Edit: I am wrong. </TEXT>
