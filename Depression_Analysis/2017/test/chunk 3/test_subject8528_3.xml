* You may want to fix your typos
* Try to keep titles consistent
* Remove the unnecessary capitalization 


A bit of a personal thing, but I cannot see Nogizaka Haruka no Himitsu Season 2 being better than Toradora. Heck, the characters were worse than the first season.

	<TEXT> Other than some OEL stuff and some light novels, the first volume of manga that I bought was Volume 1 of Nisekoi while I was in Japan. (If manga were that cheap here, I would buy a lot more of it. It was ~$4 USD instead of the $10 it would be in English)

I know why it is more in the US, but I can still gripe about it. (Licensing it, translation, redrawing, cover design changes if needed, printing, advertising, shipping, etc)  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Did anyone else see [this?!?!?!](http://i.imgur.com/guof8lv.jpg) During the part where Archer is preparing his sword/arrow/drill there was a series of ~6-8 frames where it flashes Emiya's "Trace On" but it has Archer's hand/arm behind it. 

I stepped through the frames and this is the clearest one that has them both in it.

NOTE: I haven't played UBW, so I have no idea if this is of major importance. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It is a light novel series in which each chapter is important to the story that they couldn't skip much, if any, of it. So far, there are 216 chapters out, 214 have been translated. To give the series its full worth, it would have to be a good number of episodes. (100 may be stretching it, but I would see 50+) 

The story also comprises the life of Rudeus starting from his infancy. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Without compression, this is how it would turn out: The resolution would be 1280x720 so 345600 pixels. Since every color can be expressed by a 0-255 integer and there are three colors that comprise one pixel there are a total of 1036800 integers at a time. Considering that they can use an integer that only takes 8 bits of data (2^8 -1, which is 0-255) this means that a single frame takes up 1.037 MB. At thirty frames a second it would be 31.11 MB/s.

Now, this is why people have developed compression for video as you do not need to send every frame but only the pixels that have changed. 

---
For a true idea of the amount of data that it would take: According to [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/vita/comments/1r6fz4/ps4ps_vita_remote_plays_uses_2030mbs_per_minute/) post on /r/vita the PS4-PS Vita uses ~20-30 MB per minute. (So anywhere from 0.33-0.5 MB/s) Odds are the PS4-PS4 uses the same idea and code as the PS4-Vita remote play so this should be about right.

EDIT: Removed trailing parenthesis and elaborated on the last sentence of the "Without compression" part. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Do you have access to a black/whiteboard? One of the games that the anime club at my university plays is something along the lines of pictionary where you have one person draw something from a show and people have to guess where it is from or what character it is.

You'd have to have someone, who is running it, that pulls aside the person before they start drawing and ask them who/what they are going to draw so that when people guess you can judge whether it is right or wrong.

It is pretty fun and it can go for any length of time, but thirty minutes would be more than enough. </TEXT>

Even when she visited the university that I went to last year there were really high contentions. She had to have bodyguards and such. One thing, that I do not like about her is that she had someone pre-screen all of the questions from students even thought it was written in the contract that the Q A would be open. (Heck, she didn't even want a Q A session.) 

She talks about being a journalist but yet she does not follow the conventions of not censoring (ie. Pre-screening) speech...


As for the "feminist" side she wasn't the stereotypical nutty feminist that people make her out to be. Yeah, she tends to pick the major and blatant examples that fits her arguments but she presents them in a logical manner. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not only is it a Steinway it is, most likely, a model D (9-ft grand piano used, mainly, in concert halls and it costs about $150,000 USD). They even got the internals from the main brass "Chassis" to the shape/color of the hammers to even the piano stool that they use. I think they even used a Steinway when producing the music as it sounds the same as the Steinways that I have heard.

Source: I see and hear a model D every single day and it always has its lid up, during the day. (All Steinway School) Sadly the thing is normally playing itself... :(

My thoughts are that you ought to make this as a "Request" thread but put the same rules and such in that post. 

My concern is that if we have this weekly, people will begin suggesting the same shows over and over until they get popular enough to break the qualifications. 

You may want to message the mods with the suggestion for a routine stickied post much like our current weekly suggestion threads. (I'd do it myself, but you are the one who has the idea and may be able to word it better than someone interpreting your post.) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am *shocked* that no one has mentioned the instruments in this episode!

They did an AMAZING job showing the instruments and the action of the keys, hammers and what not.

The Steinway   Sons piano is accurate down to the number of holes in the support, the model of the piano bench and everything else. (Source: I attend an all-Steinway university so I have seen them up close and even played them a bit. I am no where proficient with the piano but I have taken a little bit of lessons before.)

The keys that were played, throughout the episode, were accurate which really showed during the melodica scene during the trill around 17:07 is where I really noticed it. </TEXT>

I guess, now the question isn't of who but why and how they are doing what they are doing.

I'll stick with this one as it seems as though it is a light-hearted series. Also, the VN is made by August who made "Brighter than the Dawning Blue" and "Fortune Arterial". (They've made others, but those two have been adapted into anime.) </TEXT>
