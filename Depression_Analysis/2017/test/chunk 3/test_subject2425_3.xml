	<TEXT> Hey reddit, i have just started trying to learn after effects. I downloaded a template on youtube and played around with it for fun. But my question is, how can i get the rain to continue through the whole video? It cuts off when the text appears. Thanks for the help, it really means a lot to me as a beginner.

	<TEXT> Yeah, definitely go with the 7770ghz. Go to pcpartpicker.com and filter the gpu selection out and it will find you the lowest price. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What is your budget? The best value for a gpu right now is the gtx 760 for the 200-300 dollar price range(if you SLI 2 of them together, it is a great deal more powerful than the 780.). If you want something sub 100 dollar range, get the 7770 ghz edition. The ghz edition ironically goes for less most of the time than the regular 7770. If you aren't looking for cuda cores for programs that will utilize them (adobe after effects, photoshop, fireworks, etc.) or are wanting to sli 2 or more gpus together then go amd. The 7770ghz pulls about 60 fps on high on battlefield 3 with buffs like anti-aliasing turned down. Hope i helped you out. </TEXT>
