	<TEXT> It is SO not your fault. Accidents happen. You didn't do anything wrong. Also, I'm sorry you're having a hard time with your transition. It's this awful cycle where being in the wrong body makes you depressed and being depressed makes you unsuitable for T and surgery, which makes you more depressed, etc. I hope you hang in there OP. Feel free to PM me if you wanna talk. I have a little experience. Not in the dead guy department but in the trans department. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I had this theory but I haven't been able to figure it out myself. Op's username spelled on the keyboard of a phone could spell KNOCK with an extra letter. Op sent me : 42764440. I don't know if I'm patient enough to figure out what all the numbers could mean but maybe if it's a group effort?
Edit - for this cipher to work, the 1's don't mean anything.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Stop panicking. You're going to be okay you just have to stay calm and be logical. Make a list of things you need: food, water, etc. Then make a list of ways to get those things. You're alone there so what about taking what you need and keeping track of it so you can repay it? That would ease your conscience. Better yet if the store computer systems are working, scan your items, go through the process on screen, and print yourself a receipt. As for fuel for your car, there are tanks underground in the parking lot of most gas stations. They're covered by manhole covers which you can lift and drop a bucket into the tank to get fuel. It's easier than siphoning. 

Edit: PM me if you need someone to talk to/more advice. I'm always here.

Edit 2: Go to a camping or sports store or even some hardware type of place and get a wind up flashlight with electrical outlets on it. You can wind the handle to charge your phone in case of loss of electricity. This is a must and needs to be done asap so you can keep in contact. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you can get to a gas station, you can lift the covers and drop a bucket into the underground tanks. They all have access covers so they can do dips to check the level in the holding tank. Usually on a far side of the parking lot without a lot of parking spaces around it. It's easier than siphoning but be careful of sparks or any source of ignition. </TEXT>

There's an online database of medical professionals who are lifestyle-friendly. Check out fetlife.com groups. Someone can ALWAYS help. Maybe you both should talk to someone. Good luck.

OP, I believe your daughter. Don't push about the mug. Ask her if her friends took the pictures, how she met them, when she sees them, etc. Maybe also don't leave the younger daughter alone with her for a little while, just in case. Not because she'll hurt her but because the friends might. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In fear of having weird stuff start happening to me, I'm too interested to not help.
The numbers. Has anyone looked at their cell phone lately? 5 (JKL) 6 (MNO) 1 is blank so a space I assume, and 2 (ABC).
Can anyone make a word or three words I guess out of those letters? Even if it's just a sound or something?

Edit: More thoughts.
The number is an OCLC number in the worldcat.org library system. It's for a mircofilm. I'm gonna include a link just in case Cymon and Iphigenia is somehow relevant. http://www.worldcat.org/title/cymon-and-iphigenia-painted-by-sir-frederick-leighton-the-story-of-the-picture-illustrated/oclc/561621561 </TEXT>
