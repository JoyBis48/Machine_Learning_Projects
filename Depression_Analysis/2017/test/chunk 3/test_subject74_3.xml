	<TEXT> Last time I got a BMI test done at my ymca that included a body fat percentage...It was around 24.1% and my waist is around 27 inches. So, according to that I'd be average.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I will be honest with you, I do not like what I see in the mirror most days. It's easy for me to pick out the flaws instead of 'good parts'. And I don't receive compliments very often.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Wondering about BMI and if there's anything better out there. </TITLE>

	<TEXT> My BMI is 23.4, which is on the higher side of normal weights based on the calculator I used...Now, I'm 5'1...124 lbs...and I'm a 19 year old female...Is this a normal weight for my height and age? I've been made to feel like its not by most BMI calculators etc. I also gained a lot of weight in the past year...I started community college last year and gained 20 lbs. I used to be 110, so I've lost about 6 lbs since I gained weight. I think this might be why I'm so worried about my weight but I'm interested in getting opinions as mine may be biased. Any advice is appreciated.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I find after 2 coats its looks opaque on my nails, I absolutely love it...Maybe try a clear coat over top if you're finding it too thin?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, I'm learning its better just to do it myself! haha, mine don't turn out every time but atleast I'm only paying out for polish and remover! I totally agree with you, I'd feel soo bad if I couldn't give someone exactly what they wanted for their mani. I'm sure your nails always look beautiful, they definitely do in the now picture! :)  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, you're definitely right...I didn't wait long enough for it to dry...I thought I did but I didn't. And I didn't have any clear coat besides glitter. I know for next time though! In hindsight I should've left them white with the purple and pink middle piece. It looked tidy.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No problem! And I am too, it's a really shitty experience for her to have during her second tattoo...I told her most artists aren't like that and everything and she seemed to get it but I'm sure she's holding off on getting more for awhile.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> She was a guest artist so I don't think I'll ever see her around again. But, if anyone asks me about my opinion of her ever I'll keep chode in mind as a describing word.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Admittedly she was, I cringed at her behaviour and didn't encourage it at all, but it still didn't justify the reaction from the artist in my opinion. She's even been  tattooed before and wasn't an annoying client at all. I was honestly very surprised by both of them but I expected the artist to react in a professional manor.   </TEXT>
