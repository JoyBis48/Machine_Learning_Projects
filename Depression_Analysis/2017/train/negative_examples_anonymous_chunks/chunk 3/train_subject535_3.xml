The retraction was over the fact that do to the small sample size of 10 rats per sex per group and 2 year duration of the study it was physically unable to draw meaning conclusion on either general toxicology or carcinogenicity. 
  
[The common protocol for sub chronic toxicity dictates 10 rats per sex per group for 13 weeks.](http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/environment/test-no-408-repeated-dose-90-day-oral-toxicity-study-in-rodents_9789264070707-en)

[Here is a study that modeled the effect on decreasing sample size of a carcinogenicity study](http://www.ams.sunysb.edu/~hahn/psfile/papyang.pdf)
  
[Relevant section showing the decrease in power from 50 rats per group down to 30.](http://i.imgur.com/MEhC8C8.png) This is in contrast to the 10 rats per group that Seralini decided to use for his study.


Seralini ran a bastardization between a sub chronic toxicity study and a carcinogenicity study, with using only 10 rats per sex per group and running it for 2 years.  
  
Also Seralini did not run any statistical analysis on mortality or tumor prevalence. His data, due to sample size and short duration was inadequate to determine if any of his observed effects were statitically significant.

The retraction was in line with COPE guidelines.  
  
  
[The COPE guidelines were consulted when making this decision. According to the COPE guidelines, Journal editors should consider retracting a publication if they have clear evidence that the findings are unreliable, either as a result of misconduct (e.g. data fabrication) or honest error (e.g. miscalculation or experimental error).(COPE, 2009). The retraction statement could have been clearer, and should have referred to the relevant COPE guidelines. The data are inconclusive, therefore the claim (ie, conclusion) that Roundup Ready maize NK603 and/or the Roundup herbicide have a link to cancer is unreliable. Dr. Sralini deserves the benefit of the doubt that this unreliable conclusion was reached in honest error.)](http://www.elsevier.com/about/press-releases/research-and-journals/food-and-chemical-toxicology-editor-in-chief,-a.-wallace-hayes,-publishes-response-to-letters-to-the-editors#sthash.2el1IrEj.dpuf)
  
Here are some responses to the original 2012 Seralini study, finding short comings in both design and statistical methods used.  
  
http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278691512007843

http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278691512007892
  
[Here is the original EFSA report that highlighted short comings and error in the 2012 Seralini study.](http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/pub/2986.htm)   
  
  
EFSA finds that the study as reported by Sralini et al. is of insufficient scientific quality for safety assessments. EFSA concludes that the currently available evidence does not impact on the ongoing re-evaluation of glyphosate and does not call for the reopening of the safety evaluations of maize NK603 and its related stacks.
 
  
[Here is Health Canada's response.](http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fn-an/gmf-agm/seralini-eng.php)  
  
  
Based on Health Canada and CFIAs review of this information [the Seralini study], the authors conclusions concerning the long term safety of NK603 corn and glyphosate are not supported
  
[Food Standards Australia/New Zealand](http://www.foodstandards.gov.au/consumer/gmfood/seralini/pages/default.aspx)  
  

  
On the basis of the many scientific deficiencies identified in the study, FSANZ does not accept the conclusions made by the authors [Seralini et al] and has therefore found no justification to reconsider the safety of NK603 corn

[Belgian Biosafety Advisory Council report](http://www.bio-council.be/docs/BAC_2012_0898_CONSOLIDE.pdf)  
  
  
Here is a great quote on their opinion on Seralini 2012  
  
It should never have been accepted for publication in a scientific journal. The process of peer review which is usual before acceptance for publication in scientific journals has clearly failed here.

[High Council of Biotechnolgies conclusion.](http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/doc/2986ax1.pdf)
  

  Consequently, the HCB Scientific Committee considers that the paper offers no information supporting the existence of a health risk associated with consumption of maize NK603, whether or not treated with a Roundup herbicide formulation. 

[ANSES Opinion](http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/doc/2986ax1.pdf)

**Conclusion on study Results**
  
[The significant results obtained before correction are not biologically coherent overall. However, biological data on the results would be needed to draw a definitive conclusion. At this point in time, in light of the information provided in the publication, the ECEAGs experts consider that the authors interpretations are not sufficiently corroborated by the study data. 
Moreover, during the hearing, the studys authors admitted that this study was not conclusive by itself and that, though subject to improvement, it had the merit of opening up an interesting line of research. 
From ANSES opinion from their evaluation of the Seralini study on pathologies.](http://i.imgur.com/W0OJGIg.png)
  
[Here is the relevant chart.](http://i.imgur.com/BxD7sAb.png)  


[Monsanto's response to the study](http://www.monsanto.com/products/Documents/ProductSafety/seralini-sept-2012-monsanto-comments.pdf)  
  
  

[Here is a Nature article on the controversy.](http://www.nature.com/news/hyped-gm-maize-study-faces-growing-scrutiny-1.11566)
  
Also this was not the first long term GMO feeding study.  
  
[Sakamoto's 104 week feeding study was, it looked at GMO soybeans and failed to find harm interms of carcinogenicity in Wisker rats.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18787312)
  
[Also here is some info on who funded CRIIGEN to do this study.](http://gmopundit.blogspot.com/2012/09/auchan-and-carrefour-financed-criigen.html)



 
The study was recently republished in a relatively new journal with minor changes to wording and can be found [here.](http://www.enveurope.com/content/26/1/14)
  
[Here is the response by several scientist of the republishing of this study.](http://www.geneticliteracyproject.org/2014/06/24/scientists-react-to-republished-seralini-maize-rat-study/)

[Here is a Nature article on the republication of the Seralini et al study.](http://www.nature.com/news/paper-claiming-gm-link-with-tumours-re-published-1.15463)
  
I also like this quote I found by Tom Sanders who is a professor of nutrition and dietetics at King's College London.
  

Republishing data that was faulty in the first place in study design and analysis does not provide redemption. Furthermore, it is now possible to publish almost anything in open access journals 
  
[Also the republication was not peer reviewed.](http://retractionwatch.com/2014/06/26/republished-seralini-gmo-rat-study-was-not-peer-reviewed-says-editor/)
  
Here is a quote of Seralini admitting that the goal of the study was to ban GMOs.
  
["What we want to achieve with this study is a moratorium"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njd0RugGjAg amp;t=10m45s)
  
**TLDR:** Seralini's 2012 study is full of elementary mistakes and follows an inadequate protocol that fails to support the conclusions it makes. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> According to Argentina's union of medical professionals, Fesprosa, glyphosate, not only causes cancer. It is also associated with increased spontaneous abortions, birth defects, skin diseases, and respiratory and neurological disease. 

  
Here are some studies and reviews on the safety and risk of glyphosate.
  



[Safety Evaluation and Risk Assessment of the Herbicide Roundup and Its Active Ingredient, Glyphosate, for Humans](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0273230099913715)
  
  
  
[Developmental and reproductive outcomes in humans and animals after glyphosate exposure: a critical analysis.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22202229)
  
[Epidemiologic studies of glyphosate and non-cancer health outcomes: a review.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21798302)

[Review of genotoxicity studies of glyphosate and glyphosate-based formulations](http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.3109/10408444.2013.770820#.)

  
  [Here's a safety analysis of glyphosate in many animal studies.](http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2006/9241665203_eng.pdf)
  
  


[Evaluation of carcinogenic potential of the herbicide glyphosate, drawing on tumor incidence data from fourteen chronic/carcinogenicity rodent studies](http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.3109/10408444.2014.1003423)
  
There was no evidence of a carcinogenic effect related toglyphosatetreatment. The lack of a plausible mechanism, along with published epidemiology studies, which fail to demonstrate clear, statistically significant, unbiased and non-confounded associations betweenglyphosateand cancer of any single etiology, and a compelling weight of evidence, support the conclusion thatglyphosatedoes not present concern with respect to carcinogenic potential in humans.


[Cancer Incidence among Glyphosate-Exposed Pesticide Applicators in the Agricultural Health Study](http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/3435746?uid=2 uid=4 sid=21104202186197)
  
Note that there was a weak but slight association with multiple myeloma that the authors suggest that further follow up is required. Also this was among applicators who inherently are exposed to significantly higher amounts of glyphosate than end product consumers.

  
Also a re-analysis of the AHS data failed to show the same link between glyphosate and multiple meyloma. 
  

[Multiple Myeloma and Glyphosate Use: A Re-Analysis of US Agricultural Health Study (AHS) Data](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25635915)
 
  
[Epidemiologic studies of glyphosate and cancer: A review](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0273230012000943)
  
To examine potential cancer risks in humans, we reviewed the epidemiologic literature to evaluate whether exposure to glyphosate is associated causally with cancer risk in humans. We also reviewed relevant methodological and biomonitoring studies of glyphosate. Seven cohort studies and fourteen case-control studies examined the association between glyphosate and one or more cancer outcomes. Our review found no consistent pattern of positive associations indicating a causal relationship between total cancer (in adults or children) or any site-specific cancer and exposure to glyphosate.

	<TEXT> Monsanto has never sued over accidental cross pollination of their crops. 
  
About the Schmeiser case.  

 I'll quote the actual court case.
  
[In late June or early July of 1997, Mr. Schmeiser and his employee Carlyle Moritz hand sprayed Roundup around power poles and in the ditches along the Bruno road where it bordered fields 1, 2, 3 and 4. This was part of his normal weed control practice. Several days after the spraying, he noticed that a large number of canola plants had survived the spraying. To determine why the canola plants had survived the Roundup spraying, Mr. Schmeiser conducted a test in field 2. Using a machine sprayer set to spray 40 feet, he sprayed Roundup on a section of field 2 in a strip along the road. He made two passes, the first weaving between and around the power poles and the second adjacent to the first pass, parallel to the power poles. He testified that by this means he sprayed a good three acres of field 2. According to Mr. Schmeiser's evidence, after some days, approximately 60% of the canola plants sprayed were still alive, growing in clumps that were thickest near the road and thinner as one moved into the field.[23]At harvest time in 1997 Mr. Schmeiser, who was then recovering from a leg injury, instructed Mr. Moritz to swath and combine field 2. Mr. Moritz did so, harvesting the canola in the field as well as the surviving canola along the roadside. The harvested seed was put into the box of a 1962 Ford pickup truck. The box was covered with a tarp and the truck with its tarped load of canola seed was stored in one of Mr. Schmeiser's buildings over the winter.[24]Mr. Schmeiser testified that in the spring of 1998 the seed from the Ford truck was transferred to another truck and taken to the Humboldt Flour Mill for treatment, a normal process to rid the seeds of disease before planting. The treated seed, mixed with untreated seed from his granary ("bin-run seed"), was planted in all or part of each of his nine fields, for a total of 1,030 acres.](http://decisions.fca-caf.gc.ca/en/2002/2002fca309/2002fca309.html)  
  
  
His crop did not magically become 95-98% RR canola purity overnight and the court realized this. Schmeiser was not sued over accidental cross pollination, but over intentionally isolating RR canola plants and planting the seed the following year.  </TEXT>
