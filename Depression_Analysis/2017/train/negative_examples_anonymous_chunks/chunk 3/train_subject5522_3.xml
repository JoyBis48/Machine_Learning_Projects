	<TEXT> Serious advice: be paranoid. Cover your identity carefully. Only send e-mail if you can secure it. Stay anonymous. Use VPNs. Wipe traces of what you do. Organize yourselves but be smart. Be careful who you trust, you WILL be infiltrated. Never openly advocate violence or let anyone trick you into advocating that. Watch a movie called the Battle of Algiers from the 50s for amazing tips on organizing secretly using the principle of threes. Don't openly call yourselves Anarchist. Stick to something like left wing libertarian or another nicer sounding name. 
Be smart, be safe, and good luck! I wish you the best, it makes me very happy to hear that your group exists! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes we are. Martial law has many layers, and we've been living under it since WW1. There have been decades long programs to keep people under control. This goes back to the violent suppression of socialist and anarchist groups in 1918 by the Bureau of Investigation, precursor to the FBI. Eddie Bernays work in propaganda and later PR was massively connected to dissuading people from radical politics by promoting consumerism. Our society has been deliberately kept docile and apolitical.

Troops on the street are a manifestation of the existing reality. They come out when the powers that be feel they are useful. Just because troops are not on the ground during certain periods, don't be fooled into thinking that there's no martial law. </TEXT>

However I totally disagree on point three, I know people in Baltimore and the activism during the Ferguson protests and since has been widespread. The organized protests against the Freddie Gray killing were big and peaceful. I think there has to be a distinction between people who engage in criminality and the majority who do not.  Many of those involved in organizing protests against the police have been on the front line attempting to stop the violence. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'll give it a stab: Hoover... bad man... FBI program to frame and disrupt political activities by blacks, Latinos, lefties, and college kids... highly illegal... Fred Hampton and other Panthers murdered... Vietnam protesters harassed, John Lennon followed, mass infiltration of activist groups that continues to this day.
I'm assuming I'm talking to a really smart five year old.
In a nutshell: America is far more right wing today because of COINTELPRO. </TEXT>

It's called the cult of scientism. Science and scientific method are great. Dogma is not. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Kaczynski drew much of his philosophy from Ellul and in particular the book I posted called Technological Society. In fact they had a long correspondence where the one thing they disagreed about was the use of violence. Check it out, you might find it interesting even though it was originally written in the 50's! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Cool. I think you essentially have the idea. It's about human beings becoming more purposeful with their use of technology, taking the reigns back and not just having blind faith in technological systems. Technology certainly can save us, but we have to cultivate the wisdom to use it better than we do at present. Hope you find it interesting. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm for non-violence but not necessarily peace. Creative non-violence was a powerful movement in the 70s and 80s. Collective civil disobedience can work wonders. Maybe one could argue that what we're seeing in Baltimore fits in with that. But when movements target the police or military, they're falling into a trap because those violent entities feed off of attempts at violence used against them. They love violence. Their budgets balloon, they get to seize control, they get to fear monger the public. Any act of violence - as opposed to destruction of property that results in no harming of human beings - any attempt at violent resistance will be fuel to the fire of these authoritarian forces.
Resistance needs to be smart and sustainable, but it probably shouldn't obsess over being peaceful. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks for posting that. Great video. That mirrors what I've gone through the last few years. Everything we discuss on this sub basically boils down to a war we're all in over human consciousness. The way to win the war is to reclaim your own mind and trust that others will follow this act of sanity.  </TEXT>
