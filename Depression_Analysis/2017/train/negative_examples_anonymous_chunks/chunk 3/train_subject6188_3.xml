	<TEXT> What is [Ultra Seven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultra_Seven) you say?

"Ultra Seven ( Urutora Sebun) is a tokusatsu science fiction TV series that aired on Japanese TV in 1967. Created by Eiji Tsuburaya, this follow up to Ultraman went on to become one of Japan's greatest fantasy TV series. Such is his popularity that Ultra Seven (or simply "Seven") has appeared or at least made cameos in nearly every Ultra Series following his own and has had far more exposure than even the original Ultraman (though the original Ultraman is without a doubt the face of the Ultras).
Ultra Seven is sometimes incorrectly called "Ultraman Seven" by many sources outside Japan (or in the case of KHON/Honolulu, Hawaii, Ultra 7, as listed in TV Guide when it ran in 1975). Both the series and its hero can also be called Ultraseven (without a space), which is generally the form used when romanized." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What is Tanabata?

"Tanabata is a Japanese festival originating from the Chinese Qixi Festival. It celebrates the meeting of the deities Orihime and Hikoboshi (represented by the stars Vega and Altair respectively). According to legend, the Milky Way separates these lovers, and they are allowed to meet only once a year on the seventh day of the seventh lunar month of the lunisolar calendar."

It's not a national holiday, so people still have to work and it's more popular with the kids, but many places have festivals and that means food, beer and games. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> It's 7/7 in Japan and that means it's Tanabata (, meaning "Evening of the seventh"), also known as the Star Festival! </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Due to the fact that /r/train_subject6188 is now the fastest growing sub ~~in my mind~~ on Reddit, we've had to take on two new moderators in /r/Handicapreader and /u/Carmabound.

Mr. Reader has created the sky above and below us, because, well, I was drunk and/or hungover every day in high school and wasn't paying attention to my teacher in computer class. All things CSS will go through him and only him. He deserves all the credit for everything you see.

Ms. Bound will be in charge of....in charge of....well, she'll be doing the same thing I do, and that's nothing but making witty comments and having lots of pun.

I'm sure after a few months, the crew will stage a mutiny and boot me off my own sub, but lets enjoy it while it lasts, ok?

	<TEXT> It's such an awesome team, Kane, Toews, Sharp(will he stay?), Keith, Shaw, Seabrook, Hossa and so on...

I was real saad to see Saad leave, but that's just the economics these days.

That said,the best move that Rocky made was pinching the Bowman's from Detroit. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  That's great :)

It is and it isn't. You know me, I'm such a worry-wart that I'm wondering what will go wrong, instead of enjoying it for what it is.

 Do you already have a place to stay

Yes, I'm just waiting for the realtor to confirm the exact move in date before I buy a ticket. I know it's a holiday weekend and all, but they're kinda laid back when it comes to all things business in HI.

 and a possible job lined up

No. Will have to get on this, but I went through this before when I went from Japan to Hawaii. People don't really want to talk to you unless you're there. Maybe because so many people change their minds at the last minute, but it's next to impossible to set something up via phone/internet.

 Do you have a laptop, or are you going to disconnect again?

I do, but I'm not sure what they have there. I may be offline for a week or so, but I'll try to set something up before I go, when the actual move in date is set for sure.

	<TEXT> As an American living in Tokyo, I'm just happy that I don't have to hear the locals gloat for the next four years.

Team Japan is pretty darn good though, and they do work really hard. It's just that the media coverage here is enough to drive anyone mad, unless of course your a fan of the team.

That said, ~~Brazil~~ Russia is only 2 years away, so I'm sure from tomorrow we'll be seeing how the men's Cup will coming to JP for sure!

**EDIT: Thanks to /u/tokomini for pointed out my brainfart. The Olympics will be held in Brazil in 2016, the WC was held there in 2014.** </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Carma, it's looking pretty good at the moment.

I've got to check back in with the doc next Mon, but other than buying a plane ticket and doing some last minute shopping, I'm pretty much 99.9% sure I'll be off next month.

Strangely enough, right around my cakeday again!

Unless the doc tells me that my body is seriously fucked, it's looking like I'll be basking in the sun soon enough:~) </TEXT>

Same crew must've done the roads here, 'cause that's pretty much how Tokyo is too:~( </TEXT>
