	<TEXT> I think /u/powerlanguage is the responsible for this experiment, but the explanation you need about the button is much more elaborated.

Sigh... Long story short: There is a button at the top of r/thebutton. Only people with Reddit accounts created before 1 of April can press it. You can press it only once. When you press it, you are assigned a colour depending on at what time did you press it. People are giving these colours religious/mythical/ideological meanings.

Everytime somebody presses it, it restarts from 60s. It has never got to 0.

The button looks like this: http://i.imgur.com/Mpi2qdN.gif

Just read a bunch of threads. It's actually very funny and you'll get the story very quickly. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have this problem too. I can't have an orgasm while having sex with a girl. I have to masturbate. When in home, watching porn and masturbating, there is no problem. But this seriously makes my relationships very awkward and frustrating. I lost my libido. I used to be obssesed about sex, but since I take my medication, I totally forgot about sex. I rarely masturbate.

I quit with some of my medication, antipsychotics to be precise (paliperidone, I think) and I have recovered some of the libido. Now I masturbate more regularly. I haven't been with a girl since I quit the pills, though, so I don't know if I'm still fixed. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have a music blog where I share and review albums. I'm still not very good or professional with the reviews but these are some things I've learned:

-Listen the album at least two or three times before you form and opinion.

-Write about the artist/band origins and story.

-Tell some interesting details/trivia about the album, the artists, some story behind them. For example, I'm very interested when some of the members of the band died or commited suicide. I don't know. I'm just like that, interested in morbid details.

-Have in mind the album's historic relevance, how important or influent it was for other artists at the moment of its realease. Maybe you'd listen Black Sabbath or Venom and find it bland compared to other contemporary albums, but at the moment they were pioneers, the first of it kind doing that thing.

-Explain how the music makes you feel. Its flavour. Its texture. Make metaphors.

-Read other reviews in famous sites like Pitchfork, Rate Your Music, etc, but also in less known blogs or Youtube channels.

I hope this helps you. </TEXT>

"You, sir, are a killer", she said, in a very convinced and funny tone.
"What?"
"You, sir, are a killer", she repeated.
"I'm sorry, but I have no idea what you are talking about".
"Well. You will find it tomorrow then".

She hanged up.

I'm 34 now and still have no idea what was that about or who she was.

Now that I think it, maybe I should even tell this in its own thread. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Don't worry. You are not a bad person or a pedophile just for having those thoughts, that seem just intrusive thoughts caused by your OCD.

Imagination is free. Mind is free. Just thinking about something doesn't mean you are gonna do it or you agree with it, specially with thoughts that you can't control.

Indulge yourself. Imagine whatever you want. You are free. Your mind can't hurt anybody. Your actions do. Don't be scare for your thoughts. That's just your mind trying to fuck you.

I've had problems like yours. Sometimes I see little children and imagine raping them. But I know I'm in no way attracted to them. I would never do anything inappropiate to a kid. I know that's just my mind looking for another way to make me feel bad, like when I imagine accidents or think again and again about that person that insulted me on the street.

Have a conversation with yourself and make things clear. Take a decision about your feelings and grasp to it whenever you feel insecure about these thoughts.

I hope some of this help you. </TEXT>
