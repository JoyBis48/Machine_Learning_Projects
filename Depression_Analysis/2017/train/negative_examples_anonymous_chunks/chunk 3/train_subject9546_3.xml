And once again let me say that you chose to read this post even though you knew going in you were going to be negative about it.  And you offered no criticism other than saying you hate how people make these posts.  Instead you could have just kept your mouth shut and commented on other posts that are on the sub that "fit the mold" of what you think should be posted here. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> May 19th is Kane Day.  There was a storyline years ago about how something horrible happened to him on May 19th and there was this presence that kept reminding him of it.  An imposter Kane showed up mask and all and the whole thing culminated in Kane throwing the imposter out of the building and taking the mask.  Then nothing happened with it.  Decent build but horrible outcome.  

P.S. The imposter Kane was played by Festus/Luke Gallows/Doc </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The closest thing I can think of is not so much doing it before hand but having to do it because they were locked in it and couldn't get out.  This was Bobby Lashley in the Extreme Elimination Chamber at December to Dismember </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The first one, only because it was so innovative and it saw the Return of Shawn Michaels.  Also I have to give the runner up to the Extreme Elimination Chamber at December to Dismember because it was the first time with the whole weapons in the chamber pods thing. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Woods is a tag champ right now, so no go on him.  Neville is feuding with Bo Dallas, Stardust is seemingly on his way to going back to Cody, Harper is back to teaming with Rowan so they will probably find a way to be in the chamber. </TEXT>
