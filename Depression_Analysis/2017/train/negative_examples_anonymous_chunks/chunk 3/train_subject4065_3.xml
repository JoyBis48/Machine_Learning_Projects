	<TEXT> It's pretty easy for people to say "resign", but difficult to do.

It sounds like your boss is aware of your position on this, make sure that others are as well. Leaders in the organization need to understand the impact (potential consequences) of the strategy, and ideally know that you are not a proponent of it, though still see you as a team player since you are moving forward with it per instructions.

You may have to work around your boss to achieve the above, but the greater good is the organization and not your boss' ego. Help your boss understand that your concern is the success of the business, and it isn't anything personal. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Buying statues for decor. Where? </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'd love a statue (specifically looking for one of Thoth) for my home, but what I've been able to find online are generally very small (a few inches) or just outrageously priced (IMHO).

Do you know of any places online where you can buy ~4' (feet) statues? Wood is fine with me, not looking for marble or anything like that.

Thanks.

	<DATE> 2013-06-19 03:19:28 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I've searched around but not finding much that really helps explain what someone who contacted me is trying to do, at least in a way that I understand. 

I am selling my condo and I got a call from an investment company (supposedly at least) saying they were interested in my property. She asked if we were to come to an agreed upon selling price if I would be willing to have them take on the mortgage payments. 

I told them I didn't understand what they were trying to do and would need more information, and she said she would arrange for the investor to contact me (I got the investor's name and she works at a local university, so I'm not sure how legit this is if she still holds a "regular" job). 

Any idea what this is? Sounds like bad news to me, but I'm not a mortgage expert.  </TEXT>

This is the Internet, even better it's Reddit. Let's not take it too seriously. 

As someone who has met Pween, he's a nice guy. Many others would have told the homeless guy to F off, but Pween shared what he had with him. Let's not vilify someone we share a community with for crap on Reddit.  </TEXT>

On one occasion someone said that it's due to equipment on the street and that it would be upgraded, but that was 3 years ago...

	<TEXT> Hi all,

I own a condo and am going through a divorce. I have an ok amount of equity in the condo, so what I'd like to do is sell it in order to pay my ex a lump sum which would reduce the amount of alimony I pay per month.

My understanding is if I sell the condo I'll take a big tax hit unless I put that money back into a place to live. Is there some work-around where if you sell property but the money goes to alimony you don't take that hit?

I appreciate any help.

I need help from an accountant ASAP. I am now going through a divorce and need to know the best way to go with finances/alimony. I need info asap as my soon-to-be-ex wants to move quickly. I'm not asking for a hand-out, I'll pay the person, but really need 30-60 minutes of a professionals time as early as possible. Monday or Tuesday afternoon would be ideal.

	<TITLE> Just berated by Ebay customer support </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-05-07 18:41:37 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I wish I recorded the conversation as it was hilariously bad. I purchased a cell phone and 5 days later still no communication from the seller (I've been emailing through ebay asking for updates), so I opened a case and called their "support" department to attempt to move the escalation date up -- since the seller hasn't communicated in 5 days I don't see the point in giving him 7 more days, which the case provides.

Anyway, the conversation with the "Manager" quickly escalated to him telling me "you're new to ebay, you don't know how it works" when I've been a member since 2001. He then berated me for not having much feedback "you only have 6 feedback, you don't know how this works". His tone was very much like bad parenting.

I have to admit I was laughing on the inside, but certainly not going to be using ebay again when you call for help from a non-responsive seller (I used paypal) and they literally make fun of you on the phone.

At the end I recommended customer service training for him, he didn't seem to like that. </TEXT>
