	<TEXT> Ive said it before, I'll say it again: Mike Miller is going to be huge these first two games. He'll spread the floor offensively and he can guard Mirotic or Dunleavy. I know his shot has been off when he's played this season, but he is a playoff performer. Look out for MikeMillMadeIt come Monday </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Am a white kid from Texas who didn't have the daddy money to buy a car with. Can confirm. Nobody actually cared about anything if it didnt have to do with them. The reason I listen to the kind of rap that actually says something about life is bc i have no clue what that life is like. I actually wrote a paper about it this semester, and I just basically like seeing life from different perspectives and trying to understand from a distance what people are going through bc i have no idea what that life is like. 
Anyway, I'd like to apologize for the jackasses who didnt give a shit. All us white kids aren't like that, I promise.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I dont want this theory to hinge on Bruce pulling something Batman-ish out of his ass. I think Nolan showed Selina Kyle in that scene just to mess with the audience and make us question everything we just saw, exactly like the end of Inception. I just find it extremely hard to believe that Bruce either got the bomb out far enough from the city and somehow escaped the blast radius himself in that small amount of time, or used the auto pilot to take the bomb out which would mean that everything we see of him in the aircraft is fake. Just doesnt make sense. Makes a lot more sense for him to sacrifice himself to protect the city he has dedicated his life to protect and for Nolan to throw Bruce and Selina in that last scene just to fuck with us. For me, that was Alfred seeing what he always wished he would see every time he went there. Completely in his head.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Mike Miller is the X factor in our playoff run from here on out. I saw it in Miami, I see it now. If he can hit 3's like he has in playoffs of old and if he can defend like he has in the past, he's a game changer. He is a guy who has been through it all before with Lebron and knows where he needs to be at critical points in a game. He's 6 foot 8 so he can guard some 4's who tend to stay outside (mirotic, for example) and he can rebound the ball too. If Blatt actually plays him, he can genuinely affect games.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> More optimistic about our chances in the East? Absolutely! At winning a title? Not so much. If Kevin indeed tore his labrum and has tendon damage, he might not be back at all. Especially since he would be banging that shoulder in the post all game. and ESPECIALLY since he can be a free agent. I just don't know if we can beat, say the warriors, without him. If he can play (and chooses to) i 100% think we can win it all. but he has to play </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Mike Mill is gettin pt this series. Lebron knows who he is in the playoffs (game 5 in '12, 7 3's, shoeless 3 against the spurs) and he's is gonna make sure he plays. The only issue i see is our starting lineup. we have to match pau and noah so tt and moz have to start. cant spread the floor with that. so we have to wait for the bulls to put a smaller guy in before we can have a lineup that suits our strengths. in other words, we cant make the first move. we'll be adjusting to what they do instead of the other way around. still think we got em tho </TEXT>

I think we'll see a lot of Mike Miller next series and a lot more post up Lebron. I'm not worried about this series honestly because we have all the pieces to win. If guys like James Jones, Mike Miller, Kyrie, And Shump all hit shots, we'll be fine. Plus, I don't trust DRose to do anything </TEXT>

	<TEXT> basketball reference.com. literally showed it on screen during the game. in the NBA, when a dislocated shoulder is listed as the cause of injury to a player, the average number of games missed is 27 games. However, I am not saying Kevin will be out for 27 games. I am saying that, on average, that's how many games are missed by players during the regular season. and yes, if there's no ligament or tendon damage then of course it wont be that long.  </TEXT>
