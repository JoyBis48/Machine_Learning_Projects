	<TEXT> I was thinking this same thing recently, and came to the conclusion that we need both subconscious and conscious control of our breathing or we would quickly die. 

for example, if we always had only conscious control of our breathing, we would die as soon as we fell asleep. 

and if it was only unconsciously controlled, we wouldn't be able to hold our breath, like if we were underwater, our body would be in control and continue to try and breathe.

	<TEXT> Some people are over weight due to medical reasons, illnesses, medications, syndromes can cause sudden rapid weight gain. 

my cousin gained a lot of weight recently and was diagnosed with PCOS, she had been skinny her whole life to that point and the weight gain caused her to develop severe depression,  which she is now medicated for, side effect of the medication is weight gain.  

She is overweight,  but shouldn't be shamed.  If you shame all fat people,  you're also shaming people who honestly have very little control over their weight.  She's losing weight but it takes a hell of a lot longer and is a hell of a lot harder to lose it than gain it.  

But also, shaming people isn't going to change them,  or help them, it just makes them feel awful.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> throughout my teen years I didn't care about germs at all, I hardly ever washed my hands, even after touching things like bus seats, covered in all kinds of gross. I would get mildly sick about once every 18 or so months and only for a day or two.

since I've started to wash my hands regularly and I'm not going out in public as often, I get sick every few months. 

so, exposure to 'germs' plays a part in building a strong immune system.  </TEXT>
