	<TEXT>  You're not getting my point. I never said you were wrong, I said you were too biased.

That's like saying "I didn't call you an asshole, I said you were an anus."  The ignorance is in this weird and phony historic-isms to manufacture neutral meaning for a racist symbol.  It's like arguing the swastika is just a benign Sanskrit good luck symbol.

	<TEXT> In 2001 I celebrated 15 years of continuous sobriety, but I felt as you are expressing in this post.  I felt like I had accomplished alot; I was sponsoring; professionally, I was doing the best work of my life and not enjoying the financial rewards that I felt like I was due; I was frequently enraged; and, finally, I relapsed.  The relapse miraculously ended in 2009. My [story is fairly well documented in the Saturday Share](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/25u6cc/saturday_share_im_train_subject1576_and_i_am_an_alcoholic/) so I won't repeat it here.  My lesson: give TIME, TIME.  They like to say in AA: "don't leave the room before the miracle occurs."  This advice in my experience is totally true.  It's harder, much harder to come back and dig out of the damage--but, miracles of change in the human experience happen around us all the time, and if we're patient, within, too. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is probably going to shock my friends on SD, but yes I believe that there are some people for whom controlled drinking works; but, I'm not that person.  Not only, am I not that person, I can't even get in the head of someone who would think controlled drinking is a good thing, although at one time I thought it would be nice to drink just fine wines--when I was in my pre-relapse home cooking phase and watching Food TV in the day when they had real cooking shows with teaching chefs.  The reality is that after 15 continuous years of sobriety my "controlled drinking" spun wildly out of control after about 2 weeks and then it took me 7 long hellish years to get back to recovery.  I have fully answered the question for myself--why would I want to?  I only ever wanted that elusive sensation that I got from drinking (or so I told myself) and after I relapsed, I discovered to my satisfaction that all I really ever could do was drink myself into stupor.  </TEXT>

I love AA and AA meetings, but over time--not drinking, actively listening, I learned who I should listen to, and who I could discount.  Believe it or not, after awhile, people I discounted started to make a bit more sense.  Funny, that. </TEXT>

I'm gonna kneel and pray every day last I should become vain along the way

I'm just an old chunk of coal now Lord but I'm gonna be a diamond some day


I'm gonna learn the best way to walk gonna search and find a better way to talk

I'm gonna spit and polish my old rough edged self till I get rid of every single flaw

I'm gonna be the world's best friend gonna go round shaking everybody's hand

I'm gonna be the cotton pickin' rage of the age I'm gonna be a diamond some day

	<TEXT>  I've gotta remember I am just not someone who can drink. I really really just can't.

I would turn this around, it's not about what I "can't do" (being an alcoholic a "can't do" is usually just a challenge "to do something I shouldn't); nope, what I CHOOSE to do is not drink TODAY, only.  I don't 'quit drinking" instead I make a renewable daily decision not to drink TODAY, only, no matter what happens good or bad.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Last night, my alcoholic brain started convincing me to drink and that death is a good reason to drink. That is when I knew I was in the danger zone today.

The alkie brain is a big fucking liar.  

I'd cling to AA meetings and my support network.  I'd jump on the [SD Chat](http://is.gd/rsdirc) and get real time support.   </TEXT>
