	<TEXT> I agree. I know we all just want to see Godzilla fight monsters, but everyone knows that the best Godzilla movies are for the most part just about humans vs Godzilla. Except the 1998 American version of course but that's for a whole bunch of other reasons.

Plus we already saw massive monster fights in Pacific Rim. Seeing people getting reports of Godzilla encounters out in the ocean or on islands, slowly discovering that this mind blowing beast somehow exists and the ramifications of such a thing, and then seeing it destroy human civilization while soldiers try hopelessly to hold him back would be awesome and scary and intense and something we've never seen done properly before. Once he gets to fighting other monsters it gets a bit more fun and silly. I kinda wish they had saved the other monsters for the sequels. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Just for comparison with other similar and recent destruction filled disaster/monster movies;


Pacific Rim's budget was $190M (A lot more than I had thought)

King Kong (2005) was $207M

Transformers 1 was $150M

Transformers 2 was $200M

Transformers 3 was $190M

Man of Steel was $225M

2012 was $200M

Cloverfield was $25M

Battle: Los Angeles was $75M

Battleship was $209M

GI Joe: Rise of Cobra was $175M

Armageddon was $140M

D-War was $75M (Most expensive Korean film of all time) 

Godzilla (1998) was $130M

Final Wars was $19M (The biggest budget ever for a Japanese Godzilla movie)

And Gareth Edward's Monsters was half a million bucks; $500,000

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm not sure what the exact budget for this movie will end up being, nor do I know if Gareth Edwards is experienced enough to truly create a disaster movie of this scale, but this movie really needs to turn entire cities into radioactive wastelands.
So far the poster, interviews with the creators, and the Comic-Con teaser (which I haven't actually seen) seem to be hinting at exactly this, but I'm still not convinced. The problem is, again, I think the budget for this movie is a lot smaller than most disaster films, and Gareth isn't exactly experienced in epic large scale apocalyptic disaster films. Although he is talented and certainly knows how to stretch a budget

Pacific Rim was okay for what it was, but didn't deliver as much as I had hoped in the destruction department. After how disappointingly careful and harmless the 1998 Zilla was, bafflingly so for a Roland Emmerich film, and after seeing all the destruction based marketing so far, we really need a movie that makes Man of Steel and Transformers look tame in comparison.

If they want to set themselves apart, and deliver a truly terrifying and realistic and worthwhile reimagining of Godzilla, then they need to blow people's minds by showing off what a giant angry living nuclear battleship loose in a major city can do in a way no one has ever seen before.

I mean, surely if something as large as Godzilla were to actually exist, he'd do a lot more damage just walking around than just cracking the cement and smacking down buildings. He'd be a moving earthquake generator, and each footstep would permanently destroy the earth beneath him. 

Gareth and the writers/producers certainly seem to have a deep love for the original film, and the cast is absolutely superb, I just really hope they can use CG and modern Hollywood effects to take the wanton destruction and carnage of the Japanese films, and crank it up to 11. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not bad. Bit too much background noise going on for me though. I really hope they do a new version of the classic theme for this movie. Big and orchestral and epic. Based on how many references to the original there have already been already I'm sure they will.

I'm pretty disappointed that Michael Giacchino isn't doing the score. If you listen to the theme he made for Cloverfield you'll see that he would have been perfect. </TEXT>

Also I really don't like the look of his face. I get that they don't want him to look like Mel Gibson or Tom Hardy and are going for their own take on the character, but he just looks strange.

But hey, Just Cause 2 was stupid and weird and poorly acted and that was still some of the most fun I've had in a video game in a long long time. </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2013-07-13 04:22:41 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> One of my favorite new features in BOGT was that after every story mission you were graded on your performance, and given stats about your accuracy, time, headshots, things like that, and then you could replay any story mission you wanted at any time to try to get better.

Imagine how much it would suck to play through an amazing mind blowing heist sequence, and then not be able to do it again. Especially now that you can upgrade your weapons and gear and personal stats, or replay it again but switching to different characters at different times. 

I don't remember for sure, but I'm pretty sure while replaying a mission in BOGT you don't earn any extra money or anything, so no need to worry about people replaying heists for bonus cash or stat upgrades.

Sure, replaying the whole game can be fun, but if you just want to replay a specific mission or show off a cool sequence to a friend, or replay a certain heist to try to get better at it, you don't want to replay the whole game and lose all your progress in the story and side missions, as well as your money and weapons and possessions. There's already a pretty much perfect mission replaying system in BOGT that they could hopefully use in GTA 5. It only adds tonnes more replay value to an already jam packed game. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The first one is a brilliant and fun and hilarious cheesy old school action adventure movie. Honestly, I think reinventing a classic Universal horror icon in the style of a classic pulp adventure serial was a perfect idea. It felt like Doc Savage Meets The Mummy. It was going for the same tone and tongue in cheek reference-filled style as Indiana Jones, and I think it nailed it. It was purposely campy and self aware, but without being too goofy or jokey. I'm not the biggest fan of Brendan Fraser, but he was great, the movie was fun, great special effects, and some genuinely creepy moments. Not a masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination, but I absolutely loved it, and still do. Very much an under appreciated movie.


The second one sucked though. It's a shame that Stephen Sommers seemingly lost his self-aware campy style after this movie and went all ridiculous and terrible. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When it comes to just Godzilla movies, my personal favourites are

Godzilla (1954)

Destroy All Monsters (1968)

Godzilla - or Return of Godzilla (1984)

Godzilla vs Biollante (1989)

Godzilla vs MechaGodzilla 2 (1993)

Godzilla vs Desotroyah (1995)

Godzilla 2000 (2000)

Godzilla: Giant Monsters All Out Attack (2001)

Godzila Final Wars (2004)

I think these have the most action, most interesting Kaiju, and are just the most fun to watch. Some Godzilla movies can be super cheap and light on the Kaiju action, or just plain strange. These are all fairly simple and accessible.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I feel like the gameplay trailer that's coming soon will probably be a part of the multiplayer reveal. I can't imagine Rockstar showing gameplay of the campaign before release, and since they're doing this new GTA Online thing, I think it makes sense that they'd release a gameplay video of how it all works. Maybe in the style of those RDR and Max Payne videos. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The missed punches don't show how overmatched Batman is when Bane is still reacting to the hit. Not once during the fight did I think "wow Batman is out of his league!" or "whoa Batman is finally outmatched!" I could only think "Yikes this is poorly done."

There's a big difference between being deliberately choreographed in a sloppy messy fashion to portray the characters in a certain way, and plain bad choreography where punches miss clearly by inches and the other fighter acts like he got hit,  unrealistic moves, people swing their arms nowhere near an opponent just so the other fighter can block it, obviously awkward positioning, and Bane doing a sloppy little jump spin in the middle of a fight and Batman just sort of waits to get hit.

The negative things I said about that fight weren't the point of the fight, they weren't choices by Nolan or the choreographer. They were mistakes and sloppy filmmaking and poor stunt work.

	<TEXT> Everyone was talking about how epic and brutal the first Bane vs Batman fight was. I heard 'amazing' and 'breathtaking' a few times before seeing the movie. The lead up was basically Batman saying,  "Take me to this movie's villain so we can have a fight scene." Then there's a weird awkwardly paced build up, before Bane and Batman finally clash in a pretty averagely choreographed slow fight with lots of missed punches and cheesy moments. I usually really like Nolan movies but his fight scenes are always terrible, and DKR was one of his weakest films by far. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Roland's last movie 2012 was like that as well. It was so tonally inconsistent that it really drove me crazy. 

There's a scene where a man tries to make up with his son over the phone after not speaking to him for years. Right as the son picks up the phone a huge earthquake hits and the father listens to his son die. Then, as the old man cries, a giant tidal wave comes and kills him and like a thousand other people. Then there's a giraffe hanging from a helicopter and John Cusack's daughter says she doesn't pee her pants anymore. 

Also, a scene where a chihuahua walks across a tightrope while a wife angrily gives her husband the finger, all to goofy cartoony music, and then the husband falls to his death while his children watch and scream.

That movie was fucking weird   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Both consoles have 8GB of RAM, but the Xbox One OS takes up 3 GB, and the PS4's OS takes up 1. So PS4 has 7GB of Ram devoted to games and Xbox One only has 5. Also PS4 uses GDDR 5 and Xbox One uses GDDR 3. Plus, PS4 is cheaper, has better exclusives, support for indie developers, no online passes, and PS Plus gives you free games every month. It's still all around a cheaper and more powerful machine.

EDIT: And a 50% more powerful GPU </TEXT>
