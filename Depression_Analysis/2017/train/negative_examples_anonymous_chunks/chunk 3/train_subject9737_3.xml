	<TEXT> My grandfather has Alzheimer's and sometimes I have to take care of him. I am 22 and my 76 year old Grandpop makes me so scarred to grow up, get old, and totally become a baby again. Helping him get undressed, eat, or even to get him outta bed is like having a gray-haired toddler who thinks he's the boss. Gotta love him, though! 
Sometimes, I get these scary visions of when my mom, future SO, or even myself will get like this and it just reminds me how scary time is.  </TEXT>
