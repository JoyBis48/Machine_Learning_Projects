	<TEXT> My friend had to explain to his teacher that his dog actually DID eat his homework. He even brought a note from home. 

It read: 'Last Thursday night as Sam was sitting down to start his art home work, he found that our dog had someone gained access to his school bag and obliterated most of his work.

Signed X' </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Kevin at our school lived on a farm. On his last day he arrived in a 4x4 with 3 live pigs in the back. One had the number '1' painted on the back the other two pigs had '2' and '4' on theirs. 

He let them loose around school. There was much confusion as to where the 3rd pig was.  </TEXT>
