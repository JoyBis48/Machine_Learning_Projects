	<TITLE> TIL A 24 megaton hydrogen bomb almost detonated over North Carolina when the B-52 bomber carrying it broke up. 3 out of 4 of its safety switches failed, its parachute opened, its trigger mechanisms engaged, and only one low-voltage switch prevented it from detonating. </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Is there any way to change the audio output of chrome and or mute all audio in chrome? I feel like this feature is a given and would set Chrome apart from all other browsers.

I am not looking for any solutions involving changing the default system output. </TEXT>
