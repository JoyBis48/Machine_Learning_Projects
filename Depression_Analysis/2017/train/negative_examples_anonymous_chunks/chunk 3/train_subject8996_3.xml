We really don't have to reinvent the wheel. We have medicare and we can use that as our base. Just look at every other developed country. There's not that much mystery. Single payer would be better.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The markets of supermarkets and heatlhcare are very different! If I don't buy Safeway's overpriced  produce, I'm not going to die. I have many other options to buy groceries. I can even grow some food myself. Now, what happens if I need medical care? The inelastic demand curve says I have buy the product no matter how much everyone is going to rip me off. If there was medicare for everyone the government can bring down prices drastically just like every other country does. That is the power of a single provider.  </TEXT>
