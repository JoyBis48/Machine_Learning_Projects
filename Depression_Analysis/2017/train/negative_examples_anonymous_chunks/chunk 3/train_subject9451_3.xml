	<TEXT> There's a couple factors why I haven't carried cash in years. First of all, its inconvenient. Why should I waste my time, a cashier's time, and the time of others in line finding enough coin and bills to pay, when I can stick or tap a card at a device, and be out in under 15 seconds? Other factors are, my wallet doesn't have a change pocket, and neither do I feel like keeping change loose in my pockets. Also, cash is a liability. Most muggings do not end up in violence if you show your wallet has nothing but secure cards, at least where I'm from. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Its a matter of not knowing what you want. A story/example I had recently sums it up. A friend of mine wanted to make a gift basket for her friends birthday, so we went over to the liquer commission to find some wine. Well there's literally walls of wine in the place, from every corner of the world. She had no clue what she wanted, but I know a little bit from purchasing and making wine. Told the guy working there she wants something sweeter, with tones of bitter and dry. This guy had a suggestion almost immediately. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> One silence, one free fear, one fear that consumes shadow orbs. Hardly a lot of cc. Oh and a talent for roots or stationary fearing fiend if you walk near it. Granted I can drop it on your face, but its easy to get away from.

Its the warrior/druid cc monkeys that need to calm down.

I main a warlock as well, and while I agree cc is out of control, fears are literally my survivability. Not only am I losing most of this or its getting nerfed into the ground, I lose my only defensive cd as well. Warlocks are being gutted and it's why I probably won't pvp after 6.0 anymore, until Blizzard realizes they literally killed a class's viability.

Edit: grammer, spelling, priest content.

Edit 2: currently 1500 RBG rating, easily could have been 2.2k plus if I got along better with bad target callers. </TEXT>
