	<TEXT> Depends on the mood. If im super stoned I will listen to very laid back chillwave esc electronic. I am not unknown to listen to 80s RnB with friends and have the occasional dance party. Love me some 60s   70s classic rock. Huge Rush and Moody Blues fan. Classical music is also super cool. Steve Reich to Bruckner-its all awesome. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Me and some friends were lucky enough to be there for this when they filmed it. They played through the tune like 6 times and each time it got better. As a trumpet player, I was super impressed that their trumpeter had the chops to play like that 6+ times. They ended up playin us some other fun stuff at the end. These dudes are crazy good and super fun! Real deal </TEXT>

	<TEXT> smoking with friends outside makes me forget about the cold. We talk and its easy to not worry about weather and just focus on conversation. Otherwise, when I am alone, just dress warm, light my j and enjoy being with my thoughts. I did go to school where it averaged 0 degrees during the winter months so I have some training. Good luck! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> great soundtrack. This reminds me a lot of some Phillip Glass operas. Check out Satyagraha if you like the Interstellar score. 

Unrelated to Glass, Steve Reichs Music for 18 Musicians is phenomenal. You will certainly go places if you listen to that above a [4] </TEXT>
