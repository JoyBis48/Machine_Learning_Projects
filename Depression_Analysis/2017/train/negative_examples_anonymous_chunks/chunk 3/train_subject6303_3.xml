	<TEXT> Aw he did so good on his dates! As far as simulating at home - you may know this, but if you put them somewhere unfamiliar it is best (bathtub with a towel down works great). 

We had a lot of success with a nervous bun by opening the pen door and sitting on the ground and letting her come to us - we also put her food in and out that way. She had the opposite problem (ran and hid), but it may be helpful for a little biter, too. 

And we don't have chickens - that video is actually in the shelter. They had roosters in there that day! 

Can't wait to hear/see more of Squishy! Hope everybun is settling in well. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Awesome. I was there the day he came in the shelter. (I volunteer with the Rabbit Haven)

Enjoy a video of him being "aggressive" to me in the shelter! 
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq8Ac2nAXJA feature=c4-overview list=UUszCsrsauaGtBORGmKIeS2g

I am so happy he found a home. I heard from a volunteer who was at the show that day that he loved his new family instantly and it was a very good match - so congratulations and enjoy this little puff ball! =:)

And please keep posting pics! Seeing the buns happy in their new homes is one of the best things for a shelter volunteer! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As someone who works with a rescue, and as a shelter volunteer, I beg you not to have baby bunnies. Our rescue has taken in so many litters born to unspayed female rabbits in the shelter that need a foster home to go to. There are also babies found dumped by breeders who can't get rid of them. There are so many ways to bring baby rabbits into your home without contributing to the problem and taking away homes from rabbits that already exist. 

Get in touch with a local rescue or shelter and let them know you are interested in raising a litter. When they were grown the rescue would be helping you find them good homes - and they usually give you first priority if you want to adopt any. 

Just my 2 cents. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Female rabbits who aren't spayed have an 80%+ chance of getting uterine cancer before they are 3 years old. Definitely get her spayed. (As abyssurr already said) Plus all the behavioral benefits. 7 months is old enough. 6 months is old enough. She will be fine :)

As far as other ideas - everyone is saying vinegar for cleaning and that is great. The other thing you can do is to put litter boxes there. They will be in the way, yes, but if you fill the area with litter boxes and there is no way to pee there without peeing in them - maybe she will get the point. It helped with a lot of problem areas for us. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks!

It has an opening so I suppose it could have been done any time. We don't have any vet records for her. She was a stray found in a field and I took her home from the shelter.

 I need to take her in to a bird vet to get her checked out and make sure she is okay. A vet might have more info for us.

We have no idea how old she is. We don't actually know if she is a she but we named her Leela, so we call her she. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My conure was in the back of the shelter in the rabbit room I volunteer in. The shelter has no bird facilities and doesn't even adopt birds out of there. Because I am a volunteer with a rescue I was able to rescue her under the rabbit rescue's name and take her home. She already had a band on her ankle. 

Where would she have had this band put on? What do the numbers and letters mean?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes I pre-made all the meals and labelled "Saturday AM" "Saturday PM"

We changed the litter before we left and the day we got back (Friday, Sunday)... so we didn't worry about that. 

I would make sure they know to refill the hay box if it is empty. 

I have heard some people say their pets, rabbits included, like when the tv or radio is left on for them - that it helps them not be lonely. Perhaps your parents could turn something on during the day?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Rabbits are extremely clean! They clean themselves constantly and if kept in a clean environment are not smelly or dirty. 

Their breath smells good, they don't have a "smell" like dogs do, and you don't have to wash them.

The only thing "dirty" about our rabbits is that there is now hay everywhere in our house. Hay isn't really dirty... so I would say your roomates are crazy.

Also, as the other commenter said, they aren't rodents.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We just left our buns for 2 days. We have three of them and they range from slightly under a year to 3.5 years. We also have a bird. My parents came by twice a day to feed everyone and talk to them and give them treats - make sure they are pooping and not looking ill. 

They live in x pens set up to make a 4x4 area for each so they aren't cramped, but they are used to being let out everyday. They were thrilled to see us when we got home and did not seem angry. 

I recommend leaving a note with instructions to your sitter. This is what ours looked like:

Rabbits:
Change water
Fill hay racks - hay in large green bins
Fill food bowls - food labelled in tupperware in fridge
If it is very hot - put frozen water bottles from freezer in their cage for them to lay against. You can also turn on the wall AC in the room if you close the sliding kitchen door and come by later to turn the AC off.
Pet their heads and say some nice words to them
Check for any emergency situations. Rabbits can die within 24 hours of contracting some conditions. Emergency vet information is below. 

Emergencies: (none SHOULD happen, but just in case, these are immediate vet situations)
Heat Stroke - runny nose, listless, hot ears. Cool water (not ice) on ears and get to vet.
Respiratory Issues - gasping for air, runny nose, stretching neck out to breathe.
Back, leg, or neck injury - Dragging a limb, inability to put weight on limb, dragging butt
Bloody wounds, eye injuries, or electric shock from chewing a cord
GI Stasis - not eating, no feces
Runny or liquid feces
Head tilt
Loud tooth grinding is a sign of pain

We left a carrier by the back door just in case you need it
