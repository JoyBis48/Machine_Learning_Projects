	<TEXT> What I posted in the r/books thread: 

 I like ASOIAF and a lot of other things mentioned here, but honestly this feels like an article that's written every 5 years. "Is Game of Thrones the triumph of fantasy?" "Is Harry Potter the triumph of fantasy?" "Is Peter Jackson's LOTR the triumph of fantasy?" "Is Terry Pratchett being the best-selling UK author in the 90s the triumph of fantasy?" etc.

 Basically, there's always one or two fantasy books/TV shows/films that break out into the mainstream every couple years. That's been true for a loooong time. But the genre itself never provides a lot of popular products at the same time.

 I even specifically remember a lot of "Fantasy has taken over YA for good!" articles during Harry Potter/His Dark Materials, but then like 5 years later it was all dystopian SF (Hunger Games/Divergent/etc.) and now it's dominated by sappy realism ala John Green and Rainbow Rowell. Basically, cycles move quickly.

Fantasy has been considered pretty legitimate for a while now in the literary world. Not sure there is much new in 2015 other than one popular TV show.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes, it's nonsense. The problems with all of these articles is that the numbers are just basically made up, because the actual numbers are all over the map. Trad publishing debuts can range anywhere from a mere 3k to 2 million in advances (there was a literary debut novel that got 2 million a couple years ago). Self-publishing authors mostly earn zero dollars, but those who do earn can range from 1 dollar a month to, who knows, 400k a month. 

Without knowing the work itself or the market you are looking at, there's no way to know what your potential money will be.

	<TEXT> Well, by that logic nothing should ever cost anything since some things are free. Youtube and so on are supported in part by ads though. 


 To me it just feels as if the pricing of audiobooks (and also books to a certain extent) is stuck in some kind of premium category of entertainment, while it today with everything being digital it is not really different from any other form of entertainment.

People say this on here a lot but I don't understand it. Books operate basically the exact same as other mediusm as far as I can tell. 

* You have Netflix for movies, and you have Oyster for books at same price. 

* You can pay 20 something for a DVD of a film or 15 for a CD of music and you can pay 15 or so for a paper book (more for fancy hardcover). 

* You can get a digital DVD/CD/ebook for a few bucks cheaper than the physical version. 

* You can watch some limited content free on YouTube, and there is tons of free fiction on web journals. 

All that said, an audiobook subscription service seems like a good idea. An audio counterpart to Netflix/Hulu/Oyster makes sense to me.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I can think of a couple recent mainstream adult novels that were anthropomorphic

* The Bees by Laline Paull (came out last year, about, well, bees)

* Albert of Adelaide by Howard L. Anderson (2012, about Australian animals)

I haven't read either so can't comment on the quality, but both were literary fiction published by big houses. Clearly an anthropomorphic novel CAN be sold. (As others note, it's even more common to find SF/F books with anthropomorphism.) I'm sure it is harder to sell, but on the other hand there are less people doing them

Why on earth do you think that future apps won't do this? 

There were news stories about a woman who rewrote Harry Potter to be about Christianity instead of wizards and witches, removing all the "evil" witchcraft. 

I could easily see future apps being designed to filter out ideas or to cut out portions of a novel that the app makers don't like. Say, The Jungle, which ends with a pro-socialist message. Surely some conservative would be down to read that book with the ending cut off, and a future app might oblige him.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would say the hallmark of bad writing is being boring. Most of the other stuff people say isn't true. By which I mean, there are great books without round characters, great books without plots, great books that are heavily stylized and/or with very little style, yada yada. Any of that kind of thing can be done as long as the work is interesting. 

A hallmark of mediocore writing is that it's not memorable, to me at least. So a book that's interesting superficially while reading, but which you never think about again isn't really "good" writing in my book. (for me most "airport fiction" / beach read books fall into that category).  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  My idea is "simple": after an author dies his books must be given for free in digital editions, while the physical copies must be sold at a price that covers the costs of the production, plus an income for the editors and all the work that is behind it. 

Isn't this basically how things already work except instead of "right at death" it happens after copyright runs out. Once that happens, Gutenberg and other places give it out for free digitally and cheap paperback companies like Dover Thrift sell paper books for like 1-3 bucks. 

Basically you just want a shorter copyright? 

 digital distribution doesn't have costs.. 

This really isn't true. But again, once copyright is finished places like Project Gutenberg make free digital copies.

 I'd like to know if my idea is in some way feasible

A post on reddit isn't going to change international copyright laws  </TEXT>

I agree that ebooks should be a few dollars cheaper than print books, but I think they basically always are. If the paper book cost less it's probably because Amazon or whatever site you were on discounted the paper book but not the ebook. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Okay, I didn't realize you were going off about DRM. A few things: 

- "authors" do NOT have the power to stop any shop selling their goods, unless they are self-publishers I guess. Authors sign contracts with publishers, who sign contracts with distributors, who sell to retailers. As I noted before, many authors wanted to pull books from Amazon during the recent Amazon fight but couldn't because they'd signed those rights away. 

- In general, I'm not a fan of DRM. But DRM is hardly unique to "authors." All digital products can, and frequently do, have DRM. Conversely, many publishers don't use DRM at all. 

 In other words, authors can stop their ebook from being sold by "White Power Books" for the same reason there is no such thing as a 'used ebook store'. 

Well, no. As I noted above, authors sign contracts. If you sign with a publisher who sells books to White Power Cafe or ebooks to WhitePowerCafe.com, you are shit out of luck really. All you can do is complain and ask for them to be pulled, but you can't legally make that happen.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Would it be bullying if the service in question was, say, a same-sex dating app and the media firestorm was from the conservative press?

If someone developed an app that inserted Satanic references, gay marriage, and, what else do Christians hate these days?, global warming into Christian novels, and Christian authors got upset about it I would not say they were bullies. I mean, I think it would be pretty funny because gay marriage is cool and climate change is real, but conservative authors would be in their rights to say they don't want the app used on their books. 

 If you can change the names and none of the logic and up with a radically different conclusion, then maybe you should reconsider how honestly you've arrived at your opinions.

Haha, dude, whatever our disagreements here, your "change the names" example was COMPLETELY unrelated. Here Christian conservatives are attempting to change the words of artists and the artists are upset. That has nothing to do with a same-sex dating app that Christians hate because they are homophobic. 

No author is saying that all books should have profanity! No one is saying that Christian books shouldn't be allowed to exist! </TEXT>

Look, there are one million books published a year. There is a near infinite back catalog of books published in human history. You don't like a book because of the language? Don't buy it! Buy any of the millions of books that don't use those words. You're "rights" are not being infringed that a book exists with words you don't like!

	<TEXT>  The fact is that bread companies don't have the power to stop any shop from selling their goods. This is because bread companies don't have monopoly rights on their bread.

What on earth are you talking about? 

A bread company absolutely has the same rights as an author/publisher. They can enter into contracts with retail shops, or they can not. 

I seriously don't understand what you think is going on with books? What's different? 

p.s. authors do NOT have the power to stop any shop from selling their goods, they have to honor the contracts they enter into. Many authors wanted to pull books from Amazon but couldn't because they signed contracts, for example.) 

 You would be a monopolist if you had the power to stop "White Power Cafe", but because you don't have that power you aren't a monopolist.

Again, authors do NOT have that power. Even in this case, it was authors complaining that got the Clean App to take them off. They didn't legally force the app to stop it. IF there was a legal basis for it to be stopped, it would be on some intellecutal property grounds that would apply to other goods as well!

You seem to be very confused about the situation here.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you have legitimate reasons to not read a book--such as actual PTSD, which is a real thing not just "feeling icky" at curse words--then you teacher will almost certainly give you some alternative. Teachers are normally pretty sensitive to that kind of thing. 

if you don't actually have any real pyschological need to avoid a book, but just don't want to see words like "penis" or "piss" then your teacher will likely roll their eyes at you. 

Again, I don't see what this has to do with Clean Reader. Trigger warnings are for things that can trigger PTSD. This app does not scrub out rape scenes or violent war scenes. It just changes curse words and some body part terms.  </TEXT>

The issue here is with a teacher FORCING you to read the book, not with the author writing the scene. 

I think trigger warnings and what literature can or should be taught in school is an interesting question, but it really doesn't have anything to do with this app (unless you are suggesting that seeing the word "piss" instead of "pee" could cause serious psychological damage...) </TEXT>

Sorry it's... totally fucking different on every single level. 

First off, this app sold ebooks through it. So authors wanted their books pulled from a store that was promoting religious censorship. 

Are you telling me that if I sold muffins and didn't want my muffins sold at a White Power cafe, that'd be a "monopolist"? 

Or if I was a rubber band maker and asked for my rubber bands not to be sold through a openly anti-gay office supply company that it would be "horrid" of me? 

Really? If I make rubber bands and don't want a company to stamp "fuck [some racial group" on them and sell them, then I can't tell them not to use my rubber bands without being some evil, "horrid" monopolist? I have a hard time believing you really think this.

Stoneheart is unexpected, surely, but she doesn't solve a problem. It's not like Ned Stark is the hero of ASOIAF and just when you think he can't possibly survive, Stoneheart revives and saves his life.

Look, no one in the industry takes the Author Earnings seriously. They fail basic statistics. 

But the above is really comical because fake reviews, purchased reviews, and scam reviews are RAMPANT in the self-publishing world. Of course they get hire reviews when the the reviews are all from friends, family, or people they paid to review! 

Beyond that, people who "review" a free or 99 cent ebook hold it to a lower standard than a 25 dollar hardcover. It's fair of them to do so, since they are paying way less, but they aren't reviewing the same thing in that case. 

 Also, I'll point out that the trads publish their share of crap (Twilight, 50 shades etc...)

But yes, of course it is low compared to traditional, for a very simple reason: numbers. 

There are something like ONE MILLION self-published books each year. Some of those are by bots and such, but the point is that there are vastly more self-published books than traditionally published books. Even if you believed there were as many good novels self-published as traditionally published, the self-published "good" ones are buried under an entire mountain of horrible ones. And there is no reliable way to find them, since the review system is a total scam with people purchasing reviews, leaving negative reviews on rivals, and begging their friends and family to review.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's not just your average novel though. Lots of best sellers and awardwinners had some rejections, often way more than Rowling. 

 That's why it's a big deal. In a rational, fair world, where author skill is linked to ease of getting published, you'd expect the most popular books to be identified as such from the people whose job it is to find them.

I think you make a big mistake equating "author skill" with "most popular books"! </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  But a shit ton of people liked it anyway.

Well one thing we should do is separate "sold" from "liked." 50 Shades became a big phenom, which means tons of people bought it just to hate read it or because it was famous and then didn't like it. 

But yes some people like it. I guess I don't think it follows that the book "did something" for those people in any real way. Or at least, I think there are 10,000 other books that could have done the exact same thing for those people. That 50 Shades became a mega hit and not the thousands of similar erotica novels is, to my mind, really just luck and marketing. It doesn't say anything about the quality of the work on any level. 

 Even if you, in your refined book taste, does not see it.

I don't think it has anything to do with refinery FWIW. I just think we should acknowledge that much of what gets popular has to do with luck, marketing, and other factors that don't relate to the work itself. I also think that fame is all about snowballing. Once something starts getting famous, it gets more and more that way. That's true of even high brow literature (say the Goldfinch the other year). Also true of films, restaurants, and a million other things. That's all.

Really? I normally see even big fantasy and HP fans ding her for her lazy world building.

50 Shades of Gray is the best selling book around and the author literally can't write basic sentences that even make sense. (Google "worst 50 Shades sentences" if you want to see and cringe.) 

Rowling is WAAAAAY better than EL James. But a book selling really well truly isn't any measure of quality. In fact, shitty books are more likely to sell well. And mediocre writers finish bad series all the time. Hell, there are probably literally thousands of self-published novel series on Amazon that haven't even sold 100 copies. 

 The book has to have done at least one thing really well so it resonates with people.

What do you make of the fact, posted below, that Rowling's pen name novel was selling horribly until it leaked that she was the author, then it shot up to #1? Was the book not doing anything well at first then magically started doing things well without being rewritten?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sure, of course it took thought/care/skill to create. They are fine books. But they are also highly formulaic and use very overused formulas. The orphan hero who learns he has a magical destiny is like THE classic hero journey trope. And /r/books sometimes has threads where people marvel at Rowling's creatures, not realizing they are almost all classic myth/fantasy creatures who've existed in a thousand other books. 

But hey, there's a reason they are formulas: they work. Most blockbuster films and bestselling books adhere to well-worn formulas. There's a reason, too, that Hollywood reboots the same characters and franchises over and over. It works and it sells.  </TEXT>

Well it's a business, but I think writers make a mistake blaming the industry. The problem is really readers. As you note, readers only buy books from names they know: 

 If I remember, her pen-name book was 5,000th on the best-sellers list. Until it was leaked that she authored it - then it jumped right up to number 1 for weeks on end.

If readers cared about emerging writers or unknown names, we'd all do better.  </TEXT>

The thing people forget in these conversations is that luck plays a huge factor here. There were probably dozens of books as good as, say, Twilight or Divergent even coving the same subject matters... (probably 10,000 books in the case of 50 shades) but they didn't catch on because of timing/luck/lack of marketing/ and whatever else. 

Point being, an agent is only "stupid" for passing on those books in retrospect. 9 times out of 10, Divergent would probably be a flop.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  As much as I agree that the Others will need to be addressed at some point, 

I don't think they will just be "addressed" I think they are the end game of the books. The others aren't just some random thing that's been mentioned, the narrative has totally  built them up as the central question. Consider: 

1) "Winter is coming" is like the most famous phrase in the book and we hear it from book one. The White Walkers bring winter. 

2) The Azhor Azhai prophecy is all about a hero saving humanity from the white walkers. Either Dany or Jon is AA reborn. 

3) The most magical and amazing element of westeros, the Wall, was built to keep out the others. 

4) The book is called A Song of Ice and Fire. Ice are the walkers, fire are the dragons (I guess). 

etc. 

Plus, Martin has said we are going to travel far north in book 6 so we'll learn a lot about them. 

 If Martin doesn't flake out and make the Others vanish entirely, then I suspect the show won't make them much more than a damp squib. 

I think you are totally wrong. I'd place money on the walkers being THE major baddies (from humanity's POV) who invade a Westeros weakend by war and are only stopped by Dany and her dragons, as well as the kingdoms uniting together. 

This doesn't mean we'll have a happy ending. Dany will probably die saving westeros, but still.  </TEXT>

Now, before you say that I don't know what he had planned, remember that Martin himself has openingly admitted that: 

a) Books 4/5 weren't even supposed to exist. He was going to do a time jump for book 4 but couldn't make it work so wrote two entirely unplanned books. 

b) Admitted he struggled for years to figure out the "meeranese knot" problem with Book 5

So Martin himself is pretty open about not fully having all this planned out and getting himself into trouble.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well the books are best sellers so they are a cultural phenomenon too. I see people reading them all the time. Sure the show is more popular, but that doesn't necessarily mean the books can't be the definite version. For example, I'm sure more people have watched Harry Potter than read the whole series, but the books are probably still the "real" version. Ditto Lord of the Rings. 

But Game of Thrones... if the show ends the plot it will probably go down as the real version.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I thought that HBO said they wanted more BUT would respect the showrunners wishes. (Of course HBO wants more, its popular and makes them money!) 

But look, let's say GRRM somehow gets The Winds of Winter out by spring of next year, right as season 6 starts. That means he only as a year to get a book out before season 7... but even if they go 8 or 9 seasons he'd only have 2-3 years to write the book. He doesn't seem capable of doing that at this point.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  onto a path that seems to make stuff gory because it generates PR, it seems.

Odd... I feel the show has gotten LESS gory and LESS sex-filled as it's gone on.. to it's benefit too.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I do wonder if the show will end up being the definitive version for the culture at large. Pretty strange to think about that happening, but it isn't totally unheard of (e.g., The Godfather film is THE Godfather, not the novel.) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah but the early books are always easier in a series. Tying up all the loose ends (especially when Martin keeps adding subplots!) takes more time, I think.  </TEXT>
