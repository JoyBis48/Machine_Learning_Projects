	<TITLE> Hi guys. I am looking for some input on what truck I should be looking for. Can anyone help? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-04-12 04:05:49 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Here is the breakdown.

I live in Connecticut so I need 4x4 as I have already had it with my previous jeep grand cherokee and can never go back. Winters get really rough here and my driveway is a pain


It will be my daily driver and my commute is approximately 20-25 miles a day all said and done.


I want to spend no more than $6500

I mainly need it for yard work/dump as my new house has a large yard and no woods in the back. I prefer a long bed as I will be using it for holding my kayak and summer sports gear. 

This will be my first truck. What should I be looking for? Thank you for any response.

	<TITLE> The time I missed out on getting 2 free VIP tickets to a Beck show...yet still ended up going to the show. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-02-01 01:11:11 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I was living in Seattle and it was around '99. I had entered a contest on Becks website to win a prize package. At the time I was 21 years old, living in a rented room in a band house and barely used the internet. 

A friend of mine bought me tickets to the Beck show at Key Arena as a surprise. It was the Midnite Vultures tour and I freaking knew it was going to be a god damn funky ass shit show. I brought my "demo tape" of  various songs I had created on a shitty four track in my back pocket. I snuck in a joint and had my robot dancing shoes on. 

Ths show, of course kicked ass. The one thing that really stood out was when he did Debra he started it by being lowered down on a king size bed. I thought that shit was the smoothest thing I had ever seen (and still do). At some point I threw my tape up on stage only to see some stage hand kick it back off :(....

Cut to about 3 days after the show I receive a good size package in the mail at work (that was the only address I really trusted at that time) I open it up to find every Beck album released to date...signed by Beck, a t-shirt and a letter that explained what everything was and it said "we hope you enjoyed your VIP experience" 

WTF!!!!

I rev up my bosses beige IBM desktop and sign on to my hotmail (which I never checked...apparently) to find an email congratulating me on winning the prize package. I was to pick up my 2 VIP passes at will call at the same fucking show I went to. 

Yep. That happened. </TEXT>
