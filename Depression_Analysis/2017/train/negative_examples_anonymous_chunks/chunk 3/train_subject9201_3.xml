	<TEXT> Yep, that's pretty crunchy. 

What you can do, is play a one-shot in Fate, or AW/DW. Then when you go to Traveller, it'll feel plenty crunchy.

Fate is absolutely not crunchy enough for me. Every time I've played it, I've disliked it. However, I use the rules from Fate to lighten up more crunchy games, and I actually love some of the concepts in it.

If you are looking for crunchy, I highly recommend Iron Kingdoms RPG, or any of the Warhammer40k Roleplay games (my favorite is Rogue Trader, but it's definitely not everyone's favorite). Rogue Trader could actually probably serve you pretty well for whatever you were planning to do with Traveller, too. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I expect we will see these exact same boxes again. They used them to boost interest in the game and get people into new factions, and they will probably let that ride for a while. In a year or two, if they have a bit of a slump (or even if they suspect one), they will probably do another limited release of these same boxes. They don't need to do new stuff in the boxes because the majority of people didn't buy every box they would ever want, and it still presents the same value to new players. Also, these boxes were very much "core" lists, with almost no overlap with battleboxes.  </TEXT>

If it was me (and I may do this if I buy him, since I run pirates all the time), I'd see if I could just cut his hat off, and sculpt a tricorn out of green stuff. Then you could just paint him with a "piratey" theme and he'd be good to go.

There's seriously as many ways to do it as there are people who could do it.

	<TEXT> Are you looking for a tournament legal conversion? If so, that's going to be hard to get it looking like the exclusive one, as you need 50%+ of the original model, and they are actually quite a bit different (the only thing that's really even similar is the gas mask and the grenades). 

Now, if you aren't worried about it being tourney legal, it's not at all hard to put a gas mask on a pirate mini and give him a few grenades.

It all depends on what you are looking for.

*edit: If all you are looking for is the normal gorman mini with a pirate hat, that's pretty easy to do. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Technically you are both right. For the sake of the fact that he's the one who used the word first, based on his definition, your system is not balanced. There is nothing wrong with that if that's what you like. 

Some people think games need to be balanced in certain ways, others don't. Some people like point buy, some people like randomly rolled. It's just a preference thing.

Basically, there are two types of one-armed men. One type will insist you tie one of your hands behind your back to make it a fair fight (and will usually still bitch about fairness if they lose, and generally cry some more like a little baby). The other type will kick your ass with just his one arm, and be all the more of a badass for it.

Personally, I think the kind of balance he is talking about makes for a terrible game (D D4e, looking at you here). That kind of balance really only matters in competitive adversarial games. Which to me, aren't roleplaying games. GMs aren't the bad guy, they just decide what the bad guy does. The other players aren't your competition, they are your friends. Or at least, that's how I roll.

Your game sounds like fun, and already I'm interested in hearing more. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You rang? 

I love complex games. I like having rules for everything, and then just ignoring them if I don't need them at the moment. 

[Iron Kingdoms RPG](http://privateerpress.com/iron-kingdoms/core-products/iron-kingdoms-core-rules) is a great complex game (quick start rules [here](http://files.privateerpress.com/ironkingdoms/documents/adventures/IKRPG_Scenario_Fools_Rush_In.pdf) and [here](http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/146332/Iron-Kingdoms-Unleashed-An-Introduction-to-Savagery)). It is built from the Warmachine wargame rules (which was built from D D3e). When I run a fantasy game, I run IKRPG. One of the things that it does well over a lot of other complex games is that combat is still really quick (mostly because nothing lives past 2 or 3 rounds). It's a dynamic and deadly system that is great for people who love strategy who want a great fantasy game. Also, the new standalone expansion has probably the [best starter box of all time](http://privateerpress.com/iron-kingdoms/core-products/iron-kingdoms-unleashed-adventure-kit). 

Another great complex game is the **Warhammer40k Roleplay** series (*Dark Haresy II* is newest, though my favorite is still *Rogue Trader*). The WH40k universe is so rich and complex that it really needs a complex rules system to do it justice. Hundreds and hundreds of weapon and armor options, table after table after table of injury results, hundreds of spaceship options, dozens of character origin options, a robust skill list... there is enough crunch here to choke a heretic. It's a little rigid, and I have some home-rules that loosen it up a bit, but it also has the structure of a wargame for its roots, and combat is deliciously strategic, deadly, and lots of fun. Combats tend to be longer than IKRPG games, and that's something that is pretty common with complex games, but it's not horrible, and they are definitely fun and interesting combats, with lots of options. 

**Dungeons and Dragons** has two editions that I would count as complex, 3.5/PF and 4e. For me, they both have the same problem, and that is that combat takes too long, and gets pretty boring. There are other things I could say about them, but I'm not going to fight an Edition Wars battle here.

*Special mention*: There are several games that I actually don't think are very complex, but that are somewhat tricky to learn. Mostly you just need someone who already knows how to play to run it for you, but it's still enough to get mentioned.

**Eclipse Phase**: Great setting, strangely complex (and maybe just a smidge poorly organized) rules. Available for free, which means you can check it out before you invest.

new **Star Wars** (Edge of the Empire, etc.): I actually consider the system itself to be pretty simple, but the dice are kind of crazy. All the complexity lies in interpreting the funky dice, which allows the game to play like a rules-lite game. 

**Burning Wheel**: I can't even say much (I just can't even). I bought the book, tried to understand it, and I can't do it. It's complex, but not in any way that any other game is. I don't even know. From what I've heard, it's actually really good though.

**Savage Worlds**: This is deceptively complex. It tries to pretend like it's a simple game, but it has so many different options and bits and pieces and moving parts that it's hard to take it all in at first. Great system though, and it can really play any style of "high action" pulpy sort of game. I'll always have it just for *Deadlands*.

**BRP**, **CoC**, **RQ**, etc: I've played a few of these games, and they are are pretty complex, but they make so much sense that it doesn't take much to learn them. CoC is probably the most popular of them all. 

edited for formatting

edit2: 
**Super Special Bonus Round!**
I forgot to mention **Mutants   Masterminds**. Hundreds and hundreds of options that allow you to custom design any imaginable character. On top of that, the combat rules are at least as complex as any d20 game. 

also **Shadowrun**. Very complex, and it works well for the setting.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In the theme of recommending you buy stuff that comes with minis instead of buying minis by themselves, I highly recommend the new [Iron Kingdoms Unleashed Adventure Kit](http://privateerpress.com/iron-kingdoms/core-products/iron-kingdoms-unleashed-adventure-kit). You can get it for about $35, and it has 14 minis, which makes them about $2.50 each.

Also, 

Unfortunately I don't have any friends to play wargames with...

hit me right in the feels, whydontcha? I highly recommend going to your local gaming store (sometimes they are disguised as comic book stores). If you ask, they probably have a night during the week where they do tabletop games (even if it's just Pathfinder or D D5e). Once you find your local wargamers, you can let them know you want to start playing, and they'll try to push their product on you. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'll recommend Stars Without Number for you. It's simple, can use a grid well, and has a lot of amazing features that you won't find elsewhere. 

Also, a possible good stepping stone into tabletop games would be some wargames. Something like [Deadzone](http://www.manticgames.com/games/deadzone.html) would be a great way to get used to playing tabletops, and you could go from there to something like Stars Without Number. Plus then you get to use all those great minis and terrain for your rpg!  </TEXT>

They can interact with it, respond to it, and change it. It becomes something more because of their contribution. Together, you become a story-telling team. Their lives in your world will live on in all your memories. 

It becomes real. The judgments you make will define the laws of your world. The more consistent you are, the more it will become a real place in the players mind, and not just decoration draped over a dice game. 

You are also the conduit of fun for the group. Through you, fighting and arguing turns into adventure. You can turn sadness and bitterness into growth. Selfishness and spite become mystery. You can make the weak feel strong, and the ordinary feel extraordinary. You can make people fear or hope, laugh or cry. 

Basically, everyone should try it so they can feel [like a boss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NisCkxU544c). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Also, before anyone else beats me to it, I want to play [Devil's advocate](http://imgur.com/gallery/9Huvs) a minute. 

It's the GM's job to keep the game world consistent. Part of that job is making judgement calls on what the player's can and can't do (or what their odds are). They aren't perfect, and they are trying to weigh their decision based on the written rules (written by some other imperfect schmuck), the desires of each player (each one probably different from the other), his understanding of physics (not even real physics, but fake physics), his personal preferences, and his (probably constantly changing) vision of an imaginary world. It's a lot of responsibility, and he probably deserves some slack. Not all the calls he makes are going to be the right ones. If he's not making them the way you'd like them enough for you to have fun, then just don't play in his game, and try to find someone who does. Always feel free to discuss your opinion with your GM, though (though sometimes you should wait till after the game).

Basically, this post is advice for the player, the first post is advice for the GM.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've had one or two try, but in a game where how well you do is based on how cool/fun what you are trying to do is, there's not really any need (or benefit) from trying to "game the system". Honestly I can't think of anyone who successfully "got one over on me" or anything like that, and I've played with some crafty (read: pain-in-the-ass) players.

edit: I will say though, it does take a bit of trust between me and my players. I don't have them keep track of things like inventory or ammunition, which lets them have what they need when they need it... until they don't. Basically when I think it'd be cool/fun to have their shit *not* work, I get the same ability to say "You are out of bullets" or "They've traced your call, and you're not sure how". I don't use things like, "You, a highly trained spy, was a total idiot and butt dialed them using your real phone" though, everything I say and decision I make has a reason. If it's likely you used a burner phone, and they tracked you down anyway, there is [something fucky going on](http://imgur.com/r/gifs/IgU4Y), like they have a mole in your group, or they have a super-hacker with ties to the NSA, or they slipped a tracker or bug on your while you were there.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I force my players to do this, and I do it all the time, with no limits and no checks. I get tired of great ideas thrown out because someone didn't think of it on the spot. Especially with people newer to gaming, but even with old pros. That's how you get games where people decide what to do based on what's on their sheet (I attack the guy with my sword), instead of doing what roleplaying is all about (I throw my sword at the rope holding the chandelier before jumping onto and riding it into the three guys on the floor below). 

To the asshole GMs who are like, "Should have thought of that before" "That's lazy roleplaying" "Blah, blah, blah", guess what? You aren't perfect. *It is 10000% impossible for you to convey every detail of your fictional world to them all time.* They don't have the advantage that their characters have of actually being there. I'm going to blindfold you, put earplugs in your ears, plug your nose, and shoot you full of drugs before throwing you in an unfamiliar foreign country. We'll see how well you do. They can't see, they can't hear, they can't smell, taste, touch, or anything of your world. All they can do is ask you what's there, and imagine it based on your shit description. And yeah, your description is shit. If it wasn't, you'd be so busy making millions off your best selling novels you wouldn't have time for gaming anymore. 

*All of that*, and I haven't even mentioned the fact that people are not their characters yet (don't worry, I'm about to). I am not a spy. I am not a warrior. I am not a wizard. I am not a hacker. I am not a rogue. Unless I am playing a damn fine looking tabletop gamer, or a charming anthropologist, I am not my fucking khakis (I mean characters). *Excuuuuuuuuse me* if I don't think of something a *real* spy would think of *before* I'm even in a situation they might be in (while having only the very limited knowledge of what's going on of being completely blind/deaf/numb with only your pretty vague description to help me out).

	<TEXT> Homebrew is just another word for home-made.

What you meant to say, was how you don't get why they are saying "game", when they mean "setting", since they could very easily have used the term "home-made" instead of "homebrew" and it wouldn't have changed anything.

To that, [you are kinda right](http://i.imgur.com/40Idny0.png). Except that "homebrew game" can mean a game that **is** homebrew, *or* it could mean a game that **contains** homebrew, or even just a game loosely associated with homebrew.

There is no need to "qualify" as a homebrew game, because there isn't an RPG Association that we pay dues to that will cite us for improperly labeling our games (if you *do* run such an organization, then I'm wrong, and you should have mentioned it in your post). Don't use being a grognard as an excuse to be an elitist prick. It makes the rest of the old guard look bad.
