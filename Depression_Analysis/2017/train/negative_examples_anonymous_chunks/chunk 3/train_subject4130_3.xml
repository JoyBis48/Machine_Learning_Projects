Did you read that article? It clearly states his intentions were to repeal the 2001 Iraq legislation and LIMIT intervention in mid east. It even stated people will only see this as "Rand Paul wants to go to war". Just as you see it, but that's not the case at all. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Many didn't like it because launch settings were trash. But within the game itself, there were custom tools, forge world and the best forge system yet, plus the title update. It made that game arguably the best playing halo.

Seriously, go back on your 360 and launch Reach. Then head into the MLG playlist. It's easily the best variant of halo gameplay to date. Smooth and full of skill. The game also had some of the best custom games and forge world allowed for players creativity and content to flow. If it had better launch settings, it would have been almost as popular as halo 3.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That was absolutely incredible. After reading the lines from H3 terminals, it just screams the old plan of "humans were forerunners".

So to sum this up a bit more. Humanity is facing: 

- Rebellion and dissent within its military and outer colonies

- Flood's possible return. And in heavy numbers

- Jul and Halsey (whom are both hellbent on revenge) have the Janus key and every piece of forerunner tech. 

- plus, a fuckton of Promethean knights at their disposal and the manipulative covie religion is on the rise. 

- John is AWOL at a time that is arguably **more threatening then the human covie war**. Humanities greatest hero abandoned them when they needed him most. </TEXT>

They never, ever play it as enemies at all. Theyre just two gentlemen having fun with each other. The Doctors best friend is a murdering psychopath, thats actually quite fun."

	<TEXT> So this is no longer a debate on the logical legitimacy of him as a GOP candidate. And is now about his political views, opinions, and philosophies. As such we'd be debating and advocating certain policies and the reasoning behind why something should or should not happen.

As much as I could debate and refute everything you're saying, I simply have no time or interest in getting into a long drawn out and useless internet debate about fiscal matters and other opposing viewpoints.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You just disqualified every candidate running if you think those politifact statements, an opinion on vaccines, and a false statement about a legitimately half right figure on tax fraud to make a point that was still properly made regardless of the money figure (was still around 25%) make him unfit for any office. Then this means nearly every single person holding public office isn't fit for office, or the majority of our past presidents. That simply isn't a realistic and logical dismissal of his ability for office

You could do a quick google search on any public figure and get shit. You could even go in the opposite direction and google good things about him. The fact that you can Google has no bearing on this argument. As a result, none of what you linked can hardly qualify as being disconnected from reality; if that's the case, then most of Washington needs to be thrown in a mental hospital. Nor can you just dismiss his supporters as being simply "enamored" 

I don't support some of what he says and I don't think he's the savior of murica (so I'm clearly not enamored) but he's a foot in the door toward the direction we need to go. Change won't happen over night. 

Edit: Did you even read that full article you linked me on him? It praises some of his policy decisions and stand points. Specifically on states rights, marijuana, gay marriage, spying and more.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  respect among his peers

Really? He specifically goes against establishment republicans for obvious reasons. His goal is to get the party back to it's roots, they aren't going to like him. 

What false statements? The man wants to decriminalize MJ, end mass surveillance, stop unnecessary intervention and useless wars, impose congressional term limits and eliminate career politicians. What other candidate wants to do any of that? How is any of that "disconnected from reality"?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'll put on some more effort. I'd love to explore mexico. But it can be very dangerous down there, as I'm sure you're aware. But these people are more deadly, much more heavily funded, armed to the teeth with top grade military weapons, and smarter then ISIS terrorists, they are the government in many places. The militias are just starting to fight back.

They won't be afraid to behead you for 5 dollars and especially if you look foreign. It gets better the more south you go, but I think traveling through north will prove to be an issue. Good luck. </TEXT>
