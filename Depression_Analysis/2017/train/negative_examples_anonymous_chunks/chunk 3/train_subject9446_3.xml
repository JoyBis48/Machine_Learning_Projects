And according to Wikipedia: 'Fourteen Comanche code talkers took part in the [Invasion of Normandy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasion_of_Normandy), and continued to serve in the 4th Infantry Division during further European operations'. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Every social society involves some form of agreement to treat your fellow members well

I don't think so. Such an agreement is certainly more explicit in Freemasonry than other groups.

 taking an oath to provide assistance to members of a group makes you incapable of acting rationally

That's not what I'm saying. Partiality and irrationality are not identical terms. 

 if you abuse the public trust, then you aren't acting as a Mason.

So long as that credo is at the forefront of their mind then good on them. When that is ignored society as a whole suffers. 

If it is the case that justice is not perverted through the existence of Freemason cabals, then I retract my insinuations to the contrary. The way things are, however, I will be offering no such retraction. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We can't just freeze and starve to death until someone comes up with a hydrogen car and replaces our source of the majority of our electricity. The current demand must be met, or our entire infrastructure would collapse.

You're putting the cart before the horse. If the demand and will for clean energy is there then the economy and energy industry can reorientate accordingly. The German government intends to garner 60% of energy from renewables by 2050. Other nations should follow suit. For the United Kingdom to lift its ban on fracking at this moment in time is a misstep that could have dire consequences both actually and qua gesture politics. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That Andy Weir piece is a fine piece of writing. Now you mention it, I think it has been an influence on me too. Can't remember when exactly I first read it though.

Have you listened to any lectures by Alan Watts? I think you'd like them.

Do you think it was compassion that made you weep as well as confusion? </TEXT>

	<TEXT>    Though absent long,	

These forms of beauty have not been to me,	

As is a landscape to a blind man's eye:	

But oft, in lonely rooms, and mid the din	

Of towns and cities, I have owed to them,	

In hours of weariness, sensations sweet,	

Felt in the blood, and felt along the heart,	

And passing even into my purer mind	

With tranquil restoration:feelings too	

Of unremembered pleasure; such, perhaps,	

As may have had no trivial influence	

**On that best portion of a good man's life;**

**His little, nameless, unremembered acts**	

**Of kindness and of love.** Nor less, I trust,	

To them I may have owed another gift,	

Of aspect more sublime; that blessed mood,	

In which the burthen of the mystery,	

In which the heavy and the weary weight	

Of all this unintelligible world	

Is lighten'd:that serene and blessed mood,	

In which the affections gently lead us on,	

Until, the breath of this corporeal frame,	

And even the motion of our human blood	

Almost suspended, we are laid asleep	

In body, and become a living soul:	

While with an eye made quiet by the power	

Of harmony, and the deep power of joy,	

We see into the life of things.  </TEXT>

I'm sure an equally lucid case for the other side could be made. Terrible business all told. As an Englishman one can't help feel things were largely the fault of the British. Oh well.... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I touch on that in the CMV thread. John Stuart Mill expresses some of my thoughts in chapter two of Utilitarianism - the section containing the famous statement about it being 'better to be Socrates unsatisfied than a pig satisfied'. I also touch on that which makes relationship between the consumer and creator of games different to the creator/consumer relationship in music and movies. In short, games require a greater acquiescence and obeisance from the consumer towards the creator than other media. Additionally, the active participation of the gamer as an agent within the game is a cause of harm. The artificiality creates anomie, through the toxic effect of the necessarily meaningless and unimportant game-world, whereas the mimesis with the real world encourages immorality/immoralism through conditioning (e.g. encouraging violence). 

I also imply, in an aside, that games bring out the bad of competitive sport (brutishness, ruthlessness, and tribalism/egoism, etc. etc. ) with none of the benefits - e.g. exercise.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Why I believe that playing video games is a waste of time and a corrupting influence. </TITLE>

	<TEXT> I believe that playing video games is a waste of time and a corrupting influence on an otherwise healthy human being. My first objection to video games is founded on the belief that they do nothing good. My second objection is that they do something bad. [edit for /r/philsophy: Moreover, I believe that playing video games is morally indefensible.]

I cannot think of any good that video games do. Where things that resemble video games have a practical implementation they are not called 'video games'. A pilot learning on a flight stimulator has an equivalence to an air traffic controller monitoring a graphic of in-air flights. Neither is playing a game because neither is using a tool that has real-world importance. Whereas a 'video game' is a trivial enterprise, ('game'), in a dimension that doesn't truly exist. The 'video' is just electronic pixels producing an illusion. Existence pertains to that universe that we live in. That of time, space, feeling, and suffering.

The 'unreal world' setting of video games leads to the conditions arising that result in their real-world harm. Whilst I can imagine a game developer with the best intentions trying to create a game which tries to instil good character traits in the 'gamer', I believe her attempt would be fruitless. Any encouragement of positive characteristics would necessarily be concomitant with a diminution and tainting of the 'real world' through association with the 'unreal world'. This leads to apathy and alienation.
Furthermore, if the game developer doesn't approach the project of making a game with the best of intentions then the game will inevitably enforce or reinforce bad character traits. A game that is made with disregard to encouraging moral virtues will lead to a game that encourages immorality (or amorality - as covered above). I believe that this has happened and is happening. It is well illustrated by these comments made by a leading creative

"Hardcore gamers basically love to watch the baby hit the floor. They said I want a game where I can shoot somebody in the head and blow their head off, so the gaming industry moved in that direction. So thats what theyre doing. And you cant empathize with somebody youre going to kill, so that whole idea has gone out the window."

(Games that encourage a ruthless, competitive win-at-all-costs mentality are equally guilty in their ability to clip the 'Angel's wings' that is human potential).


I believe that video games are good for nothing more than as a good example of how to waste time and corrupt. (And that there are better ways to learn such lessons!)

	<TEXT> Thus was Mr. Pickwick brought face to face with the difficulty of seeing his own counsel.  He could not understand why, having retained the services of a professional man and paid for them, there should exist any impediment to prevent access to him.  I wont discuss to-night the advisability or non-advisability of dividing the profession of the law into two parts, but I do say that any system which prevents litigants having the fullest personal communication with those they have paid to represent them is an anomaly and an absurdity.

But Mr. Pickwick was a person of determination, and he did see Serjeant Snubbin, and he delivered to that learned gentleman a short address that was well worthy of his attention, as it is of every member of the Bar, including your very humble servant.

Gentlemen of your profession, sir, continued Mr. Pickwick, see the worst side of human nature.  All its disputes, all its ill-will and bad blood, rise up before you.  You know from your experience of juries (I mean no disparagement to you, or them) how much depends upon effect; and you are apt to attribute to others a desire to use, for purposes of deception and self-interest, the very instruments which you, in pure honesty and honour of purpose, and with a laudable desire to do your utmost for your client, know the temper and worth of so well, from constantly employing them yourselves.  I really believe that to this circumstance may be attributed the vulgar but very general notion of your being, as a body, suspicious, distrustful, and overcautious.  Conscious as I am, sir, of the disadvantage of making such a declaration to you, under such circumstances, I have come here, because I wish you distinctly to understand, as my friend Mr. Perker has said, that I am innocent of the falsehood laid to my charge; and although I am very well aware of the inestimable value of your assistance, sir, I must beg to add that, unless you sincerely believe this, I would rather be deprived of the aid of your talents than have the advantage of them. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> [In 1904, Elizabeth "Lizzie" Magie designed a board game to demonstrate the tragic effects of land-grabbing. In this game, oligarchs enrich themselves at the expense of tenants, the latter of whom only grow poorer as available land decreases and the cost of rent increases. Anyone interested in traveling a non-trivial distance has to pony up for a railroad ticket. Anyone desiring light and water had better open their wallet. And crossing the wrong landowner sends a player directly to jail. The poorer the proletarian player gets, the more he or she is squeezed; there is nowhere to go that doesnt demand a fee of some kind, and there is no respite. The game ends only when everyone is driven penniless into the ground, but for a single aristocrat who now owns everything. Lizzie Magie named her grim reflection of life The Landlords Game, but you probably know it better as Monopoly.](http://mentalfloss.com/article/48787/retrobituaries-elizabeth-lizzie-magie-inventor-monopoly) </TEXT>

Sadly ~~one of~~ the mods ~~(_____)~~ has deleted this thread so people won't get to see your helpful post. Which is a shame because it might have stopped less people dying from horrible, currently incurable diseases in the future. Because of ~~_____'s~~ actions (which I believe are the result of being 'butthurt' over having her 'holy-cow' of video games openly disparaged) many more people may die long, slow painful deaths than would have otherwise.

I must emphasise however that I am giving you the Changer's Cap for your help sciencey game links - they could (potentially) be useful whilst still being little more than a numbing (nay, infantilising) pastime for the player (as is common to all video games) - and not your last two points.

Your spouse point is not a good one. They will become each other's [enablers](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=enabler) and probably(/possibly?) bring disappointment to their friends and relatives.

As for playing Lego, St. Paul said it well when he said 'When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things.'

Edit: The rot within the moderators' union goes deeper than I had first thought. Be vigilant regarding missing posts and any patterns that might occur. </TEXT>
