	<TEXT> Just watched [Metro Manila](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1845838/) because of friends' recommendations.  Living in this city, the movie was quite an eye-opener. Directed by Sean Ellis, the movie won quite a number of international awards. Anyone else seen it? 

P.S. Highly recommended. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What is more amazing then a moment spent hugging your child?  Or watching him laugh with all his heart in a way only children can.  Or a touch and a smile from your spouse that says more than words ever could?  Or an intimate moment shared that no one else will ever know about.  There is so much beauty in each moment and there will never be another exactly like it.  Its those things that are most rare that have the most value, and there are only so many moments that we get.  Choose to believe that you cant waste time with your spouse, because no moment with them can be a waste.  There is value in every second together.

My mom passed away from gastric cancer a month ago after almost a year-long battle, which was terrible on all of us. Your story makes me sad and happy at the same time. Thanks for sharing it, and all the best to you and your family. </TEXT>
