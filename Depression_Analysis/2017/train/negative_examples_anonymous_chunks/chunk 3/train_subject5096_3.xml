	<TEXT> i may not be as bad as you, i like hanging out with one friend at a time. whenever someone calls me up i make sure it's only us two kicking it. i stutter and can't pronounce the letter R, i think this is why i'm so quiet around groups of people. i only have one friend now because my other good friends got addicted to shooting up heroin and are no longer the same people i became friends with, so i ignore their calls and texts. i feel awful every time they call and i ignore it. and my other not so good friends, i finally realized only called me because they needed something like for me to drive them around. i guess i needed someone to vent to, thank you stranger </TEXT>

	<TEXT> i was thinking about buying a fleshlight (those flashlight vagina things) and told a story about how i bought mine. i was sitting in my car on the street outside my apartment building in seattle, smoking a cigarette. it was raining and a homeless woman carrying a baby walked by and i asked her if she wanted a cigarette and get warm in my car for a minute. she accepted. her face actually lit up because i treated her like a person. we get to talking and it's obvious from her face and teeth that she does a lot of hardcore drugs. i point out where i live and offer to take care of her baby for her. she gratefully but remorsefully accepts, and i give her 40 bucks so she'll get out of my car and go buy drugs before she stinks it up. she hugs and kisses her crack-dumpster baby and cries as she walks to the food shelter. i lied to her about where i live and i just got a fleshlight, but now i'm thinking about getting one that doesn't cry and need to be fed </TEXT>
