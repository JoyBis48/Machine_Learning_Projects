	<TEXT> I thought it was a bit bland, uninspiring and mediocre. The slapstick and whole tone of the movie is just missing charm, it's just nothing special. I've seen much, much better from Woody Allen. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  It's not easy to put these into genres.       

That doesn't mean that one should just put movies where they don't really belong.       


 I put this under Samurai because it needed to go on the list and I meant period drama. However, I have heard people using the term "Samurai Cinema" as a synonym to period drama.        

Period dramas are called jidaigeki. Samurai movies or "sword fighting" movies are called chanbara, which is a subgenre of jidaigeki. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The last one under "Yakuza", the film by Imamura isn't a film about yakuza, it's about a serial killer that wasn't at all affiliated with the yakuza. And putting Batoru rowaiaru (2000) under "Yakuza" films too? That doesn't make sense. Also, neither Narayama bushik (1958) or Narayama bushik (1983) (depending on which film you mean) have anything to do with samurais. Just these things makes me wonder if the person who did the list actually watched the films. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm glad to hear that! That's some amazing movies!    

 But you must be crazy if you think that a person who had such an acute negative reaction to Scorpio Rising would enjoy these two - similarly subversive, daring and at times campish - films. No way in hell.              



Oh, I didn't think that at all. I took those two (or three) as examples of some of my favourites just to put it in context with what is unknown and not for that specific user, because I was wondering about that part. But anyways, the user was just asking about what I considered as absolutely great of the ones that are more unknown, so it wasn't specifically something that had to be according to the user's taste, just mine. I think our tastes already differ a bit from the beginning, I for example really like Dead Man (1995). When it comes to Scorpio Rising (1964), it's quite different than the movies I took as examples though, I wouldn't call the ones I mentioned campy either. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, thanks! Or something, heh. I think I started going through the list a couple of years ago, maybe 4, not more than 5 at least. I did not stricly go by it though, I watched a lot of other stuff in between.       


 I'd love to talk to you more about the whole thing.       


Feel free to ask anything if you have more questions, I'd be happy answer them as good as I can.    


Hidden gems, you say? Well, it depends what you mean with great but otherwise quite unknown. The ones I like the most in the list aren't really that unknown. But it's hard to just put some titles out if I don't know what you consider unknown. A certain amount of ratings on IMDb? Checks on ICheckMovies? Or anything else? For example, Jalsaghar (1958) by Satyajit Ray and Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (1975) by Chantal Akerman aren't really unknown if you are cinephile, but a general user that hangs out on r/movies may have never heard about them. Those two are some of my favourite movies on the list, same with Die bitteren Trnen der Petra von Kant (1972) by Rainer Werner Fassbinder. But as I said, I wouldn't consider them unknown, so it's hard to pinpoint out any specific movies if I don't exactly known what your criteria would be. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I felt that it was qutie bad in the start, but got better as it went on. The plot felt thin overall, the same thing with the characters. I appretiate what Gosling is trying to do here, but many things felt forced and that he was trying to be poetic, shocking and cool, but failed. Almost like he wanted to do a mix of Lynch, Argento, Korine and Refn, but with mostly style over substance. It didn't have anything really special making it quite good. On the other hand, it's better than a lot of stuff coming nowadays from Hollywood at least. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have only 5 films left on that list, so I'm guess I'm still going. I have waited with some of those I have left for different reasons. But the so called "ride" was fun and interesting so far. And of course, some movies weren't at all great, but many were. I see it as a list of movies that are good to know about when you are talking about cinema in general. The list also changes through the years. It's also many different films, so you probably get a lot out of your comfort zone, which is good if you are studying films a bit more than usual. One good thing is that you get a lot of reference to work with, which is useful in many ways. I think it's good to mix your watchlist too, to not feel obliged just to go after this particular list. Remember to watch what you want to watch. On another note, TSPDT has a list that's a bit more interesting and diverse if you want to dive into similar missions. Although, both focus pretty much on American cinema and Europe, so much stuff is left out, same with experimental films for example.        
      

I'm a person who likes lists, so these things are often enjoyable for me, but I of course always have other movies to watch at the same time. As someone else said, think of it as a guide, it's great for beginners, because you get a glimpse of the history of cinema in a way, and you'll probably learn about and discover different directors etc. You don't have to like every single movie, it's great to be critical and know what you like and not like. Be prepared to be seeing movies that you maybe won't like, don't forget that. What I'm saying is that it's a great list to start with as a guide if you are just getting interested in movies. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Some of them are really innovative, brave, special and have much interesting political content. Just take Nema-ye Nazdik (1990) by Abbas Kiarostami for example. It's about a man pretending to be the famous Iranian director Mohsen Makhmalbaf, he convinces a family that he's making a movie and promises them a part in it. The interesting part is that the actual people involved in the incident re-enact the actual events. It also features footage from the real trial that took place. The mix between fiction and documentary is great, just like the erasing of borders with what is real and what is staged. The meta aspects give it great depth too. Kiarostami is one of the most interesting directors working today.          

Other Iranian films that are good and important to check out as well:

	<TEXT> Not really. The whole character felt forced, too obvious and over the top. Almost like a movie for children. But then again, even if I cared for him, the film had way bigger problems. And I should add that for me, it really doesn't matter if I can sympathize with the characters, it doesn't directly make a movie better or worse, which some other people think. Some examples of the pathetic dialogue:    

* *"Chappie if you want to be in the gang you have to be cool, like daddy! Look how daddy walks! Look how cool it's! Need to keep it gangsta' Chappie!"*      

* *"It's time to pump up the jam!"*

	<TEXT>  Will 2015 go down as one of the great years in movies?    

I really doubt that. Why would it? The year isn't even over yet. I don't think we'll see the amount of masterpieces this year that will make 2015 something special worth remembering as a mark in the history of cinema. I feel that a huge miracle would have to happen if 2015 could offer something that could even be near to compete with some great years in the past. I would say that the great years are long gone and that it's been like that for a long time. Of course, some good movies come out now and then, but to put this year so high up already? That seems like a stretch.     



 Already we've got one of the best Action, sci-fi, and Horror movies in decades.           


Well, that's your opinion. But I think you should think about it and give it a couple of years, then go back and see if you still feel the same. It seems that the general public on Reddit always have a thing to hype every year this way. All of this really makes me wonder how many movies people have seen. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I thought it was horrible. For a narrative film of this kind, the story was too simple sided and in the end, you don't really care about anything at all. The whole movie felt something like a promotional commercial for Die Antwoord, which was silly. And quite everything actually felt silly, stupid, hollow and over the top in a bad way. From the pathetic dialogue to the action and to how it was shot. It's hard to take it seriously, because it doesn't work as a comedy or any kind of critique of something either. It makes me wonder if Blomkamp offered someone from junior high to write him the dialogue. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you want good movies about geishas, I would suggest to skip Memoirs of a Geisha (2005) that some people already told you about. Instead, I recommend these:   

* Gion bayashi (1953)   
* Gion no shimai (1936)   
* Kimi to wakarete (1933)    
* Saikaku ichidai onna (1952)    
* Uwasa no onna (1954)    

Especially Mizoguchi's movies about geishas were great, they have a very feminist touch, and it's also interesting because his sister was a geisha too. Great director, particularly Gion bayashi (1953) and Saikaku ichidai onna (1952) are some of his best ones. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I didn't like it at all. It felt quite superficial with silly and nonsensical action scenes that were supposed to be "cool", but rather felt tiresome and perfunctory. I really disliked the visual style too. And original? I would say the opposite. The movie didn't do anything original, nuanced, experimental or interesting at all with the time travel concept. Many things just seemed rehashed from before. There's other movies that actually have something intriguing to say about time travel, this was mostly just a cheap Hollywood take on it with a big slab of shallow action to disguise everything and please the general Tom Cruise fan. But this is just what I thought and I'm probably stepping on some toes, especially here on Reddit where people seem to praise this film and have very low standards overall. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Kakushi-toride no san-akunin (1958) and Divorzio all'italian (1961) that you are namedropping are for example available on Hulu. Netflix seems to be overall quite bad if you are looking after movies outside Hollywood or the mainstream and even older movies. To take an example, the Swedish version is a joke if you are looking for movies before 1960. There's other streaming services though, like Hulu, Fandor and Mubi that are much better if you are in search for older flicks. Also, buying physical copies is a great way to do it too. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I also almost forgot about Nema-ye Nazdik (1990), it really deserves to be mentioned in this case. It's quite special, because it's a mix of both fiction film and documentary. It's about a man pretending to be the Iranian director Mohsen Makhmalbaf who takes advantage of a family while promising them to be involved in his next film. It's actually based on real events and the roles of the real people who were involved in the story are played by themselves. Great movie! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No, none. I hope they will do it in the future. Other companies have released some of their stuff though, I know that there's at least two movies from Has that's been released in Poland on Blu-ray, but several other movies from those three directors deserve the Blu-ray treatment too, especially a bit more universal versions. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> To make it short, it's one of the best and most important Polish films ever made, particularly about Poland's war and post-war history, just that makes it worth watching. If you have any interest in cinema at all, it's a mandatory watch. The movie is a powerful depiction of war and how it can affect a person's choices. The cinematography is also beautiful and especially Zbigniew Cybulski is great in his role. [Here](http://www.criterion.com/current/posts/826-ashes-and-diamonds)	and [here](http://www.criterion.com/current/posts/363-ashes-and-diamonds)	are two interesting smaller essays about it at Criterion's website which gives some more insight. </TEXT>
