	<TITLE> Best toilet </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-07-11 22:16:36 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> We need a new toilet because i've spent way too much money on trying to figure out how to fix it and have come up with failed attempts. 

So... I need a new toilet! Less than $300 and preferably one that wont have any problems with clogging and is elongated.

Terrylove.com seems to recommend toto alot. Do you recommend that or something else?

We have an American standard that has been great for years but lately it just takes multiple flushes for everything to go through. We have used an auger, used pumic stone to remove any scale, and nothing that helped. So instead of wasting anymore money I think I must buy a new one. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I say it was bombed in the indian ocean and they're covering it up. But literally between India and China.
Why? There was an article about a lady who saw debris off a plane in the ocean from her flight. She reported it but the search was never concluded in the area she mentioned afaik. 
Now im going to speculate and say that this plane was headed for one of the stans via india. And india wasnt going to let some lunatic fly and danger its people so they bombed it or maybe malaysia bombed it. Now if india did bomb it and that information was disclosed than china and india would be at war. Something no nation wants.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So apparently I have 49k in student loans. Its been four years since i have graduated and the main reason I guess I wasnt as aggressive in paying off my student loans was because I bought a car (audi a4) which just took all of the money. Thankfully I paid it off so now I should have more money to pay off student loans but it seems like it will take forever.

So how long did it take you guys   gals to pay off your student loans and how did you save up for a house, etc? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I completed the one year bible few years ago and i so agree with u on this. The whole trying to finish the bible for the sake of it does not help u at all besides saying u "finished" reading the bible. 
If u do however do it that way than at least dont restrict urself from reading it in one year. Lol it made me very depressive because it took me much longer than i thought it would take and it just made me feel dumb. 

That said, i have read the bible multiple times. And i would say that the best way to read it is understand how the bible is categorized, and see which category interests you. And then pace yourself through it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I absolutely love the red letters for what Jesus spoke.

You know what would be cool? How about what God spoke in Blue?

i dont like references. It just gets in the way of reading the passage. And i absolutely cannot stand that there are no gaps at the left and right of the pages. I understand bibles need to be minituarized but there should still be some space.

Make paragraphs. Alot of time ur just reading a constant group of text. It would be great if paragraphs could be added. I see it as a positive thing for grouping content, supporting contextual reading, and lastly offering people the optiong to pace through the text. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My mom has a pinched nerve and i believe a bulge near her l4 l5. Her recent doctor recommended that she get only a sitting job.
I dont think her current employer has a sitting job and she is 58 and has constantly complained about her lower back. She is currently in short term disability and does have long term disability insurance.
Whats the procedure for getting long term disability?
And also does she qualify?
Im worried that if we go to the companys HR and ask then they might lay her off eventually if they see that she has this problem. </TEXT>
