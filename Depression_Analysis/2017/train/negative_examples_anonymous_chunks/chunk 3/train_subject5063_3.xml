Apparently the ONLY articles that are acceptable about global warming on this about are the ones that fall into lockstep with your Nazi-like beliefs on the subject and all other views are to be shouted down. Tell me, are Republicans not going to investigate the what they believe are the fudging of the numbers from NASA? If not show me where that is proven false. Whether or not NASA has done so or not is beside the point. The Republicans ARE in fact going to investigate those claims. And this sure as Hell relates to global warming. 

So fuck off and ban me if you can't rationally deal with opposing points of view.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I interviewed for a sales job I really want and they wanted me to go meet with four of their sales people. I thought the interview went great. After meeting with them they all had high praise for the company making me want to work there all the more. The sales people I talked to said that I needed to keep following up and that the mgrs I interviewed with would assume that anyone that didn't follow up didn't really want the job. I mailed two hand-written thank you notes two days after the interview and sent email follow-ups after each two sales people I met with. The problem is that I have since left several voicemails with no return and when I did get ahold of one of them he said he was on his way to a meeting and would call me back. (He didn't). 

Am I wrong or is this a total dick move on their part? I don't have a month to waste professing my love and chasing this company.  </TEXT>

TheseNegroes, theyre getting pretty uppity these days and thats a problem for us since theyve got something now they never had before, the political pull to back up their uppityness.

"the NBC anchor was nowhere near that aircraft or two other Chinooks flying in the formation that took fire." The report cited interviews with "crew members on the 159th Aviation Regiment's Chinook that was hit by two rockets and small arms fire." It said "Williams arrived in the area about an hour later on another helicopter after the other three had made an emergency landing."
