	<TEXT> Think of how obscured your vision gets when you cross your eyes. Thats only a few degrees "out of whack" if the orb of the eye was removed (but remain attached) your brain would have a very difficult time indeed, making sense of the information coming from both eyes.  
Given enough time, (and keeping a constant angle between the eyes) your brain would eventually "figure out" how to put the disparate information together to re-form a whole binocular picture. People with extremely "Lazy" eyes typically have mostly normal vision, but need a couple weeks to "relearn" to see after corrective surgery.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I dont know about the tone sweeps, or echoing "sonar style" tones (Sounds like star trek original series SFX, actually) the pulsing static noise sounds a lot like interference from a cellphone reaching out to a tower.  

  
When you recorded this, were you charging a cellphone? Perhaps somewhere close to a cell dead zone? </TEXT>
