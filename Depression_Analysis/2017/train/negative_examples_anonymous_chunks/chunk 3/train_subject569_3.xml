	<TITLE> To have sex or not to have sex? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-07-19 04:08:51 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> That is the question. So... I don't know what it is but when I go on NoFap streaks, around the second or third week (at least this has been true the 2 times I've made it this far), I find myself having women very attracted to me. It's weird, when I fap, I can't get shit, and right now, I have several women who are very into me. The only thing I'm afraid of is that if I have sex and ejaculate I'm going to lose this thing that's so attractive... My mojo per se. If it were with a single partner I might not be as afraid, but it's several women that want to meet me and I want to fool around with all of them (not all at once, but like, screw one in the early evening and one later that night), I'm just afraid I won't have the mojo I have right now after I have sex. Thoughts? Advice? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's really sad. I used to be very pro-choice.. And I still am pro-choicem just not nearly as much... I don't go around saying yes, go abortion, because I think it's so sad. I remember a debate I saw once where somebody said, if abortion is murder, masterbation is genocide, but then somebody rebuttled with, the difference between the sperm in a sock and a fertilized egg, is that the sperm will never grow up to be a person like you or I. And that really got to me... I hate abortion... I wish the government would pay people not to have them or something.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So here's my dilemma. I'm about 10 days into my current nofap streak, and I feel amazing. I really think this not ejaculating business really helps keep me sharp. I've been feeling amazing. But one of my biggest motivators to do nofap is because when I am fapping I never get laid... But now, tonight, I have 3 different girls who are literally asking me to come have sex with them within the next 24 hours. I would give these girls 7+ (almost 8s)... But it's more than I ever get.... But... I... I just don't want to. But I do. But I don't. But I do. But I don't.... I told one of them already, I'm more interested in a relationship than a hook up, so I'm very confused. I think I'd rather not have the sex. But yeah... I don't really know how to say that. That I want to date and not hook up.... It's weird / hard.... 

On a somewhat related note, I saw a music video tonight of a girl that was so gorgeous, like a 9.9/10 physically, and it made me want to fap so fucking bad but I didn't because I know it would take me further from my goal of being with a girl like that, and it made me feel almost hopeless. Currently, I hate my body so much. I'm about 20 pounds overweight. I used to be about 70 pounds overweight, but i've been working at this diet shit so long that it just kind of hurts. I want to be stunning. I want to look like those guys on the cover of magazines. It's just... It's mother fucking hard, and I'm super fucking jealous of those guys who are there and I don't know when I'll be there. I love shitty foods so much, that I need a pleasure release somewhere. It used to be weed, then sleeping, then masterbation, now food. It's hard to change your diet completely because even if I'm eating healthy, I want to eat a lot of what I'm eating. Like i'll have 3 fucking pineapples, not just half of one... Or the whole box of whole wheat pasta, not just a single serving... Anyway... What do you guys think of hard mode vs. easy mode? I feel like easy mode doesn't give you half the benefits... In fact, I know it won't... I'm not gonna have sex with any of these girls.

Thoughts? Advice? Help?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey guys! Fellow Fapstronaut here. I wanted to make you guys aware of a 100% NoFapping forum (I know of other forums with NoFap threads, but not a forum dedicated strictly to NoFap). It's not my site and I don't know any of the owners or anything so I'm not trying to pimp out my own site or anything. The reason I'm telling you guys about it is because after having been here on this subreddit for almost 5 months, I feel like this is a great tool and resource but it lacks a community and user familiarity aspect which a forum can bring. I joined last night and was hoping some of you awesome fapstronauts could come join so we can get some good discussions going and get to know each other so we can push each other and help each other really achieve our NoFap goals. I'm user Water2Funk, so feel free to message me and stuff. I really hope some of you guys join because, as great as this place is, the forum will really help us get to know each other and help us support each other with this journey and struggle. God speed Fapstronauts! 

link to forum: http://www.nofappers.org/forums/forum.php

edit: there's also yourbrainrebalanced.com which somebody just messaged me about... but why not join both...? the nice thing about nofappers is there is an off topic forum too. :)  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm thinking of back in the SNES days when you could play Donkey Kong Country against a friend by seeing who could beat the game first. First you would play the level, then your friend would have different colored clothing and play the same level. I know New Super Mario Bros. allows you all to play on one team, but I don't really enjoy it. Thanks for the input.  </TEXT>
