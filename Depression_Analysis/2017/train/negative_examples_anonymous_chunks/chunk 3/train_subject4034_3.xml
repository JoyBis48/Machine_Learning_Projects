	<TEXT> I once wrote a 15,000 page story 3 separate times, in first, second, and third person respectively. Finally I realized that I liked it best in third person, but that I needed to rewrite it AGAIN. I think in the end, I kept about 100 words of the roughly 50,000 I initially wrote. 

The silver lining is that the story thrived from the endless editing, and is now a published piece of fiction.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> John Keats is a poet from 200 years back. He's an interesting guy, and Hyperion gets its namesake from one of his poems. This book takes a VERY interesting twist on him. 

Also, the book is chronological.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ayn Rand is a wizard with a plot, but her writing is grueling. 

Ender's Shadow is brilliant, as well as the entire Hegemon series. I have a sneaking suspicion you'll be hearing a lot more about this book after November hits.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The first book is about a pilgrimage to an abandoned planet, and each of 7 chapters is told by a different pilgrim. Each subsequent book takes a different narrative approach, but all of the characters remain the same. On a side note, if you're at all a John Keats fan, this is a can't miss.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Check out Hyperion by Dan Simmons. It's a 4 book series that runs through about 7 narrators, but each of them have a compelling story and they all come together flawlessly. One of the best (and most underrated) series around.  </TEXT>
