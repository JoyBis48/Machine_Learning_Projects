	<TEXT> How is it clickbait? Clickbait is something that makes you click with the sole purpose of driving up ad revenue. 

THe article is from the Smithsonian Magazine which is hardly a clickbait site. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you want to see how U.S. counties have changed over time then this is your vid. You'll need to show it full screen to really see the changes.

Most telling to me is just how fluid the west has been . I assume part of that has to do with population growth but I wonder what other factors there are. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Search for trends in the dialogue of thousands of movie and TV shows, based on subtitles from Open Subtitles
Bookworm is like a lot of other word frequency sites. But unlike most, it directly incorporates links to every text searched, so you can actually see what drives changes; and it lets you customize the corpus so you can exclude texts that aren't interesting to you. 
This particular instance looks at movies and TV shows. Genre, location and language information from the Internet Movie Database textfiles. Click to see the movies/TV shows where the matches are found.
For some caveats, explanations, and examples, see the accompanying blog post. 

It's interesting seeing the trend over time of words. For example I put in "horse" and "car" to see how the trend looked over time. Unsurprisingly the use of the word "car" has gone up and "horse" has gone down. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I still don't think that it could penetrate the side. Armor thickness only describes part of the characteristics of modern armor. Modern armor isn't just steel like tanks of old. 

If it hit the rear then I could imagine it could disable it.

But, as mentioned below, there's little chance of a WW2 tank getting the draw on a modern tank with it's sophisticated targeting systems.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't think that's true. The depleted uranium armor on the M1 has a a projected thickness of an estimated thickness of about 610mm. The 8.8cm KwK main gun of the Tiger I could only penetrate 138mm of armor at 100 meters. It could only penetrate 171mm at 100 meters.

Edit, the Tiger II main gun could only penetrate a max of 202mm.
