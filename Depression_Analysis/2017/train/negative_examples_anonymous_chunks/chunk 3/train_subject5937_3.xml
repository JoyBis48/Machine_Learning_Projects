First, we did not have adequate numbers to examine suicide trends in some specific subgroups 

Second, changes in cause of death coding might have affected our findings, 

Third, the study was not designed to determine whether changes in suicide rates in black and white children corresponded to periods of change in risk factors for suicide. 

Fourth, it is **unknown whether the accuracy of classification of a death as suicide in children has changed during the study** </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The purpose of the student loan is to provide future benefit (the fruits of the education). Since the ex-spouse will not be able to participate in the future benefit, both statues and court rulings state that, in general, student loans within a marriage are individual debts, not joint debts. There are exceptions, but that is the rule.

Example: If my wife puts me through medical school with $250,000 in student loans, then after 6 years of marriage I divorce her, she does NOT have to pay any of the loans since they will only benefit me - - via future income. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't think so. If that were the case, you would commit a crime if:

I email you child porn as an attachment (the image would be on your PC)

I sneak onto your PC and download the file "train_subject5937 Child Porn" that contains illegal images.

In both cases, the illegal child porn is on your PC, but you have no intent and have not committed a crime - - but I would have. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The intent and the individual's actions are very different in the two cases.

1. If Googling "impact of child porn on society" resulted in images being cached, it would be hard to prove intent to download the illegal porn.

2. If in addition, you right click on the child porn and "save image as", then you have clear intent. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  if you search for it and you see the image hosted on a website 

The Google Search would be within your browser (not actually going to another website). Now, if the browser caches the images to your hard drive, and they remain there, that might be a gray area if a search of your PC was done and they were found. I think you could beat the charges since, by doing a Google search with your browser, you did not intend to, and did not actively download the pictures.

I don't think finding child porn would be illegal. DOWNLOADING it would be illegal. Thus, the search would not be a crime, the act of downloading it would.

	<TEXT> I think there is a distinction between being a crime, and supporting criminal charges.

1. Clearly a search could be evidence in support of criminal charges (e.g. "how to dissolve a body with lye")

2. Under the Patriot Act, repeated searches on the President's travel plans, combined with searches to hire an assassin, etc. might be prosecutable.  

Other than the Patriot Act or threats on the President, I have a hard time seeing when a search, or even a pattern of searches would be a crime. </TEXT>

 64% say they pray more than once a day.

 56% say they most often pray for family members, with 3.3% saying that they pray for strangers.

 A little over 38% say that the most important purpose of prayer is intimacy with God.

 41% say that their prayers are answered often.

 1.5% say that their prayers are never answered.

 Over 73% say when their prayers are not answered, the most important reason is because they did not fit Gods plan.

 5% say that they pray most often in a house of worship.

 79% say that they pray most often at home.

 67% say that in the past six months, their prayers have related to continually giving thanks to God. (Pastors Weekly Briefing, 12/24/04)
