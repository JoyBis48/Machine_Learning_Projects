	<TEXT> God damn, just spent all this time trying to install it, finally I install the damn thing, then the network adapter is being a complete dick. It says it's in there somewhere, but whenever I run ifconfig, wlan0 isn't there, there no enable wifi in the connections menu, and it's not doing anything. ugh.

Edit: fixed after running around with an ethernet cable :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Already got Debian, Kali and Ubuntu in a VM :D I was just unsure whether or not to go for a dual boot. I think I'm going to use Windows as gaming / production boot, and Ubuntu Linux as personal / files / general internet browsing :D I love the fact how secure Linux is, and how you can set it up to do anything! </TEXT>

Run it, and then click on Summary to the left, then click file  save as text  open it up  copy and paste the bit under Summary, all the way down to Audio. And post it to us.
