	<TITLE> Please don't upvote - I need a liquid that wont rust guitar strings or ruin the fretboard. </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Like the title says, I need a liquid or gel-like substance that will lubricate the fretboard without rusting the stings or ruining the neck and frets with prolonged usage. Something that wont drip or run down the guitar would be great.

Edit: Thanks for all of the helpful information! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've been playing on a tiny map with 22 civs and all the land that can be claimed already has been, even the oceans. So I was wondering what happens to border growth when there's nowhere to go? Does it count towards culture? It is useless now? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The title says it all really. I've know that Mexico City has lots of museums and I'm looking forward to those. Sorry this is so vague right now, I wrote it in a hurry. 

Edit: I'm looking for anything that might have to do with music, traditional music preferably, and also I'm interested in fruits from Mexico that might not be readily available in the united States. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I mean what is the best invention that makes our lives somewhat easier?
Just some examples of the type of things I mean: scissors, band-aids, pens... simple objects. Sliced bread was first produced in 1928, so anything made after that is fair game. </TEXT>
