And it doesn't help that my girlfriend (30) just recently discovered she likes to party (drink, hang out at bar, stay out all night w/out me, and I do mean all night - talking 0600 return) and it's really stressing our relationship a lot.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ok, OP, so you asked for advice on how to achieve in a career and you got a few folks bragging about their salaries.  Sorry about that.  I won't do the same.

I'm not in software but the general principles are the same.  Perform well at every level and go outside your required duties.  Take extra tasking on that would not typically be expected of you.  Let people know you're interested in new and different opportunities, even if they may seem outside your area of expertise.  Maintain networks of folks you've done work for - you never know when you might need or benefit from a reference.  Take training opportunities that come your way.  Make yourself invaluable.  Learn things that are new and exciting, or old and fading away.  Things that are out there in the world need to be maintained, just as much as the new things need to be created.  Strive to do better on every assignment then you did on the last.  If something's due on a particular date, get it done early.  Anyway, that's what I have for now. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 13 years can add a lot of perspective.  And I was feeling pent up.  The shitty thing about coming out is that it's something you do for your whole life, again and again. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A non gender specific pronoun would be something like "they"...not partner.  But I get your point.  My point is simply, don't expect to get away with that for long as people notice it taking an effort to maintain.  Intelligent people, anyway. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Uh...it was hardly a backdoor pilot.  A backdoor pilot is when you have the folks on NCIS travel down to New Orleans and then the week after NCIS: New Orleans starts.  Or when the guys on JAG go talk to NCIS and the hour after JAG is when NCIS has its first episode.  Or when the Originals of TVD travel down to New Orleans to get into fisticuffs and then next week "The Originals" starts...It's when a show uses another show's setting and varies the circumstances slightly to spin off another show. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Lived and worked there for ten and a half years out of college until last August.  Being in the middle of nowhere brings it's own unique benefits and complications.  And it's so often windy.  That really got on my nerves as a cyclist and a motorcyclist.  The average wind is higher than the highest winds at Pax, for example.  But at the same time if you're outdoorsy there's plenty to go and do.  But plan to be out of town on weekends otherwise plan to be bored.

Feel free to shoot me a message if you have specific questions. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Um..no. Unless of course if you're referring to how I typically see other people.

My comic would look like this:
First panel, "On the first day god created nothing, because he doesn't exist."
Second panel: Just a sound cloud with the word "poof!" in it.
No third panel. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I saw this article the other day...It seems like you have to purchase a subscription?  Also, it's sending the recorded audio up to a server if I understood it correctly, and finally, ideally it needs to be installed on the phones of everyone you're hanging out with.  It's a neat idea I will admit but the implementation is challenging. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's not the Note, it's your headunit.  My G3 does it in my car (FR-S) but not in my girlfriend's car (Hyundai Sonata).  It's a "feature" of Android that Google refuses to fix and no one seems to be able to find a workaround.
