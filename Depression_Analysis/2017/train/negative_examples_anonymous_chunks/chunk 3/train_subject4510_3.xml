	<TITLE> Editing headshot for background </TITLE>

	<TEXT> I hope this is the correct place. I'm a Realtor ... in Virginia as my name has given away. I've noticed a few photos, including one we have at our disposal, can be used on flyers and websites where only the picture is shown. No background or blank space so if you place a different colored background, there is not a square or block. The one example I have is we have a company logo with a .png format that can be placed on anything and it's only the Logo, no block or white background. What exactly is this called? And can you do it with a mac with basic software, no photoshop etc.? I would really like to do it with my headshot and some additional logos (Realtor logo etc.)

I'm sorry for my lack of knowledge and probably terrible description but any help would be welcome. Also is there any companies that do ? 

Thank you </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You should never negotiate for repairs to be done after a closing. It's always wise to have the repairs re-inspected by a professional after repairs are made, thought I won't lie, I don't always recommend that if it's only a few hundred dollars of repairs. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I know this is purely speculation but I'm just curious, what do you think will be the ceiling of the GTAT stock if Apple released that the sapphire will be used on ALL iPhones and the upcoming iWatch.

Once again I know it's speculation but curious peoples responses that are much wiser then me.  </TEXT>

I think that this was the first episode that really made me enjoy the story as a whole. Before this episode, even though it felt like some of the story lines were coming together, they still felt mostly frayed.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I could go on for hours about the death of Gladys. My girlfriend doesn't get home for an hour, and I'm just sitting in silence mind fucked. 

Why did they kill Gladys? Did they really kill Gladys? What does it say about Gladys that she was begging for her life during the stoning? Did Gladys death really do that much good? Wtf is Patti saying 99% of the time? Why was it so important for her to die? Why did Kevin have to understand THAT way?  WHY, WHY, WHY!?! </TEXT>
