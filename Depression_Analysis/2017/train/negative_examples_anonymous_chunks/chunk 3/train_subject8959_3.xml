	<TEXT> I'm not sure they are thinking clearly. I imagine they are working brutal hours due to overall shortage of staff. International workers and Red Cross have been attacked several times by locals and it's scaring off volunteers. Those that braved it are wearing themselves down.

I'm a nurse and I feel like more should volunteer to get down there and help contain this, but I have a family and take the easy way out. I still feel this has potential to get very very horrible.

I hope the doctor makes it through. :( </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I like to take it one step further. Since energy is infinite, time is irrelevant. Everything energy will be or can be/has been currently exists at once. We interpret the state we're in based on perception of our current existence, but that's our nature. That doesn't make time as we understand it a natural law.

If we were to perceive this infinite energy in its true form, we'd see the state of everything we know to exist as simply varying forms of the same energy. Everyone around you are simply different states of you. You are every single person who has ever been, currently lives and who will ever be. Along with every single other "living" thing. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I didn't ask what caused it. I asked how to lessen it. In my former life as a nurse, I saw hundreds of gallons of various fluids thrown away in sealed rubber bags. Bags that are not going to biodegrade in your grandchild's lifetime. This is daily.

My question is, over the course of years, decades, that kind of resource abuse is a zero-sum game. 

But a good friend of mine who is a devoted Tea Party member completely agrees with you and said almost your exact argument. I just feel like it fails to touch on the issue of preservation.

We recycle aluminum. We separate plastics at the bin. We take absolutely no steps to preserve water or reintroduce it into our ecosystem, which I feel is a misstep. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks everyone, I appreciate the feedback. He is nearing middle school age. The divorce was years ago, I can't even imagine her discussing me publicly knowing how many times we've been to court. I'm going to try the pro bono avenue, I've tried before and I get many rejections based on wages.

Any attempt to return to court from position of plaintiff fails on my part, they don't listen or take me seriously in any real regard. It's hard to get into details, but essentially the relationship between a counselor and the judge in my case wound up costing me. I disagreed with the counselor regarding her attempt to medicate my son (I work in healthcare and knew a licensed counselor was not legally allowed to recommend medications for my son), so I requested a new counselor and suddenly she testified that I didn't listen to medical advice and bam, lost medical rights over my son. This was followed by my ex immediately filing and stating that if I disregarded medical advice, then my son wouldn't be safe traveling to my place. Ta da. 

A frustrating aside, the divorce started when I caught her cheating with a man 20 years older, who was both of our boss in the civilian military contract we both were working at the time. She denied this in court, I presented evidence she lied. That's how she lost, as she was proven to be unreliable in court. But the moment this counselor and I disagreed, the entire game changed. Just incredibly frustrating how biased the family court system is in favor of the mothers, but in this case I am convinced there is a loophole or a crack I've been overlooking that could help me.

Thanks again everyone. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> After my divorce in West Virginia, I moved to Baltimore MD. The courts had ruled 50/50 custody. My ex repeatedly dragged me to court for every single reason you can imagine, and each time I won until the final court case, case number 9, where she said my sons mental health was impaired because of the travel to see me. Out of money and representing myself, I lost that single case and she gained majority custody.

My ex has completely stopped letting me see or contact my son and I cannot get the courts to act. I am still paying a large sum in child support and live paycheck to paycheck with my current wife and our baby, even though she is married to someone retired from military and they own three houses. The fact that she has children with her new husband was considered a hardship by the judge in our case and I had an additional 10 percent added to my final monthly child support.

I just want to see my son. I have no money, at all, to hire another attorney. I've burned through every dime I had in court costs. I won 8 consecutive cases. I have tried appeals, they were overturned. The judge told me to get a lawyer. I make too much to qualify for legal aid but my wages are on paper. In reality, I have a family to support and I'm struggling.

Anyone with any suggestions, please let me know. I literally have no idea what I can do now. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 1) What timezone do you live in and what hours do you normally reddit? DC area, all day typically off and on. 

How many hours a week do you normally use reddit? 20+

2) Where have you moderated before? Game and music forums mostly, including the XBOX Addicts forum, dnbmp3, soulseek 'music', OKCupid and long ago dogsonacid

What do you like and dislike about moderating? I like interacting with people and helping solve problems. I do not care for having to sift through endless pictures of genitals.

If you could ask the admins to change one thing about moderating, what would it be? Bundled HTML notifications via email are always useful

3) What does AskReddit need to change? Less repeat questions is a big one

How would you improve AskReddit by being on the team? Actively search history, plus I am here enough that I recognize the repeats and questions that feel "common"

4) A post goes up and your gut says that it breaks the rules but youre not sure which rule it breaks. What do you do? Research. If that doesn't turn up a good solution, then I ask someone who may know (another mod)


5) Why is rule 5 important? Objectivity is important. This should be a place to share knowledge, not rant and rave. There's better places for that. No exceptions.

6) Why is rule 6 important? Should there be exceptions made? If so, what? There are more suitable subreddits for that. No exceptions.

7) Do you agree with the expansion of rule 8? I agree so long as it remains in genuine good faith adherence to the community spirit and not some personal act of spite against a particular user.

9) What do you consider to be a bannable offense? Blatant trolling, repeating a question despite the question being removed and harassing other users are significant issues.

10) Youre a new mod and you see another mod make a banning that you dont think is justified. What do you do? Stand behind the moderators decision and expect they stand behind decisions I make. If there's a REALLY strong case for "wrongful banning", I'd shoot them a PM voicing my concerns then let them make the final call.
