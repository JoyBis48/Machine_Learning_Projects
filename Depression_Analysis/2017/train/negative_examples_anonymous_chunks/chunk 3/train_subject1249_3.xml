	<TEXT> There needs to be a serious rewrite of rules regarding the application of use of force by police officers.  Any unauthorized use of force beyond that the proper rules of engagement can result in felony prosecution.  Once you get start jailing cops on mass for excessive force, than you will see these type of incidents.

If I were a prosecutor, I would have zero tolerance for this behavior especially if there is no real or perceived threat engaged by the officer.  The officer should be charged with misdemeanor assault.  He should not lose his job, but he will have a misdemeanor on his record for assault. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In my job market, I am beginning to partially "give up" my job search.  There is enough work at my local Labor Ready to get at least 32-40 hours a work.  Yes, it is grunt work, but at least there is work.

Most of the problem with people "giving up" exist in small labor markets with limited job opportunities in very limited jobs.  There is only so many grunt jobs/minimum wage jobs to go around.

The flaw in the Republican thinking about not extending benefits is to understand the job markets where there is abundance of low-wage jobs that are easy to get and job markets where there is limited low-wage jobs and there is huge competition for those jobs.

The other issue is that most one-stops center job counselors lack the proper training to teach job-searchers proper job search strategy.  Most of people need to taught how to network outside their comfort zone and how to develop large contacts of people.  The one-stop center really lack the in-depth training to use these resources. </TEXT>

I can do that especially in an area of abundance of recovery homes until I find a room to rent.  Not everybody can relocate very quickly and very fast.  And a lot of people do not want to move away from their families and friends just to live near where they work just to avoid to paying a tax. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> People that habitual drunk driving laws should be subject to felony convictions if they commit at least four drunk driving charges in ten years.  Once they get more than four DUIs in ten year, each subsequent DUI is a felony.  Eventually, the subject offenders will get nailed by the habitual offender laws in their states and will face stiff jail time (like 15+ years in jail for DUI).  If a person commits habitual DUIs over a long period of time, but does not commit four in a ten year window, should not subject to be a felony law. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The only way to end the problem is the enacting the Sherman Anti-Trust Act and tax, tax, and more tax until the corporate are banks are broken into dozens and dozens of regional and local banks that invest directly into the local and regional economies.  Our regulators are afraid of enacting a massive Sherman Anti-Trust act against the banks to break them up into dozens and dozens of large regional and local banks that are force to compete against each other instead of engaging in massive collusion.  This is the real free-market capitalism and not crony monopoly capitalism. </TEXT>
