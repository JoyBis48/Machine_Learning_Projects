	<TEXT> Stormreaver and Korgath are the two servers I played on.  My mage was in Death and Taxes   TFO on Korgath during TBC.  Both of those servers were focused on high progression, and were very high population pvp servers.  I semi-quit during Cataclysm, so it's been a while since I've played seriously at any level.  Dungeon/Raid finder basically removed most of my friends because they logged in, queued for DF/RF, and logged out for the week.  All of my friends became disinterested in hard modes or even normal modes for that fucking matter, because they had already seen all the content...that's all they wanted to do after all.  So I was left on a progression server, with nobody wanting to do progression because they already saw all the content!

That's my huge gripe with ezmode raids; a large portion of the population just wants to see what's new and then not go any further.  At least when that content was locked out, they were eager to earn the rights and the ability to go into that content to prove their worth.

Did it eat a lot of time?  Yeah.  But it made those accomplishments all that more worth while. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They did take 310% away. [[Proof]](http://www.wowhead.com/achievement=2144/what-a-long-strange-trip-its-been#comments:id=1695700) Turns out that in 4.0.1 they just simply gave it to _everyone_ and anyone with a 310% mount immediately got the master riding skill to accompany it without having to purchase it.

Also, people _did_ give a flying rats ass, I know because I'm not so short-sighted to forget the absolute awe that I felt when someone rode up to me on an epic mount for the first time.  Most of the population of WoW did indeed care; the whispers that I got _constantly_ over my gear are a testament to that.  Just because you never reached that level (because of lack of skill, or lack of social skills, whatever) doesn't mean that there wasn't a bit of extravagance to having that gear. </TEXT>

When people get the same art on their gear, as I do on mine, but in a slightly different color then yeah; I feel cheated.

If you walked around with Naxx gear on a server back in Vanilla, you were hot shit.  You got to show that off.  Now?  Nope.  Everyone's got the same fucking gear, with a different color (at most)

I'm actually really glad that they took 310% riding away from players who did the holiday achievements for a year.  I got mine by doing hard mode Ulduar, and put a lot of work into it - I got to hang onto that permanently, and that feels good. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you!  Someone who actually understands how heat sinks work!  You can't just put thin fins 20 inches high and get any radiative effects.

You've got to have a thick base, with enough metal to literally sink the heat into (hence the whole heatsink name!).  Then you've got to have fins that aren't so thin that they won't conduct heat away from the block.

And on passive heat sinks, you rely on convection of the air being heated up in order to generate the breeze that a fan would normally.

Additionally, for a peltier - you're going to want something with heat pipes, that rely on the phase change of a liquid inside to increase efficiency. </TEXT>

How about reading steps 3 and 4?

3.Partition the destination disk into partitions with sizes greater than copied data and should be of same format and same flags using gparted. Please google how to partition a disk.

4.Now mount the freshly formatted and partitioned disk. Mostly you need to just connect the disk to system and you can find the mounted partitions in /media folder. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I have the task of copying a master image of an 8gb SD card, over to hundreds of other SD cards.  The problem is that the cards vary in size (a couple mb smaller or larger than a full 8gb), and some of the windows utilities just simply refuse to write the image if the card is smaller.

I'm trying to grab an image of the card, minus anything at the "end", so that the image I'm writing is like 7.5gb, instead of the full 8gb.  I can't seem to find a straightforward way of doing this.

I've tried copying the first 512 (mbr/partition table) and then concatenating it with the partition images, but I'm guessing that doesn't work because partitions need to be aligned to the blocksize.  (After writing the image, it won't boot)

I've already got the SD card image so that the partitions are resized and there is ~750mb free at the "end" of the drive (I say this because I'm aware how flash controllers don't write data sequentially). </TEXT>

They are run by a set of brothers who have been knowingly spamming across the entire internet attempting to get their 3D printing "property" (domains 3Dprint.com and 3dprintboard.com) to be worth more money.

Unfortunately a bunch of places picked up the story without verifying it, but be aware that it's likely completely fabricated. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you're using slic3r or cura as well; try out the support material.  It sounds like the print is oriented in such a way that it's trying to build a piece out in mid air, and it needs something to rest on that can be peeled away later.  KISSlicer isn't beginner friendly as far as UIs go; so use what you're familiar with first and determine if that's what you need for this print to succeed. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Skull above the teeth.  See that plateauing?  That's the result of your motor jumping to a full step position on the motor due to microstepping being unable to function for whatever reason.  Usually this is due to a mis-selected motor that's "rated" for 12v, and being powered by 12v.  For microstepping to work, we actually use motors rated for 2v or so, and run them at 12v, but chop the signal up so that there's not too much power going through the motor.  That allows us to get intermediate steps between the full 200 steps.  Gives us smoother lines, better resolution, etc. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well; depends.  What stepper motors are you using?  Ideally they should be "rated" for 2-4v   1.5-4ohm.  If the motors you're using say they are "rated" for 12v, and are 15-30ohm then simply swapping out for the correct motors will fix it.  Also, which machine is this on?  Kossel or Prusa i3?  If it's on the Delta; increasing your delta_segments_per_sec will help increase the quality of the print.  (Also able to create these types of patterning) </TEXT>

Are there any common cylindrical lenses which I can use in the housing to help shape the elongated beam into a sphere or would I be better off using a beam-mask before the focusing lens? </TEXT>

Also, are there any kind of open source electronics for maybe building a box mod?  If there's something like the eVic's internals, I'd love to fiddle with that.  Also, are there any reputable places which sell "eGo heads" or something similar for tinkering?

	<TITLE> List based push/pop state machine? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-04-29 04:00:29 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> A while back, maybe 2 years ago, I was working on a JRPG, but got caught up with state machines.  My hangup was getting everything modular and able to be extended properly, etc.  Yes yes, I know I know...typical move...jump into programming wanting to make a big project like an RPG; I fell right into that trap.

Recently, a post that included a link to here: http://hub.tutsplus.com/categories/game-design/articles/gamedev-6676-how-to-build-a-jrpg-a-primer-for-game-developers got me re-interested.

I was also interested in Python on Android at the time, and had basically gotten this far: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yKrlPS8J0fA

I had a character moving around on the screen, and was working on tilemapping.  The other thing I was working on, was a state machine, so I could break apart the game into different files (instead of one single file like I had been doing for so long).

I got as far as this: http://pastebin.com/mC5ugQcs

A year later, I'm back looking at the code, and also looking at the "How to Build a JRPG", and am noticing that it looks like I'm doing something similar to what his very first example of a state machine is doing.  A big problem also is that I used to understand the code before, but now I'm kind of flabbergasted by it.  I'm not sure how it works anymore (it was still a _little_ bit magic when I had help making it).  I understand what super() is doing, it's calling the inherited \_\_init\_\_ even though I've overridden it.  The problem I'm having is with the magic of StateManager.

I'd like to turn it into something like his second example, but the pseudo-code he's using is also throwing me for a loop, I'm not used to using map or what it does.  I like the idea of just having states that I can append to a list, and then pop off but is there a way to modify that list inside the scope of a class?  I fear using a global list is not the way to accomplish this.  I've also been kinda iffy about states returning other states...at some point wouldn't I hit a recursion limit?  I'd like to be able to pop the state off of the stack so it doesn't have to know what other point it came from or where it's going to.

Also, I would like to break this all into separate files, so a new state can be added by making a new file in a directory.  All I need to do for this is add an init.py in a subdirectory, and then import [subdirectory] right? </TEXT>

What's the cheapest I could get something like this?  Any shops have scrap and some extra time?  It could probably be CNC routed too, but there are a bunch of small holes, and would probably require extra setup.

I believe the plate is like 20" (500mm-ish) square and needs 6mm thick aluminum (or something close to that thickness anyhow) </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> FamiLAB, a hackerspace in the greater orlando area, is toying around with offering a semi-annual 3D printer workshop, in which you work with a bunch of other people, get assistance assembling a kit-based printer, as well as education on how they work, how to tune them, how to use the software, etc.

If there is an interest in such a thing, would $400 be something you'd be willing to drop a couple weeks in advance of the class/workshop?  The cheapest kits out there right now are $399 (currently the printrbot jr: http://printrbot.com/shop/printrbot-jr/) so you'd be getting quite a value with the help you'd receive.  The kit comes with a little bit of plastic to print with, and you'd leave with a fully working machine and a good understanding of it.

*edit:* Right now I'm unsure of how much time this would all take.  Would 4 hours for 2 days (total of 8 hours) be too long? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Looking for a suitable H-bridge (or Dual H-Bridge) driver for a remote control car project, but I don't want to spend $60 on an ESC because i'll be pairing it with a microcontroller anyways, and all of the ESCs I've run across already have an AVR built onto them.  What are my options for a  15A, 7-18v H-bridge?  I see millions of L298s floating around, and I even _have_ one of these packages, and it's not suitable for my purposes (overheats and goes into thermal shutdown).

Would an ESC still be a better option?  What chips would you recommend? </TEXT>
