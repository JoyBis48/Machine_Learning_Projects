	<TEXT> Went on a roundtrip through Greece with school. First weekend: Athens. We get to our hotel and find people are selling drugs out of cars in the front. There was a little terrace where people were shooting up heroine at 2 in the afternoon. We thought our school had been its cheapo self and got a hotel in a horrible neighborhood. Turns out we were about 2 minutes from the absolute center. LOVELY </TEXT>
