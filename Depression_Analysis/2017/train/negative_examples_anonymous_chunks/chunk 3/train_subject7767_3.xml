	<TEXT> The infinite thickness for gold is 10 microns. Gold plating is usually thinner than that. So our unit can see the underlying metal and give you a warning.  Even reaching the limit, it looks at the ratio between the M and L shell kEV cps and can also give you a warning.

Super engineered counterfeits can fool XRF for sure, but those are rare and costly to make.  What people are doing is getting stainless steel (austenitic aka doesn't respond to magnets), stamping them 18k and then going place to place to see if someone will buy it as white gold.  Stainless steel will pass the 18k scratch acid test, but it instantly shown on XRF to have no gold.  Same with grandma's jewelry.  People will swear up and down that this is a pure 18k gold ring that has been passed down for generations, but the XRF will spot regular plating and costume jewelry in 5 seconds or less.

XRF also helps you pay for exactly what you get when it is authentic.  14k gold should be 58.5% gold.  However, most of the stuff made in recent years is 55% gold.  So if your item passes the 14k scratch test, and you are paying out on 58.5% by weight, then you are losing money when you go to sell it to the foundry who will do an fire assay and get the correct %.

Most big pawn/coin shops will have an XRF unit.  Hardcore Pawn has 2 of ours that they use on the show occasionally.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm right in the butter zone.   Couldn't keep my unlimited data, but I'm not on the ones that up your rate if you do a 2 year thing.  I COULD save $20 or so by going to an EDGE plan and then having the phone be $25/mo for 24 mo.  But it's cheaper to get it subsidized and keep the current plan.  There is just a new 2 year contract and a ETF if it's canceled. like I said, I'm not going anywhere, so why should I spend $600 when I can spend $250? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> construction, plumbing, welding...any blue collar field, etc

Women can certainly do those jobs, but they tend to be much more physically demanding.  The average man can do those jobs and get worn out pretty easily after a day of work in training.  The average woman will have a far tougher time accomplishing the same job.

Not sure what best describes this, "free market" maybe?  Of all the blue collar jobs, I would think electricians would be best for both sexes.  Lifting some wire bundles and running up and down ladders should be just as easy for both. Unlike normal construction/framing.  That's a lot of weight you are always moving around.

My father built houses all his life.  He's so strong (even at 72) that he is faster on his own than most 2 man crews.  That Y chromosome comes in handy once in a while.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They are forced induction.  So they force more air into the engine.  If you can get more air in there, you can get more fuel (air to fuel ratio, or stoichiometry, says when the mix will ignite) .  More fuel = bigger bang.  Bigger bang = more power pushing the cylinder down.

Now how they function it's different between sc and turbo.  Turbo's use the exhaust to spin a turbine on one half of it, when then sucks more air in on the other side.

Super chargers use the belts of the engine to drive the turbine (or other type).  Supercharged cars usually have no delay or lag between when you hit the has pedal, while turbo suffer from turbo lag from them taking some time to spool up to pressure.

You rarely see supercharged 4 cylinder cars, but 6+ cylinder can go either way.
