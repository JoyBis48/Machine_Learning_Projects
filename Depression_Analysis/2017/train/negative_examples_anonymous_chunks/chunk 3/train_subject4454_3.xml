	<TEXT> Ok, the gun by itself is not banned or illegal just the act of the transaction between the father and son because of his previous felony charge. 

It still would not matter because not only was the straw purchase done (illegal). Stealing the gun from the mother (illegal). Walking inside a Church in SC with a gun (illegal). No law or policy would have prevented the shooter to commit the act. In order for laws to work, criminals must follow them. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  After all, if they don't cover something when you're asleep, then how could their coverage be "24-7 since early in the morning yesterday"?

Replay. Happens all the time.

 If they can provide coverage for hours as soon as the event begins for a missing plane

The news broke during the day and so its easier and you have more time to tell people to stay in longer, make calls, cancel programming, and organize the rest of the news programming later in the day.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It has been 24/7 since early in the morning yesterday. The shooting took place at 9pm the night before. You know it sounds crazy, but people sleep at night and have scheduled hours to come in to work. </TEXT>
