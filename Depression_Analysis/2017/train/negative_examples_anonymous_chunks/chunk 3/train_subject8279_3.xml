	<TEXT> Male Nurse here. Stay away from drama. You can't change others,  just yourself. On the floor (medsurg) I remind myself why I'm here and focus on that. After a while, people start noticing your actions and stop complaining around you because they realize they sound like a whiny teen that didn't get their way. Sometimes I like to amuse myself and play devil's advocate for a situation that didn't go their way so they can put their ego to the side for a second.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> At the rate parents take pics of their kids and post on Fb. Then in their teens with selfies and such. Then when they're older the whole process repeats itself when they have kids. Not to mention they will be old and tech savvy.
