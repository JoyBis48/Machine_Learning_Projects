	<TEXT> This sting has more to do with marketing related bribes and kickbacks involving CONCACAF officials and marketing companies, such as Traffic. Much of this seems to be connected to tv and radio rights for matches and tournaments, including the 2014 World Cup.

Since CONCACAF is headquartered in Miami, the US has jurisdiction. It is not uncommon for the law enforcement authorities of different countries to work together. The fact that the Swiss authorities were willing to assist the US indicates just how fed up they are with FIFA in general.

As to why now - my understanding is that certain statutes of limitations were on the verge of expiring.

FIFA doesn't like governmental interference into its secret lairs. I've seen speculation that if Blatter wanted, he could suspend all of CONCACAF and take away the World Cup slots. Not sure how accurate this is, and not sure that FIFA would want to grab the bull by the horns like that.

I think DOJ's endgame is to root out corruption in CONCACAF and hold the sleazy folks that have been in charge accountable for their misdeeds.

What happened today isn't about the 2018   2022 World Cup bidding processes; however, the Swiss government has launched its own criminal proceedings into those matters. </TEXT>

That's the light hearted side, the dark side is how many people get ticketed or arrested on flimsy evidence that wouldn't hold up at trial but can't hire good legal help so take pleas cause it seems easier   quicker than fighting,   then find themselves f'd financially. "Just don't break the law," is pure navet. Oh, how about this poor guy - http://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/miami-dade/article1957716.html </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This isn't just a problem in the realm of truancy, it is a problem for a lot of low income people who get cited for various minor "quality of life" misdemeanors - loitering, public intoxication, being in a park after it has closed, etc. They get caught in a vicious circle of missing work due to arrest and court, already living paycheck to paycheck so can't pay fine, more court, maybe more jail, more work missed, there goes the job, etc. etc. etc. One of the big reasons that the federal judge shot down "stop and frisk" in the NYC public housing scenario was partly due to this happening to people who had no weapon and ended up getting summonses related to "quality of life" issues. The lead plaintiff in that case was arrested for trespassing at a public housing unit - he was waiting for his girlfriend who lived there and gave him permission to be there. The guy is a licensed security guard and the flimsy arrest, even without a conviction, could have seriously ruined his career. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I thought I read that only one of the dead was a Bandido, the other eight were Cossacks. Also, the impression I've gotten is that biker gangs will talk tough when it comes to the police, but in reality try to avoid violence against the police cause doing so will rain hell down upon them. MCs have clubhouses, clubhouses that are not well hidden. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A few years back when my house got robbed, a dog in the backyard did not prevent them from jumping the fence and kicking down the backdoor. And she wasn't a small dog, sadly she was super friendly. When I had a new door installed, they guy installed it in such a way that it will be extremely difficult to kick in. </TEXT>

I will say one thing that can be annoying here in Houston is how all the private security companies now have fleets of cars that look like police cars. Additionally, there are at least three communities (two very wealthy neighborhoods and one a commercial district) that hire off-duty LEO to patrol in vehicles those communities have furnished - and they seem to replace the cars more often than HPD. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not all government vehicles in Texas say "EXEMPT" on their plates, I've seen marked Constable vehicles with normal Texas plates. Pursuant to Texas Transportation Code 721.003 it is possible to obtain regular plates for exempt vehicles. While said section lists a bunch of specific entities, I assume that No. 18 is a pretty broad coverall for all other agencies. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sadly, it's getting harder and harder. A lot of unmarked vehicles will have officers with armor and polos or t-shirts, but it's easy for civilians to buy that stuff too. Hell, lots of police departments, especially in tourist areas, sell the t-shirts. I know the NOPD precinct office in the French Quarter has a t-shirt vending machine. </TEXT>
