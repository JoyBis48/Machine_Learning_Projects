	<TEXT> All these terms are just genaric now and thrown about willy nilly. they don't really mean someone is racist or a bigot or a hater. It's just pop culture. I lived in the south in the 80's in a small town, and saw real racisem hate and bigotry. If this guy stuck up for a gay, he meant well. Personally I am disgusted with all the polically correct language that is forced upon us. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It,s already happening here in the US. A few years ago there was a drought and Georgia was theatening to go to war with Tennessee over a shared lake on the border.Meanwhile the Gator-aid plant in Georgia continued to use million of gallons of water every day. It is  illeagal to harvest rain water in Colorado. Ever see a picture of the fabulous fountains in Vegas? A few miles down stream people are starving because what once was a river is now a muddy trickle. Where I live, companies are lobbying for the right to drill for gas by pumping thousands of gallons of chemicals deep into the ground and for up to  a quarter mile or so laterally.In pennsylvania, where this has gone on for a while, people can light their well water on fire and whole towns have been ruined. The gas comany will supply them with trucked in water while they drill, but after they move on they are fucked. This is just in the US,it is 100 times worse in third world countries and the propblem is not the population, it is the corperations. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well said, my bad on the Bucks.I hope someone reads this thread
besides you and I because that is another point,heat treating, cryo treating, forging vs stock removal,ancient method of burying the steel to rust then removing the rust,all these and more are valid points to study
if one is interested in knives. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Good point, I too have noticed "bragging rights" syndrome.
It's usually about brands, but what really bugs me is the whole
"super steel" thing. There is no super steel,different steels are made
for different purposes, period. D2 is good for a camp knife while 
carbon steel is better for a butcher knife,VG10 holds an edge forever
but if you use it to chop wood or bone it chips and takes forever to sharpen. 440c is a good all around choice used by Buck and many
custom makers for years. If it's well made and works it's a good 
knife IMHO. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My late dox-beagle,(Diesel?), Willy used to hang out under the porch.
One day a guy came walking past with 2 big red dobies,Willy came
charging out snarling and growling like a fucking rabid badger rocket ship.The dobies go into fight mode and turn to meet his charge,
Willy does this ninja side step,rolls and comes up underneath them snapping at their bellys then out the other side to snap at their asses.
Poor bastard holding the leashes was trussed up good by this time and I'm sorry-ing like a Canadian as I gather up my little "stretch- lowrider"
and put him in the camper where he got a chewy and a well deserved
ATTABOY!
