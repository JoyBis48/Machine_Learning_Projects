	<TEXT> It's actually incredibly logical. It's one of the most efficient ways to permanently harness power from a solar entity, and would permit a civilization to gradually scale its economic investment with its power needs. For instance, a younger spacefaring civilization would probably only require a Dyson ring, whereas a mature one would probably have a complete sphere which almost completely envelops the star, save for sustainability requirements. It also has the advantage of drawing power from the star without actually interfering with it and possibly invoking supernova, such as with a fusion solution.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is actually one existing concept of the multiverse. To summarize, Einstein discovered that there is actually no such thing as "distance" or "time" as independent concepts, it's actually one cohesive unit of measure known as "space-time". It's only when viewed from insignificant dimensions like ours that space and time have distinct characteristics. This space-time is considered to be the subsequent 4th dimension to our existing 3 dimensions of point, length and height/width. 

The gravity characteristics of black holes exhibit the limits of space-time, which is why it is often portrayed in science fiction as portals into another dimension. It is posited that beyond such limits lie the entrance to a higher dimension, which some theorize as the multiverse, whether through black holes or not. 

Like you said, an entity existing in a lower dimension will be unable to observe an entity existing in a higher dimension, e.g. if you existed in the 2nd dimension you would only be able to see in a line (i.e. left and right), but not up or down (i.e. in the 3rd dimension); hence if I were above you you would not know I was there even if I were right next to you. Similarly, an entity with access to the 4th dimension could exist and interact with us in the 3rd dimension without our awareness. So an entity bearing the characteristics of "God" as defined by popular culture could very possibly be a being in a higher dimension, and it would still be internally consistent with our present theories of science. </TEXT>

It's more useful to consider the cash flows in arriving at the final FCF figure individually, and form your own opinion on the aggregate cash flows.

	<TEXT> 1. It's not plus, it's multiply. The 2nd CoC is just an assumption that cost of capital will grow at a constant rate over time. 

2. Yes, it's because of that. The idea is that earnings growth can be expressed as an average of a large one-time number, whereas ROIC can't be window-dressed. Hence, his example of a poor acquisition demonstrates that growth numbers alone are illusory and can hide deeper symptoms which ROIC picks out. 

It's a pretty good article, and is one of the best attempts I've seen to provide a theoretical explanation for P/E. However, it still doesn't provide a perfect practical solution to the real world. As far as I've gathered, P/E doesn't seem to be grounded in any fundamental principle, it's just a reflection of sentiment to the share. </TEXT>

When one of their species accidentally dropped a lab culture on the barren asteroid Seerowpedia during one of their holidays, the resultant exposure spawned the first ancestors of what we now recognize as the Yeerks.  </TEXT>
