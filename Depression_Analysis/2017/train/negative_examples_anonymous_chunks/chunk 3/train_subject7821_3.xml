	<TEXT> just about every 'reality' TV 'star'

no one has ever been selected to be on a reality show for being a good person. 'let's gather the worst selection of ignorant, selfish, manipulative assholes   be entertained'. Survivor celebrates people who backstabs the most. Honey Boo Boo is terrible. who gives a fuck about a Kardashian? 

Still can't believe studios decide to marginally cast a show, barely create a script, rarely have to pay for sets,   make a killing in revenue off it...   there's a HUGE demographic of clueless viewers that don't care / tune in weekly. We're celebrating (making famous) people who exude the worst qualities in people   have no real talent.  </TEXT>

they should release the numbers of how much it cost of TxTag VS it's income. It's cheaper than last gen toll roads, but still costs a good bit with the cameras, the databases, etc... 

there's over a hundred people moving here a day, the roads are packed, surely there's other taxes we can use to pay for these (toll) roads which are everywhere yet not being used...  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Microsoft - Digital rights should work across all your devices: XBOX   Windows. 

It's apparent you're focusing your business on selling licenses: VIDEO / MUSIC apps   your marketplace. You're trying to get in on a major shift in media. People are turning from physical media to digital rights. You need to establish a better reputation than this. You are F'n Microsoft! 

When people buy from you, they need to know:

- the license is valid a lifetime for the user
- the license works across all your devices during that lifetime 

If you don't, you'll lose out to Sony, Amazon, Google, Apple, etc...   then you'll put out a press release like you always do saying 'now MSFT sees the light'... the market will speak. 

Your goal should be to retain users between upgrades, yet you've made several decisions to give established users reservations about your service.

I remember your mission statement being about synergy between products, but not anymore. 

EDIT: why do posts like this get downvoted? it's informative, it adds to the conversation, it's just an opinion...  b/c fanboys downvote things they disagree with (not what the button is for).
