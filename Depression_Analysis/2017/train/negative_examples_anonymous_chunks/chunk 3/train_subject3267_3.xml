	<TITLE> Taoism and Other People and The Law of the Jungle (a question) </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-10-18 05:55:11 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm somewhat new to Taoism and have arrived at a big question, or questions.

What I'm reading describes the uncarved block, and the watercourse way; basically, that nature is It. Nature is the One and only. Man should look to nature for the Way things are, and seek to live in harmony, and be united with, this Way. I'm clear on this insofar as nature is concerned. However, what about other people? Aren't other people full of all sorts of complications, delusions, misapprehensions, constructs, deceptions? If other people deviate from Nature, or the Way, aren't they outside it, or apart from it? Does Taoism include other people as part of Nature - because they may operate very differently than any sort of pure thing? Nature is lions eating antelope. Nature is the strong consuming the weak. Nature is the Law of the Jungle. Am I to assume that Taoism affirms this when it comes to people as well? What about the corrupt (politicians, banksters, mafia, etc.)? They deceive and devour anything in their way. Are they the lion, and thereby justified in their strength over the weak? Does might make right?  *What does Taoism say about this?*

And there is this from The Tao Te Ching:
"Nature is unkind: It treats the creation like sacrificial straw-dogs. 
The Sage is unkind: He treats the people like sacrificial straw-dogs."  Lao Tzu

So....this is *potentially* an aspect of Taoism that viscerally repels me - the amoral, "I'm going to charm you then eat you", Law of the Jungle aspect. Am I understanding it correctly? Is there anything I'm not getting? What would Chuang Tzu think of Bernie Madoff? Please give me any information or direction you might think useful. I WOULD REALLY APPRECIATE IT.

**TL;DR** Taoism is about nature, about the Way. This would include the lion eating the antelope, the Law of the Jungle. What about when it comes to other people? How are we to regard other people and their delusions and deceptions?  As part of nature? Does Taoism deem it natural to "eat" (notice the quotes) and conquer other people? What would Chuang Tzu think of Bernie Madoff?

**EDIT**  To clarify, I omitted the anecdote about the Taoist who betrayed me - to which most comments have been directed and which was obscuring my real questions. I'm not asking how I should have handled or interpreted the situation with my business partner as much as I am asking:  What does Taoism say about other people who betray and deceive, etc.?  Does it consider them a part of nature or not?  I would appreciate direct answers to this, if possible.  I want to learn about Taoism and am not seeking to process any event in my past. </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2014-10-13 23:51:05 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> From *Walking It Off*, by Doug Peacock:

"Ed Abbey had little use for organized religion but nevertheless believed there were observable guidelines for living, an accessible wisdom residing in the land, often tapped into by the native peoples, observing the natural world for the appropriate cycle of life.  Ed had always called the Taoist philosopher, Chuang-Tzu, the first anarchist.  Tao or Dao, means the Way or the Path, and this image (the nature of truth as trail) is far older than literature.  All ancient and traditional people had a Path and knew the seeking of the Way, and these instructions were often remarkable in their similarities.  It is the organic way for humans to know and think about their place on earth.  For Ed, the Way was wild nature, and the Path was a person walking in it utterly attentive.  That place was our original habitat, the wilderness, the Heart of the Lotus, and it was less a path than an off-trail bushwhack.  'When your mind is empty like a valley,' said Lao-tse, 'then you will know the power of the Way.'" </TEXT>
