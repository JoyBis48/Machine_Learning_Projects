	<TEXT> God I'm totally with you guys. I had a great day yesterday, ate healthy, worked out and figured I could do it again today...nope! Had projects galore pop up and will now have to skip working out, eat something fast and work until 9 to get it all done.

The only advice I have is to think of all the work you're getting done as one step closer to improving your life overall. I just log every major project and late night I have so I can bring it up during my review. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think about this same thing  lot too. I'm 28 and just hoping to stay healthy And alive long enough for those advances to start rolling in.I'm pretty optimistic though since the pace of technological growth is accelerating so rapidly. After the airplane was invented it took less than 50 years for man to break the sound barriers and then we walked on the moon in just a little more than 20 years after that.

So I think if I can hang in there for 50 years we will hopefully be at a point when life can be extended much longer. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree with a lot of your points. Triple Triad was probably my favorite mini-game in all the FF series. And I loved Balamb Garden as a setting. I think it would be awesome to have a game that used Balamb Garden as a setting and worked in simulation elements like in Persona 3.

But yeah the story was a little too confusing and the junction system could have been better. </TEXT>
