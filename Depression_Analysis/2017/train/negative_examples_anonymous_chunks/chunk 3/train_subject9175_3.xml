	<TEXT> IF you pay, they'll want more. If you refuse to pay, they'll expose you.

The best idea would be to waste their time. Slow down the process. Ask them questions about Western Union. Make excuses. Act confused. 

There is a chance they will just expose you anyway but the scammer knows he can only expose you once and so will be unlikely to give up on you if he just thinks you're incompetent.

	<TEXT> Aside from scam baiting them, there isn't a lot you can do. Depending on the country of origin, scam baiting CAN be effective in slowing down the swindlers.

If the scam came from Nigeria, chances are it's linked to organised time and all you'd be doing is wasting the time of some low level wage slave.

If the scam came from Ghana then you'd be dealing with a sole trader whose time is precious and who can't afford to waste time on red herrings and dead ends. 

Realistically, the best thing you and your friend can do is tell the story to as many people as possible. The more people who know, the harder it is for the scammers. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Last Action Hero, while a fun movie was panned at the time for being endemic of the bloated budget, mindless action movies of the time. Ironically, it was criticised for being the very kind of film it was trying to parody.

The project was passed from director to director and screenwriter to screenwriter taking on comedy, action and fantasy elements as it went. One minute the film is a sad tale about a boy who worships the movie, the next a rollicking adventure adventure and then suddenly a child gets thrown to his death off a building. And oh look, an animated cat.

The studio just kept throwing money and resources at the movie trying to make it into the summer blockbuster it could never be.

And then Jurassic Park was released in the same week and the whole thing fell apart. The movie, which isn't awful, was humiliated by the success of both Spielburg's film and Sleepless in Seattle.

	<TEXT> As an Australian let me just make sure I've got this straight, this commercial was 'controversial' because they were speaking foreign languages and not English

And all this is is despite the fact English IS a foreign language from, you know, England and is just one of 330 spoken in the country, over 175 of which are indigenous?

EDIT: AND, I've just learned, English isn't even the official language of America!

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> In his own words...

 The show most go on... Yesterday during one of my escape street shows... I had this happen. 
 
 I was tired up, for my friends that have not seen it, in a large canvas drawstring sack., then bound with tips ropes. Also my thumbs were taped together. I had a crowd of about 150 people watching,. 
 
 At this point I'm pretty much like an upside down spittle. 
 
 Out of nowhere this crazy guy rugby tackles me knocking me to the ground and falling on top of me. A couple of other performer came and dragged the guy off. His mate was recording it for YouTube as a stunt. They then both ran off. Somehow I regained my composure and explained to the audience and children how stupid it was. I finished the show in mega pain but full of adrenalin. I went home very sore and after not being able to lay down went the the hospital where I spent most of the night waiting to be seen(not complaining many people needed help before me) 
 
 The outcome is that he broke 2 of my ribs and I am now on very song painkillers. It will take 6 weeks to mend. 
 
 I am up after 2 hours sleep and on my way to do a gig. 
 
 If anyone sees a YouTube of this please let me know, it had been reported to the police and they are investigating cctv footage.
 


Any help would be great. Patty is the nicest man alive and does not deserve this shit. </TEXT>
