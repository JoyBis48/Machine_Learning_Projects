	<TEXT> "indoor practice facility is partnering with SunPower to install a 55,000 square foot solar panel array that will generate 850kW of electricity.  Almost half of the roof will be covered with solar panels allowing it to be a net-zero electricity facility, meaning it creates more energy than it consumes. There will even be a live dashboard that will display how much energy is being produced, and other information about the panels on the roof mounted in the facility."
[source](http://bsndenver.com/what-you-didnt-know-about-the-new-cu-facilities-part-1/). 
The climate control will be by evaportive coolers. These use 1/8th the power of air conditioning. They can be used in Boulder because of the area's low humidity. 

Edit- apparently there's a neighborhood in Boulder that is zero energy, from 2009

I really hope they manage to keep the field house but I guess they won't need it if they can put a floor down in the practice facility for non-football events. Expanding the concourse on coors has also been in discussion, I don't see how they do that with the little room to expand outside.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Colorado Construction Update- Leading the Nation in Innovation </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-06-23 20:35:05 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I thought I would try writing my own type of construction update as I pass by the facilities daily. 

Construction updates are all over /r/cfb so what makes this one unique? Green innovation. 
The solar panels on the indoor practice facility have started being placed. The skeleton of the structure is viewable on the [construction cam] (http://www.cubuffs.com/ViewArticle.dbml?ATCLID=209458799). So why do solar panels matter? They matter because the [indoor practice facility](http://www.cusustainableexcellence.com/ipf.html), 110,000 square feet, will be the only self-sustaining indoor practice facility in the country. 

This isn't the first CU athletic facility to lead the nation in a green initiative, Folsom Field became the [first zero waste stadium in 2008] (http://www.colorado.edu/ecenter/zero-waste-football-games). This is all part of [Ralphie's Green Stampede] (http://www.cubuffs.com/ViewArticle.dbml?ATCLID=1549812) that consists of many eco-friendly initiatives to keep CU as one of the greenest and most innovative universities. 

The setting of CU on the edge of the Rocky Mountains is a constant reminder of why CU leads the way in building a more sustainable future.  The new facilities will also lead Colorado football into a brighter future, with sustained success to rival that of the 90's. After all, if you build it, they will come. Well, 3 people are coming so far....  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would rethink the reps. I do 5x5 and my weights go up 5lbs a week for bench and squat. I study exercise science and high weight with few reps will get your max strength higher while lower weight at high reps is more endurance.
