	<TEXT> Looks like dad might have lost something you're not aware of. His bandaging skills are bad ass. He's done this before clearly.... 
Edit: pressed save too early and missed something out. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah blame the chain for not helping its disabled employee's more tbh. Totally their fault clearly haha. But again a 60 year old deaf lady who doesn't even attempt to lip read is kinda silly. And yes I'm aware that we should make changes for them and not the other way around but its the simple things that are taught to deaf children all around the world to help them overcome these things. So yeah she did it on purpose imo. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not sure on this but I think like 99% of deaf people learn to lip read pretty damn well. Sounds like she was trolling you. Unless she was looking away from you through the entire situation which you said she wasn't. To be honest a badge reading I'm deaf does not prepare you for how to deal with the situation and that persons employers should be taking more steps to avoid this kind of thing. Totally not your fault. Although a little less laughing could have been avoided perhaps..... p.s. I'm from wales too woop. </TEXT>
