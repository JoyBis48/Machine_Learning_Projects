	<TEXT> YES! Today I was looking through this guy's profile and he is obsessed with diapers.  By scrolling down his news feed he had multiple pictures that said "share this if you're an adult that loves wearing diapers"...and then I looked through his profile pictures...big mistake...he had a picture of him in a diaper...never again. </TEXT>
