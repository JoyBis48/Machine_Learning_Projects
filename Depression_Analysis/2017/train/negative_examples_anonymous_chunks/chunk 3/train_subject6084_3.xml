 Exonic Transcription Factor Binding Directs Codon Choice and Affects Protein Evolution

 Genomes contain both a genetic code specifying amino acids and a regulatory code specifying transcription factor (TF) recognition sequences. We used genomic deoxyribonuclease I footprinting to map nucleotide resolution TF occupancy across the human exome in 81 diverse cell types. We found that ~15% of human codons are dual-use codons (duons) that simultaneously specify both amino acids and TF recognition sites. Duons are highly conserved and have shaped protein evolution, and TF-imposed constraint appears to be a major driver of codon usage bias. Conversely, the regulatory code has been selectively depleted of TFs that recognize stop codons. More than 17% of single-nucleotide variants within duons directly alter TF binding. Pervasive dual encoding of amino acid and regulatory information appears to be a fundamental feature of genome evolution.

	<TEXT> It does. The research article is [here](https://www.sciencemag.org/content/342/6164/1367.full) and says that [codons](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_code), the three-letter codes in our DNA that stand for an amino acid in protein synthesis, can **simultaneously** code for an amino acid **and** a transcription factor binding site. [Transcription factors](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_factor) control the expression of genes, i.e. turning them on or off. These dual-use codons, or "duons" as they have called them, represent the "second code" that OP's article is talking about. Even though I only just read it, it looks like a big deal. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes, and it seems that codon bias - the observed preference of some redundant codons over others - may be explained by these "duons", which would be one of the major findings of this paper from a molecular evolution angle. From the abstract:

	<TEXT> The research article is [here](https://www.sciencemag.org/content/342/6164/1367.full). As mentioned in OP's link, it seems that some codons (of which there are 64 in the standard [genetic code](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_code)), can simultaneously encode an amino acid and a transcription factor binding site. [Transcription factors](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_factor), put very crudely, control how genes are turned on or off. The discovery of these codons with dual use, hence the term "duons", is very interesting.

	<TEXT> Yes DNA is still fragmented and assembled with PacBio's own proprietary assembly software HGAP. The advantage of SMRT is much longer read lengths (thousands of bases) compared to Illumina for example (50-150 bases). Despite the lower base calling accuracy of SMRT (although I hear the accuracy is getting better all the time) the longer read length helps with assembly greatly, and I can say from personal experience that this gives some *very* promising preliminary results for genome sequencing. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For clarity, it should be also noted that these technologies are just different ways of sequencing sequence fragments. No matter how long they are, especially for SMRT, they still need to be computationally assembled to recover an entire chromosome, for instance. Until someone can rapidly sequence an entire chromosome linearly from start to end, it is still "shotgun sequencing". </TEXT>
