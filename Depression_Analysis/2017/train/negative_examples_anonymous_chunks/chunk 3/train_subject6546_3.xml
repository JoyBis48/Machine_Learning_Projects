	<TEXT> I'm not sure about Skyrim because I haven't played any other Elder Scrolls games, but I thought Human Revolution was great.  What about it did you think was a huge step backwards?  I don't think that using a game engine necessarily means you will end up with a better game, but at least it allows you to theoretically devote more time and resources to other parts of the game, like story, level design, etc.  Maybe companies just drop the ball sometimes because they are afraid to take risks and try to appeal to the lowest common denominator? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Can we please remember that human health is not the only factor to consider when we ask "Are GMOs a good idea." What about the environmental implications? And why is the burden of proof on the people with concerns to prove that there may be problems.  Where are the in-depth long-term environmental studies before we introduce a new species into the ecosystem.  I don't believe we can guarantee that these fish will NEVER escape their farms and will not breed with wild salmon, fundamentally altering the entire ocean's ecosystem.  There is no turning back from that.  Shouldn't we abide by the precautionary principle and not rush into this?!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  It is the Governments of the world allowing things like patenting genes, letting those patents and copyrights exist for a significant amount of time, and making it illegal for farmers to re-use the seed, even if they don't care whether or not the engineered genes survived. If gene patents died out after say, 5 to 10 years, there wouldn't be as much of an issue.

Hmm.. well what happens when you have the same people working for the big corporations that work for the government and go back and forth between them?  [Take a look at this chart](http://occupy-monsanto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/individual_monsanto_federal_position-large.jpg) and tell me that Monsanto isn't at least partially (if not mostly) responsible for the completely unregulated GMO playground. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There are numerous well-documented studies which provide evidence of fluorides harmful effects on the human body and brain.

You can find a complete compilation of these studies at:
http://www.fluoridealert.org/fluoride-dangers/health/index.aspx

Ill give a summary of the most important findings:

**Brain Damage**

it is apparent that fluorides have the ability to interfere with the functions of the brain.
SOURCE: National Research Council. (2006). Fluoride in Drinking Water: A Scientific Review of EPA's Standards. National Academies Press, Washington D.C. p 187.

Studies in animals and human populations suggest that fluoride exposure, at levels that are experienced by a significant proportion of the population whose drinking water is fluoridated, may have adverse impacts on the developing brain. Though no final conclusions may be reached from available data, the findings are provocative and of significant public health concern.

SOURCE: Schettler T, et al. (2000). Known and suspected developmental neurotoxicants. pp. 90-92. In: In Harms Way - Toxic Threats to Child Development. Greater Boston Physicians for Social Responsibility: Cambridge, MA. (See report)

As of now, there are 18 human studies indicating that fluoride exposure is associated with lower IQs in children.  This is after controlling for other facturs which are associated with differences in IQ such as lead exposure and family income.  Some excepts:

These negative correlations between IQ and urinary As and between IQ and urinary fluoride indicate that exposure to high levels of As or fluoride, or both, could affect childrens intelligence... This study indicates that exposure to fluoride in drinking water is associated with neurotoxic effects in children.
SOURCE: Wang SX, et al. (2007). Arsenic and fluoride exposure in drinking water: children's IQ and growth in Shanyin county, Shanxi province, China. Environmental Health Perspectives 115(4):643-7.

Conclusion: High fluoride burden has a definite effect on the intellectual and physical development of children.
SOURCE: Wang S, et al. (2005). Effects of coal burning related endemic fluorosis on body development and intelligence levels of children. Journal of Applied Clinical Pediatrics 20(9): 897-898.

**Cancer**

There are many in-vitro laboratory studies which show that fluroide is a mutagenic compound, meaning it causes changes in DNA.  Many mutagenics are also carcinogenic.  One study even found that primates are more sensitive to the mutagenic effects than rats.
See: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7679201?dopt=Abstract

Other findings:

As cells were exposed to higher doses of fluoride, the percentage of L-02 cells with DNA damage increased. This result is consistent with other studies... Therefore, considereing previous studies, we think that fluoride can cause lipid peroxidation, DNA damage and apoptosis, and that there is a positive relationship among these changes.
SOURCE: Wang AG, et al. (2004). Effects of fluoride on lipid peroxidation, DNA damage and apoptosis in human embryo hepatocytes. Biomedical and Environmental Sciences 17: 217-22.

**Bone Fractures and Bone Disease**

There is a well-known arthritic bone disease known as Skeletal fluorosis caused by excessive fluoride intake. Images: warning! may disturb you  

Many studies show that fluoride weakens bones:

In A/J strain, we found significant decreases in stiffness with increasing fluoride dose treatment. There was a significant difference between the treatment group 0 ppm and 100 ppm... In the A/J strain, there was a decrease in ultimate load with increasing fluoride dose treatment, with significant differences between the treatment group 0 ppm and the treatment group 100 ppm (p=0.017).

SOURCE: Mousny M, et al. (2006). The genetic influence on bone susceptibility to fluoride. Bone Aug 18; [Epub ahead of print]

The highest fluoride intake (50 mg/L) significantly diminished vertebral strength... This impairment of mineralization by fluoride appeared to be the primary cause of the diminished vertebral strength.

SOURCE: Turner CH, et al. (2001). Combined effects of diets with reduced calcium and phosphate and increased fluoride intake on vertebral bone strength and histology in rats. Calcified Tissue International 69: 51-57.

These are just some of the documented health-impairments associated with ingesting fluoride.  Others include:
**Dental Fluorosis** (yellowingof the teeth due to too much fluoride).  I have this!  as does 32% of American children according to the Center for Disease Control
http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/ss5403a1.htm

**Pineal and Thyroid gland impairment**  These glands are extremely important in regulating all types of normal body operations like emitting hormones and important neurotransmitters.  According to this study, the pineal gland is the primary target of fluoride accumulation within the body.

	<TEXT> Well, you see, complexity is subjective, that's the nature of emergence. What's complex for a child like you is often trivial or routine for a scientist like me. Reddit's userbase is quite diverse, although there seems to be evidence of an over-representation of individuals exhibiting childish behaviors.
Secondly, do you really think this situation has been has been oversimplified? It's through using "copypastas" and other hasty generalizations you try to cram each individual scenario with its particularities into a formulaic mold. I hypothesize you require this simplification because of the state of your mental faculties and reasoning skills.
And lastly, most of the time your simplifications do not aid in understanding new facets of the subject matter. Characterizations that might not be 100% accurate can act as useful models for understanding overarching facets of complex inter-dependent systems, but your "copypastas" do not facilitate in that endeavor.
If even one of these criticisms is valid, your point is moot as it depends unilaterally on all the three premises I've highlighted. The social commentary you wish "copypastas" to exhibit might seem sensible, maybe even profound to you, but they're just as bad, if not worse than the additions reactiongifs, pun chains or novelty accounts bring to the table. Please consider this seriously, and don't immediately fall back on your preconceived notions without reexamining their validity, at least in a cursory manner after I've presented you with this new evidence you really should take seriously. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The solution to all of this is to reorganize society from the ground up. Hyper-local, and online communities with their own internal organization, which can in turn organize into meta-communities like cells of a body.  Community gardens, new forms of communes that embrace the good side of technology.  Any way that we can help each other become self-sufficient.  The more we do this the less we will rely on the status-quo system.  We will cease paying taxes.  No one will elect to go to war.

Ultimately, everyone will come away from the discussion more informed, and hopefully one step closer to Truth.*

*I will actively combat my own confirmation bias by deliberately seeking viewpoints different than my own.  I will critically evaluate all evidence presented, whether it confirms or challenges my current beliefs.  For I understand that there are no "sides".  Only what is true and what is untrue.*

*I will humble myself enough to admit when I am wrong.  There is no shame in changing my mind in light of new information.  My goal is not only to guide others towards realization, but also myself.*

*The process of investigating with dedication and integrity will serve to make all of us ever-more informed, ever-more discerning, and always moving towards the Truth.* </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I hear ya!  I know that the last thing that someone who is having a hard time wants her hear is that it's their "fault" or anything like that.  I certainly don't want to imply that anyone deserves to be in pain and don't think problems just go away by snapping your fingers.  However, I do believe that changing your attitude towards believing in yourself and focusing on the positive aspects of your life is often prerequisite for fixing those problems.  You can be totally and completely right about how much crap has come your way, but if that's all you think and talk about, it really isn't going to get any better.  We've got to keep focused on that glimmer of hope, the 5% that is working, until it gets bigger and bigger.

It's interesting you mention science, because I feel like the completely materialistic (meaning concerning the material world) and "objective" world view we've adopted is actually an obstacle for many people to come out of the view that the world sucks.  Things are rarely so cut and dry as a laboratory and subjective experience is much more pertinent to our lives.  I know this is a whole philosophical can of worms.  Also, I disagree that worrying really ever serves a useful purpose.  We can certainly address things that come up without getting bogged down in worst-case scenarios.  Like John Lennon said "There are no problems, only solutions!"

You're totally right about that last point! The best thing you can do is to just be happy and help others be happy too! =)

EDIT: Oh, and for the record. I used to be extremely depressed for many years.  Nothing changed about my life except my philosophy and my attitude.  I'm speaking from my personal experience. </TEXT>

The one that comes to my mind is the idea that life sucks or is really hard.  I hear this all the time from people who feel like they've had it rough.  It's almost always a self-fulfilling prophesy.  Yes we have problems here on Earth, but the attitude with which we approach these problems makes all the difference.  Unlearn the lie that life is hard, and you'll find it's actually really easy and fun! </TEXT>

There is no possible way systematically defaming political dissidents threw libel, fraud, and "false flag" attacks can be legally justified.  Somehow this should end up in the Supreme Court.  Of course we shouldn't rely on that corrupt bunch to stop this, but a legal fight would certainly bring it to the public's attention.  Right now they are just doing this in the shadows.  We need to force them to defend what they are doing so it can be met with the scrutiny it deserves.

This is just one idea. Let's hear some strategies for subverting the subversion of free discourse on the internet! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Except that there are actually emotions which are expressed nearly universally across animal species.  For instance, animals (including humans) will tighten the muscles around their eyes to express anger.  [Charles Darwin wrote about the subject.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Expression_of_the_Emotions_in_Man_and_Animals)  My point is that we often wrongly conclude that humans are the only animals that can feel or think and this is why we are surprised when we see animals looking "human". </TEXT>

	<TEXT> From comments on the article:

There are 75 community gardens on about 23 acres of land scattered throughout the city of Seattle, serving roughly 4500 gardeners. These plots, called p-patches, are open to the public and neither fenced nor guarded. Homeless people often camp next to our patch, and they've never taken anything from the garden to my knowledge (though it's so abundant that a bit of pilferage would be hard to detect). In general, theft from Seattle gardens is very rare, so I would expect the same to be true of the Beacon Food Forest. I'm sure the city will post signs clearly stating that taking more than a single family can consume or selling produce is forbidden. You'd be very surprised how law-abiding people are here. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I actually had this experience while on Ayahuasca.  It was very scary indeed and I was thinking "what a dumb way to die! forgetting how to inhale."  Of course I started breathing again.  The shaman also assured me that my body would not do that to me and I would inevitably find my breath again.  I guess the best thing to do is to remember this, you will start breathing again. Remain calm.  This is part of the wisdom of the experience. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Just because there are two possible outcomes to something doesn't mean they are equally likely.  Your chance of picking the right door out of a thousand is .1%  The chance of it being the wrong door is the inverse of that (100 - .1)%.

Here's another way to put it: Today you can either die or not die.  Is the chance that you will die today 50/50?  Is the chance that will die on  any day that is not today 50/50? </TEXT>
