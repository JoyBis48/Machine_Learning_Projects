	<TEXT> Thanks, so is [this](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001O4EPHA/ref=noref?ie=UTF8 psc=1 s=electronics) the cable that I need?

I'll still look at some guides before I pull the trigger, don't want to mess this up. </TEXT>

The only things I can remember that I didn't take from LI were the RAM and optical drive, are those 2 alright? Any other comments on the parts are also highly appreciated.

The thing I'm most concerned about in the build are the cables, I get pretty lost when people start hooking everything up in the videos I watch. Is it easy to find clear instructions in the manuals? And most importantly, do I need to buy any cables, or are they all included with the parts? (the optical drive is what got me worried)

Thanks for any help. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> [Here's my Saturn V-inspired build](http://imgur.com/a/VFFax). As you can see, it was pretty tried and true on the Mun, always had enough fuel to make it back. Got me to Eve just by adding a bunch of boosters and one or two small modifications (though that lander was a one-way trip). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Patcher wasn't working for me, either.

But 0.17 finally appeared on the download page and it's been going pretty fast so far, seems like the best way to get it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I personally like using [Heavens Above](http://www.heavens-above.com/).

If you want to see other satellites, I live in a pretty bright suburb and I don't bother with anything above a magnitude 1 (the lower the better). </TEXT>
