	<TEXT> This is a high risk policy. It cost an insane amount compared to regular insurance. It is mandate in louisiana for years after a DUI or DWI. It is essentially the same as a standard policy but it cost more because of your history and the risk it takes to insure you.




I'm sure there are other reasons, I can only speak to my experience in Louisiana and in my case it was a requirement after a DUI. I also had to ride out the years it was required to have without further incident or the requirement time would be longer. I pay about 70$  month now, but during my sr22 period it was over 200$ per month.  </TEXT>

Also you can use antibiotics from your cut foot incident to help with your tooth infection. Antibiotics will help bring down your infection no matter what they were designed for. Why?

	<TEXT> To add, another aspect of slavery rarely touched on was the price of goods. The south and it's products such as cotton could basically charge whatever they deemed. The north could not effectively combat these prices by boycott because the south wasn't paying their workers so a boycott would not effect them much. The north could only hold out for so long, they needed the products offered from the south.




So slavery was a human rights issue in one hand but also very much an economic of goods issue that had nothing to do with the terror of slaves or improving their livelihood  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> One of the sentences you pointed out does need some restructuring but most of what you brought up is just rephrasing the sentence to your liking. It's mostly your opinion on how you would write it as opposed to being grammatically correct. There are issues grammatically but not to the extent you are portraying. I do need to improve the effectiveness of punctuation. 



I disagree it doesn't have a good flow, which is mainly determined by opinion anyway. We can both read Hemingway and agree its good, well structured, grammatically sound but disagree on flow.

The "trip" sentence I see nothing wrong with in the story. Again I do like the concept of the story being written by an insane person who hasn't returned from the dark. I will experiment in my next draft to bring to life the insanity of this "author" and his plea for others to take this trip.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A misconception is actors can only do what they have done in the past. You can tell a great actor by diversity in his roles, so i do like Rockwell for this role as ive said but dont limit yourself thinking well this actor has never done this type of role so it means he cant.




I think Affleck seized the opportunity to work with one of the greatest directors in recent history. The first time i saw this movie it blew me away. But Fichers movies are so great b/c of their rewatch ability imo. I cant tell you how many times ive watched fight club, girl with dragon tattoo, etc




But affleck just doesnt hold up in multiple viewings after the script and its twist are revealed imo. With that said i think his directing will only improve a great deal from this point on. Makes me wish he was still doing Kings The Stand. </TEXT>

The second sentence is saying your dark(madness) side is linked to your light(sane) side no matter if you try to deny or confirm. A denial would be frail and weak and to confirm is bold and strong.




Good call on a few sentences there. Although i do like the idea "i have taken the trip some say i have never returned" so that madness plays a part in sentence formation and structure. Although this was not my intention it is a fruitful thought   </TEXT>

Edit, When it comes to movies, sites or critics almost never have the same taste as you, and when they do about a specific movie it's simply by chance.

	<TEXT> I found it quite interesting. An atheist trying to find supernatural meaning ending in tragedy. Even with its unfavorable outcome and unreasonable evidence he never released that supernatural feeling. Like a non believer who knows you cannot prove something doesnt exist, but knows there is a possibility, he chose to indulge in the small chance of the supernatural that he cant bring himself to apply to the grand scheme of things, but instead applys it to his intimate side and emerse his love in the supernatural. Maybe not the authors intention but it provoked my reaction none the less. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [OT] Contending with Madness, a trip to the Dark Side of your Mind. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-07-08 02:05:58 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> To defend your madness is to defend your sanity. They are infinitely linked, eternally combined, a part of all of us no matter the frailty of the denial or the strength of the conformation. We are all trapped in our heads, there is no escape, there is nothing more. Our minds are a small galaxy and each of us add to the multiverse of the human existence. With your bloodline being your universe. We are all on the deepest levels at an extreme distance from each other but on a cosmic scale ever so close. We can if we really try and reach out, attempt to connect, like a highly advanced telescope spying on the surrounding cosmos, and dig into the endless wonders of the neighboring universe. And if you know how and what to look for the data can be immense and overwhelming. But never the less an illusion to a true connection.






We are all moving away from each other at a staggering pace, starting from the time we began. We hide parts of ourselves that can never be found, and with enough time not even by the hider themselves. Our secrets overlap secrets that overlap secrets that's overlapping a distant face of the Truth. The part of ourselves that are hidden are locked in a safe that's filled with other smaller safes. It is reopened from time to time and a smaller safe with a different combination is neatly tucked in next to all the rest. The individual combinations are lost over time and consequently only so many safes can ever be opened.






Even when you think you have successfully connected with a distant galaxy it is only an illusion to the true contents. You only receive ripples from an ever filling lock box. The real makeup of any soul is only fragments of the Truth. You can trace back their steps, study their orbits, even predict future reactions, and gather all the evidence available. But alas in the end you are only left with theories and no observable science to test, no universal key to their lock box. The mysteries that are trapped there are most not even obtainable to the author(hider) themselves, lost to the dark side. 






Living inside this false illusion is where the light shines brightest, you can only expose your forgotten past, hidden truths, and the origin of your true nature by exploring the Dark Side of your Mind, the side of your mind that's orbit never touches the light. A trip there and you will never return the same, if you return at all. The Madness, the Darkness, it will forever be intertwined in your being, grabbing ahold, tightening its grip and never letting go.







But there in that darkness will be the long lost combinations of your past, and the keys to your future. The trip is worth the burden, outweighs the risk of never leaving the comfort, the light. To make this trip is to make the most of your galaxy and better understand the multiverse that surrounds us all. My trip has been satisfying and enlightening, although some say I have never returned. But I find solace in something the great Alexander Dumas wrote, " There is neither happiness nor misery in the world, there is only the comparison of one state to another, nothing more. He who has felt the deepest grief is best able to experience supreme happiness." 




       

So Travel to the Dark Side of your Mind and contend with your Madness.  </TEXT>

Spark inspiration in others and freely receive these charges. Fear none but respect all. Enjoy this gift as this will be your only one. Make sure in your final moments , as the movie of your past and present plays out you are not filled with Regret but overcome with a feeling of having Reinvented the Gods. Only then will we meet, and i know you've got an entertaining film, so i got my popcorn ready, so 2 say.



GOD



Ps. Dont know how you got my email but wont fare you well to give it out. Dont reply, Im watching movies  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [WP] Contending with Madness, take a trip to the Dark side of your Mind </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-07-07 09:48:50 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> To contend with Madness is to defend your sanity. We are all trapped in our heads, there is no escape, there is nothing more. Our minds are a small galaxy and each of us add to the multiverse of the human existence. Your bloodline is your universe. We are all distant but on some cosmic scale ever so close. We can if we really try reach out, sort of like a highly advanced telescope spying on the surrounding cosmos, and dig in to the endless wonders of a neighboring universe. And if you know how and what to look for the data can be immense and overwhelming.



We are all moving away from each other at a staggering pace, starting from the time we began. We hide parts of ourselves that can never be found, and with enough time not even by the hider themselves. Our secrets overlap secrets that overlap secrets overlapping a distant face of the truth. The parts of our soul that are hidden are locked in a sort of safe that's  filled with other smaller safes. It is reopened from time to time and another safe with a different combination is neatly tucked in next to all the rest. The individual combinations have been lost with time and only so many safes can ever be opened.



Even when you think you have successfully communicated with a distant galaxy it is only a illusion to the true contents. You only receive ripples from an ever filling lock box. The real makeup of any soul is only fragments of the Truth. You can trace backs their steps, study their orbits, even predict future reactions, and gather all the evidence available. But alas in the end you are only left with theories and no observable science to test, no universal key to their lock box. The mysteries that are trapped there are some no longer even known to the hider themselves, lost to the dark side.



Living inside this false illusion is where the light shines brightest, you can only expose your forgotten past, hidden truths, and the origin of your true nature by exploring the Dark side of your mind, the side of your mind that's orbit never touches the light. A trip there and you will never return the same, if you return at all. The madness, the Darkness, it will forever be intertwined in your being, grabbing ahold, tightening its grip, and never letting go. 




But there in that darkness will be the long lost combinations of your past, and future. It will not be easily spotted and it will not be easily obtained. The trip is worth the burden, outweighs the risk of never leaving the comfort, the light. To make this trip is to make the most of your galaxy and better understand the multiverse that surrounds us all. As Alexander Dumas wrote "there is neither happiness nor misery in the world, there is only the comparison of one state to another, nothing more. He who has felt the deepest grief is best able to experience supreme happiness."



         so Travel to the Dark Side of your Mind, and Contend With Madness.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> im not being critical and you can choose to see it that way. Im either addressing the fact they didnt answer the questions, only answered one, or askin them to elaborate on answers.



I dont see that as aggressive but i see at as inquirying further those who are interested enough to reply. If you dont like it thats ok i dont feel alot of posters see it that way 



EDIT: i also believe some people read just the title and skip the description, so some just might not know im looking for more than the title </TEXT>

Most historical claims in the bible come under much scrutinty even by christians




Do you think if you were brought up in a different enviroment you would have found a different religion?




So you have looked to see what other religions offered or not?




There are some controversal things in the christian faith, do you agree with all of them? </TEXT>
