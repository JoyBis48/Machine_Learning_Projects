	<TEXT> Does it really matter who you find attractive? You shouldn't let other people's opinions determine your actions. What you find attractive about a person is so subjective that anyone else who judges has no validity.

Interracial couples are great because each person gets to experience, learn and adopt a part of another culture. They get to share traditions and food. It's a positive for all since each person becomes more cultured by the experience. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Because the clitoris is so sensitive, Brandon says, she sees women being more specific about their preferences for how they want to be touched. "[Men] rarely tell me, 'She touches too hard, too soft, she tickles, her hands are cold.' Women say those things all the time about how men touch their vulvas, clitorises included. Women are finicky, and so are their clitorises." 

Men rarely say anything to women because they're either too shy or too awkward to voice their concerns or they think criticizing the way a womam touches their penis will discourage further handjobs.

Well, I'll do a service for most men by saying: Most women's handjob technique is horrible! Guys, speak up and tell your women how to properly give handjobs. </TEXT>
