	<TEXT> I'm not proud.  I browse the web on a (Dell Optiplex 770L)[http://support.dell.com/support/edocs/systems/op170l/en/ug/specs.htm].  You may laugh, but it was free and it runs Ubuntu just fine, thank you very much.  But every so often I click on a stupid oversized cell-phone picture like (this one)[http://imgur.com/FVQ5x] (only chosen because it's the latest culprit)  and it FREEZES MY COMPUTER FOR ABOUT 3 MINUTES WTF!?!  The picture wasn't even that funny and there's NO REASON ON EARTH THAT IT NEEDED TO BE 1,936px  2,592px.  No reason at all.  The resolution is crappy and there's just not that much information there anyway.  imgur provides low-resolution links, let's start using them, people!

Thank you for your time. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Once I was waiting on the subway platform with a group of friends, and this woman was singing acapella.  She was *terrible*.  I walked over to her and told her I'd give her a dollar if she'd stop singing until we got onto the train.  She looked confused and explained that she'd been classically trained.  I said, "Well, I don't know much about music, but there's something very wrong here."  She accepted the dollar and stopped singing.  My wife was mortified, and one friend said, "You're either my hero or the biggest asshole I've ever met."

I report, you decide. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> k.  I'm gonna jump in here.  Years ago I was talking with a gay friend over beers, and I asked: "What is **with** you guys?  Why are [your clubs](http://www.paradisecambridge.com/) always getting shut down over wild orgies?"  He explained, "In heterosexual relationships there's usually one party who wants to do it **all the time** and another who sort of keeps things sane.  Well, you get a bunch of guys together, and you pretty much don't have that sanity element.  Everybody wants to do it." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Just to put your $400 in perspective:  The sysadmin and I put an incorrectly configured redirect click server into the pool, so it basically silently failed to redirect clicks to our paying advertisers, and not only that, it was logging the failures as 200s, i.e., successful pages served, so none of our Nagios alerts were fired.  Nobody noticed it until the next morning, so 1/3 of our click logs were lost.  The business is ALL clicks, and if they're not served, we're not paid.  Lost revenue was about $25k.  Our overlords were *not* happy. </TEXT>
