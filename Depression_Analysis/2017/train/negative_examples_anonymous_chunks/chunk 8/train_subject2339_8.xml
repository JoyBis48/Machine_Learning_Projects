This is where new ones are posted.  The only way to find out where the chain goes is to dive on in.  (or google for cheaters)  

I started following a link a few weeks ago i stop and bookmark the page and pick it up again later.  I am only 4 months back so far.  A friend tells me that is speeds up the farther back you go though.  

Have fun </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think that this might be getting blown out of proportion.  A lot of times you can make something sound bad when it really isn't.  If NASA signed off on this fix, I am tempted to believe they thought it was a reasonable way to fix the problem.  

Here is an example of another way you could write this.  

* Insider says that cracks in the tank liner came up occasionally.  They would fix problem by applying a layer of teflon to the area in order to prevent cracks from spreading.

When you word it like that it sounds a lot less like shoddy workmanship and a lot more like legitimate repair practice.  

Even if they were doing this we don't now that this was the cause.  Elon said that it was an over pressurization event.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes I understand what you are saying.  I think the reason people see hubris as a dangerous trait is that being overly confident can put you into dangerous situations. Someone who does not want to admit that they are in over their head is dangerous, but i would say someone who does not realize they are in over their head is even more dangerous.  It is also because even the best pilot in the world our still susceptible to the mechanical failures and limitations of the airplane.  I think people say that over confidence is a dangerous attitude because often times it comes with cockiness and the "nothing can hurt me" mentality. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Plenty of pilots who are not celebs are naturally gifted at everything, I feel the need to brag that I passed my PPL in one hobs unit past minimum... one and only that one because of some stupid twat in circuit delaying me! Yes, I was the smug star pupil, and I loved it.

Just giving you a tip, bragging about how you got your PPL right at 40 hour is a pretty stupid thing to brag about.  Nobody will think that you are a better pilot for saying so, and the fact that you are bragging about it will only reflect badly on you and your judgment.  

Getting your PPL close to 40 hours is more luck than anything, and training more than 2-3 times a week.  Many people just don't have the time and money to train at that pace.  The fact that you blame "some stupid twat in circuit" for you not getting in at exactly 40 hours further reflects badly upon you as a pilot.

Just wondering where did you get your training? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This article seems to ignore basic facts, Like when you pollute a river, nobody lives near it, and the land is essentially worthless so nobody is going to bother spending money to defend it.  

It also ignores common resources that are impossible to regulate with a pure market, like the air, or oceans.  I think anti government conservatives and libertarians who think the world would be a Utopia without government regulation, should go to Mexico.

I love Mexico, but they have serious problems with water quality and air quality.  In many cases this is due to there being much less regulation.  In many places raw sewage goes directly in to rivers and streams, along with industrial chemicals from factories.  If you are within 100 feet of the river you can smell it.  In the US we Used to do this exact same thing, in fact there are even some crazy stories about [Rivers catching on fire.](https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Cuyahoga_River#Environmental_concerns)  But around the 70s and 80s we decided that it was time to start taking care of our country.  We created things like the EPA in order to regulate things that are damaging to the environment in order to make the US a better place to live.

Here is another example with the air.  Do you like to exercise outside going on bike rides and runs though your city?  I do too, and when i did it in a city in Mexico my lungs would usually start to develop a burning sensation by the time I was done exercising.   But what is a little burning?  Exercise hurts a little right?  Well after doing that for a couple months in a city in Mexico, I started to developed a cough that would not go away.  It was almost like a smokers cough.  

Long story short.  I get back to the US where we have stricter regulations in order to protect air quality.  What do you know after a week or two with some good air those problems just magically went away.  

Most conservatives seem to want it both ways they love that they can swim in rivers and lakes and breath fresh air, but then they want to get rid of the very organizations that have made those things possible.

PS: I just want to say I love Mexico! it is a great place and they are improving so much.  But it is still a good case study to see what a place is actually like when there is less government regulation to protect common resources.

Edit:  My first Gold :)  Thank you kind stranger. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> ah ye of little faith.  

There are tons of ways that she could get to Westeros.  In fact I think GRRM has been laying the groundwork to get her there.  GRRM Dropped a whole fleet of ships right at her doorstep with the iron islanders.  He is now giving her a means to beat the iron islanders with the new Kahl.  all she has to do is gain control of the Dothraki.  My bet is she is going to go back to the womb of the world convince all of the Dothraki to follow her in the biggest Kahl ever and then lead them to Maureen.  Or something along those lines.

She has also had problems controlling her Dragons.  But GRRM just added the plot device of the Giant dragon controlling horn.  The one problem is it kills whoever uses it by burning them.  But We have already been shown on multiple occasions that Danerys can not be burned, so when she uses it, it may give her control of her dragons without killing her.

Also GRRM has brought together quite a few major characters in Maureen.  it makes sense that he has brought them together so they can depart with Danerys.  Almost all the major characters in the area have come together at Mareen.   </TEXT>
