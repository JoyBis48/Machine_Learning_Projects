	<TEXT> Lead exposure is easily mitigated by refraining from handling food at the range, and washing your hands, gun cleaning solvents can be dealt with the same way any other cleaning product is used, by ventilating the area, and unless these doctors and the administration are advocating for removing suppressors from being regulated as NFA Title II devices, I call shenanigans on the notion that they actually care about hearing damage in any meaningful way.

Furthermore, any and all health issues can easily be dealt with by simply distributing a pamphlet that covers basic gun safety, storage, and cleaning procedures with zero need to actually record such information in a database that can be accessed by an army of medical professionals and faceless bureaucrats. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> "Assault weaponsjust like armor-piercing bullets, machine guns, and plastic firearmsare a new topic. The weapons' menacing looks, coupled with the public's confusion over fully automatic machine guns versus semi-automatic assault weaponsanything that looks like a machine gun is assumed to be a machine guncan only increase the chance of public support for restrictions on these weapons. In addition, few people can envision a practical use for these weapons."

-Josh Sugarmann, founder of the Violence Policy Center, "Assault Weapons and Accessories in America," 1988

That's just one quote. There are plenty more where that came from. 

A lot of average Joes support gun control because that's what the media and their leaders tell them is good. 

However, at the highest levels, make no mistake, the officials and policy makers who support gun control aren't just simply misinformed. They are outright lying to you, me, and the American people.

To people like Dianne Feinstein and Michael Bloomberg, gun control is purely an issue of instituting policies that consolidate power in the hands of a wealthy and well-connected political elite.  </TEXT>

Longer barrel
Better trigger
Upgraded sights (adjustable and or fiber optic)
Flared magazine well 
Extended magazine release

Which options show up will depend on the make/model of pistol. 

In a lot of cases, terms like "pro," "target," "sport," "competition," and especially "tactical" have been so diluted by marketing hype that they don't really mean anything any more.  </TEXT>

Had he wanted to kill them, he could have easily done so, at his leisure, even with a pump action shotgun. 

Hell, using a shot timer, I've actually run side-by-side drills of firing a pump vs semi-auto shotgun, and the difference in the rate of fire amounted to a couple of seconds. 

A two-second difference to do a mag dump doesn't matter in a situation where the perpetrator has the better part of two days to do as he pleases.  </TEXT>

However, anti-gun groups and officials would remain largely unchanged in their goals because if you get then to answer honestly, they support gun control not because of crime or violence, but because of an over-arching need to exercise control over others. 

Crime is simply the pretext. An obsessive need to control others is the actual reason.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I didn't move goal posts, though I admit I should have perhaps been more specific, as it is the DNC and higher ups in the party that hate private gun ownership, at the state and local levels the democrats tend to be, if not more aligned with their constituents, then at least pragmatic about placating them. 

But any presidential contender for the Democratic party will bow to anti-gun pressure, and that pressure will come from the party bosses, donors, and senior members serving in high-level elected positions. 

Hell, based on the posts here, Webb had tried to play both sides of the fence on background checks, claiming to support them for gun shows, but not other private party transfers. 

I guarantee you that stance, milquetoast as it is, will harden to a full on support for Bloomberg-style mandatory checks.

What matters is that Bloomberg has effectively unlimited resources to put boots on the ground to gather signatures, and then back that up with major ad buys on radio, television, and the Internet.

I'm simply pointing out the racist outcome of a law you support.

I'll also note that you've completely failed to articulate why throwing Shaneen Allen in prison is in the best interest of society or safety.

All you've done in this entire thread is make a fallacious appeal to popularity (what's hilarious is that you can't even make that claim, as Ms. Allen was put into a diversion program AFTER a massive public outcry at the injustice of imprisoning her.)

But, hey, you're the one who's already voiced support for making it a felony to run a stop sign on an empty road.

In short, you're a dimwit, and not even your fellow graboid lunatics have tried to make the case that she should be convicted of a felony, because anyone with the least bit of tolerance or empathy can see the injustice of the situation.

Please, continue, as I do so love sharing your posts with others as an example of the pathological narcissism inherent to anti-gun culture. </TEXT>

Please, continue, as I quite enjoy sharing your posts on other forums with people who find you as hilarious as I do.

Once again, please explain why you think an African American mother of two who's committed a completely victimless crime should have to lose her children, spend 3 years in prison, and live the rest of her life with a felony conviction all because of your distorted view of the racist founders and a republican governor?

	<TEXT> No, the law in New Jersey allows for leniency in a diversion program, but the prosecutor chose to throw the book at someone who had harmed no one.

You said nothing in support of the diversion program, in essence endorsing throwing the book at her. 

Then, in order to demonstrate what a pathetic coward you are, you won't actually defend your position, rather choosing to hide behind a claim that clearly the law is just because the citizens of New Jersey want such a law (which manages to be a fallacious appeal to popularity, as well as a complete non-sequitur).

Either defend your position for imprisoning her, or admit that you are wrong. 

What the people of New Jersey think isn't the issue here, as what we're concerned with is why YOU support throwing a mother of two in prison for a victimless crime.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Also, if you purchase more than one gun at the same time, they only run one background check.

However, NICS checks get run for reasons other than gun purchases, such as when people get concealed carry permits, and at least one state, Kentucky, runs NICS checks on all CCW holders once a month, which is going to skew the numbers.

As you point out, it's not a one-to-one relationship, but it's an enormous freaking indicator of just how popular guns are. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's very odd.

I do have to say, thanks for writing this article. Seeing something like suppressors demystified in a venue geared toward techies is a very positive thing.

I do have one quibble with this bit, though:

Suppressing a rifle while hunting is one thing; the use cases for suppressing pistols are a lot narrower. "That's the hardest one," Schauble said when we asked why anyone would need or want a suppressed pistol. 

Frankly, I think it's pretty easy to justify suppressing a pistol. If you've ever trained someone who's never shot a handgun before, one of the hardest things for a new shooter to overcome is their sensitivity to the noise and recoil of the gun when it fires.

Here you are, telling them to concentrate on the front sight, and taking the time to coach them on proper trigger pull, and for them to be able to do that, they have to overcome the instinctive human reaction to be surprised and a little scared when it results in a very loud noise and movement.

Coaching a completely new shooter is made much, much easier with the addition of a suppressor to a handgun because it removes the most anxiety-inducing part of the whole experience.

It also makes it a lot easier to coach the new shooter, because you don't have to wear hearing protection, which can make it harder for the new shooter to understand.

Again, thanks for this article, overall, it's a really excellent introduction to the topic of suppressors for an audience who may have never seen them outside of the movies or video games. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you want reduced recoil and better control with an AR10, there are several things you can do, and here they are in escalating order of complexity:

1.) Get a better compensator. Look at something like the Bennie Coolie Comp or JP Tank Brake.

2.) Install an adjustable gas block. This will allow you to dial in the right amount of gas that gets siphoned off to cycle the gun.

3.) Install a low-mass bolt carrier, like the one offered by JP.

4.) Install a buffer with tungsten weights.

5.) Shoot light-weight bullets. 135 grain bullets will go a long way to taming recoil on an AR10.

6.) Employ proper shooting technique.

7.) Get in the gym and lift weights. Seriously.

Despite the fact that they look like an AR15, AR10s are a completely different animal. In a stock configuration, they can and will have a much heavier recoil impulse than a stock AR15.

However, if you put the time and effort in to tailoring the rifle's operating system and ammunition, you can reduce recoil by a tremendous amount.

A few months ago, I had the opportunity to shoot an AR10 that had most of the modifications done that I've listed above, and it was almost as low-recoil as shooting a JP CTR-2.

Double taps were extremely easy, and the rifle handled very, very well. So AR10 recoil can be tamed, it just takes effort. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If they actually cared about stopping criminals, they'd work to implement a simple and inclusive plan that would enlist gun owners in *helping* to prevent criminals getting their hands on guns, rather than treating all gun owners like criminals.

For example, most states mark the driver's licenses for people who are under 21 so it's easy for anyone to ascertain at a glance whether they are of legal drinking age.

Implementing a similar plan where everyone's ID is marked so that someone who is  looking to sell a gun can learn whether the person they're dealing with is a prohibited person or not would be far more effective, cheaper, and easier to implement than the so-called "universal background check" schemes that have been pushed by the likes of Bloomberg.

Unfortunately, this isn't actually about preventing criminals from getting guns. If it were, they would actually bother to prosecute the thousands of NICS checks that come back negative on convicted and violent prohibited persons every year. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So, I have a few concerns about the legislation you evidently support.

Does it address the problems that were seen in the Colorado and Washington laws?

You know, like how those laws would make you a criminal for loaning a rifle to a friend for a hunting trip or competition?

Does it fix the prices on background checks, thereby ensuring that no gun dealers will actually be interested in conducting background checks on any transfers except for the ones they conduct on the guns they sell in their shops?

Does it address issues like what happened in Colorado last year when it turned out flood victims who had lost their homes were inadvertently criminalized for transferring their gun collections to friends for safe keeping?

Does it make it a crime to let someone handle a firearm without a background check at a venue other than on a gun range operated by a for-profit enterprise, thereby criminalizing you if you loan your gun to a buddy at a range operated by a non-profit (as most shooting clubs are), on public land, or on private property?

Does the proposed legislation inadvertently discriminate against couples in non-traditional marriages by prohibiting transfer of a firearm without a background check between gay or lesbian couples, while allowing the same sorts of transfers to occur between heterosexual couples?

Does the legislation you support include common-sense exemptions on transfers, for example, those who've already successfully passed a background check in order to acquire a concealed carry permit?

In short, would you care to share the text of the actual legislation that you feel so strongly about?


Thanks. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Guns in the hands of criminals facilitate murder and other crimes. Guns in the hands of responsible people facilitate suicide. Guns in the hands of irresponsible people facilitate accidents. Even self-defense killing is far from desirable. Even responsible gun owners put others at risk when they fire in self defense.

And yet, guns are fired hundreds of millions of times more per year for reasons that are completely legal than they are used for mayhem.

Of course, you also don't want to breach the fact that they're used for self-defense and defense of others around 1-2million times per year.

Furthermore, in your zeal to hate on gun owners, and your wish to disarm them, you demonstrate that everyone who posts here, who's ever used a firearm in self defense, is someone who you wish was dead.

Yeah you don't like me, I remember. I'm just going to start trimming the inane rants out of the quoted text when I respond.

Except they don't. What's it like being wrong *all* the time? Does your mother dress you in the morning?

Since I am not making an argument based on the contents of any instruction manuals, this isn't really a good point.

It's perfectly relevant, because you don't even understand the most basic facts of a subject you claim to be an expert on, and your lack of understanding, real-world experience, or even an open-minded willingness to engage in a forthright dialogue (as opposed to pathetically sub-par trolling) only manages to underscore the fact that you are clearly as ignorant as you are opinionated.

	<TEXT> Once upon a time, I was in a pawn shop where an old guy was trying to buy a gun.

I over heard the conversation between him and the clerk, and it turned out he had marked down that he'd been dishonorably discharged from the military, and had marked that down on the 4473.

The clerk told him he couldn't sell him a gun, and sent him on his way.

Do I think that this particular sad old man should have been sent to prison?

Of course not.

But what's the point of having a law on the books, especially a law that would let you catch criminals with violent histories dead to rights for trying to acquire the means to commit violence if no one is going to throw them in prison for it?

The lack of enforcement on that front is an utter embarrassment to the entire structure of the NICS system, and no one wants to point this out (or, at least here, pedants want to dick around with semantic word games.) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Now you're shifting goal posts.

You started out pointing out that 1/3 of NICS checks that fail do so for erroneous reasons.

Of course no one this side of Michael Bloomberg would advocate throwing those people in jail.

Furthermore, studies have shown that the prosecution rates for NICS violations are very, very minimal, and that includes prohibited persons who've committed violent felonies.

If the powers that be were half as concerned about stopping criminals from getting guns as they claim, that would be a really easy way to stop it right there.
