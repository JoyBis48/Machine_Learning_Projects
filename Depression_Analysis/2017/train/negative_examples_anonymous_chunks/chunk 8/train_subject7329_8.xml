	<TEXT> I have been in for about 3 months just about to come up on my take homes and as I today (i just talked with the head of the clinic), I haven't missed a day and have had all clean UA's.  Have I relapsed since I have been in? Yes I have used H several times but been lucky enough to have it out of my system by the time they UA and it is always random which makes it a bit more scary.  I want to stop using once I start getting take home since if I do get caught I gotta start over again but it's more tempting now because I'm thinking exactly what you are thinking haha.  I don't really have any advice, maybe just try not to use?  Thats the only foolproof way but is a bit hard when you are still at the beginning of maintenence. Also if you gotta use, try to use the day you get UA afterwards or the next day very soon after you were UA'd so less of a chance to get UA'd again. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> okay I don't know any better but I would just think it would be a bit safer to ask for a higher dosage.  I mean I started with just vicodin and ended up eventually smoking bth and that is something I regret but it is just way cheaper than pH arms. Plus same as you my tolerance was building. I dunno I just got cut off from a 3 year steady script of norcos for no reason so I'd assume if doctor found track marks on you it'd be no more scripts for you. I guess just be careful. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> ah you remind me of myself at 21-just starting to jump thru the hoops of trying to attain that first script. I am assuming you have little to no tolerance.  Most likely your gonna get 5/500s if any narcotic is scripted.  Once those don't do the trick anymore its time for more fun- trying to obtain norcos or oxy from your doc.  After a fair amount of time and a lot of work put in convincing and buttering up your doctor(s) you will hopefully have an ongoing script for a halfway decent opiate.  haha sorry I kinda went off on a tangent I don't even know if you are trying to go the route of getting an ongoing script but  yeah your gonna have to start slow and small, this shit doesn't happen overnight. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi I have been taking Paxil for about 12 years now.  I think it's working out ok but the past couple years I have felt more and more anxious and have had probably 10 or so panic attacks in the last couple years.  Would I benefit from a benzo? If so what kind?  Would a doctor be more willing to prescribe me a benzo seeing that I've been on Paxil for so long?  Thanks guys! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> OK well you seem to be in a good position right now.  I have had to sign those contracs too.  I also think it's a bit harder to get a script if you are younger and a male which I assume you are younger person?  also I wasn't trying to be harsh but I noticed I really didn't need my pain medicine as much as I thought after not having them.  I still have the records of being on a narcotic for several years since then I have changed insurance and my doctor and probably could find a new doctor to start prescribing me again but I am over spending all the energy and time going to do doctors and hoping they will give me my medicine back so for now I am just on methadone and actually the done has made my life a lot better since I am NOT worrying when I'm going to run out of my script and have to go to the street and buy some H or pills. the last few months were pretty expensive since I had you end up doing that a bit but now on methadone I never need to worry about running out of meds and it's free. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Going and once a month should be a law pretty soon at least that's what my doctor told me.  We also had a great relationship for several years as I thought until she for some random reason got scared to keep prescribing what she said was the maximum amount of norcos a month .  She mentioned obamacare and the DEA getting stricter on pain meds.  all I know is about six or seven years ago it was a ton easier to get these meds.  I think most doctors are going to try and wean their patients off the narcotic drugs in the next few years.  Now I'm stuck on methadone.  Do you really need these pills? I know you will tell me that you do but you probably deep down know you could probably make it without em.
  I'm not trying to call you out but I will warn you that you got to be like a cancer patient nowadays or really old and in really bad shape to get anything it really sucks.  I am in California and this seems to be how its been working now.  Good luck I never thought this would happen me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes I agree with you. Before I trieed methadone I tried suboxone and it didn't hold me enough so I went back to using for a bit.  I was getting worse with using more by the week so I decided to do a bit of research on methadone to get the facts about it-not the myths or rumors because beforehand I was a bit apprehensive to try methadone- I thought that it was left for hardcore junkies.  Well since I started on it it has really helped i'm really happy because I was thinking to myself if methadone doesn't work I have nothing else to fall back on so I was getting a bit scared.  luckily it worked! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Before I got a methadone I used any opiate I could my hands on. The first time I tried to stop I used suboxone.  I didn't like it it didn't take the edge off enough so I went back to using again. Towards the end before I got on done I was smoking both up to a gram a day. Since being on methadone for 3 months I've only relapsed once. For me methadone is really great and does the trick.  If you ever seriously consider stopping I think methadone can really help you. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> so I have been going to a methadone clinic everyday for about 3 months.  the worst thing about it for me is having to drive there every single day 7 days a week.  pretty soon though I will be getting take homes.  anyways I started this thread to ask you guys that have been to a clinic what is the craziest thing you have seen or heard happen at your clinic.  somebody got stabbed at mine about 2 months before I had started going to it.  also what does most of the clientele look like at your clinic?  I would say 90 percent look like they have been living a pretty hard life so far at my clinic </TEXT>

	<TEXT> why :( haha its not that bad. i figure I am going to need to be on some kinda opiate the rest of my life for the legitimate pain that I have and methadone although not that great if you are looking for recreational value, works great for pain and lasts forever.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> All I know is that day by day doctors and hospitals are tightening up on giving out opiates like they did say 8 or so years ago.  I live in California so I don't know where that state lies on being liberal about dispensing narcotics but I was told to my face by my doc of 5 years whom I had trusted that DEA is really cracking down, blah blah blah.  What really pissed me off is that I was like family with her, she was the one who got me started on pain meds in the first place too.  Vicodin 5s then slowly moved up to Norco.  All I am saying I guess is that I thought for sure I was sitting pretty and had no worries about getting my script pulled out from under me but it did happen.  Sucks because this is going to be happening more and more now as doctors become increasingly hesistant to give out opiates. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> yeah i didn't believe it to be like bath salts but certain people who write articles seem to lump it in with bath salts and other designer type shit.  now that i'm on methadone and doing good with it now I think I'll hold off but possibly later on down the road its good to know that it is there if i'm in a pinch. </TEXT>
