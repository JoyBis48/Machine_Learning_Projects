	<TEXT> I'm working on a shoot in August that has a pretty intense pool scene and Post guy and I thought it might be cool to capture some underwater sounds. That being said, I have no idea what that might sound like, or how I would go about capturing it. I did some research, but I thought I'd ask some of the Pros. What do you all think? </TEXT>
