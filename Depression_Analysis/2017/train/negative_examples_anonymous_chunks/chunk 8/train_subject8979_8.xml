	<TEXT> That's not always true. I haveboth anxiety and depression, you can read my submittions in this account if you want, and I can say that last time I had a an anxiety attack i sent a selfie of me to my "online supporter/friend". 

Pluls, she may've wanted to take a selfie to show that this situation is real. I don't know, but it's not that odd.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I know. She called today, and I was this close to telling her but I didn't know how. She thinks I'm normal, because I always laugh and sit quietly around the house, and I don't know how she would respond. 

I'm gonna tell her anyway. I need to do that, I know. 

Thank you for the support.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Yesterday I wanted to kill myself, and so I was so emotional I wrote a letter to my mother telling her how I feel. She doesn't know how I feel. I put the letter in her case so she could read it at work, but I woke up at 4am and took it. I just don't want her to look at me differently, as if I'm just some fucked up son, because I always look so happy around the house, and I'm afraid to imagine things differently. However, I know I need deep psychological treatment while I'm still young (I'm almost eighteen), but I just don't know how to tell her. 

Any ideas? Any people who experienced something similar to this? Please share your stories/advices. 

Thank you. Any comment would be helpful.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So I've been working on a Hebrew novel for some years now, and I've been collecting all kinds of plot-related notes and writing its plot-related scenes, but I realized there's a problem with that. Well, I should've imagined that eventually I would have too much of notes and scenes that organizing them into a single document would hardly be possible, but I feel that I should tackle this ASAP.

So, dedicated writers of Reddit, how should I approach this? Any effective ways/tools that could perhaps help me during the process? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you. This made me smile so much. 

I think my mom would support me, and I could tell her that I've been writing my own novel, and that I've a girlfriend. This would all be very new to her, and a little embarrassing for me but hey, if this is what it takes to get better, I'm willing to do this. 

I'm probably gonna get anxious about this soon, but right now I've hope. I don't quite know how to explain this, but I feel better just thinking about it. 

I'm gonna PM you, and hopefully I could ask for further assistance and keep you updated? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What kind of therapy do you go to? 

I may tell them I'm depressed, that I really do have a mental illness and that I wanna go see a doctor. I'm only afraid of what if they ask questions, and eventually I'm gonna say that it all began with a girl. 

It's gonna sound pathetic, but when I think about it now, I think I could work this out. Maybe I'd tell my mother, I think she'd understand me more. I'd ask her to keep it a secret - and just visit a doctor to see what's wrong and how we can continue from there. 

What do you think?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've spoken with many people who had anxiety, read about the topic, taken several tests, despite the fact that I think I'm aware of what I'm feeling isn't normal. 

And this won't work, my mother's a doctor and a psychiatrist would cost money. I'm gonna have to keep my depression to myself, at least until I'm on my own.  </TEXT>
