	<TEXT>  That it's pro-American. But it's their right don't you think? Do you think an American newspaper could or should stand against the power and strength of the United States?

WTF are you talking about? Seriously. See my other comment. It's not my subjective opinion. Read the articles, look at who the authors are. Look at what they cover, and what they don't.

[They admit it themselves that they are liberal](http://newsbusters.org/blogs/noel-sheppard/2013/08/18/new-york-times-public-editor-admits-paper-has-liberal-bias)

And they only talk about Rove in the Opinion section - which btw they aren't always favorable to him. MSNBC is left of NYT is left of CNN is left of WSJ is left of FOX. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  The New York Times is considered liberal by people who call New York City "Jew York City"

wtf? ALL of my conservative friends say it's left leaning by a wide margin, and never once have I heard 'Jew York City". You seem pretty ignorant. 

And any objective person will see NYT is liberal. So you are telling me delusional liberals want to think liberal sources are not liberal? That's cool, but they are still delusional. 

I mean, for crying out loud, one of their biggest contributers is Krugman, who is a HUGE liberal, not to mention all the anti-Israel positions they take on a consistent basis.

[A New York Times editor admitted they are a liberal newspaper](http://newsbusters.org/blogs/noel-sheppard/2013/08/18/new-york-times-public-editor-admits-paper-has-liberal-bias)

Honestly it would be like saying Fox is a moderate news station. Anyone who thinks that is clearly biased and blind themselves. It's not as in-your-face liberal as MSNBC or HuffPo, but it certainly is liberal. </TEXT>

what are you saying? It's widely considered a left-leaning newspaper, just link WSJ is considered right-leaning. 

And I didn't say we should outlaw anything. I said that this sub-reddit has more of these left leaning sources than moderate or right-leaning sources. I never said we should 'outlaw them' </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Watched some DBZ Kai. A few thoughts and questions </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-07-03 21:45:05 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> 1. Not crazy about Gohan's voice in Kai. Just an opinion.

2. The music played during Cell's death was just normal music. It was such a letdown. In the original version, there was [this music](https://youtu.be/Ec6fR11dHUk?t=172), which I believe, is not used anywhere else. Hence, it's 'special music' used for cell's death. In Kai, the music used is plain music used throughout DBZ, including times when enemies simply stared at each other.

3. Goku and Gohan could have easily trained in the Hyperbolic Time Chamber, **and gotten sufficient rest**. They had 9 days. So 4 days rest, 1 day in the chamber, and 4 days rest again. So the idea that Goku 'wanted to rest' doesn't really make sense. Then again, he knew Gohan was more than strong enough at that point, so maybe that's why he said that.

4. **Goku had plenty of time to use instant transmission to drop cell off, and return back to earth.** [There is PLENTY of time here](https://youtu.be/JMVTlYExFkY?t=117). That always bothered me. I mean he didn't even try.

5. The dialogues at times, are absolutely the most corny/forced/lame dialogue I've ever seen on television. The dialogue between villians and heroes, is just awful most of the time. It almost feels like that's how people would talk if they were making fun of action movies. It's just so forced and corny. 

6. I understand Vegeta's character, and I like it a lot, but they go way to far in showing his pride. We get it. The "I'm the Prince of all Saiyins and I'm going to kill you haha" is so repeated that it just gets downright stupid. It would have been better if it was more subtle and less in your face. I think he character is much better in the Buu Saga.

7. Piccolo being stronger than a Super Saiyin Vegeta pissed me off. He's a Namekian for crying out loud. 

8. The Z fighters again succumbing to 'Solar Flare'. How do you not close your eyes, it's pretty obvious when he's about to do it, but somehow it gets everyone for the second time.

9. The closing theme song is one of the most painful songs I have ever heard in a long time

10. I am pretty sure I heard Yamcha say "Fuck me" when Goku gave Cell a sensu bean. That was pretty awesome.
If you couldn't tell, I watched the Android/Cell saga.  </TEXT>

And since we would likely end up killing innocent people, I would say 1 year is a bad idea.

	<TEXT> I always seem to miss all the good IPOs. I read today that Ebay and Paypal are splitting up, and Paypal will be a newly listed company on July 20th. I read that [here](https://www.internetretailer.com/2015/06/29/ebaypaypal-divorce-date-set)

So I only use Robinhood to do my trading. Are there limits around IPOs? Will I even be able to purchase stock in the first hour? I've read that sometimes you have to go through brokers to get stock initially. 

Has anyone had an experience getting in on an IPO using Robinhood.

Good point! Only good point I've heard so far in agreement with the ruling. 

I guess the point also is if you have kids you *have* to have a larger house, hence higher property taxes. Also, we have many cases where we give tax benefits for having children, so this could be another benefit. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Religious institutions are welcome to proselytize but not on my dime

It's not on your dime actually. By not sending their children to public schools, they save the public school system money. For my school system for example, it's around $7,000. If you give familes $4,000 for sending their kid to public school, *you have saved $3,000*. 

The simple truth is that it's about money, and nothing else. The state/cities get more money if they refuse to have a voucher system. In terms of cost to the taxpayer, I will rank it for you.

**From highest cost to taxpayer, to lowest cost to taxpayer:**

1. Child goes to public school (est. cost = $8,000)
2. Child goes to private school, with a voucher (est. cost = $0 to $6,000, depending on voucher)
3. Child goes to private school, with no voucher (cost = $0)

The best option for the taxpayer is to have kids go to private schools without vouchers. This is the sole reasoning here. Nothing else. However that is slightly negated - if vouchers were given, *more students would go to private school, thus lowering the cost to the taxpayer*.

Btw even private religious schools must uphold a certain level of secular academic studies, comparable to most public schools. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Kind of bullshit. You pay thousands and property tax. That tax goes to pay for public school. Then you don't even send your kid to public school - which saves the school money. Shouldn't you get back at least *some* of that money? If the cost to the school system to have a child is $8,000 per child - I think it's more than fair to give $4,000 back to the family. 

But to be honest these judges don't really care about the constitution anymore. If they want something, they rule accordingly. In this case, they want money from these parents, so the ruled it unconstitutional. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Using XAMPP and w3fools </TITLE>

	<TEXT> I'm a bit confused on the purpose of XAMPP for better PHP development. Currently, what I do to test my PHP locally is use this command:

    php -S localhost:8888

In the same folder that has my index.php file. I then use the browser and go to 'localhost', and it seems to work fine, my page shows up.

So how would using XAMPP be any better/different? I guess I'm not clear on how I'm supposed to be using it in the first place.

my second questions is about http://www.w3fools.com/. I saw on a wiki here that w3schools is a bad resource. I've never heard that before. Was w3fools made a long time ago? Does it still apply? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Umm, and? Newspapers are for-profit entities. There is an owner, or share of owners that the profit goes to. Religious institutions don't have the concept of profit. In most cases, churches/syngagogues actually are in debt, and can't always make ends meet. I know most synagogues around me have large mortgages, and all their donations simply goes to cover the costs of running. 

I'm not sure how in anyway way that compares to a for-profit organization. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My Ford focus 2013 won't start. It thinks my car is in neutral. Any help?

EDIT: More info - To clarify, the car is in park - but the computer thinks the car is in Neutral.

This happened while I was driving. I was driving, and then all of a sudden the traction control light went on, and I couldn't accelerate. Hitting the gas pedal would rev the car, but it wouldn't move. I turned off the car, and tried to turn it back on, and it wouldn't turn on. No clicking or anything. Seems like an electronic problem, and Ford will fix it in the morning (it's a lease) </TEXT>
