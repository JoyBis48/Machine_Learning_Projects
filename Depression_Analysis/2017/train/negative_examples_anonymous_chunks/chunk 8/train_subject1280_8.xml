	<TEXT> I find VI to be a very great game that takes a lot of what the series has done and improves upon it (like a long standing series should do).
I would go with IV first just because its a little shorter and a great playthrough.
VI will give you great bang for the time spent playing. Personally, my favorite in the franchise. </TEXT>
