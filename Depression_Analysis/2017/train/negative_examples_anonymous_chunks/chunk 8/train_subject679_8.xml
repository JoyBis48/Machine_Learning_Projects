	<TEXT> I'm what I like to call a 'recovering emetophobic, haha. I got extremely sick and it helped to ....desensitize me, I guess, but before that, I hadn't thrown up in 7 years. I read somewhere that Emetophobics learn to bypass the specific breathing pattern that lets your body know 'it's time to throw up' which I think may have some truth to it, because now even when I /want/ to throw up I cant. </TEXT>
