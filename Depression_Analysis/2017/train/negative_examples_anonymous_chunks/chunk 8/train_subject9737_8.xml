	<TEXT> I graduated college when you did and I understand this struggle.I think it comes with any transition phase where we are faced with questions like what now, how can I move on, and what will happen? I have small goals (at least one job application a day, even using mouthwash) and larger, season-based goals like finding a new job or getting an internship. Dividing a transition phase from where you are to where you want to be into tinier pieces may make this easier on you. I think you should take some time for yourself too. Good luck :-) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My dad has a cough drop every night at the same time in the same place. Has to be THAT brand and THAT flavor because otherwise, it isn't enjoyable. Maybe this is out of habit, or maybe cough drops have an ingredient in it that soothes the mind. It could also be the association with cough drops and being sick.. Perhaps OP and people like my dad are soothed by cough drops because they assist in the healing process when someone is sick.  </TEXT>
