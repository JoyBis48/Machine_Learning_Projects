	<TEXT> First, thank you for your time. Eating non-processed foods, there is usually a higher ratio of potassium to sodium than what is normally eaten by modern people (modern diets tend to be extremely sodium heavy with minimal potassium as you know). There was a small but growing body of research a few years ago that restoring this ratio such that potassium intake is higher than sodium intake had a slew of health benefits - reducing hypertension, heart attack and stroke risk, even if the actual amount of sodium consumed didn't decrease. Essentially boosting potassium intake above sodium negated most of the negative health impacts of a sodium heavy diet.

Has there been more research about this? Was it a fluke? </TEXT>

The eggs may not have been super fresh, and as they age they tend to dehydrate (so the air bubble gets a bit larger and can move a tiny bit), so that could be a reason for that. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Recommendations on a great first aid kit? </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hey folks. We are usually base camping or car camping. My old first aid kit is almost entirely expired, and most of the useful stuff has been used up by this point, so it is time to get a new one.

What I am looking for is a good first aid kit that has really good coverage. One built for camping. I'd really like it if the kit has a snake bite kit (PA is known for being super rocky, and we see a lot of snakes on trail). Ideally it should be small or flexible enough to put in a hydration pack.

Anyone have any favorites that they can recommend? 

Or am I just better off assembling it myself and spending a tiny bit more cash? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Anything with an edge can cut you.

True story: when I was in elementary school, while I was in the lunch line with my tray and my milk, a friend snuck up on me. He jumped out to spook me and I dropped my tray. The tray hit the ground and the milk carton bounced off of it. I had leaned down to try and grab it, and the milk carton hit my face. A lunchlady came over and ordered me to go to the nurse immediately. I didnt know why... then I saw the blood dripping. The wax sealing the carton shut had sliced clean through my eyelid, requiring 3 stitches.

My buddy still gives me shit about getting my ass kicked by a milk carton. I could totally see a plastic cup being a deadly weapon :P </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, to be fair, the US and UK created Israel in the 1950's after Britain realized it couldn't control Zionist terrorist organizations that eventually went on to become the Israeli government. It conveniently coincided time-wise with the end of the WWI mandates over massive portions of the region, and provided a great way to keep military bases, and thus influence, in the region. Since we created Israel, we kind of have a right to discuss it.

And before you try to correct me that there weren't Zionist terrorist organizations, google "King David Hotel bombing" and "Irgun." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree that they're dealing with different entities, and the levels may not be the same. 

My main point is that regulators capitulating to the entities they are supposed to regulate absolutely has precedents, especially when money is involved. This happens in the financial industry, in the oil industry, in the mining industry, telecom, etc - every industry. While I agree it may not be to a comparable level, I find the assertion that it doesn't happen at all to be suspect given the precedents.

Your original statement was:
If his book details actual cheating then why aren't they being prosecuted? **Do you think regulators just willingly turn a blind eye to this? Why would they do that?**

Like I said, there are precedents that greed or regulatory culture would motivate regulators to turn a blind eye to malfeasance. That was the statement I was responding to with the example to show that it does happen. The entities are less important than the fact that regulators can and do ignore things that they should be stopping. </TEXT>

Essentially, the regulators do whatever the banks tell them to, and don't question it. I'm not saying it isn't a conspiracy theory, but it has some teeth and evidence to support it.

	<TEXT> So the bouyant effect would be as follows:

HFT firm X sees an order coming in on BATS for 10000 shares of stock Y at 50. Only 50 shares are available on BATS. X sees the order come in, and immediately purchases all available shares at 50 that aren't on BATS, and relists them immediately at 50.05 before shares can be purchased from other exchanges. The market price is now effectively 50.05. 

Another order comes in to BATS at 50.05, and the same thing happens, except relisting at 50.09.

Thus creating a bouyant effect on the market.

I am by no means an expert, so this is probably a gross simplification. But it's the way I understood it and I think it illustrates my concern. Suppose that is 85% of trade volume (ignoring shorting for now)... you could see how that could have a ballooning effect over time. Given the meteoric recovery of the stock market after the recession, it made me curious. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If HFT traders make their money by buying low and selling high with methods like front running, and that is 85 percent of all trade volume - doesn't that mean that 85% of trade volume does nothing more than artificially lift the market price of securities? It creates a constant upward pressure in the market.

If HFT disappeared tomorrow and 85% of trades went away, and 85% of the buying low and selling high went away, without that upward pressure, wouldn't those artificially high prices crash? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yup. But just because they have no fault doesn't mean all divorces are no fault. If you cheat, are abusive, do drugs, are an alcoholic, or (in some states) refuse to have sex your spouse can still get an at-fault divorce.

No fault is for when both parties agree to call it quits. Maybe theyre fighting, the magic is gone, they got married in vegas, whatever. Any amicable reason.

Whether the divorce is at fault or no fault can influence things like alimony payments, triggered clauses in prenups, etc. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Burger purists will disagree with me, but I usually make a panade. For every 4 burgers worth of meat - I like ground chuck - take 1 piece of grocery store sandwich bread mixed with a tablespoon of milk and mash together to make a paste. Work this into the meat. It will help you retain moisture so you don't end up with dry burgers for folks who like them well done.

Shape the patties the day before you're going to use them, and put some dalmatian seasoning on them (coarse salt, fresh cracked black pepper), and let them rest for a day in the fridge.

Get your grill blistering hot, and do about 2 minutes on each side. That should give you a medium well burger. Go shorter if you prefer rarer burgers, but remember unless you're grinding it yourself, ground meat from the store isn't the safest thing to work with. If you grind it yourself, you could do about 1min on each side for a medium rare burger. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, I caught that. I was more saying that at least some punitive measures have precedent. It doesn't feel like a huge stretch that punitive measures could be placed on the 3rd party if they were aware that they were in fact the 3rd party. 

If the 3rd just met someone at a bar who held themselves out as single, then it's kind of screwed up to hit them with those measures. But if they were aware, it actually would make logical sense because that person knowingly damaged the marriage, and is causing the affected partner to be deprived of marital benefits.

I could really see it being argued both ways I guess. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> First, I hope this is the right sub. I haven't gotten a response posting this on /r/AskReddit, so I figured I'd give this a shot. I am just wondering what I am doing wrong or right. I also want to know if there is anything in my plans that I'm not considering.

My wife and I are planning to "start trying" near the end of this summer. My wife has started taking prenatal vitamins at the recommendation of her OBGYN, and she'll be going off BC in late july. I know that timing things can be difficult, but she is a teacher and if we could aim for a due date around the end of may/early june, that would be fantastic because it would maximize her time at home.

We are setting aside a half year's take home pay for her now while we have it, so the money can just sit there and earn interest until it is needed so she can take a leave of absence for half the year, possibly the full year.

I am trying to plan for everything that would be needed, whether or not we are successful. My wife has some thyroid issues, so not having success is absolutely a possibility. We have made a promise to ourselves that we will not seek out any fertility treatments if they are necessary, and we will instead adopt.

We have set up physicals for each of us next month to ensure we are in good health, and that neither of us has an unknown health issue that could impact our decision to proceed.

Thankfully we both have insurance and stable jobs, so that is good.

We'll be redoing our guest bedroom to turn into a nursury/kid's bedroom.

Once I have the ability I want to open a upromise and a 529 account, but I think we have to wait until the kid has arrived before that's possible.

Basically - am I overthinking this? Am I doing things just right? Are there any big considerations I am missing? Are there any moms out there who had bad thyroid issues but were still able to conceive? What kinds of difficulties might we encounter that someone who hasn't been through this before would never think to expect? </TEXT>

They're sweet, and super snackable. They also come with a couple seeds in each, and I was considering trying to grow them. 

However I haven't been able to find much information about them. Has anyone else tried growing them from seed? Are the seeds viable? Are they a hybrid? Would I just end up with a normal bell pepper?

I don't know much about the base cultivar so any help would be very much appreciated. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm waiting for the tread watch to come out. Yeah the price sucks, but the time savings for me makes it worthwhile.

At work I am constantly moving between buildings doing server work, and I almost always forget one tool that I need, which leads to 30-60 minutes of moving back and forth between buildings to get the tool I need. Always having it on my wrist would be more or less priceless for me. Sadly a normal multitool isn't allowed (have to walk through multiple metal detectors and they count them as a knife).

I just wish you could get the band without the timepiece, because I'd pick up something I like a bit more than the timepiece they include in the watch. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sales engineers are usually paired with an actual salesman. Basically you interface directly with a customer alongside the salesman, and formulate a design to meet the customer's needs. Additionally, you prevent the sales guy from selling things that don't exist, which they sometimes do just to close the sale. Anyone who has worked as an engineer knows what I'm talking about ("Sure our product can do x!" "Uh, hey engineers, we need you to make the product do x by friday because we told the client we could do it.")

So, suppose I need a SAN for my company, but I'm not really familiar with SAN hardware. I'd talk to the sales guy and say "Hey, I need to talk to one of your storage guys so I can figure out exactly what I need." At which point the sales engineer pops up. He would figure out exactly what I was looking to accomplish, what my needs were, and then design a solution for me that meets those needs. That designed solution is what I would purchase from the vendor then. Often the sales engineer may also be my first step for fielding minor questions about support on that solution (usually for one off questions, not anything major that would require tracking).

The same thing would happen with software development, or any type of contracted engineering really. It's engineering, but with a sales spin to it. </TEXT>

Police are public servants. Their job is literally to serve and protect. The only time they are supposed to kill or threaten to kill is when it is necessary to serve and protect the public.

When you start treating police like they are soldiers, equipping them like soldiers, and telling them that the public is the enemy, you have a big damn problem. </TEXT>

The problem is, in the years since my last checkup my old PCP has retired and his office closed. I know when you move to a new PCP you usually have your medical records transferred over, but in this case I have no idea who owns my medical records now to have them get transferred over.

What should I do? If I go to the new doctor, can they just start new medical records for me? </TEXT>

Otherwise, you don't really have anything to worry about.

Also, statistically dachshunds, Jack Russels and chihuahuas tend to be the most likely breeds to attack someone.

I have just been playing by doing daily bounties and strike playlists. Since I broke lvl 30 I started receiving constant messages from other players about raids, but I don't have any experience so I'm hesitant to say yes.

So, what do I do next? I'd rather play with a dedicated group of people, but none of my friends are playing on PS3. I've tried joining guilds on the Bungie site, but it's not really clear how to interact with them once you've joined. I've felt uncomfortable using destinyLFG because I really don't like playing with folks I don't know or at least have some connection with (like being in the same guild). Plus the stories on here about people there screwing over others really don't make me want to check it out. I'm from the MMO world where I could usually hook up with a guild and just roll with them through end game content.

I've been scraping together whatever gear I could to level as a striker titan, though if I can get that helm I'm probably going to switch to defender. Once I get geared up I'll start focusing on tweaking to my playstyle.

Any help would really be appreciated. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sadly my wife packs heavy. My concern is a lot of 4 person tents simply don't fit 4 people along with gear. For this trip we will be strictly car camping, however future trips will not. Also, we usually are out with groups of friends, so it isn't uncommon to have 1 or 2 guests in the tent with us. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> 2 week camping trip, looking to buy a new tent, wife has sticker shock - does quality jump along with price? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-06-04 16:56:34 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hey everyone. My wife and I are going to be spending 2 weeks car camping around the finger lakes next month. We have a cheapo 60$ 4 person tent from walmart that has lasted me for a few years. After several rainstorms I am finding I have to waterproof the tent constantly, which has the side effect of coating us in a puddle of water by the time we wake up in the AM due to lack of ventilation. The wife is justifiably concerned about spending that much time in the tent given we will need more "stuff" for that duration of a trip - it could get kinda cramped. We are also looking at having a kid soon, so we'll need a better tent that can better deal with the haphazard abuse of a child. So, we are looking at getting a new tent.

I started looking around at 6 person tents, and all of them on the low price end seemed to have some big gotchas - lack of ventilation, lack of space, flimsiness, collecting water, easily torn, etc. After looking at a number of the big brands I found the Big Agnes Flying Diamond 6, and the reviews are unanimously positive. But the $600 pricetag has my wife in a fit. 

I'm hearing things like "we should have stayed in a hotel room, it would be cheaper." I'm trying to explain that we could theoretically use this thing hundreds of times whereas the hotel room would be a once and done thing, but she's just getting huffy and saying "well, fine, get whatever you want." You married guys know that that means: "DO NOT GET WHATEVER YOU WANT!"

We go camping 2-3x a year, usually I go on one or two additional trips she doesn't because I enjoy the outdoors more. We are in PA, so we have a rather temperate climate and it isn't uncommon for an 80 degree day to yield to a 40 degree night.

It seems like on the low end you have tents that cost 100-200$ but then the price immediately jumps up to 400+ without a ton of middle ground. Since she and I have always gotten cheap tents in the past, we aren't really sure if there is a fitting jump in quality.

She wants to spend at max $200, but my concern is if we are ultimately going to get a higher quality tent (either as an upgrade or to replace one of the cheapos), I'd rather not spend the cash on a low/intermediate quality tent and just jump right to the higher end because it ultimately saves money.

Given the amount of time we spend camping, am I over-preparing? Is this "too much" tent for us? Or is she just fixated on being thrifty in a way that will bite us on the ass later? What sort of difference do you see in tents before and after that price gap? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Pretty much what it says. A family member of mine has been running campaign after campaign on gofundme, stating that they can't afford their bills, that their medical expenses can't be covered, that they can't afford insurance for their kids, etc. These things are all true.

However, after the last one was run, I started seeing notices that the same family member who was so broke was spending a bunch of cash on kickstarter despite supposedly having -$200 in their checking account. Apparently the same individual has also purchased a brand new laptop, and been buying things like crazy on amazon.

If the people who supported them found out about this, what would the legal consequences be? Would this be fraud, or would it be a civil problem? </TEXT>

I am considering getting an audible.com membership. I have about 5 hours a day that I spend commuting, 2.5hrs each way) and for years I have been using librivox (for those who haven't heard, it is public domain audiobooks).

	<TEXT> FYI, pot is capable of causing latent psychological issues to express themselves. It is acute, and once the effects wear off so do psychological issues.

Seeing someone with undiagnosed schizophrenia get high was one of the most uncomfortable stoner moments of my life.

Ultimately I would recommend OP find a sitter for their first time just to be safe. Even if psych issues weren't in play, I've seen people have major panic attacks from getting high the first time, to the point where they had to go to the ER because they thought they were having a heart attack. I personally also sometimes get bouts where my body feels flush and my heart starts to race - at which point I have to stop whatever I'm doing and focus on my breathing to calm my heart back down. If I wasn't as experienced as I am that could easily cause some major problems.

I'm not saying pot is unsafe, but these things do have remote chances of happening. And Im saying that as someone who has been a regular user for well over a decade. For a completely new smoker, it's better to be safe than sorry. Just have a sitter.

Not like OP will get high their first time anyway (unless they go the edible route) :) </TEXT>

	<TITLE> What is the best way to invest/lock up 12k for 1 year? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-05-30 19:10:44 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hey everyone. My wife and I are discussing becoming parents, and we have a rough timeline we would love to follow (we are planning for 1 year of trying, and if that fails, adopting). My wife currently brings home about $2600 a month, and we would like her to be able to be a stay at home mom for at least 4.5 months (half of her working year), up to one year.

We currently have the cash on hand to afford this, and want to set the money aside now when we don't need it in an illiquid account to lock it up for at least 1 year. Then, after she takes her FMLA + uses all of her sick time, it should come available to act as a replacement for her paycheck during her leave of absence.

Right now if we were to put it in a savings account at our bank (Capital One 360) we could earn .75% on that money. I have thought of putting it into a 12 month bond, or a 12 month COD. I would really prefer it be illiquid during this time, both for higher interest but to also ensure that we keep our paws off of it in an emergency (we have a normal emergency fund).

So, are there any other options /r/personalfinance can recommend for locking up this cash for 12 months, and garnering a nice helping of interest? Any help would be really appreciated. </TEXT>

I know most improvising is built off of scales, and the recommendations I've read have suggested either starting with minor pentatonic scales, or blues scales.

Is one better than the other to start with? Are there any really good exercises or books I could check out? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have a LXME which is essentially the same as the LX1E, except the 1 has a spruce top and the ME is all laminate. It is a nice sounding little guitar! Big sound in a little body. I wanted all laminate so I could take it camping, vacationing, throw it around a car, have a toddler knock it over, and leave it sitting out in the open in our den, ALL without having to worry about humidity or temperature impacting the instrument. It has done swimmingly at all of that. Also, I LOVE the stock tuning machines. They're very tight and responsive, almost too responsive. It's very different from my classical.

The biggest cons I have found:

* Switching back and forth between a classical guitar and the 3:4 little martin is trying, especially with pudgy fingers. I have a hell of a time going back and forth. If you are used to playing full sized guitars, especially classicals where your fingers have a little room on the fretboard, you may want to try out the little martin first. So, be prepared to always sound a little folksy :)
* The built in tuner is off by about 30 cents (about 1/3rd of a semitone), and I have no idea how to recalibrate it. The electronics came with no documentation. It's essentially unusable currently. This is easily fixed by a $8 snark tuner, so it isn't huge. I haven't tried the pickups yet so I have no idea how well it sounds amplified.
* I really wish they manufactured them at their Nazareth location. I live about 10 minutes away from their HQ, and would love to see them employing even more locals. On the upside, it keeps my friends who work in their custom shop well employed I guess :)
* Compared to my full sized classical, it weighs a ton. It's surprisingly heavy for its size.

I'll echo everyone else - go into a store where you can try a bunch of guitars out. If you really love the little Martins, you want to try playing both the LX1E, the LXME, and the LXK2 (I think that's what the Koa one is called). Surprisingly I think the LXME sounds the best out of all of them despite being plastic.

I have heard a lot of really negative talk about the Ed Sheeran signature sounding very thin, so I would especially play before you'd pick up that one. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> FYI, at least in PA, having a job doesn't have any bearing on whether or not you have to pay support. This loophole was closed a very long time ago because a deadbeat parent could quit their job and then claim that they aren't bringing in any money, so they shouldn't be liable for support. Obviously, this was an easily exploited problem.

So now your support obligation is based off of your employable worth, not whether or not you are currently earning it. So, if you have a job earning 65k, and then lose it or quit, your support obligation will still be based off of that 65k because at least in theory you could get another job earning a similar wage. While it sucks if you lose your job, at the same time, your kid doesn't stop needing support just because you are now jobless.

Again, this is valid for Pennsylvania as of about 8 years ago, so it may vary by state. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I opened a ticket about an hour ago after I noticed some weirdness. I asked Alexa to play my "BB King station on Pandora". It then tried t find a pandora station for "R B for Kings and Queens," and then apparently found a matching station on iHeartRadio. Destiny's Child started playing, and the thrill was gone for me.

I checked the app and verified that it heard me say "BB King" in the app. It just seemed like after the request was made, somehow on the backend it wasn't processed correctly. So, I opened a support ticket just to let them know.

About 5 minutes ago I got a response that Amazon had received my ticket, they had already tested it on one of their test units and verified that there is an issue, and it the developers were notified of the issue.

All within 1 hour.

Holy hell, I work in product R D and we can't manage that kind of turnaround time for our customers. </TEXT>
