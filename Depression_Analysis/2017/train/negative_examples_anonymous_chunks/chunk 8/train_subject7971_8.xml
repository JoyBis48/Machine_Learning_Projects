	<TEXT> Screw all the keyboard tough guys who are trying to shame publications into publishing stuff they wouldn't have published anyway. 

It seems like a lot of reporters around the world have been killed or have put themselves in gravel peril trying to get the truth out. They and their publications don't have to prove a damn thing.

	<TEXT> You have a great plan. Mandarin is impressive and it should open doors. 

A college newspaper can open doors. It's amazing how many alumni will filter into newsrooms. They will become your first professional network. 

A college paper is a great way to get a taste for working in a collaborative atmosphere. Some of the people I met through my college newspaper have been friends for life, so there is that, too.

Yeah, the conversation is a little lacking. But I suspect if the conversation does pick up, the deniers will be the most aggressive and will be challenging everyone with "show me the studies," crap, just to troll away, and then when that happens, discussion will die down to where it now is.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This blog http://homicidewatch.org/  is a good example. The person who founded it won a Neiman http://nieman.harvard.edu/news/2014/09/laura-amico-nf-13-joins-boston-globe/

the point being is this blogger turned out something useful, targeted and focus, but most importantly, it seemed to me, it had a very clear mission. 

Newspapers don't cover local stuff very much anymore. This fellow http://shortarticlesaboutlongmeetings.blogspot.com/ covers local Neighborhood Advisory Commission meetings (ANC) in DC. Don't know him or his plans, but he turns out solid news reports on these meetings, and his work has been gaining readers. 

Arlington Now was nothing but one guy. The blog is not very old, but he has replicated it in four other towns and his blog is loaded with advertising. http://www.arlnow.com/ 

He created his own foothold. 

There's a real hunger out there for people who actually have local news. 

This was a tiny blog five years ago. Now it's a business: http://www.popville.com/

In my view: blogs that get readers do work. they go out and find out stuff that their readers don't know about. Basically, they function likes news orgs.

	<TEXT> You will be hired in a heartbeat. At a newspaper I once worked at, we hired someone with a law degree who came to a similar conclusion about his career path. He had scant news experience but could write clearly and cleanly (editors love that) His great strength was his analytical ability, attention to detail and fact, which gave his work a lot of precision and intelligence. We loved having him on the staff, and he eventually went off to a job with a big league newspaper. 

That aside, legal training will be a wonderful background for statehouse/congressional reporting. 

Contact a local newspaper, ask to speak to an editor, tell him/her what it is you want to accomplish and ask for some freelance assignments -- just to get three or four clips. Also, don't rule out the plethora of websites that cover speciality news, they may be a way to begin to get traction. With so many layoffs, it's a tough world but there are still jobs and writers who have a solid edge (a law degree qualifies) can find work.

	<TEXT> For their appalling disregard of the truth and ethics in order to get pageviews .. 

i don't know if that's the case here. rolling stone has delivered some outstanding work over the years, It's piece,  for instance, a few years back on the Afghanistan general was solid, gutsy work.

RS should invite poytner or some independent journalism professor to do a post-mortem. It would be instructive, to know how this break-down in fact checking happened. 

The root cause of it has certainly not been revealed, so jumping to a conclusion that the motive was a page view grab doesn't make sense, especially considering RS's history in turning out quality work.

I covered a long federal trial about 15 years ago that got international attention. During breaks, reporters would sometimes check their quotes against one another. I noticed that many of the EU/UK reporters knew shorthand, but the U.S. reporters did not.  

There are many instances outside the court where shorthand will help, especially for on the spot interviews. Recorders can also wig-out the people you are interviewing. 

I couldn't find a place that taught it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's not fine. The Financial Times, an economic and business journal, carried the story on its front page, but with a global angle.  

The WSJ opinion pages are anti-climate change. The lack of coverage in the WSJ print edition may be a consequence of its strident editorial page policy. I think it's affecting and clouding news judgment. 

The protest could have been a jumping off point for a more introspective piece targeted to WSJ readers, such as: How much will climate matter in the mid-terms?

Amazon: You can buy the *2013* physical edition for $10.99, and is eligible for Prime. 

Amazon sells the 2014 edition, but only through third parties. Cheapest was $27, plus 3.99 in shipping, or $30.99

(It seems as if AP has it so you get the best pricing on its site.) 

2014 style guide online via AP: $26 or $16 for members of the AP.  

The iOS mobile edition is $24.99 via iTunes. 

There is no Kindle edition. 

Question: Has anyone used the AP editions for Word, Outlook?

	<TITLE> With interest rate rise ahead, what's the best course on bonds and 401K? </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I am a few months away from 60 and here is my 401K asset allocation:

Small/mid/specialty: 34%
Large cap growth: 27%
Global International: 22%
Bonds: 15%
Balanced: 1%
Large Cap Value: 1%

I've had this asset allocation for about 10 years. Didn't touch it during the crash.  

But I was planning to get conservative, and was thinking about moving about 50% into bonds, 30% into index and large cap; 10% international and 10% small cap. 

However, with interest rate rise seemingly expected, I'm reading now that bonds may be a bad move, so not sure what do to. But with 5 years left to a theoretical retirement, I want to protect myself. Should I stick with my balance/asset allocation plan or try something else? Thanks for any insights.
