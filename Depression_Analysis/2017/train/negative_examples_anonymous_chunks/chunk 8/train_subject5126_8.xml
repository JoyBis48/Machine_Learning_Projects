	<TEXT> I used to run distance in some hot areas, like Guam and Singapore. During long runs (typically anything over 45 min) I'd have to consume salt packets to keep my muscles from seizing up.  They have 'sport gels' for this now, but salt is basically what you need. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yea, I've tried wool caps. They and their effects on your hair aren't a big secret. People who wear them during the hot summer are tool bags; evident in the image of a man needing help from a group of lesbians to muster some hope of success on Tinder. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A bit longer than 15 minutes but "The Situation."  He's going on about building his brand up when now it's a brand that no one can sell. Clubs in NYC won't even put him on the guest list b/c it's so synonymous with douchbaggery. And the clincher is that the IRS is into him hard now. If he'll avoid jail time he'll have to pay out until he's in the poor house. Good for him. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've know NattyFat too! She's such a health expert. And since everything the eats is healthy, the more she eats, the healthier she becomes! Duh, it's SO LOGICAL.

I dropped this story into rant wednesday on rFitness; but she lurks in my works kitchen too.  When I make peanut PB J she'll let me know that almond butter is much healthier and ask why I'm loading up on the protein. </TEXT>
