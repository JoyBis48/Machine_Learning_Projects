	<TEXT> Mustard is certainly a brassica, along with the above list and also turnips, bok choi, and (more distantly) radishes.

If you see mustard greens in the market, you'll see they're similar to turnip greens and kale. And if you ever plant cabbage or cauliflower, you'll see the seeds are very similar to mustard seeds. 

Wikipedia is the one in error if they don't list mustard as a member of the brassica family. </TEXT>

You know, if they'd settled that issue properly, that would have made sense. Neelix and Kes hooked up because of the whole way they met and how she got rescued. This is not such an uncommon story, and oftentimes couples that start this way find out later that they're not suited for each other. 

But they never resolved it properly, which means that instead of a proper story we have... a couple with no chemistry and you don't know why they stay together. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Paris works quite well, though towards the end of the series it's ridiculous how many things they have him doing or being an expert it.

Yes, it is. There's no reason they couldn't have fobbed some of that off on Harry, given him something to do besides lack any form of growth. Harry could've been the more or less competent medic, and we could have seen that all those Holodeck programs were the combined efforts of Harry and Tom together rather than Tom being a good writer and a decent programmer as well.

That's two complaints with one fix. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The Q episodes on Voyager are the only Q episodes I am willing to watch. (Well, other than the single scene where Q get punched by Sisko, that's great.) Which is good, because I utterly refuse to watch any episode with the Borg Queen, so it evens out.

Ugh, the Borg Queen. If she's going to be creepy and sexually repressed, I want to know why she doesn't just modify a drone to... well, anyway, those episodes make me cringe in all the bad ways. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The good episodes could be really good, and there weren't too many cringe-worthy clunkers.

Unfortunately, most episodes were just... eh. They weren't good, they weren't bad, they were simply watchable.

However, I will point out something I really liked, although it's hard to explain why. In one episode on Voyager, the whole crew is going crazy trying to solve this brain teaser puzzle. On TNG, a fad like that had a decent shot of being an evil alien conspiracy. On Voyager, it was just a fad like the last one Paris spread around - yo-yos! I don't know why, but that tickled me pink. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Can you honestly say you'd be entirely happy continuing the relationship?

Well, I'd be a little weirded out, but I like to think that I'm dating/married to this person for who they are, not how they look. If I'm not going to split up with them for getting into a car accident and losing a limb, or for growing older, or for suddenly developing an inconvenient allergy, or for getting cancer, then I certainly hope I'm not going to ditch them for a relatively minor cosmetic change!

How shallow do you think we all are, anyway? </TEXT>

Drives me batty when people throw these things out like we'll all agree, and then refuse to engage with people who don't.

The difference between you and me is *I know people who grew up in households headed by same-sex couples*. I also know people who were raised by grandparents, or by their aunts and uncles, and I know people who were raised in foster care. That last group is the only one that spends much time worrying they would have had a better childhood had they been raised differently, because *any* permanent family would have been better than being shuffled around.

	<TEXT> About 3% of the population of the US identifies as gay or bisexual. 

However, there is a glaring problem with this number, and that's the fact that it depends on self-identification. We just don't know how many people have same-sex attractions but are unwilling to admit it, even on an anonymous survey. Heck, some of them might not admit it to themselves.

Edit: Google suggests that the percentage of people under 35 who identify as gay or bi is slightly higher than 3%, this is consistent with my speculation above. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Picture group therapy.

On the one hand, a mixed group will have a lot of women who, understandably, may not be comfortable discussing their rapes in front of men.

On the other, you have men who as a result of their rape may be feeling emasculated or other things like that and might feel even more uncomfortable by the unspoken implication that only women get raped.

In this particular case, it makes sense to have two groups. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When you're stimulated enough, your body responds, whether you want to or not. A woman can certainly manipulate the penis until it gets hard or even orgasms. Difficult as it is to believe, there doesn't have to be desire for this to happen. There are many cases in war-torn places, for example, where men and boys have been forced to rape their sisters, daughters, or grandmothers. Obviously they didn't want to do this.

Women can also force cunnilingus or anally rape others. </TEXT>
