So, I'm really new to modern pokemon... The last game I played was Ruby and Sapphire so I don't realy know what the natures or EVs mean, or any of that stuff. If any of these are realy good / rare let me know. I'm still getting used to the game and stuff. I also have a bunch of Eevees (like 45) and Fennekins (around 10) at level 1 (all male), except I have one thats at level 56 if you're interested. He's nicknamed Fenneuc or maybe that's just the french spelling of Fennekin. Anyway, I don't want any nicknames.. Thanks! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I really thought it was a leap to have the character actually go and kill the bullies... I mean, I don't know any school shooters but I feel they all must suffer from some sort of mental disorder to begin with.. Homicidal tendencies. I felt Matt was very warm and funny, and probably very like the actor/writer/director portraying him, so, I just didn't "feel" he was the kind of guy who would kill people who bully him. I felt he would go make a movie or do something silly. He seemed way too happy all the time to be a murderer... And he was likable to me as an audience member. when people were treating him like a weirdo nerd I thought it was a little rediculous. he wasn't weird enough for me. he seemed pretty cool actually. The only thing that sort of justified the killing for me was when he was reading about psychopaths and he read the description of them always "lying", and their entire being is just a mask, and even when the truth is easier to tell the psycho will choose to lie just for the sport of it. If he's reading about himself, his friendly personality is just hiding a deep seated blood lust that would have manifested whether it was a Dirty or somebody else... But that kind of goes against what the film was trying to do, say bullying causes [some] school shootings. I don't care how shitty the bullying he was recieving was (and really... It was bad but it wasn't crazy bad... I've seen worse), for him to kill the bullies made him a psychopath to me. He should have just toughed it out for what 1, maybe 2 more years? I had a problem with his nice guy movie lover persona just becoming a killer... I read the documentary crew being in his head which then just made me settle on him being crazy but my friends read it different. I don't think the filmmakers really knew after reading some interviews which I found very dissapointing because I think if you're going to tackle such a huge issue, you need a very powerful strategy, and in the end I'm just sitting here dissapointed after all the hype. Still a good movie, 7.5/10... OH, and the song choices were excellent, and the directing was great. Some really beautiful montages. I look forward to more from Matt Johnson. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No, I liked it, but tonally it felt like a condemnation of Walt, almost cautionary tale-esque, whereas in the new one, he won in the end... Or at least that's how I felt.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I liked it but I don't think it totally worked because Walt wanted to die in some regards, he was angry when his cancer went away, and he was laughing when he thought Gus Fring was coming to kill him and his family, thats why the more upbeat Badfinger song is like Walt going out on his own terms in a blaze of  glory.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> nadia opens the door

a shirtless man is at the door. 

nadia: excuse me? 

man: hello miss, my name is earl, and I was wondering if you had any peanuts? 

nadia: uhm....... 

man: please, miss, it's very important to me. 

nadia: what do you need them for? 

man: i'm a little embarassed, mam. 

nadia: it's 1 in the morning. i don't need to give you peanuts. 

man: and i understand that. but i thought, given all the children's playing toys and such on your front lawn that you must be a very kind person. 

nadia: oh really? 

man: i don't know. 

nadia: i don't have any peanuts

man: yes you do. 

nadia: no, i'm sorry i don't. 

nadia puts her hand on the door to close it. 

man: okay, okay! i'll tell you why i need them.... i live a few blocks from here and i was drinking tonight and my woman doesn't like it when i drink. and if i go home n i smell like alcohol i know she's gonna throw me out. i'm sorry miss. i am a bit drunk. it's just this heat has been so much. and ive been hounded at work. i just needed to let one out you know. and i know i'm disturbing you and all but i didnt realize i didn't eat no peanuts at the bar till i was walking home and all... and... i'm sorry miss. i saw the light on... and the kids stuff... i just thought you must be a nice lady. 

nadia: how'd you know my husband wasn't going to come out and kick your ass? 

the man laughs. 

man: i would have ran, he tried anything on me. 

nadia: wait here. i'll get some nuts.  </TEXT>
