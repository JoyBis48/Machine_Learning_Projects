There's not the slightest indication of any homophobia or discrimination from CAFE. This is ban is 100% political, perhaps even more political than the UKIP ban in the UK. </TEXT>

If the only concern is a few angry phone calls then I'd say the protesters are showing a huge amount of restraint and should be commended for remaining peaceful and conducting the protests in a lawful manner. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Chase's genital mutilation is scheduled for Thursday 11th June at Joe DiMaggio Children's Hospital in Florida. I'm sure I don't need to explain the details of this case, but here's some background for those who are new to it: http://savingchase.org/news 

**Please help to protect Chase by letting the hospital know what they're doing is completely unethical, non consensual and constitutes severe child abuse.**

You can phone the hospital on 954-265-5324

Tweets should go to @JDCHospital and they've posted on their Facebook about the controversy, with the post currently open to replies

There will also be protests outside the hospital: 1005 Joe Dimaggio Drive http://intactnews.org/node/807/1433866992/dr-gary-birken-protest 

    
Please also share various articles about the case on Facebook, Reddit, Twitter: http://www.palmbeachpost.com/news/news/breaking-news/reports-of-boys-looming-circumcision-cause-campaig/nmYwp/  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> To be fair, the number of deaths is pretty small when you consider the number of circumcisions carried out. Far more common are lesser complications from the surgery, such as infections and the loss of all or parts of the penis. You won't exactly hear a lot of guys talking about that either becasue it's not exactly something people will mention for fun is it? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The key men's rights info is found a long way down in the article. It reads as follows:

 Ethan, who was born in January 2012, has lived with his mother since his parents split up in February 2013. 

 Legal proceedings between his parents began a month later when Mr Williams applied for contact with Ethan.

 Magistrates ordered that he should have contact with Ethan in the presence of Ms Minnock from August 2013, but this broke down two months later.

 In January 2014 Ms Minnock made allegations against Mr Williams. These were all rejected by a district judge in April 2014.

 In February, a district judge found further allegations by Ms Minnock had been 'fabricated' to 'frustrate contact'.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Any person (man or woman) who is likely to abuse their partner will not change their behaviour because of a poster. 

I'd disagree in this particular case. You're correct that any poster which simply repeats messages already firmly embedded into the attitudes of society will have zero impact (e.g. "never hit a woman"). Violence against men, particularly by women, is seem as acceptable, deserved and even comedic. Therefore an innovative poster campaign that actually confronts problematic prevailing attitudes is actually of real value.

The posters may not be enough to stop most female abusers, but it may cause bystanders to say something o (or at least not applaud and laugh). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That seems like a pretty ageist statement. Clearly young men are hugely impacted by sexism in society, though there's a hell of a lot of issues for older men to face too. Young men generally don't have kids (or at least haven't' been through a terrible divorce and lost all contact with them (and most of theri money) while still paying child support). Suicide also impacts on old and young men alike and wihle treatment for younger men's cancers is pretty good, it's the older men with prostate cancer who are the ones facing real discrimination and appalling care.

If age rally bothers you, then you'll be pleased to know that (from what I've seen) most of the senior members of CAFE are all pretty young, though tbh I think it's great to have a whole mix of ages (and genders) working together and above all else the best and most dedicated person for the job. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi, I'm something of an expert on Symantec's filter and it's impact on men's rights site. I wrote numerous articles on this issue back in 2013 and complied lists of sites it's blocks as "hate". I've gone right to teh top of the company with my concerns and their policy of smearing and defaming the overwhelming majority of men's human rights sites as "hate" is entirely deliberate and they're not planning on changing the classifications.

Some articles:

	<TEXT> Hi Suzanne,

I really admire how you decided to make shared parenting a part of your manifesto. UKIP are the only major party to do this and I'd really like to thank you personally for the work you've done in this area

There are also a great many other equality issues concerning men and boys, all of which are also totally ignored by LibLabCon and I was wondering if you'd looking into any of these? For example we currently have the genital mutilation of children funded by the NHS (without their consent) and there are vast gender inequalities (all caused by the state) in relation to cancer care, domestic violence support, education and the justice system.

I really feel that if you took the same approach to the above issues that you've taken to parenting, then you'd gain even more support next time around (and of course it's the right thing to do as well). Would love you hear your thoughts. </TEXT>
