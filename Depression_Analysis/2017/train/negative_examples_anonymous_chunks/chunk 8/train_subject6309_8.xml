	<TEXT> Gotcha. Yeah I had a class with 15 kids on IEPs and they put a learning specialist in the room with me. I definitely could have used more direction with teaching a skills based class. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would obviously talk to your administration and if they do nothing, then I would get the union involved.

By the way, a degree in education means that you have training for students in special education. If you don't want kids with special needs in your class I would look for another job, maybe at a charter or private school. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Should I leave my current teaching position?? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> So, long story short...I am a teacher in a low-income/high teacher turnaround district. This past year I have had some unbelievably horrible encounters with my principal and administration(to the point where I have actually reported to HR). After all of this, I am obviously keeping my eyes open for new teaching jobs, but I have some preoccupations about going to a different school because I truly love my kids and I adore the members on my team. I was hoping all of you could give me some advice?

1. Are all principals bullies? 
2. Do all principals/administrators they use their power to intimidate? 
3. Do all principals compare veteran teachers to newer teachers? 
4. What happens at your school when there is a huge behavior/safety concern ? (For example: a student throws a heavy backpack at another student's head)
5. How does your administrator discuss concerns?(i.e. email? text? face-to-face? hallway?classroom?)

**Thank you all for your help!!**

I need some reassurance that there are good principals out there! </TEXT>
