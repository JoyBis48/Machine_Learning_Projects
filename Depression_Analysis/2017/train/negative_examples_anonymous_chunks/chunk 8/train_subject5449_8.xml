	<TEXT> It's really up to the parents if they get their son circumcised. It is way common in America. I'm atheist and I'd do it to my boy if I had one. It is just normal here, and as long as it's done sanitarily I really see no issue. Female circumcision is vastly different, and causes vast issues for girls. Guys that are circ still jerk off, still cum normally, the loss of sensation is minimal (men still prematurely ejaculate with alarming regularity while circumcised). They just don't have Smegma and have less issues with cleanliness. It actually does reduce std transmission. Also, I've had both, and as a female, it is easier giving head to a guy who is circumcised because you don't spend all that time pushing foreskin back, more time spent playing with the shaft. I also know there are men who get the surgery done because of actual medical purposes. Does it have to be done? Almost always, no. But it can cause shaming in the boys locker room when you got extra skin down there. But then, such is the American way. Oh, and a circumcised dick looks visually larger, which is a plus to women. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Welcome one and all to Ground Zero with Clyde Lewis! This is a place where we can get weird and discuss an awesome radio show that I enjoy listening to. Dealing with the strange, paranormal, and macabre, nothing is taboo! Talk about your favorite shows, or just the most recent! If it is paranormal related it belongs right here! Clyde's show is like nothing on the radio right now, his broadcasting skills are excellent! If you enjoy Coast to Coast AM or miss Art Bell, this is right where you belong. If you haven't listened to the show, or it just isn't broadcast in your neck of the woods, you can check out the official website here: http://www.groundzeromedia.org/

Thank you for stopping in, I do hope you'll join this sub! </TEXT>

I'm excited to hear the thoughts and ideas of everyone! I know this can be a great little piece of reddit if we all work together as a community. I'm really new to this, so any thoughts, ideas, or help making the page really great are appreciated. Thank you! </TEXT>

I also know there was a movie made about it a few years ago. But it doesn't hold a candle the true story. Clyde's show on this was awesome! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I appreciate this, but I am seeing posts that show other people are encountering the same issue. Now, I'm no programmer, but I may have a cheap, quick solution to this issue I think everyone will appreciate, a lot. Why not go back into all the accounts you reset and blanket fix the issue. I believe this would save time (so you aren't fixing this bug individually) and it would therefore save money. I don't have access to my boyfriends game info, so I can't just give that out. But I know y'all as creators do have the info of all reset accounts. If you can do this, send me a message, or, put a message in game at startup saying this bug has been fixed. You can even put in a strongly worded message to everyone reminding to not hack or be banned. I know the fans would appreciate this and I think it might help with TinyCo's reputation a bit. It's a win-win. I know I won't be hacking it anymore, and I think a show of faith in that matter will sway others from doing the same. Of course, there are asses out there who will hack and need banning but I believe this could stem the tide of it. Anyways, I appreciate your response to this issue. It has actually convinced me to not delete the game. Good show, sir! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yo, just a little FYI, TinyCo does not share your sentiments

We're looking into this now. If you've been set to 250, then the warning/flag is considered complete.

Did you happen to force close when you saw the original TOU popup?

Also, does the TOU popup still appear when it moves to 250?

If you'd like us to take a look at your account in particular, please send a note to Support and DM me when you do. (I'll make sure it gets looked at.)

	<TEXT> There are lots of bugs with the game itself, it's a smaller, cheaply made TSTO game. If I had money to spend, I'd probably be much more willing to give it to EA just because they weren't douches about the hacking.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh, btw, TripleSkeet, TinyCo messaged me and they actually offered to fix the problem. They were pretty nice about it. I think RyanMercer needs to get off the rag. Maybe smoke some reefer, take a nap. He's way to aggressive about his views, which, as I can now plainly see do not reflect TinyCo's views. Gotta be honest tho, a little nervous about them fixing just my acct. I feel like this, if they can blanket reset everyone's accts to 250, they can blanket fix the problem. I feel like it's a much cheaper and quicker fix. It might also restore a tiny smidgen of faith in the company. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It just sucks is what it is. I don't mind legit banking clams, I have no money beyond the bills I pay and the food I put on the table. I play this game because I find it a nice escape from the doldrums of my day. If they think they are getting my little bit of money for this game, I'm sorry, it just isn't happening. I have none to give. Not for oscillations that as transducer said 'is fucking theirs, they own it, not you'. But if I can't bank clams beyond 250, really, I can't buy much, if anything. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> But he lost legally gained clams *after* the reset by TinyCo. Also, as I've been learning, he isn't the only one. TinyCo is being ridiculously dumb if they think they can just take clams they are freely giving out. I mean, if you give something to someone and then turn around and take it back that is called Indian Giving. It isn't the way a company should be running their business, it will lose customer loyalty faster than anything. </TEXT>
