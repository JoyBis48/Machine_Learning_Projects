	<TEXT> It's pretty much up to you. 

Sounds like you did your due diligence and you are off the hook.

Only other advice I could give is, if it's an older tube style TV, they didn't take to temperature changes well. (Sometimes) So if you left them sit to come around to room temperature they would often start working normally again. 

It's my 2c, good luck!  </TEXT>

Hell No.

How about this...let me actually control MY OWN PRICES! Let me sell a book for .25 and make .24 in profit. Instead of 2.99 and getting .72c of it. 

You are forcing us to make our books stupidly expensive just to make a buck.

Give us authors a chance to control our work and maybe we will be more willing to help fight one of your battles. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It was a long time ago and I only remember a few things...

-It was about 2 guys who tried to climb a mountain? (I think)

- I think one of them died while climbing and the other went into depression.

-He ended up living in an old train car at a ski hill?

-There was of course a woman mixed in here.

-I believe in the end he decided to climb the mountain in honor of his friend. (Not sure)

Sorry it's not much. What I can say so far is that it's not K2, but is from around that era. I have googled extensively, but have come up empty...

Maybe the Reddit hive mind will have better luck?

Thanks in advance!

These have just been re-published, what were the old covers like?

You decided to comment on reviews, even as going as far as calling a reader the grammar police...how is that not biting you in the backside?

I wanted to hate you, but I can't. If you really are making the money you say, it's a jealous problem on my end. I like your latest covers. Simple but nice. Not my tastes, but then again that's why they are my tastes.

It's nice to know a fellow Canadian, and neighbour, can do so well as an indie.

Edit- Sorry are those your books or someone else's? Unclear... </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2014-06-10 19:03:46 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Punched a hole through my transmission last week. So far I am looking at over 2k to have it fixed. Both my kids inherited my wife's jaw problems, we have decided to fix it now while they are young, than wait till they are teens and spend 10x as much. My work, same job for over 20 years, was just hit with a major loss as our CEO and friend passed away. This has shaken the company pretty hard. 

Yep, what's next? I ask myself that too.

So off the top I want you to know, I am not looking for money, at least not directly. I have no problem with earning my money. 
I work hard, but it's tough, you all know it's tough. So I am asking for a trade.

I write books. And I have them available in e-book and paperback. I am hoping that even a few of you might be interested in what I write. It's not a perfect solution, but every sale I make helps out in the future. 

I have seen the power of Reddit do awesome things.

Thanks for your time, and the link to my work will be in the comments. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No disrespect taken! 

After all, I am in the public eye. If I can't take a touch of critisism, well...I best exit stage left. And I agree with what you said. Honestly I typed this up in a rush at about 2 minutes before my head hit the pillow last night. If you are up to a re-read, here is the actual bite from the back of the book. I wouldn't mind hearing your take on it. 


His parents ignore him.

His motorcycle is trashed from the accident.

He has nowhere to sleep, no money left, and no job to earn more.

With few options open to him, Dario's future is dark, and depression is sneaking around the frame of his world. That is until his fingers push through the boundary of the reflection in front of him, and he learns that he can move through a world that others can only see.

Now...can he use this to fix the errors of his past, or will crime be the only option? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Dario woke in a hospital bed. His bike ruined, his family dismissive, and his job now gone. His stay in the hospital now just one more trouble on an already long list. That is until he finds out he can now enter the worlds inside of a mirror. Will this be an escape from the troubles that haunt him or just another thorn in his side?
