	<TEXT>  When historians write about this period in U.S. history, it could very well be that one of the themes will be how the United States lost its global technology leadership to other nations

which nation would US lost the leadership to over this? it is quite clear that all other countries with high level of technology are all doing large scale digital surveillance. British have GCHQ tapping the fiber backbone, Russia have SORM, French just last month pass law to have mass digital data collection , Germany have BND collection millions of phone data and pass along to NSA. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> there are reason why other Samoans dont support this. 

http://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/38okr5/us_court_rejects_american_samoans_bid_for_full/

According to Morrison, many on the island feel that American influence in Samoa had already brought a host of changes, like a population boom and more unhealthful food and lifestyles. "Culture is so important to the people of American Samoa that they have fought hard to shield it from foreign erosion," he wrote. "In so doing, they have potentially given up many rights and benefits for which they would otherwise be eligible."

This is essentially the argument that the American Samoan government made when it sided with the Obama administration in the current case. The brief says that American citizenship would also bring new scrutiny to long-standing cultural practices  like limiting the sale of communal land to people with at least half-Samoan ancestry  that might violate the Equal Protection Clause. It's one of the many thorny wrinkles in a case pitting the preservation of an indigenous culture against a broader call for rights. </TEXT>
