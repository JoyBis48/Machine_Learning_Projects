	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi, my name is Ryan. This is my first time GMing an rpg. I'm looking for new or inexperienced players, but veterans are welcome if you're willing to be friendly and patient with new players. For schedule I'm thinking weekly games on Thursday. Games would be about 4:30pm PST. Session time I guess would be a few hours, I have yet to try the system so I'm not sure. If you're interested send me a message with a way I can talk to you (preferably Skype) so we can discuss things and I can get to know you.
Thanks for clicking and have a nice day/evening. 

Edit: I changed the game date to Thursdays. As of now I'm just not able to do it any other day.

Edit 2: Party's full. Thanks for the help guys :) </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [Online] LFG, Star Wars Edge of The Empire. Fridays and/or Sundays PST(GMT -8) </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-02-09 07:44:42 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hello! I'm looking to be part of a Star Wars game. I've played a couple of sessions of 3.5 and Pathfinder so I'm not new to Rpgs, just this one. I have yet to try out the game but I understand the dice system and the character creation (apart from the obligation point system. I need someone to help explain that to me.) For Fridays I can anywhere from 4:30pm PST to late into the night. Sundays I can go from 1:00pm to 7. So post a comment or send a message if you'd be interested in having me. Thanks for the consideration and have a wonderful day/evening.

Edit 1: Friday is filled. Sunday is still open :). </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [Online] LFG Pathfinder. Fridays, Saturdays, or Sundays (PST, GMT -8) </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-02-04 11:23:00 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hello! I'm currently looking to join a weekend Pathfinder group. I've never played Pathfinder before, but I have played a few sessions of 3.5 so I believe I have the basics down. I'm open to playing any role that I'd be needed in (I don't have much experience with magic but I'm willing to learn). I'd say anytime after 4:30pm PST works best for me, and for Fridays and Saturdays I can go late into the night (I usually stay up past dawn so if you guys are operating in Europe or Asia I can be available). So just comment or message your information, and thanks for the consideration.

Edit 1: For Saturdays I'm available from 12pm PST to whenever, if that helps :)

Edit 2: Alright so it looks like I've found some groups, so unless anything happens with them I think this post is done. Thanks for the help everybody :) </TEXT>
