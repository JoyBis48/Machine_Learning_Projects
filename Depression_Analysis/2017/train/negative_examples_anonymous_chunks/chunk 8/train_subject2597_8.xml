	<TEXT> EMT here. Cops don't need medical training beyond first aid/CPR. They already fuck up the little medical training they have. Their job isn't to make medical judgement, that's our job. Just like why firefighters cut people out of cars, not cops, there's a places for everyone in the system. Mess with who does what and it's a disaster. 
There's literally nothing the cops could do for a seizure. Seizures require drugs that paramedics attend years of schooling in order to gain a license to give the drugs. Best case scenario for a seizure in a crowd- move patient out from the crowd if it is safe to do so, have Medics show up, Medics treat/transport
On a side note, if you witness seizure, time how long it is and move things out of the way so the person doesn't get hurt.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Preview: Beau Gamble, a former walk-on at Colorado, put together this alumni team to band together different eras of Buffaloes basketball. Gamble was able to get at least two alums at each position, including small forward Richard Roby, the programs all-time leading scorer. Colorado should have 9+ players in LA for the first weekend, and with all coming from the same system, itll end up being a tough out for Team 23.
