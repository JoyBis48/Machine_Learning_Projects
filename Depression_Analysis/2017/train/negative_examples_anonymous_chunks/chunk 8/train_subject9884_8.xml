	<TITLE> Mortgages and the consequences of rising interest rates and decreasing real estate value. I think it's important to be aware of the possible implications. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-05-07 10:35:00 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I am considering to buy (in Germany) and talked to my friend to get some advice. He told me that I should consider two points when deciding to get a mortgage:

**1. Rising Interest Rates**

This is obvious for everybody and all you guys probably know this. When you take out a mortgage you not only have to calculate if you are able to shoulder the monthly payments now, but you also have to calculate if you will be able to if interest rates rise to a certain level as soon as your interest rate changes. In Germany interest rates are normally fixed for 10 years. After that the interest rate WILL change according to the level they are at then. So you will have to try and anticipate a worst case scenario and find out if you can still pay your mortgage. Again, this is basic stuff and if you do not take this into consideration yet, you really should.

**2. If house prices drop**

Even though people on this sub might be mindful about point 1, a lot of people in the real world are not. They are (and have been) taking out mortgages for the past years because interest rates are so low. And that is fair enough. However as soon as interest rates will go up (and they will at some point) many of those people might not be able to afford their mortgage anymore and will be forced to sell. Personally I think that many people take out mortgages that are on the limit of what they can afford (because they want the nicest house they can get). As a consequence many people will be forced to sell when interest rates go up. This might lead to a decrease in real estate values because the market will be flooded with property. See Detroit. This will then mean that your security with the bank (your house) loses value and the bank will increase the mortgage repayments because of the increased risk. This might then lead to further house sales and boom! Bubble!

**My message is:** When you take out a mortgage, take the above two points into consideration and make sure that if either happens you will still be able to pay the bank otherwise you will lose your home. I am not saying don't take out a mortgage. Just make sure you consider possible future scenarios. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As the machine is travelling to the future, it is still always in the same place. Therefore whoever is standing next to it should be able to see it because it is not instantly going to the new time, but just moving through time faster. The passenger should only appear to be moving slower depending on the speed the time machine is travelling at.

	<TEXT> Not trying to say other answers are wrong but I believe part of the answer is:

For drunken sex the person who is not intoxicated is being held responsible to protect the intoxicated person (because they cannot defend themselves)

For drunk driving the person who is intoxicated is being held responsible to protect the people on the streets, who do not have a way of defending themselves against a car with a drunk person driving.

When the goal is the well being of the people this makes sense from my point of view. The situations are not comparable because there is alcohol involved, but because the well being of people is at stake and the rules have been made based on that.

I hope I got my point across.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If my TDEE for maintenance is 2100 kcal per day (desk job and no sport considered) how much do I need to eat to bulk? 

I understand that the answer should be 2600kcal. But if I go to the gym 3 times a week, the TDEE calculator tells that I need 2400kcal for maintenance (desk job and working out 3 times a week). Do I need to eat 2900kcal?

This always confuses me and is never made clear anywhere. I do leangains and I need +20% maintenance on workout days and -20% on rest days, but I never know what I am calculating from.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I understand what you say and I 100% agree with the fact that none of these rules are "god given" or simply right. Exactly my viewpoint. Fairness is also a human construct and we should not think that this is a universal rule for the whole universe. 

However I believe that if you are part of a society you should accept the rules and norms of that society. If you do not, then you should also not claim for you the benefits that the society has to offer. Your call. If you claim the benefits and don't follow the rules, I don't like what you are doing and I will express that. Again, such a person should not be forced to do any of what I believe to be correct behavior, but if they don't then I will (and so does /u/pancakessyrup ) comment on that. Personally I think his argument is spot on and flawless. But I accept that it's all a matter of opinion. 

I just want to point out one thing:

I am sure all these people who now say that /u/pancakessyrup is a dick will suddenly agree with him when they have their lives destroyed by a stupid TV show (no matter if guilty or not). Peoples believes go straight out the window when their own ass is on the line. So I can only respect /u/pancakessyrup for being aware of that . </TEXT>

Hansen has the right to do so, but not the obligation. He could choose to let the legal system work and not make the TV show. Nobody is taking that right away from him. It is a matter of opinion. 

However the people he accuses have their right for fair trial taken away by Hansen.

	<TEXT> Sorry to get involved in your thing here. I am not judging and don't care about you. I am just curious:

How would you feel, if a girl lured you into her room and had sex with you when it turns out afterwards it was for a TV show and she was actually only 16 and you are being accused of being a predator on TV. The thing is, maybe you are, maybe you are not. But in case you are not, how would you feel about it?

Edit: The reason why I am asking is: I am sure some of them are predators, and some of them are not. Is it ok to sacrifice the ones who are not, just so you can destroy the ones who are? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think it's nice if people want to start getting into a form of art. If this is your first attempt and you're trying to get better at it, then I hope you will do well. 

At the same time I am guessing you will want constructive criticism. There is one major problem with using an app (or not putting in the necessary effort)

On the left side the tree and the plant should either be completely in focus or completely out of focus. If they are not it ruins the picture. In this particular picture the plant should be completely out of focus and the tree should be in focus judging by how you chose the area that is in focus. If the app is any good, then you should be able to draw on areas that should be in/out of focus. I would love to see how the picture turns out if you change those two points. 

No offense. Seriously.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Might be totally wrong because I don't really understand the fucking movie but here goes:

Her dad is trying to give her that equation right? He seems to believe the best way is to communicate it via morse code. I don't like the idea, but that's fine. 

I found it weird that he is able to manipulate the watch to do this. After all he has been granted access to an extra dimension and not given unlimited super powers. My friend thinks that he manipulates the watch through gravitation the same way he did when he communicated the first message (sand on the ground). Again, I don't like that idea but that is not my point. 

She looks at the watch, recognizes its morse code and has to leave because her brother is coming back. 

Did she immediately understand and memorize the whole thing?
As far as I understand dad was only able to manipulate gravity in that room. I believe the watch should have been useless once she left the room.  </TEXT>
