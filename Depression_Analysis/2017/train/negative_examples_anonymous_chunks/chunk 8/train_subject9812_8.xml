	<TEXT> As the title says, I may very well get back into WoW. It has sort of been nagging at my brain for a while. I have a single level 80 but have no idea what to start doing if I were to pick it up again. I haven't really done anything since Wrath. Any help with what I missed and what I should begin with? </TEXT>
