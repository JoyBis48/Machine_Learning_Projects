	<TEXT> You're right, some of the responses are just... not... anything?

They're not funny or clever, it's just a sentence. Yet they get points.

I guess that's improv for you.

Either way I still watch the show and enjoy the shit outta it. My favourite part is when you get surprised by some of the guests. Did you guys see that recent episode with Eli Roth? That dude was hilarious and stole the show, who would've thought? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I found that losing weight made me exercise rather than the other way around. Initially I  just planned to control my diet and start exercising down the line.

But something curious happened.

A week into my efforts (after I saw the scale go down), I started sleeping better. I started having more energy. I got home from work, sat down and thought "shit, its sunny as hell outside I'm gonna go for a walk"

That has **never** happened before. That's how it started. 4 months later and I'm doing 20-30 minute jogs and loving it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Seriously. That's it.

I was at my place with a few friends. We were watching the game (she was watching from her own place), the second her team got knocked out, I decided to post on her Facebook wall "Hey X, our power just went out, did your team make it through the finals?"

I immediately got removed from Facebook and she didn't return any of my calls or texts. I really did try to contact her for a while and she wouldn't respond. Screw it, she wants to be this immature I don't really want to remain friends anyway.

Reflecting back on it, I don't think I would've appologised even if she asked. In no way was what I said mean or offensive. We had a relationship where we would make fun of each other all the time. I honestly thought she was stronger than that. Oh well.

And adding to that, he she have said "Listen, you stepped over the line. Don't make jokes about my sports team anymore" I would've stopped. But she didnt, she just clammed up and threw the baby out with the bath water.

I have the means to buy a relatively expensive car and I have several friends who actually did this.

I'd rather spend 11 grand on a 3-4 year old car and take decent care of it. I could squeeze a good decade out of a car like that.


As long as it runs and is has relatively low maintenance then I'm all set. I have zero want or need for an expensive new car. </TEXT>

I eat a good mix of food, but much less than before. I'm on a 1800-2000 calorie diet. I only drink water or the occasional coffee.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I started trying to lose weight a little over 4 months ago. About 3 months ago my 8-ball pool team was getting new club shirts made and they needed everyones sizes. We were told that it would take a few months to get them made and delivered. So I ummm'd and ahhh'd not knowing what my size would be in 2-3 months time. At my fattest I was wearing 3XL clothing, so I ordered 2XL because I had no idea how much I would lose.

Well, I had a pleasant surprise today. My shirt came in and what do you know. I'm not a 2XL anymore. Not even close.

I ended up trading it in for an XL shirt and it fits like a glove (maybe even a little loose :D). I'm an XL for now :)

I think it may be time to go shopping.

Edit: Oh wow, this blew up more than I thought it would. Good to see my NSV helped many of you :)

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So myself and 4 others were playing last weekend and we enacted the Rando Cardrissian rule (essentially for each question we draw an additional face down card for each question and if that card wins, then the 'Rando' fake player gets the point). Normally when we play this rule, we get some funny combinations and Rando gets a few questions.

Not this fucking time.

Holy crap, Rando was on fire. He was pulling out crazy hilarious card combinations. Even winning a few multi card questions.

In the end I (21 wins) only **just** beat Rando (20 wins) and that came down to the last question remaining.

It was insane, has anyone else had this sort of luck with the house rules?

If you've not already, you should try this house rule. It's rather hilarious. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well done, that's a huge effort.

My personal realisation? That the concept of 'healthy foods' is wrong.

You're better off seeing food as energy. Most people imagine a healthy diet as a diet which is nothing but foods which are labeled as healthy. 

Could you imagine eating a diet of nothing but fruits and vegetables? I would losing my fucking mind.

A 'healthy' diet should be a balanced one. So eat a mix of foods within your daily calorie budget. So have an ice cream on occasion, have an apple. Why not have chips AND salad with your steak?

Once you start labeling foods as either healthy or unhealthy you end up setting your diet up for failure. I had a big pile of bacon and eggs for lunch yesterday and I'm still losing weight. Because I ate under my deficit.

	<TEXT> You know what? I like Gohan the way he is. Hear me out, pls no downvotes!

To me, he is a trope buster. You know that 'chosen one, must rise to the occasion' trope? Well he turns it on his head, to me Gohan is the audience. Most of us were his age in the early DBZ and we were all wishing we were the son of the great Goku. As the series goes on, he is told over and over about his great potential as a warrior and as a man. But with that comes the realisation of "just because I can, doesn't mean I should".

The Cell saga was my favourite saga of the entire series and this was mainly because of Gohan. I enjoyed the way that his character decided that he didn't really want that life anymore after Cell. He wanted to live his life since his childhood was sorta stolen away from him due to the previous sagas.

In the end, he will always answer the call to fight and defend his world but he won't devote his life to maintaining his power. 

So yeah, they could've made Gohan a mirror of his father but I think they gave him real depth by making him more well rounded as a character. He also answers the question we've all asked ourselves "Would I want to be the son of the great Goku? Could I handle the responsibility? How would my life be affected?" </TEXT>

	<TEXT> On an episode of the Gruen Transfer, someone came up with a hilarious idea for marketing. 

Create a blank business called "9 out of 10 Doctors" and tack their label onto your product.

"9 out of 10 Doctors would recommend Asbestos Chewing Gum" is no longer false advertising. </TEXT>

I was going to make a post, but you summed up all I was really going to say. The above line is my main point.

I have a bit of a man crush on Ryan Reynolds and he truely seems like a hilarious person outside of acting. But he hasn't chosen his movies well **at all**.

The only dramatic role I appreciated him in was Smokin Aces and that's not really saying much.

The dude really needed to get a role with this season of True Detective of something. Go back and do some more hefty dramatic roles.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey guys,

I've been holding off on progress pics for a while now because I don't really see that much of a change in them (my clothes are all practically falling off, it's just the side by side which doesn't seem that much different).

Either way, 4 months in and I'm finally over the half way point for onderland. Still very much going strong. Thanks for all of your help my friends. My next progress post will be in onederland I hope :D

For the sake of clarity, I've been on a 1800-2000 guestimation calorie diet (not counting calories religiously, I just have a general idea of how much is in my food and I budget around it), I'm losing around about 2 lbs per week and as I'm edging closer I'm adjusting my diet ever so slightly. 

I do cardio at the gym 2-4 times a week. It was previously 45 minutes of fast walking with intermittent jogging bouts. But now I've worked my way up to 30 minute session which is 5 minute warm up walk, 20 minute solid jog and 5 minute cooldown. Which is actually one of my goals! **Hooray for NSVs**. 

I know there are a lot of people at /r/loseit who are really close to my stats. **Keep at it**, trust me. You'll wish you'd started earlier. I know I do :)

Thanks for being awesome guys. [Here's the progress!](http://i.imgur.com/V6h1Krf.jpg)

At the end of the day, I've not said a single damn syllable about my weight loss on social media. So only the people who've physically seen me of late know. This is mainly to avoid being preachy (I see some douchy stuff on Facebook about weight loss).

My plan is to make a single post with progress pictures once I reach my first goal, then I'm not going to bring it back up again. </TEXT>

For context I bought an XL hoodie and that fits rather nicely and my 42 inch work pants (which I used to wear without a belt) now need my belt adjusted to the 3rd belt hole. Also, my 3XL shirts are far too big now. I could probably wear an XL comfortably :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Maybe not ridiculous, but it sure was stupid.

Years ago I had prided myself on always taking care of my phone. I've never lost one or damaged one. This was mainly because I would always be careful handling them and I would always slap my pocket where it normally lives before I leave the house or do what ever.

So anyway, one day I was at the GFs place and in my board shorts. Before I dived in, I did the old thigh slap to check that my phone wasnt in either of my front pockets. Not in there, good job train_subject5967.

So I dive in and have a swim. After swimming around for a while and I lean up against the wall of the pool and feel something poking my lower leg.

**Its my fucking phone**. I now realise that these board shorts don't have side pockets but they have pockets at the bottom of each leg. So that's where I logically stored my phone when I changed.


**TL;DR Phone storage hubris cause the destruction my pursuit of life long phone preservation**

	<TEXT> I've only had 1 break up which I could best describe as *amicable* and that was my most recent one.

It was very mature, almost like I was dating an adult.

I sat down with her and had a long talk, she understood and empathised, I understood and empathised with her. In the end, she accepted it and a bunch of our conversation was about how to deal with some of the other stuff logistically speaking. Getting our stuff from each others houses, how to tell everyone etc.

I came away from it thinking that she too was looking for a way out.

What I **can** tell you guys is that if you really don't want to be in a relationship. Leave it. I felt 1000x better after finally leaving and I've spoken to her since, she feels the same way. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I never ever understood people who can't talk to customers. 

7 years in retail has taught me that if you're nice to even the most horrible customers, you end up having a better time with them.

I ended up developing what I call a *customer assistance voice*. Which is essentially if you take your nicest demeanor, multiple it by 2, increase your voice by an octave, smile **a lot** and be overly sympathetic. It's so easy to do that I often wonder if I'm a sociopath.

So when I see people in the service industry who grimace and are rude to customers I find it completely unacceptable. **We get it, you hate your fucking job. But you're in a fucking customer facing job so do it correctly for christs sake.** </TEXT>
