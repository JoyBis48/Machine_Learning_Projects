	<TEXT> Yes it is "being a dick," but social pressure and cultural norms ALLOW them to be dicks. 

When you are desperate artist who sees no way of making any money off your art except getting Taylor Swift level huge, you'll jump at every opportunity. When our culture---see this thread!--says artists are greedy jerks if they don't give everything away for free, then it makes it far easier to McDonald's to leech off artists without anyone caring. 

This stuff doesn't happen in a vacuum.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  I don't think that people will stop creating art simply because they're not getting paid. 

Totally disagree with you. 

1) There are a lot of people who will always do art, but will do MUCH less of it if they don't have enough money to live off it. People white about George R. R. Martin taking years to finish a book... imagine how long it would take if he worked 50 hours a week at a desk job!

2) Anyone who works in a  creative industry for more than a decade can tell you tons of talented people give up and quit because they can't make money. It's not like those people say "waaaah! no one is buying my work so I'm going to quit to spite them!" But rather, they make no money but still have bills to pay so they work a full time job. They get promoted, they have kids, they live a life. They don't have time to make art for free with all of life's other responsibilities.

	<TEXT>  But from what I've read the corporations cause far more damage to an artist than the pirates do.

I agree with a lot of what you said, but to me the piracy and free-content movement has totally empowered corporations. Nowadays, huge corporate bands expect to get art for free! There are like weekly stories about McDonald's hosting a showcase at SXSW and asking bands to play for free, or Showtime doing "crowd sourced" artwork contests where they get stuff for free. 

Corporations LOVE the idea that they don't have to pay artists. 

I mean, you daily read articles from working musicians and authors about how impossible it is to have a regular income from art anymore, yet Exxon, Coke, Nike and the rest are doing fine.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  You can't stop piracy.

I hate to break it to you dude but... you can't stop any crimes entirely. We've been trying to stop murder for centuries and it happens every day! People will always steal, kill, speed, pirate, and anything else you can think of. 

But it is probably possible to decrease crime. 

 So let me ask you, as an artist. Would you rather have more people see (and enjoy) your work but you don't get paid anymore? Or have them not see it at all, and you don't get paid?

Honestly? I think this is a false question. Here's how real life works: people have bills to pay. They have things they want to buy. They have children to raise and so on and so forth. If artists don't get paid, they have to work more--unless they are born rich. This means they have less time to work on their art, or else they change their art to fit the mass commercial market. 

So either society has to figure out how to pay artists, or else only the rich and amateurs will ever make art.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  There may be more to it than just this simple equation. It's easy to say an album or a film got 10,000 illegal downloads, but how many of the people downloading watched/listened? 

Look, I understand piracy. I understand people download more stuff than they consume AND more than they would buy if piracy didn't exist. 

BUT it is also true that many people pirate stuff they would buy otherwise. Trust me, I'm old enough to remember when everyone went from buying a couple CDs a month to buying zero a month when Napster and everything else broke out. 

 We've had a long time where the paradigm for access to works of art is a 'gatekeeper' model - you pay and you take your chances as to whether or not you'll like it (based on reviews, single releases, etc). How many of us have gone to see a film and wished we could get our money back, or even the time back that it took to watch it?

Welcome to everything in life though!

How many times have you eaten a meal that wasn't that good? Or seen a movie that you ended up not liking? Or gone bowling and ended up not enjoying it? 

Why should artists be the only ones not paid though? Why don't you ask for money back when you realize you weren't as hungry as you thought you were? Or ask for a refund from an airline if your vacation is shitty?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  People want food stamps and a basic income, which amount to free food.

I don't think that's comparable. There are not workers who aren't getting paid to provide those things. Government workers get paid. The grocery stores that use food stamps get paid. 

 People want socialized medicine, which amounts to free doctors' visits. 

Again, the doctors get paid. 

But with art, people often attack artists who get paid and say they are "greedy" and evil and stuff. I've never heard someone say a doctor is "greedy" for wanting to get enough money to live on.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>   Books, and albums are often not worth twenty bucks a go,

But do they really cost that much? A hardcover book does, but a trade paperback is more like 15 before discounts--which are frequent--and ebooks, even from big 5 publishers, seem to be more like 9.99 before discounts. 

In addition, services like Oyster give you unlimited ebooks for 9.99 a month.

Personally, I really think 10 bucks is a pretty great prize for a book or album that you can read or listen to for as many times as you want. Like, a movie ticket costs 15 bucks in a lot of places these days and that's only 2 hours of entertainment. Hell, I know people who spend 10 bucks a day on coffee who think that 10 for a book is a "rip off." I don't get that mindset.  </TEXT>

Yet despite all that, people think they are also entitled to get every single other work for free too. No one would ever think that about non-artistic fields (a right to eat at every restaurant for free, a right to get medical advice from every doctor for free, etc.)  </TEXT>

I think this is utter nonsense, no offense. 

What's crazy about today's deal is that people DO want work, they just don't want to pay. If no one wants to read your book, or listen to your music, you really can't complain. But if 10,000 people want to read your book or 50,000 people want to listen to your music so badly they download it illegally, but then they don't want to pay... that's really a problem. I have no problem with people wanting to ignore my work, but I do have a problem with people thinking they are entitled to get my work for free. 

It's not that self-expression is valuable in and of itself, it's that people DO find it valuable and DO want to consume it, yet don't want to pay.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Highly successful authors will achieve a measure of success with anything they publish, but they are still most associated with, and have most of their sales in, one genre

Well, part of that is just a human need to put everything into a simple little box. It's much easier for critics and readers to think of people as doing just x or just y. This is especially true as time passes. As we move on, writers of the past get relegated to only a couple works that are representative. 

How many people have read a Bram Stoker novel other than Dracula, for example? But he wrote a bunch! In the future, lots of authors we think have tons of great works will be remembered for only 1 or 2 and easily pigeonholed as representative of this or that specific style </TEXT>

Off the top of my head: 

* JK Rowling writes fantasy and mysteries (latter under pen name)

* John Banville writes lit fiction and mysteries (latter under pen name)

* Stephen King has had success in a ton of genres

* Lots of literary fiction writers have "genre" books that did well. Colson Whitehead, Cormac McCarthy, Ben Percey, etc. 

* LOTS of genre writers move freely between fantasy, science fiction, and horror. 

* A bazillion writers have had luck in both fiction and non-fiction

etc. 

The only people who seem to have a hard time with it are mediocore writers who just do really formulaic work in one niche.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There are reasons to go self-pub and reasons to go traditional. But the "suits" are gonna have a field day either way. 

Sure, traditional publishing takes a bigger percentage but they also
* Pay an advance upfront
* pay to have the book printed
* Pay for editing, copyediting, proofing, and design
* and (hopefully) pay for some kind of marketing

In addition, they have distribution that gets you into bookstores

Amazon takes a much lower cut, but also does nothing at all for your book other than transfer digital files for essentially zero cents and provide a platform where your book exists alongside 10 million others. That's not that much for a 30% cut! </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  He's not entirely correct about literary awards. From all the data that is available about SFF ones, it does appear that they have a minor impact on sales nowadays, as opposed to how they impaced on the genre thirty, forty years ago. There is, however, still a bump - but what he ignores is that there are awards out there that do change and authors career. The Booker, the Pulitzer, the Nobel - these all result in generous sales and a new audience coming to the author.

Totally. A big award---National Book Award, Pulitzer, Booker---can have a HUGE impact on the sales of a book, especially if it is a low selling book. 

Here's an article on it: http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/awards-and-prizes/article/51573-just-how-much-does-a-pulitzer-prize-help-a-book-s-sales.html

It cites Jennifer Egan's Goon Squad more than tripling sales for several months after the win, and presumably that had a long tail effect. Paul Hardings Tinkers went from a  book only 1k people had bout to a book that's soon sold over 300k.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I guess what I mean is, I wonder if the issue---without knowing the books obviously---was less that the authors didnt' spend 10 years honing and more that they didn't build up the connections and platforms and/or put in the work to make the books a success. 

Anecdotally, I lot of my friends have started pretty promising careers publishing their first books in their mid/late 20s or early 30s, but they did it smartly. 

You are right that the midlist is dead though, especially for genre fiction. (For literary fiction, you can sustain a career teaching and such while selling at a midlist level and htere are presses dedicated to putting quality low selling work out.) </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  I read every single post on Dean Wesley Smith's site about publishing and it comes down to the same thing. Write more books.

This is generally true, but not always true. 

Jonathan Franzen is one of the best selling authors in recent history (not quite JK Rowling level, but his last two novels were in the top 5 best sellers the years they came out) and he only puts out a book every few years.

	<TEXT> Is "being paid" really the only goal though? 

If you want to write and be paid, your best bet is to be prolific... writing non-fiction, probably for corporate newsletters. If you want to be paid writing fiction, your best bet is to write as quickly as possible without editing and pump out erotica. 

Nothing wrong with any of that, but I think we should keep in mind that there is value to writing work that you love, editing it carefully,  rewriting, and putting something out in the world that you generally feel needs to be there.  </TEXT>

There's a reason we need fiction writers, creative non-fiction writers, and journalists to translate the "facts" of scientists, mathematicians, etc. 

I think the question is impossible though since it really depends on the audience how you can persuade them. Well, maybe that's the key: know your audience.  </TEXT>

With **A Dance With Dragons**, the publisher announced it was mostly completed and being they were working on it on March 3rd, 2011. The book came out July 12 2011 after a huge rush from the publisher and Martin. So 4.5 months last time. Probably a good gauge.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If a book was literally 100% finished and proofread and copyedited and everything, a press could probably turn it around in 2 months. The printing process would take about a month, the shipping a week, and a few weeks to get the cover and other stuff in motion. Just a guess.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, in general books take a year to two years to see publication. It depends on when a publisher can fit the book in their schedule, there is more that goes into the planning than just when a book can come out quickest. Different books do well at different times, and you don't want to "compete" with similar books. So a big book of literary realism won't want to come out at the same time as a new Franzen, for example, especially if the same publisher is putting out both. 

But even if there is an open slot, it normally takes a few months to edit and proof, and then typically books are sent out to reviewers as "galleys" 4 to 8 months ahead of publication. This is to build buzz for the book and to allow reviewers to turn in reviews (many magazines need reviews written and ready a few months before hand.) 

**All that said...**

for a book like The Winds of Winter that will sell great no matter what there is no really need to worry about buzz or even advance reviews. AND since the publisher will want to put the book out ASAP to capture fan interest, they will slot it ASAP. So all the above concerns aren't much of a worry.

So that really means it is just a question of how long it takes Martin and his editor to do the edits, plus how long it takes to get the book printed and shipped to stores. I'd guess at least 3 months, probably more like 5. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Paying only for what can hold our interest will hopefully allow more differentiation among the level of quality of books I download. 

Why is that your assumption? I assume the exact opposite: only the same kind of books sell really well (mass market page turner fiction is very repetitive, just like reality TV, pop music, and blockbuster films have a very narrow range  of work). 

This model will probably make everyone write in the same kind of straight-forward prose, the same short cliffhanger laden chapters, etc. etc.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Huh? I think you are confused here. This has nothing to do with selling more or less books. It's about how Amazon allots money in their unlimited subscription service. Before, they gave everyone the same amount of money if somene completed something like 20% of the book. Now it's all based on pages. 

It's like if Netflix payed TV shows per minute watched instead of per season. 

Netflix and Kindle Unlimited are subscription services with unlimited access to the content they have. They aren't selling more or less books here.  </TEXT>

Ate a big lunch and don't finish your burger at dinner? You don't pay the restaurant half prize. 

Get a call and have to leave the baseball game you attended? You don't get a refund on the last third of your stadium ticket. 

Only play 3 holes at the putt-putt and get bored? You don't get your money back. 

Granted this is currently just a program that doesn't encompass all that much work, but if this is a wedge meant to be moved to other programs it is really problematic.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  It wasn't until late in his life that he performed for King James.

King James became the official patron in 1603, Shakespeare died in 1616. Most of Shakespeare's big plays were in that time (King Lear, MacBeth, Othello, The Tempest, etc.)

Shakespeare's first play was 14 years before King James was the patron. So 14 years before, 12 years after (for last written play.) Basically half his career was that. 

But anyway, before the King was his patron the Lord Chamberlain was the patron. 

Honestly, a theater crowd in a big city is not really "literally the masses." There isn't really a way to compare any artist from Shakespeare's time to modern mass entertainment. How many people do you think went to the Globe during Shakespeare's life? Surely only a fraction of the people who have purchased a Harry Potter book, listened to a Beyonce song, or watched The Avengers. (London's entire population was less than 200,000 in Shakespeare's time.) Mass culture literally didn't exist back then. The technology wasn't there to distribute it. 

The Globe certainly had city dwellers attending, but Shakespeare also preformed for nobility. Certainly you can say Shakespeare wrote for both the masses and the elites, but you can't say it was only the former.

	<TEXT> No, it doesn't stand to reason that infinite drafts would make a work infinitely better. Many of the great works of literature were written overnight with only minor revisions (Kafka's The Judgement is one example, also Ginsberg's Howl allegedly). The draft fetishism of contemporary writing is just that, a fetish. 

It's not that flaws improve a book per se, but that what many people think of as a "problem" is often what makes a book interesting. Like this thread is filled with people wanting to "fix" great books by removing what makes them unique and making them more like standard commercial fiction books.  </TEXT>

 And then they don't put bookstores everywhere.  

Even at the height of the video store game, my hometown had at least as many bookstore as video stores. Now, there is only one video store (that I can think of) and still over a dozen bookstores. 

 The biggest difference is that almost everyone watches movies, but most people don't read. 

The first stat I find says 76% of adults read at least one book in last year. That's not great, but most Americans DO read even if it is only one book a year. People certainly watch way more movies than they read books, but OTOH we are talkinga bout video rental stores. Most americans pre-Netflix era probably just watched TV and went to the cinema now and then.  </TEXT>
