	<TITLE> I'm planning a motorcycle trip across Vietnam for all of September. How badly am I going to be affected by the rainy season? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> This is the beginning of a six month trip I'm taking across SE Asia. I wanted to start in Hanoi, spend some time in the north, then head into Laos and travel the Mekong river (roughly) and end up in HCMC by the end of September. 

I was supposed to start in June, but life kinda got in the way so I had to push it to September. I know it's not an ideal time to go, but is it bad enough that I should spend September somewhere else?

Thanks a ton to anybody that responds; I haven't had as much time to plan as I was hoping, so I get the feeling I'll be asking you guys a lot of questions in the next month! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Helmet's fine, I bailed at just the right time. Half a second later and I'd have been in the same tree!  Watched a little of the gopro footage, my face when I realized it was still rolling is priceless! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Couple of bruises, nothing bad. The Gopro footage is crazy! I'd post the video, but I'm still on the road with no computer </TEXT>
