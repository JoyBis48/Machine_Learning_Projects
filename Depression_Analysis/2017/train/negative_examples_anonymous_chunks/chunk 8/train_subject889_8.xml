Just this afternoon I had a minor joyous meltdown in my front garden because some random plants I had turned out to be daffodils...my favourite flower. Daffodils don't grow in QLD.

I love it here and I am glad you do too </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you actually challenged a 7 yo with the topic of inequality you would be surprised with what they think. 

My niece asked my sister a little while ago "why those two men were kissing". My sister told her because they loved eachother. She was ok with that.

Fast forward a few weeks when the SCOTUS ruling came out and she asked me what all the rainbows were in my Facebook. I explained that some people don't like it when two men or two women kiss and want to stop them getting married. The rainbows are put there to show that we don't want to stop them getting married.

She asked me, without prompting, why they can't get married and I told her that because people don't agree with it and don't think they should.

"But they aren't doing anything wrong! They love eachother and people in love get married!"

Even 7 year olds can understand the basics of equality. Give them a little credit. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Caramel is great. Put them in the fridge for a while and the gooey caramel bit in the centre goes chewy and it is awesome.

The black forest and dark chocolate ones are also very good because dark chocolate just works with the biscuit.

The white I am not fond of.

But overall, I just can't go past original. Bite both ends a little to expose the biscuit then shove one end in a hot chocolate and suck on it like a straw. Heaven! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Honestly, coming from QLD, the weather ain't so bad.

Sure, winter is cold and a little wet but summer is gorgeous! Mild, dry days and warm nights with sunlight stretching to 9pm.

QLD winters are chilly, like a Melbourne Spring but Summers SUCK! Hot, sticky days where the only relief is a summer storm that has a large chance of just fucking your shit up! And when it rains down here, it rains a little then it gets bored and leaves. In  QLD it rains for *days* and *days* you can't escape the hot dampness of it and just when you think it can't rain any more...it rains some more and then floods fuck your shit up!

10/10 would move to Melbourne again </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Something like this happened to me, cept I was the crazy animal lady.

Hear me out!

A few years ago, I got a new puppy. A tiny little foxihuahua no bigger than a coke can. After having him for only 1 day I quickly found that my yard had a big design flaw that he exploited easily, and escaped from. So, I had to go to the shops to buy a some items to fix it...but I couldn't leave him home alone or he would just escape. So my only obvious choice was to take him along.

 After walking around the centre for a little bit, I quickly realised that every man, woman and child was going to stop me every 10metres to squee at my puppy, so I safely showed him in my big tote bag, bundled up in my jumper, where he promptly fell asleep. 

Jump ahead to me exiting a store without making a purchase and the attendant stopping me to check my bag (regular thing, he wasn't suspicious). I didn't really know what to say so I just nodded and opened the bag revealing my tiny, sleeping puppy.

The man paused, took a moment to comprehend what he was seeing, and then asked if that was a puppy in my bag. I said yes, he let out a little squee and then let me leave.

Moral of the story is, if you want to commit petty theft, bring a puppy along. It will distract security from the stolen items hiding in your pockets.
