	<TEXT> I see them, too. The place I work is doing civil for some redevelopment. There are big problems in Balt with underground utilities and the concept of re-using existing row home frontage.

The Balt city government did a massive public works project a few decades ago and "upgraded" the city water mains. That is in scare quotes because they used reinforced concrete for pressurized mains. At any given time, there is a major road closure because the pipe has popped. Any redevelopment needs to address this and that means it only makes financial sense to do work an entire block at a time.

When people drive through the empty parts of the city, they see the backs of buildings burnt out and the fronts mostly fine but boarded up. Many of these shells could be refilled with a home. It is a waste of time, though, because of the structure of the blocks. First, there is very little hope for anyone to use these mass-produced buildings for small business. The lot size and access are not there. Second, you would have to get the zoning changed and to do that you would have to get grassroots support. While you are doing that you might as well get an entire new government elected. I've been in those offices and met those people. Plenty are capable and confident, but the private development process is not lean by and stretch or chew. Third, the streets are too wide. Three to four lanes of sometimes considerable car traffic will kill any neighborhood. The frontage needs to be closer and the streetscape needs to put the pedestrian in charge. While you are doing this, you might as well shorten the short side of blocks and add a few northing roads, or make square blocks with courtyards.

Bonus problem: MD RT40 "the highway to nowhere" is a 50ft deep cut that bisected a thriving black community when it was built. The city fell hard after that for various reasons, but since it did not much redevelopment and infrastructure restructuring was completed in the area - leaving the area filled with owners but the need for massive changes.

Bonus problem #2: Flooding and storm drains. the watershed for the streams that run into the harbor are concrete, now, so they flash the water down. The city needs some greenbelts inside the limits.

Bonus problem #3: The highland hills. Baltimore is not flat. I'm not talking about the potholes, but some of those statistically contribute to elevation variance IMO.

Bonus benefit: There is enough property to redevelop in the city to spur billions of dollars in growth. Get a good amount of three to five story buildings and you can bring in local mass transit, so leave room for future trolleys in the streetscape.

Bonus benefit: Urban farming. Baltimore has many parks, community gardens, and entrepreneurial farmers. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>   They know it will destroy the system and they benefit from the system.

What makes you think your system won't be destroyed, too? Rhetorical.

 but if the government can't solve the issue of greed certainly the 'pure market' (pure greed) can't solve the problems of greed either but will exacerbate it. 

Government initiates force with relative impunity. That is the difference.

 Whereas capitalist logic sees accountability as harming the freedom of the owners of capital.

I just wrote about how accountability is essential.

 Other people are just leeches on their success. And what is wrong with them buying and selling favors, when they are the successful ones and us the poor losers?

Is this an argument about how accountability is not essential? It is a straw man.

 always give the advantage to whoever has the most money rather than who is wronged. 

Always? What about reputation? Not between company and simple passengers, but in between companies. The insurance will suffer, the stock will suffer, any professional clientele of the company will feel like there may be less fairness if something goes wrong. Once people are accountable for teir assets, it is not smart to let another company manage them in any way that you won't be able to bring to justice in court. People who rely on that compnay for services will go elsewhere.

 they still have to raise the money to begin with. Which most people cannot feasibly do.

The funds are high right now because of a barrier to entry and the incomprehensibility of the law.

[The role of soil organic matter in sustaining soil fertility](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v371/n6500/abs/371783a0.html)

[Environmental and Economic Costs of Soil Erosion and Conservation Benefits](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/267/5201/1117)

Fertilizers do not increase soil health, merely nutritional availability for plants. There is just as much erosion on an unfertilized field as a fertilized field - all else the same. Without the mycological and plant root structures, the microscopic pockets of air, the microorganisms... Soil is just dirt. Yields decrease and chemical inputs have to go up to compensate for both the lack of inherent nutrient and the increased amount of runoff pulling chemical additives away from plants.

[Here is a visual example](https://youtu.be/nhVWNwCRpKg?t=25m35s) at 25 minutes.

And don't even think about dredging rivers and ports for eroded soil and shipping it back to the fields. It takes billions just to dredge a 14 mile stretch of river with heavy deposits behind a catching dam. </TEXT>

No, the consumer did. Every transaction in a market attempts to pass the cost of supply onto the demand. At some point in the chain of supply there is a wrinkle, like I said. Proper pressure is not being placed on the grower when he comes to the wholesale market. </TEXT>

I am well acquainted with both the argument you are trying to make and the nature of pre-industrial farms. Modern farms are very different. Farmers and stock do not live in the same conditions, both are improved. Farmers use technology when it makes sense - such as automation, transportation, health, and various sciences. The fact that a farm does not offload bad costs is not a function of decrepitude of practices and conditions.

Better stated: they have no objective to avoid it because there is no cost to throwing it away. We will agree this is not a free market growers are operating in, and there are social trivialities being reinforced by other factors in the supply chain. </TEXT>

Besides that, the professor in the video (whose book I have read) mentions charts of data about half way through the lecture (at thirty minutes). These charts are made from modern studies on erosion. There are four sets, Agriculture, Mountainous, Soil-Covered Land, and Cratons (or extremely flat areas). I have listed them in order of maximum erosive potential. The most degrading agriculture ever measured was more erosive than a glacier scouring land. You know what dug the Great Lakes? Glaciers scouring the land. The chart does not show soil building, which can be measured separately but cannot catch up to the greater erosion rates. Even a forested hilltop will slowly crumble away.

Durrr, I'm sorry I'm so dumb. :P That's totally not what I meant./s Obviously. But in comparison it is extremely promising.

 Not everyone can afford grass fed or USDA Prime you know.

... we both know why they can't, if you're here - but still: Anything not grass fed is simply worth the cost of protein and fat chemicals available for ingestion and less than that for the undesireable content. Just because the economy is leaking like a seive to regulation and tax doesn't mean eating bad food is normal all of a sudden.

The population growth subsidized by the subsidization of industrial agriculature is a cost of statism as well - don't forget that. People make different decisions with different incentives.

 You mean all farming.

There are farms which add value to anything they associate with. The air is clean, water runs clear, and the soil is healthy. People feel good there and the produce is superior. Open field monoculture negatively affects the value of everything associated - barring the produced goods.

 When you figure out exactly how many units of each product will sell every day, you let the supermarket owners know. Until then, your contention that they are all somehow making the same mistake when they could destroy their competitors by improving is just silly.

With your determined lack of imagination, I must wonder how you can even comprehend the market. Truly - you are a boggling mass of writhing incomprehensions.

	<TEXT> No, there is no democratic accountability. That is a lie. Every politician but the rare exception either has a personal agenda or is bought off. - and if that does not weigh a decision the vote is up for trading for favors with others. If you meant regulation by departments, well, just look at the revolving doors at the executive level. The regultory departments are useless for controlling or prosecuting anyone with a fortune. No bankers, CEOs, or anyone else suitably connected goes away down the river.

 (as opposed to taking everything to court which punishes the victims of these negative externalities with exorbitant costs for legal fees)

This is a simple tort reform issue where in some places a losing defendant is not made to pay the plaintiff's court fees.

The market isn't failing when it comes to negative externalities - the precedent has simply not had a chance to catch up to the science. In the days of railroads the companies were sued for starting fires with the sparks from their engines' smokestacks. After losing to ranchers, farmers, and old ladies the companies added spark catchers. We've come a long way since then but the government has gotten in the way of the courts.

 Even small business owners do not want to worry about losing their house because something bad happened at their store or restaurant. 

This fear exists because of both a litigious streak in modern society enabled by bad, morally relative, law and a loophole-ridden tax system which people use limited liability to protect themselves from (some, as they try to game the loopholes). But don't turn your nose up at the small to medium business owner who tried to loop a loop put there by a large corporation as a political lobbying job.

 Capitalism requires this and other actions by the state in order to be somewhat stable, moral hazards and abuses be damned.

If we laid no hands on the free trade of goods, services, and ideas, people would be personally culpable to the actions of their company properties - including stakeholders - and systems would be available to address these matters and enforce them. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Organic farmers have just recently shown higher profits than conventional farmers.

Alternative methods include incorporating cover crops, using a seed drill instead of plowing, alleycropping, forest gardening, and grazing animals over the fields. Some organic farmers still use pesticides and herbicides but use ones approved by third parties to meet certain guidelines to protect the environment, farmer, and consumer.

Meat production is done industrially as well. When compared to well-raised meats, it is sickly, anemic, and has a poor nutrient profile. That is a cost on the consumer and supporting it in any way is a cost on the taxpayer.

Industrial farming generates other externalities in the environment, consumer, and farmer which are not costs passed on to the consumer. They are shouldered in various levels by everyone.

I don't advocate emptying buildings and ending business sectors and crap, but I do think that if food costed the true price we wouldn't waste a third before it reached the supermarket and not a small percentage after that. The landfills of California are filled with perfectly fine produce that simply didn't get sold at the right price. That is a large efficiency which means there is  wrinkle in the market that can be ironed out. I think government subsidies stand in the way. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There is substantial data on soil erosion by open field agriculture all the way back to the desertification of the fertile crescent. Our ancestors cut down all the trees and tilled all the soil until it ran into the rivers and silted them up, then once the land was purged of organic matter it stopped holding water to regulate rivers and became desert with flash floods. This happened in Greece, China, Asia Minor, the Tiber River valley, and almost happened in the American Colonies. Ur, Ostia, and Joppatowne were all ports - now they are 150, 20, and 3 miles inland, respectively.

Oh, and the cities buried in the Sahara were screwed by a change in the axis of the earth. Its there in the archaeological record.

And usually the dirt floor bottom. How high it gets taken is another matter and it doesn't have to exist in a vacuum. If I wanted to make backpacks that were straight-up permaculture based I would need a town of 1,000 behind that to accomplish the specialization, demand, equipment, and supplies. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There is very little compassion in the way people conduct business, today. That is true. Nestle's water crimes and big oil's world-warping effects are extremes of scale - but not conscience. You can find the same cruelty of externalizing costs to society in every town and city. People think they are not responsible for the pollution and waste and poisoning of our physical and social space as they go about their jobs, but the people making decisions certainly are.

As a Catholic libertarian I want nothing more than to be able to tell people that limiting liability through a contract which relies on some government to stop responsibility passing onto the owners is ruining the market all the world over. Companies hide so much in beareaucracy and fed-propped national banks that there is no accountability and they are sucking up the money as fast as it can be printed. To quip: socialism for the rich. It works out quite well for them, though they enter into it actively, voluntarily, and with full control over the government - which is the only way it would work at any scale.

There is a philosophically classic view of humanity which defines morality and natural rights as they are described by the indeniable truths which relativism in all forms (not academically physical) strives to deny. [However, every time it tries to deny one truth it leans heavily on all the others.](https://youtu.be/Lgcd6jvsCFs) To act human is not to act rationally, but to attempt to do so through whatever haze of explanations life has given you. It is wonderful when a person stumbles through the haze to a path which leads them to objective morals and subjective material value because those are a [understanding rather than an explanation.](https://youtu.be/l_VYCqCexow)

My answer is basic, though leaves the implications not enumerated.

Corporatism is due to entrenched relativity of the responibility of property and employment contracts.  Consumerism is due to a lack of meaning and understanding in human lives. We can probably agree on the current situation, encapsulated in those two statements. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Certified Organic is known for not being the most natural. It is used by many people with more money than heart to buy into the Organic market without even having to stop spraying or paying their corporate sales reps. There is no reason Whole Foods' new program should be liable to simply stamp an OK on CO crops. Pay no rents, John Mackey, but why didn't you just start an independent certification business outright?

Here is the letter from CI: [PDF](http://cornucopia.org/Letter-to-John-Mackey-6-23-15.pdf)

Might very well be funded by people who don't like being called out on practices not as organic as they try to sell their crops or the companies that sell the chemicals and equipment. It is natural to complain about having to change practices to adhere to *another* set of standards - and CI is taking advantage of that to attach their less reasonable demands to.

It sounds like Whole Foods is trying to give their customers the ability to pay up front for what would otherwise be an economic externality on the farm side with this system. That isn't CO's goal. Maybe these farmers should drop the CO label and settle down with Reasonably Grown. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  August 25, 1814 in the early afternoon, a strong tornado struck northwest Washington and downtown. The severe  tornadic storm arrived the day that the British Troops had set fire to the Capitol, the White house and other public buildings. The storm's rains would douse those fires. The tornado did major structural damage to the residential section of the city. More British soldiers were killed by the tornado's flying debris than by the guns of the American resistance.  The tornado blew off roofs and carried them high up into the air, knocked down chimneys and fences and damaged numerous homes. Some homes were destroyed. It lifted two pieces of cannon and deposited them several yards away. At least 30 Americans were killed or injured in the heavily damaged buildings and an unknown number of British were killed and injured. (Lat./Long. = ...)
