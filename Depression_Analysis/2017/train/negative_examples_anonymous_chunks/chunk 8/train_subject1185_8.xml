	<TEXT> 5 Centimetres Per Second is a beautiful and unique romanitic film.

The Garden of Words is by the same director, but it's not as good.

Lost in Translation is an odd one as there's nothing particularly special about the way it's shot, but it looks beautiful.

Wes Anderson has a keen eye for visuals, I'd recommend The Grand Budapest Hotel, Moonrise Kingdom and Fantastic Mr Fox.

I haven't seen it, but I hear the Assassination of Jesse James is quite pretty.

This is probably not what you're looking for, but the works of Edgar Wright rely on visual humour a lot. The best examples of this are seen in Scott Pilgrim vs The World and The Three Cornettos trilogy.

It's probably in part due to the general atmosphere, but there are some shots in The Good, The Bad and The Ugly that are so hard sketched into my mind.

And finally, the obligatory not a movie comment - Hannibal, Pushing Daises and True Detective. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> The Garden of Words is a beautifully animated Japenese film directed by Makoto Shinkai. It's about a teenage boy who falls in love with a young woman he meets at a park bench every morning. The animation is phenomenal and it has a similar nostalgic tone to Lost in Translation. The dub is surprisingly good and the actors carry a lot of emotion, in case you didn't want to watch it subtitled. It's only 45 minutes, so don't be surprised if you find it short.

[Here's the trailer.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoA4vYlfoc4)

Edit: I forgot, there's a crucial post credits scene, that you really can't miss otherwise you miss the payoff for the past forty minutes. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Decent list I guess. Some things I don't like, but that's expected. I personally would have included Eden of the East, Hunter X Hunter and some movies. Akira, GitS, 5 Centimetres Per Second, Princess Monoke, Spirited Away and The Garden of Words would be my main picks for movies. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> What if Kendrick Lamar really did kill someone? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-06-25 16:33:02 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Completely pinched from this [source](http://www.djbooth.net/index/news/entry/2015-04-20-kendrick-lamar-kill-someone), but I really wanted to share it.

 He watched House Party and ate Apple Jacks, sold Sega games while his cousin sold crack, pumped Reeboks while his uncle pumped packs. Since his introduction to the world, Kendrick Lamar has been the good kid from an ugly city. He embraced his roots, accepted being a boy from the hood, painting himself as Tre instead of Doughboy. Since birth, he was inducted into the madness. Weve seen the album cover, a baby at a table with a 40 next to a baby bottle. Heard the tales of his homies, how he witnessed their departure into darkness. He couldve been them. Somehow, he stayed away from the gangs. Kept his head in a notebook instead of rolling up papers. He left Compton untainted, a survivor, and told the world his story. Just as Obama became a symbol for hope when he was elected, Kendricks story has made him into an example for kids living in the same jungle. 
 
 What if Kendrick wasn't always so good? What if something traumatic happened that changed his life?
 
  *Been feeling this way since I was 16  The Blacker The Berry*
  
  *If I told you I killed a nigga at 16, would you believe me? Or see me to be innocent Kendrick you seen in the street*  M.A.A.D City
  
  *So why did I weep when Trayvon Martin was in the street, when gang banging make me kill a nigga blacker than me*  The Blacker The Berry
  
  *As a kid I killed two adults, Im two advanced*  Hol Up
  
  *My innocence been dead*  Ab-Souls Outro
 
 When Kendrick sat down with Rob Markman of MTV to discuss TPAB, he brought up the last line of "The Blacker The Berry" and Kendrick said his lyrics are from his experiences, his real life. I been through a lot, I seen a lot, where I come from, Ive done a lot to tear down my own community, he said. I wanted Rob to dig deeper. What, exactly, had he done to tear down his community? Kendricks face shows theres something hes keeping below the surface. As soon as you even allow yourself to ponder the idea, to consider even the hypothetical scenario that Kendrick has truly murdered another man, your brain starts to shut down. Its like if Batman killed the Joker, no one would believe it. That goes against his moral code, no matter what the crime or criminal, theres a line he wouldnt cross. Or, maybe more accurately, a line we think he wouldn't cross, as if we really know his life, as if we really know Kendrick Lamar Duckworth. 
 
 If these were Bobby Shmurda lyrics there would be no doubt. They would match his image, a young man that turned his reckless lifestyle into rap music. When Bobby said Mitch caught a body a week ago it was more than a catchy lyric, we all believed him. The police believed him. Yet, Kendrick says he killed a man, and we mask it as metaphorical. Assume its conceptual, that hes speaking from another perspective. And it very well may be...but what if he's not? Just allow yourself to think if for a moment. Kendrick has also insisted that the stories he tells are real ones, although not always his story. But what if he really did shoot someone? What if gangbanging really did make him kill someone? Even if he confessed the entire story, would you believe him? 
 
 On "Sherane," Kendricks mom tells him, If he keeps fuckin around in the streets, he wont make it to the next grade, 11th grade. Between 10th and 11th grade you're likely 15 or 16 years old. This time period seems to hold great significance. This is when hes breaking into homes, smoking weed and roaming the streets in his mommas van. He's been in circles that were causing mayhem in the streets, at the age of nine he was hanging with a crew of kids packing vans with guns and seeing someone get their brain evicted from the skull. Not saying he was active, but Kendrick is able to document the mad city because he was in the heart of it. Flags didnt hang from his back pocket, but his affiliation with friends likely threw him into dangerous situations and scenarios. One unlucky night was around each corner, grandma staying in the wrong neighborhood could lead to guns drawn and bullets soaring. Kendrick went from being a product of his surroundings to escaping through music. Something triggered this mentality change, what if the change was brought because he killed someone? Imagine if the ending of GKMC is fictional, instead its like Boyz In the Hood except Tre doesnt get out the car. You got a bunch of boys, filled with rage, who just witnessed a friend die. I believe they got revenge before an old woman with holy water baptized them. 
 
 *And if this bottle could talk* (gulp) *I cry myself to sleep*

  *Bitch everything is your fault*
 
  *Faults breakin' to pieces, earthquakes on every weekend*
 
  *Because you shook as soon as you knew confinement was needed*
 
  *I know your secrets*
 
  *Don't let me tell them to the world about that shit you thinkin'*
 
 "U" is Kendrick at his most personal. Its chilling how he was able to convey such emotion. The song highlights his faults, moments where he let himself down. Failing as a role model, failing as a brother, failing as a friend, confessing his suicidal thoughts, it all pours out of him like punctured blood vessels. That last verse it seems like hes about to make a confession, but instead decides to chug from the bottle. An incident that shook him to the core, an altercation that couldve lead to confinement. He carries an immense amount of survivors guilt, its apparent on a good portion of TPAB, but it feels like hes haunted by more than just escaping. Through music hes seeking redemption for the all the wrongdoings in his past. By becoming a beckon of light, he stops the cycle that stole his friends, enemies and his innocence.
 
  *"Yesterday I invaded privacy of a home*
 
  *The day before that my partner had fronted me a zone*
 
  *A week before I had loaded bullets inside that chrome*
 
  *Two weeks before that I shot them bullets and he was gone*
 
  *A month before that I cursed my mother then slammed the door*
 
  *Six months before that I hit my woman, she hit the floor*
 
  *I stormed out then seen a black Honda Accord*
 
  *Them hollow tips missed me then hit that little boy"*
 
 Theres a song called His Pain on BJ The Chicago Kids mixtape, Pineapple Now   Laters, that I always felt shouldve been placed on Section80. The title is fitting and Kendrick completely dominates the song with a grief stricken performance. He raps three verses before BJ even appears on the song. The hook is Kendrick repeating, I don't know why He keep blessing me, while illustrating the cold world that hes currently trapped in. The second verse, he talks about home invasions, murder and domestic violence. Hes talking loading bullets and blasting, being shot at, surviving but a stray bullet hitting a bystander. We can assume this is incredible creative writing, or incredibly candid storytelling. In the third verse he says, I analyzed on how a saint can play the villain, self-reflecting on who he is, and who he is becoming right before having a revelation. He believes God blessed him so he can bless us. Thats the Kendrick Lamar mission. To redeem himself by using his life to redeem others. 
 
 This is the theory that my buddy Kelechi and his brother Ukandu brought to my attention in a group text. I was in denial when they first shared the evidence, claimed it all as reaching, but its hard not to at least seriously consider once all the dots connect. The text thread is literally full of countless oh shit, fuck and you have to write this. It feels dirty to even think. Kendrick is hip-hops golden child. We finally had a rapper that wasnt just about money, bitches and violence, his thoughts are bigger than the clichs, and I would hate to taint his image with mistakes made during adolescence. I respect the fact that he puts it out there, like an Easter egg for listeners to find. Something happened during Kendricks 16th year, possibly an accident, maybe self-defense, but it changed him forever.
 
 I know friends that come from good homes, great parents and still get tangled up with the wrong crowds. The kind of guys that never break into homes but stand outside as lookouts. They wouldnt rob a bank, but they have been a part of check fraud. This is how I always imagined Kendrick, flirting with danger, but never gave into the temptation. If he held a pistol, it was unloaded. He got fired from his job after being pressured to stage a robbery. This isn't the kind of guy that is expected to be a kingpin of crime. I figured he spoke as a witness, he rapped from the perspective of an observer. Thats the person I connected with, who I rooted for. He symbolized overcoming a life in a rough environment. The thing about being a rap fan, the lyrics are sacred. We spend time dissecting and separating the real, phony, and exaggerations. His stories were real, but when he touched on subjects that seemed out of character, I dismissed them as just that - Kendrick channeling a character. Now, things have changed a bit. The information isn't new, it's always been there, I'm just now seeing the puzzle with all the pieces. 
 
 Now this is not an article saying that Kendrick did it; as much as the police are increasingly trying to blur the lines, as much as rappers try to blur the lines, song lyrics are art, not confession. But ever since the day I first started thinking about this article, I was lookin at him different.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> He got the Iron Spider gear in The Amazing Spider-Man months beforehand and he's barely in the main book itself and his role is really inconsequential. Anything notable that happened to him in that arc was retconned out a year later.

	<TEXT> I didn't realise how good DC have been about this. Probably because the Justice League in the comics is mostly white. Not sure whether Ezra Miller would identify himself as a person of colour though and Green Lantern and Shazam are yet to be cast.

Edit: It could still be less of a sausage fest though. Maybe a female Green Lantern to make up for the years of fridging  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It seems like your comparing a single issue of a comic to an entire series or novel, which I'd disagree with. A 22 page comic is going to have limitations, but when six issues come together to form a trade,  then this would be more apt as they have just as much room to develop characters and stories. If "limited dialogue" is just something you've experienced in comics, I'd point you towards something wordier. Some comics average a hundred words a page where others average ten. I also feel characterisation can be conveyed through emotions and reactions which illustrations deliver with ease. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Nope. The only advantage that TV has is length and novels' prose. Prose can easily be replicated by comics though and comics have the ability to display things happening at different times simultaneously and have many other tricks that give them an advantage (not to mention budget). Google Scott McCloud's Understanding Comics. A great read that really gives more insight into art in general. </TEXT>
