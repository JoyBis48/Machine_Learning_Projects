	<TEXT> So while I'm not exactly _new_ to the Fandom, an new to actively participating. I'm wondering about Conventions.  I'm aware of the annual Confuzzled that takes place in the UK, but are there any more?

I'm a bit of a convention nut and I've been to a few other fandom cons/general geeky cons.. but every other con I hear of is in the USA and I don't think I could head over there for a weekend, as much as I'd love to.

I think I'll skip on Confuzzled this year due to trying to work out my financial situation, but I'm pretty much open next year!

(Of course, I'm going to Download Festival this year, as well as _maybe_ attending BUCK in Manchester too, and then there's the obvious MCM Expo that turns up once or twice yearly.) </TEXT>

Congrats! I know a few Trans people, and they're looking forward to the OK on the HRT.

I've had a few "Eh?" and "Seriously? Isn't that the self reproduction thing?" and my sister said "Oh, so you're just not into relationships at all then?"

But nothing hostile, and when I went to a Brony meet a few months ago and the topic of sexualities came up in the post-meet-pissup, the fellow I was talking to was quite.. excited to meet an Asexual person, as he'd never met any before! Which was quite refreshing </TEXT>

Maybe I just wasn't into women, I thought. Was I gay without realising? A few more weeks passed. Nothing. I felt nothing for anyone.. 

But then I met my girlfriend, fell for her after a few months of knowing her as a good friend. We lasted a year before the distance killed it, but all the time - even when we met - I never once thought "I want to do the horizontal dance right now".. I was quite content to just sit on the sofa with her, cuddle, kiss and watch TV.

Cut to last year, I'm lurking on the BBC news site, and I see Jenni and Tim's article. "Hey, that sounds a bit like me.." </TEXT>

In 1651 the Earl of Derby was executed for his part in the Bolton Massacre outside the Man and Scythe

Also, another fun fact: I live 2 minutes down th' road from The "Phoenix Club", which I promptly clip people around th' lug'oles, and say "It's the St Gregory's club, you prick."

I spent 5 hours playing that game.. Every time I died, the resurrection animation took at least 2 minutes. When you're getting pissed off with a boss and that god damned fucking angel comes from the sky to grab you, then drop you off a 5 minute run away, you get frustrated every time that bitch comes down from the sky

Otherwise, I thought it was quite fun, I just couldn't stand the delay of getting knocked out of the fight, before being able to take control of your character again. </TEXT>

Went from Fox, to Dragon, to a different dragon, to another different dragon, back to the first dragon, and now I'm a Lynx. Give it a few years and I'll probably be a Dragon again or something.

	<TEXT> The worst I personally encountered was on a friend's stag-do

We booked the field with an events company who run open days there. We had about 30 people with us, so we had the place to ourselves - it's a woodland.

Anyway, we're playing, and everyone's having a laugh, but repeatedly, we'd been telling one of the guys to "Take your damn hits" - At one point, I was stood next to the guy and I could hear the bbs bouncing off his gear.

I'd had it - but the Stag's brother got to him before I did. He snuck up closer and closer, peppering him on full auto with a G36.

He only shouted "Hit!" after a solid minute of being peppered. He was wearing goggles - his face had a few cuts.

He was being a dick through the entire day. Not taking hits, aiming for the head and generally not giving a shit for his or anyone else's safety. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You get laughed at? Damn.. Whenever I tell people, I just get "Huh, interesting. Well, whatever."

I have had the odd giggle, but what can they do about it? 

To be fair though, I stopped caring years ago. I have ponies sat on top of my monitor, I have the asexual flag on the back of my car. I am what I am and I ain't changing for no-one, nor am I hiding it.

It's hard to "Let go", but it's probably the best thing I did. Heck, if you don't make a big deal of it, no-one cares. If the topic comes up, mention it. People are more likely to take it in stride and roll with it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There's one game I've conjured up so far for my fictional race, the Feln: Coinsies

Based on an old schoolyard game I used to play back when I went to school.

**Coinsies**

A target is drawn on the floor, close to a wall. This game can be played with as many people as you like, as long as you can find your coin amongst the mess!

Competitors take turns flicking a coin at the wall, trying to get it to land in the centre of the target by bouncing it off the wall. Best of 3 wins the round, and a game normally lasts for 5 rounds

Its origins were back in the Lon empire, in the early 2100 years.. It's very much hard to play is the present day, mostly due to coins being taken out of circulation and digital currency being used globally. People still hold onto old coins, or make their own - just to play the game.
