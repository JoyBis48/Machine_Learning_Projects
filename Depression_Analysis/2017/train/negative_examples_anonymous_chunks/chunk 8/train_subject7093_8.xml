	<TEXT> Beautiful, but he's wrong.   Everyone here has seen chaos mode used before in their lifetime.  Chaos setting is used when someone breaks into your house and you need to make a quick escape.  Movies will show someone grabbing 3 or 4 flammable aerosol cans and placing them in the microwave.   Next will hit the chaos button before fleeing the house.    What happens next is always chaotic from explosions and fires taking out your enemies.     </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I always check eBay auctions.   I'll watch a couple to see if there's a consistency on bids/$.  I will also x-shop amazon and other online retailers.    Pretty easy to figure out a fair yet reasonable price.   

Edit:   Also as for selling in a lot of games or as singles it all depends.   Have a bunch of low title name games (sports games, repeats, ect) sell as a bundle.  
Have big ranking titles like (Final Fantasy III, Chrono Trigger, Mario RPG).   Sell separate.   Have sequel or trilogy titles?   Sell as a set. (Donkey Kong. DK 2, DK3) 

If you go eBay route, combine shipping with different auctions.    This will help your buyers and have them battle for certain games since they are committed on the shipping.   </TEXT>
