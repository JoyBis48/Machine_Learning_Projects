	<TEXT> I got to play the 3rd one thru night 5 with no information.  That was special.

However I will never forget the first time I played FNAF 1.  I had heard about it online but wanted to give it a shot.  I got my siblings and cousins together, who had never heard of it, and sat them in the basement watching me on the iPad.  We all screamed and jumped when Bonny showed up at the door for the first time.  

Over the next few days we took turns playing to see if we could make it through to night 5.  I think we got to 4.

Anyway play it with friends, makes it more fun and less scary!  Also you can turn the sound down when you don't want the jumpscares to be so intense. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The eyes are so wierd, how does Chica have narrower eyes in some pictures and wider eyes in others?  The eyeball isn't being covered up, it seems to be changing size itself.

Anyway some more things to look into:

- flashing Freddy eyes (morse code/binary?)

- Animatronic glitch timing (morse code/binary?)

- the static between games

- Weird static/distortion that follows you when you turn your head in the office - watch the pixels on the desk

Keep up the good work </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Wrote a final paper on Frankenstein and FNAF. Got an 86% </TITLE>

I'm a junior (third year) at college and I wrote my analysis paper on Five Nights at Freddy's.  My teacher said she never had a student include a video game as a source before but for some reason she let me do it.

If you're going to read it I have to add that the college is a private Christian school so naturally there's several biblical allusions.  Also, it's not perfect and there are some mistakes.

Here's a link: http://www.docdroid.net/10rk1/fnaf-paper.pdf.html

Student Readers Summary:  In the original order, man is above all creation but falls short of divinity.  Frankenstein portrays a terrifying farce in which this order is disrupted and man creates new life.  5.N.A.F. tells a similar story in which robots are animated via dead children.  Both stories horrify because even the most successful attempts at creating life fall terribly short, and offend the humanity of the audiences.  We are not the sources of life, and in fact need God to supply our own life.  

TL;DR:  Humans are incapable of creating anything greater than or equal to themselves, and any living thing created solely with human hands is doomed to be a monster. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I heard that the elevator cables can bunch up and slow your descent at the bottom.  Also a rapid descent can build up compressed air in the lower part of the shaft, further slowing the elevator.
