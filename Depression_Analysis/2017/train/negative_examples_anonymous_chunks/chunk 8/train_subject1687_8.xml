	<TEXT> True, cable news might not be the best educational place of learning for anyone, but banning it *would* stop some people from learning about the news. That, and your proposal would probably extend past Fox News, right? I'd imagine you'd have some sort of agency set aside to censor the Internet and media, like China with their Great Firewall. So there'd be a lot more than just shutting off Fox News going on, I'd imagine, which could cause a severe lack to information.

The other issue is you'd be forcing hate speech to underground, where it can't be responded to. I'd rather stand before the KKK in public to counter protest, than force them to meet in hiding where they might become more radicalized (not to say they can't do that now, but banning them from public forms of speech would only increase secret meetings). Plus, I couldn't identify public bigots as easily, and people couldn't respond to their presence or actions.

 slavery was well known to be wretched

Depending on the time you around. During the 17th century, very few white Americans were against slavery. Most thought the practice was fine and used the Bible to support the institution. Now of course there's a very important thing to remember here: acts of violence aren't speech. Every decent society bans acts of violence because they tangibly proeduce harm to another, whereas speech does no such thing.

If you think that calling blacks equal to whites is racist towards whites, then you're truly misunderstanding human decency

*I* don't think that, but if I was born two hundred years ago as a white man, I probably would have, and so would you if you were born into the same circumstances. It's hard to imagine, but about two hundred years ago a lot of white men and women were vocally racist and thought that white superiority was just the way things were meant to be. You and I don't agree with that because we were born in a different time, in a different context. What constitutes as "human rights" and "racism" is subject to change. Heck, black Americans were't even considered people until the 3/5ths Compromise (and even then they weren't considered a whole person). 

The other reason you and I believe what we do about equality is because speech was allowed to flourish, and wasn't banned by the government. Again, both of us as 19th century white people probably would have been against the notion of total equality for the races (even plenty of abolitionists were against the notion, which you can see in *Bound For Canaan* by Fergus Bordewich). We believe what we believe because people were allowed to speak their minds, even though their thoughts would be considered "ignorant" for their time.

	<TEXT> That's contradictory, isn't it? You can't proclaim to be against coddling the ignorant and then turn around and propose ideas which them go ahead and foster ignorance (the lack of knowledge). Banning certain types of speech makes people *more* ignorant, not less. So are you against ignorance, or for it? 

 The example of proclaiming women as equal to men is not an indecent thing, it is not lynching of black men; it is not letting poor people starve; it is not stealing form the poor to give to the rich; it is not allowing bankruptcy and death if you can not afford health care.


Right, but my point is opinions change, which is why censorship is bad. If you tried proclaiming black men were the equal counter parts of whites in the 19th century, most folks would call your opinion ignorant, racist (against the white man), and just plain *crazy*. Under the conditions you're against (racism, ignorance, hatred), such vocal opinions probably would have been banned because it was a different context of thought, and your thoughts would be dangerous and evil. 

Sure, you might say of course that opinion isn't evil or wrong, but you can only say that in hindsight two hundred years later. What's not indecent to you now probably would have been wretched to you a century or two ago. 
 
I recommend *Unlearning Liberty* be Greg Lukianoff for some great thoughts on banning speech.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Do folks *not* have the right to an opinion? If that's the case, that sounds like a desire for blatant censorship, which is one way to encourage ignorance in the masses. Plus, what constitutes as insane changes from time to time. If you proclaimed that woman were just as equal as men nearly a century ago, your opinion would have been considered far out there, and you may have been considered crazy.

	<TEXT> It's happening everywhere. If you look at the data, to understand Thomas Jefferson's inaugural address you'd need about a college level education. To understand Obama's? About a 5th grade level. 

And when you look at the State of the Union addresses, for every minute of speech there's about a thirty seconds worth of applause. 

In other words, nothing of value is being said any more.

	<TEXT> 21 year old Bostonian living in Utah, currently working for the Red Cross. 

For my historiography class, I chose to do research on Nixon's visit to China after watching an opera on TV called "Nixon In China". Since then, I've been fascinated by Sino-US relations, and beyond that, everything China does in the game of international politics. 

On a side note, one of the coolest things I ever got to see was the China exhibit at the Richard Nixon Presidential Library in California. There were a lot of cool things on display there.  </TEXT>
