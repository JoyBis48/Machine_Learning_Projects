	<TEXT> [this story here](http://comicbook.com/2015/04/16/jj-abrams-buys-pizza-for-everyone-waiting-in-line-at-star-wars-c/) should shed some light on the subject. of course some of you may say, this is a publicity stunt, or hes bribing the fans , or other bullshit heartless things like that. what would YOU DO if a famous hollwood director bought YOU food? huh? of course the movie doesnt even come out for another 8 months, i shouldnt even be having this discussion, yet. just remember this story when you walk out of episode 7 (when it comes out of course) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> i predict i will accept it equally with episodes 1-6 and meanwhile there will be people online or on blogs putting a puss on, bitching about how its in league with the prequel trilogy, and how jj abrams is a bad director, and ruined star trek and other such bullshit.But at this point its no use getting upset or acting surprised. there will be people disliking a star wars regardless of what trilogy its part of. i for one enjoy all o them. i dont know how to end this so ill just leave it at that </TEXT>

	<TEXT> like that kree that recently came to earth with the amnesia thing,(whos name i dont remember), couldve brought like a video document of some kind showing that battle on nova prime, and coulson would be like, "was that a raccoon? and a tree creature?" you get the idea, the reasdon why i bring this up is because theres not really a whole lot connecting GOTG with the avengers and sheild, beyond a few references to other mcu movies and thanos, and thats pretty much it. the point im getting to is the GOTG  so far just EXIST, but imo there needs to be some mention on aos or something to make a good strong connection </TEXT>

Alien says "because, we want to" then he gets them said raccoon and the aliens leave

The actual scene: we go back to the aliens in their ship and there's a mini montage of hacking and slicing stitching etc... But then the raccoon awakes and the aliens look over it all amazed and shit, and we cut to the raccoon and its revealed to be rocket from GOTG, and then rocket reacts "oh why do I feel different, and why am I speaking?"

	<TEXT> i came to the conclusion that daniel craig haters are sociopaths, i enjo them but whenever someone critisises them they gather in a group, making me feel like an outcast. and worse yet theres a user on imdb that copies and pastes the same criticism over and over again, i want him to die, and he goes by acdc-1989 hes probably the leader of the daniel craig haters, hes probably having a rally as we speak, and theyre probably burning a daniel craig dummy on a string and poking it with spears. and theyre probably planning on burning down dvd sections in all targets, walmarts, kmarts, etc. and get this, Bump, is their slogan probably, because acdc-1989 starts a topic and just says bump the other self posts. all im saying is as soon as you find out someones a daniel craig hater. stop being friends with them immediately, theyre evil and heartless, thank you, if theres a valid reason why i shouldnt like the daniel craig james bond movies please state why please </TEXT>

this is the video where it started it all, now im searching for reboot haters and teaching them a lesson ever since, now you see why i hate people who dislike the reboots, its because theyre ASSHOLES!! and theyre trying to ruin jj abrams career, by doing this so i ask for all haters to stop being haters!!!! i want all criticisms to stop!!!! thank you, not any one of you will amke me not like the reboots i know your game!! you want jj abrams to suffer and bob orci and jurtzman to suffer, well i wont have it!! thats how careers get ruined. dont you see? btw i enjoyed into darkness, and no one i repeat NO ONE will try to convince me otherwise, you may be thinking "but people have different opinions" Adolf hitler had an OPINION, kkk members have an OPINION, terrorists have OPINIONS. People have been telling me that for years and it's brought me nothing but misery, so I'm warning you Star Trek reboot haters, I'm on to you, someday I'll catch you all having a rally burning a jj Abrams dummy on a string and poking it with spears, and lynching a reboot fan, LIKE ME!! So don't be surprised if I report you to a hate crime division </TEXT>

I mean you may be saying "why are you wasting your breath saying some few people didn't like a movie?" Well before you respond to that, is it true that:

a) reboot haters are sociopaths

b)burn jj Abrams effigies kinda like the KKK 

c) lynch reboot fans also like the kkk from a speeding car

d) there's a conspiracy to destroy anyone and anything involved with the reboots?

e) reboot haters are conspiring to hack paramount 

Are any of these true? Why or why not

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe

i mean wtf man!? however the mcu wiki is up to date

http://marvelcinematicuniverse.wikia.com/wiki/Phase_Three

i mean what gives who do i believe? AND to add insult to injury check out this paragraph from the list of mcu films from wikipedia:

In December 2014, emails between Sony Pictures Entertainment Co-Chairman Amy Pascal and president Doug Belgrad were released after the November hacking of Sony's computers, stating that Sony wanted Marvel to produce a new trilogy of Spider-Man movies while Sony retains "creative control, marketing and distribution". Marvel also wanted to include Spider-Man in Captain America: Civil War. However, discussions between Sony and Marvel broke down, with Sony wanting to go ahead with its already planned slate of Spider-Man films.[284]

i mean wtf!? who do i believe? the moderator for that page is probably sipping some scotch on the rocks being entertained for his not up to date page </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 1. how will they have the daily bugle, if at all? because i dont recall any mention of the daily bugle in any previous mcu media, they'll need to introduce the daily bugle at some point, or at the very least show an adult peter parker looking back on his life, and in a flashback show a young peter parker working there and then in present day say it closed down, or something

2. if they have j. jonah jameson, how strong  will his dislike for spider man be? because if there's other superheroes he'd be totally fine with it.
"i really hate spiderman!" "but sir we report on the avengers all the time, and you seem totally fine with them.'' "oh yeah, alright then no harm done.''

see what i mean? </TEXT>
