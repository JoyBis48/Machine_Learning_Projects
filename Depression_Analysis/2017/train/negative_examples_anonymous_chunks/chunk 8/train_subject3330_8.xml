	<TEXT> Absolutely terrible line up... But this is for the "campaign" that uses the preset live recordings of the crowd etc.

The saving grace of this GH is going to be GH-TV. Using music videos from the songs and is constantly updated with new music all the time, it's also apparently launching with 100s of songs...

So yeah the campaign line up sucks... I'll reserve judgment till they release a track list of whats available on GH-TV and what they have planned down the line. </TEXT>

 SingleTrac began simultaneously developing the two projects, codenamed "Red Mercury" (Warhawk) and "Firestorm" (Twisted Metal). The two actually began as a single game with a common code base.[22] During the testing phase, the player would be able to fly the Warhawk ship around the first arena of Twisted Metal and fire weapons at the cars below

Being a games developer, as you are, do you any input on my above comment past "You dont know about how they handle their finances"

Do you think I am wrong or have a misguided view on how easy it would be to apply a language patch the original PSP game?

In your experience how long would something like that take? how many staff? Would there be any licencing hurdles they'd have to jump over to get the game out on another platform? HOw long would the certification process take before distribution was feasible? Would the cost of these things outweigh the potential profit?

Or you could just give another witty retort. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi. I specifically said Type 0 PSP, nothing about the HD version.

They do not need to port anything, the PSP version is there, complete, ready to go, albeit in Japanese. The fan base did their own translation and patched in themselves. 

Square Enix can release it to the west as is, if they wanted Or they could apply an official english patch (Which would be easier now since they have the entire game translated thanks to the HD release) With little work. I'm not saying no work, I'm saying negligible work for a company that size.

Once more for reading comprehension sake, I said Type 0 PSP. Not Type 0 HD. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Look all I'll say is you are not the target demographic for those films and thats fine.

The number of quality movies made on lower budgets with little to no special effects far surpass the Hollywood dribble you obviously take issue with. 

As with everything in life if you rely purely on face value / advertising you will get the most superficial crap around. That's where you're at now.

So, go do some research yourself, take a risk and watch some international films, they are plentiful and you'll find quality thought invoking films from the world over.

Or you can sit on the internet and complain how you only see "geek culture" permeating theaters... Either way I dont care, I know there are thousands of films made each year catering to all audiences. You too can take advantage of that or just take whats thrown in your face by Hollywood advertising. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Bullshit, pure and simple.

You may see superhero movies advertised more this is a given with their larger advertising budgets, this does not mean there has been a decline in the quality or number of serious / drama movies in theaters at all.

Hell, jump onto IMBD and looking at the number of Drama movies released in 2014 / 2015 and then compare that list to superhero / action movies.


In fact, here are a couple of highly rated drama movies I've pulled from my ass on a whim:


*  The Water Diviner  
*  The Longest Ride  
*  Child 44 
*  The Imitation Game  
*  Unbroken 
*  Gone Girl  
*  Whiplash  
*  Woman in Gold  
*  Birdman: Or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance) 
*  Inherent Vice 
*  The Theory of Everything 
*  Fury 
*  Wild  
*  The Wolf of Wall Street 
*  Cake 
*  The Grand Budapest Hotel 
*  Still Alice  
*  Boyhood 
*  Foxcatcher 

And here are the super hero movies from 2014 / 2015:

* Captain America: The Winter Soldier
* The Amazing Spider-Man 2
* X-Men: Days of Future Past
* Guardians of the Galaxy
* Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
* Avengers: Age of Ultron
* Ant-Man - NOT RELEASED
* Fantastic Four - NOT RELEASED.

Thats it, now that hardly seems like a flooded market no does it.


So again, advertising makes the difference here. And seeing as you are not the target demographic for superhero movies of course it seems like all there is available at the theater is those movies. 

but yeah again, you are wrong. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey Melbourne people! 

I doubt anyone will see this but it's worth a try.

I've been toying with the idea of organizing a "pop up cinema" around Melbourne. I'd like to organize a monthly or bi monthly event at different locations around Melbourne doing screenings of classic, new, cult, indie, B grade/bad films and of course Aussie/local films. 

I'd love to do themed nights (Bad movie night etc.) and have people get involved by voting for what movies they'd want to see, the next theme, preferred location. 

I already have most of the equipment required, other than venues and licencing...

I've briefly looked into the licencing, permits etc that would be required but haven't given it too much thought as I'm not sure if I could garner enough interest / enough of a following to make it worthwhile.

TL;DR

I'd like to see if there would be any interest in a pop up cinema around Melbourne with themed events that caters to movie lovers? 

Ideas? Thoughts? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 1982: E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial Game.

Atari obtained the rights to make a game based on the ET movie, they paid one person to design and make the game, not only that, they only gave him about 5-6 weeks to do it in.

Their motivations were not to please the fans, or to create art, it was an opportunity to cash in on a popular franchise / brand recongition, it was an investment and they were looking for a quick turn around on that investment.

Nothing has changed since then, gaming has and always will be a business and as with all businesses the objective is profit, if you can make a good product, even better bu profit is the bottom line. Like it or not. </TEXT>

You would have to eat a LOT of bananas just to compete with the natural potassium dose of your body. But we're talking about genetically engineered Bananas here...

 So they'll all get cancer from eating too many genetically engineered Bananas... Or they themselves will mutate and turn into a giant banana like cocoon that when ripe peels back to reveal a delicious human/banana hybrid... because life, uh, finds a way. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thats nothing compared to BF: Hardline on the PS4 PSN...

$99 Standard edition - This is expensive for a glorified mod but ok, whatever.

$109 Deluxe Edition - Same as above, only they give you a few battlepacks, basically you are paying to to unlock in game content with real money... Which is stupid, but whatever, some people are ok with that I guess.

$179 Ultimate Edition - Thats right, they took a glorified mod of BF:4 by removing most of the weapons and vehicles, tacked on a shoddy story... Threw it into a "bundle" by "giving" you access to locked in game content through battlepacks or whatever they fuck they are called and then sell it at the low low price of $179... 

Think about that for a moment, that's almost $200 for a single game, that is verging on half the price of the hardware to play the game on. Not to mention it's a throwaway game that will be forgotten in a couple more months... 

Now we wait to see what they'll do with Starwars Battlefront and how many editions they'll throw down our throats with their DLCS and battlepacks and other cash grabs.

If this is the future of gaming then I'm out... Seriously... I'll stick to buying games one year or more after release when the "complete" edition comes out and is cheap. But again if they're multiplayer games then the community will be dead by that point as  they'll all have jumped ship onto the next big cash grab.

Shell 1: Touching shell one will activate a bidet like function.

Shell 2: Touching shell two will activate a fan/air dryer like function.

Shell 3: Touching shell three will flush the toilet.

	<TEXT> And now I know why they were saying the new GH was going to be a platform rather than a series of new games.

Removing graphics in the traditional sense, like the old games had and using live footage / music videos the game itself will never age.  Distributing the content/songs online... it will never run out of content.

Basically they've taken SingStar and thrown GH into the mix... Which is what GH should have been from the start.

If the starting price and content / songs are at a reasonable price point then I'm all in. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The answer to this is also in the article:
Occupational Segregation

What causes the discrepancy in workplace deaths? The main cause is occupational segregation  the tendency for some jobs to be mostly held by men, and others to be mostly held by women. The most hazardous jobs  whether due to exposure to dangerous substances, or to risk of falling or being in a highway accident  are disproportionately held by men. (Contrary to popular belief, people in risky jobs are not usually paid extra to compensate them for danger).

Occupation segregation, in turn, is caused in part by workplace discrimination, both in the form of employers preferring a particular sex, and in the form of on-the-job harassment and discrimination making blue-collar women, or a pink collar men, know that theyre unwelcome.

Occupational segregation is also caused by self-segregation, as many male workers feel uncomfortable applying for female-dominated jobs, and vice versa. There is, in my opinion, a vicious cycle functioning; the lack of pink-collar male, and blue-collar female, role models and mentors makes it less likely that future workers will cross the occupational gender line. </TEXT>

The other option is to set your "Real Name" as the ID you want to use and then show your "Real Name" instead of your PSN ID.

Edit: For instance, my PSN is DukeDuG... but I have my "Real Name" set as train_subject3330... For the same reason as you, I chose the PSN ID years ago and we cant change it... Being able to display and change your "Real Name" whenever you want helps. </TEXT>
