	<TEXT> Thanks for the info and pics, it's nice to see how they wore in and they look in good condition for 4 years in. That's definitely a huge plus for the Nike canvas if I can get them to last that long. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Versatile Gray Sneakers </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Okay, I'm looking for a pair of gray sneakers that will be versatile and be able to be paired with outfits for the spring/summer. I've narrowed it down to three pairs but would like an opinion which is best or if there are any other suggestions for versatile casual spring/summer sneakers. Here are the three I'm considering: [New Balance 574](http://www.amazon.com/New-Balance-Lifestyle-Sneaker-Silver/dp/B001AO20BW/ref=sr_1_1?s=shoes ie=UTF8 qid=1395191429 sr=1-1 keywords=new+balance+574) [Nike Canvas](http://www.amazon.com/Nike-CANVAS-SKATE-SHOES-MEDIUM/dp/B004W4T11Y/ref=sr_1_3?s=shoes ie=UTF8 qid=1395191503 sr=1-3 keywords=nike+canvas) [Adidas Campus II](http://www.amazon.com/adidas-Originals-Campus-Sneaker-Micinder/dp/B0021AF6QU/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8 qid=1395191544 sr=8-3 keywords=adidas+campus). Also, wondering if I can get any of them cheaper anywhere else. Thanks! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That really sucks, I wear a size 10 so the medium's max size is my size, but I like my socks to be tight, hopefully they get some in stock for you soon </TEXT>
