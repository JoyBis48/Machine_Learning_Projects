	<TEXT> it's my experience that people only get fired from a company when:

A) the company wants to fire you (IE: don't like you; looking for a reason)

B) when the company has outside pressure forcing them to fire you

If a company don't want to fire you, they'll at least punish you   keep you on.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> no, the moocher's are the minorities, right? you know, the ones who were: 

* denied decent education for decades
* denied equal wages   job opportunities
* had poor health due to costly healthcare   poor food options 
* have a high likelihood of turning to crime to make ends meet

but they choose to beg for handouts, right?

	<TEXT> the GOP are against birth control but don't consider how it'll lower many unwanted pregnancies. which can lead to: 

* lower cases of welfare (the GOP hates govt assistance unless it's for corporations)

* lower crime rates (they hate criminals but need a reason to justify their arsenal)

* lower education costs (they hate paying for education; educated people in general)

* lower medical costs (they hate poor people getting medical help)

*   less minorities (they especially hate minorities) 

leave it to the GOP to be counter-productive to their own agenda (again)

	<TEXT> if the MCC kept us in a room together after a match, we'd go straight into another match   therefore speed up the overall MP process for the user 

after a couple of games, we'd have a group of people determined to play   weed out the quitters who ruin the experience

I would be more likely to play for longer periods at a time (  have a better experience) if the MCC didn't kick me out to a lobby after every match. I worked hard to finally get in a lobby / game only to have to repeat that process after each match.  </TEXT>

For starters, there's no perishable goods (bread, produce/ vegetables, etc)   rest of their inventory is random.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Reagan   the war on drugs was a prohibition which bankrolled drug funded cartels to battle each other. This is the GOPs fault, yet they argue about people with common sense leaving their homes to make a living (  yes, they still argue about it while the past 3 years has been almost negative numbers). Think of all the US currency that left our economy only to fuel drug wars. 

Another example of the GOP being counter productive against their own interests... </TEXT>

sometimes the person who sells you food in togo makes $2.18/hr   are working for tips
