	<TEXT> Does patenting GMO organisms necessarily restrict free exchange of traits obtained through selective breeding?
  
Plant varieties derived from conventional selective breeding actually can be protected by the [Plant Variety Protection Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_Variety_Protection_Act_of_1970) which offers similar protections that patents do.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Dr. Perlak I first want to thank you for doing this AMA as I believe a lot of the concerns/fears of GMO is one rooted in a lack of dialogue between the public and the scientist behind this technology.
  
My first question is back in 1999 there was [this](http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB919722577962514000) article in the WSJ about how Monsanto has a buddy system in which they pair up a scientist with someone from marketing/finance. Amsuingly you are mentioned in the 1999 WSJ article. My question is, does the buddy system still exist at Monsanto, and what is/was your opinion on the system?
  
Second question/s are on behalf of /u/MennoniteDan who unfortunely can't post himself due to doing some actual farm work.
  
A)Can you explain the process of discovery, and implementation, of the genetics behind the new Xtend series soybeans?"

B)"What changes in formulation has Monsanto (and BASF) made to the dicamba in Roundup Xtend, in order to lessen the chance of volatilization? I farm near crops that are very sensitive to dicamba (cucumbers, peppers, peas, tobacco and ginseng) ."
  
Edit: One last question.
  
Do you think that the current regulatory environment and public opinion on genetic engineering has negatively impacted research into genetically engineered crops? And if so what do you believe would be a good way to address this issue?

	<TEXT> [Here is a very simple graph on suicides in India.](http://i.imgur.com/FovwdC0.png) 
  
  
[The largest comprehensive review on the data failed to find sufficient evidence that GMO bt-cotton was a major contributing factor to suicides of Indian farmers.](http://www.ifpri.org/publication/bt-cotton-and-farmer-suicides-india) 
  
We first show that there is no evidence in available data of a resurgence of farmer suicides in India in the last five years. Second, we find that Bt cotton technology has been very effective overall in India. However, the context in which Bt cotton was introduced has generated disappointing results in some particular districts and seasons. Third, our analysis clearly shows that Bt cotton is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for the occurrence of farmer suicides. In contrast, many other factors have likely played a prominent role. Nevertheless, in specific regions and years, where Bt cotton may have indirectly contributed to farmer indebtedness, leading to suicides, its failure was mainly the result of the context or environment in which it was planted.  


[Here is the 2011 Version](http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/routledg/jds/2011/00000047/00000002/art00007)
  

  
  
[And a more recent report.](http://www.geneticliteracyproject.org/2014/03/05/new-research-paper-gm-cotton-in-india-has-probably-reduced-farmer-suicides-not-caused-them/#.UxqR46hn8Uu)
 
The analysis reveals considerable variation in trends in suicide rates across the nine cotton-growing states. The data, although not ideal, and the modeling do not, however, support the claim that GM cotton has led to an increase in farmer suicide rates: if anything the reverse is true.
The Indian farmer suicide story has become received wisdom for some anti-GM
campaigners. In fact, we find that the suicide rate for male Indian farmers is slightly lower
than the non-farmer rate. And Indian suicide rates as a whole, although contested, do not
appear to be notably high in a world context. The pattern of changes in suicide rates over
the last 15 years is consistent with a beneficial effect of Bt cotton for India as a whole
albeit perhaps not in every cotton-growing state.

That's not really a fair comparison, you should look at similarly optioned cars. In the case of base models the 5 series is only 50k vs the 7 series 74k.
  
Most luxury cars that IIHS are in the 45-52k range with the sole exception being the new Maserati.

There was no evidence of a carcinogenic effect related toglyphosatetreatment. The lack of a plausible mechanism, along with published epidemiology studies, which fail to demonstrate clear, statistically significant, unbiased and non-confounded associations betweenglyphosateand cancer of any single etiology, and a compelling weight of evidence, support the conclusion thatglyphosatedoes not present concern with respect to carcinogenic potential in humans.

Note that there was a weak but slight association with multiple myeloma that the authors suggest that further follow up is required. Also this was among applicators who inherently are exposed to significantly higher amounts of glyphosate than end product consumers.

  
Also a re-analysis of the AHS data failed to show the same link between glyphosate and multiple meyloma.

To examine potential cancer risks in humans, we reviewed the epidemiologic literature to evaluate whether exposure to glyphosate is associated causally with cancer risk in humans. We also reviewed relevant methodological and biomonitoring studies of glyphosate. Seven cohort studies and fourteen case-control studies examined the association between glyphosate and one or more cancer outcomes. Our review found no consistent pattern of positive associations indicating a causal relationship between total cancer (in adults or children) or any site-specific cancer and exposure to glyphosate.

Just to clarify IARC's findings are not a risk assessment, they didn't look at the actual risk of getting cancer from glyphosate exposure. Their classification and findings are based off if they believe it can from the available evidence. A chemical could cause cancer in 1:1billion people or 1:10 people and they can be classified under the same group.
  
The German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment which conducted a risk assessment on behalf of the EU found glyphosate to be non-carcinogenic and they recently made a statement in [response to the IARCs finding.](http://www.bfr.bund.de/cm/349/does-glyphosate-cause-cancer.pdf)
  
The new IARC classification for glyphosate as a carcinogenic substance is based firstly on
limited evidence in humans. This risk is derived from three epidemiological studies in the
USA, Canada and Sweden based on a statistical correlation between exposure to glyphosate
and an increased risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. However, this assessment was not confirmed
in a very large cohort of the also cited "Agricultural Health Study" or in other studies. A
recent publication from 2012 has reviewed the epidemiologic literature to evaluate whether
exposure to glyphosate is associated causally with cancer risk in humans and the relevant
methodological and biomonitoring studies of glyphosate. The review found non-consistent
patterns of positive associations indicating a causal relationship between total cancer or any
site-specific cancer and exposure to glyphosate. The current report of BfR to the EU based
on the evaluation of over 30 epidemiological studies came to the overall assessment that
there is no validated or significant relationship between exposure to glyphosate and an increased
risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma or other types of cancer. 
  

  
[Evaluation of carcinogenic potential of the herbicide glyphosate, drawing on tumor incidence data from fourteen chronic/carcinogenicity rodent studies](http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.3109/10408444.2014.1003423)
  
There was no evidence of a carcinogenic effect related to glyphosate treatment. The lack of a plausible mechanism, along with published epidemiology studies, which fail to demonstrate clear, statistically significant, unbiased and non-confounded associations between glyphosate and cancer of any single etiology, and a compelling weight of evidence, support the conclusion that glyphosate does not present concern with respect to carcinogenic potential in humans.

When you look at human and animal studies the risk of glyphosate is overblown even among high risk groups such as applicators.
  

[Cancer Incidence among Glyphosate-Exposed Pesticide Applicators in the Agricultural Health Study](http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/3435746?uid=2 amp;uid=4 amp;sid=21104202186197)
  
Note that there was a weak but slight association with multiple myeloma that the authors suggest that further follow up is required. Also this was among applicators who inherently are exposed to significantly higher amounts of glyphosate than end product consumers.

  
Also a re-analysis of the AHS data failed to show the same link between glyphosate and multiple meyloma. 
  

[Multiple Myeloma and Glyphosate Use: A Re-Analysis of US Agricultural Health Study (AHS) Data](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25635915)
 
  
[Epidemiologic studies of glyphosate and cancer: A review](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0273230012000943)
  
To examine potential cancer risks in humans, we reviewed the epidemiologic literature to evaluate whether exposure to glyphosate is associated causally with cancer risk in humans. We also reviewed relevant methodological and biomonitoring studies of glyphosate. Seven cohort studies and fourteen case-control studies examined the association between glyphosate and one or more cancer outcomes. Our review found no consistent pattern of positive associations indicating a causal relationship between total cancer (in adults or children) or any site-specific cancer and exposure to glyphosate.
