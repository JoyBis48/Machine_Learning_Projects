	<TEXT> The best movie adaption is probably the Matthew Series or the Jesus Film.

Jesus Film (practically translated into every language possible) http://www.jesusfilm.org/

Visual Bible : Matthew

Personally, i thought Killing Jesus got the gist of the stories pretty accurately. Granted its not word for word but it also doesnt slide too much away from it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think all the business that are discriminating against Illinois and the media are to blame.
Personally, if any business that boycotted my state I would personally make sure that no money was going back to fund them. If you're going to interfere with the welfare of my citizens and provoke threats to influence something against our legalisation without any merit then you dont deserve to make any profits off of our state.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yea for a short time when she almost said Yes to getting married to me.

Initially she didnt want to marry me but then after sweet talking to her for a while I got her to a point where she would agree to marry me. But then it went all downhill because she got offended that I was asking her family about was she meant by her being "rebellious". She tried to explain it to me once and I was able to grasp some of what she was saying but I couldnt really hear her. 

What she meant by being rebellious is that "she has to do the right thing regardless of the consequences" which honestly didnt matter but the attitude that took place in her explaining it to me just put me off. not to mention she avoided talking to me for a while.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Me [28 M] with an arranged meet [27 F], getting aggravated </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-03-27 20:07:46 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I was in India a while ago for getting hitched for an arranged marriage. My parents introduced me to a girl and I just felt very confused and aggravated with her at the time because I really feared her attitude towards me. I felt disrespected.

So the reason for my post isnt to rant but to figure out few things.

a) I felt that I felt like my man card was being taken away from me because she was putting me down, controlling and had a rude tone.
b) She would misunderstand alot of things I said. 

1) How do I stop getting offended by being told off by a woman? She was def. smarter than me so I felt offended.
2) She said she was rebellious and that just made me fear for alot of conflicts down the road. Was I wrong about this?




   
**tl;dr**: Potential mate was disrespecting me. How should I have handled it? </TEXT>

Its free counseling.

I cant even imagine being in your boat. But I'm glad that you're willing to fight this! 

I could be wrong but you need someone who can love you unconditionally. A good friend or partner. I hope you find someone soon.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Take the job and get a Masters part-time while your company pays for it.
Masters in Comp Sci for the most part is just a regurgitation of your Bachelors degree except this time its more in-depth and you have to read/write more research papers. It def. boosts your salary but honestly current companies want experience over degree.
Enterprise companies will boost your salary for a grad degree but you will notice that you are significantly behind your peers in programming language acumen because you were focused on research and crap.

Oh and one last tip. Focus on being a well-rounded programmer. Dont focus on the money. I chose money and now I'm in a tough situation right now on moving forward in my career. Nothing too crazy but wish I had been a well rounded programmer rather than dedicated maintaining some custom-built project that gave me skills that i cant easily transfer to other companies.

tl;dr : Get a job. Have them pay for your Masters part-time.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Totally agree. 
Homework believe it or not is going to be the best thing to help you do the best down the road. And you can make lots of mistakes in high school and it wont matter. But that wont fly in college when you have a short timeframe and are under pressure from a bunch of equal weigted classes. 

In a nutshell study and do those homework problems.  </TEXT>
