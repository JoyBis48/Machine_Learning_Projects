	<TEXT> Here's the thing, though, as my psychologist wife would likely point out: the diagnosis is only part of the story.

Do I feel like I should be allowed to have a gun? Yes. I'm an intelligent, responsible, law-abiding citizen who respects his country, his fellow countrymen, and all reasonable laws. Anyone who knows me well would vouch for me and undoubtedly sign off on it saying, "Yes, I know this man; he can be trusted with a firearm."

Get ready for the twist: as a general rule, I would not want most people with borderline personality disorder to have a gun.

In fact, I feel that way strongly enough that I would give up my own right to a gun just to keep everyone else with borderline personality disorder from having one. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Plenty of them? Really?

Let's list white comic book superheroes then black superheroes and then note the insane difference. Then let's compare sales and notoriety.

Black superheroes: Black Panther, Storm, Spawn, Black Lightning, Green Lantern (John Stewart), Static, Mr. Terrific, Cyborg, Steel, Blade, Vixen, Icon   Rocket, Hardware, Bronze Tiger, Black Spider, Luke Cage, War Machine, Falcon, Bishop, Night Thrasher, Cloak, and a few others mainstream movie goers have never heard of.

White Superheroes: Almost every other superhero is white.

So Black Panther has a movie pending, Storm is only featured alongside the X-Men, Spawn had a movie, the only Green Lantern you can expect to see is Hal, Static had a cartoon but don't hold your breath for a movie, Mr. Terrific is relatively unknown and won't get a movie, people are already bitching about Cyborg's inclusion in the Justice League movie, Steel had a shitty movie and is just a Superman knockoff anyway, Blade had the trilogy that kicked off the comic book movie boom, Vixen is getting an animated series, Icon   Rocket are relative unknowns and won't get a movie but were featured in Young Justice, Hardware is unknown and won't get a movie, Bronze Tiger   Black Spider are borderline heroes but Bronze Tiger is in the CW Version of the Suicide Squad and both might be featured in a Suicide Squad movie sequel if the first one is successful, Luke Cage might appear in a Marvel TV series, War Machine has had multiple movie appearances but it's just the Iron Man knockoff, Falcon has appeared in a limited sidekick role, Bishop was briefly in an X-Men movie, Night Thrasher and Cloak may make appearances in a Marvel TV series. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Dismissing a person merely because they hold or lack a certain belief is bigotry. Look at what they do.

Context matters, and to all the people upvoting /u/CuntSmellersLLP (ah, Reddit), you might bother to look up the definition of the word "bigotry."

bigotry

bitr/

noun

noun: bigotry; plural noun: bigotries

***intolerance toward those who hold different opinions from oneself.***


So yeah, dismissing a person merely because they hold or lack a certain belief differently than you is, by virtue of definition, ***bigotry.***

If a man or a woman would make a great president but he or she legitimately believed in the Tooth Fairy, Easter Bunny, and Santa Claus, his or her actions ought to be judged by what he or she actually *does*, not but his or her absurd beliefs. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> there's a difference between having sexuality and appearing sexualized

Yes, there is; almost everyone on earth *has* sexuality, the only exception being people who claim to be asexual. We're talking about her having been sexualized from her earliest appearances in media which was in Batman: The Animated Series from which I have provided multiple examples, i.e., evidence. You're arguing against something I've already proved. 

Catwoman has always been portrayed as dripping sexuality, it's part of her personality. But Harley never was, that's just not true. 

Again, I've repeatedly shown that she has. The only difference is how much they were able to get away with on a prime time cartoon whose audience was mainly children. In the same way that they portrayed Catwoman and Poison Ivy on Batman: The Animated Series, they had to be suggestive and imply rather than being as overt as they can be in comics. 

You honestly can't see the difference between the page you linked from 1998, and the one in the OP?

There's nothing even implied by the Deviant Artists' work. There's nothing overtly sexual about it. Her outfit is a slightly more revealing version of her original costume. All it shows is her navel, some breast cleavage, and upper thighs. She's not posed provocatively, and she has a lipstick kiss on a Joker doll due to her well-established connection to the character. There's nothing overly sexual about it. Sexy, yes, but not sexual.

The picture I linked has a horny Harley wearing lingerie, mounting a desk, begging for sex by asking Mistah J to take a ride on *his* Harley while revving herself up.

So yeah, I *can* see the difference; OP's pic is tasteful and classy whereas the cartoon I linked was brazenly filthy. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They get away with more in the comics, but her sexuality was heavily implied in the cartoon and its comic book adaptation, not only with the Joker but an attraction to Batman and a highly hinted at lesbian relationship with Ivy which started on the cartoon and was recently confirmed. And when I say [heavily implied](http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11111/111114723/3468732-1330712478-funny.jpg)...

Harley Quinn has always been portrayed a super sexual. Same with Catwoman and Poison Ivy.   </TEXT>

RT critics: 78%

RT users: 76%

IMDb: 7.2/10

IMDb Arithmetic mean: 7.3.  

IMDb Median: 7

IMDb Mode: 7

IMDb Metascore: 69/100 

Metacritic: 69

User: 7.3

At a glance, one could logically conclude that, on a scale of 1-10, Brave is between a 6.9 and a 7.8, which would land it "good" territory.

Personally, I gave it a 6/10 on IMDb. It was horrible by any means; it just didn't do it for me.

	<TEXT> You still don't get it and this is the last I'll try and explain because at this point I'm just tired.

I come across a bunch of people complaining a specific McDonald's restaurant sells a low quality product low in nutritional value but high in sugars, fats, calories etc. I point out that not only is this specific McDonald's restaurant not unique, but that McDonald's restaurants in general are only part of a larger problem, i.e., fast food, junk food, how it's marketed, etc., etc., concurring that McDonald's definitely has problems, but so do all these other similar things.

Get it?

You don't have to keep telling me what the conversation is about. My point is that there's a larger issue, just like if there was a conversation about a specific line or paragraph or page in the Qur'an that is problematic, I'd mention that there are many more like it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This discussion is about The Quran, a holy book of a major world religion, specifically an Abrahamic one. Saying, "Calvin   Hobbs is hilarious" would have been a non sequitur. 

The point is that /u/kgt5003's comment that "a Muslim taking The Quran taken literally and living that way wouldn't be pretty" isn't unique to The Quran, indeed living literally by The Bible and/or The Torah would also mean horrifying things.

And what on earth is your point on making anything more valid? *What* is making *what* more valid? Did you actually think my comment intended to validate living literally by The Quran because doing so would be as good as living literally by The Bible?

Why am I even having to explain my comment to you? It wasn't complicated. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Bing Bong made the greatest sacrifice possible.

I was reading the official discussion thread over at /r/movies and some people were pointing out that Bing Bong was never mentioned again and some were expecting his memory to be brought up somewhere toward the end or even in a post-credits scene. 

I'm so glad they didn't.

Because as soon as you do that, there is no sacrifice. He's a figment of her imagination; he was never alive nor did he ever die. He was rattling around in her brain aimlessly and without purpose. It was in his sacrifice that he was able to make a real difference for the first time in a long time, and only greater sacrifice than giving your life for someone else's is to do so anonymously and not even be remembered for it. There was absolutely nothing in it for him at all. No fame, no glory, no memory. 

When he started helping Joy   Sadness, he was doing it because they said they could help her remember him. He was doing it for selfish reasons. His last act was the most unselfish thing he could ever do, knowingly sacrificing both his existence and any memory of him ever having existed.

Anything more would have cheapened it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Your arguments are from the perspective of a viewer of Man of Steel in our universe, not from the perspective of a Metropolis citizen in the Man of Steel universe.

All they know is aliens invaded their planet and threatened their world because Superman was there and they wanted to kill him. Then a fight breaks out and the result is like a dozen 9/11s. It was like living in Tokyo during a Godzilla fight. No one in Tokyo gives a shit if Godzilla was the "good guy" or "bad guy" in the fight; they care that their entire city was razed.

Then you'll have Lex Luthor helping to rebuild and using the distrust and fear, fueling it, adding speculation like, "What if Superman decided to take over the world? What if he decided to destroy it?"

People fear what they don't understand; Superman is beyond understanding; fear leads directly to hate. Yes, some people are going to see through all that and not blame him for the Kyptonian invasion and get that he didn't intentionally destroy half the city and was just trying to stop really horrible aliens from doing really horrible shit, and that's why there will be more than one position.

It's kind of political thriller when you think about it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You're absolutely right, and you're citing one of my favorite writers alongside one of my favorite Superman stories to make your point.

The thing with Man of Steel though is that it was the first installment in the DC Cinematic Universe and they had the future to think about. Barring a complete and total commercial flop, Man of Steel would be the foundation for each DCCU film to follow, and that includes setting a tone. Part of it was to set itself apart from Marvel, and the success of Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy was a clear message to the brass at Warner Bros. that the audiences liked their DC Comics movies darker, more serious, and with a more grounded approach, so they weren't about to fix something that wasn't broken. They could have gone lighter with Man of Steel, but then it probably would have done a shit job of setting up Batman V Superman, and more importantly, Justice League and its spin-offs. 

Unless Superman is fallible, thoughtful, philosophical, and grounded, he won't fit in when Batman shows up as his antithesis and they won't get to play with all the fun ideas of different philosophical approaches to seeking justice that the comics have played with over the decades. The trailer basically screams "Frank Miller's Dark Knight Returns The Movie," and they obviously want to explore some of those ideas. 

For people who really didn't like Man of Steel, hey, opinions are opinions, tastes are tastes, but I caution patience. They're going somewhere with this. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You argued my own point against yourself. Yes, every superhero has to resist the urge to act selfishly and deal with the consequences of power, but not like Superman because he's not a bright teenager bitten by a radioactive spider who can do whatever it is a spider does (like ESP, apparently). He's a god. He's is practically invincible, powerful beyond reason, and has a variety of powers at his disposal that are usually meted out one or two at a time for other heroes. Any normal person would justifiably have a god complex. 

If I were Superman--I won't even lie or sugarcoat it on the internet anonymously for strangers to read it--I would take over the world and shape it as I see fit. I'd be a benevolent overlord, but an overlord I would be, and the shitty thing is, I'm not some megalomaniac asshole; I'm a regular guy. I'd do what most people would do. 

Superman is interesting because he doesn't. He's above that. Injustice's who premise is pretty much, "What if something happened that made Superman do what any of us would do and impose his will on the world because he can?" </TEXT>

I like that the brands have separate and recognizably different approaches. I know when I see a Marvel movie it'll be a big, colorful, fun, smash-em-up explosion and punch festival with little jokes sprinkled in with paper thin plots. 

I know when I see a DC movie it'll be more grounded, realistic, darker in tone, and have actual meaning and consequences to think about. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  it was a rule invented for more kid friendly stuff

It's actually more to do with having recurring villains. For example, Batman has been published for over 75 years and across dozens of different monthly titles, limited series, one-shots, graphic novels, etc. If Batman killed his villains, the writers would have to keep coming up new ones all the time and we wouldn't have all these classic recurring characters.

What people fail to understand is that movies don't have this problem. The Joker is probably only going to appear once per franchise, so killing him doesn't matter. 

As for Man of Steel, the kill meant something. It seemed to be the only thing he could do at the time, and he'll face the consequences for it. It's going to be pivotal moment for him and he'll have decisions to make. Guys like Lex will get to make multiple appearances throughout the DC Cinematic Universe because Superman is going to have to think up better ways of handling his adversaries than execution or no one will trust him and he's too powerful a being to be both untrusted *and* left alone. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree with everything you wrote. "Man of Steel" was laying the groundwork for a franchise and had to establish a new Superman that was never the Christopher Reeves version nor ~~The Atom~~ Brandon Routh version nor the Lois   Clark version or the DCAU version. 

You hit the nail right on the head. This was Clark Kent becoming the Man of Steel. That ending that everyone complains about is him dealing with the consequence of his godlike power, the fallout from it, exploring the psychology of an outsider who wants to do good but isn't trusted because he's just too damned powerful. It's the most realistic take on Superman ever committed to film, so yeah, he's not going to be the bright eyed blue boy scout holding an American flag in one hand and an bald eagle perched on the other while telling kids to take their vitamins. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've done exactly that and can't hear any difference. This exact type of blind study has been done many times from many sources with similar result each time: most people can't tell the difference, many people who *can* tell the difference have about an equal chance of favoring either 128 or 320, or there's no preference.

The number of people who can hear the difference and consistently prefer the 320 to the point where they find the difference noteworthy and important, the so-called "audiophiles," are statistically low.

That being said, if you're an audiophile, obviously it's important to you, and it's good we have options like FLAC and sophisticated audio equipment.  </TEXT>

As for him being "The Man of Yesterday," this is the only instance of him ever being called that, and part of the point of Man of Steel was to bring Superman into modern times so he doesn't seem like a dated, corny relic with Ma and Pa, apple pies cooling on window sills, truth, justice, and the American way. It's intentionally modern and as grounded in reality as something as outrageous as Superman can be.

If you didn't like that, you've got plenty of company, but the style in which the movie was done was highly intentional/purposeful.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The Max Martin signature.

Listen to the bridge of the song, or failing that, listen to the next-to-last chorus or breakdown. You'll notice he has the artist repeat the chorus lyrically with a slightly different melody immediately afterward. Some examples include:

Backstreet Boys - [Shape Of My Heart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT5msu-dap8#t=157)

Backstreet Boys - [I Want It That Way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fndeDfaWCg#t=152)

Britney Spears - [Lucky](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vvBAONkYwI#t=181)

Britney Spears - [Stronger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJWtLf4-WWs#t=160)

Britney Spears - [You Drive Me Crazy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4VK9_CfOLQ#t=141)

Britney Spears - [Oops! I Did It Again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CduA0TULnow#t=188)

Nsync - [It's Gonna Be Me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQMlWwIXg3M#t=136)

Nsync - [Tearin' Up My Heart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZcmuKsyvzg#t=159)

He tried desperately to shake the habit in the late 2000s when his career had been slumping for a few years, so you'll be hard pressed to find it now, but back in the 1990s, it was a staple. Why was it so readily employed?

Bo Burnham - [Repeat Stuff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nt9c0UeYhFc)

Max's little trick enables the artist to repeat the chorus **yet again** while keeping the song fresh in the listener's mind, much akin to the way a "breakdown" does it by taking away elements of the backing track.

That's not really a great statistic. If this is the strongest self-defense case, it means they're just as likely to be used criminally as they are in self-defense. 

It's also worth noting that those self-defense occurrences are likely to be forced by having to deal with a gun-wielding threat to begin with, i.e., if bad guys didn't have guns, good guys would need guns with which to defend themselves. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I know the roundabout so well by now when it comes to these issues because this debate rages every single time a mass shooting happens, which is far too often in this country, and while I would like to see something done and I value human life far more than I do gun rights, I have yet to get a satisfactory answer to this one question: what do you do about the guns that are already out there?

[The United States has 88.8 guns per 100 Americans.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_of_guns_per_capita_by_country) That doesn't mean 88.8% of Americans are armed; rather that's how many guns there are in the United States that are owned by somebody. Let's say we went gun control crazy with waiting periods, mental health screenings, background checks, the works. Hell, let's say we banned the sale of any more guns at all making it 100% illegal to sell a firearm. [There are by various estimates anywhere from 270 million to 310 million guns in the United States.](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2013/06/04/a-minority-of-americans-own-guns-but-just-how-many-is-unclear/) What do you do about all those? 

The best suggestion I've heard is a buyback program, but that's voluntary and costly. 

What's the solution? Because until we deal with the reality that the United States has an out-of-control gun fetish, any further restrictions are like saying you can't add any more grains of sand to the beach. </TEXT>

[A Skeptical Science peer-reviewed survey](http://skepticalscience.com/97-percent-consensus-cook-et-al-2013.html) of all (over 12,000) peer-reviewed abstracts on the subject 'global climate change' and 'global warming' published between 1991 and 2011 ([Cook et al. 2013](http://iopscience.iop.org/1748-9326/8/2/024024/article)) found that over 97% of the papers taking a position on the subject agreed with the consensus position that humans are causing global warming.  In a second phase of the project, the scientist authors were emailed and rated over 2,000 of their own papers.  Once again, over 97% of the papers taking a position on the cause of global warming agreed that humans are causing it.

That's the original comment that started this thread. Then I said 

Pretty sure all of them aren't; 31 presidents served only in peace time.


Then /u/icarus-_-sky  said:

Our current president, and every president in the last 50 years has served during peace time. Name one 5-year span that the US has not been involved in a violent conflict in that time period. No declaration of war =! peace time.

To which you replied:

and even when not engaged in direct military conflict[1] (although its tough to find many periods there when America isn't fighting someone, most of which they started themselves), those presidents are still overseeing the CIA as it deliberately undermines Govts, destabilizes nations, and carries out its terrorist attacks around the world[2] .

Even when America isn't publicly at war, its pretty much guaranteed to be killing people somewhere

Staying on topic, you seemed to be justifying the original post which started this thread and that's what I'm responding to. My point isn't "moot;" my point is on topic.

	<TEXT> Amazing 1 was alright, so far as I'm concerned, but the biggest strike against it was that it was a reboot of a very recent franchise and tread a lot of familiar ground. I found it more of a dull ride than the original Spider-Man, and the original Spider-Man may not appeal as much to a younger generation who may not be able to appreciate how groundbreaking it was. 

As for ASM2, I can't understand anyone actually enjoying it aside from comedic value as in MST3K mockery of how silly/stupid it was. That being said, opinions vary, but it was the impetus of yet another Spider-Man reboot, so there's that.

I'll attempt to answer your question, Roth underscored the precarious existence of all peoples' lives in the Middle Ages:

"The modern reader frequently fails to realize that, generally speaking, life in the Middle Ages was not secure. For every section of the population the probabilities of meeting a violent death were high, even in times of comparative peace. Country people were continually subject to the onslaught of bandits or of lawless barons, as well as the marchings and counter marchings of armed forces.

     

[Even] city dwellers ... [ran] the risk of sack and wholesale murder. The whole of medieval, and a great part of modern, history is studded with instance of the sort: the devastation of Attila, the Scourge of God; the ravaging of the Vexin by William the Conqueror; the sack of a score of German cities during the Thirty Years War.

     

There were frequently cases when only a minority of the population survived, the vast majority being piteously massacred.


These events and their like should be borne in mind when one considers the vicissitudes of any particular racial or religious minority. The scarlet of Jewish persecution does not stand out on a ground of virginal white." [ROTH, p. 138]

That's not a thing. "Abject" is always negativeit is a modifier that means "hopeless," not "extreme." You can't have "abject good" unless you're being purposefully paradoxical, i.e., ironic. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Your point is taken and well made, but /u/djeijdowq is right so far as Jewish interpretation is concerned. The Talmud interprets the verses referring to "an eye for an eye" and similar expressions as mandating *monetary* compensation in tort cases and argues against the interpretations by Sadducees that the Bible verses refer to physical retaliation in kind, using the argument that such an interpretation would be inapplicable to blind or eyeless offenders. Since the Torah requires that penalties be universally applicable, the phrase cannot be interpreted in this manner. 

Since there is no form of punishment in the Torah that calls for the maiming of an offender, there is no case that could possibly be punished by the court injuring to his eye, tooth, hand, foot, etc.

The Talmud discusses the concept of justice as measure-for-measure retribution (middah k'neged middah) in the context of divinely implemented justice. Regarding reciprocal justice by court, however, the Torah states that punishments serve to remove dangerous elements from society ("and you shall eliminate the evil from your midst") and to deter potential criminals from violating the law ("And the rest shall hear and be daunted, and they shall no longer commit anything like this evil deed in your midst"). Additionally, reciprocal justice in tort cases serves to compensate the victim (see above).

The ideal of vengeance for the sake of assuaging the distress of the victim plays no role in the Torah's conception of court justice, as victims are cautioned against even hating or bearing a grudge against those who have harmed them. The Torah makes no distinction between whether the potential object of hatred or a grudge has been brought to justice, and all people are taught to love their fellow human beings.

	<TEXT> No. Despite some vague understanding of how diseases could spread, the existence of viruses and bacteria was unknown in medieval times, and the outbreak of disease could not be scientifically explained. Any sudden deterioration of health was often blamed on poisoning. Europe was hit by several waves of Black Death (often identified as bubonic plague) throughout the late Middle Ages. Crowded cities were especially hard hit by the disease, with death tolls as high as 50% of the population. In their distress, emotionally distraught survivors searched desperately for an explanation. The city-dwelling Jews of the Middle Ages, living in walled-up, segregated ghetto districts, aroused suspicion. An outbreak of plague thus became the trigger for Black Death persecutions, with hundreds of Jews burned at the stake, or rounded up in synagogues and private houses that were then set aflame. With the decline of plague in Europe, these accusations lessened, but the term "well-poisoning" remains a loaded one that continues to crop up even today among anti-Semites around the world.

Walter Laqueur writes in his book The Changing Face of Anti-Semitism: From Ancient Times to the Present Day:

There were no mass attacks against "Jewish poisoners" after the period of the Black Death, but the accusation became part and parcel of antisemitic dogma and language. It appeared again in early 1953 in the form of the "doctors' plot" in Stalin's last days, when hundreds of Jewish physicians in the Soviet Union were arrested and some of them killed on the charge of having caused the death of prominent Communist leaders... Similar charges were made in the 1980s and 1990s in radical Arab nationalist and Muslim fundamentalist propaganda that accused the Jews of spreading AIDS and other infectious diseases.[3]

	<TEXT> My only claim is that the world is not what science says it is

What does science say the world is and how is it wrong?  

there are energies that science cannot quantify in any means in accordance to popular theory

Really? Name them and tell me how science gets it wrong.

I'm not a scientist

***GASP!!!***

I am experienced in martial arts and how the transfer of energy can heal.

Martial arts, literally combat practices, are not about healing; they are about self defense, usually by means of causing harm, injury, incapacitation, or even death to a threatening party. It is not about healing, and certainly nothing to do with magical energies. Whatever dojo you're attending that is preaching this nonsense is ripping you off.

My only point is that just because a scientist can't prove it doesn't mean it's wrong in some cases.

Science isn't about proving things. There's hypothesis, evidence, law, and theory, but no credible scientist goes bandying the word "proof" about. Science leaves "proofs" to mathematics and hard liquor.  

Keep an open mind and realize that the world is simply not what the mainstream so violently declares it to be.

What "mainstream" is "violently" declaring the world to be what? You're just writing words. None of this means anything.

 There are a lot of paths in life including more ion tune with natural energy and those more in tune with defined science, but we are nowhere close enough to declare absolutely that one is right and the other is wrong.

The thing about evidence is that it supports the real; there is no disproving a negative. The "paths" you speak of are more accurately described as those who deal in reality and those who prefer fantasy. As to "right and wrong," if you're not hurting anybody, I could not care less what you believe in.

 I don't understand why my view is so violently opposed other than flat out determination to ignore certain things.

I don't think you understand the definition of the word "violent," and if you chose to believe in magical energies, you are the one ignoring certain things, like a burden of proof. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I had to scroll this far down to find the most sensible comment on this thread.

Hate to state the obvious here, but we live in a capitalist society in which the film industry and the movie theaters are trying to make money. If the 3D version wasn't more financially rewarding, they wouldn't do it. They're not in business to lose money.

So to all of you bitching about this, vote with your dollars. If you already are, assume that the people who prefer 3D are voting with their dollars too and you're being outvoted. 

Stop trying to force feed us this gimmick format. 

Find me the theater that is forcing anyone to see movies at all, let alone 3D ones. They're making business decisions based on where the money is. If anyone is forcing it, it's the people who like it, who logically are outspending those who don't. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is the correct answer. The cartoon was the only time any such thing happened.

Wikipedia has a nice write-up of the episode:

The Savage Land appeared in some episodes of the X-Men TV series. It served as the location of Mister Sinister's base. A prominent feature about it was a device designed by Sinister that negated the powers of any mutant in the Savage Land save for Sinister's own forces, rendering the X-Men powerless while fighting him (With the exception of Wolverine's claws as they were a 'bonus' of the Weapon X process, although they would thus cause damage to his hands when used) until the machinery was destroyed. Magneto and Professor X spent much of the show's second season trapped in the Savage Land (Xavier's legs having fortunately been restored as a result of the loss of his powers) until Sinister used them as bait to lure the X-Men into a trap in the season finale, Sinister's forces subsequently being defeated when Wolverine escaped capture and teamed up with Ka-Zar to infiltrate the base and defeat Sinister. In "Savage Land, Savage Heart," the X-Men return to the Savage Land to help Ka-Zar and Shanna fight the threat of Garokk. </TEXT>

Another one I didn't find all that exciting and now I'm really getting why. I appreciate the insight and I think I may be well-served by reading a Hemingway biography before delving into more Hemingway, and I may even give The Sun Also Rises another read after all these posts so adeptly defending its merits. 

Also, thank you for the explanation of the title. It's actually quite apt now that you've put it in context.

This really has become my favorite sub precisely because of threads like this. I would have read it, not liked it because I clearly didn't fully understand it, and I would have unfairly written off a classic by a master. Instead I've been given a wealth of knowledge and means by which to better appreciate it.

You've all been wonderful to take the time. Thank you. </TEXT>

satisfied

adjective

adjective: satisfied


contented; pleased.

"satisfied customers"

All "somewhat" and "very" do is add a degree of scale to the answer, which is "satisfied" either way, just more or less so. Neither could possibly be read as negative by any sensible person who knows what the word means.

It's the difference between saying, "I kind of like it" and "I like it a lot." Either way, you like it. </TEXT>

The "DC" in "DC Comics" is a reference to Detective Comics, but doesn't actually stand for Detective Comics, if that makes sense. It's not a redundancy to say "DC Comics." Because a division of DC Entertainment, the "Comics" distinguishes the branch as which subsidiary we're talking about. </TEXT>
