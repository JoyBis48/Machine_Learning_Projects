	<TEXT> I really didn't know what to expect and honestly didn't expect to raise anything for what was a personal project for me. I've been studying Malcolm X for about ten years and wanted to put together a 1,500 page collection of speeches, debates and interviews. After about a week, it's been successfully funded! I've still got three weeks to go, so hopefully I'll raise some more. My only tip: Social media was actually quite helpful in spreading the word.

	<TEXT> Two points:

Without fail, there's someone in every Akira thread who has to make the point that if you like the movie, you'll love the Manga. This time, I'm that guy. As much as I like the movie, the ending is fairly opaque and lots of the story is necessarily missing. Again, I like the movie, a lot, but the Manga, to me, is where Otomo really shines as a genius. That he wrote and drew it is a major, serious artistic achievement. It's a lot more mature because it's able to flesh out the characters and the plot. Just check out Volume 1, you won't regret it.

Second, here's [Godspeed You! Black Emperor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wG5d_eeGQxE), a movie about Japanese bike gangs that documents a phenomenon that I'm sure was an influence on Akira. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The problem I have with the Bechdel Test is that it's simply a quantitative and not a qualitative judgment. Whether or not a film passes the test says nothing about the quality of a film, only whether or not it passes some arbitrary gender rule. Having established that passing or failing the test does not say anything about a film being good or bad makes the test completely and totally irrelevant in my book (see: Reservoir Dogs, Lawrence of Arabia, The Wild Bunch, My Dinner with Andre or 12 Angry Men.) What's next? Let's see if the film has two named black characters who talk to each other about something other than a white person. Let's see if the film has two named LGBT characters who talk to each other about something other than a straight character. Whatever. How about you make an engaging story in an interesting way. That's the only test I care about. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A perfect example of what I'm talking about. I'm sure it's an interesting book, but there's not one single shred of hard evidence in your post. Everybody who has even a passing interest in JFK's assassination knows who Mohrenschildt was. Mailer's book spends chapters on him. But conspiracy theorists always assume everyone else is a moron. Let's put aside all of the evidence of Oswald's life, the witnesses who heard the shots coming from right above them in the book depository, Oswald's attempt on Edwin Walker, the murder of Tippit and all the other evidence and keep going down the rabbit hole...

	<TEXT> I've said it before and I'll say it again: the problem with the JFK conspiracy theories is that in 50 years, there is not one single shred of hard evidence suggesting that there was any kind of conspiracy. On the other hand, there is a mountain of hard evidence that Lee Harvey Oswald did it. Every conspiracy theory is simply conjecture and hypothesis with no hard evidence whatsoever. It's fun to speculate, but that's all it will ever be, speculation. Evidence and reason and logic all point to Lee Harvey Oswald.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You are completely wrong about John Woo. I'm guessing...just guessing here...that you've never seen Hard Boiled or The Killer? His Hollywood movies are mediocre compared to those two. Hard Boiled is probably the best action movie ever made. Neither of them are brainless. Also, check out Red Cliff. Stunning.

	<TEXT> Dude, I could not agree more. Eraserhead is unique and fascinating, especially for the time it came out. Blue Velvet is a brilliant anti-Reagan film (not literally, but it puts the lie to the whole small-town America myth). I actually really like Dune. I think it's one of the best sci-fi movies of the 80s. The special effects hold up 30 years later.

The rest of his oeuvre leaves me cold. Lost Highway was almost unwatchable. Mulholland Dr. was just meh. Same with Twin Peaks. He relies way too much on: a) very slowly paced scenes to create "atmosphere" and "tension" that end up just dragging the whole film to a screeching halt, b) breaking the rules of reality in a way that empowers the "it's whatever you want it to be" crowd instead of presenting a cogent story and c) a repetitive attempt to parody a mythological view of America with a fake-50s style that just seems hackneyed after the 10th time he does it.

It's not a technical incompetence, it's just the choices he makes to tell his stories that do nothing for me. Other people like him. Fine. But to put him in the pantheon of Great Directors seems a stretch to say the least. Pretty sure I'll never bother with one of his movies ever again.

	<TEXT> Godspeed You! Black Emperor (Goddo Supdo Y! Burakku Enper) is a 1976 Japanese black-and-white 16 mm documentary film, 90 minutes long, by director Mitsuo Yanagimachi, which follows the exploits of young Japanese motorcyclists, the "Black Emperors". The 1970s in Japan saw the rise of a motorcycling movement called the bszoku, which drew the interest of the media. The movie follows a member of the "Black Emperors" motorcycle club and his interaction with his parents after he gets in trouble with the police.

The Canadian post-rock band Godspeed You! Black Emperor took their name from the film. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In general, with artistic endeavours, we get out of it what we put into it, and for me, Lynch just doesn't fit that mould. I get less out of it than I put into it. He just doesn't work for me at all. I don't have a problem with ambiguity or surrealism, I love Jodorowsky's work, but I think there still needs to be a cogent vision in the work for it to have merit. If it's largely indecipherable, I find it tedious. I don't think that's the case for his early work, but as is usually the case, directors just don't get better with age. As I said, having just seen Lost Highway and Mulholland Drive, bits of which I enjoyed, I just think he's well past his prime. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No, I don't have a problem with ambiguity in art in general, but ambiguity and meaninglessness are two different things. Saying that something is "open to a wide array of interpretations" seems like a bit of a cop-out. I think Lynch is less "open to interpretation" and more "no real intention or meaning or serious thought or actual ideas". Again, I don't think he's completely shit as a director, but more like the emperor with no clothes. To me, there's just no there there and to place him anywhere near Kurosawa or Kubrick or Wilder or Scorsese or Leone or whoever seems like a stretch to say the least. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> On the topic of David Lynch in general...Eraserhead is original and interesting, but hardly a masterpiece. Blue Velvet is excellent, and Dune is actually pretty good. But in general, David Lynch is a second-rate director whose reputation far, far outweighs his actual contribution to the medium. Lost Highway was almost unwatchable and Mulholland Drive, like most of his movies, isn't interesting enough to warrant further research to actually find out what it's about. His over-dedication to atmosphere means most of his movies are too long and generally pretty fucking boring. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Blood Meridian.

*"Men are born for games. Nothing else. Every child knows that play is nobler than work. He knows too that the worth or merit of a game is not inherent in the game itself but rather in the value of that which is put at hazard. Games of chance require a wager to have meaning at all. Games of sport involve the skill and strength of the opponents and the humiliation of defeat and the pride of victory are in themselves sufficient stake because they inhere in the worth of the principals and define them. But trial of chance or trial of worth all games aspire to the condition of war for here that which is wagered swallows up game, player, all.*


*Suppose two men at cards with nothing to wager save their lives. Who has not heard such a tale? A turn of the card. The whole universe for such a player has labored clanking to this moment which will tell if he is to die at that mans hand or that man at his. What more certain validation of a mans worth could there be? This enhancement of the game to its ultimate state admits no argument concerning the notion of fate. The selection of one man over another is a preference absolute and irrevocable and it is a dull man indeed who could reckon so profound a decision without agency or significance either one. In such games as have for their stake the annihilation of the defeated the decisions are quite clear. This man holding this particular arrangement of cards in his hand is thereby removed from existence. This is the nature of war, whose stake is at once the game and the authority and the justification. Seen so, war is the truest form of divination. It is the testing of ones will and the will of another within that larger will which because it binds them is therefore forced to select. War is the ultimate game because war is at last a forcing of the unity of existence. War is god."* </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think this quote from the story accurately sums up the problem with Morgan:

*"Crossing an ocean for a replacement for Larry King, who had ratings problems of his own near the end, was probably not a great idea to begin with. For a cable news station like CNN, major stories are like oxygen. When something important or scary happens in America, many of us have an immediate reflex to turn on CNN. When I find Mr. Morgan telling me what it all means, I have a similar reflex to dismiss what he is saying. It is difficult for him to speak credibly on significant American events because, after all, he just got here."*

And this is not just some knee-jerk anti-British reaction (Personally, I'd like to see Russell Brand take his spot!) but let's be real, if you're going to have a prime-time American news show talking about American events, it would help to have an American in that chair. Maybe now they'll stop fucking around and give the job to Jon Stewart like they should have in the first place. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  You are completely white washing his statements about Jews. 

No, I'm not and I resent the charge that I would, for some reason, defend an anti-Semite. Again, take a look at the videos I've posted on youtube, find even one that you could call anti-Semitic. The closest you're going to get is the interview with [Dr. Kenneth Clark](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9C_e0EUbas) where he is defending the NOI from charges of antisemitism.

Likewise, I'd be happy to email you (or anyone else) the 800-pages of speeches, debates and interviews that I compiled. You will not find one single instance of antisemitism. Not. One. In fact, what you will find are statements like this:

*"If you have read what the Honorable Elijah Muhammad has written and he has written much, I dont think you can find an article where he has ever pointed out the Jew as an exploiter of the black man. He speaks of the exploiter. Period. He doesnt break it down in terms of Frenchmen or an Englishmen or a Jew or a German, he speaks of the exploiter and sometimes the man who is the most guilty of exploitation will think you are pointing the finger at him and put out the propaganda that youre anti-this or anti-that, we make no distinction between exploitation and exploiter." (Debate with Bayard Rustin, 1960)*

Later, after he left the NOI, he stated:

"Since I learned the truth in Mecca, **my dearest friends have come to include all kinds  some Christians, Jews**, Buddhists, Hindus, agnostics, and even atheists! I have friends who are called capitalists, Socialists, and Communists! Some of my friends are moderates, conservatives, extremists  some are even Uncle Toms! My friends today are black, brown, red, yellow, and white!" (Autobiography of Malcolm X, p. 375)

You are confusing Malcolm X with Farrakhan who I think, quite clearly, is an anti-Semite.

 In the meantime, may I ask what those people being Jewish had to do with his claim that they were taking advantage of the black community? 

Are you denying that some of the people who exploited black people were Jewish? Are you denying that some of them were Italian? Some were Polish? Some were black? It's a simple fact that some black people were exploited by some Jewish people and some Italians and some Poles and some Blacks. The fact that they were Jewish does not make them immune to criticism. I get the impression that you think any criticism of anyone who is Jewish is automatically antisemitism. It is not. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As someone who has uploaded [several hours](http://www.youtube.com/user/train_subject8978) of Malcolm X speeches and debates to youtube and compiled an Ebook of over [800 pages](http://malcolmxfiles.blogspot.ca/p/malcolm-x-e-book.html) of speeches, debates and interviews, I think it's safe to say that I'm fairly familiar with Malcolm X. Thus, it seems absurd to suggest that I'm not familiar with his beliefs when he was in the Nation of Islam. You can hear Malcolm X repudiate his previous position [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgqIek2TYvg), [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDQ2EKmc3g) and [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xXB48l-OlE). You can read my own take on it [here](http://malcolmxfiles.blogspot.ca/p/the-men-who-killed-malcolm-x.html). You can criticize him for beliefs that he rejected if you like, but that seems like cherry-picking facts in order to make a point, which seems fundamentally dishonest to me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sorry, but that's complete nonsense. You can take a look at either the [several hours of footage that I've uploaded](http://www.youtube.com/user/train_subject8978), or if you like, you can ask for a copy of the free Ebook that I created with over [800 pages of speeches, debates and interviews](http://malcolmxfiles.blogspot.ca/p/malcolm-x-e-book.html), and I challenge you to find this "outspoken anti-semitism". This is just more of the same slander that's been going on for almost fifty years. There are some speeches were he is critical of Jewish people who own buildings where black people were being charged exorbitant rent, but that was about the exorbitant rent, not the fact that they were Jewish. In fact, in several speeches, he uses Jews as a model for black people, when he was arguing for a separate black state. The claim that Malcolm X was an outspoken anti-semite is ridiculous. BTW, [Manning Marable's book was crap](http://mxmission.blogspot.ca/2011/04/paper-tiger-manning-marables-poison-pen.html). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Contrary to popular belief, Malcolm X NEVER preached violence. He preached self-defense. If someone comes at you with a gun or a knife or a rope with the intention of doing you harm, you have the right to defend yourself. This was, unfortunately, a novel concept in 1960. If you read up on MLK, you will see that he was becoming more and  more aligned with Malcolm X and vice versa. It is a fallacy to suggest that they were on opposite sides of the fence. Thanks for the comment.

	<TEXT> It is disappointing, to say the least, that the perception of Malcolm X as a racist and a hatemonger remains. It is unsurprising that someone as intelligent as Malcolm X could easily forsee this viewpoint. As he wrote in his autobiography:

*"I want you to watch and see if I'm not right in what I say: that the white man in his press, is going to identify me with "hate." He will make use of me dead, as he has made use of me alive, as a convenient symbol of "hatred"and that will help him to escape facing the truth."* 

While I certainly understand the internet's general bias against self-promotion, I must post [this essay that I wrote](http://malcolmxfiles.blogspot.ca/p/the-men-who-killed-malcolm-x.html) several years ago. Perhaps it will help change the minds of people who still identify him with 'hate'. At the very least, if you're going to slander him, you should read his autobiography and get your facts straight. I run the largest collection of [Malcolm X videos on youtube](http://www.youtube.com/user/train_subject8978). I would suggest that those who think Malcolm X was a racist and a hatemonger listen to the man himself and see that any such depiction is absurd, insulting and simply wrong. He was certainly a vocal opponent of white hate while he was in the NOI, but he repudiated some of those views after he left. I maintain that many of those criticisms of White America were valid then and are valid now.

Thanks to the OP for the post. </TEXT>

Yeah, this is definitely one of the main problems. He's sort of made to be the protagonist of the movie, but in the book he's clearly unhinged. One of the problems in the movie is that he's got that sort of cool, gravelly voice that makes him sound like Clint Eastwood or something, but in the book his voice is described as completely monotone, devoid of any emotion, because he's severely disturbed. He's also a proto-fascist, who identifies very strongly with the right-wing. BTW, he's based on Ditko's [Mr. A](http://ditkocultist.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/graphic-illusions-mr-a0001.jpg). </TEXT>

Having said that, there were two things that the movie did brilliantly, one was The Comedian, they really nailed him. The other was Dr. Manhattan. His flashback sequence explaining his origin with the quiet, calm narration and the Philip Glass music was really, really well done. 

What would be great is Terry Gilliam doing the comic as a miniseries for HBO.
