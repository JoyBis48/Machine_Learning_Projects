	<TEXT> It's is fairly expensive and there is a lot that must be done before Japan will allow them into the country. There's also a 180 day quarantine period which can be done before you import them. I brought 2 cats and cost around $700. Some people go into the thousands depending on how they are transporting them and what vet they go to. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We had to have 2 rabies vaccinations done 30 days apart and then a FAVN blood test. His quarantine started from the day the blood test was done and can be started 180 days before entering the country. We then had to get approval from the Japanese government. He was checked by a quarantine official immediately upon entering the country and before going through customs. It is a very difficult and expensive process. We actually brought 2 cats with us. </TEXT>
