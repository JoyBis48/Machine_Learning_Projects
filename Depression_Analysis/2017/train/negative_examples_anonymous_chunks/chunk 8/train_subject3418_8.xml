	<TEXT> Speaking just from my experiences, I definitely felt that way during my first time in China. Most of the people I've talked to who lived in China were students who studied there for a semester (like me) or maybe a year, or English teachers who were there for a short period of time. Since most know going into it that it's just temporary, it doesn't really feel like the "real world" of work or putting down roots. 

In my case I (along with 20 others from my school) were only there a semester. Classes were a joke, everything was super cheap (early 2000's), and we had tons of free time. So I had half a year of no real responsibilities or expectations, which definitely made it seem unreal.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm meeting with an ANG recruiter later this week but wanted to get your opinions on 2 things:
1. Joining enlisted vs officer? I've heard varying opinions on pros/cons for both. I've got a masters in public policy fwiw. 
2. If I do go the officer route (which is super hard to get into I know) would I go through OCS/AMS and then a tech school? Or is there a different way that officers obtain the specialized knowledge for their field?  </TEXT>

"I tear at my body armor and get it opened. With my right hand on the the sleeve that holds my five-pound front armor plate, I grab the insurgent's hair and ram his head forward, jamming his chin into his chest. He's pinned in place now. All I have to do is finish him.

I beat him with the inside of my armor plate. I smash it against his face again and again and again until blood flows all over the inside of my shirt. He kicks and flails and screams. Every scream gets cut off by another blow from the plate..." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't think so, largely because of the USSR. Stalingrad was in 1942-1943 and the Nazis were retreating from the East following that. The Soviets did get a lot of help and goods from the U.S. Lend-Lease so that might have taken a hit if Germany's navy was improved, but the Russians would still been able to supply most of their troops without it.

Still, I think the Nazi's would have eventually been beaten, or at least forced into a stalemate, it just would have been more drawn out and bloody. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I can see that. There was an article (that I can't seem to find now...) about drone pilots who were having a hard time with killing targets. When they interviewed them they said that sometimes a drone could be assigned to monitor a house for days or weeks, and the pilots would see their whole family life, when dinner was each day, when the kids played in the front yard, etc. And then one day they would just get the order to fire on one of the people who was confirmed to be a terrorist. Takes a psychological toll, even from a thousand miles away.  </TEXT>
