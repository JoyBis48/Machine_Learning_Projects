If this gets picked the money would go towards my grandma's assisted living, all the upcoming surgeries my other grandmother needs, vacation money for my grandpa, show paid for for my cousin and brother, student loans for myself, and probably spoil my parents with a few things for everything they're done for me </TEXT>

	<TEXT> once I was getting back from a party, my dorm mate and I had a good amount of mutual friends, well I get back and they are all cutting up coke and then mixing it with baking soda. like a 4:1 baking soda to coke ratio. and they intended to sell this to people that I knew. So I told the people not to buy from them and they listened so my dorm mate and his friends threatened me because of it but ended up doing nothing. Hah fucking idiots  </TEXT>
