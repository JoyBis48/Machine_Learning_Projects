	<TEXT> I'm a girl...if a guy were approaching me at the bar he would need to be sober enough to hold a conversation with, and simply asking me for my name, and saying that I look familiar (or something dumb like that) would be enough to grab my attention.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A re-occurring dream I have is that I'm a kid playing on a playground with the Rugrats (yes the t.v. show), and I find a hidden doorway at the bottom of one of the play sets.  I open it and it's full of lava.  All of a sudden I see my mom coming up out of the lava asking me to come with her.  That's usually when I wake up.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think the general population views me as nice...and for the most part I agree.  At the same time people can't read my mind, so they don't know what I'm actually thinking... </TEXT>
