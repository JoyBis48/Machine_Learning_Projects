	<TEXT> I agree that his economic stance is just horrendous - but I really don't think Paul has a good chance at winning, and my ONLY reason for thinking that is because he'll be running under the republican ticket. The republican party has done a well and thorough job of making themselves look even worse than the democrats, which is his downfall. 

They control congress so it's not out of question. However the dems seem to be the sexier party nowadays. It's unfortunate honestly, because Rand, Justin Amash, and Thomas Massie are very good Republicans. Bernie is the only Dem I see that is making waves with integrity. Hillary will win the primary, she'll go against bush and a battle of legacy will ensue, Hillary will win. Or against Walker and Hillary will still win because he is just a run of the mill republican and the country won't vote for that.

Well, a candidate needs funds to get the message out there. Many times have otherwise good candidates been outspent by horrible candidates that take tons of money.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I understand where you're coming from, as I've considered it myself. But I absolutely can't support his ridiculous stance on the economy that will do more damage to our country than his integrity will do good. We've had good people that were bad presidents, ex Jimmy Carter, and it won't set any gears in motion that will create good presidents in the future. Plus, he won't get along with congress either because of how belligerent he is. 

Rand Paul is the best bet at the moment. A candidate must take contributions from corporations in order to even compete and Rand Paul is on par with Sanders in terms of integrity, but with better views. I pay very close attention to Paul and his campaign, he is the best for the job. Either way, his tax plan isn't very friendly to large subsidized corporations and neither is his foreign policy plan for military contracting companies.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's something you have to get used to. I never played it originally but then picked it up on MCC and loved it. You just have to learn the game and how to shoot a pistol. It's also possible you just got unlucky with god opponents. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think you're going a little overboard. The game is pretty fun once you get used to it, it's halo in its purest form, and was really meant for 2v2 fun couch gameplay. Plus, the pistol is the BR in that game, I really don't see a problem with it. To be honest I think you just suck at it so you hate it for the reasons you suck.

The game has the widest skill gap out of any halos </TEXT>
