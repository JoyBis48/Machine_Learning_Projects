	<TEXT> Pew Research: The number of people who identify themselves as atheists in the United States has been rising, modestly but steadily, in recent years. Our aggregated data from 2012 show that 2.4% of American adults say they are atheists when asked about their religious identity, up from 1.6% in 2007.

	<TEXT> My daughter was home schooled by her mother (when we were still married) starting in 5th grade.. They both wanted it so I went along with it. The first year went well. 6th grade was a disaster. For 7th grade she transferred to the Stanford Online High School. That went a little better the first year, then things crashed and burned. There were no opportunities for socialization, and the program didn't even meet the UC system requirements. 

I worked hard, and finally got her into one of the best public high schools you could go to. She is so much happier there and finally doing great. 

Unless there is some compelling reason for home schooling, I can't recommend it.  </TEXT>

9 therefore, behold, I will open the side of Moab from the cities, from his cities which are on his frontiers, the glory of the country, Beth-jeshimoth, Baal-meon, and Kiriathaim, 10unto the children of the east, [to go] against the children of Ammon; and I will give them for a possession, that the children of Ammon may not be remembered among the nations. 11and I will execute judgments upon Moab; and they shall know that I am Jehovah. 12Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because that Edom hath dealt against the house of Judah by taking vengeance, and hath greatly offended, and revenged himself upon them; 13 therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah, I will stretch out my hand upon Edom, and will cut off man and beast from it; and I will make it desolate from Teman; even unto Dedan shall they fall by the sword. 14And I will lay my vengeance upon Edom by the hand of my people Israel; and they shall do in Edom according to mine anger and according to my wrath; and they shall know my vengeance, saith the Lord Jehovah. 15Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because the Philistines have dealt by revenge, and have taken vengeance with despite of soul to destroy with perpetual enmity; 16therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Behold, I will stretch out my hand upon the Philistines, and I will cut off the Cherethites, and destroy the remnant of the sea coast. 17And I will execute great vengeance upon them with wrathful rebukes; and they shall know that I am Jehovah, when I shall lay my vengeance upon them. </TEXT>

New International Version:
There she lusted after her lovers, whose genitals were like those of donkeys and whose emission was like that of horses.

New Living Translation:
She lusted after lovers with genitals as large as a donkey's and emissions like those of a horse.

English Standard Version:
and lusted after her lovers there, whose members were like those of donkeys, and whose issue was like that of horses.

New American Standard Bible: 
"She lusted after their paramours, whose flesh is like the flesh of donkeys and whose issue is like the issue of horses.

King James Bible:
For she doted upon their paramours, whose flesh is as the flesh of asses, and whose issue is like the issue of horses.

Holman Christian Standard Bible:
and lusted after their lovers, whose sexual members were like those of donkeys and whose emission was like that of stallions. 

International Standard Version:
She lusted after her paramours, whose genitals are like those of donkeys, and whose emissions are like those of horses. 

NET Bible:
She lusted after their genitals--as large as those of donkeys, and their seminal emission was as strong as that of stallions.

GOD'S WORD Translation:
She lusted after her lovers, whose genitals were like those of donkeys and whose semen was like that of horses.

Jubilee Bible 2000:
For she doted upon their paramours, whose flesh is as the flesh of asses and whose issue is like the issue of horses.

King James 2000 Bible:
For she doted upon her paramours, whose flesh is as the flesh of donkeys, and whose issue is like the issue of horses.

In 2009, the NYPD responded to 4.4 million radio-received assignments. Of those, 206,000 calls involved weapons of some kind. Despite those massive numbers, there were only 47 cases in which an officer intentionally fired a gun in a conflict. </TEXT>

I have no clue why they think this, or how it would make its way that far through the city, but I hope they are correct. 

I used to live on the "Peninsula" and have seen mountain lions twice in the hills.

They are majestic, and a bit frightening at the same time. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There's a passage I got memorized. Ezekiel 25:17. "**The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of the darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy My brothers. And you will know I am the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon you.**" Now... I been sayin' that shit for years. And if you ever heard it, that meant your ass. You'd be dead right now. I never gave much thought to what it meant. I just thought it was a cold-blooded thing to say to a motherfucker before I popped a cap in his ass. But I saw some shit this mornin' made me think twice. See, now I'm thinking: maybe it means you're the evil man. And I'm the righteous man. And Mr. 9mm here... he's the shepherd protecting my righteous ass in the valley of darkness. Or it could mean you're the righteous man and I'm the shepherd and it's the world that's evil and selfish. And I'd like that. But that shit ain't the truth. The truth is you're the weak. And I'm the tyranny of evil men. But I'm tryin', Ringo. I'm tryin' real hard to be the shepherd. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Unfortunately, Principal Gutierrez has a long history of racism when it comes to how she runs Harvey Scott K-8 School.

During the schools lunch hour (when, presumably, the offensive sandwiches were served), Harvey Scott K-8 School also offered a segregated lunchtime drum class thats limited to black and Hispanic boys only. **Girls, white boys, or Asian boys are strictly prohibited**.

Gutierrezs response?

When white people do it, it is not a problem, she said. But if its for kids of color, then its a problem? Break it down for me. Thats your white privilege, and your whiteness. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Neuroscientists believe REM sleep serves different roles in newborns and infants: It allows their brains to build pathways, become integrated and, later, helps them develop language. (Similarly, juvenile birds learn songs during REM sleep.) While all that grunt work is going on, they lack the head space and the ability to imagine themselves as the heroes of baby adventures, or to dream up fantasy toys.

Dreaming, neuroscientists think, is a cognitive process that arises in early childhood, once babies have acquired the capacity to imagine things visually and spatially. Babies do have experiences, before and after they are born. I would imagine that, primaily, [this is what babies dream about.](http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2227/2752605590_e50c3a9923_z.jpg) </TEXT>
