Read the article and it shows:

 Prices have jumped some 50 cents on average in the L.A. area since last week, according to AAA.

The gas station by my house where I usually get gas was $3.19 a gallon last week. Now it is $3.89. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As I see gas prices rise 50 cents a gallon overnight, I have to ask who is controlling this crap? What excuse are they using now? 

Refinery problems? Employee strike? Or some other lame excuse that they pull out of their ass.


Edit: Must just be in So Cal.
No matter what problems we have had in the past, never have they risen  50 cents overnight.  </TEXT>
