	<TEXT> Story time:


During a party at a friends place,one of the friends got really,really drunk.Like he didn't know where the hell he was most of the time.At one point,i see him wondering outside and tell him lets go inside and have you sit down.

But I have to find my brother!

At this point his brother was standing next to him and looking at me trying to figure out what was going on.So I tell him:


Your brother's right here,lets go inside,he'll go there with us.

Instead of responding to that,he gives me a long stare and gives me a slap across my face.Now if he wasn't a good friend of mine and half my size,this would have ended a lot different.So i pick him up,take him inside and lay him on the couch and tell him to stay there while i go get something for him so he sobers up.


Now,as I'm walking my female best friend walks up to me and asks me why i look angry.To which i respond by explaining what happened.Now the funny part.


She starts screaming at me.Direct quotes:


You cant be fucking angry at someone thats drunk!


But im not angry at him!


Yes you fucking are i see it in your eyes!


Im slowly starting to get confused here,as I would never hurt the guy even when he was sober.
Dude Im just going to go get him something to sober up


No!Youre staying right here because you will hurt him if you go there!

At this point people are gathering around and laughing due to her screaming at me and me looking confused as fuck.Later on,instead of apologizing the only thing she said was We both made mistakes then.

Thats pretty much what caused me to stop hanging out with her for some time,but alas shes still the best friend i ever had. </TEXT>
