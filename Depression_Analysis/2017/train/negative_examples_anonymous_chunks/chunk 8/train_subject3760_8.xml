	<TEXT> The NI ban is heading for a [Judicial Review](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/26/northern-ireland-gay-marriage-ban-first-uk-civil-partners-win-judicial-review) so I imagine it will end up happening the same way as it did in the US. 

The last assembly vote was 47/49 against with four SDLP members failing to vote despite the whip. After the Irish referendum minds will have been changed - as I said its a question of when not if. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Personally I see this tension as the core of the issue. 

There are groups that want to view marriage as a purely religious construct and therefore their rejection of LGBQT marriage or anything associated with it is a matter of personal freedom of choice and therefore protected - but that simply isn't the case and it hasn't been for a very long time because of the depth of legal status of marriage in national and international law. 

Attempting to limit access to marriage denies fundamental freedoms to LGBQT people - freedoms so fundamental that most people barely think of them or realise that they're even there until they don't have them.

Ultimately everyone is free to accept or reject LGBQT marriage in their personal lives, but they don't' have the right to impose their beliefs on other people in society and thereby limit other's freedoms for no good reason. 

Why wouldn't a baker, for example, that doesn't wish to service LGBQT couples simply put a sign in their shop window to that effect? This would save everyone embarrassment! The reason is that they know that such a sign would hurt their business even among the straight community - in other words they *know* that there is a difference between their personal beliefs and the functionality of their work.

On the company issue, I don't have a problem with your position and I don't think it's bigoted, but I do think it's unrealistic. Can we really live in a society where the personal religious views of a company's CEO affect *your* partner's ability to receive part of *your* pension should you die? Equally if that is the standard then why couldn't a company turn around and refuse to pay survivor benefits to anyone regardless of their sexuality - these things cut both ways. </TEXT>

This is cynicism. You failed to even attempt to understand this person's perfectly reasonable position and dismissed it out of hand. I don't agree with her position, but I at least recognise it as accurate from a statist standpoint.

I say this as a 20 year IT veteran. *There is no privacy* the idea that there was at some stage some kind of privacy in our lives was a construct based on security by obscurity i.e. government and private enterprise was in possession of much data in paper or quasi-digital form but lacked the tools to centralise, regurgitate and mine the data in a meaningful way - obviously that has changed significantly.

Recently a security firm went out in Victoria Street in London and asked people for their passwords and email addresses in return for a free coffee or a chocolate bar - 78% of respondents provided those details - that is how little people care about their own privacy, security, and that of their employer. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Its a very big thing indeed - its all very well for people to argue that marriage is a religious status alone but that simply isn't the case in modern society - so many of our legal systems and international laws are built on conveying rights via the simple term 'marriage' that those without the ability to marry are quickly deprived of basic rights by simply stepping over an international border.

Survivor benefits could indeed be conveyed by contracts but there are a couple of big problems with that. Firstly it's within the discretion of the company - Apple will pay out, Hobby Lobby won't. Secondly when it comes to insurance its a matter of the legal term - legally they're only required to recognise the status of certain relationships and without a change in the law that doesn't happen because it would increase costs - this leads to LGBQT people paying more for certain kinds of insurance and having to have specially drawn up wills etcetera.

	<TEXT> Yes to the former. The term 'marriage' is codified into so many international laws, treaties and intra-legal system recognition agreements that LGBQT couples literally need to be in something called a 'marriage' to obtain basic rights when travelling or moving overseas.

To be clear a same-sex couple with a civil partnership conducted in the UK could not emigrate to Canada as a married couple because the UK law isn't recognised there. If the same couple were travelling in Canada and were in a serious accident the partners would be unable to make medical decisions for one and other, and in some cases their family (if they disapprove of the marriage) may seek to prevent one from even seeing the other (sadly this has happened).

Re:survivor benefits - if your marriage isn't recognised you wouldn't be able to obtain life insurance payouts, death benefits from an employer, pension payouts etc. This leaves the surviving partners in a very tricky financial position. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It is. But...

Here in the UK Churchill (a lion of the right wing) didn't consider the NHS or Welfare State Socialist, and wrote as much. That's not a position that a modern Conservative in England would recognise. Our right has drifted further right in some policy areas to the point that in policy terms, thanks to inertia, there is no recognisably left or centrist party - I'm beginning to wonder if left/right is even a useful distinction.

In the US the GOP has gone *so* far right/authoritarian that it's practically a fringe party - but the Democrats are, as a function of that drift, being pulled further right in order to hold their electoral coalition together. So Obama's Democratic party are essentially occupying the same economic space as Reagan albeit with a much more liberal view of society and individual freedoms.

I don't know if this is a good or a bad thing to be honest with you. </TEXT>

Everyone is complaining about the engine regs, but, looking at the rate of token spend, the problems Renault and Honda have are way more fundamental than even unlimited development could fix. They can't make the systems they have work.

Also F1 is a business as are the teams. From Mercedes perspective they've invested four years and close to a billion dollars on that car - how is it then fair to ask them to basically cease their development and allow the other teams to catch up? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ultimately its a business decision - Raikkonen's performance issues have dragged the team's media coverage into negative territory for two season's straight - drowning out positive coverage of Ferrari's nascent improvement this year and becoming constant distraction for the team.

I say this as a huge Kimi fan who thinks he should have been a three time WDC winner. Kimi is a serious problem for Ferrari. He isn't delivering on track and he's not promoting the team well either - his 'fuck you' approach to media was refreshing when he was delivering in races, now it just looks foolish and unengaged.

Ferrari could get a more consistent driver which would do more for their image and performance elsewhere very easily. Bottas appears to be the obvious choice, IMO it should be Hulkenberg or Ricciardo, but at this point any of them would be better than the present situation (Sadly. Very sadly in fact.) </TEXT>

Also find out the name of the chief constable and then contact them directly via email cc'ing your MP, the format is usually firstname.surname@domain.name (minus the www). Its surprisingly effective. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No. That was Bernie's point about social media last year - the much derided Rolex comment. The point in plainer language is that engaging socially might be good for fans (and this isn't a reason why we shouldn't do it), but it can't provide the revenue or cashflow needed to operate F1.

Race fees and TV rights make up (50/50) $1.3 billion of F1's 1.6 billion revenue $1 billion of which is distributed to the teams. No amount of advertising or sponsorship on youtube or another streaming model will replace that kind of revenue. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I very much doubt that you have any experience or knowledge in the sector given the crass nature of your remarks and total ignorance of the law as it pertains to contracts and housing. 

What I said was that statutory protections for *tenants* would be a good place to start. Statutory Government safety standards for types of rented accommodation are *not* protection *of* tenants *from* landlords any more than the British Standards Kite Mark is protection of the consumer from harm - they concern quality standards and/or safety of product, not individual rights in a dispute. 

The only way a tenant can fight a non-financial, eviction, or semi-financial dispute with a landlord is in the civil courts (you would know this if you knew what you were talking about). I really don't know why the SCC is so important to you - it offers a service to landlords for rent arrears and has little use for tenants.

Anyway this isn't a discussion, you're completely wrong in what you had to say, and saying it with crass embellishments just makes you sound dumb.

	<TEXT> Umm, no. I can see you have absolutely no experience of such matters and a poor attitude - 'hand holding' - really? What an ignorant thing to say.

There are standards for HMO's, which in *some* areas have to be licenced and inspected prior to letting, and there are standards for private rented accommodation which *should* be observed but these are *not* statutory protections for the tenant with criminal penalties attached - they concern the council's relationship with the landlord alone and the enforcement is exclusively civil. 

A tenant can complain and environmental health might turn up in 6 months and issue a letter to a private landlord requesting changes and threatening legal action if they don't undertake the prescribed work, but enforcement only takes place for serious multiple breaches and its a ponderous process. This does not affect the contractual relationship between landlord and tenant - it most certainly does not overrule the contract in the slightest which is an entirely separate legal document dealt with mainly by the county courts.

As to the small claims court you cannot take landlord/tenant (act) disputes to it, as it deals with money alone. You can pursue debts that way so it's of little use to tenants but very popular with landlords. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think you can take that view if you wish but [experts in the sector disagree](http://www.propertyreporter.co.uk/property/could-tackling-multiple-home-ownership-assist-housing-crisis.html). In reality multiple home ownership isn't a symptom at all but one of a number of primary causes - lack of house building is another - all of which need intensive action.

We cant keep building to accommodate demand, land is in short supply, particularly in locations where people most want to live. In reality, there is plenty of property, but with some investors owning numerous buy-to-let properties, prices continue to rise making it impossible for first-time buyers to pull together enough deposit to make that first step.

	<TEXT> The idea itself is not so fanciful, its basically what we do with a large number of shared ownership properties in the social housing sector - short term tenancies are a disaster for many in generation rent, disrupt social cohesion, and a fix for that problem is badly needed.

And in fact he does get it. There is a housing crisis in this country - private let landlords have benefited and continue to benefit from [14 Billion in tax breaks](http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/may/26/landlords-14bn-tax-breaks-buy-to-let-expansion-mortgage-interest) - they are a group that has grossly profited from their own shrinking of the housing stock which by turns pushed up house prices whilst pushing locals out.

Personally I'd much rather listen to some radical ideas on the topic than the baleful ignorance of Cameron and co whilst they plunder the working poor and disabled. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You could argue the same thing about any trained profession but, as you say, retention is a huge problem within the NHS because (having half a dozen nurses in the family) many trusts treat nurses extremely poorly, pay is relatively low, and conditions can be dreadful. There is little flexibility so nurses like my sister, despite having the PhD level highly specialised qualifications required for top end intensive care nursing, end up in 9 - 5 desk jobs because the trusts can't think of a better way to handle her having a family.

All that said its also true, from a UK economic perspective, that people who receive degree level training earn far more through their lifetimes than people with lower skills qualifications and contribute more to the economy. So it actually doesn't matter if they stay in the profession the country still benefits economically.

Non degree average starting salaries are  17k compared to  31k for those with a degree. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Bernie doesn't own the rights to stream anything, streaming licensing is organised at national broadcaster level e.g. Sky in the UK, RTL in Germany etcetera.

This is why a global streaming solution isn't happening. If FOM wanted to do this they would have to amend the terms of every existing F1 broadcaster contract and/or pay the broadcasters for the privilege of streaming their own race. Even that would only solve half the problem. FOM provides the TV pictures as part of their licensing agreement but it's the broadcasters that own the IP for the commentary and the would have to be paid for that.

50% of the prize fund that the teams get comes to F1 via broadcast rights, so you would also have to be careful not to hurt the teams financially when making the deals to put a streaming solution together.

TL;DR Streaming F1 races has nothing to do with Bernie or FOM because of the way the broadcast licences are organised. </TEXT>

Seb's generation obviously grew up speaking English from a young age and his command is amazing - he has colloquialisms, understands and uses sarcasm, tone, inflection etcetera - many other drivers don't seem to have as much depth. With Massa especially I often wonder how much we're missing of what he's really thinking.

	<TEXT> Many fans claim the 80s and 00s were golden eras of F1 yet these are periods where tyre and fuel management really was to the fore, third placed drivers were often lapped, a small number of drivers won everything in sight, and the organisation of the sport really was a bi-dictatorship between Bernie and Mosely.

The more people know about what's happening the less happy they seem to be.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've (and many others) have said it time and again - the benefits to 'ordinary' working class people for free movement of people and more generally an open immigration policy NEEDS to be made.

I think most people especially in this sub, from the way 'ordinary working class' is routinely used, think of the working class as those engaged in un/semi skilled manual or industrial work and forget completely about the working poor. The definition is in fact those without the ability to live on accumulated capital. That includes increasing amounts people especially with the continuing housing crisis and the piles of student debt being accrued. You've got to throw down 5,000 to get a HGV licence these days on top of 2k to learn to drive a car - a near impossibility for many people at 18 no matter if you're working or middle class.

As far a the benefits of freedom of movement go for 'working class' people go, you have to be in a position to move to realise them.

Care workers, oil rig workers, IT workers and the like are all part of the modern working class can, and have, realised benefits by moving overseas where they are better paid or gain better quality of life - but the reality is that if you're on an hourly waged shift work job in a factory in Northampton freedom of movement is only going to put your wages under pressure. The only way to change that is to educate better and ensure access to education and skills training is freely available to all.

	<TEXT> Exactly right - it has been on the BBC London news though. It'll only make the national news if it's very big and something significant happens.

That said they allegedlly ignored [this protest last year](https://tompride.wordpress.com/2014/06/21/bbc-and-press-ignore-massive-demonstration-against-austerity-in-london/), only [they didn't](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-27962963) at all. In fact that march was also reported in the Guardian, Telegraph, and the Independent.

People on the right and the left always claim the BBC is biased against them, if they can't show intentional bias, then its biased by failure to report, or failure to give the story or story angle they see as important enough attention.

IMO it's mostly the bias of the person complaining showing, not the BBC. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> - UKIP received 4,376,635 votes at the Euro Elections in 2014, a national scale election, but received 3,881,099 at the general election - a *loss* of 495,536 voters.

- In Thanet Farage received 16,026 votes, Thanet North and Thanet South together cast 28,123 votes for UKIP, but virtually the same area elected a UKIP council with 54,230 votes.

- UKIP was polling at 17% in January but only received 12.6% of the vote.

- UKIP didn't get a poll bounce from the leaders debate, and actually dropped in the polls immediately after the challengers debate.

- UKIP performed poorly in all 12 of its top target seats and was beaten into *third* by Labour in half of them.

- It actually *lost* vote share in four target seats based on its 2010 and 2014 performances: South Basildon and East Thurrock -4.43%, Croydon Central -24.45%, Rochester   Strood -11.6%, Clacton -15.3%

In other words Farage isn't nearly as good of a campaigner as people think, and the major UKIP donor Stuart Wheeler (who paid for the campaign) was correct when he described the election as "a failure". This is the reason why there was a leadership coup following Farage's un-resignation. </TEXT>

Just look at yesterday's shenanigans in the House of Commons. Basically the Eurosceptics can't even agree on the rules amongst themselves let alone with anyone else. We have two years of this nonsense to look forward to and the public are already exhausted by the clap trap spewing forth over the issue.

* UKIPs main donors 2001 - 2013 (total, of which less than two million came from other sources, 9,554,314): Paul Sykes, Stuart Wheeler, Julian Blackwell, Sir John Craven, Lord Neidpath, Viscount Michael Cowdray, Lady Yvonne Vinson, Lady Yvonne Collin, Lord Pearson of Rannoch, Clare Barbour, John Malcolm Richards, Christopher Mills, Robin Birley, Crispin Odey, and Andy Brough.

He went on to say

"The team around Nigel himself need to reflect why it was that Thanet voted in a Ukip council but didnt vote in Nigel as the MP for Thanet South."

Similar attacks were made over the leadership un-resignation and GE results by Diane James, Suzanne Evans, Stuart Wheeler and Paul Nuttall.

Pretending this didn't happen or that Wheeler or O'Flynn don't fit the description of a senior members of UKIP is simply ridiculous.

We're taking the GE as a baseline for two reasons firstly its a comparable national scale election, secondly just about every UKIP shipper on this sub has claimed that the Euro elections were a predictor of UKIP's performance in the GE - they're right. 

Labour's performance in the EU election made it look much more competitive in the GE than was the case. The only pluses from the Labour perspective is that it took every Lab/Con marginal, and the 7 most marginal Tory seats were decided collectively by 900 votes. The very most marginal seat went blue by only 47 votes! The next 20 most marginal seats were collectively decided by less than 10,000 votes. That means the Tories are highly vulnerable - Labour or the LibDems could easily call a by-election in a marginal they hold at the right time and sell it as a referendum on Cameron's leadership.

The whole GE was a great deal closer to a coalition than it looked. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Stuart Wheeler is a *very* senior member of the party, one of its longest members, and its largest donor - the UKIP equivalent of Lord Ashcroft. Patrick OFlynn was your campaign director - there are no two people in the party more senior save for Farage himself.

You're under the impression I'm criticising the party or its platform - in actual fact i'm offering an analysis of the result from an electoral standpoint - whine about the electoral system if it makes you feel better but the system we have is the system we have and UKIP must play that game. 

The purpose of an election campaign is to convince voters to vote for you taking the euro election as a baseline UKIP actually lost votes, seats, and saw a 5% drop in national support. 

Bluster all you want but it is the truth - Farage screwed the pooch. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, obviously you won't accept any criticism of what you perceive to be a major victory and confirmation that your position is well supported and valid. But the electoral truth is somewhat different, UKIP could have scored up to 10 seats, should have in fact looking at the tabs on the exit polls. There were back channel discussions with the Tories on this basis alone.

UKIP left the election red-faced and more importantly powerless.

But when one of your [party's major donors levels](http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/politics/article4440215.ece) an accusation like that at the leader's closest aide and calls for Farage to [face a leadership election](http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/may/14/nigel-farage-facing-a-coup-over-ukip-leadership) because he fluffed the campaign, you would do better to listen rather than reject out of hand.

Edit: The paywalled Times interview above is the one in which Wheeler called the campaign a failure. Wheeler has donated close to 1 million to UKIP meaning he is solely responsible for 1/7th of the party's income since 2012. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Kassams detractors accused him of being a divisive Iago-type figure, dripping rightwing poison into Farages ear that harmed the partys chances of winning over moderate voters.

The accusation inside the party mostly exposed in the leadership contra temps post election was that Kassam pushed Farage too far to the right because he wanted a Tea Party Style campaign and this is what cost them the votes they needed to win seats.

Its been very easy for party supporters to blame the electoral system and focus on the national vote (UKIP after all loves grievance), but when you look at UKIP's performance during the campaign there is no doubt that the campaign cost UKIP votes - the polls show that.

UKIP lost a seat it had and should have won, failed in 9 other seats, lost 600k voters who were willing to vote UKIP (the hardest part is getting people to change their vote), and Carswell having received 59% of the vote in 2014 was elected with only 44%.

Thats the internal discussion inside the party - not the national performance, because the national performance doesn't matter in FPTP. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Indeed. I was mostly thinking back to the days when I lived on the Gorgie Road near Tynecastle stadium. Behaviour outside the grounds hasn't improved much though. </TEXT>
