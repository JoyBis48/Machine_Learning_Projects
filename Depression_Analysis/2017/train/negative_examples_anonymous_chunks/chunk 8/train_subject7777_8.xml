	<TEXT> This is silly, companies that make that much money on selling phones should just replace the device, and companies that make different voltage ratings for chargers on purpose are the ones spurring this problem in the first place IMO. USB connectors are supposed to be a standard, so if you're charging by a microUSB plug and it fries your device, it's because an engineer somewhere was more than likely TOLD to create a device with a different voltage rating SO that users would be punished for using 3rd party products.

I've got 5 useless data cables that don't work with my Samsung phone because they play games with pins and voltages just so you have to buy their specific cable even though it's billed as a USB connection. That's just bullshit. Industry Standard should mean Industry Standard. </TEXT>

Next time, however, knowing how pretty the adult form is, I will make a greater effort to remove it from my house to a safe location rather than summary execution.

I've seen them around before and generally left them be because of their demonic appearance hahaha - I just couldn't have him where he was - about to crawl up under my couch in the corner and possibly re-emerge at some random time. </TEXT>

I'll try the noopept sublingually, though I must admit - having seen a complainant about the taste of sulbutiamine below, which I don't mind the taste of - that I think noopept tastes like synthetic cat piss and despise the taste of it haha. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh thanks on that 5htp info.

Re: Noopept I disagree on the super stringent weight requirements. You take a double scoop of the 15 mg scoop they provide and it works wonders and I don't get side effects from it. I still cycle as directed.

Re: Sulbutiamine I agree on the use sparingly axiom. Every time I touch it I feel a good boost and then I leave it alone for weeks. Tolerance definitely was detected in early use. Now with occasional use I always feel a little boost and I feel on point.

But yes point taken on the 5-HTP. I'll back it off to a maintenance thing in case I roll, but I have noticed only long term effects from cessation like a dip in mood at the three week mark from stopping. Any comment on why it would take 3 weeks to do that? Generally while on it I do not notice any serious effect.

	<TEXT> I wake up in the morning and drink about a pint of coffee from a french press, drink a Bolthouse Arabica Coffee Protein 30g, and then I take

* MACA 500mg, Ginseng 200mg
* Gingko Biloba 120mg
* Noopept 2-3 scoops ~30-45mg
* Vitamin D^3 4000IUs
* Magnesium Citrate 400mg
* 5-HTP 50mg
* Every week or two I take a fingerprint of Sulbutiamine powder under the tongue and let stand til it absorbs halfway then rinse with water.
* Every week and a half or so I don't take the Noopept for a couple of days.

I've been doing this for the better part of a year now, never get muscle cramps, always remember stuff I swear I'd forget, even stoned, I wake up easily and I sleep easily. [male / 30] </TEXT>
