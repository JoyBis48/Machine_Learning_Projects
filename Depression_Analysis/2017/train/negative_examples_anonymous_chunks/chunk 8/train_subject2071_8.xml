	<TEXT> Thanks for this response I think I will apply in 3rd year for training contracts with my LPC funded. I had gotten so caught up in thinking about what I would do when I finished 3rd year that I had forgotten that I'd receive help applying etc in my third year.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks, did you get your LPC funded by a training contract? Is it common for it to be funded by the training contract?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's a lovely idea but I'm already sorted housing wise for next year and it sadly isn't practical for me to just hop countries for a year. 

Thanks for your reply though.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> (UK) Undergraduate Lawyer needs help </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-04-10 14:18:25 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm currently a second year law student plodding my way through my degree. 

I know that I want to do my Law Practicing Course (LPC) once I finish my three years and then move onto a training contract. But, I also want a year out to live in News Zealand. 

Would I be best having a year out and then do my LPC which would hopefully be funded through a training contract? Or would I be best doing my LPC straight away after these 3 years and then have a year out and then go onto a training contract? The downside to the latter is that I would have to fund the 10,000 LPC myself. 

How common is it that training contracts fund LPCs? 

Any help/comments/sharing of own experiences would be great.
