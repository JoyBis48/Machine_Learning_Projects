	<TEXT> "Hes not like Peter Quill. Theres not much humour, I think hes a little more John Wayne than Marty McFly. Hes deadly serious. There are comedic elements in the film, just not coming from my character."

Huh. I don't think I've ever seen Chris Pratt play a character like that. I obviously wasn't expecting a character as funny and wacky as Andy or Starlord, but I certainly wasn't expecting this. I'm interested to see how this goes.

Theres humour but then, from page 25 on, theres not that much to laugh about.

This is also interesting. I'm no expert, but that seems pretty early for things to go wrong. One of my favorite aspects about Jurassic Park was that we got through almost the entire first half of the movie with *pretty much* no dinosaurs or deaths, and I was really hoping to get a good long exploration of the new park and how it works and functions and people interacting with it and how the dinosaurs exist in the park before everything goes bad.

I really can't wait for a trailer because I still feel like I have no solid idea of what the general tone and direction of this movie will be. I'm excited. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Jeez that article took a damn long time to get to the point. Basically it's saying we should stop referring to the alien in the Alien franchise as a Xenomorph, since it isn't the real name of the alien, just a vague term they use to describe a life form they haven't documented yet. Well duh. Xenomorph sticks because it's the only name anyone ever gave it and it's better than the Alien alien.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I suck at math, but if you could guess roughly how many hours he spent running, and estimate what his average running speed would be (probably faster than an average man, maybe mid-tier athlete speed) then you could maybe work it out that way.

I haven't seen the movie in ages but didn't he run for pretty much a whole day straight from when he escaped from the city to where his wife was stranded back at their village, give or take a couple hours. 

I don't think there's any way at all to get a real answer but you could get a rough estimation. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> "It's BONKERS  weird, weird, weird," one person who saw the film told me. "It made me laugh out loud several times, but not in the ways you might expect. The humor is not so much 'Boogie Nights,' as I think a lot of people are expecting. For reals, it tips into, like, Zucker Bros.-level gags and broad humor."

PTA is one of my favorite directors working today, and I'm really looking forward to this film. But I really hope there's a trailer some time soon so I can figure out what the hell this movie is. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I haven't played GTA Online at all, I completed GTA 5 on Xbox and was waiting for Online to be working properly before I started playing again but I never did. But I'm still super keen to get GTA 5 when it releases on next gen systems. One of the things I'm really excited about is all the new awesome vehicles and weapons that have been released on GTA Online since launch. 

I was just wondering, will all these new updates be available for use in single player? Do all the new vehicles and weapons currently become available for purchase by Michael/Trevor/Franklin once you've installed the GTA Online updates?

Rockstar had this to say 

"All new content and gameplay created since the launch of Grand Theft Auto Online, including an extensive array of new Jobs, an arsenal of new weapons, scores of new vehicles, new properties and player customizations will also be available for the PlayStation 4 system, Xbox One and PC with much more to come. In addition, the current community of players will have the ability to transfer their Grand Theft Auto Online characters and progression to their choice of PlayStation 4, Xbox One or PC," 

So if we buy the game on a next gen system of some kind, will all these new things be available for purchase in single player from the start? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I love learning about classic films and discovering the cinema greats, but a lot of them are quite slow or uninteresting to friends and family, so I always have to watch them alone. 

What are some great classics that one could watch with friends and family that will still feel fun and fresh and aren't as 'dated' to people who aren't super into old films? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I know there's been a Vice City Stories and Liberty City Stories, and the GTA 4 dlc was Episodes from Liberty City, but had there been a Los Santos Stories?

If this does end up being a new game, and not just someone trademarking the name for whatever other reasons, I wonder if it'll be GTA 4 style dlc or a whole new game like the other City Stories games. Although the GTA 4 dlc was pretty much 2 whole new games anyway. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Animal Kingdom and Chopper are my favourites, and yes The Rover looks awesome. Dirty Deeds is a good funny crime movie, and Adventures of Priscilla Queen of the Desert is another great comedy. Gallipoli is great, and although I haven't seen it, I've heard nothing but good things about The Square. 

But really the most famous Australian classic that everyone loves is Mad Max </TEXT>
