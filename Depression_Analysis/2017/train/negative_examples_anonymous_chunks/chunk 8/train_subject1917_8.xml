	<TEXT> I agree! I believe when we build support for incremental bills like this we should always continue to inform people that the fight is not over. That this is not the cure. That there is still much to do. I just know once this bill gets passed you will hear things like, "They just passed that bill that requires the gov to have a warrant to collect your data. We won!" and that would be far from reality. So, when discussing bills like this we must fight for their passage but also press the fact that this is not over. We would still have many mtns to climb. Defense of the Constitution is a constant battle. Its under attack from all sides, every day.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree it would be a move in the right direction but would passing this bill close the door on discussions of the gov still collecting data? I am afraid people will take this bill as, "They no longer collect our data." Which would be false. This could lead to the discussion losing steam and nothing ever being done about the gov collection. They do not need company DBs to collect your data. So, what is stopping that? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Reps. Ted Poe (R-TX, 2nd), Zoe Lofgren (D-CA, 19th), and Thomas Massie (R-KY, 4th) said in a statement Wednesday that the bill -- the End Warrantless Surveillance of Americans Act -- would force the government to get a warrant before it can access **databases** containing American data.

This statement worries me. Does this mean they can still collect the data but can only access it if they have a warrant? That would still mean there are large DBs with all of your communications stored in them. How would this DB be protected? What kind of safeguards would be in place to prevent malicious intent? 

I would prefer them not to store any data on Americans unless a warrant has been issued.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  "One way or the other, we are determined to deny Iraq the capacity to develop weapons of mass destruction and the missiles to deliver them. That is our bottom line." - President Clinton, Feb. 4, 1998.    

 "If Saddam rejects peace and we have to use force, our purpose is clear. We want to seriously diminish the threat posed by Iraq's weapons of mass destruction program." - President Clinton, Feb. 17, 1998.    

 "Iraq is a long way from [here], but what happens there matters a great deal here. For the risks that the leaders of a rogue state will use nuclear, chemical or biological weapons against us or our allies is the greatest security threat we face." - Madeline Albright, Feb 18, 1998.    

 "He will use those weapons of mass destruction again, as he has ten times since 1983." - Sandy Berger, Clinton National Security Adviser, Feb, 18, 1998    

 "[W]e urge you, after consulting with Congress, and consistent with the U.S. Constitution and laws, to take necessary actions (including, if appropriate, air and missile strikes on suspect Iraqi sites) to respond effectively to the threat posed by Iraq's refusal to end its weapons of mass destruction programs." - Letter to President Clinton, signed by Sens. Carl Levin, Tom Daschle, John Kerry, and others Oct. 9, 1998.    

 "Saddam Hussein has been engaged in the development of weapons of mass destruction technology which is a threat to countries in the region and he has made a mockery of the weapons inspection process." - Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D, CA), Dec. 16, 1998.    

 "Hussein has ... chosen to spend his money on building weapons of mass destruction and palaces for his cronies." - Madeline Albright, Clinton Secretary of State, Nov. 10, 1999.    

 "There is no doubt that . Saddam Hussein has reinvigorated his weapons programs. Reports indicate that biological, chemical and nuclear programs continue apace and may be back to pre-Gulf War status. In addition, Saddam continues to redefine delivery systems and is doubtless using the cover of a licit missile program to develop longer-range missiles that will threaten the United States and our allies." - Letter to President Bush, Signed by Sen. Bob Graham (D, FL,) and others, Dec, 5, 2001.    

 "We begin with the common belief that Saddam Hussein is a tyrant and a threat to the peace and stability of the region. He has ignored the mandate of the United Nations and is building weapons of mass destruction and the means of delivering them." - Sen. Carl Levin (d, MI), Sept. 19, 2002.    

 "We know that he has stored secret supplies of biological and chemical weapons throughout his country. Iraq's search for weapons of mass destruction has proven impossible to deter and we should assume that it will continue for as long as Saddam is in power." - Al Gore, Sept. 23, 2002.    

 "We have known for many years that Saddam Hussein is using and developing weapons of mass destruction." - Sen. Ted Kennedy (D, MA), Sept. 27, 2002.    

 "The last UN weapons inspectors left Iraq in October 1998. We are confident that Saddam Hussein retains some stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons, and that he has since embarked on a crash course to build up his chemical and biological warfare capabilities. Intelligence reports indicate that he is seeking nuclear weapons." - Sen. Robert Byrd (D, WV), Oct. 3, 2002.    

 "I will be voting to give the President of the United States the authority to use force  if necessary  to disarm Saddam Hussein because I believe that a deadly arsenal of weapons of mass destruction in his hands is a real and grave threat to our security." - Sen. John F. Kerry (D, MA), Oct. 9, 2002.    

 "There is unmistakable evidence that Saddam Hussein is working aggressively to develop nuclear weapons and will likely have nuclear weapons within the next five years . We also should remember we have alway s underestimated the progress Saddam has made in development of weapons of mass destruction." - Sen. Jay Rockerfeller (D, WV), Oct 10, 2002    

 "He has systematically violated, over the course of the past 11 years, every significant UN resolution that has demanded that he disarm and destroy his chemical and biological weapons, and any nuclear capacity. This he has refused to do." - Rep. Henry Waxman (D, CA), Oct. 10, 2002.    

 "In the four years since the inspectors left, intelligence reports show that Saddam Hussein has worked to rebuild his chemical and biological weapons stock, his missile delivery capability, and his nuclear program. He has also given aid, comfort, and sanctuary to terrorists, including al Qaeda members. It is clear, however, that if left unchecked, Saddam Hussein will continue to increase his capacity to wage biological and chemical warfare, and will keep trying to develop nuclear weapons." - Sen. Hillary Clinton (D, NY), Oct 10, 2002    

 "We are in possession of what I think to be compelling evidence that Saddam Hussein has, and has had for a number of years, a developing capacity for the production and storage of weapons of mass destruction. "[W]ithout question, we need to disarm Saddam Hussein. He is a brutal, murderous dictator, leading an oppressive regime ... He presents a particularly grievous threat because he is so consistently prone to miscalculation. And now he has continued deceit and his consistent grasp for weapons of mass destruction ... So the threat of Saddam Hussein with weapons of mass destruction is real." - Sen. John F. Kerry (D, MA), Jan. 23. 2003.     </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Boot the computer and when you see the Dell splash/bios screen immediately start pressing Ctrl+F11.

So, I am assuming that this disc from your friend was not a Dell OEM disk. Probably a retail copy.

Is there a Windows license sticker on the bottom of your laptop? Check under the battery, as well. Key retrievers will not give you the correct key on OEM installs, FME. Try to find that license sticker. If you find the correct key we may be able to use the retail copy of the DVD.

Try calling Dell support and requesting a reinstallation DVD. They *were* allowing 1 per customer but I am not sure how old your system is or if they are still doing this for Win7 machines.

If Dell will not ship you the DVD try locating a Dell Windows 7 Home Premium 64bit DVD. Ask your friends and family. If you can get your hands on this DVD it *should not* ask you for a key. </TEXT>

What version of Windows is your product key for?    

How did you restore it? What procedure did you use?

	<TEXT> haha, I have never met a Christian that has said anything of the sort. Not saying they do not exist but I live in the bible belt. Grew up southern baptist. The major reason I see or hear is confusion. Older people like things simple. On one side you have people saying its bad for you. On the other side its the cure for all things. Then you have the government that classifies it as harmful as heroin. Now you have to understand that majority of these elderly people have probably never tried marijuana. They only know that the US government says its as bad as heroin and that the news tells them that people who smoke pot are potheads and lazy. These elderly probably grew up during the aftermath of the Reefer Madness days. Then you had the 60s anti war demonstrators and the hippies who were portrayed as anarchists, murders, soldier haters. etc. In my experience, religion is the least reason people in the bible belt are anti legalization. With all that said, where do the majority of elderly retire? The south....the Bible belt. So its a catch all for the elderly who in turn has anti marijuana views because of the way its been portrayed to them the last 70-80 years. Some people will vote against on religious grounds. The majority? Not so much.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Lets take a look at the rhetoric before the Iraq war, shall we?    

 "One way or the other, we are determined to deny Iraq the capacity to develop weapons of mass destruction and the missiles to deliver them. That is our bottom line." - President Clinton, Feb. 4, 1998.    

 "If Saddam rejects peace and we have to use force, our purpose is clear. We want to seriously diminish the threat posed by Iraq's weapons of mass destruction program." - President Clinton, Feb. 17, 1998.    

 "Iraq is a long way from [here], but what happens there matters a great deal here. For the risks that the leaders of a rogue state will use nuclear, chemical or biological weapons against us or our allies is the greatest security threat we face." - Madeline Albright, Feb 18, 1998.    

 "He will use those weapons of mass destruction again, as he has ten times since 1983." - Sandy Berger, Clinton National Security Adviser, Feb, 18, 1998    

 "[W]e urge you, after consulting with Congress, and consistent with the U.S. Constitution and laws, to take necessary actions (including, if appropriate, air and missile strikes on suspect Iraqi sites) to respond effectively to the threat posed by Iraq's refusal to end its weapons of mass destruction programs." - Letter to President Clinton, signed by Sens. Carl Levin, Tom Daschle, John Kerry, and others Oct. 9, 1998.    

 "Saddam Hussein has been engaged in the development of weapons of mass destruction technology which is a threat to countries in the region and he has made a mockery of the weapons inspection process." - Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D, CA), Dec. 16, 1998.    

 "Hussein has ... chosen to spend his money on building weapons of mass destruction and palaces for his cronies." - Madeline Albright, Clinton Secretary of State, Nov. 10, 1999.    

 "There is no doubt that . Saddam Hussein has reinvigorated his weapons programs. Reports indicate that biological, chemical and nuclear programs continue apace and may be back to pre-Gulf War status. In addition, Saddam continues to redefine delivery systems and is doubtless using the cover of a licit missile program to develop longer-range missiles that will threaten the United States and our allies." - Letter to President Bush, Signed by Sen. Bob Graham (D, FL,) and others, Dec, 5, 2001.    

 "We begin with the common belief that Saddam Hussein is a tyrant and a threat to the peace and stability of the region. He has ignored the mandate of the United Nations and is building weapons of mass destruction and the means of delivering them." - Sen. Carl Levin (d, MI), Sept. 19, 2002.    

 "We know that he has stored secret supplies of biological and chemical weapons throughout his country. Iraq's search for weapons of mass destruction has proven impossible to deter and we should assume that it will continue for as long as Saddam is in power." - Al Gore, Sept. 23, 2002.    

 "We have known for many years that Saddam Hussein is useing and developing weapons of mass destruction." - Sen. Ted Kennedy (D, MA), Sept. 27, 2002.    

 "The last UN weapons inspectors left Iraq in October1998. We are confident that Saddam Hussein retains some stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons, and that he has since embarked on a crash course to build up his chemical and biological warfare capabilities. Intelligence reports indicate that he is seeking nuclear weapons." - Sen. Robert Byrd (D, WV), Oct. 3, 2002.    

 "I will be voting to give the President of the United States the authority to use force  if necessary  to disarm Saddam Hussein because I believe that a deadly arsenal of weapons of mass destruction in his hands is a real and grave threat to our security." - Sen. John F. Kerry (D, MA), Oct. 9, 2002.    

 "There is unmistakable evidence that Saddam Hussein is working aggressively to develop nuclear weapons and will likely have nuclear weapons within the next five years . We also should remember we have alway s underestimated the progress Saddam has made in development of weapons of mass destruction." - Sen. Jay Rockerfeller (D, WV), Oct 10, 2002    

 "He has systematically violated, over the course of the past 11 years, every significant UN resolution that has demanded that he disarm and destroy his chemical and biological weapons, and any nuclear capacity. This he has refused to do." - Rep. Henry Waxman (D, CA), Oct. 10, 2002.    

 "In the four years since the inspectors left, intelligence reports show that Saddam Hussein has worked to rebuild his chemical and biological weapons stock, his missile delivery capability, and his nuclear program. He has also given aid, comfort, and sanctuary to terrorists, including al Qaeda members. It is clear, however, that if left unchecked, Saddam Hussein will continue to increase his capacity to wage biological and chemical warfare, and will keep trying to develop nuclear weapons." - Sen. Hillary Clinton (D, NY), Oct 10, 2002    

 "We are in possession of what I think to be compelling evidence that Saddam Hussein has, and has had for a number of years, a developing capacity for the production and storage of weapons of mass destruction. "[W]ithout question, we need to disarm Saddam Hussein. He is a brutal, murderous dictator, leading an oppressive regime ... He presents a particularly grievous threat because he is so consistently prone to miscalculation. And now he has continued deceit and his consistent grasp for weapons of mass destruction ... So the threat of Saddam Hussein with weapons of mass destruction is real." - Sen. John F. Kerry (D, MA), Jan. 23. 2003.     </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, Britain was obligated to defend neutral Belgium by the terms of a 75-year old treaty in WW1. The US had no obligation. Probably should have tried a little harder to keep your region in-check. Britain, well Europe in general, always seems to wait until it hits the fan to actually do anything and when they finally do something its sub-par at best. Look at the Balkans in the 90s. Europe sat around while millions of people died. Who finally did something about it? The US Military. </TEXT>
