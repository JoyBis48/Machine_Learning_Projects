The main services have that feel good, be rewarded, yada yada yada tone, but I've gotten the impression that the bible studies and other small group things at Lakewood do have a more evangelical tone to them. I knew a guy who started going there, became an usher, started going to bible study for men classes and turned into one of those guys who, like Orthodox Jews and extremist Muslims, got mad at women for not dressing modestly, it was their fault for tempting him. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I call it a quirk, because I spent a few years living and practicing law in Wisconsin where there are limitations/requirements concerning what specific county can issue your marriage license. For example, if I'm a resident of Wisconsin and I want to get a marriage license from Milwaukee County, I or my fianc had to live in Milwaukee County for at least 30 days. People who don't live in Wisconsin but want to get married there, say in Bayfield (which is very lovely during summer) have to get their marriage license from Bayfield County. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Each state has its own laws regarding marriage (heavily tied to property law), but, states cannot enact and enforce laws that violate the Constitution. The marriage issue isn't new territory for the Supreme Court, in 1967 the Court issued a decision in Loving v. Virginia stating that state laws prohibiting interracial marriage were unconstitutional.
I haven't read the full majority Opinion, so don't know if this was an issue in the outcome, but one major problem I have had with state laws that ban same sex marriage is that they also said the state did not have to recognize such a marriage that took place in a state where same sex marriage was legal. To me this goes completely against full faith and credit, which I view as a building block of our legal system. </TEXT>

(Just as an interesting aside, there is a quirk in Texas law that allows you to get a marriage license from a county that you don't live in nor do you plan to marry in. I have friends who live in Harris but got their licenses in Fort Bend because it is a "prettier" looking license.) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The Cherry Sisters were a Vaudeville act, consisting of real life sisters, who performed music, poetry, readings, fake hypnosis, and other artistic expressions. Audiences found the group devoid of talent and would yell at group and throw fruit and vegetables at the Cherry Sisters during their performances, and yet the group continued to tour and perform. Were they precursors to comedians like Andy Kaufman or were they really talentless? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I doubt he'll say anything during the service, the few times I went to Lakewood with my now ex-wife Joel never seemed to get into controversial topics, sticked to his normal be positive themes. Though this post reminded me of a discussion I had with a gay friend who was looking for a Houston church to attend, he didn't like Lakewood because there wasn't enough "fire and brimstone" in its message.

	<TEXT> I agree with you, those still fighting same sex marriage are on the wrong side of history. But it is good that their efforts to fight against what is right are futile because there are counties in Texas issuing licenses to same sex couples, and you can get a license from a county even if you don't live in the county and you don't plan to get married in that county. </TEXT>
