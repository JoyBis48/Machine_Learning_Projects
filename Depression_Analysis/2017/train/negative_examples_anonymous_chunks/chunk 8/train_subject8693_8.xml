	<TEXT> I'm not sure who he is, but I'm fairly certain I know how he died. I believe the woman who came forward in 2002 was telling the truth. That her mother bought the boy, and he was kept in the house, sexually and physically abused. She claims she was with her mother when the body was dumped, and details from her story match other confidential testimony. The reason no one puts much stock into her confession is because she's mentally ill. That just strengthens it in my mind though. If she was in a bad situation at home where horrors like that we're occurring, it would have undoubtedly messed with her mind. Coupling that with the time period, psychiatry being looked down on in general, and women being expected to be perfect, prim, and proper. Her mental illness became exponentially worse, making people think she's just another lunatic. </TEXT>

This concerns the right side of my jaw. For years its made a clicking sound when I eat certain things, like tootsie rolls and stuff like that. When I was younger I could kind of move my lower jaw to the right and I could make the sound at will. I haven't done that in years but I've noticed from time to time it feels like the right side of my jaw is going to lock up. It's uncomfortable and lately it has been feeling more uncomfortable, to the point I'm careful when I eat because it feels like going to fast or anything might cause it to lock up. </TEXT>
