They are mean mothers all right! 

I remember when I was a kid and we were living in the burbs of Chicago. One night, I went to let our dogs in to the house from their pen when they tore off to the back of the yard and cornered one. Fortunately, my mom heard the commotion, and when she yelled at the pups, they ran back towards the house. 

I'll never forget those glowing, beady eyes and that hissing sound. 

Course, I was a little guy, but it sure seemed big. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  The article alludes to no attempt on behalf of the researches to carefully identify counties with similar demographics to those where fracking takes place as their control group.

I'm looking forward to seeing what comes from this. </TEXT>
