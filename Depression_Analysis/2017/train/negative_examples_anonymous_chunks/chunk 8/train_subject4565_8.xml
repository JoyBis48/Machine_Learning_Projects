This Bond was a straight-up cold blooded motherf---er who could feed a dude to sharks, burn a man to death and doom Benicio del Toro to being *literally ground to a pulp*, then go for a romantic dip with his lady. Bond to both extremes. Maybe not what most would want, but it's enjoyable to watch. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Inhumans is IMO the most likely.    
    
Ant-Man? No. Civil War? Of course not. Benedoctor Cumberstrange? No. Guardians 2? Never. New Spider-Man? Slightly more likely, but not very. Thor 3? Loki's in it, so no. Infinity War Pt.1? Never. Black Panther? He'll already be an Avenger, so no. Captain Marvel? I'm going to say no. Infinity War Pt 2? Never in a million years.

	<TEXT> In the SchmoesKnow review, Kristian said he enjoyed it even more the second time and gave it a better rating than he did in this video.    
Better the second time?! That's a good sign. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm the same - the concept of a larger film universe excites me, but the first film wasn't much more than a fun playful romp. The dramatic tone from the promos makes it look tense as *** - that's what I'm pumped for. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Mostly positive. Kristian gave it 4.2/5, Mark gave it 4.75/5.     
Their main gripes are the strange "Russian" accents and apparently not much of a lead-up to Civil War.    
Let's keep the hype train going! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Lost. Despite anything you may say about how well it wrapped up, it's so goddamn complex. Characters show up in several people's flashbacks, sometimes super ambiguously. Locke v Ben, Locke v Jack, Jack v Christian etc. are great conflicts. Questions of right v wrong, power dynamics, vengeance, and the boundaries of redemption, are constantly brought up.    
What starts off as a thriller about a plane crash becomes philosophical as hell.    
Sure, the sci-fi/fantasy elements don't tie together well at the end, but 85+% of the show is spent developing and utilising its characters. Their story is tied up well. In those terms, the show is brilliant.    
    
The real reason the show is talked down upon is because you can't debate or podcast as well about character as you can about the various mysteries - this aspect of the show was severely overhyped, and still is in terms of the show's overall "disappointment factor" in a sense. If that's all you focus on you're bound to be disappointed, but there's much more to this show than that. </TEXT>
