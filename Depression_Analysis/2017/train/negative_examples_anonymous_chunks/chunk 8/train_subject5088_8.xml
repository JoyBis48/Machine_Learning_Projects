Things that were especially outstanding in tonight's episode: 

* The lighting - everything from the soft light of the windows and candles to the contrast of light and shadow on people's faces to the low, dim lighting of the last scene was outstanding.  
* The use of symmetry - full throttle in this episode. 
* Framing Will in tight, confined shots, lines, and spaces to convey a sense that he is trapped by Hannibal's designs.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think it was for that last line about Hannibal being lonely and wishing it was Will Graham dining with him. It further helps the viewer understand how much Hannibal wanted Will's friendship and how much it cut him when he was betrayed. It also leads up to the Hannibal broken heart scene at the very end of the episode.  </TEXT>

Calling him an animal, eating him, feeding him to himself, and basically all around tormenting him with the fact that he's going to kill him slowly and horribly... and then Gideon turns it all around on Hannibal with one line. And Hannibal's just like goddamnit.  </TEXT>

I also basically just did a detailed rewatch of this episode while taking these screenshots. So many more beautiful scenes, but even after I trimmed it down I had so many images.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In no particular order: 

* Fantastic acting   casting, particularly for Mads Mikkelsen as Hannibal and Hugh Dancy as Will 
* Beautiful cinematography
* Amazing art direction (and creativity around the murder tableaus)
* Best sound and music I've heard on a TV show ever - eerie and atmospheric
* Dark, gothic sets and costumes (especially the color palettes) 
* Bryan Fuller
* Well written and well paced

Also because: 

* The exploration of the friendship between Hannibal and Will 
* The exploration of the pathological psyche of Will Graham and the killers he pursues 
* It's not afraid to push the boundaries of art, graphic violence, and dark stories on network television  </TEXT>
