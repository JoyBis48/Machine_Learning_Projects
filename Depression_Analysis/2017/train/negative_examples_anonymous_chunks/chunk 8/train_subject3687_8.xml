	<TEXT> I have PCOS and dark chin hairs which I have to shave daily. My mother has to do the same thing.  I used to pluck them but then my hormones got really messed up and now I have to shave in addition to taking birth control and spironolactone since I have an excess of testosterone.

I bought a tria laser system and it doesn't appear to be doing anything since I still have to shave daily.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have seasonal affective disorder, it's very bleak in winter and I get horribly depressed. It's finally spring so I have been sunning myself in moderation with adequate sunscreen on. In the winter months I have a UV light that helps, especially when it's dark out when I go to work and dark when I come back home, sometimes it feels like I never see the sun. I live in Pennsylvania but ideally would prefer to live in Florida or the southwest where it is usually 60 degrees year round. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Also I would have to go outside to use the ecig anyway because our district manager made it clear we were NOT allowed to vape in the store so it was just easier to go bum a cigarette.  There are many cities making it illegal so you're damned if you do and damned if you don't. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I tried e-cigs for 6 months. I quit smoking and it was awesome but then I got a job and didn't have time to sit around waiting for batteries to charge and everyone at work smoked so I went back to smoking, for almost a year now.
