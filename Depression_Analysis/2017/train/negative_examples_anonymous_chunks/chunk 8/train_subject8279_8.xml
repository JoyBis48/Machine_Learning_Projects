	<TEXT> This stuff happens. It's called growing Pains. Without these lessons we can't learn.  They have to happen to weed out the bad players and groom the upcoming good ones. This is a professional basketball team. That means that there are other teams just as hungry as we are that have gone through the same thing and are finally making it to the top  (hawks, grizz, warriors, etc). It takes years to make it,  some teams don't even make it.  Let's appreciate we at least have a classy organization that prides itself on winning and resiliency. We were a 15 win season not to long ago then won a couple titles afterwards. Our job is to support our team despite the record.  Period.  </TEXT>
