	<TEXT> One 4" hotel pan is approx enough of one side (rice, veg, etc) for 40-50 peeps.  As far as the rice goes, if you can do it and your clients are happy with it, do it.  I personally have reservations as to consistency of quality.  But it is territory that I've had little experience with.

Prices are market price, or a static menu.  When it comes to catering, it is all a job by job contract as nobody wants the same thing.  $16/per head rates are low.  I was charging that in 2000.  Have you looked into what your competition charges?  Are they providing it all?  Plates, flatware, delivery, etc?  Will you be doing the same?  Or will you be showing up with a trailer, cambros, paper plates, and wet-naps?

Don't shoot yourself in the foot by undercutting competition to much.  You don't want to beat them in price, but in quality, service, and product.  Remember, once you establish your cheap rate, people will expect it and complain if they don't get it.  The minimum I charge is $20/person for a non-plated affair.  If you want plates, it jumps to at least $30/person.

Kebabs are not meatballs.  Just FYI.  Kebabs are a single piece of muscle cut to size.  I assumed smoking VS grilling for those, but the pain in the ass that I mention is the mixing, cutting, and forming.  They look great, people love them, and they are cost effective.  However, I would much rather spend another $30-50 in product cost if it saves me 2 hours worth of work.  As long as I can make a product that is just as good.  IMO, my labor in the kitchen should be yielding $75-100 profit per hour.  The whole point of the Q is to do food in batch, not single serving.  Every time your hands touch the meat, you should be touching 20 portions.  Not one.  Touching one is a waste of time.  Kebabs will kill you in the long run.

You want to do Turkish Q and keep it unique?  Go with goat and lamb.  If you must do chicken, sluvakis are the shit and are easy to set up a public friendly "sandwich making station".

Now, goat and lamb are not cheap.  Well, goat is cheapish.  And many would say it isn't worth it.  Fuck that.  If you want authentic, good, different, and to stand out, you must.  Just remember, you already said the golden ticket to offset the cost - hummus.  Keep your sides in check on the cost and that will balance the expensive protein.

Olives.  Buy olives in bulk.  I mean, for real.  I'm talking about 15 gallon containers of Kalamata in bulk.  Yes, storage sucks. But if you have proper storage, olives keep forever and are CHEAP.  Tapenade is a great side, fast to make with a processer, and people love it.  Something else you can do on the smoke is "oil cured and smoked citrus olives with rosemary and saffron."  Great side and perfect app finger food.

Baklava.  Learn how to make that stuff well.  Don't buy it, the difference is huge.  I can make about 150 pieces in an hour and I'm fast.  It is time consuming, but oh so worth it.  People notice and will talk about it if it is good. If you want a crash course, I'll tell you to talk to me after you've figured out how to run melted butted through a spray bottle.  That isn't snark BTW, but seriousness.

Ok.  That's enough for now!  More questions? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Some of us around here are professional restaurant people.  If you have what you consider to be a solid menu, post it up.  That is one way that we can be of real use to you.

Do not, I repeat DO NOT do weddings as a BBQ outfit.  It is a disaster waiting to happen.  Been there, done that.  Not only are weddings a fucking nightmare, if anything goes wrong, it is the end of the world.  And if cousin Jimmy's little shit of a kid can't keep his hands and the Q sauce to himself, there are some seriously pissed off bridesmaids in ruined dresses.  Just pause and think about the wedding fiasco for a minute...

Smoked rice is a terrible idea.  Sounds great, but it will be dry.  Sure sure, in the backyard you might get it to come out just fine.  Different story when you're talking in batch and you don't have another 90 minutes to whip up a new pan of rice.  If you want to run rice in the hot chamber, do a plastic and foil wrap on the pan for a steam catch.

Kabaabs are a lot of work.  A lot of work.  Especially when you start talking about needing 300 portions worth.  Plus you have to soak skewers and you run the risk of charred wood in your food.  Then you have to think about the ease of people eating it on the plate.  #1 rule in the restaurant kitchen when it leaves the line window destined for the customer is "Nothing on the plate that you wouldn't want to eat.  Period."  No ramekin of sauce, no fucking bay leaf, and no skewers.  I would suggest figuring out a different way to control portion than with skewers.

I got plenty of thoughts for ya.  If you have real questions, ask away.  And take to heart what 3rdIQ said too.  Good stuff. </TEXT>

Also, there are some known historical burn areas in the Clallam area, as well as around Lake Chelan.  Discovery park in Seattle is also known as a hotbed of Morels since the burn in the late 70's.

	<TEXT> Yeah, I've heard all that before.  Now let's get into science.  The reason bacon is so delicious is because of the fat.  When you submerge the bacon in hot oil, all the fat leeches out.  When you use a flat or a pan, it cooks in its own juice.  Deep fried bacon is essiently carbon :(

I have never, in my professional cooking career spanning continents and years, encountered a kitchen that thought it was ok to deep fry bacon.  In fact, that is a dumbass offense and one warning.  IMO, basically a fireable offense for making shitty product to sell to customers.  You wanna know how to kill your business?  Deep fry bacon. </TEXT>

How much per order in customer cost and how much on the plate?

	<TEXT> Here is how. And perfect every time. Honest.

Cut the ends off.  Salt liberally both sides.  No oil.  Place in a deep pan so they are under the lip.  Wrap the pan tight with plastic wrap.  Then with foil.  Yes.  If you don't know this trick, it will change your life.  About an hou and a half or until beets are fork tender.  350f.  

Now the hard part.  While the beets are piping hot, take a wet towel and wipe the peel off.  Yep.  That simple.  Just wipe em off.  They are just hot and red beets bleed dye EVERYWHERE.  Then you should have beets cooked to about 90% doneness to finish however you like. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Dust VS Powder VS Seasoning IMO

Dust - non-salted mixed spice seasoning, fine powder with no granulation.

Powder - a single spice, partially granulated.

Seasoning - several spices mixed with salt, partially granulated.

There are applications for each.

And in all honesty, I would rather just drop a plate in front of you and say "eat your fucking snack" and walk away.  But the internet demands one be nice and for some reason identify EVERY. FUCKING. THING. on the plate.  It honestly annoys me to no end and if anyone asked in real life what that was, I would say B G with eggs and pot. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I used to drink a lot of soda.  Then I realized I drank way to much.  After a while, I realized it was the carbonation that my body craved, not the caffeine or sugar.  So I started buying bubble water.

One of the best gifts that has ever been given to me was from an ex GF.  My Sodastream machine.  I only use it to carbonate water.  However, it is a godsend.  I was going through cases of bottled water like I would soda.  For me, the inconvenience of having to replace gas cans and the initial cost of the device is worth it.  Less packaging going to waste for one, but a can of gas carbonates about 2.5 times the amount of water you would pay for at the store.  

Just something to think about if you don't own one.  Especially if you opt for the soda and lime out at the bar/restaurant instead of a coke ;) </TEXT>

Wild boar.  Not bad, had not done that one yet.  Funny enough, I was just talking about wild boar sugo with an Italian cook friend.  I'll mention this one.  If you ever have a chance to get your hands on some 'gator bfast sausage, that is the fucking shit when it comes to B G IMO. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In that case, something else you can try is doing butter infusions to make your roux.  Notice i said infusions and not compounds.  The difference being is that with compounds you leave solids behind in the fat which can burn and ruin the sauce.  An infusion is essentially steeping dried(!) spice in butter and then straining it off.  Clarifying it at the same time.

If you build a roux using an infused butter with (fennel, rosemary, hot chile flakes, black pepper, and sage) whatever, you can make a good enough gravy without the meat which people love too. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would say yes.  My basic recipe is 2 cups flour, 1/2 cup diced and frozen overnight butter, 1 tsp salt, 4 tsp baking powder, 1/4 tsp baking soda, and 1 cup liquid (this time it was cultured goat buttermilk).  Mixed with the lightest hand possible and let rest for 30 min.  Brush with wash and crack pepper over top  450F for about 20 min, till golden.  

To me it is a scone mix, but without the sugar. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah. I could just see you licking your finger and taking a taste.  Been there, done that.  One of the better applications for the SG is savory, rather than sweet.  FYI if you don't know. 

That little box is strong and powerful stuff.  If you add 1 tsp SG to 1 cup of any other spice seasoning mix, you'll see a difference.  I also like grinding it into the salt I keep on hand for French fries. </TEXT>

Maybe it was delicious, I dunno.  To each their own when it comes to making your own snacks.  WQould you make it again with the shrooms?

It looks like it would withstand the one handed sandwich test, which most pulled pork does not.  So very nice. </TEXT>
