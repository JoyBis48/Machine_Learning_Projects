	<TEXT> Me and a friend got fucked up after dipping our blunt in liquid codeine and decided to try finding a genre porn that doesn't exist. We searched everything. For example, here were some of our discoveries.

The following exist:
-Almost any childhood cartoon you can think of has a porn spinoff
-Amputee porn
-Puke porn
-Poop porn (disturbingly common)
-Actual Donkey punching

However we did not find anything in the area of mental disability porn... so yeah, i suppose the only way to win that game was to end up on something that doesn't exist because it's a shameful thought in the first place.

Amputee porn made my dick twitch </TEXT>
