	<TEXT> Z3+/Z4 should've never existed (in the sense that this Z5 should've been the Z4. Sony shouldn't be launching mid-generation "flagship" devices with the main change being that it has a newer version of Android, which just means it will stop supporting the previous flagship faster). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What about using Microsoft's Passport tech (which apparently is being standardized for FIDO 2.0), which authenticates the user locally, and then authenticates him with a service, without that service getting any real information, like his password or whatever:

	<TEXT> Indeed. Denver would've been more interesting for emulating games with its significantly higher single-threaded performance, but it seems Nvidia has just scrapped it due to its poor choky multi-tasking performance. 

I think Nvidia should try again to make its own core, but this time forego the in-order "software-based" design and instead do a regular 7-way out-out-order core with a low clock speed and on whatever  smallest process node is out there (Nvidia keeps using older process nodes in their chips when they launch them, which is unfortunate).

Even continuing to use ARM's cores (A72) with its own GPU, but using the latest node and without exaggerating with the CPU's clock speed, Nvidia could still show a nice chip for mobile. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hybrids will be about as successful as "hybrid PCs" - jack of all trades, master of none (yet still expensive).

Hybrids can't focus on maximum battery efficiency because they have to hold a whole other system in there (gas-powered one). Plus, you still have to do all the same maintenance as you do for a regular car. If you don't want a tiny battery (which is what all hybrids have) then it will cost you much more to buy and own a hybrid than a full EV in the same range. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Obviously there are some real transition pains to consider, but I believe ultimately they are a small price to pay when a country's institutions can use its own open source distro along with open source software and taxpayers money are used in an open way instead of filling American corporations' pockets by paying for software which could even be backdoored.

But other than that, I also believe Microsoft is a big obstacle in countries adopting Linux, both directly (heavy lobbying against it), but also indirectly (not giving OEMs a choice but to use Windows in most markets, and even if they want to use an open source solution, Microsoft might ask them to pay a fee anyway - patents, etc). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Unlike Sanders or Paul, Obama actually voted for the Patriot Act extension *before the general election* happened (as a Senator). Sanders and Paul have always voted against this sort of stuff.

Lesson here: vote based on their *track record* not on what they're saying alone (cough Clinton cough). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, and Model 3 should have at least 200 miles, too, although I think initial rumors put it at 250 miles, but that may not be accurate.

Also, I think Tesla's official numbers may be more accurate, kind of how Apple's battery life numbers are (or at least were in Steve Jobs' days, now I think Tim Cook has started exaggerating a bit, or at least mentions the light usage as if it were moderate usage) more accurate than most laptop manufacturers' numbers, which tended to claim battery life numbers that were about 2x what you'd get in the real world (remember those 8h battery life claims with 6-cells in 2009 or so? Never true).

For instance, I saw a recent review of the Renault ZOE, and they said it has a 130 mile range, yet the reviewer put it more at like 80 miles (~130 KM, which is about 40% less).

So unless proven otherwise, I'd much rather trust Tesla's "200 mile range" claims than other car manufacturers' "200 mile range" claims. 

Also, although not a foolproof way to verifty, checking the battery size should give a good idea of the range, too. For instance if Tesla will use a 60 kWh battery to achieve that 200 mile range claim, but VW will use a 40 kWh one, then it will be a lot more clear who's telling the truth. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well no. The CAFC ruled that APIs can be copyrighted. The Supreme Court stayed the ruling.

HOWEVER, Google's case *per se* was sent to a lower Court to see if Google's "violation" was actually covered under fair use. But even if Google wins that one, APIs still remain copyrightable as per the last CAFC ruling.

tl;dr Google still has a chance to win the case, but the software industry is *already* screwed (unless the 9th Circuit Court overturns the CAFC ruling, but seems unlikely). </TEXT>

Oh, and the NSA, or Russia, or China, or your local drug cartel could probably hack into your self-driving car and kill you while you drive 80mph on the highway.

It doesn't matter if it's "just an algorithm". That data will be stored on Google's servers so either hackers or abusive governments around the world can get that data.

You know how the OPM hacked happened? That could happen to Google, too (and in fact it *has happened* - [NSA hacked Google](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-24751821)). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Interesting, but "Google Now on tap" will still be able to see all the data within all Android apps on M, *unless* developers "opt-out" of that. 

I believe they are able to do that by *reading what's on the screen* in those apps (or perhaps in RAM), therefore bypassing any transport encryption that app may have. 

I think it's a very unfortunate thing for Google to do, especially when the default is *opt-out*, which probably means 90% of the developers won't even be aware this exists, let alone knowing how to disable it to protect their users' privacy.

	<TEXT> It doesn't though. Look at Youtube and others. They may have the same width, but not the same height. The only way to fix this is to put a fixed background shape behind all of them, like Apple does it (and many Android themes/icon packs do too). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The new clock icon is by far the most annoying. So tiny compared to the rest.

By the way, I agree that iOS does it better and it looks much more elegant to have them *look* the same size, but the way iOS does that is by having a "background" of the same size for all icons. 

Check the Chrome icon in that example. It has a background on it, which makes it *look* the same size as all the other icons, but it's not.

Personally, I wish Google adopted the same idea, too, because Android icons look "too messy". </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I wish Google would also allow users to create a "new account", like you can do now in Lollipop, but one that is completely isolated from your normal account and has "root" privileges. Kind of how Windows has Administrator and Standard accounts. 

Android accounts are by default "Standard" for security purposes - and that's great - but they should allow power users to have extra privileges on their phones, too, without having to resort to exploits in software. </TEXT>
