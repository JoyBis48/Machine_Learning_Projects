	<TEXT> You said daughter, so I'm going to ask, but the child that dies in Mad Max, named Sprog (or, at least that's what they call the child) is a boy, not a girl. So why all the girl visions? That was the only thing I didn't get, but I chalked it up to Max having a long line of adventures where we couldn't save people that we haven't seen. I mean, The Road Warrior, Thunderdome, and Fury Road could all fit into about a month's worth of time so obviously there's a lot of surviving going on that we don't see. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Or is there something I'm missing here? If an earthquake (like in Nepal) is caused by one plate slipping underneath another, that means the whole plate moved. What happened to all the other stuff sitting on top of that plate, especially at the other side of the plate where it meets another plate.

Edit: Thanks for the answers, this makes sense to me. </TEXT>

They wanted to see the sights, so 5 mile hike in the Marin headlands on Saturday morning, another 6 that afternoon on the Dipsea. 12 on Mt. Diablo on Sunday, plus assorted running around etc... I threw my diet out of the window, kept within my calories, but most of them were imbibed in the form of fermented barley water. Needless to say, I was more than a little sore.

But this morning I still woke up at 5, dropped my cousin off at the airport and dragged my ass into the gym. Put up the weights I was supposed to be doing and lifted them. My body wasn't happy with me and complained the whole time, but I didn't care. I did it and I feel better because of it. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> This weekend was pretty rough. My wife wanted to plant sunchokes, cauliflower, and some spinach which meant more underground planters (to thwart the gophers). So, three, 3' by 5' by 20 inches deep holes later I cut some wood for the planter sides, put down some chicken wire and filled the holes back in. Of course, this is in the sunniest part of the yard, and luckily the sun decided to break through the fog this weekend in the north bay, so that sucked. 

Later that day, since I have some friends visiting we decided to go hit a new trail that I'd heard of but hadn't done yet in west Marin. It was a little tougher than I expected. Couple mile hike each way with some non-trivial climbing (not horrible, but not a walk in the park either) to get to the bottom part of the waterfall. Again, the usual cool and foggy coast decided to be sunny and beautiful on Saturday. Crank up the heat.

Sunday was full of walking around the city with same friends, and if you've ever walked around San Francisco you know our hills are no joke. Tally up a couple hours of that nonsense. So, yeah, by the end of the weekend my legs were pretty toast. 

I still woke up this morning and dragged my ass into the gym. I did my Stronglifts and even threw another 5 pounds on my squats like I'm supposed to. That puts me 5 pounds away from 200 pound squats. Pretty impressive since I struggled with just the 45 pound bar 3 months ago. So yeah fat, suck it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I live in Marin and work in Fremont. My commute home, regardless of whether I leave work at 11:00AM or 7:00PM or anytime in between is horrible. Why is this highway so ridiculously bad? It seems like even if there's not an accident there's a back up at least once along the way where we just sit there for 15 minutes going 5 mph. 

I ride the motorcycle most of the time, so it's not as bad for me. But the days I drive really, really suck. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sorry to hear it man. That sucks. All I can say is keep your head up and remember that no matter how shitty it seems to you, your son will never remember even an ounce of it. So if it gets too much, keep in mind that it's okay to put him in a safe place (like the crib) and let him cry while you and your wife take a time out. Also, I can tell you from experience that eventually you'll be so tired that you just sleep through the screaming. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> LabVIEW Home is kind of a test subject for NI. If all goes well LabVIEW will be a free IDE in late 2016, the toolkits and add-ons will still cost money, but the development environment and executable compiler will be free. Not open source, but as close as you'll ever get with NI. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It feels good doesn't it. Now you can stop worrying about getting your knee down and go faster. 

Edit: This was meant light-hearted, not saying that you're not trying to go fast, or just that you're out there trying to get your knee down. The first time I got my knee down it was like a weight had been lifted and I could stop thinking about when it was gonna happen. The next session after I got my knee down I dropped two seconds off my lap. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There's talk of them in the hills on the west side of Novato, been warnings about being careful early and late. We have chickens and some of our friends with chickens that live a little west of us (we're at Hill and Diablo) have lost some to Mountain Lions, so they're apparently pretty active in Marin at the moment. Obviously not directly relevant to Pleasanton, just saying. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I thought about the control panel stuff, but it already looks a little crowded for my taste. I'm thinking of making the cabinet graphic, as well as the marquee and sample screen sizes smaller. If that looks better, than maybe adding a control panel graphic below it. I originally had the listing be a grid of flyers, but that was way too crazy looking for my taste. I'm all about simple I guess. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Agreed, as I mentioned in another reply, I cut a lot of corners to get something working with my hardware set, my folder structure, etc... I really hadn't thought about other people liking it enough to want to use it. I guess if there's enough people that like the finished product, I could generalize some of it and put some settings in there (like font style, size, etc...) to make it more consumable by the MAME society. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I might consider generalizing some stuff to make it run on someone else's computer, if people like it enough. For now I cut a lot of corners on the setup knowing I had control of where everything was in folders and what games I was putting on it, what monitor I was using, etc... I honestly did it because I felt like the effort I put in to writing my own front end was probably similar to the effort required to get Hyperspin or MaLa up and going. I didn't really think anyone would like it enough to want to use it. </TEXT>
