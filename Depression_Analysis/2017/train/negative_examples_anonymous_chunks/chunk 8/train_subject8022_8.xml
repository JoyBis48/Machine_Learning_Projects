	<TEXT> Russia is really pumping up the anti-US sentiment. This week they also warned Russians travelling abroad to watch out for US teams that "hunt Russians". It's a cold war tactic. 

Perhaps some of the social media companies being targeted should cut service to Russia and announce they cannot comply with the data rules, and therefore are removing their services per Russia's request. Russian citizens would likely direct their outrage towards the Russian government at that point, and the social media companies could re-emerge in the Russian market victorious. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Less than 24 hours isn't nearly enough time of advance notice on mass media if you want a lot of people to attend your rally. Not only do people have to make the decision of whether they want to go or not, they'd also need time to plan for it.

If you want a real protest call it something like a "Rally for US" or "Rally for Freedom", and start spreading information about which cities are selected for demonstrations, at least a week in advance (even if the bill passes by then, with a big enough protest it's possible the demonstrations will spark calls to revoke the bill from within the senate).

Make those on social media feel like they 'are' the rally movement, and not just merely invited to someone else's party.

And last but not least, make sure you get volunteers to bring food. Protests will never last long without food vendors. Iron fisted governments target food vendors with high priority when looking to quell a protest, but I suspect you will not have that issue in the US.

Good luck. :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  "The US Bureau of Labor Statistics lists that 915,000 people are employed in motor vehicles and parts manufacturing. Truck, bus, delivery, and taxi drivers account for nearly 6 million professional driving jobs. **Virtually all of these jobs will be eliminated within 10-15 years, and this list is by no means exhaustive.**"

This seems incredibly unlikely. Even if fully automated cars/trucks are commonly available by them, the switch is still going to be very gradual. A lot of people will still want their own cars even if they're automated, and it will likely take decades to transition there. Delivery companies don't have unlimited capital, and there are a lot of small companies out there, they aren't going to just switch the moment automated trucks become available.

I look forward to automated cars/trucks, but let's be realistic about it. </TEXT>

Will you be using the storage tanks for drinking water too? If so you may want to check with the feed store, they look like poly tanks. While growing up out in the country years ago, we had a neighbor who wanted to setup poly tanks from the feed store for drinking water, but was told they are unsafe because chemicals leak out and they are often treated with fire retardants. It's probably fine, but you may wish to dig for a little more info about the tanks.

Edit: I should mention they did eventually setup poly tanks, but they had to get tanks that were certified to be safe for drinking water.  </TEXT>

Additionally there is a rather scary scenario where a previously antibiotic resistant infection responds to a different class of antibiotic, but by then it results in an opportunistic infection with resistant c. diff. bacteria. C.Diff bacteria is now highly resistant to antibiotics and kills more than 30,000 people each year in the US alone. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I grew up on a farm and was told by the chemical reps that Roundup was perfectly safe, so as a kid I was sent down into the canyons near our farm to spray out Canadian Thistles with a backpack sprayer full of roundup. Sometimes I'd come back soaked with it from blowback that came from the nozzle. I now have a lot of health issues, and it's clear Roundup is not as safe as Monsanto claims... but I had extremely heavy exposure as did my siblings and neighbors, and there were no acute effects from it. I find many cases of children dying from being near sprayed coca plantations in Columbia unlikely. If it's true children are dying near the sprayed coca, it must either be from something else besides Roundup, or they are being exposed to heavy quantities of Roundup in some other way. Getting caught in the spray from a helicopter/plane is not that much exposure. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Jesus. Everybody in the initial situation lacked street smarts. If you see people fighting/arguing without many other bystanders around, standing in the middle of the street and recording them, and then being somewhat verbally combative with them is not a smart move. It's likely only going to escalate the situation.

It seems pretty common for people to get into arguments near  bars when I'm in Idaho, and when that happens I'll just chill inconspicuously nearby either alone or with friends. In almost all cases either the argument burns out, or the cops come... But if I were to stand in the street obviously filming them when they were already running on adrenaline, nothing good is going to come of it.

Hopefully this guy now knows he shouldn't try the 'in your face' type filming he does with police; with ordinary people already distressed... without expecting escalation. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you look up specs for your SSD you'll see the data retention rate in the spec. For consumer level drives it is typically 3 months. For example here is a spec for Seagate drives: http://www.seagate.com/www-content/product-content/ssd-fam/600-pro-ssd/en-us/docs/100727924b.pdf . Section 2.1 lists the data retention rate.

As far as how the data is lost, assuming manufacturing quality is generally consistent across the drive... you'll theoretically lose the cells with the most write cycles first. Most consumer drives store 2 bits per cell, so you'll be losing 2 bits at the lowest level, but depending on how the flash controller is designed you'll likely be losing larger blocks of data once you hit the data retention threshold under the right conditions.

Most people will likely be able to store the data for years without problems. The data retention period is basically what the manufacturer is guaranteeing with their spec before they see any risk. 

**Edit:** I looked up a Sandisk whitepaper about a controller  (http://www.sandisk.com/assets/docs/NetApp%20Write-Intensive%20SSD%20White%20Paper.pdf) and it has a good write-up about data retention:

 We work closely with OEM partners to provide needed device-replacement guidance, as well as information
related to expected data retention (that is, how long the flash media can retain data before it becomes
unreliable). It is important to be aware that there is a limited data retention period once SSDs have been
removed from service (that is, powered off). Retention is also dependent on operating and storage temperatures
and the endurance remaining on the device when it was taken out of service. Although the data retention
period for some HDDs can be measured in years, SSD retention is more typically measured in weeks or days
once the device is powered off. The Lightning Write-Intensive SAS SSDs are capable data retention of 90 days
at end of life </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They still have some lesser-known hurdles to overcome, most consumer drives have a relatively low data retention period of ~3 months. What is a "data retention period" for SSDs? It's the length of time the manufacture claims you can have an SSD powered off before it'll begin to lose data.

Unlike mechanical magnetic hard-drives, today's SSDs need to be periodically powered on or else they will begin to lose data. I don't think many people realize this, even those using them in enterprise solutions. So mechanical hard drives won't be able to be replaced by SSDs at the consumer level for all scenarios, until consumer SSDs data retention rates improve, even if SSDs are eventually cheaper. For this reason, we probably won't be seeing any trustworthy external backup drives using SSDs for a long while. </TEXT>

Some days she'd spend an entire afternoon/evening cam'ing and make several thousand dollars.

Eventually she stopped because she wanted to be a good role model for her young daughter (though it's not like her kid was around when she was on the cam), but I'm sure she made well over two hundred thousand in a relatively short period of time, because she bought a condo in downtown Seattle. It was crazy. It was also awkward at times, because here I was working my career and saving for a house, and she was pretty much getting more money thrown at her for talking and dancing at home... But I don't hate on it, it's a much much safer way for a girl to make quick money than some of the alternatives, especially if they are smart about it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I may be bias because I'm an employee, but MSFT is my go to dividend stock, followed by Johnson   Johnson.

Growth is all about timing, so I don't really have a favorite.  I don't like taking major risk, so my 'growth' stocks may not be viewed as such by everyone. But lately I've had a lot of stock in Disney for growth, though it's slowing down and I'm looking at energy related stocks as replacements. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In their early/mid 20s I think people still believe they can get super rich by putting in great day-to-day work at a very well established corporation. By their late 20s and early 30s it begins to become clear that those dreams are rarely reached unless you're willing to work there until your 40s or 50s. When that realization is hit I think most people will either quit to create/join a startup, or de-emphasize work and focus on their personal lives instead. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There are a lot of illnesses out there that attack the nerves and can cause temporary paralysis, one of the most well known being "Guillain-Barre Syndrome". People with GBS can be fine one week and paralyzed the next, only to recover days or weeks later. 

Unfortunately however, neurology is still a very young field and there are many unknowns still out there. I was partially paralyzed in 2012 after having a year of slowly progressing neurological issues and spent a month in the hospital. The paralysis went away but the other issues continue. Tests were run daily, experts from universities came in, yet nobody was able to determine the exact cause. It's crazy. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If it's a formal declaration, I'd first sell all my stocks and transfer all my cash to the same bank. Then I'd go to that bank, take out a significant amount of cash and buy silver as a hedge against the possibility of a future financial system collapse. After hauling it to a secure location, I'd load up on food staples with long shelf lives to increase my chances of survival in the event of severe food disruptions.

I'd talk to my parents who live on a farm and work with them to provide long-lasting food supplies as well. Then I'd buy a motorcycle and extra gas for if I need to get out of the city and make it to my parents' farm.

I wouldn't really be worried about a nuclear attack, but I'd be worried about disruption of already fragile systems (power, food   fuel supply).

After increasing the chances of my survival for a future disturbance, I'd seek out individuals/companies/the government in search of war projects that I could assist with... Because I find it doubtful that a war with Russia would require a massive draft, yet I'd like to help where I can. </TEXT>

The good news is that Washington is still getting a lot of precipitation, so if those managing the reservoirs make smart decisions to hold back more water earlier than usual, there probably won't be a catastrophic water shortage.    </TEXT>
