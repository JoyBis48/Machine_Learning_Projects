	<TEXT> "You shouldn't try, you probably won't get it."

A girl once told me that in high school when I asked her if I should inquire about being captain for my school's ROV team. She wasn't even joking, that statement alone likely says more about her personality than anything else. Needless to say, it really lit a fire under my ass and I was captain for my last two years of high school. 

I remember her every time I wonder whether I should do something I'm unsure of. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hmmm. That's a tough one! I can't say there is one proud moment that stands out above the rest. It's just all the little things that I've done that bring people a smile, a laugh or that make their lives easier somehow. I just love to hear people laugh! If I can make someone's day better, I just made myself proud. How 'bout you OP? What's your proudest moment? </TEXT>
