	<TEXT> Very accurate depiction of what I observe on a daily basis. I'm from the newest generation of workers, fresh out of college with a results oriented culture and I work at a government agency where there's a lot of bureaucracy.

People are lazy, incompetent, and inefficient. It's just the culture here. I tried to outshine other peers when I started here but it was met with a negative response. I was seen as over stepping my bounds. It's all about seniority here. It's not about how much work you do but about how long you've been here.

	<TEXT> I think you missed the point. The original post was about replacing a flat tire. Most people would just use the car jack. Using a jack stand to replace a flat shouldn't be necessary since you shouldn't be under the car while replacing a flat anyway.

Any time you are underneath the car, it is crucial to use jack stands. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I limit myself to drinking only on the weekends (2 days). So I don't keep track of my carbs very closely on those days. 

I figure if I'm going to drink I might as well enjoy myself. Sorry, I don't have any accurate numbers for carb comparison for you.

I did a Google search and for 12oz of St. Bernardis I'm seeing 20-30g of carbs. That's no where near the 3g of carbs from Michelob ultra, but the choice for me is piss water vs. something I like to drink.

Edit: I scanned the bar code on a 12oz shock top just for fun. My fitness pal lists the following: 168cal, 15g carbs, 2g protein. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'd like to offer an alternative train of thought. 

I drink beers with the highest alcohol content I can find. Gulden Drak, St. Bernardis ABT. 12, Delerium Tremens, La Fin Du Monde, are a few of my favorites.

They are all close to 9-10% abv. I would rather drink less beer with higher alcohol content than drink low carb beer, but end up drinking more. Added benefit, the beers are much better tasting and because I'm drinking less fluid overall, I feel less bloated. </TEXT>

To answer your question about my goal weight. At 164lbs with 18% bf I have about 29lbs of fat. At my GW of 160lbs with 12% bf, I'll have about 19lbs of fat.

So my transition from 164lbs to 160lbs would involve losing fat at the same time, gaining muscle. Not a huge weight difference but my body composition would change. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hello, I've been doing keto for about 2 months now and have stumbled upon /r/ketogains 

I'm trying to get some more muscle definition and size but I'm unsure if my current method is the most efficient.

Right now, I'm working out about 4 days a week (mostly lifting). I'm on a 18% calorie deficit. I've noticed some size and definition but from reading around, I can only surmise that this may be "noob gains." 

It makes sense to me that in order to gain muscle, you have to eat more calories than you expend, so those calories can go towards muscle growth (to put it in very simplified terms, I know it's more complicated than that).

I noticed also though, that I've begun to plateau as far as seeing the quick results as I did from the beginning. Can I have some feedback? I'm worried if I eat at a surplus, I will gain fat as well (along with muscle, hopefully).

Is it possible to lose fat and build muscle while on a caloric deficit? Or should I bulk and then cut?
