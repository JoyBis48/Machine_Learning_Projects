	<TEXT> I hear you 100%. I feel like dwelling on the past has been my #1 problem in life. I've found it helpful to just keep myself super busy at present on things that will help me in the future. Working hard at work to get promoted, working out at the gym, taking some night classes. All these things keep me too busy to worry about regrets or past experiences and help build a solid foundation for me to be better off in the future.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I regularly do 60+ just at my job alone. I think the biggest thing for me is that once I'm in my office I do nothing but work until I leave. So maybe it's about picking a location and forcing yourself to go there. It doesn't have to be an office, but maybe go to a library or somewhere where you won't be distracted by "fun" things, and just make it a rule that you are going to spend X number of hours there everyday. 

I think getting into a routine and sticking to it is the biggest thing that helped me.  </TEXT>
