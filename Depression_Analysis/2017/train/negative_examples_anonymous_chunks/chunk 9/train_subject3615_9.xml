**STRANGE** that the CIA spent untold amounts on operations as well as untold amounts of cash bribing everyone they could in Afghanistan and Pakistan to find out where UBL was...then they finally get lucky--after spending BILLIONS--and have an informer  WALK-IN who worked for the Pakistani ISI come in and cough up UBL's location. 

**STRANGE** that the U.S. gave [Military Aid to Pakistan](http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/row/pakaid.pdf)--over $30 Billion since 9/11. 

**STRANGE** that [Porter Goss and Bob Graham](http://www.foreignpolicyjournal.com/2014/03/17/the-911-joint-congressional-inquiry-and-28-missing-pages/) were with the head of the Pakistan's ISI on 9/11 in Washington DC

**STRANGE** that the head of Pakistan's ISI quit about a week after 9/11 because a newspaper from India published an [article outing him as having sent the 9/11 hijackers money](http://www.propagandamatrix.com/india_helped_fbi_trace_isi_terrorist_links.htm)

	<TEXT> Former NSA Insiders Thomas Drake, William Binney (et al.) wrote an open letter to POTUS in January, 2014...

------------------

Full Letter: http://consortiumnews.com/2014/01/07/nsa-insiders-reveal-what-went-wrong/

"The sadder reality, Mr. President, is that NSA itself had enough information to prevent 9/11, but chose to sit on it rather than share it with the FBI or CIA. We know; we were there. We were witness to the many bureaucratic indignities that made NSA at least as culpable for pre-9/11 failures as are other U.S. intelligence agencies...

...My first day on the job at NSA was 9/11. I was immediately charged as the lead NSA executive to find and deploy the best technology at NSA for the fight against terrorism....

...Thats where I found the pre- and post-9/11 intelligence from NSA monitoring of some of the hijackers as they planned the attacks of 9/11 had not been shared outside NSA. This includes critical pre-9/11 intelligence on al-Qaeda, even though it had been worked on by NSA analysts. I learned, for example, that in early 2001 NSA had produced a critical long-term analytic report unraveling the entire heart of al-Qaeda and associated movements. That report also was not disseminated outside of NSA.

Make no mistake. That data and the analytic report could have, should have prevented 9/11...

...In short, when confronted with the prospect of fessing up, NSA chose instead to obstruct the 9/11 congressional investigation, play dumb, and keep the truth buried, including the fact that it knew about all inbound and outbound calls to the safe house switchboard in Yemen. NSAs senior leaders took me off the task because they realized  belatedly, for some reason  that I would not take part in covering up the truth about how much NSA knew but did not share.

When the 9/11 Commission hearings began, Director Hayden chortled at executive staff meetings over the fact that the FBI and CIA were feeling the heat for not having prevented 9/11. This was particularly difficult for me to sit through, for I was aware that NSA had been able to cover up its own culpability by keeping investigators, committees, and commissions away from the truth."

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racketeer_Influenced_and_Corrupt_Organizations_Act

The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, commonly referred to as the RICO Act or simply RICO, is a United States federal law that provides for extended criminal penalties and a civil cause of action for acts performed as part of an ongoing criminal organization. The RICO Act focuses specifically on racketeering, and it allows the leaders of a syndicate to be tried for the crimes which they ordered others to do or assisted them, closing a perceived loophole that allowed a person who instructed someone else to, for example, murder, to be exempt from the trial because he did not actually commit the crime personally.[1]

Michael Hastings said the DoD has 27,000 people working on Public Relations under a $4.5 Billion yearly budget. Hastings also revealed the military has directed Psy Ops which targeted U.S. senators in order to effect the budget.

	<TEXT> Can't believe no one watched this--apparently the Ugly known unknown is too dark a path for Americans to face. I was surprised when I heard Errol Morris was doing this doc; but then Rumsfeld is such a close clone of Robert McNamara its quite scary--so the film was basically a Part II to *Fog of War*. 

I think Errol Morris is a talented film maker but is extremely misguided in allowing the two War Criminals such a soft, dreamy setting to say their Final Peace. McNamara liked to play with numbers, Rumsfeld tittillates himself with words--but they both enriched themselves by waging war against countries which never threatened U.S. mainland soil. 

Errol Morris dedicating the film to Roger Ebert, who pushed Hollywood escapism (American propaganda) onto Americans for decades, was a fitting ending. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ike certainly had some fine moments--but it wasn't all rosy in the White House...This is from one of my favorite books...

-----

Jan. 5, 1961: At the last, Dwight Eisenhower exploded in anger and frustration. "The structure of our intelligence organization is faulty," he told Allen Dulles. It makes no sense, it has to be reorganized, and we should have done it long ago. Nothing had changed since Pearl Harbor. "I have suffered an eight-year defeat on this," said the President of the United States. He said he would "leave a legacy of ashes" to his successor.

The U.S. is facing extreme turbulence from the rampant corporatism--this has spread to the to the Wars for Profit which we are now entrenched in. The corporate media will print anything the Pentagon or POTUS spits out (only rarely bothering to actually investigate...often the original story will be false, but the effect of the original false story will have achieved its objective). </TEXT>

[**NO WRONGDOING HERE, JUST 6,300 SETTLEMENTS**](http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2015/05/no-wrongdoing-here-just-6300-corporate-fines-and-settlements.html)

"This spreadsheet is all the corporate fines/settlements Ive been able to find sourced articles about, mostly in the period from the 1990s up to today (with a few 80s and 70s). This is by far the most comprehensive list of such things online. At least that I could find, because the lack of any decent list is what made me start compiling this list in the first place.        

What struck me was the sheer number of corporate violations of laws and regulationsthousands upon thousands, the vast majority of which occurred since corporate profits began their incredible ascent in the early 2000sand the list of those paying hundreds of millions of dollars in fines and settlements, which reads like a whos who of Corporate America and Top 100 Global Corporations.

Many have a long list of fines and settlements, and many of the fines are in excess of $100 million. Many are for blatant cartel price-fixing, not disclosing the dangers of the companys heavily promoted medications, destroying documents to thwart an investigation of wrong-doing, etc."

I have also begun to see the NYT, WaPo, cbs (etc.) as basically "State Sponsored" and recently mentioned on r/theInside that the MSM links should be immediately labeled as such (flair added).

The RICO Act focuses specifically on racketeering, and it allows the leaders of a syndicate to be tried for the crimes which they ordered others to do or assisted them, closing a perceived loophole that allowed a person who instructed someone else to, for example, murder, to be exempt from the trial because he did not actually commit the crime personally.[1] </TEXT>

The doc also alleges that the Bank of England "rented" some of their gold to Switzerland which then melted the gold down and SOLD IT to be used in jewelry. This opens the possibility that the US confiscated every citizen's gold in 1933--then turned around and "rented" the gold so the SERFS could buy their own gold back in the form of expensive jewelry. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thomas Drake (et al.) wrote this in January, 2014:

------------------

Full Letter: http://consortiumnews.com/2014/01/07/nsa-insiders-reveal-what-went-wrong/

"The sadder reality, Mr. President, is that NSA itself had enough information to prevent 9/11, but chose to sit on it rather than share it with the FBI or CIA. We know; we were there. We were witness to the many bureaucratic indignities that made NSA at least as culpable for pre-9/11 failures as are other U.S. intelligence agencies...

...My first day on the job at NSA was 9/11. I was immediately charged as the lead NSA executive to find and deploy the best technology at NSA for the fight against terrorism....

...Thats where I found the pre- and post-9/11 intelligence from NSA monitoring of some of the hijackers as they planned the attacks of 9/11 had not been shared outside NSA. This includes critical pre-9/11 intelligence on al-Qaeda, even though it had been worked on by NSA analysts. I learned, for example, that in early 2001 NSA had produced a critical long-term analytic report unraveling the entire heart of al-Qaeda and associated movements. That report also was not disseminated outside of NSA.

Make no mistake. That data and the analytic report could have, should have prevented 9/11...

...In short, when confronted with the prospect of fessing up, NSA chose instead to obstruct the 9/11 congressional investigation, play dumb, and keep the truth buried, including the fact that it knew about all inbound and outbound calls to the safe house switchboard in Yemen. NSAs senior leaders took me off the task because they realized  belatedly, for some reason  that I would not take part in covering up the truth about how much NSA knew but did not share.

When the 9/11 Commission hearings began, Director Hayden chortled at executive staff meetings over the fact that the FBI and CIA were feeling the heat for not having prevented 9/11. This was particularly difficult for me to sit through, for I was aware that NSA had been able to cover up its own culpability by keeping investigators, committees, and commissions away from the truth."

	<TEXT> Just watched this interview Michel Chossudovsky did with James Corbett--he made some comments on the media:

---------------

"We are dealing with a media apparatus which turns realities upside-down...presents the western quest and military adventure as a peace making undertaking...which lies in regards to the casualties of war...which presents the war criminals as protagonists of human rights...and that in itself is the pinnacle of this system.

Without the Main Stream Media and war propaganda this New World Order agenda doesn't have a leg to stand on. In other words, without these media lies the military agenda, the economic agenda would collapse like a deck of cards. And that is why it is absolutely fundamental that--within the realm of independent media and alternative media--**we wage a war against the main stream media**."

	<TEXT> Makes me think of when I was young and ABC news decided to begin a late-night news program: *NIGHTLINE*. The purpose was to update Americans on the U.S. Hostage Situation in Iran. Every day the news media counted off how many days the situation had gone on: DAY 100...DAY 200...DAY 300...DAY 400...the number was on the Front Page of the newspaper and included in every newscast--the nation was at a fever pitch.

But NOT ONCE do I remember any newspaper or news program mentioning that the Hostage Situation was BLOWBACK for what the U.S. did in 1953 when the CIA helped to Overthrow Iran's government.

I wouldn't be surprised if this wasn't used as a template for study within the Pentagon-CIA...How easy it is to get an entire nation to HATE. 

We know the Pentagon-CIA work with Hollywood and the "news" media--what if CNN and Fox "news" were actually created *from the very beginning* with input from the CIA-Pentagon? If they do it with movies--why not extend the reach and do it with cable news? </TEXT>

"When I joined the CIA I believed in the need for its existence.

	<TEXT> Actually, the $40 million which the SSCI funded went entirely to CIA-approved attorneys--so they could splice, dice and redact the 6,400 page Torture Report down to 400 pages (which We, the Serfs could read). 

On the other hand, the 9/11 Commission had offices in a CIA managed building with a staff of 84 people which included attorneys and basic office staff. The 9/11 Commission was also placed under a strict time frame of 16 months--while the Torture Report Re-Write Team was given 4 years to complete the editing of a report which was already finished. (note: the 9/11 Commission was eventually given another $10 million and paid no rent for the office space in the CIA-managed building...cough cough)

With last year's revelation of the SSCI being spied upon by the CIA--I wonder if the CIA also spied on the 9/11 Commission. We do know, from an editorial the 9/11 Commission Co-Chairs wrote to the *New York Times*, that they accused the CIA and the White House of [**OBSTRUCTING THE INVESTIGATION**](http://www.salon.com/2008/01/02/obstruction/) </TEXT>

No apparent "voice-overs" or apparent splices in the video that I've noticed. Unlike many youtube videos, this copy seems to be very high quality...you might be able to do a search for news transcripts   plug in the baltimore station, the date and L. Paul Bremer--see if anything pops up.

edit: even crazier is that L. Paul Bremer had an office in one of the WTC towers--yet did NOT even mention that (or his co-workers) in this interview. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Bremer </TEXT>

He had just finished meeting with the 9/11 Commission--but GWB wouldn't agree to do so IN PUBLIC or ON THE RECORD...Notice GWB stammers at the very beginning because he Can't say he "testified" (because he wasn't under oath)...

For years all us Americans heard from the White House was [**"9/11"..."9/11"..."9/11"**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMkyL_YJDUc)...but GWB couldn't even answer more than 5 questions to the press after meeting up with the 9/11 Commission? GWB even had to bring along Dick Cheney (and a slew of attorneys) to the meeting to hold his hand...

appropriately enough, the press conference ends with the sounds of sirens in the background--Police State USA. </TEXT>

After 9/11 [**Dick Cheney asked Sen. Tom Daschle NOT to investigate 9/11**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePOIhhd9Jr0)...Cheney/Bush stalled the formation of the 9/11 Commission for over a year--then under-funded the commission. The 9/11 Commission was initially funded with $3 million (compare that to the $40 million initial funding which the SSCI Torture Report Re-Write received in Dec. 2008).  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes, r/worldnews readers--you are being conned. Besides the obvious outright censorship of websites and subject matter, the larger subs also partake in SWITCHING OFF THE COUNTER for articles which they don't like. Supposedly this is just a natural function of reddit to keep the articles circulating and not sit atop the front page too long.

A post I made yesterday ([an Italian article which interviewed Vladimir Putin](http://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/3907i8/vladimir_putin_i_invite_you_to_publish_a_world/)) made me realize this was going on--once it got to the Top Spot, the counter was turned off--no more up votes calculated. The counter on my post went off at 4800 votes or so...odd, right now there are two posts on the worldnews front page with over 5600 votes...

Most people would never notice this--just thought I'd fill you in... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> FYI: The Corporate Media receives quite a bit of money from the DoD; therefore thay are Pentagon Bootlickers--which mainly suggests they are incapable of investigating or criticizing the DoD. The goal is to deceive the American public (mission accomplished).

And, YES, reddit--thru their nazi adminstrators and mods--are signed and sealed Pentagon Bootlickers as well. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My latest theory is that OPERATION DARKHEART (which tracked Al Qaeda cells via open source communications--and located at least 4 of the hijackers in the USA at least 1 year prior to 9/11) was not intended to catch hijackers...OPERATION DARKHEART was intended as a TRIAL--it was research by the DIA for a project which would go into effect after 9/11 once the funding was provided. The DIA didn't want Lt. Col. Anthony Shaffer to inform Congressional investigators because they didn't want the investigators digging deeper into the project and asking what the project was designed to do. </TEXT>
