	<TEXT> Precalc is a much harder course than AP Stats. At my school, people take it as an alternative to precalc. If you're comfortable taking two math classes at once, go for it. The two classes aren't too related-pretty much opposite types of math. Precalc has a lot of algebra and trig where stats has a lot of...stats. I've heard there is much more writing that a typical math class as well. 

Does your school offer AP Macro/Micro economics? If so, take those. Relatively easy courses if you stay on top of the readings as notes, and they're fairly interesting. Taking precalc would be wise since it would better prepare you for any math classes you choose in college. 

In short, if you're willing to do two math classes at once, go for AP Stats and international relations along with precalc.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Maybe a blue color scheme? Not much reasoning for this - blue is just a nice color. It's the opposite of pink but still goes nicely with pink, so there's that. 

I think air for posts would be fantastic! Product review, product request, swatches, dupe, dupe request, FOTD, and list of favorites is all I can think of for flairs, but that's what's usually posted in the makeup subs. 

Honestly, I love how fast this sub grew. My nearest makeup stores besides Kohls are 45 minutes away, and my wallet is always afraid of going with!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hot or cold sub? I get six inches, so just double anything number specific if you're going for a footlong. 

If you're looking for a hot sub, steak and cheese on Italian herbs and cheese. I get it toasted with provolone and pepper jack alternating. For veggies, I do lettuce, just enough spinach to cover the lettuce, green peppers, and onions. Mayo, oil, pepper, and oregano. Most delicious sub on the planet. 

For a good cold sub, I go with a BMT on herb and cheese. I always change the cheese on this depending how I feel that day. Today I'd throw american on, but I've used everything down to mozzarella. Lettuce, just two spinach leaves (since I make my own subs and can be difficult with veggies; gauge the artist on this one), tomatoes, two cucumbers (I'm not a big fan, but they add something), green peppers, yellow peppers, and olives. Then add mayo, chipotle, oil, pepper, oregano, and parmasean. 

Definitely bend the subs a bit to fit your own tastes or if your store doesn't offer something I suggested.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You're eating an entire foot of food. First, think of the loaf of bread. That's a lot of bread. Next, think of the meats, cheese, and sauces. These three things are quite fatty (usually) which will help keep you satiated. Next, you have veggies. These are going to be more nutrient dense than french fries so they'll keep you fuller longer. 

A footlong sub is a lot of food, and it will feel like it. Just be careful eating these too often. I feel bad when I get the same customer every time I work. The sodium amounts alone on these things are ridiculous.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Join something! I waited until my junior year to join a sport and it stung. Sports at my school are a bit pricey so my parents didn't want to, but they realized the value of a sport after a college tour. 

If you don't want to join a sport, that's fine. I'm not the best athlete and I joined bowling for my sport so I won't push a sport. There is a ton of other things to do while in high school. 

Get a job. If you do this, hold the job and keep your grades up. If you don't have much extra going on through school, a job will help you save up for college and your boss might just connect you with someone who can land you that internship your freshmen year of college. Having a good relationship with your manager or supervisor is also good as they can serve as a reference on your resume. 

Volunteer! Some schools have clubs for this, others don't. If yours doesn't, start researching local volunteer opportunities. Humane societies and elderly homes are just a couple things that come to mind. Colleges love to see 100+ volunteer hours, and you could build that up over summer. That's barely over 4 days. Just make sure you document these hours. Talk to your counselor and see if volunteer hours go on your transcript. 

Don't have any clubs at your school that you're interested in? You can start with a special interest group, or a big club such as Model United Nations or Bots IQ. You're likely going to need a teacher to help you start a club. If it's one of the bigger clubs such as Model UN or Bots, there may be some fees associated with these, but colleges find participating in more major clubs a very big plus. 

There are lots of things to do in high school, you just have to find them. Flyer for an event on the wall? Flyer asking for students to help set something up or run an event? Grab a couple friends, or even go on your own, and try it out. Worst case scenario is that you don't like it and you move on.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Colleges like to see rigor, but they also like to see success. I'll have 7 AP classes under my belt by the time I'm out of high school. A few of those were more challenging alternatives to a required course, so they just ended up being the better option. I have all B's in my AP courses, but at my junior conference I was told that would be more impressive to admissions than A's in common core classes. 

The best way to benefit from AP is make sure you take courses that you can hold a 78% or higher in and courses that you are confident you will get the credit for. If money is a challenge for your family, don't load up on AP since the test is $80 per class, although your school might offer assistance options. Check with your guidance councilor on those. 

Overall, you need to assess your own abilities. If you haven't chosen courses for next year already, look at your current classes. Are there any in a subject that you found easy and want an extra challenge in? Does your school offer any AP classes that are interesting? Are you at Spanish/German/etc level 4 this year or through your junior year? Your school might offer an AP level 5 that is challenging, but you will have 4 years of experience in. (Your school's foreign language system may be a bit different than this).  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think the lack of drugstore testers is what attributes to a lot of Ultas used product problems. I was hoping to get my foundation there as a drugstore one, but I couldn't swatch any of it! 

MAC online is definitely a more comfortable experience. While I was at the Macy's counter, I swatched a few shadows to see what I should add to my list since I was already way over my limit for the day. Definitely felt better over there than in the store. I feel like the store is there for people who know exactly what they're looking for and aren't too concerned with how much it costs. Maybe that'll be me in a few years, but for now I'm just fine with swatching at Macy's and picking up some products online.  </TEXT>

The store was also very clean and well stocked. Only problem I had was the used products problem. I bought two NYX concealer sticks and right before I got to the register, I realized one was used! They weren't even sealed! Still signed up for the rewards card since my good experience definitely calls for a revisit. 

I also went to Sephora, MAC, and I browsed the MAC selection at Macy's since the actual store was a bit intimidating. Sephora was what I expected, I probably should have accepted the employees' help after circling the store three times for a beauty blender! I think with MAC, I'll be sticking to the Macy's counter. It seemed to be all the same things but with prices posted and less people glaring at me.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Some coupons are location specific. Was it a printed coupon or from one of those official coupon clipper things or the newspaper? Granted, even if it is a bigger coupon, they may still not accept. They should change their sign to say as such. 

On the other hand, that employee may have a rude and/or lazy one. In my store, we accept any coupon we can, but a sign for showing coupons ahead of time would be great. Often, people will bring in BOGO coupons, get three steak subs, then at the register I have to explain to them why the coupon is invalid. 

The new menus make using coupons really tough on customers since they don't list subs as regular or premium anymore, so a lot of people come in thinking anything without extra cheese or bacon works with a coupon.  </TEXT>

If anything, I'll do a little extra cardio. 

With the comments, I try to block them out with people that I don't know too well. If it's a closer friend that I know I can say a dick comment to, I'll give them a snarky reply and it usually shuts them down.

	<TEXT> Generally, keep oils out of a fresh stretch for a week or so until it's healed. I find it best to do massages with the jewelry out so it gets into the piercing and the piercing has time to relax. 

For cleaning, when the stretch is fresh, it's okay to do a soak with the jewelry in, just like its a fresh piercing. If the stretch is all healed up then you can take the jewelry out for sea salt soaks.  </TEXT>

That was my favorite eyeshadow a couple years ago when I was rocking the middle school look. White shadow and black waterline. 

But it was a great quality eyeshadow and I tossed it before writing down the name. Regretted that until I tracked it down. I think this is the product, although the far left color was white on my quad. 

Does anybody know of where I can get this product or a good dupe of it? It was a Physicians Formula Mineral Wear quad but I don't know exactly which colors. I feel like it was discontinued ages ago since I can't find it anywhere on the PF website.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You could ask the employees, but they'll definitely look at you funny. I don't even know if we're allowed to do that. You could always add it afterwards. 

With the prices, they've been going up for a while. Over here in the Midwest, our new menus are really enraging customers. Cheapest sub is $4 and its a six inch. Cheapest footlong is $5.75. I have a feeling subway is slowly moving away from the $5 footlong since it's not too profitable. 

Overall, prices and cheeses are very reasonable. You could decide on your favorite store in your area and talk to them about adding provolone to their options. Chances are, it's very available to them, they just don't know if there's a demand for it. If you'll buy it, they might just add it since it's not a discontinued item.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Pick up some glass single flare from a piercing shop or body art forms. Much easier to stretch with and much safer. Also, head over to Menards or Home Depot (or any hardware store) and pick up a roll of PTFE tape. It's a good $1 or so and IIRC, it's a bit thinner than bondage tape so it's easier to stretch with. Also, the emu oil or vitamin e oil should help more than jojoba for stretching since they're a bit slicker than jojoba. Just remember to completely saturate the PTFE before you wear it or it'll dry out your ears. 

My ears aren't very stretchy either. Just gotta go slow and spoil them.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's okay for it to be a bit pink on the inside, especially after a fresh stretch. You're on the right track though! Stick with quality jewelry, and you're doing the right thing with massages. Also, you might be able to size up in a month, but if your ears start saying no halfway down the taper, it's okay to wait. Some people have no problem getting through small sizes and others take a while to size up from the start. 

Also, be prepared for a bit of frustration, and don't be like me and try to calculate when you'll be at your goal size. You'll be disappointed due to time between stretches increasing with size. It took me 4 months to go from 8g to 6g and I eventually got frustrated and taped up. It's the first full mm stretch, so it's a bit of a fight. Whenever you feel ready to just shove the taper through or add one more layer of tape than usual, look at some of the posts by people who've blown out and you'll want to wait. There's people here with 2" ears. Your goal size is possible. They didn't get there over night, or even in a couple months. 

It's a bit early so I rambled a bit, but stick with generally accepted methods, good jewelry, and don't rush at all. You're asking early, so you're getting a head start on healthy lobes!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So tonight was my first meet at a high oil lane and a longer lane than I'm used to. It was also extremely cold on the bus ride to the alley and in the alley.

My home and proshop alley is nice and room temperature and it's also been a warm winter, so when I got drilled, my thumb was a bit bigger, if not swollen. During practice before we started, my ball fell off my hand. Just dropped. Anyone else ever have the problem of a suddenly too big thumb hole? Usually my thumb swells and needs tape and everything, but today I couldn't feel the hole snug on all sides. This led to me gripping the ball and doing terribly. Should I put in some white tape? The cold weather is sticking around now, but I don't want to be where I usually am with my thumb pretty much stuck and tape in my thumb slug. 

Now my next big problem. I have a Tropical Breeze, so it's a low to medium oil ball. These lanes were drenched. My usual strike shot is standing at 17/18 and target at the second arrow. I ended up having to stand at 23 and target the third arrow to get anywhere near the pocket. No hook at all, or revs. I was really regretting not getting the Crux I was eyeing up since this is my first ball. I've read it's high oil? 

TL;DR: How do you bowl high oil with a low oil ball? Any solutions when it's so cold that my ball fits like a house drill? Bad meet due to conditions, and I want to know how to improve, especially on those conditions since I'm at that alley again next week.  </TEXT>

I don't have much of a solution for it yet, beyond keeping my hand cool so it doesn't swell. I assume it's just anatomy making bowling difficult, but it's my first ball, so it might be something your pro shop guy can do something about.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Meet on Monday went terrible. Our team only has 3 so we get 6 frames a game, and we lost a game with only 4 frames in a game. 

Practice went great, though, although nothing I did followed my coach. He wanted me to get more revs on the house ball because I was skidding to the point of rolling with a slight backwards spin. Okay, more revs it is. There's the gutter. Skid the ball down the lane? Strike it is. House balls are bad. 

And for the reason I was on a house ball. I took my ball in last week Wednesday to get drilled, and the pro shop guy said Friday or so. I couldn't pick it up over the weekend, so it didn't matter that it was Friday. I'd get it my next practice on Tuesday. Pro shop guy isn't in. No problem. I go in on Wednesday to pick it up and the pro shop guy said the papers got moved around so he couldn't drill it over the weekend. Now, I'm not exactly mad about this. I'm getting the drilling at a huge discount and I'll finally have my ball so in pretty excited, I'm just worried about only having one practice on it before the meet next Monday. I'll have to come in over the weekend to practice with it since it's my first fingertip. I'm hoping it bumps my average over 100 and my fill above 55%. 
/rant 

If you guys have any at-home tips I can use to get used to my ball, it would be super appreciated.  </TEXT>
