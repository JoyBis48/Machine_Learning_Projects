	<TEXT> I'm not actually in "the industry" yet! I'm just a student who's done a handful of industry and academic internships! I'm a major in Geomatics/Spatial engineering which is really IMHO a black horse field. Basically, I work with GIS related projects as well as remote sensing and also do programming work with SQL and Matlab related to the GIS stuff. </TEXT>
