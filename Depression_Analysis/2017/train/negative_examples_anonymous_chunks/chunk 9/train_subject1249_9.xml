	<TEXT> I have the hardest time with sitting down to watch a TV show especially when it does not interest.  I can sit down and watch an espisode of GOT fine, but I struggle to watch reruns a lot of other shows.  I also live in at house where there is one TV and I have to be especially sensitive of other people's TV needs.  I usually spend my time on the computer where i can surf website to website and look at what interests me.  However, I believe that it aggravates my ADHD even more. I do not struggle with problem at work where I have lazer sharp focus and can do my jobs for hours on end even it is especially repetive.  Yet, trying to watch a TV show to be a difficult ordeal and I just cannot sit down and watch a TV show until its conclusions unless it is GOT where I force myself to watch the entire episode.  And I never watch movies because I know that I cannot stay still because I am on the computer the entire time.  Do people with ADHD struggle with same struggles that I do and just avoid TV </TEXT>

	<TEXT> However, one huge difference between Bernie and Obama campaigns in the 2008 campaign is that the Bernie's race and gender will neutralize the Obama racism that happened during the 2008 campaign.  However, the Republicanism will use the socialist death label to death and use Sander's anti-interventionist to drum up that Sanders will bring the terrorist back.  Unlike Hillary, the GOP could not resort to the personal character attacks aganist Bernie that they can use aganist Hillary Clinton all of the time.  

In some ways, Bernie would be attacked on policy stances and would not be attacked on race, gender, and personal character attacks that Obama or Hillary faced. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, but what about financial stablity. Financial stablity is defined as "Just because your business is making money doesnt mean its stable. Stability is the ability to withstand a temporary problem, such as a decrease in sales, lack of capital or loss of a key employee or customer. Analyzing your cash flow and a variety of negative scenarios will help you determine whether or not your business is financially stable."

That is very important.  No profits = no jobs.  We are not going to be in socialist utopia any time soon and lot of Americans will not accept it. I prefer socialism but I am also a pragmatic realist that understands that capitalism will be the system of the US for a long time. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The problem about Labor is that it did not properly branding.  Branding is "your promise to your customer. It tells them what they can expect from your products and services, and it differentiates your offering from your competitors".  Labor did not promise any real change or any difference than the conservative problem.  Also, the Conservatives feed into the white's view of xenophobia and will make "Fortress England". Also, a lot of white people in general that I know support the business agenda because they in some day that they will benefit from the system that primary favors the rich instead of realizing the system in the long run is unsustainable and needs to replace with something else.  Therefore, in some ways, the proletarians are the dumb ones themselves because they favor the burgerious agenda.  But P.T Barnum once wrote "There is a sucker born in every minute". </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have an interview with the State next week in Van Nuys and I increasily becoming frustrated that I had not one single offer of employment with the state despite having twenty plus interviews with them.  Some of them I can unprepared but a number of them is where I ex

I just want to nail this one interview and get it done.  The only problem is that I am a (LEAP) candidate which is the program for the state to hire disabled employees even though I qualify for the position on pure experience alone.

I just want some links to a Youtube video or some other resources to assist me. I have in a formal vocational training program right now so I have an instructor that can help, but we just need to find the right resources so he has more information to help me. (Note: I am mainly applying to Office Technician positions). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am very interested in getting involved with Bernie Sanders campaign and helping the campaign get started in Orange County. I do not have time to donate my time to the national campaign, but I can donate significant time during evenings and especially weekends to the campaign.  Does anybody know about the campaign starting here.  I do know there is a litany of progressive organizations that are in the county which I am not involved with, but any campaign involving Bernie Sanders would require extensive coordination with these groups because they prefer their input into any how the county-wide operations is ran.  </TEXT>
