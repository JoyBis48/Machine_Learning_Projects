	<TEXT> It's illegal to sing a copyrighted song on anything (movies, shows, internet videos, your own musical cover, ANYTHING) that you haven't payed a Mechanical License for. While it's highly unlikely that anyone would go after them for singing these, if they just happened to come across and flag it, just because they felt like it, the video would either get removed or all of the revenue would go toward the copyright holder.  If this happens 3 times, the channel gets shut down. 

Why jeopardize your business over that? </TEXT>

I felt there were some storylines that should've been edited down, if not out completely, like when they were hunting Arin/Barry, they didn't need to leave in the "phased" part, they could've just cut to them being found. Little things like that, but mostly, it wasn't as funny as it went on </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I hate the argument about Sonic that "you're running so fast you can't possibly see an enemy coming, so you just get hit!"

That same argument can be applied to any 2D sidescroller. Plus, Sonic isn't about going fast all the time, and when it actually is, they're not gonna put much in the way that is unable to dodge. (can't really say that about the modern games, though) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I played WoW for 30 minutes and felt exactly the same as Arin/Barry. It was NOT fun and the only bit of joy I could scrape from it was messing around with my other friend who, in turn, was not having fun.

The point isn't "let's teach these guys how to have fun with WoW"

The point **is** "let's make these guys play WoW even though they don't want to." 

It was extremely funny to watch them scrape some fun out of this experience that they wanted no part in, that someone worked hard on preparing. There were several moments where I laughed my ass off, the one coming to my head right now is when it cuts to Ross in the interview room, with his head in his hands, not even saying anything, then cutting straight back to the action.

In the end, the entirety of the Game Grumps channel amounts to turning on the recording devices and spouting funny dialogue or waiting for something funny to happen in-game. It's a fucking **comedy** show

  The Grumps have an established fanbase now. They'll watch anything the Grumps put out

Or perhaps there are people who genuinely enjoy this, despite the fact *you* didn't. There is no need to insult people for their tastes and demean something you personally didn't enjoy. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They are comedians joking around. Noone was mean to Ross and Ross was playing up his despair for laughs. This is not meant to be taken seriously in any way, even Ross's work put into crafting the whole thing </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No it's not scripted. That would be so much extra work and ultimately wouldn't be any funnier than if they improvised. 

Plus it just defeats the purpose of the "reality show" angle </TEXT>
