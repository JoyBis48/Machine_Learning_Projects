	<TEXT> Or at least I thought, from an author named Alexander Chee: http://the-toast.net/2015/07/14/an-interview-with-alexander-chee/view-all/

 Can you share some of your views on the current state of publishing, and also how Amazon might be changing the game?

Well, we know publishing profits have improved while writer pay has declined. So that is terrible. Im greatly encouraged by some recent developments in publishing in terms of what is getting published and reviewed.

What worries me most is that we are still in a weird place where, 20 years in, were being told we still dont know how the Internet affects book sales or readership, and so writers cant be paid as much for writing written online  even as every major media outlet is now online and increasingly abandons print editions. Yet so far, you still get paid more for print even though it is often read less  and you get paid less for digital, and yet everyone reads that. That has to change. Because its a scam.

Its time to admit the Internet is here.

I was going through old files and found pay stubs from digital writing I did in 1999 that are roughly what is still getting paid for something that you also have to fact check yourself and in some cases copyedit  but that is also given a title you dont choose. And because of content grabs in contracts, it may not even belong to you.

And so I dont have any comment about Amazon except to say that over time I am less and less interested on any seasonal focus on Amazons most recent moves, whatever they are  like many American companies they are a mix of good and bad, what I agree and disagree with  and Im more and more interested in the larger context for this, the Internet and America, income inequality and the destruction of the creative class. Were in this horrible world where everyone wants everything for free now or almost free because to pay for it reminds them of how little they are paid and that reminds them of their powerlessness in the face of that. Or at least how powerless they feel. And theres so much blocked anger there.

Historically, despots kill the artists, writers, journalists and professors when they seize power, as what they teach is critical thinking, and what comes with that is the ability to resist tyrannies of various kinds. What America is doing, purposefully or not, is historically distinct: delegitimizing the work of that class, and acting as if an education is the tyranny, all while insisting writers and professors make work on starvation wages, while also paying exorbitant fees for everything from healthcare to housing to taxes even on what grants remain. In order for an artist to have any respect they have to have amazing sales  or be dead after a life of poverty. So Id prefer a bigger conversation about all of that instead.

All of which is to say, Amazon isnt changing publishing  everyone involved in publishing is, from the writers to the editors to the readers. If we want to improve publishing we have to talk about the whole thing related to how writers are valued and compensated, and what we want our literature to contain.

	<TEXT> Also, big name authors get SOOO many blurb requests that when they do decide to blurb something it's normally because they truly really liked it. Sure there is some neapotisim involved sometimes (student asking former teacher, publisher asking big name author to do debut author) but even in those cases there are so many former students and so many names being passed along that a big name author is making a choice to blurb.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Have I bought a book solely on the blurb? No. 

But if I liked other parts about the book AND it had blurbs form authors I'd trust, that would make me more likely to buy. 

It's less about trusting the authors to be honest than it is about getting a sense of what kind of book it is. For example, is it a "speculative fiction" book in the vein of George Saunders, Jeff VanderMeer, and Kelly Link? Or is it more like a George RR Martin/Joe Abercrombie kind of thing? 

Blurbs give you an idea.  </TEXT>

In addition to the fact that Amazon's rankings are manipulated too: 

1) While Amazon has a big influence on the market, they aren't even close to 100% of the market, and their sales are skewed (as any single entity would be) by their user base. 

2) There is no way to really "objectively" rank print and digital sales. Is a 25 dollar hardcover sale, a 15 dollar paperback sale, and a $1 dollar ebook sale all the same thing?  </TEXT>

I think it's perfectly fine for the NYT to not count books that didn't really sell to actual humans, but were just bought in bulk by church groups, SuperPacs, and right wing orgs. I don't know if that happened with Cruz or not, but Amazon wouldn't be in any special position to judge that. 

What on earth are the more "objective" sales rankings?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> These reductive things are always pretty silly, as everyone else here is saying. 

I enjoy this one better though: 

All stories are either a man goes on a journey, or a stranger comes to town (and that both are different POVs of the same story.) That is to say, most stories have a routine that is interrupted... either by the protagonist going somewhere or doing something new, or by an outsider character shaking up the routine.  </TEXT>

Another option might be submitting to first book contests that small presses host.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hmm, well I dunno. I know people who basically were unpublished who got agents but most of them either 

A) Came through a big MFA program (or genre problem like Clarion) 

B) Published in another genre (ie, published essays or journalism but wrote fiction on the side)

or 

C) Had some kind of platform to build off of. Big social media presence or the like. 

The problem I think is that there are SO many wannabe writers and SO many people sending work to agents that agents simply can't read it all. They have to filter through it some way. So having connections, or publications, or a platform all give the agent a reason to read the manuscript. Doesn't mean they'll like it, but you will at least get read. 

ETA: Now this might seem unfair, but think about it: even if you self-publish, you are going to probably have a much harder time unless you have some reason (publications, platform, etc.) for people to buy your work over the bazillion others out there.  </TEXT>

The downside is that your agent will almost always get you more money or a better deal, and you are more likely to be picked up if you have an agent. Agents can also hassle publishers to respond in a timely manner in a way that authors can't.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Also, having things online doesn't stop them being published. Of course, you'll have to take them down. But no one would forgo a piece of writing because it was on the internet. I've seen a lot of people have that concern, and a lot of people have replied, stating their fears are unfounded. Don't worry :)

Strong disagree with this. Every editor I know would turn down a piece that was already published for the public online (unless it was a reprint anthology or something.) Yes, you can get away with this since most editors won't google you, but if you do get caught the editor will reject the story and if they think you are acting shady won't ever work with you again.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As someone who works in the industry, I really think you are overrating how likely looks are to matter. I wouldn't say it doesn't matter at all, but I really don't think it's much of a factor. Sure, you can google anyone, but plenty of editors probably don't even know what an author looks like when they sign them. 

Youth, OTOH, probably factors in. Editors want to grab the hot (as in buzzed about) young authors on the rise and will pick up those books over works by middle age authors with middling sales.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey, every year The Millions literary sites posts a huge list of all the awesome books coming out for the second half of the year. Here's the one for this fall: http://www.themillions.com/2015/07/most-anticipated-the-great-second-half-2015-book-preview.html

I know it's a list, but I think it's comprehensive enough to warrant discussion here. What books are you guys excited for that are on this? Or that are missing? 

I'm really excited for 

* UNDERDOMOMAJORMINOR by Patrick DeWitt. His THE SISTERS BROTHERS was one of my favorite books of last decade. 

* THE STORY OF MY TEETH by Valeria Luisilli. She's a really great young Mexican-American writer and Coffee House has been publishing amazing work recently. 

* Clarice Lispector's complete stories. She was amazing. 

Lot of other good stuff coming out too. Good year for books! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's a huge question to get into but a few quick points: 

- The artists on labels are still the rich ones today. You can say "labels demand outrageous cuts!" but basically the only people making a living off of music are on labels, and certainly the only big stars are ones on labels. 

- Look, I hate how exploitative the major record labels were and probably still are. So I'm not defending them. But it is dishonest to compare the profit share numbers without comparing the up front costs. By which I mean, record labels pay for studio time, pay for marketing, maybe evne pay for touring expenses. The "unsigned" artist has to recoup their recording and other costs before they actual make any money.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The benefits of "free" marketing seem to be highly overrated the more I read about it. For example, do you ever look in the /r/selfpublish forum? I do and writers there constantly bemoan the fact that they can give away a book for free and get thousands or tens of thousands of downloads, but then those translate into like 2 sales. 

In the age of everything being free, well, everything is free, so you are drowning in a sea of free content. Being free doesn't make you stand out. Your work can be downloaded by a million people who don't ever actual listen/read/watch it... much less go buy a ticket to a show or a copy of a physical book.

	<TEXT>  With almost no cost to produce or distribute content, the need for media elites as tastemakers is diminishing.

 Traditionally we had media elites that acted as tastemakers. When media is scarce we need elites to know which media to consume.

Man I think you have this completely wrong. 

The problem with society has never been "elites" being tastemakers. It is really bizarre how this right wing hatred of "liberal ivory tower gatekeepers!" has been picked up by supposedly libertarian or liberal people. 

 The problem has been corporate money controlling the media landscape. Controlling what is played on radio, controlling what books get placed prominently in stores, controlling what movies get wide releases, and so on. The "tastemakers" have mostly had pretty fine tastes, but their tastes are normally overruled by the overwhelming power of corporate money and the control of distrobution. 

Has that changed? Not really! 

Yes, theoretically we can all be stars on youtube or Kindle Unlimited, but in reality the rich people with corporate money backing them still completely dominate the media landscape: Marvel films, Taylor Swift, Kim Kardashian, Jurassic World, etc. 

Those people make bank while middle class artists are disappearing. We are left with a world where you are either making nothing but praying and hoping you'll go viral, or else you are a huge star with corporate backing who can leverage your work for payouts (like getting your song in a car commercial)

By eliminating all money that sustains smaller culture pools, the big corporate culture control is maybe greater than ever today. 

 Book has pictures of books that other redditors are currently reading and there are posts on the tv subreddit asking others what they should watch. Instead of looking to some elite tastemaker we are looking to ourselves. This is not just reddit, but all social media. 

Social media is utterly dominated by the same handful of topics. in art, that means it is the same handful of films, TV shows, or books that can be talked about at one time. 

When the currency is "likes" "reblogs" and "shares," the only way to get it is to talk about what everyone else is talking about. You mention subreddits like /r/books, but what actually makes the top page? The same authors over and over: Neil Gaiman, JK Rowling, Stephen King, and a handful of others. Yes, anyone CAN be talked about, but only a few bi name people are talked about enough to get upvotes and get to the top of the page. 

Same with twitter or anything else.  </TEXT>
