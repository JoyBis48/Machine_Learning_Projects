	<TITLE> Psychiatrist appoinment tomorrow </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I have been on Paxil for quite a long time now- 12 years and I feel like it really isn't working anymore.  I also was able to get a few small scripts for Ativan.  Problem is my regular doctor doesn't think i should be taking any benzos for a long period- no more than like a week at a time because its addictive blah blah.  I ran out of my last script of 20 1mg pills and she won't refill it for me so I am kind of in a withdrawl right now.  Sucks because I feel a lot better when I take just one 1mg of Ativan and I don't feel any better when taking my Paxil.  Here is my question: It seems like a lot of people on this forum have a decent ongoing script for benzos.  How did you go about getting it? I'm not asking for a ton of pills, just something that is more longterm that 1 or 2 scripts of 30 pills a year.  My doctor has referred me to a psychiatrist who I see tomorrow and she will be managing my psych meds from now on not my medical doctor.  I wasn't even going to post this but I might have a better shot at getting something that actually works for me on more of an ongoing basis because I feel pretty crappy now!! Thanks for any advice. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> holy shit 90 month! I know that's something you worked up to but yeah.  I've suffered from anxiety and depression my whole life and been on anti depressants most of my life which has been documented.  I have a feeling the one I am taking now isn't doing much but when I took the ativan I was scripted I felt a lot better. I was only taking 1 pill a day, 1 mg. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> are you getting your lorazepam prescribed on an ongoing basis? I have been able to get about 3 scripts within a year for 20 pills but I cannot get an ongoing thing.  Doctor says that it's not a med that can be taken more than a couple weeks at a time.  it's really frustrating!! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I just got a new primary care doctor. I am currently on paxil (12 years) and ativan probably a few months. My new doctor has no problem keeping me on the paxil but hesitantly scripted me some ativan and said that is not a medicine to be taken long times. She is referring me to a psychiatrist to go over my meds and possibly change them. I have a feeling its to get me off ativan.  I never heard anywhere about it being used only short periods of time.  I feel like um being tricked into giving up my meds. Anyone have any advice!?!? Thanks! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Lol wow that's crazy I was a huge drinker during my early 20s then I quit cold turkey. It was stupid. Soon after that I got into opiates more than I did when drinking a ton I guess to fill a void.  Point of my story is when drinking I was an embarrassing sloppy obvious mess. On opiates nobody could tell a thing. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think the DEA is trying to make people use heroin by tightening up the regulations and restrictions when it comes to controlled substances (mainly opiates).  As someone who used to personally have a decent script for opiate painkillers I was eventually cut off for no reason other than being told that the DEA is watching very closely now and bye bye.  No mention of my body and what I will do now to combat my pain.  So what'd I do?  Go to the street and get heroin  I am just 1 person so I am positive this has happened to many many people already and its just the start.  I am on methadone now because I don't like the junky lifestyle and hustling every single day, waiting on you dealer, getting bad cut drugs, legal risk, robbed, beat up, dying, etc.  I feel that being on methadone right now is the best option right now but it will never touch how well I had it before. I never expected to have my script pulled out from under my feet like it was. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> i'm in a similiar situation. been skating since i was a little kid and my bad spots (every skater has at least one) are my ankles.  I used to blow them out all the time so damn badly that I bruised up to my sock line and down to my toes.  I went to a podiatrist and he recommended surgery but I don't really want to do that now since I am still relatively young.  I still skate but I always wear these good ankle braces I found at Walgreens. They have hard plastic around the brace and they lace up.  Really good support.  You should check em out if you still have wobbly ankles. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I can't agree more!!  When things started to get rough with money and as my tolerance was building I was in straight up hustle mode for I'd say a bit longer than a month, but looking back at it, that time felt like six months.  It was the same thing everyday: wake up and hopefully have something left in the house to get me going then it was off to try and make as close to $100 because I'd usually like to get as much as I could at a time. I'd makey money mainly scrapping metal or recycling but where I live those methods aren't extremely efficient due to people recycling there own shit to make money themselves and just lack of finding .material to scrap.  I cannot see how people can do that shit for like 10+ years but I see them at the clinic I go to. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Either of those won't show up as a benzo if you were wanting to know that. Hydroxyzine is like benydryl. Ironic since I just got prescribed these a couple days ago

	<TEXT> When I tried to quit, the first time I tried suboxone and it just didn't hold me over enough.   After giving up and going back to using again I wanted out for good so I tried methadone. I was worried at first since I thought that if this doesn't work I have no other options.  Well I am in MMT for about 3 months and I and pretty happy with the results that methadone has given me.  I could write a ton more about it and answer more technical questions if you or anyone starting or about to start cares to pm me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well its really random how they do it so there isn't much a way around it ha.  Just use right after you have been tested is the best way.  Hey i'm not even a subscriber here!  Never knew you had to subscribe or anything but I just tend to post in opiates more than any other subreddits. Is it recommended to subscribe?   </TEXT>
