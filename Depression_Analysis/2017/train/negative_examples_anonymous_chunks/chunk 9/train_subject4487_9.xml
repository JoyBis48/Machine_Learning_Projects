	<TEXT> I've yet to sell anything and I'm buying a bit of everything (from generic to semi-numi) so when I do sell, I can see what various items fetch.  For example, will a tube of American Silver Eagles have been a better buy than a tube of generic Buffaloes? Do I get spot on a 10oz Geiger as well as a 10oz OPM? Could be I should have doubled down on the OPM bars, won't know until I try to sell.

Keep good records of what you're paying for whatever you're buying.  Reference that when you sell, that can drive future purchases. </TEXT>

Been with them for around a year, I guess.

I've not had to go through any claim process with them, but then my record is pretty impeccable (one minor incident in literally 27 years).

Highly recommend them if you're not a big driver. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Nothing seems to ever go right for him

I don't see how you can say that. What do you know about the guy?  He's had the recent bad APMEX/USPS stolen and now a USPS misdelivering to a PO Box.  He has a lot of videos up so it seems a lot has gone right for him.

I found him via his APMEX story and I'm glad I did. He's bringing to light and reenforcing what we should all be cognizant of when buying/selling non-locally.

I felt for him in regards to the APMEX scenario.  The latest issue I don't feel so bad for him, though, as I outlined his two mistakes (at least IMO) in my OP up top.  I still think hjis experience is worth sharing here. I'm surprised so many seem to be brushing it off as he's just a whiny bitch.

I'm curious how you would handle the situations he's had. You wouldn't reach out to the stacking community in some venue? </TEXT>

Mentions he sent two separate packages in a trade deal. Two separate packages because it wouldn't fit in one priority mail package.  This was mistake #1.

Mentions "this was not a cheap trade, I would have been out quite a bit" but he cheaps out and didn't send it registered with proper insurance. This was mistake #2.

No mention of what happened to the 2nd package (at least I didn't seem to catch it).  Seems to have been left with "it's out for delivery" despite it being delivered to the post office (box).

This guy can't catch a break with USPS lately.

**Question for you guys selling over at /r/pmsforsale, how are you shipping? What are you doing re: insurance?**

I've had three or four phone screens with other companies during that time, but I never asked them if they looked at my github, I only ask at the end of in-person interviews.  I don't interview in-person a whole lot, though, I'm somewhat selective, meaning I don't go on in-persons just because they've asked me in.

From my (limited) experience, it doesn't matter at all.  I'm not target the startup world, though, so that might make a difference. </TEXT>

Let me answer your question with a question:

Would you prefer no train at all?

Thats basically what it comes down to when your train shows up and theres only one car instead of two. At least *something* showed up.

I can *personally* respect and appreciate their "hey, fuck you" blunt response, but their PR could use a little polishing for the masses. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> IMO, they're essentially treating some of their inventory as loss leaders, buying feedback if you will, trying to get that power seller status so people keep coming back, new people come in with confidence they won't get hosed.  I would imagine they'll be raising prices in the future.  Not all of their inventory is a deal, as well...They have a kilo Koala for $598, both APMEX and Provident are around $30 cheaper, I think it was when I compared.

I've had a good purchase through them, though their shipping is slow if you're on the west coast.  Didn't get tracking until the 3rd biz day after the buy-it-now.  UPS Ground is 5 days coast-to-coast, so 8 day shipping for me. </TEXT>

This got me to thinking, **what have we actually solved through philanthropy**? The amount of money that's gone into philanthropy over centuries has to be just mind boggling.

This isn't asking about research/better quality of life, yada yada yada, that kind of stuff...What has actually been solved by philanthropy? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's Java.  

ECMAScript 6 (ES6) introduced classes to JavaScript (ECMAScript is JavaScript if you're not aware). The caveat being ES6 classes are syntactical sugar over the objects and prototypes devs are used to when working with "classes" in JavaScript.

Here's an example of an ES6 class (not a function in sight):

    class View {
        constructor(options) {
            this.model = options.model;
            this.template = options.template;
        }

        render() {
            return _.template(this.template, this.model.toObject());
        }
    }

We're interviewing front-end devs where I work and over the past month we've probably done phone screens with 10 candidates. Only one could talk about ES6, the others couldn't tell me one thing about what's new in ES6. </TEXT>

Every try to quantify to your pinhead boss how much $ you're wasting with your obviously shitty interview process?

Over the phone he claims that it should only take the candidate about 20 - 30 mins to complete.

Have your boss take it. Where is he coming up with this time frame?

I feel we've lost a lot of potentially great developers due to this

You have. On the bright side, at least you guys are just doing bullshit work all day long since you don't really need another developer. Also, by the time you find a developer who is up to snuff as per your boss, that framework he passed the test in will be deprecated. </TEXT>

Don't worry, though, you'll soon enough progress to "I think I no what I'm doing". Shortly thereafter, when crunching the financials of the stack, you'll be back to "I have no idea what I'm doing". Be sure to throw around some "smackdown" and "powers that be" and "JP Morgan" and "the banksters" and "to da moon!"

Also, don't forget gold.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Couple of thoughts, take them for what they are:

* I don't get graded coins from a modern run/mintage of 1,000,000. There is probably a ton of 69s out there (they may not be graded, but you're looking at a large mintage that could make it to the graded market).
* I agree with /u/Cantilivewhileim that a MS70 would be "worth it".
* The crocs are sold out at the mint so dealers are jacking the prices.  [SD Bullion is asking $26 a coin](https://sdbullion.com/silver/perth-mint-coins/2014-australian-saltwater-crocodile-silver-1-oz-bu-perth-mint), for example.  I didn't do any other comparison shopping, I just knew they had them in stock as I was browsing them this past weekend.

If you like it, grab it. 20 looks to be not quite $23 USD so it's a good price, I suppose. I picked up a tube last year, I like them.

	<DATE> 2015-06-16 05:11:16 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Casual gamer here, looking for some Steam Summer Sale recommendations.

Skyrim is my favorite game. I'm actually replaying it right now and it's still as beautiful as I remember it. I don't even fast travel. Or take a horse.  Nope, I run the entire map. What I love the most about it is the open world aspect, which makes is not a linear game. It really is an adventure. I also love that you get a lot of game play out of it.

My last game purchase was The Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion. I picked up the game of the year edition and holy fuck I played that for MONTHS and MONTHS and MONTHS. Really enjoyed that as well, same reasons as Skyrim.

Also played State of Decay which I thought had a lot of potential to be an amazing game but it was just too short.  I still really enjoyed it, though. Good game.

I have some shoot 'em up games, including zombie-types, but I'm looking for more Skyrim'ish type of games to look for on the Steam Summer Sale.  I'll also probably look for a Skyrim expansion pack or something as I think I just have vanilla Skyrim.

Would love some recommendations from you guys with tons more game-play experience.

My PC runs Skyrim with no problems. Video card fans kick on, but no problems with the game play and it loads fast. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That is some amazing footage and the stupidity of humans never ceases to amaze me. Incredibly dangerous situation to be filming that. If the deer managed to spring away that dude could have been the next target and bears are actually pretty fast runners.  I would have run inside, grabbed my 30x06 and would have had a new rug on the way.  The last thing you want is a bear hunting in your neighborhood.

Does anyone know where this took place and the rest of the story?  I'm guessing Alaska but not so sure with the "call somebody" by the videographer at the end.  Alaskans are pretty smart about this kind of stuff, but maybe it's the first time at the vacation house, lol. </TEXT>

Be sure to keep your receipt from BGASC so you have the provenance.  THAT will help more than keeping in a sheet.  This, of course, assumes BGASC is still around when you go to sell, or a buyer remembers them if they're not still around. </TEXT>

Fill up your order cart and see what it says for shipping.  I think it tells you the carrier.  You can add/remove stuff to break $ thresholds and see if the shipping carrier changes.

You could also email them. Their rep posts here so maybe he'll see this and respond.  I'd go through a mock order cart first.
