	<TEXT> I fap because I'm a guy and I want to have sex 24/7. Not because I'm an insecure person who has gone through the some mental shit. Come on This isn't a drug addiction It's a physiological drive. 

(Sorry for being a douche cause i know you spent a long ass time writing that, but I think you're maybe missing the point If you were super happy and stuff, maybe WITH a partner to have sex with all the time, you'd probably have the same drive. NoFap to me is about transmuting this intense sexual desire to creating a more amazing life.)  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I mean... After about 30 seconds it's not painful. And you should go for more than 30 seconds. Also, cold showers are great if you're trying to get in shape. They force your body to burn more calories for the rest of the day because it has to raise your body temperature to combat the coldness.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think the show The Biggest Loser is psychologically damaging and super fucked up, yet everyone on the show and everyone who watches it parades around saying THEY'RE SAVING THEIR LIVES. As somebody who used to be obese, I know how hard it is to get in shape, and when I watch shows and read articles about Fat Shaming I can't believe I even lost the weight. People would lose the weight easier if they weren't constantly being told how inferior they are because they aren't a certain weight. Let people make their own decisions. 99% of people who are overweight know it's not healthy. You don't need to make them feel bad about it. It's only going to make it worse.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Trying to find the name of an old SNES game... </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-11-18 03:54:40 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So, I only got to play this game once when I was a little kid and I remember thinking it was ridiculously fun. I always thought it was called Quest, but I've searched online and I can't find any information about any SNES game being called just Quest, theres Mystic Quest and Palladin's Quest but I kind of doubt that either are the game I'm thinking of. The only thing I can tell you to remember what it was was that it was a kind of fantasy game where near the begining of the game you have to figure out a sort of card trick. My older brother kept playing it and I think there was a part where he got a special flute that he played to summon something inside a castle. I wish I could tell you more, but it looked like a zelda / pokemon game Where you have a small character, move up/down/left/right and you talk to people and you read what they say. If this sounds like any game you know of I would love to know cause I want to buy it. I always think about it randomly and how badly I wanted to play it when I was a little kid. Thanks in advanced.  </TEXT>
