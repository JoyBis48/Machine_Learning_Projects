	<TEXT> The easiest way for me to do it would be to make everything a picture, even the dotted lines for people to write on. That way you can copy and paste, and if you make the text wrapping "In front of text" then you can place them where ever you want and not have to worry about formatting. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ok, what I did was just adjusted the latitude of the lines using tab, then right clicked the picturetext wrappingin front of text. This allows you to place the picture where ever. Just format your paper how it would look without pictures, then add pictures using the above instructions. Hope this helps. </TEXT>
