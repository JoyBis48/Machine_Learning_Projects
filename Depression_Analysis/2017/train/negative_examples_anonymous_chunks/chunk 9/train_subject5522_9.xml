	<TEXT> I totally agree. I think there's zero chance they abandoned this research. The video isn't disinfo per se, the people piecing together the story of MKULTRA back then were working with what they had, and I regard this as an interesting timepiece because it shows that the press was interested in these issues in the late 70s. Proof that they didn't get rid of their programs is the Army's [SERE program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival,_Evasion,_Resistance_and_Escape) which has an "anti-torture" manual that teaches soldiers how to resist torture. It has the consequent effect however of teaching people what to do if they actually want to torture. A lot of SERE and modern interrogation programs come out of the MKULTRA era. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Joe Rogan tried to make a case for DMT. I wouldn't put him in their league, and I don't think he's trying to be them, but DMT: the Spirit Molecule was interesting if you haven't seen it. Other than that, I'm starting to see a resurgence of research into using  MDMA and even LSD in helping people suffering from PTSD. I doubt that there will ever be the same kind of psychedelic free for all that people witnessed in the sixties, but I do think that these things will make their way back in therapeutic settings. There is a sizeable community of people discussing psilocybin, not only how to cultivate it but also swapping experiences with it. Terrence McKenna's brother Dennis is still active and in fact writes for Reality Soup. Reality Soup isn't a bad forum for these things if you don't know about it. As far as a new Tim Leary, do we need that? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't think psychedelic research will ever go away. It's too weird and fascinating to get buried. Terrence McKenna was great. I have a lot of time for people who got into that kind of exploration but at the same time I'm skeptical of the context that surrounded their research. Another person to read, if you're interested in stories set in sensory depravation tanks, is Stanislaw Lem. He wrote a Polish psychedelic sci fi masterpiece called Solaris, but his short fiction is also incredible. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would say it all comes down to individual lazymindedness. But that is very likely going to describe the individuals who constitute the majority of the population at any given time. Reason and rationalism are the path out of sleep. The path in is unreason. Which is not to say the forces of unreason are unreal. Sports mania and crowd psychology in sports stadiums is a great example of this. A crowd cheering has a demonstrable effect on the performance on the field by the players. This is down to belief, which is effectively a psychological state. But I would be careful in calling psychological states or beliefs unreal. Like Robert Anton Wilson said: reality is a set of beliefs waiting to be replaced by another set of beliefs. </TEXT>

Texas has always been a very nasty place politically and the oil and gas industry on the one hand and construction industry on the other (Halliburton and KBR) are rumored to have  histories full of murder and intimidation. Here is a posting about an early Johnson linked murder, not the only one: (http://educationforum.ipbhost.com/index.php?showtopic=6005)

An earlier incarnation of KBR built all the roads, buildings, bases, and airstrips as well as supplying most of the supplies for the entire Vietnam conflict. Johnson had been their boy since the 40s, and the company's shady history reads like the Godfather. </TEXT>

Certain individuals will always be able to think their way past the traps that get set up by the powers that be, but a large chunk of the population will get sucked in.

	<TEXT> I feel like there's a real distinction between natural substances like psilocybin and synthetic ones like LSD. I'm not judging people who like LSD, and I've taken it myself in the past, but it seems very possible that it manipulates mass behavior in more or less predictable ways. A great example of this -and I'm really not saying this was a conspiracy or that it was even a bad thing - was the use of ecstacy in England in the rave scene in the late 80's. The drug became popular with football fans and basically wiped out hooliganism and violence between supporters.
As for hypnosis, it's like propaganda, it doesn't work as well on individuals as on groups. However MKULTRA was trying to target individuals. They only ended up destroying people's minds. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think that was because the landlord that owns the buildings around Zuccotti Park had to sign a lease on the park allowing people to use it 24/7 which wasn't the case anywhere else. That was a loophole that delayed eviction for a few weeks, where the police had power to remove protestors from other parks including Washington Square. In fact, they did remove people from Washington Square whenever the police decided they might be trying to set up shop. There was a lot of discussion about moving to Washington Square park but most people were scared of the police reaction. There was at least one general assembly there which I went to.

Also, one funny fact, almost nobody at Zuccotti Park knew that Adbusters started the protest! </TEXT>

Henry Luce controlled a lot of media back then including Time and Life magazines and he LOVED LSD. Luce publications were the same ones declaring that 1967 was going to be the  "Summer of Love" and encouraging young people to go to San Francisco. The underground press thought that was insane and realized it would be a public health catastrophe. As for television and movies, lots of them began to adopt psychedelic themes, especially Star Trek. And Timothy Leary was after all something like a televangelist. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's part of a series of docs Jon Ronson did called "Secret Rulers of the World". One part was on the Bilderbergers and is great because he gets into a low speed car chase.
Here's a link to one of them: (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQKTMjApnkI) </TEXT>

Something exactly like this happened to my friend in Nigeria. She "donated" all her family's possessions and cars to two thieves after they'd rubbed some powder on her skin. Scary shit! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's no joke. Check out this article by sportswriter Dave Zirin who learned through a FOIA release that his anti-death penalty group in suburban Maryland had an undercover FBI agent going to the meetings even though it was a small group (apologies for the Huffpost link, usually try to avoid it)

	<TEXT> I have a lot of time for Jon Ronson, who happens to be good friends with another great documentary maker, Adam Curtis. Ronson was actually there. This doc got me to get off my high horse thinking people in the militia movement were "nuts". I disagree with them about a lot of stuff, but they're far from nuts. If I'd been at the roadblock to Ruby Ridge while the authorities were shooting at this poor family, I might have woken up sooner. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This goes deep. Montreal was a center of CIA activity and research since they felt secure being outside of the reach of the US legal system. A lot of Canadians had their lives taken away from them. Cameron wasn't some run of the mill quack either. He was head of  both the Canadian and World Psychiatric Associations in the 1950s and 60s. </TEXT>

He was getting set to move along, but the cops couldn't stand having something happening that they didn't get to control. I mean, what kind of people are against a dude playing the Star Spangled Banner on his guitar? They're like cyborgs. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks for that. I mean, I'm all for paying taxes, but if it is impossible to ever have a lifestyle where you can't avoid taxes, then that means you're being taxed by the very act of your being born. We should have some possibility of opting out if we don't use services taxes pay for. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The Danny Casolaro story, like Gary Webb's,  is simultaneously inspiring and frightening. It also gets to the heart of why it's hard to expose so many of these conspiracies. They get so convoluted and expansive that it can be insanely hard to comprehend let alone explain to other people. I think I'll post some of this stuff later. Know any good Mae Brussell shows dealing with reservations? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Wounded Knee was messed up. It's also confusing because in addition to the FBI, wasn't there also a problem with local organized crime that had hijacked the reservation? Reservations are exploited in a lot of ways by the federal government. The Cabazon reservation  in California was used by the US for bio-chemical weapons research well into the 80's since federal mandates prohibiting such research don't apply on reservations. Probably still is used for that. In exchange, they were given a casino. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've actually become interested in this recently because I'm seeing a neighborhood near me undergo gentrification. Right now, it's in the happy early stage where drug dealers are being evicted. Pretty soon however, it's inevitable that lower crime and new residents with better education and salaries will cause property taxes to rise. This is going to force out most of the decent working people who've had to put up with the criminality for years. I'd like to discover some workaround to help those families from inevitably being moved out of their old neighborhoods. </TEXT>
