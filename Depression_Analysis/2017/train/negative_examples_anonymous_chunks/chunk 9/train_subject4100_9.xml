	<TEXT> I completely get your criticism. It gets me a bit agitated looking at as well, sometimes, just because I question whether it has any composition at all. I was trying to evoke the same feel the book cover for The Lost World gave off.

Fragments... ahhh, never again. (That app was such a guilty pleasure the first week I got it.)

I'll get to work on a printer-fiendly version of that resume, too. Really appreciate your response! </TEXT>

A bit of background on the serious faces. The picture of my grandfather was taken right after he was in the middle of a huge accident. As far as my dad can remember, he had a few broken ribs, and he was getting treated around the time this was taken.


...My picture was taken before I left to study for finals. But that's a story for another day. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sorry for the double response - just needed to add something. I see what you're seeing with the fat chin thing. It's drawn like that because his face is supposed to be looking to his left. This wasn't a portrait of him from the side.

The way I worded it is slightly off from the original - it was how Jack Nicholson's character quoted it in The Departed, where I was remembering it from.

My portfolio's at [maazcon.com](http://maazcon.com). And then there's an [Instagram](http://instagram.com/maazcon) with the same handle - I update those two the most frequently. I'm still in the process of finishing the layout for the portfolio itself so hopefully it's running smoothly.

More stuff like this will be under the "Artwork" page!

	<TEXT> I was about to do that! The reason I didn't was because I wanted to try my own take at it - basically imagining what I'd make the tagline if I was the one in charge of marketing the movie. I do that with most of the posters I make (it's almost like a fun mental exercise).

I'm glad you like it. :) </TEXT>
