You're going to need to get into the piping and clear what's blocking it.

Their should be another drain in the middle of your bathroom floor, is the water overflowing from there? If not, its the pipe from your tub to that drain.

If the water won't drain from the tub, its too late to pop in a pipe cleaner liquid like Drano, you'll need to clear the blockage. 

You may need to get yourself a snake (whatever you guys call it in the US) and break down the blockage. </TEXT>

Be prepared for it, one handed use is a No, full day of battery won't happen.

I have a work phone as well as my personal, I can choose any phone I want, I HATE iOS, but for my work phone I use an iPhone 6.

I'm on the phone all day, including push emails, and the iPhone will die at 9pm from a 7am disconnect of charger.

The Nexus 6 at the same use would be dead at 3pm.

Get the Galaxy S6 edge and install the google launcher. I would've done the same but the S6 didn't exist at the time. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Dripping isn't all its cracked up to be for me, you take away all the convenience of vaping. 

You need to carry a bottle of juice with you and keep on priming the coils.

Flavour and clouds are good, but not good enough for me to drip full-time.

I have the subtank mini as well, and the flavour and clouds are brilliant, even better than the Kayfun I use. The only reason I prefer the Kayfun is because its tiny in size as I have the Bell-Cap on it </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yup, I've been through the ranks where you kick off with an evod, then you get your regulated Vamo, then you chase power and clouds which gets you on RBA's / RDA's and a mech mod, I'm now at the final stage of settling with an istick and a cloupor.. That's it for me.

I don't need or want a 5909w unit to fire a stupid quad coil, Jean zipper, rip tripper build.

Kayfun, single coil micro, .8 ohm on a regulated LITTLE unit is all I need. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you have bought organic cotton specifically for vaping, don't bother.

If you have cotton from a chemist etc, I boiled mine. 

Some say flavor is better and others say it's to get rid of the treatment chemicals etc, I boiled a handful of cotton, strained all the pieces like a big ball in my hand them spread them out to dry in the sun. 

That handful will last you forever as you only need a fraction of a cotton ball when wicking.

As for coiling over a screw? No good.. How will you slide the coil of if it's stick between the threads?

The aim of the game is to have it tightly wound with all the coils in a perfect row together. When you fire the unit, the coil should glow from the middle then out to the edges perfectly. 

Kanthal is ready to rock straight off the roll, you'll fire it a couple times when you first build it, that will burn anything on there, straight off.


Get yourself a subtank mini from Kangertech.. It has coils that are pre-made, and gives you the option to build. This tank goes toe to toe with my Kayfun </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I use 28g coil, 7 wraps over a 2mm drill bit gets me approx .8-9 ohms. 

It's technically 'sub ohm' but not really. Flavor and vapor is perfect for me at 18w.

Depends what you're using to fire the tank, you won't need an ohm reader. 

I have gone through all the units including multiple mech mods, now I'm sticking with an istick 30w and a cloupor mini as my all day drivers, both have an ohm meter built in.

Pm me or reply here and I'll try answer any fiddly questions for you from my own experience.

As much as the internet bashes Rip Trippers, his tutorial on basic coil building is all you will need. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Larry's humour is still great, but you're right, it's very dry and at times a bit risqu.. Where Jerry's humour starts to trend towards slap-stick (well sort-of).

Both brought a lot to the show in their own way, but Kramer developed into an even better character once Jerry took control. </TEXT>
