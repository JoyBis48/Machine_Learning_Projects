	<TEXT> While I don't know what was going through the pilot's mind or what his orders were when he fired...

 They knew it was a civilian aircraft, they wanted to wave their dicks and shot it down.

...I'm pretty sure that the USSR could have found some more effective and less lethal way to wave their dicks around. After all, downing civilian airliners is not a good way to generate positive PR.

 Also gonna need some citation on an RC-135 being in the area, because I'm fairly sure you just made that up

When our propaganda organs started their narrative about the downing of the KAL airliner this facet of the shoot down was at times denied, and at other times ignored or buried. Now long after the USSR voted to break itself up, it is admitted and talked about.

A source?! For one, try actually reading the Wikipedia link/article that you originally posted. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Make sure you omit the fact that a US RC-135 intelligence aircraft was also in the area and the Korean airliner strayed over some of the most sensitive military areas of eastern Siberia.

If you include facts like those some may wonder if it was some sort of ruse to trigger Soviet air defenses and have the US spy plane record all of the electronic data.

After all, [we would never deliberately violate Soviet airspace to spy on them with aircraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1960_U-2_incident) and then *lie* about it, right?

But the reality is that the US uses solitary confinement as torture. For example, to persecute former Black Panther [Albert Woodfox](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=Albert+Woodfox+solitary+confinement), he was held in solitary confinement for *more* *than* *40* *years.*

Early in our republic the US was famous for *lenient* sentences for criminals. Quakers invented the penitentiary, a comfortable room with a bed and desk, at a time when Europeans were still literally throwing people into dungeons.

Let's remember, the US government broke an international agreement to hold elections to reunite North and South Vietnam because the CIA reported that the communist leader Ho Chi Minh would win any free and fair election.

The US government lied to the American people and the world about the [Gulf of Tonkin incident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Tonkin_incident) to start the war, backed a Catholic dictator in Bhuddist South Vietnam and then waged a war which resulted in about 3 *million* Vietnamese being killed.

No, the worst thing one can accuse China of doing is building/expanding islands in the South China Sea and making loans to many countries to develop their infrastructure.

This is yet another article promoting the US' new (renewed) Cold War. Its purpose is to teach people to think in binary military terms, and demonize China and to paint them as a US "enemy."

	<TEXT> Sure, [Wikiquote says this is from](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Smedley_Butler) a 1935 socialist newspaper "Common Sense."

Butler is a fascinating but almost forgotten hero from American history.

Most Americans recall Congress' "House Un-American Activities Committe" as being the platform for Joe McCarthy's anti-communist witch-hunt during the 50s, or the 1960s when Vietnam anti-war protesters called in front of the HUAC mocked the entire proceeding and made a laughingstock out of the HUAC.

But the HUAC was founded in the 1930s to investigate the fascist coup d'etat which Butler blew the whistle on.

Being a popular and highly decorated general, Butler was approached by a group of industrialists who wanted to overthrow the US government, create a fascist government and to put him in charge as their figurehead (the so-called "Business Plot"). But Butler informed the Roosevelt administration about the traitors and caused FDR allies in Congress to start the HUAC.

Butler's famous short book "War is a Racket" should be required reading, but few have ever heard of it.

Today, the US Marine Corps issues out a suggested reading list of famous Marines to indoctrinate young Marines in training about the heritage and valor of the USMC. Despite Butler being 1 of the 2 most highest decorated Marines, needless to say Butler is not on the Corps' suggested reading list. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>   the US most definitely did decrease spending after the Cold War.

Despite the graphic from a rightist source, as I said previously, I agree that for a few years Clinton did allow inflation to eat away at the "defense" budget. 

I see the core of what you're saying is that after decades and decades of wasteful military spending, and a shrinking percentage of world GDP, the US was forced to shrink cut is carrier fleets and dream of fighting two major wars down to reflect economic reality.

I don't disagree. Many history books have been written about how excessive militarism has wrecked the economies of empires and have lead to their decline. We're not an exception to that rule.

We saw it most clearly during our war on Vietnam. LBJ's years of deficit spending had many impacts. Social Security spending and its tax was merged into the "combined federal budget" to try to hide the costs of the war.

Nixon's expansion of the war into Cambodia and his deficit spending finally lead to countries openly questioning the solvency of the US dollar. France even went so far as to send a warship to the US to collect France's gold (a warship that returned empty). Nixon was forced to detach the US dollar from the gold standard, thus saddling succeeding presidents Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter with the ensuing inflation caused by Nixon's move to inflate away the massive costs/debt of the war.

Bush's strategy of launching multiple wars and *cutting* taxes at the same time was sheer economic insanity.

With such a love of war, it's only common sense that we would eventually start paying an economic price and to be cutting back on the size of the US military.

 Hence, even with the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan wound down/done,

Done? Don't you mean *lost?* The US Army's War College long ago rendered their verdict that *both* of those wars were strategic defeats for the US. Spending *trillions* on such adventures with no economic benefit to the US simply quickens our decline.

 there is shift back to high tech equipment.

Shift or not, it hasn't meant that US wars around the world are any more successful, though the shareholders of the military-industrial complex probably have a different definition of "success."

 "In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex. The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists, and will persist." -- President (and former General) Dwight Eisenhower, Jan 17, 1961. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't know what your point is. Clinton did not *cut* the so-called "defense" budget. He only allowed inflation to eat away at it.

Let's remember, the gigantic US military was sold to us for decades after WWII because of the "threat" of the USSR and communism.

But there was certainly no dramatic spending cuts despite the fact that the Politburo of the Communist Party of the USSR voted to break the USSR up into over a dozen countries that then became capitalist; the Warsaw Pact, which was created in response to NATO, was abolished; and Russia allowed the reunification of Germany, and then peacefully and voluntarily withdrew hundreds of thousands of troops from eastern Europe. In short, our enemy evaporated and became capitalist -- but NATO still exists and US military spending was barely impacted.

Yes, military spending increased after the 9/11 attacks and the month-plus-long series of anthrax attacks of 2001.

Considering Kennan's quote above, was the reason for that increased military spending because we had succeeded in *inventing* (Kennan's word) a new enemy?

What seems crystal clear is that the real reason for the massive US military spending after WWII was *not* because of the USSR and the "threat" of communism.

	<TEXT>  US foreign policy has always been pretty much about supporting the most stable political entity in a region,

US foreign policy is about supporting governments that will (a) follow American orders on important geo-political and economic issues, and (b) allowing US/western corporations free reign to run rampant in their country.

 It has nothing to do with supporting democracy or human rights etc. Its all about the economy...

Aside from that "following orders" point, I completely agree. The US would prefer some neo-liberal "democracy" to rule, but you're right: It's not about any of the moralistic rhetoric that is the PR propaganda. As we've proven many times, the US government has no problem working with brutal dictatorships or fascists.

We've seen this recently when the Bahraini dictatorship shot unarmed pro-democracy protesters and admitted to widespread torture. Obama had no problem at all supporting the Bahraini dictator and supplying him with the weapons to commit his crimes. </TEXT>
