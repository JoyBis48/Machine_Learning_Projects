	<TEXT> They are not dropping in price THAT fast. For example I bought a 480GB Sandisk SSD from Amazon in December for $179, and when I look at the same drive now on Amazon and Newegg, it's around $170. 

Be happy with what you have, as it's completely normal to watch prices drop after you buy the latest and greatest hardware. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Whenever it happens, and if they are cheap, I suspect birth rates in developed countries will plummet. Especially for individuals outside of a marriage/long-term relationships.

Many of the guys I know who had kids when they were in their 20s did so because either they didn't want to wear a condom due to reduced sensations, or because their girlfriends forget to take the pill (or in some messed up situations told them they were taking it, but actually were not).

I'm hopeful that a pill would help reduce unexpected pregnancies across all populations, but for some of those that don't use their brains, I can't see them popping a pill everyday when they can barely pull their lives together. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was in the hospital for almost a month in 2012 and my bill from the hospital itself was $174,000. But for the life of me I couldn't figure out where it all came from. The labs/imaging bills were separate, and when I talked to the billing department they weren't sure how to make sense of everything either... I had a bill for the same thing from two different providers. It was a clusterfuck.

Thankfully insurance saved me. But holy hell it seems like it's a headache for everyone involved.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is also something I've searched for in the past. There are not many services out there because regardless of the service you need to have the other person's bank data and/or they need to sign up for an account somewhere (paypal/etc) which is too much work to ask of customers.

A lot of banks have easy ways to send out electronic checks, and I've found that is the simplest. I also use something offered by Chase called Chase Quickpay. The recipient still needs to sign up, but they only sign up once and the money gets transferred directly to their bank account in the future. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Modern Turkish history is full of coups, there were two successful coups not long before the one in 1980. The 1980 coup would have happened regardless of American involvement, and based on previous history it was almost guaranteed that it too would be a successful coup... so I don't think the US can be blamed for causing such a change, as it was inevitable.

Erdogan's biggest fear is of his military leaders, and he has been cracking down/removing senior leadership. When Turkey goes too far in the wrong direction, the military usually steps in. </TEXT>

* What's the location?
* How much time are you willing to invest?

* What kind of skills do you have?
* Do you have income outside of this 40 grand?
* What's the least amount of profit you'd be happy with say 5 years down the road?

It's not a simple/easy question. There is a lot more than money involved when it comes to creating a successful business. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's why I blamed the "scientific publication community", ie: the publishers. If well-known respectable publishers don't enforce quality standards equally across their publications (conferences included) and don't hold publishers they partner with accountable, it's a fault that should absolutely be addressed, but it doesn't seem to be. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's precisely my original point. In this example, both IEEE and Springer are very respectable in the community, but they and other publishers don't apply their review processes in a consistent manner to identify fraud. And in cases where fraud research is found to have been published, they should make the changes to address it. I don't see indications of that happening. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They were not scam journals, unless we are thinking of different incidents. This is the incident I'm referring to: http://www.nature.com/news/publishers-withdraw-more-than-120-gibberish-papers-1.14763 . Though I wouldn't be surprised if there are more. The publishers included Springer and IEEE, both of which are well trusted publishers:

 Ruth Francis, UK head of communications at Springer, says that the company has contacted editors, and is trying to contact authors, about the issues surrounding the articles that are coming down. The relevant conference proceedings were peer reviewed, she confirms  making it more mystifying that the papers were accepted.

 The IEEE would not say, however, whether it had contacted the authors or editors of the suspected SCIgen papers, or whether submissions for the relevant conferences were supposed to be peer reviewed. We continue to follow strict governance guidelines for evaluating IEEE conferences and publications, Stickel said. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I read it. I'm not suggesting just the journal itself should have caught it, but rather that the 'research' became so prominent across media and people in positions to correct the misinformation didn't really question it. 

It's not just infamously bad journals publishing fake papers, it's been a problem with other journals as well. A couple of years ago a CS team at a university created a paper generator and submitted the papers to some well known and generally trusted journals, and the papers were published even though they were non-nonsensical.

	<TEXT> If the scientific publication community didn't quickly identify this as a sham or even questionable, it makes me wonder just how many papers are published that contain false research where the author(s) **didn't** want to get caught. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It took me a year of searching for houses and making offers before I had my offer accepted (and only because the previous investors who had their offer accepted backed out). That was in February, and I paid around $450k for the house, which is not very far off from what the value estimate was on Zillow. Now 3 months later the value estimate is $530k, and a fixer-upper house down the street just sold for $500k. It's an absolutely crazy market right now. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The issue here is that energy weapons are banned via "international rules of war" against enemy personnel. So laser attacks against infantry would be 'banned'. IMO the military should just do it anyway to reduce collateral damage, but a superpower ignoring international weapon conventions would not set a very good precedent.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I wish the US government would change our Middle Eastern policy and give more recognition to the potential benefits of an Iranian ally. Though it's very far from perfect, Iran is actually very moderate now and is far more in line with our principles than other allies such as Saudi Arabia. If we were to base our friends and foes upon principle, Saudi Arabia would be one of our top enemies.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Most family farmers need subsidies to survive and be able to produce food for others. The ones that don't need subsidies are the big corporation farms (usually created by buying out family farms). I wish more people understood this... Family farmers are not getting rich off the government. Even with subsidies most still struggle.

	<TEXT> Though at a certain point the composition of the atmosphere would take effect, the primary factor behind tree lines is temperature. At a certain point it becomes too cold for the species to survive, or there is too much moisture that remains as snow cover for them to get started.

The atmospheric composition statement can quickly be debunked by comparing altitudes of tree lines across different regions. In tropical and warmer climates you'll find trees at much higher altitudes (in many cases all the way to the mountain tops), where as in colder climates the tree lines will generally be much lower. If the primary factor were atmospheric composition you'd find tree lines across the world were much more uniform in altitude. </TEXT>
