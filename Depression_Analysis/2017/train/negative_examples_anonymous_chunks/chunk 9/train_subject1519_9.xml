	<TEXT> I had scabies too 7 yrs ago and it honestly changes your life for the worst. Fear and anxiety def take over. 

Had a coworker tell me that her daughter just got back from a scabie infected region and my body activated all of its defenses just at the word of it. I hate scabies! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am going through something similar and I would highly recommend seeking a therapist.

I have been going for a year and though i havent fully recovered I am at a point where I can somewhat function better in life. 

One of things that I keep hearing about for improving recovery is Mindfullness/meditation. Still learning about this while being careful to not get into some eastern religion tantra. 

Cardio helps out alot with depression. Go for a walk or exercise and you will see improvements.

	<TEXT> The way to get out of a burnout is to take pleasure in life.

Some ways to do that :
Make real connections with people. Hard to do.
Find fun things to do. Play sports, games, movies, etc.
Workout. Minor achievements till you're on track.
Being positive.

	<TEXT> Not an expert nor even an amateur. So take my suggestion with a grain of salt.

My lawn is for the most part in a crappy situation too. So I also got fed up with it and called a local landscaper.
He is going to dethatch, aerate, apply a mix of blue kentucky grass seeds (maybe in your case apply bermuda grass), and then apply fertilizer after 6-8 weeks.
So those are the steps to recover it seems. </TEXT>
