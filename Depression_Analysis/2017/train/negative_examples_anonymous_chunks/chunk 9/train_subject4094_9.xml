	<TEXT> No you shouldn't be eligible for a refund.  This is the risk you take with airbnb.  If you want hotel accommodations get a hotel.  You found three cockroaches so friggin what.  I had an ant problem at my house for about a month, we live in a world with bugs, deal with it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yep, I have clear pictures of my home and how it lacks a lot of decor and I'm a bachelor which should give some insight into how it is decorated.  Don't matter, people still complain about how empty the house is. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You get that on any region specific subreddit it's obnoxious.  Hey I'm visiting Vermont?  What should I do?  Well look at the history of the past 300 times a person has asked that and you might have a good idea. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Got any links about the profit statement?  The only reason I would think Airbnb isn't making a profit is because they are focused on putting all their revenue into funding growth. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No way.  First off take what the previous poster said with a grain of salt they take third review system very seriously.  Second as a host I set my own prices so I'm not really an independent contractor like uber or homejoy.  Airbnb is more of a marketing platform for short term rentals that you pay a fee on for each reservation. </TEXT>
