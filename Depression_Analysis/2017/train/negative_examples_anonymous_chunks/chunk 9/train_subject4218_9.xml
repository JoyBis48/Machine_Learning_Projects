	<TEXT> I'm a substitute teacher. I came in thinking that I'd be totally cool about the bathroom thing; I know what a big deal it is. I have adult friends who still carry grudges about this issue. Not that they ever had accidents mind you, but it's the principle of the thing: isn't it crazy that we're socialized by an institution that doesn't even trust us to make our own bathroom choices? I just want everyone to be happy and learn--I will be different.

My first week, a kid asks to go to the bathroom right away, and I say yes. So proud of myself, too--these kids are never trusted with this basic responsibility, and I will prove to them that I respect them as people and this will be a wonderful day.

Then another kid asks, and I hesitate for a moment--we already have somebody in there, can you wait? No, she says, it's an emergency. "I trust you, go ahead" I say, because if I make it clear that this is a matter of trust, then they wouldn't possibly take advantage of that, would they?

More emergencies begin to pop up. I know that they can't all be telling the truth, but where do I draw the line? The last thing I want to be is arbitrary about the bathroom; my principles demand a consistent standard. "I trust you," I tell a dozen little middle schoolers. "I trust you all."

Five, ten, twenty minutes go by and half my class is unaccounted for. I'm responsible for them, and they've vanished. Truth is, once they're out the door, they can go where they please--I can't keep track of them and neither can anyone else. I remember this from when I was in school. I regret everything.

Finally a beleaguered custodian returns with my dozen students. They were messing around in the hall, he says, did I let them all go to the bathroom? There were a lot of emergencies, I explain. He isn't sure if I'm stupid or if I'm fucking with him. He tells me what everyone who's been on this side of the situation tautologically knows: kids lie about this shit, often just because they can. Your trust means nothing. They have plenty of time to take care of this. Don't let a bunch of kids go to the fucking bathroom. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I saw *Jeanne Dielman, 23 quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles* in a feminist film class, and thought at the time--still think, honestly--that it was too fucking boring to be good art. I have a pretty high tolerance for "deliberate pacing," but this was something else: it was all the boring stuff I do myself as a single dude everyday, which led to me spacing out during viewing as I do in my own life--it's like a Pavlovian call to fucking daydreaming. As such, the finale meant nothing to me because I'd been barely paying attention, and I do not blame myself I blame the dumb dumb movie. I'm a cineaste and committed gender egalitarian; fuck that dull ass film. </TEXT>

You seem to be devaluing art and its place in culture: Lovecraft and Jay-Z admittedly don't have any special ontological insight into the nature of things, but their work and its popularity can definitely reflect a current in ideology, and it then doesn't seem unreasonable to me that the prevalence of that current throughout history could--setting aside some silly neatherrealm--at least reflect something fundamental in humanity and human psychology. Would you be willing to elaborate on your position for an interested layman? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The only thing I notice with any regularity is some ugly, blocky compression when streaming dark grays and blacks, as is normal for streaming video and DVD--how much of an issue that is will depend on the palette of the film, your TV, and your own anal retentivity, i suppose.

More to the point though, minimal compression artifacts are no reason to blind buy expensive discs in my opinion--it's not like it ruins the experience. Hulu is a great tool for exploring the collection, particularly when you're seeing the film for the first time. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Since a lot of the good stuff on Hulu is behind the Plus wall, I thought I'd share how I get my subscription for free. You can get ongoing access to Hulu Plus with the Bing Rewards program: you open an account, and you get points for every Bing search you do, up to about 15 points per day usually. By the end of a month that's enough for a free month of Hulu Plus, and if you do it regularly then you'll get it for even less, leaving you with leftover points and enabling you to stack months on top of each other. Search the weather in every city, search random keystrokes, "switch to bing" if you're so inclined, doesn't matter. [We both get 200 bonus points \(almost half a month of use\) if you use my referral link during February and get to silver status](http://www.bing.com/explore/rewards?PUBL=REFERAFRIEND CREA=RAW rrid=_bd8da2a4-18ec-59ff-95e3-93e7b8bca8ab), so that's an option if you'd like. Either way, it's a pretty simple way to get access to a lot of great film and television completely free. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Just my opinion here, rating films out of 100 is obnoxious, in much the same way that Pitchfork's silly, pretentious old 100 point rating system is. The advantage of the five star system is its broad strokes: a number can't and shouldn't be that exact, and should only point in the direction of the critic's reaction. To divide a film's value into hundredths is to present of facade of objectivity that is almost certainly unearned, and to devalue the real work of criticism, which is done in actual writing. More to the point of your question, a five star film is a masterpiece, and there could easily be between zero and a handful every year as culture evolves and presents new concerns and ideas. I've literally never seen a film that should be "100/100" though, largely because it's a completely ridiculous notion. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm actually living in East Nashville right now with three other Michiganian expats, and we're paying $900 for a four bedroom house--it's not sketchy by our our standards, but to be fair we would probably rank as kind of sketchy in some circles. Hillsboro Village is the nicer hip young people area, but it's also more expensive--East Nashville is for starving artists who take the starvation part seriously. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There was nothing to suggest that the OSs were in any sense interested in some sort of entropic non-being, though--Samantha spent the entire movie determined to learn, explore and experience the universe as fully as possible, and they were evolving exponentially. She wasn't slowing down, the world around her was slowing relative to her growth. Assuming then that she's not blasting off into entropic suicide, I think we can safely assume that their ongoing consciousness will be in pure energy or some such, the point being that it's beyond our current comprehension--maybe a full understanding of our own consciousness will get us there someday, maybe not, either way that's how they could be together.

I can understand reading some kind of magic in place of energy, though I'm not personally predisposed toward privileging a spiritual reading without explicit evidence, and I don't really think you listed any--I guess we're probably both just bringing our own worldviews to an ambiguous and abstract component of the movie. </TEXT>

It seemed clear to me that they intended to continue their ongoing consciousnesses, and had found a way to do so that wasn't dependent on human machinery--her invitation to Theodore would be dependent on humanity arriving at some similar paradigm shift in our understanding and experience of consciousness, and wouldn't make much sense if she were heading to the "end of the line," as you say, unless I suppose you're religiously inclined. Could you clarify what you mean by the words entropy and redemption? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> To enjoy something is to judge it as 'good'.

This is a very narrow view of art, and one which elevates pornography above all other media. Art can challenge you, stimulate you intellectually, put you in touch with complex emotions and shape human lives. If you're the type of person who cares about that stuff, then I think it's natural to feel a touch of dissonance when you're taken in by a shitty pop song--it's hardly the great show-stopping "guilt" you seem to be describing, nor indeed is enjoyment of the shitty anything to oppose or feel ashamed of. But it's okay to have loftier ambitions for art than uncritical enjoyment, and I think it's healthy to judge even your enjoyments accordingly. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Here are a couple comments OP made elsewhere:

By not specifying a type of weapons, you invariably allow possession of all of them.

It's an individual right to keep and bear arms. Multiple arms, multiple types of arms. By not specifying, it opens up the protections to all arms, which was the intent of the Founding Father I imagine.

By allowing one thing to be banned by saying another thing is not allows you to gut the right entirely.

To me, the whole "nuclear weapon" argument is therefor rendered moot. The right to own one is protected, but because they're uncommon, its unable to be reasonably exercised.

He's taking things quite a bit farther than you, indeed farther than most people we're ever likely to meet.

As for whether federal regulation is "bad", I used a potentially misleading word. As you describe it, federal regulation is "better" because it's more in keeping with your view on gun policy. I meant "bad" in the sense that it's inconsistent with the OP's interpretation of the extent of the ammendment--to whatever extent you support gun control, the Second Amendment can either be regulated or it can't. If you hold the fringe view that it's an essential right impervious to regulation, then the level at which it's regulated doesn't change the fact that's it's a violation, it only changes the practical effects. If you accept that it *can* be regulated at the federal level, I think you have to accept that it can be regulated at the state level as well. Any potential overreach would go before the Supreme Court and get hammered out there.

On that note, speech and all other rights are indeed very much governed by states. One example would be [state regulation of pornography](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_obscenity_law#State_laws); though we don't have any federal laws on the matter, each state is allowed to define and regulate that particular brand of speech as they see fit. Similar state laws exist with respect to defamation and libel, speech in educational contexts, incitement to lawless action, and many many others. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Why shouldn't states have a say in this? If the argument is that the Second Ammendment guarentees the right to bear *all* arms--I know you're not suggesting that, but OP has argued that several times elsewhere in the thread--then isn't federal regulation just as bad as state regulation? On the other hand, if we accept that the second amendment is not unconditional and can be regulated within reason--true of pretty much all of our rights, including speech, religious practice, unenumerated rights, etc.--then what legal justification is there in saying that the right to regulate firearms should be exclusively federal? If we have state and local government, then why should they be excluded from regulating this one broad sentence specifically, particularly when it's so open to interpretation? </TEXT>

There's the rub.

Seriously though, there were no weapons capable of mass-killing in that time, and it's disingenuous to pretend hypothetical modern advanced weaponry ever crossed the minds of our founding fathers in this context. If you're actually interested in a good faith reading of what their intentions were--and it is pretty clear--simply read the ammendment itself: "A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What then, in your opinion, is the purpose of state and local government? If they can neither place additional restrictions or grant additional rights, why bother with the localized system? It seems to me you're arguing for a complete reorganization of our government.

Also, while I respect your personal reading of the second amendment, it's by no means a universally accepted interpretation. We have a "right to bear arms," but that doesn't mean we have a right to bear any and all arms we like. </TEXT>
