	<TEXT> I'm getting hives all around the area (underside of my forearm), up to my armpit and down across my stomach. I didn't see any caterpillar, so it's still undetermined exactly what it is. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I brushed up against a canvas car top carrier and got a bunch of like little black hairs stuck in my skin that started to burn two nights ago. I'm guessing it's from a caterpillar since I've had reactions from them before, but never have from poison ivy. </TEXT>
