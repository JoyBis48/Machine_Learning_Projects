	<TEXT> I am not sure it would cause mass panic. Sure, it would cause a massive amount of stir, but why panic? Some religious groups would go out of their way to deny that, conspiracy theorists would have group orgasm, plethora dank memes would be spawned, but nothing that would affect everyday life in any way.

I just don't see that much happening.

	<TEXT> Yes, I have.  I am a brony, and I know people who have their rooms full of merchandise (i don't), but that doesn't mean they're creepy (most of them are kind, friendly people, who just enjoy it). If they ever do some doll photo op like this, they do it in jest.

That said, there are people who are actually mentally unwell and delusional about their waifus (the word is also mostly used ironically) - I recall one who was **really** possesive about one of the characters and had all sorts of fantasies about their mutual love and was jealous of others liking her, really argumentative about it; was allegedly also physically violent toward his classmates -, but that is more of an exception. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree. And there are two more reasons I stopped playing. 

1. I am a chicken, so I played on Peaceful. But on Peaceful you can't craft many items because there are no materials that only come from monsters. (it was more than a year since I last seriously played MC, so correct me if I am wrong)

2. There are so many craftable items, but there is no ingame documentation. I get that it is meant to be discovered by the player, but I think there should be ingame wiki for those that want it. The need to have MC wiki open in the browser ruins immersion. </TEXT>

I think if more people read Carl Sagan's books, the world would be a better place. Basically everything he ever wrote was a gem, full of wisdom, challenging the reader to think about their own prejudices.

	<TEXT> Humans are not born with developed bullshit detectors. If they don't know the criteria by which to judge if something is true, or if admitting they are wrong would contradict their deeply held beliefs, people will happily believe bullshit. Consider people who believe even the most credulous things (New Age woo etc...) without equally strong evidence.

People also do some pretty dumb stuff. Even if 50 % of the stories on the subreddits like /r/FloridaMan , /r/NewsOfTheStupid , or /r/offbeat were fake and the other 50 % true there would still be quite a few some pretty dumb stuff people do.

Have you read /u/MyLifeSuxNow's story about his bitch wife? Afaik in the end settled Reddit found out that it is made up when people were pointing inconsistencies in it. And yet, it wasn't a very credulous story, I could totally see that happen. I thought it plausible, so I believed it until other people called BS. No big deal, it was just a funny story anyway.

And it is by no means the only example of me being fooled by a story and it most probably won't be the last. Hell, I even believed some of the more known conspiracies when I was younger and less educated - I think it's important I remind myself of it every so often, just to be more compassionate to other people. I am not perfect.

BTW  with "there is a real contingent out there who literally wants to "kill all cis white men"" part you reminded me of something I heard in one podcast, where the podcaster gave a story how he and some guy with a different opinion fiercely argued over the internet and called each other names, yet when they incidentally met IRL they laughed at it and had a reasonable civil discussion. I think most people would also be civil in such a situation. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I struggle to learn to be more civil on the internet, as there is always someone who doesn't know something others do or who can't recognize something to be fake as well as others. We've all been there.
