	<TEXT> Yeah i use this: http://imgur.com/TOvn6ij over bleached hair, and it's a permanent dye so that's 6-8 weeks before it starts getting brassy. I bleach my roots and use this all over every 6 weeks - 2 months. I love the look but yeah it's terrible for your hair! I use a hairmask daily... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have platinum blonde hair and use bleach to take all the colour out and then dye it 'extremely light ash blond' which puts a more white sheen on it. That second box is definitely dye and not bleach, but yeah that's not gonna do anything to take the pink away. </TEXT>
