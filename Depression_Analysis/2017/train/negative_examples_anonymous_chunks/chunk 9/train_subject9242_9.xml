	<TEXT> I was going to drop food in the top and drain out the bottom into the yard.  I live in USDA zone 10, so it would be plenty warm.  I could cut the top open or add a hatch of sorts if it was too small.  I even planned on just dumping an adequte air pump down the top. 


Would something like this be too crazy?  The rest of the family doesn't want a pond in the yard.  I will keep the stocking rate something healthy for the fish, and I think in reality it could provide a very safe and healthy environment.  I was going to probably have a water change rate of 10-20 percent a week, and drain the bottom into my surrounding yard.

	<TEXT> The situation of owning a home.

If you can get a decent differential between renting out your main place and renting an efficiency, it can be a pretty sweet arrangement.

I know that couple, and even though they do not need to do that because of fiscal hardship, it is still a really great way to monetize their home.

Just look at how much your house would rent for vs how much you could rent a one bedroom for.  

I know you live in a cheap COL area, but I know people that are grossing an extra 2k/month from this if they have a nice house.  That would give you a lot more cash flow and equity on your home, even just in a few years. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was just asking as your username sounded foreign. 

I would speak to your school counselor ASAP if you are struggling. 

Many times people are melodramatic about being outed, but if you think that your parents would hurt you or kick you out, do not come out until you have finished college. 

You are going to make it through this. Just hang in there. 


Also, dont get busted or outed via your reddit account. Set a passwordon your phone and laptop.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Knowing how to fancy up home cooking is the way to go.


The markup for most restaurant food is insane. Even a simple greek salad of lettuce, olive oil/vinegar, olives, and feta cheese is like 4/5 dollars. 

Even if you eat a lot of convenience foods, the prices are still easily half that of restaurants.  </TEXT>
