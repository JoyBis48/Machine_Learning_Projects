	<TEXT> I was shoulder pressing 65 pound dumbbells once and a pretty large dude was lifting with his friend next to me. His friend told him to go grab 50s but he was watching me and must have thought since he was bigger than me he should be doing at least 65 so he grabbed those instead. He couldn't even get them up. Felt good. </TEXT>
