	<TEXT> Thanks! I'm getting some more fish soon, I just need to get the chemicals right and let the bacteria build up to keep up with more ammonia from more fish. I'm still very new to fish keeping so I don't really know what kind I want but I have a great local store which will give me some great fish next time I'm there. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> His cheek bones look more prominent and he's much happier. We should stop focusing on how much weight he's loosing but rather that he is making an active effort to make a lifestyle change and needs our love and support. Who cares if Woody may have cherry picked a bad and good photo to use, they are giving their moral support and that's what matters. </TEXT>
