Vaughn did a lot of great work until Wedding Crashers was a hit and then he became the go to schlub next door and churned out crap like Four Holidays, Couples Retreat, Fred Claus, The Watch etc.  

She's being pushed into wacky broad comedies (Identity Theft, Tammy, Spy) when she's actually a talented actress. (Gilmore Girls, Bridesmaids, St Vincent.)

	<TEXT> That sucks. When I was teenager, my hair was a big part of my identity and, as I slowly lose it, I feel a real loss of control over my body. It's not vanity, it's just a sense you can't make decision about how you look.

I can't imagine what it feels likes at your age.

If you've still got eyebrows etc. I would consider growing a beard. All my female friends agree that that look is fucking hot. 

If that's not an option, I'd look a various hat options but I would try and avoid making it look like you're trying to hide it. 

Depending on your head shape, have a look at glasses as an option to break up your face.

	<TEXT> Hipsters discover music, food, fashion and make all the stupid mistakes so we don't have to. 

They're mostly harmless, at worst snobby but usually quite friendly.

Why all the hate?

TL;DR Answers from the thread.

1) They are pretentious and snobby toward non-hipsters

2) They a parasitic, consuming instead of creating.

3) They create small, exclusive cultural ghettos.

4) There behaviours are based social pressure and not real love or passion for a topic.

It's the same story told in Lolita and, to a lesser extent, American Beauty.

	<TEXT> I loved the original 1988 Bourne Identity with Richard Chamberlain. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDA0K_dIhxk

Ocean's 11 has all but killed the memory of the Rat Pack original.

The 1978 Invasion of the Body Snatchers is way better than the 1956 original.

Same with True Grit, The Fly and John Carpenter's The Thing, that all outshine their 1950's originals.

There's also a tonne of French films that have been surpassed in popularity (if not quality) by their originals. True Lies, The Bird Cage, Three Men and a Baby and Down and Out in Beverly Hills.

	<TEXT> Some form of religion is practiced by the vast majority of this planet. The idea that, regardless of the validity of their beliefs, that those people get no sort of benefit from their rituals and practices is hard to believe.

These rituals, ideas and beliefs were not created by a magical man in the sky but by real people with real needs and desires. 

The stories we tell and create reflect who we are as people. The evil that religions do is created by people, as is the good.

	<TEXT> I never said the movie wasn't any good! It always though it was a brilliant piece of satire.

I'm sure the redpill and MRA douchnozzles are trying their darnedest to find some sense of male identity. But, like so many douchenozzles before them they are doing so by creating an imaginary enemy. 

In my day, you just jerked off and played Doom until three in the morning. But these pricks, that's some tyler durden level delusion. 

EDIT: Never mind. Had a look at your profile. I didn't realise how deep down the rabbit hole you were. I hope you find some peace in the world and work through your problems without hurting too many people along the way. All best.

	<TEXT> I always thought it was a satire, poking fun at modern masculinity and consumer culture. Today, in an age of MRA and redpills and rapey frat boys it is more relevant than ever.

But I know so many young men who take it seriously. Much like the stockbrokers who love Wall Street or gangsters who quote Goodfellas.
