	<TEXT> Looks like a HF vertical antenna of some sort.. Perhaps something for the 80 meter band?  
  
(I'm a licensed HAM operator, so, I'll just leave that right here :-)  )  
  
  
(P.S, Could possibly find out more, and even ID the make and model of antenna over at /r/amateurradio) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The soundtrack to this movie (T. Reznor, and A. Ross) is wonderful as well. Perfect ambient tunes to listen to when coding, or writing. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Crap..

Just missed it..  
  
  I'm in Sheboygan, and only a 3 hr or so drive from there.. Got all wrapped up with the work stuff a full week early, but already have my ticket home tomorrow.  
  
  
  Should have told them I needed to stay out here another week, and driven out there to check out the B B, and shack.. :-) Maybe make some friends, and finally find myself an Elmer!! :-D </TEXT>
