	<TEXT> Back when I was a Christian, I attended a Pentecostal Church, and even then I was suspicious of speaking in tongues.  But at that church the pastor had said there should always be a translation of the person speaking in tongues.  So there was designated time during each service where people were suppose to be "led by the Holy Spirit" to speak in tongues.  Someone would stand up stand up and speak gibberish: Assata ma ta ta ta la bella.  Then another person would stand up and speak the "translation": "Go forth my people, leave Gilgal..."  It was always conveniently on topic with whatever the church was talking about at those particular weeks. </TEXT>
