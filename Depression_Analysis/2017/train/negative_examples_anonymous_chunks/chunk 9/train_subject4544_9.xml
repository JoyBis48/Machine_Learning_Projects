	<TEXT> I can relate to how you felt although my situation is different from yours. I've never been brutally bullied or harrassed before; however, it was the pressure and stress my parents put on me along with loneliness plus several other factors that drove me into a depressed, suicidal state. My "friends" did nothing to help, in fact they just kept excluding me from their activities which only made the situation worse. My parents didn't even seem to know that I was depressed; they just kept saying things like "you have to have over a 4.0 GPA and at least a 2200 SAT score otherwise you're a failure". Aside from that, I wasn't allowed out of the house unless it was for something EXTREMELY important and I couldn't watch T.V (my mom even canceled cable) or see any shows on the internet. I was expected to work and do well in my studies so I could grow up to be a "successful person". I felt like I was being ignored by my friends and locked in a cage by my own parents. Nothing really seemed to excite or make me happy anymore (much like the numbness you felt) and soon after I was thinking about painless ways to commit suicide. I knew my parents would be sad but at that point I really didn't care anymore. The only thing that stopped me from actually committing suicide was how much of a hassle and pain the ass it was to kill yourself.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've always been kind of a recluse throughout the majority of my teenage years. Most of the time I'd just stay at home and play games or just work on homework and stuff by myself. I never really had a chance to hang out with friends. Then, starting in senior year, I decided to join my school's cross country team. Even though it was tough, I enjoyed it a lot and I got to meet amazing people. If I had a chance, I'd go back in time and convince my 6th grade self to do a sport. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> And how would you know that almost everyone who has watched the NBA finals the last few years have watched it to see Lebron lose? My point is that the main purpose of sports will always be entertainment which includes rooting for your favourite team and overall just enjoying the sport and the players. It's not focused on drama. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Everyone has an opinion, that doesn't necessarily mean thats the primary reason why they watch the sport.

 not because they're big fans of the team or the sport, but because they wanted to see Lebron lose

I beg to differ. Majority of the people I know still watch basketball let alone any other sport for the entertainment value, not some shitty drama.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ummm... I'm sorry but I don't think you've seen a lot of the drama that goes on in major league gaming. I'm mostly referring to popular games such as League of Legends, Hearthstone, CSGO, or maybe even SC2. Just because on the outside it may seem like some lousy video game and not a real sport,  there's still competition. Where there's competition, there's always drama. I don't think you should belittle video games when you don't even remotely know a lot of things about it. </TEXT>

Also keep in mind the place where you're sticking your meat rod into is also the same place where the person's shit comes out of. You're essentially rubbing your dick in her poop. </TEXT>

For guys, why the fuck would you want to shove your dick in another person's butthole?

For girls, why would you want a dick in the place your shit comes out of?

	<TEXT> I had sex ed in high school and middle school except sex ed in middle school was basically the really simple male and female anatomy. They also talked about puberty and reproduction but they never mentioned anything about actual sex. It was quickly after I entered high school that I actually became aware of what a condom was and how it looks like. I think it was 10th grade when I recalled this event and I was able to use my new found knowledge to conclude that the box was a box of condoms. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> During the summer of 8th grade, I was getting ready to go on vacation. The night before, I was packing my bags and all that was left was my passport. I asked my Mom where my passport was and she said it's in the bottom drawer in the nightstand. I go to her room and I accidentally open the middle drawer which contained a box full of condoms. At the time I had NEVER seen a condom in my life so I thought it was some medication my dad was taking so I took the whole box of condoms to my mom and I asked her what does my dad need this for. My mom immediately grabbed the box and went back to her room to put it away. She then gave me my passport told me to get out of her room. For the next year every time I tried to ask her she would always change the subject. It wasn't until a few years later when I figured out what that box actually was. </TEXT>

The problem is I won't be able to visit her because she moved all the way to Florida and I live in New Jersey. To make matters worse, she probably won't be able to come up over Christmas either so it might be over a year or two before I'll be able to see her again. It really sucks having a loved one move away from you. Since she's the only sibling I have, the house now feels so empty without her in it. I just walked into her empty room a few minutes ago and I felt like crying.  </TEXT>

The Kawai Complex

Golden Time

Oregairu

They're probably my top Romance Animes excluding Angel Beats, Clannad, and Anohana because those are the mainstream ones.

Edit: Wow. I just double checked you've seen every single one of those as well. We seem to have very similar anime tastes! If you don't mind movies I would suggest Hotarubi no Mori E, Garden of Words, and 5 Centimeters Per Second. Those are really good romance! </TEXT>
