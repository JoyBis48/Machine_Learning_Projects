	<TEXT> That's a big argument my friend group is having right now. On one hand, 3D can be distracting. On the other, this is a HUGE movie and a really important first-time viewing experience for us hardcore Jurassic Park fans. IMAX 3D, maybe? idk yet. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am so FUCKING horrible at the battles! I was stuck on Level 9 for like three weeks. I've been having to invest a ton of time into planning out my next battle because I realized I needed a new team, but of course it takes FOREVER for me to get enough meat   coin to level anything up! Now I'm out of DNA so I can't buy any more dinosaurs so I can evolve the ones I already have! GAHHH it's so frustrating, fuck this game. Give me Operation Genesis 2. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm really hoping that we've still seen only very little of this movie. What if the T-rex vs. I-rex scene is only halfway through the movie, just like the T-rex scene is halfway through the first Jurassic Park.

Ah, I doubt it. A boy can dream. The marketing on this probably has shown a clip from every scene of the movie. </TEXT>
