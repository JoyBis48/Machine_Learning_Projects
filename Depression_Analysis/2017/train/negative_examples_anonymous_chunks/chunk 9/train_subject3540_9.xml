	<TEXT> Had an Cardiac MRI done today for check up, but in the machine when they started the scanning my head started to explode like somebody was pinching me with a electric stick right in my brain and my brain stem. I wear a Reveal LinQ recorder that is MRI friendly. But when reading the technical manual it says do not use the local transmit coil, [Here a link to the technical manual](http://manuals.medtronic.com/wcm/groups/mdtcom_sg/@emanuals/@era/@crdm/documents/documents/contrib_188127.pdf)
But they did use it in the MRI i had the big thing on my chest.

I was wondering how can you get these electric shocks in your head during MRI is this normal? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> University Leiden has a uitzendbureau where they are working together with. 

[A link to JobMotion!](http://www.voorzieningen.leidenuniv.nl/jobmotion/werknemers/werken-bij-jobmotion.html)

This is what I found, maybe the flexpool is interesting, you have to be available for at least 12 hours a week. 

But if I where you I would look for a job in the same profession where you are studying for at the moment.

	<TEXT> We have this in the Netherlands also! Especially in the smaller villages and we have a lot but seriously a lot of AED's placed everywhere, train stations, city centers, neighbourhoods lately you see them seriously almost everywhere also in the small villages you see them more and more because they are more then 15 minutes away from the ambulance post. If I would live in the US I would do it in community level, everybody pays 10 dollars and you can buy one. O and if somebody calls 911 for a cardiac arrest seriously all police, ambulance and firefighters in the area are racing like crazy to get there as quickly as possible here is a example:

Sometimes they also send a helicopter with a doctor in it specialised in trauma's and who can perform certain surgical procedures on the street.

	<TEXT> Het blijft idd nog een tijdje hangen, misschien is praten met een psycholoog een optie, zij weten vaak goede handvatten te geven. Je zit natuurlijk ook in een soort rouw proces, dit slijt er vaak uit in verloop der tijd. Is natuurlijk niet niks om een vriend te verliezen op zo een jonge leeftijd. 

Bel maandag gewoon even de huisarts hij kan je sowieso verder helpen. Misschien is het ook een idee om er is met je vrienden over te praten wat er is gebeurd misschien ben je niet de enige in de vrienden groep die het hierdoor moeilijk heeft gekregen of is geschrokken.

Succes. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Sad about my health :( </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-06-06 03:31:18 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm sick for the last 2 to 3 years, it started with racing heart rate 195 bpm first conclusion by GP: "panic attack" I said i'm not scared nor am I in panic but they didn't listen because I was young (21 at the time) and young people can't be sick. I kept telling them my heart acts weird it goes to slow and to fast nah that's all anxiety (hmm slow heart rate with anxiety)? So for 1,5 years this went on and on every day I asked the GP for a referral to a Cardiologist in Holland this is the way it goes a GP needs to refer you to a Specialist. Instead she said no you need to see a psychiater and work on your anxiety I still said i'm not scared but well I was at the point to except every help in the world because I felt so sick. So i was put on Anti depressants surprise surprise they didn't work, they only made my slow heart rate much worse. Kept telling them my heart rate is getting to slow (38 bpm fully awake, dizzy almost passing out) nah it was still anxiety, you are making this up or you can't count, they told me I that i had a very severe case of anxiety so they putted me in the Psychiatric Hospital and they thought I was absolutely fucking crazy. My mom and dad shocked to death because I was always such a nice kid and very realistic. After 3 weeks I certainly knew I wasn't on the right place and asked my mom and dad to pick me up.

Later my mom kicked me out of the house because she couldn't handel it because my GP kept saying nah he is lazy and needs to go play sports it's all in his head, she asked my dad if I could stay at his place. We haven't spoken for 6 months but we are slowly working on it and we are meeting once a week now.

We are 1,5 year further now then first my first time racing heart experience, I changed GP and he referred me to a Cardiologist and Endocrinologist: turned out my Pituitary Gland was inflamed an my cortisol was way way way to low and I had Severe bradycardia and now last week I heard my echocardiogram(ultrasound of the heart) showed that my heart muscles is getting weaker and showed there is damage in the muscle something called Akinesis or something I need an MRI in 2 weeks to see how bad it is, but in general those things aren't really good when you are 23. 

I have seriously NO CLUE how i'm still a life, sometimes i can't even think or remember where i was 5 minutes ago and walking a stairs absolutely get's me out of breath and I get massively light headed. 

I want to get off my chest that I feel extremely sad and I lost complete confidence in my own body and mind because I didn't stood up for myself in the beginning.
 
O and fuck you to the so called friends that aren't there when you actually need them, lost a lot of friends. 

So now i'm gonna be sad again and sit in a corner and cry a bit more thinking back of the horrible 2/3 years I had.

But back on topic:
Klokhuis, Journaal, Jeugdjournaal and maybe some cartoons you have in Asia also where you know the story line from already, that would make it a bit easier. </TEXT>
