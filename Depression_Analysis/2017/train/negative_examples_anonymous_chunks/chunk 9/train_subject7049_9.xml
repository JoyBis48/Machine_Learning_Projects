	<TEXT> I was outside of my garage one day and this dog walks in to say hi.  Looked very similar to Mr. Lady,  matted up like crazy, and she seemed really thirsty.  This dog looked like she had been homeless for months.

So I got her water, checked for tags, no tags.  Took her to the closest vet to check for a chip, she had one!  The owner lived 5 houses away from mine.  

I was happy to return her to her family.  When I got to their door, they didn't even know she had gotten out, and they weren't even that excited to see me with her.  It felt wrong leaving her with those people. 

I should've helped that dog.  OP, I just wanted to share that story, but I think you're doing a great job.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It can be really hard to make these kind of people feel your pain.  If he has a victim complex, you just really have to know how to approach your conversation.  

It's hard to baby them, but I feel like you'll get through to him more if you make a point to recognize the little sacrifices he makes, then discuss your struggles.  I feel like that makes all of your strengths and sacrifices more measurable, he needs to really see *all* you do.  It does take the role of a really strong woman, your kids are lucky to have you.  

I feel your pain.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh wow, I'm so sorry.  

Does he throw tantrums once in a while and text/say stupid stuff, or is his disdain for you just mounting and mounting?

I'm not too sure how your mom is, but if she is offering to help you more, I'd take it.  You really sound like you're reaching a breaking point, you need to let the ones that love you help you.

He definitely needs a kick in the ass and start contributing more to your family.  If he can make 3 kids, he can help raise your 2 kids.  It sounds like you're having to be the strongest person all the time, and I know that is tiring.  

Try to see things through his eyes.  It must feel like shit to not be able to provide for your family.  Maybe he's taking a little longer to feel really paternal and maybe he's resentful that he can't act youthful and free.  

I have no sympathy for him, but seeing through his eyes will at least help you communicate and hopefully resolve some of your issues. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I live in Vegas, and every time there is/was a show, I'd go straight to the venue and wait in line there for tickets.  I would never give in to Ticketmaster prices.  Out here I never encountered a venue that didn't sell directly to you.  I think I would have boycotted the venue, fuck Ticketmaster. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The people that gain large amounts of weight, or people that sustain a really high, unsafe weight usually consume such a large amount of calories that they *can* make a huge weight change by limiting calories.  But I agree that it is more healthy to maintain a balance of both consuming low calories and exercise.
