	<TEXT> Here's a good starting point: http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/282/1810/20150791

From the Discussion:

 For most vertebrate taxa (possibly excepting naked mole rats), the patterns expected under the social brain hypothesis are relatively straightforward: group members will face an increase in socially imposed cognitive challenges as social complexity increases; this should be matched by a similar pattern of increased brain investment. We suggest this is true because of the fundamental way vertebrate societies are structured: vertebrate social groups are ecological contexts where individual reproductive agendas are pursued [8]. As social complexity increases, social interactions play a greater role (relative to other ecological factors, such as the needs to forage and avoid predators) in fitness variation. Social prowess may even become a predominant selective force on cognition [8,9]. Social conflict probably plays a major role in these patterns.

 There is an important difference between vertebrate and insect societies in how social complexity arises. Simple vertebrate societies are often family groups, but larger vertebrate societies comprise increasingly distant relatives or even collections of non-relatives. This is not true of social insects: excepting unicolonial invasive ants [50], most insect societies are family groups. Changes in insect colony size and social complexity involve modifications of family structure, with a general trend towards increasing individual specialization and division of labour among group members [18,19]. In some senses, insect colonies can be viewed as extended phenotypes of the reproductive(s). We found evidence for a marked decrease, rather than an increase, in MB calyx investment that accompanied the origins of sociality in one social insect clade. Our data further suggest the most important transition was from solitary life to simple societies, with further transitions in social structure having no measurable effect on brain architecture. This pattern indicates super-organismal attributes, such as distributed cognition, arose early in social evolution among Vespidae.

Other than that, I don't know much about cognitive evolution. If anyone has any insight, I'm particularly interested in how cephalopods (octopi and squid) fit into the social spectrum, even though they're pretty smart--and more interestingly, independently evolved intelligence from the bird/mammal line. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Idk, the machine learning/artificial intelligence community have developed reinforcement learning algorithms that do basically just that. Backpropagation of rewards to learn which of a given set of behaviors to use when confronted with particular inputs is not that hard to do, we have algorithms that can learn to play video games these days through trial-and-error. So personally, I don't think that's a good example of being "really smart". The kinds of learning behaviors we haven't been able to emulate in ML/AI are abstract reasoning about the world that can be use for inventing behaviors or things like having a theory of mind for navigating social dynamics. Those are beyond our ability to code, and I think are better examples of being really smart. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There's a great article in Quanta Magazine about recent research in bird evolution: https://www.quantamagazine.org/20150602-dinosaurs-to-birds/

An excerpt: 
 A bird didnt just evolve from a T. rex overnight, but rather the classic features of birds evolved one by one; first bipedal locomotion, then feathers, then a wishbone, then more complex feathers that look like quill-pen feathers, then wings, Brusatte said. The end result is a relatively seamless transition between dinosaurs and birds, so much so that you cant just draw an easy line between these two groups.

Note: I should say that he's not suggesting birds actually evolved from T. rexes, it's a figure of speech. </TEXT>

 Amina Abdallah Arraf al Omari was a fictional character or hoax persona created and maintained by American Tom MacMaster.[1] The identity was presented as a Syrian-American blogger, identifying herself as a lesbian on her weblog A Gay Girl In Damascus and blogging in support of increased civil and political freedom for Syrians. During the 2011 Syrian uprising, a posting on the blog purportedly by "Amina's" cousin claimed that Amina was abducted on 6 June 2011. This sparked a strong backlash from the LGBT community and was covered widely in mainstream med

	<TEXT> How does "selection" being a *sub*component of "natural selection" make linguistic sense? I assert that your term "selection" is an ill-defined colloquialism. What the second component in your list should be is "differential reproductive success" or "differential fitness". It doesn't even make sense to call it "selection" because that term has colloquial connotations of a conscious entity making some kind of choice based on an undefined property, it has no place as a formal term in evolutionary biology. "Selection" is not specific enough of a phrase to describe what it actually is. The whole point of calling the process *natural selection* is to suggest that nature itself, without conscious intent, can also "select", as an analogy to selection, which connotes intention. And when evolutionary biologists refer to a concept called "selection", it always is shorthand for "natural selection" unless otherwise specified. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Natural selection is the process by which the environment selects which organisms reproduce.

This is false. Natural selection is the partial evolutionary change due to fitness, genotype covariance. It concerns the differential inheritance of genetic characters from one generation to the next due to fitness differences. Look up Price and Ewen's interpretations of Fisher's Fundamental Theorem of Natural Selection.

Differential reproduction that is not due to fitness differences does not count as selection. An environmental event which kills a random proportion of a population regardless of their genes is just another example of genetic drift, which is the part of evolutionary change due to neutral random sampling. Your "plain natural selection" is a colloquialism which does not exist as a formal term in evolutionary biology. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Don't know why you're getting voted down. Fisher's fundamental theorem of natural selection, as interpreted through Price's equation, equates natural selection with the partial evolutionary change due to fitness, genotype covariance. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Evolution is not linear. It's a branching process.

Also, what is a "type". That's a subjective category, and therefore the idea that "types" only turn into new species of the same "type" is not meaningful because it is a statement about things which are not properly defined. That should immediately clue you in to the fact that the statement is untenable, and that there are major gaps in your conceptual understanding. So my answer to the question, is there proof that species of a "type" turn into species of a different "type", is that the question is ill-defined. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The 2C target is basically impossible to achieve at this point except in the most extreme mobilization efforts. The train left 5-10 years ago. But from a public relations and a political policy standpoint, no one's gonna officially move the target to a more realistic 3C or 4C. 2C is the agreed upon goal between nations, and there's a risk of nations abandoning efforts all together if anyone tries to move the target upwards, which may result in a worse outcome than sticking with the already agreed upon but now ultimately unattainable goal. Maybe not, but no one's taking the risk of trying to get nations to agree on a *new* goal.

tl;dr The 2C target is more political than scientific at this point. </TEXT>
