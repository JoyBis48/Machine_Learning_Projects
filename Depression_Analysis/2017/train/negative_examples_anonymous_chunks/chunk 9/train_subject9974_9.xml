	<TEXT> Hey y'all, not sure if this is the right subreddit. I am looking for a charity/ nonprofit to volunteer with and donate to, but I'm having a helluva time wading through the sheer volume.. I thought maybe y'all could help?


I am an Army vet with combat experience,Does anyone know of a charity that I can volunteer with to teach/promote literacy amongst incarcerated folks? I mean like getting in the prison and teaching writing, poetry, speech, reading classes, or even just leading a book club..  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am 22, Afghanistan vet, and active VFW member. I love the VFW. They are one of the oldest VSOs around, and do tons for vets. Many young guys have an image of the VFW/Legion as a smoky, shitty bar full of drunk old farts. While some VFWs are like this, blanketing the whole organization as such is totally off base. Let me make some points.


1. Joining a VSO is about what you can give to the organization not what you get out of it. Many vets our age (and millenials in general) act pretty entitled. There has been an influx of new veterans organizations all about giving shit to vets, meanwhile these old vets and old VSOs are operating on a totally different premise. If you aren't looking for free shit or a pat on the back, but are looking to give back and continue your life of service, the VFW is a great place to be. The VFW offers many ways to get involved, showing up en masse to lonely vets funerals who die in nursing homes, getting involved with local organizations like habitat for humanity, getting involved with local politics to fight for vets, scholarship funds for vets kids, and even a home for orphans of war. 


2. Many guys discount these old VSOs because of the large number of Korea/Vietnam/old crusty vets. Doing so overlooks a huge resource. These guys have been there, done that, and seen most of the issues we are now facing. They make phenomenal (and willing) mentors. Sometimes the reason VFW bars are full of crusty old vets is because they have nowhere else to go where folks understand them. 

3. I have been very enriched by my experience with the VFW. The old guys in my post have given me solid (and sometimes blunt) advice, I have been able to continue civic service by volunteering with habitat for humanity and attending old vets funerals when they have nobody else. If your local post isn't perfect, none of us are so give them a break, join and make a difference.

There is a middle ground. Women do not want a controlling jerk, but they don't want a pushover pussy either. Make decisions. If you are going to take her out somewhere, think ahead and choose something, make a tentative plan. Don't just make decisions to make decisions, but use what you know she likes, and other info to make an informed decision. At the same time, you need to listen to her opinions, take them to heart, and add those to your internal database for future decisions. She does not want to be shut out of the decision making process, she just wants you to take initiative and action. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Jefferson thought that the American Revolution was a spark that would ignite liberty around the world. He advocated a worldwide awakening to "the spirit of `76". This belief coupled with his natural francophilia explain his ardent (sometimes radical) support for the French Revolution even after it turned chaotic. Other founders were not so enthusiastic. France went a different direction than the US, excluding moderate voices like Lafayette in favor of truly radical revolutionaries. 

All in all, I think the colonies proved that liberty could win, and that big empires could be defeated and in so doing acted as a touchstone for the French (who consequently used much of Jefferson's advice in their early Assembly of Notables) but ultimately each event had their own causes and sparking moments. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Every unit I have been in had fine, positive medics, who visited us when we were knee deep in shit. They rucked with us, convoyed with us,dug fighting positions with us,and talked like us. Many of them also inentionally reached out to soldiers in a positive way.


I always felt most Chaplains were pretty removed from the line..

You will be treated like a bitch. NCOs won't aaknowledge you as an NCO untl they have a bitch ass detail that requires an NCO. SPC will tell you to fuck off if you try to pull rank on them. Cpl's get all the responsibility, none of the pay, and very little of the authority of a sgt. 


Sometimes being a cpl makes your PSG want to send you to the board. More often, they realize they dont need to hurry and send you to the board. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am from a trailer park in South Alabama. I love the close knit community of my trailer park. I love how nobody puts on airs, everyone is truly free to be themselves. Attractive folks (trailer park girls are **sexy**) to unattractive folks, everyone gets along just fine. We have mechanics, retirees, a hooker, and a charter fishermen (among other trades). We are diverse ethnically, we listen to different types of music, we have different religions but we all get along. In my trailer park everyone is poor, but not ashamed of our poverty. So we don't make much, we get by through brow sweat and elbow grease.
