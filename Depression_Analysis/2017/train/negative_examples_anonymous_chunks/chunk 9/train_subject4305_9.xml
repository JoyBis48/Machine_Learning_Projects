	<TEXT> Debit is charged immediately, you can't refund it or adjust the charge once the transaction is completed. When it's done as credit the transaction is stored in the machine, it can be edited and deleted and doesn't go through to the bank until the terminal is closed out at the end of the day and even then the charge still usually takes a few days to go through. If you want to keep close track of your account the use debit.  </TEXT>

I havnt had a attack in almost two years and I eat shit loads of protein and drink fairly regularly. I do take allopurinol and naproxen so that does help. But the amount of protine I eat is absurd.     </TEXT>
