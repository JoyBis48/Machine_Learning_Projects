	<TEXT> I've never heard it said that way. One alcoholic death, however, can have a profound effect on many others. Truly "dying of alcoholism" - not including accidents - is gruesome. Unfortunately, I think that a common number bantered around right now is that 1 out of every 24 alcoholics ever makes it to the rooms. Of those, I'd guess that 1 in 10 is serious enough to survive. Most of the people I see in the rooms are only there to get their court papers signed to stay out of jail. </TEXT>
