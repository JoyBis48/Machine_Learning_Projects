In short, it is going back and forth between introverted intuition (Ni) and introverted feeling (Fi) without any extroverted thinking (Te).  The solution is thinking out loud with friends. 

Pretty much all the existentialists were/are INTJs.

	<TEXT> After the game, Kerr himself compared Curry to Jordan and Duncan, saying that he's seen those guys have games like that too.  To claim that the media just holds Lebron to a higher standard is a joke.  

Generally, the media can't be expected to report fairly on any of this.  They are fans and biased and irrational like the rest of us.  Though, as such, they shouldn't pretend to be otherwise - like they do.  

We're probably holding the media to too high a standard. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The ONLY non-canonic book you need is "Tao: The Watercourse Way", by Alan Watts. It is probably the simplest, clearest, most thorough book on the subject. Watts is an excellent communicator. But get The "Tao Te Ching" and "The Book of Chuang Tzu" also, of course. I think the Penguin versions/translations are best. 

For Zen, I would get Watts' "The Way of Zen", which has a very good chpater on Taoism.  And/or this book by DT Suzuki: http://www.amazon.com/Zen-Buddhism-Selected-Writings-Suzuki/dp/038548349X
