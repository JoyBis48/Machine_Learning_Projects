	<TEXT> Dear sir or madam, in reality increasing a minimum wage [creates more jobs](http://www.raisetheminimumwage.com/pages/job-loss). The lowest earners spend their money unlike the wealthy. When they spend their money this creates more economic growth and more jobs. The economic data is out there and it concludes increases in minimum wages increase the number of jobs in the free market. If we can supplement that with additional government created employment, it would create even more jobs and give us a strong economy.  </TEXT>
