	<TEXT> The three stars represent the past, which we must ever be mindful of; the present, whose importance needs no mentioning; and the future with all the promise it holds.

The 13 stripes represent the 13 states usually associated with the South.

The triangular motif is to represent the dynamics of time and the mending of past rifts, symbolizing the desire most Southerners have to mend the wounds of the past and move forward as part of a country we love. This point is exemplified in the joining of the two red stripes bordering the blue triangle. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, I had never stated that the factory committees needed to go away, as consensus is more often than not the best decision maker. Unfortunately, consensus can be difficult to build in conflict or crisis situations. I suppose that functional titles are fine in placid or sedentary organizations where change is slow in coming, but rapid and dynamic fields demand hierarchy. Hospitals and armies, for example, need ranks and authority. Factories, supermarkets (which should ideally be replaced by growers and farmers markets), and many technical fields can function quite well under the initial Soviet model. 

But yeah, fuck Stalin and his revisionist, reactionary ways. We agree there, I think. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Unfortunately, this was tried by the Voyenrevcom after the Russian revolution. Ranks, much like every other form of organizational hierarchy, were seen as bourgeois and oppressive and were thus done away with, replaced by functional titles. This worked quite poorly for the Red Army and served as an abject lesson. Unfortunately, hierarchy of some sort or another will always be needed, be it in offices or factories or the battlefield. The challenge is to ensure that everybody is compensated fairly and has equal opportunity to advance within this structure. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is what I came to say. Realize that to make something nuke proof will require a degree of flexibility in order for the structure to better absorb seismic shockwaves from ground detonations (which are actually quite rare in nuclear doctrine, as most nuclear exchange scenarios call for extensive use of airburst detonations, maximizing damage over a larger area. The extensive radiological contamination and presence of obscene amounts of, erm, fallout leads me to believe that the Chinese of the Fallout universe favored ground detonations.).

Anyway, in order to counter the almost earthquake like forces at play in ground detonations, many real world underground shelters, like nuclear silo control rooms, were built with hinges and joists pretty much everywhere. Realize that by the outset of Fallout 3, Vault 101 was over 200 years old. These joists and joints and hinges would have corroded and decayed. Honestly, I'd have expected the whole place to fall apart much sooner. We can engineer structures to survive a nuclear war, but humanity will never outlast the sands of time. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> To say that what capitalism is is inherent on the states it's produced is as flawed as Calling soviet Russia an authentic communist state

Hm. Those are terms that I'd understand. Got a source on that book? Is it in wiki commons or anything? I lean Marxist, if only because I'm fairly convinced that mankind can never possibly build Communism, but am always open to exposing myself to other points of view.

I do suppose, however, that my biggest problem with capitalism lies in its inherent ability to exploit and corrupt - much the same problem present in most strains of Socialist theory, mind you. Any time the exceptional are allowed to rise, they will generally abuse said power and exploit the proletariat. Advancement, it has been proven, rewards low level sociopathic traits to a degree. Further, the disabled and the elderly seem to have very little place in capitalist societies unless they demonstrate incredible intellect. Being a merely average cripple myself, that's a bone of contention for me.

Socialism, while *horrendously* flawed, seems much less ethically distasteful than capitalism in every form that I've encountered it.

I just realized that this has turned into a debate, so I apologize profusely if you weren't looking to get into one tonight. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, capitalism can be viewed as an outgrowth of feudalism. It's vast power in the hands of private individuals. It's hereditary wealth sustaining the upper classes. It's the few and the powerful owning and controlling the means of production. They're really quite similar, fundamentally speaking. In many parts of the world, the practical differences between capitalism and feudalism are more or less down to semantics. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, "paid." It's rather like what happens in a lot of sweatshops or in Scientology's Sea Org. You're paid, but when it's not in [scrip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrip) you're docked for things like food, healthcare, tools, training, and mandatory housing. What they charge you for these things often ends up costing more than you make. Happily, they have a solution for you. Just work off the balance of what you owe. But you never work it off. You'd leave, but some grubby sheik has your passport and the factory is locked. They've bought the cops and you don't know the language. So you're stuck.

Isn't capitalism just wonderful? </TEXT>

Seeing as how so much good came of that leak and the public now knows much more about the horrible things our government is doing, I'd say that it's a justifiable treason.

Besides, you'll often find that your Chelsea Mannings and Edward Snowdens are motivated by deep seated patriotism. We could use more traitors like them. If you want some traitors to be angry at, look at the ALEC and Wall Street thugs who stole our country from the working man.  </TEXT>

The Confederate Battle Flag isn't so terrible. It was simply the banner of a group of men who fought back against what they saw as an invasion from the North and is therefore a perfectly valid symbol of rebelliousness and Southern heritage. It's the first national flag of the Confederacy that was forged by a bunch of slave owners for a government designed to keep black people in bondage. That one seems to get a pass, though. It's even in the state flag today as a 'compromise' from when people got offended about the '56 flag. It seems like a step backwards to me, but whatever. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My interpretation of the situation back in California is that the East Coast Brotherhood is on a much better material footing than the home chapter, but hasn't got as much in the way of leadership and strategic expertise. The DC Brotherhood simply lacks the scribes, Elders, and veterans that California has. So I think that it's tough to say that either one is really stronger, they just have different strengths.

That said, given the West Coast's political situation, I feel a lot less hopeful about the California Brotherhood's long term prospects than I do the DC Brotherhood's. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I love the South and much like Cascadia and New England, I believe it deserves a regional flag of its own. However, the old symbols of the Confederacy are much too divisive to represent a region and its aspirations for the future. Therefore, I felt compelled to use what little graphic design skill I have to put forward a replacement.

The 13 stripes represent the 13 states usually associated with the South.

The three stars represent the past, which we must ever be mindful of; the present, whose importance needs no mentioning; and the future with all the promise it holds.

The triangular motif is to represent the dynamics of time and the mending of past rifts, symbolizing the desire most Southerners have to mend the wounds of the past and move forward as part of a country we love. This point is exemplified in the joining of the two red stripes bordering the blue triangle.

What do you think? Comments and suggestions are much appreciated. I just wanted to have a flag that all Southerners - white, black, asian, and latin could fly proudly as a banner of their home region. 

EDIT: Might as well ask so I can tell what I'm doing wrong, but why's this topic suddenly getting downvoted? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The flag I was referring to is actually more broadly African than I thought, but it's Marcus Garvey's [Pan-African flag.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan-African_flag)

I, too, had ancestors on both sides of the conflict and rather like a German who had ancestors in World War II, I'm proud of what my forebearers achieved, though not who they achieved it for. The Battle Flag might not be the most progressive emblem out there, but to me it characterizes my home, my ancestors, and my heritage. If there's a Confederate flag that's offensive, it's the first National Flag, but that seems to be viewed as the more benign flag for some reason. 

But this is dangerously close to devolving into a rant. I'm quite well read on the war and even moreso on its aftermath and lingering effects on the South and its development. I gather that you are, as well.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Other than apocryphal stories I can tell you from my father and grandfather who often saw it displayed proudly by whites, blacks, and others throughout the South before the mid-eighties, I can point to its use in the armed forces [as seen here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flags_of_the_Confederate_States_of_America#20th-century_popularity) and to its history as a symbol of rebellious elements of the New South from pop culture, such as the Dukes of Hazzard. Beyond that, though, I'm just a guy who likes the South and would rather not have the only distinctively Southern flag seen as a symbol of bigotry. I mean, if the Confederate Battle Flag is a symbol of evil then the US Flag certainly is, yet you can fly it without anybody batting an eye. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I can't seem to recall if the sign said that was the gas price specifically, as my resolution was shitty for that stream, but it doesn't have to be gas. Remember, many cars were running on nuclear fuel by then. My hypothesis (just off the top of my head) is that it was the price per gallon for reactor coolant, or possibly water. If the sign actually said "gasoline" it could even be a repurposed old gas sign considering the relative newness of nuclear cars.
Did the station have actual gas pumps? I can't remember.


Of course, the dollar may have been drastically revalued by then, though this is slightly unlikely given that a Cryslus Corvega costs "only" $199,999.99. Unless it's a super luxury car, a dollar may be worth about a quarter of what it is in the real world right now. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is a rather difficult place to be in. We can't just pick and choose when we want to use profiling. We have to either admit that it has a place in sentencing and policing or do the egalitarian thing and discard it on the grounds of individuality skewing such models beyond usefulness. Tough spot to be in, I'd say. </TEXT>
