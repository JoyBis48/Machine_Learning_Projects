	<TEXT> Everything Everything can best be described as Prog Pop but critics will label them as Art Rock. The band says they skew more pop. Whatever it is, its a smorgasbord of everything you know you didnt want to hear in music. The Lyrics are provocative and the music straddles the border of the most progressive to the catchiest of pop hooks. A must listen! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I work in music distribution on the retail side of things. I've been lucky enough to work both at major labels and indie labels. People are buying records more than you think so thank you to everyone who supports artists and by association, the people like us who work for them. It is part of my job to get familiar with every DMS (digital music service) as to better cater our content to their consumers. 

I am a Spotify power user. I love Spotify. It is my choice for on demand streaming. There are tons of great alternatives that essentially provide the same benefits like Deezer, now soft launching in the US, Rdio, Google Play All Access, Tidal, Guvera and many more. 

While I use Spotify for the endless amounts of curated mixes for any mood, genre, decade, (not to mention pick   curate my own playlists) I use Google Play Access to store all of my owned and downloaded content in the cloud. This way I can listen to anything I own that may not be available for streaming. Google also has an a la carte download model akin to iTunes. 

A new service called MixRadio (formally Nokia Music) is what I use for personalized algorithmic based playlists. Users get 6 skips and it is ad supported but the amount of music I have learned from using this service has amazed me ever since its launch. It learns your likes and dislikes better than most all other services IMO. Definitely give it a try.

Other stores like eMusic are totally different. They have a tiered subscription model for members. Each tier allows customers to buy a certain dollar amount of music a month. $11.99 a month gives you roughly 25 song downloads at $.69 - $.99 a track or 3-4 full albums. The plans range from amount to amount but prices are very competitive to combat iTunes leading download store market share. 

End of the day, it is what works for you. As long as you consume music in a way that is convenient all while supporting the artists and business people behind the scenes, its all good. Happy listening!

	<TEXT> By Bran's burden I mean his journey.  He is beyond the wall with the Reeds to learn what the three eyed raven is about, the significance of his visions and who 'the children' and how they can help. Not to mention honing his warg ability. Probably a host of other things but those are probably some of the most important bits.  </TEXT>
