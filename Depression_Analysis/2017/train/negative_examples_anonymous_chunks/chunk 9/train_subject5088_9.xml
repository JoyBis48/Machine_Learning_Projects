	<TEXT> His character/writing has definitely gotten more humorous this season. After all, he has gotten some of the best one liners on the show. 

"Spitters are quitters, and you don't look like a quitter to me."

They were so civil with each other that it almost blindsided me when Will pulled that knife out to stab Hannibal later. Though I guess it makes sense,  </TEXT>

I really expected her to get offed by Hannibal, but it looks like she's gonna pull through alright. I guess she's survived this long because she can go toe to toe with Hannibal any day. Remember that quip about his sister?

	<TEXT> I thought he was too far gone to gain redemption, but was looking forward to watch him at least try. 

EDIT: Apparently according to a screen cap from one of the season trailers, he's still alive. Also, in the next episode promo, the detective only refers to Ray as "one of his detective getting shot"... so I'm guessing he's still alive. Way too much unresolved story arc and wasted character development there otherwise. </TEXT>
