	<TEXT> I'm not really interested in getting help because I would feel bad. I don't consider it a handicap or anything. I do recognize the issues but I feel like I live a relatively normal life compared to people that are worse off than me. On that note, if I could get scholarships because of it that would be so great. </TEXT>
