	<TEXT> Disagree. You can always move to somewhere remote (Siberia, Northern Canada, etc) where, yes, you'll be technically under state rule, but you'd be so far removed from society that no one will care. 

I've long thought of setting up a commune in the Western US to do just that. Something akin to Slab City.  </TEXT>

Manager: Then why are you looking for a job with solar? 

Me: I'm looking to get new skills and learn new things, and I know solar is an up and coming industry. Plus my family back home is getting solar panels so that gave me the idea to apply. 

That was it, and the hiring manger was impressed.  :) </TEXT>

I do have an offer from another company at 15/hr + commission. If the company I interviewed with today calls me back with an offer, can I counter with the 15 (assuming what they offer is less when I do the math)? Or am I screwed?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've done VISTA, and now I'm with S/N.

Let me say I much prefer S/N, as I'm allowed to do direct service. Within my first week as an S/N, I was meeting clients, handling their cases, and feeling good about my job. VISTA (which dos not allow direct service) didn't give me that feeling. I'd have clients come into my organisation's office asking for help, and I couldn't give it. Felt bad.

That said, I feel like VISTA can give you better job experience after your term ends, as what you're doing will typically be more professional.  </TEXT>

Modern Quakers practice sex, although due to a lack of proselyting, Quakerism *is* dying off. Most Friends are older, so the faith will probably die out by the end of the century. </TEXT>

Now various life choices have placed my in Provo, so I've started attending services again. It's a hard transition, and I'm working on getting my testimony built back up. If I fail to believe again, I'll still attend services so I can learn and make friends. What's been nice is my bishop and a few others know I'm not LDS, yet they've all been very accepting.  </TEXT>

Let me say that I had extreme anxiety for a few days after my VISTA term came to a close early. I was only able to really make it by moving in with an aunt in Salt Lake. So I recommend trying to find some contacts before you quit and move, people who would be willing to help you out in a pinch.

If you don't know anyone (and it doesn't seem like you would), find a job first. Being unemployed sucks. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> VERY. I'm in Provo, Utah right down the street from BYU. Mormons get married *very* young compared to other faiths (which is why Utah is the youngest state-there's a high birth rate). I'm within the Mormon dating scene, and right now everything isn't that bad, but I imagine it gets harder during the school year. A lot of women leave for their missions too, which saturates the market (female enrollment at BYU dropped when women were allowed to serve at a younger age, starting a few years ago).

	<TEXT> Like which ones? I can think of the Unitarians and Quakers, but neither have creeds about believing in the Bible, nor do they have any sort of religious doctrine. 

(I'm only asking because I just don't know what sects you're talking about, and I consider myself a Christian, so I'm just curious because I like exploring different denominations) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was in Japan with a student travel group for two weeks. One of our stops was Kyoto, which is a really pretty city. Being an adventurous 15 year old, I decided to leave our group hotel in the middle of the night to explore the city a bit. Eventually, I got lost and started panicking. 

Then, I saw a police officer. Thank goodness! So I approach him.

"Sumi-ma-sen, do you know where ABC hotel is?"

The police man shakes his head and says, "No English."

I say "arigato" and turn around disappointed. But then I remember my hotel had a specific coffee shop inside of it, so I turn around again.

"Sumi-ma-sen...Starbucks-u?"

The police man smiles and points me the way. I was very thankful for capitalism that day.  </TEXT>
