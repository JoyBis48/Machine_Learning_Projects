I was working security this year (I was the guy with the fauxhawk you may have seen looking dangerously determined at times) 

Thank you guys for keeping the spaghetti contained. Especially with the documentary crew there too. You were awesome fun to watch do your crazy thing, and I wouldn't miss attending it or working it for the world.

Now, I'm sleeping. Good night!

(P.S. If you're at the FAB Party, have a cider for me, will you?) </TEXT>

Luckily, I go to a lot of metal gigs so I just run in moshpits and get a lot of my stress out that way, but summer's always quiet.

Up until last year, I was pretty set on everything I was.. Then It's just been turned around a little bit, then the last few days have happened and I'm not entirely sure of myself anymore - at all. 

It's been a bit of a crazy month, compared to my usual day-in-day-out monotony of the last 6 years, everything crazy just happened in the space of a week. </TEXT>

Ace is just the nickname for Asexual. We're not sexually attracted to anyone, but we can be romantically attracted.

Short term - go a bit mental. Go to all the festivals, travel the world, see things, do things.

Long term - Be very Philanthropic. Startups looking for funding? Here you go - no biggie if it doesn't go anywhere. Invest in stuff. Start up my own silly little gaming cafe thing, just because I can. Giveaways every day. 

Dunno, in short. Just attach a a little tap to my bank account which will inevitably spring a leak and I won't give a crap to fix it. </TEXT>

Look for decent coverage in the area you play a lot in.

I run with a Nexus 4 myself, on the Giffgaff network in the UK and it does pretty well. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, twitching out on my end too. My scanner was showing a portal I'd captured a day or two earlier only having 1 level 1 resonator on it. Even though I'd upgraded to 4 4's and 4 3's.

Friend's scanner was showing that. Force stopped the app, restarted and everything - still nothing. Hope all is fixed by tomorrow. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As some of the posters have already said - there's no need to label yourself or just jump right into the deep end. 

I made my first 'sona almost a decade ago now, but it's only within the last few months I've decided "I'm a furry"

I don't let the label dictate me, nor the fandom. I'm also a brony, writer, doodler, and Asexual.

All of those have all sorts of different stereotypes, yes, they make me what I am today, but don't let one label get you down if you feel you _have_ to use that label. </TEXT>
