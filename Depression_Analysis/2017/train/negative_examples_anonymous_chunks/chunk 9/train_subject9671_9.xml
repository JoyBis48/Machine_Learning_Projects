	<TEXT> Three times- the first time I met my newborn baby brother, and he grabbed my little finger with his tiny fist, and when I went for a random snorkel off of the boat tour I was on- a shark loomed straight out of the gloom, circled me a few times, then disappeared. Was amazing. The last time was at my Aunt's farm in outback Australia- a confluence of five storms met over the valley she lives in, and we were surrounded by lightning strikes all around- spectacular and terrifying all at once. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Smartphones, genuinely.

People would be more aware of everything around them, information would be harder to come by and therefore more rewarding to discover, and finally, I'd have never been cheated on if the ease of a smartphone's apps and Internet access hasn't made it possible for online relationships to blossom between strangers. </TEXT>

Seriously; you don't like me, therefore you're a man hater.

No my (and I use the term loosely) friend, I believe the derivative we can get from this exchange of messages is that you're an unhealthily sexist egotist. And that's just the bare minimum description! </TEXT>

If there's a reason she dislikes the mixed-bred races that fuels her passion, even if she's not a great rhetoric, a mob can easily form behind someone who is zealous enough in a singular belief.

	<TITLE> Oils and Brushes queries </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-05-09 05:16:43 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hey guys, I'm 25 and only just started to grow my beard and moustache out for the first time (properly).

The longest I've had it is a months growth, today sees it reach two months. My girlfriend trims it every two weeks for me, snipping the straggly hairs and split ends to keep it even, so I'm covered there, and I condition it every time I shower (5/6 times a week).

First question; I've read about JoJoba, Argan and Almond oils- do these have to be specifically labelled as for beard use, or can you buy some "normal" almond oil (for example, say from the cooking oils or health foods sections) and apply a few drops of that?

Second question- what type of brush would be a good substitute for the high-end brushes I've read about? We're backpacking so money's quite tight.

We live in Australia at the moment, for shop references we have Target, Woolworths, IGA and Big W in our town.

Will try and update/edit this soon with a picture, maybe even a before/after double. Thanks in advance for any advice and help! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I like the insecure rogue/thief/assassin- he/she's really doubtful of themselves, unsure of their place in the city/country/world, and absolutely certain there are people out there better than them.

They put on the "best ever ego" march to cover this up.

The humanity is what gets me, or at least emotion. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I find Pinterest SUCH an awesome help for pretty much everything. Combine fantasy with creature, race, myth, monster, anything you like really, and you'll get great results.

My own loves?

- Condors (also giant birds but a different species)
- Manticores
- Chimera (I love the variability of this one; pick your animals to mix together!)


I also like to think more of on the ground/underground, as a LOT of people give flying to the biggest bad-monster/creature. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Okay, so I've begun to finally get on top of my aches and pains. Thanks for the advice previously all who gave it.

Now, you've worked all week, getting dirty, achey and tired- what's your best remedy for recharging and resetting your body for another working week in your day/days off? What combination of food/meals/activities/rest cycles/doing nothing helps you come back into the next new week kicking? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks for all the replies:

I worked in a warehouse lifting weights of up to 25KG for 8 hours 5/6 days every week for two and a half years, so I'm not unused physical labour.

I shower as soon as I get home, and socks and boxers are always clean on, as are my tops. My nails are always trimmed (I'm anal about them), but the dirt seems to get to a place my nail scrubber doesn't reach.

I will try and get my hands on some foot powder and coconut oil, and a ball or roller if I can find one. Thanks for the encouragement, where given- I'm determined to keep on keeping on! </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Okay so I've been working on an Avocado farm for three weeks now. I shower daily after work and shower/condition my beard and hair as well.

My fingernails stay dirty, the skin around them is cracked, peeling, dead and dying, my fingers feel stiff and swollen (even though they're not), my joints ache and crack with most normal movements (knees and back/neck mainly), and the skin on the soles of my feet/toes is three times as worse as my fingers.

Does anyone have any hints/tips to help keep these areas healthy/in good condition during this period of rough working? I'm planning on staying at this farm for the full six months (I'm in Oz on a working holiday visa), so want to be able to keep working!

P.s. I need my hands glove-free for the work I do, so unfortunately that won't help (also, the initial skin death/peeling around my fingers started when I used gloves for weeding for a week).

Any help would be greatly appreciated. </TEXT>
