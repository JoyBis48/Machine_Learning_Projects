	<TEXT> If you think a job that requires 18 months continuous training and assessment is semi-skilled then I don't know what to tell you. A bachelor's degree is only 12 months full time over three years. 

Basic is around 42k most drivers are required to work rest days and many find themselves working 6 or 7 day weeks - the best paid drivers earn as much as 60k but work insane overtime to achieve that kind of take home.

	<TEXT> This is three unions rather than just the RMT, and two of those unions haven't attempted strike action in a decade.

While I don't think the RMT behave reasonably and frequently seem tone deaf in approaching strike action, having worked inside the underground system designing software for them, the tube unions have a *very* real point about pay and conditions. NHS staff, particularly the nurses, could learn a great deal from their approach to collective bargaining.

The figures bandied around for what tube drivers earn are mostly nonsense and far from the average wage. Conditions have reached a point where drivers are having to limit their fluid intake because they can't easily use the toilet. Some of what goes on down there beggars belief.

It's also worth pointing out that the RMT's successful bargaining means they're the only group of labourers in the country whose wages have kept pace with inflation decadally - it's not that the drivers are overpaid, it's that everyone else is underpaid. </TEXT>

While I agree with you on austerity all the arguments made against the euro were made against the dollar when it became a 'new' thing, and despite endless predictions of doom the Euro has thrived for the most part. If you live in central Europe, as I have, it makes a great deal more sense than the old system. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Actually I've been watching F1 for nearly 40 years, and you apparently don't know a great deal about how teams, aero and engine manufacturers work together or what the possibilities are from that cooperation. None of those diffusers would have worked without Renault's design efforts - not one.

Mercedes did a fantastic job getting their engine into a chassis designed for Honda's PU, but Brawn said at the time that they picked Mercedes as a supplier because it was the engine that 'best fitted' the chassis they had.

Sure Renault find themselves in a bad situation, no worse than any in the history of the sport, but still very bad. But it's not 100% their fault. They don't appear to have a partner they can work together with to solve the *team's* problems. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh god, the usual quote-back/you're stupid nonsense from the Kiptard contingent. *sigh*. Called stupid in less than three comments FFS - I wish I was surprised.

- We're not talking about the Tories and criticism of one party's policy isn't an automatic comparison with or acceptance of any other party's policy.

- UKIP say they want to *increase* defense spending to 2% of GDP, but our existing spending is 2.1% of GDP down from 2.4% in 2010. They also want to go back to 2010 troop levels and capability whilst replacing trident and spending around 400 million on a dedicated military hospital. Usual inconsistency from UKIP but this all adds up to a *huge* increase in defense oriented spending.

- Yes they do favor harsh restrictions on immigrants and their policy actually is a disincentive to the free-trade policy they advocate elsewhere. Read the manifesto and think through the effect of their policy. If, for example, a senior member of a US company wanted to move here they would be dragged through a points based system (this takes 12 - 18 months right now and costs 3 - 5k) and so would their family members wishing to join them - each family member would have to pass the same system as the policy is presently written.

- They want to leave the the world's largest free trade bloc (the EU) in order to make free-trade agreements with every other country independently. However there are only 25 countries globally not in trading blocs and our interfaces with those trading blocs are all through the EU. They advocate no other forms of international cooperation other than trade and specifically wish to favor the 'Anglosphere' when trading.

In short Kiptard's specialise in ignorant one dimensional thinking and wish you guys would read the big book political theories before vomiting your crap online. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think they'd like to claim they're libertarians and there are certainly elements of libertarian policy in their dicta, but they're as fundamentally Statist of a group as I can think of having read the manifesto - they're certainly not a party of small government given the sheer volume of rules they wish to impose.

They want huge increase in defence spending, their base favors harsh policing and criminal justice policies, harsh restrictions on immigrants and they anti-international co-operation on anything but trade and even then they'd like it all their own way - all authoritarian values.

	<TEXT> When you look at enacted policy across the political spectrum in this country you realise that all governments are centre right, and there is an obvious decadal rightward drift among all parties - inertia meaning that the further right UKIP drift, the further right *all* parties drift. 

By enacted policy there isn't a credible centrist party in the UK, nor is there a credible left wing party, although there are parties that have left wing members and some elements of traditional left wing ideas - all parties are centre right. How individuals view their party alignments appears to me to be a function of where they think the centre is more than any other factor.

That drift is most obvious in the US right now (although UKIP's effect on all party's policy demonstrates the same effect). Obama is basically a Reagan era moderate Republican with liberal personal social values, and the Republicans have gone so far to the right that they sound like a fringe party on almost any subject. Trump's candidacy being the zenith of that drift.

Churchill for example had this to say on the NHS:-

The discoveries of healing science must be the inheritance of all. That is clear: Disease must be attacked,  whether it occurs in the poorest or the richest man or woman simply on the ground that it is the enemy; and it must be attacked just in the same way as the fire brigade will give its  full assistance to the humblest cottage as readily as to the  most important mansion.Our policy is to create a national health service in order to ensure that everybody in the country, irrespective of means, age, sex, or occupation, shall have equal opportunities to benefit from the best and most up-to-date medical and allied services available.

No modern Conservative would recognise the post war Conservative party's policy positions as being truly Conservative outside of their views on personal social policy i.e. homosexuality and marrige. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Friedman assumed that 'people' would all, or at least mostly, be shareholders in the corporations and there would therefore be social pressure on these organisations to act toward the benefit of the communities they were part of as well as financial benefit for everyone.

That hasn't happened. Major corporations are owned, in the main, by other corporations, institutions, and private investment companies - and therefore act only in the interests of increasing financial reward at all costs. Meaning, sadly, those corporations have no social value at all.

If there is a single problem in the capitalist system we now live in it's shareholder value versus social value - there is too much of the former and not enough of the latter. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's not true at all. Renault deserve enormous credit for innovations like RBR's many diffusers - which rely on Renault engineers and installers to make them work on the car.

F1 is a team sport, the chassis does not work without the engine and you can't bugger about with the movement of exhaust gases at the back of the car in any way without tremendous work from your engine and fuel suppliers.

This isn't the middle school playground and the amount of crass, uninformed bitching going on these days is ruining many of the discussions on this sub.

The early part of every engine era is marked by these kind of problems - this is how we advance our understanding of technologies and create innovative leaps.

	<TEXT> During the last European election campaign Blair did a spot on Radio 4. He summed up in two sentences why Europe was important and why we should stay in it - something no other politician achieved.

Anyone listening realised immediately that there wasn't a politician in any party even half as good as Blair was and is.

We will only win if we find someone with his clarity and communication skills - I don't see anyone in the leadership election with a tenth of his potential at the same stage. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They do, that's true, but having re-designed the billing system for one of the major suppliers in the last few years I have little sympathy for them - electronic systems in the industry are a disaster as is the underlying infrastructure and that's simply down to underinvestment and lack of will on the part of the government and the industry. 

IMO what they're really doing is using the charge to cover debt losses for the poorest consumers. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When it comes to cars the actual cost of the part matters very little.

Knowing, for example, that I can obtain a 3rd party part for n amount doesn't mean that I know, or can find out, the cost of the manufacturer part and it doesn't tell me the price range vs quality of third party parts. 

It also doesn't allow me determine the amount of labour required. The part on the car may be seized or corroded - it may take time to get *to* the part that needs to be replaced.

The cost of a head gasket won't tell you how long it takes to rebuild the engine. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think in the background of all of this they were attempting a political takeover of the sport through breaking up FOTA and looking towards a commercial rights buyout - but they lost the battle over the regs and were outmaneuvered by Mercedes politically as well as outperformed on the track. 

CVC was an odd partner choice at the time but my guess is this was Bernie outmaneuvering a RBR aligned buyer. Its interesting that a company led by the man who sued Bernie for bribery is now in the frame to buy the commercial rights, along with a Quatari company with links to RBR.

This is why RBR have chucked their toys out of the pram, they lost the battles and lost the war. Now they're stuck with Renault because they don't want a 'B' Ferrari engine, can't have a Mercedes one, can't get an 'A' spec Honda engine (Ron Dennis isn't stupid), and don't have any other options.

But they have overplayed their hand again and pissed Renault off. Now they have no remaining options. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The debate always takes place at the extremes of what you can get in certain circumstances and adds universal benefits like child benefit to the total to make an argument, but very few people get that kind of money. 

I have friends who have to find an additional 55 a week on top of their housing benefit to pay the rent, but only get 53 a week spending money. In effect the government is running people into arrears to reduce the deficit and using a moral approach to the argument rather than a pragmatic one. The basic theory is that people on benefits don't want to work - but that isn't true in the majority of cases, even if it is true for some. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The reason they're in F1 is marketing - they've said this - the deal with RBR is not getting them helpful exposure and the way RBR has behaved has not helped Renault one iota.

Essentially they're saying the money is irrelevant compared to the marketing value of the sport, they want to be involved in the sport, but need to have greater exposure and be in control of their own press.

Mercedes successful involvement along with the recovery from global recession has changed the maths for manufacturers, as has the sport making entries into new countries the world over and taking the US seriously at last. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> New car to us, but actually 10 year old Passat Highline. The front of the headlight casings had fogged completely, but no new bulbs were needed as the ones in it were brand new high intensity bulbs, the alignment was also badly off. 

Its a complicated job to replace them as you have to take the front end off the car to get to the lamp housings otherwise I'd have done it myself (I did try, but conditions in my driveway are too cramped). The rest of the work was new suspension arm rubber bushes all round, osf suspension arm ball joint dust cover, nsf/osf tie rod rubber bush, pads, discs, and a brake caliper (all the brake calipers were seized) plus a new centre brake light.

I just couldn't get over the cost of two new headlamp units from the dealer.  </TEXT>

My partner and I both work full time and when our car needed work we both lost wages trying to find a reasonable price for a fix - and that was only going to two places - so we took the second quote. If the first hadn't been on its face unreasonable I would have taken that one for the simple reason that I was losing money by other means trying to sort the problem.

	<TEXT> Its hard to say without knowing the role specifics or skillset but a team lead / manager / senior engineer in desktop support is around 50k GBP at the top end of the market. General desktop support worker is around 25k.

50k is also where you'd come out in a straight currency conversion from $78k so I'd suggest that what you should seek.

Average income in the UK is around 24k, subsistence level income in London is around 20k so you should be comfortably off on 50k. 

To give you some idea of pricing. A Zone 1 - 3 weekly travelcard (covers bus, train, tram and tube) is 37.70, a pint of beer is 4.50 - 4.80 depending on the area, chinese takeaway is around 7 - 10 per head, a Starbucks Grande Latte is 2.60 as is a Big Mac. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You just live in a fantasy world. Go back to your school and demand the education they clearly failed to provide you.

I just re-read the thread. Normally I assume that people can understand things when they're explained properly, but the brain crushing ignorance of KipTards just staggers me. You'll literally say anything, vomit out any crap, to try and pretend you have a point no matter the weight of evidence to the contrary - the stuff you've written above about the free trade areas is just... crap. Total unmitigated crap. I'm actually surprised you can operate a computer.

	<TEXT> I laughed out loud reading this, rarely has a Kipper managed to spout so much nonsense in one comment.

- Manufacturers want to sell one product to one set of regulations in as many places as possible, so much so that they often design around the cross regulation issues. You'll notice that many new cars have daytime running lights which allow them to be sold in scandinavian markets, and left/right headlight switches so the same vehicle can be sold in the UK and France with only software changes. Regulation codes are the single biggest problem businesses have and business spends tens of millions each year lobbying for changes.

- ONR is an operational safety body, it does not design or spec nuclear reactors and you, sir, are obviously an idiot to claim what you have here. Hinkley Point C, the first of eight UK sites, is presently being constructed. It's two *European* Pressurised Reactors are being built to a French Design which has become an EU standard by two French companies. EDF, one of those companies, will own the land and the plant along with the output (we are of course subsiding the build). This makes sense since they bought British Energy lock stock and barrel in 2009 and basically now own our entire nuclear industry. If we leave the EU this will prove highly problematic because their business runs to EU standards and is regulated by the EU, not us. Same situation in rail, water, fossil energy, parts of the oil industry, and Alliance Boots (our largest Pharmacy network) is also wholly European owned.

- I've worked for SWIFT, you simply don't have the slightest idea what you're talking about there. I assumes from the crap you've vomited that you simply read wiki. Iran isn't even the only country barred from the network.

- ISO manage the standards that US and now UK plugs are built to, because NEMA and BS have harmonised their standards through ISO. The UK is a voting member of ISO so we do actually have a role in the electrical and manufacturing standards US plugs are built to.

I see that you have become confused after claiming:

The current situation with the EU is the exception, leaving the EU would just put us in the same position we are with every other country.


And could not understand it when you were so obviously wrong. 

In fact almost all countries in the world are involved in some kind of economic integration or free trade area - there is even a handy  [map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_multilateral_free_trade_agreements#Operating_agreements) showing how wrong you are. The list next to it shows many free trade areas, and our ability to trade in those areas is conducted through the EU. So leaving the EU wouldn't put the UK in the 'same position as every other country' as you claim, it would actually set us at odds with the overwhelming majority of other countries.

Many Tories and Kippers claimed during Indyref that Scotland couldn't possibly renegotiate all these agreements and would therefore be unable to trade across large parts of the world. The same applies to England.

Your UKIPCrapFu is obviously strong, having made personal attacks claim the other person started it and you show classic KipTard misdirection when wrong - shout louder, claim the opposition is stupid and hope nobody notices how wrong you are.

Seriously, there is a whole world out there if you would just educate yourself about how it operates.

	<TEXT> The net effect of UKIP's immigration and trade policy together will achieve exactly that - and that is by design. Few if any would make it through the system he is proposing and each family member that wanted to join them would have to go through the same points based process. Its profoundly ludicrous and a profound disincentive to business.

The answer to your second question is 'How can you have free trade for businesses without a free labour market for people?' You can't. If a business is free to trade with another in the UK how can it do so when every member of its staff has to be dragged through the same months long process in order to complete a simple deal. They'll just go find a partner in a country with less restrictive policies - there are many to choose from. How could a manufactuer set up a UK base and bring over experienced staff to train new staff under those circumstances!

UKIP *is* proposing that the UK should stand alone. Farage's fantasy is that outside the EU the size of the UK economy will be attractive enough that we will be able to make trade deals with everyone. He stated exactly this in a recent EU speech on the African migrant crisis - he wants an end to all free trade blocs in order to allow everyone to trade together. He doesn't seem to understand that this didn't work the first time around.

So why would America waste their time on a trade deal with one country when you could access the EU with only one deal, and use that as leverage to access NAFTA? It wouldn't happen - because it doesn't happen. Almost every country on earth is part of a [free trade bloc or union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_multilateral_free_trade_agreements#Operating_agreements) for a reason. You'll notice the ones that aren't are not exactly economic powerhouses. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes. But it all depends on where you think the centre is. 

The right wing justices voted with the Obama administration more this term than the left wing judges did, meaning the Obama administration won just 38% of its cases compared to an average between 60 - 70% per term for governments of all stripes. 

Scalia was in the majority in only 48 percent of this terms cases and Thomas in only 33 percent, which is historically low and very telling of the position of the court overall.

Also it wasn't just two issues on which the court leaned left - of course there was marriage equality, housing discrimination, Obamacare, and legislative districting but also a whole host of criminal justice issues that received much less attention (see link below).

It appears two forces are at work, the court has indeed leaned left this term, and the Obama administration has taken a much more authoritarian tack on criminal justice cases (but realistically everyone has a distorted view of the centre because both Republicans and Democrats are, by enacted policy, centre right parties).

[The two justices](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/jurisprudence/2015/06/supreme_court_liberal_on_criminal_justice_issues_clarence_thomas_sided_with.html) who cast the most votes against the administration this term were Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer, each opposing the administration in 71 percent of the cases. Justice Sonia Sotomayor isnt far behind, voting against the administration 67 percent of the time. Who voted the most with the administration? Justices Clarence Thomas and Anthony Kennedy, who each sided with the administration more often than not (in 52 percent of the cases). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you look at it from a short term perspective sure. The problem is that growing up in poverty limits both your prospects, your lifetime earnings, and increases the amount you need from the state, thereby limiting your contribution to the state. Its basically a generational problem and we are seeing record low levels of social mobility.

So insisting that another generation grow up with low educational attainment and spend their lives stuck in nothing jobs is simply spawning a new generation of benefit claimants.

Minimum incomes actually assist in resolving a long term problems and reduce future welfare bills. </TEXT>

A globalised streaming solution for F1, no matter how much I might desire one, isn't going to generate that kind of revenue, and that will directly affect the viability of the middle and lower grid teams.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Its inconsistent because you say you want free trade, but then say that all markets must be regulated. What Farage, and apparently you, are seeking is deregulated trade markets with heavy personal border restrictions - two policies completely at odds with each other. Even Australia doesn't do this.

So you're happy to have your products regulated by the EU, and have companies regulated by the EU (which includes our entire nuclear industry, water industry, rail, energy, our largest pharmacy networks - all of which would be regulated by the EU because they're all owned by European companies), but have no control over that regulation? Really? I suppose that kind of illogic is what I should expect from Kippers.

We do have a means of regulating how banks in China and banks worldwide operate, its called SWIFT, it's based in Brussels and it controls and operates the network which connects all banks globally. Banks have to meet and observe certain standards to use it, and the EU regulates the trade of foreign owned banks operating within the EU.

We also have a voting role in regulating standards for American plugs through the International Standards Organisation incidentally.

The current situation is far from the exception. We are members of the World Trade Organisation via the EU, our interface with NAFTA is through the EU, as is our interface with the Asian Free Trade Area, Indian Free Trade Area, The Common Market For East and Southern Africa and dozens of others - EVERYONE is in a free trade area of some kind, as this handy [map shows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_multilateral_free_trade_agreements#/media/File:Economic_integration_stages_(World).png)

So, as I said earlier, Kippers want to leave all of that and sulk behind their little wall while everyone else trades happily together. 

Frankly the mendacious crap spewed by the likes of Farage and yourself appals me - you're astonishingly ignorant of world trade and how the world actually operates but sit there and snipe like you know what you're talking about.

	<TEXT> My, how deeply you have sucked on the head of Faragian wisdom. Sorry but the world just doesn't work that way - it never has.

A minute ago you were advocating free trade (Farage's vision is no restrictions on trade at all), but now 'every market must be regulated' - how inconsistent. Its not a false premise because one market feeds the other.

Incase you hadn't noticed the vehicle standards you refer to are the EuroEncap Standards - based on DfT research in the 80s - and its the EU that does the regulating. We would simply stick to those standards because we don't have a standards body (it wouldn't matter if we did), but we wouldn't have any say in what they were. Just as British vehicles sold overseas already obey those countries standards without involvement in the regulation.

Its the same with trade - we would be free to trade with whomever we wanted, so long as we obeyed their standards, but we would have no role at all in determining those standards. Norway, oft cited by Farage, says that it simply does what the EU asks (their trade minister laughed at Farage's comments and that's why our Nige stopped talking about them).

So the world Kippers are seeking is one in which Britian sits behind a wall and obeys every command given to it.

	<TEXT> Our trading block is with the EU, they are the body through which we make trade agreements with the rest of the world. So, no, there isn't more to the world than the EU where trade is concerned.

But the most important questions underlying the debate are "How can you have free trade for business without a similarly free labour market for people?" and "How can you hope to compete economically with Russia, China, US   Canada, and the BRIC countries standing alone?"

Farage's answer is to close all borders to people, allow the businesses to do what they like, and hope our products are so good people will demand them and we don't lose the inevitable trade wars.

UKIP would like to close our borders and vet everyone who comes through against a points system - no other country does this or can do this, not even Australia - a country that has a half a dozen different immigration systems.

Farage just doesn't understand how immigration systems actually work worldwide and his theories on trade are a complete joke. People were having to stifle laughs during is recent speech on Africa. The man is an ignoramus.

	<TEXT> Driverless cars are basically developing the sensors and control systems we need to make home robotics a reality, but we're not as close to working consumer or business technology in both fields as it seems. 

Google's car still can't handle adverse weather or traffic lights with the Sun behind them, and extensive, timely, satellite scans of the route it's driving are required before it can traverse them.

VR headsets suffer from the 3DTV/4k problem, you need content and no one is developing enough of it, and the kit is awkward to use. It reminds me to a certain extent of early 80s video games - cool, innovative, but not ready for the mass market.

I could be wrong but I suspect both technologies will lead to the creation of revolutionary technologies but won't be as popular as it seems now in themselves mainly because the barriers to consumer adoption are high. 

Most revelatory technologies solve problems that a large body of people have - which leads to fast adoption and quickly declining prices, others start out as premium products and gradually become affordable, but I'm not certain there is a premium market for driverless cars, even the business transport market is tenuous outside of rail. So I suspect the market for driverless will look a lot more like Tesla than Ford. The number of technology companies in the game suggests the IP in the market is valuable in and of itself even if it doesn't lead to a product.

If we couldn't get people to wear 3D glasses long term will people accept VR headsets?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Honestly I think the question is irrelevant, although I sympathise with the view, because the more important question is "how can you have free trade for businesses without a free labour market for people?"

The free labour market was never going to help anyone that didn't recognise that to extract personal benefit from it that they were going to have to increase their skills and become a more marketable commodity in the workforce.

The government stepped in to fill the gap but was unable to increase the minimum wage adequately to balance the payouts to only the worst affected. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm slightly wary of the wealthy pensioners arguments that the LibDems were making when in government (I wondered what they wanted). Generally speaking applying means testing to anything adds layers of bureaucracy that often inflict more inequalities than they solve, and I can't see any evidence that it's a huge enough problem to justify the staff time required. 

Are there really hordes of wealthy pensioner processing reams of paperwork for benefits they don't need? 

All that said if its a problem that can be tackled with minimal extra expenditure and the rules around it aren't so tight that they disenfranchise people on the dividing line then I have no strong objection. </TEXT>

- Free childcare.

- Increased skills training for post baby parents.

- More child friendly public spaces.

- Increased maternity and paternity leave.

- Tax breaks for third children.

- Reduce road tax for families of a certain size.

- Improve child benefit for third and fourth children while reducing it for the first and second child - basically reverse the existing scale and define it by income level.

- Reduce stamp duty for families above a certain size. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Essentially the only group that pays in more than it takes out is working people between 35 and 45. Immigration is doing a great job of filling in the gap in the short term, but to fill in the long term gap we need to have more kids (we basically need more middle class kids so we need to incentivise certain economic groups to have kids). 

Incentivising having more kids is important to the long term goal of expanding the middle section of the workforce.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Its the reason national economies don't work like household accounts - government spending is 46% of the economy and the public sector is the single largest employer of young people. 

Basically if you stop shopping at Tesco you don't have to worry about Tesco going under. If you're a government that's a real concern so you have to be very careful. An awful lot of jobs depend on public infrastructure, so cutting spending often increases the problem.

Average size of pension pot has actually fallen since 2010 - people are putting in less and less. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Mainly avoid attempts at one hit solutions, black and white answers, or demonising groups of people as 'the problem' - there are no simple solutions - you have to pull gently on lots of economic leavers not hard on a single one. Also not calling it a merry-go-round would also help since the entire economy is essentially a merry-go-round writ large.

Getting over the idea that national economies work like household accounts would really help and might actually allow people to see the real problems.

Immigration and the increasing birth rate suggest that the scale of the problem has slowed dramatically since 2000 when we were on the edge of not replacing our existing population, but we need:-

- Better education and skills training of all kinds - this lifts incomes, it really is that simple.
- Free education - burdening kids helps no one.
- Ending child poverty - your childhood economic status determines your lifetime earnings. 
- Rethink pensions and the retirement age - the current rate of growth is simply not sustainable. 
- Employers *have* to pay a living wage - we can't continue to subsidise low paid workers in the way we have.
- Reduce housing costs - they have to come down drastically everywhere at every level.
- Immigration - we need as many working age adults as we can get.
- Employment inequalities exist - they must end for everyone, we need to increase the workforce.
- Incentivise having more children - we really do need more people.

Broadly we need to get over the idea that there is such a thing as deserving and undeserving. Even if you pay into the system for 50 years you still take more from it than you put in - the gulf between input and output there is so huge that no increase in contributions will close it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Cameron can spin it that way and he would like this to be the reason so his government can have their solution which is clamping down on in-work benefits (and it also offers him an explanation for the fall of treasury receipts, the failure of their deficit reduction programme, and weak productivity and a host of other things). 

But as I've said [elsewhere](http://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/3bi039/the_majority_of_the_215bn_125_of_gdp_of_benefit/csmcpf8) the problem is far larger and far more complex than that. Reducing in work benefits increases poverty and that directly limits the earnings of the next generation of the workforce. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The UK workforce is 29.68 million of 64.1 million people. The remainder are under / over age or economically inactive (house parents, carers etcetera).

Literally less than half the country support the other half.

The issue that underlies the whole debate is child poverty and elder care. The average size of a pension pot in 2015 is 22,000, the average cost of caring for an elderly person where I live is 106,000 a year. 

Pensions are triple locked and can only go up, and any measure that tackles child poverty (the single defining issue for the earning prospects of the future workforce) has to raise the average salary of the poorest workers.

Broadly only societal group who don't take out more than they put in are the group aged 35 - 45, at the height of their earning potential, and there simply aren't enough of them to support the rest of society. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> One of the reasons (ignored by this article) that the growth in employment is happening at the lower end of the market is that more elderly people are working and seeking work - but its obviously more complicated that that.

The average pension pot is 22,000 the average cost of elder care in my part of the country is 106,000 a year. So even if you fall into the 'worked all their lives' category you're still drawing far more from the system than you could have put in.

The real problem is the age dependency ratio - we still don't have enough working adults to support the system overall no matter who you pay the money to and no matter if you think those in receipt of the money are deserving or not.
