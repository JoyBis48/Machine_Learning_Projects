	<TEXT> Not "plot", but plot.

A good non-anime example for me is *Arrested Development*, mainly due to how the narration ties the different plot points together. Is there anything like that in anime? </TEXT>

Here's Steins;Gate from [AniChart](http://anichart.net/archive/spring-11):
 
 Steins;Gate is set in the summer of 2010, approximately one year after the events that took place in Chaos;Head, in Akihabara.
 
 
 
 Steins;Gate is about a group of friends who have customized their microwave into a device that can send text messages to the past. As they perform different experiments, an organization named SERN, who has been doing their own research on time travel, tracks them down and now the characters have to find a way to avoid being captured by them.

From [MyAnimeList](http://myanimelist.net/anime/9253/Steins;Gate):

 The eccentric mad scientist Okabe, his childhood friend Mayuri, and the otaku hacker Daru have banded together to form the "Future Gadget Research Laboratory," and spend their days in a ramshackle laboratory hanging out and occasionally attempting to invent incredible futuristic gadgets. However, their claymore is a hydrator and their hair dryer flips breakers, and the only invention that's even remotely interesting is their Phone Microwave, which transforms bananas into oozing green gel. But when an experiment goes awry, the gang discovers that the Phone Microwave can also send text messages to the past. And what's more, the words they send can affect the flow of time and have unforeseen, far-reaching consequencesconsequences that Okabe may not be able to handle...

	<TEXT> I'd like to know if you know of any novels that are introspective where you really get to know what the main characters are feeling, but preferably without someone suffering from physical conditions, mental conditions, or tragedies, or being a coming-of-age story. Ending on an optimistic note would be a bonus. </TEXT>
