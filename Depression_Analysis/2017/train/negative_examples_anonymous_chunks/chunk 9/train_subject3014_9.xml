	<TEXT> I work I'm a supermarket that's located in a tourist town. The amount of "damaged" items that pile up everyday is simply astonishing to me. If a box of cereal has a small tear in it - the box, not the sealed bag inside - into the damage pile it goes.

The company I work for does give some edible food to the local food banks and donate non-edible food to pig farms, but I feel like there's more that could be done. Does anyone know of a way I can lobby to have them do more? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [TOMT] Fictional movie about Harry Houdini's son </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-05-18 05:08:11 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm pretty sure it's about Harry Houdini's son. 

The one scene I remember is where the kid picks the lock of a mailbox and crawls inside to hide from a guy chasing him with a knife. The knife guy finds the kid in the mailbox but can't get him to come out so he drops the knife in the mail slot.

Thanks for any help! </TEXT>
