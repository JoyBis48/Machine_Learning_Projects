	<TEXT> Yeah, the sous vide is much quicker. I've used the reverse sear oven method many times with bigger cuts like prime rib, excellent results </TEXT>

	<TEXT> First I rinsed the lamb and then pat it dry. I used salt, pepper, onion powder, sumac, and sliced raw garlic on both sides of the lamb, then vacuum sealed it with 1 tbs butter. Used my Anova sous vide to cook it at 125F for at least 1 hour (you can leave it in the water bath up to 3 hours). 

Once you put the lamb in, you can start on the crust. Wrap about 8-10 cloves of garlic with some olive oil in aluminum foil and throw in a 400F oven for 45 mins to an hour. It's going to make your house smell heavenly so be prepared. 

Once the garlic is done, place it in a bowl. Add 2-3 tbs of mustard (I used spicy brown) and about 1 tbs olive oil. Add any other seasonings you want... I used salt, pepper, and sumac to complement the flavors in the lamb. Mash everything together to make a thick paste.

Remove the lamb from the vacuum bag and pat it dry. Place in a roasting pan or on a baking sheet and generously smear the garlic paste all over the top. Then set your oven broiler to low, and put the lamb on the top rack for about 6 minutes (I had to move it a few times under my broiler to get an even sear).

Remove from broiler once the crust looks good to you, let it sit for 5 mins and then carve away.

Hope you enjoy!

	<TEXT> I sous vide it at 125F to account for the additional temp increase when putting it under the broiler to make the crust. Rare lamb is from 120-130F </TEXT>
