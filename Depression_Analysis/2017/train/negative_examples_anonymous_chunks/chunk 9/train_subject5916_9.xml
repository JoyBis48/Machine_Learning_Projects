	<TEXT> You were clear about one screenshot from one map that I shown that isn't even released yet.
However, it's pretty stupid to judge someone's mapping skills by one screenshot, don't you think? I've done a LOT of work in the past, and I was just testing the waters. Apparently Reddit didn't like it, so I scrapped the map and turned it into a humorous gag. 
Here's some of my work:
[Example 1](http://cloud-4.steamusercontent.com/ugc/34115979016804076/7FAA6125BCEF7B5BB45DFF6EE9AAF9107E6BBD54/)

[Example 3](http://cloud-2.steamusercontent.com/ugc/34114798216970247/2EE3EE18986D966221D45B5CEA9BBAB7726856A8/)

	<TEXT> Yes, it's inspired by COD AW greenband. But the layout is not even close to be the same, it's just the theme of the map only. I thought it would look interesting in CS:GO and steer away from the usual "warehouse" style. There are many COD inspired maps in CS:GO, however, it would be stupid to use COD's layouts. If you have any suggestions, feel free to let me know. I am working on quite a bunch of maps that don't employ "COD maps" style, so if people don't like this map I can just scrap it any time. </TEXT>

It would be stupid to add these maps over custom maps like de_zoo, de_resort as there is a monetary incentive and people actually put a lot of effort into making custom maps.

	<TEXT> Hello!
I'm a map maker, and I've done some original layouts myself in the past. However, this time I'm quite stuck.

I remember playing 1.6, but most of my experience was public and surf servers and I never used to care on what maps I was playing on, it was plain fun that I cared about.

Which 1.6/css maps would you like to see remade in CS:GO that have not yet been remade? I am looking for layout specific feedback, and not "nostalgia" driven maps.
Maps that had very good/competitive layouts but haven't made to CS:GO yet.

Here are some screenshots of my work -

	<TEXT> As a mapper, there are many common mistakes.
There are a lot of floaters (floating props, not aligned with the floor).
Nodraw textures visible without boosts.
Clipping is also bad, especially when you are 1 meter away from an obstacle and get magically blocked by the air. Clipping is basically adding invisible brushes (walls for nonmappers) so players can't access certain areas.
The custom textures are terrible. With today's standards, it's not that hard to add reflectivity (normal maps) to the textures and $detail annotation.
For that you would need to import texture to VTFEdit and export it as ENV file with normal maps generated, as easy as that. The rest is editing VMT file with notepad. He could also just simply add a line $detail wood and it would instantly make all his textures look 10x better.
Lastly, the map could be simplified. In CS:GO, maps don't look better if you spam trash props (clutter) over the map to make it better. It doesn't make it better by adding more window frames and pipes either. What makes a map good is the general simplicity of it, take an example of DE_SEASON. It is simple, utilizes reflective materials. Tuscan is very sharp as a map, more rounded edges would seperate it from CSS and CS 1.6. Take Toscan for example, noticed how it's more "round" than Tuscan? It allows for better smooth lighting.
He could also use vertigoblue_hdr or one of the default skyboxes instead of the one he uses right now, he just adds additional materials to pack to the file size.

"Engine capacity" is an old excuse, maps can look good and work well.
