	<TEXT> "And as a prudent man puts money by to serve as a provision for the material wants of his old age, so too he needs to lay up against the end of his days provision for the intellect. As the years go by, comparative values are found to alter: Time, says Sophocles, takes many things which once were pleasures and brings them nearer to pain. In the day when the strong men shall bow themselves, and desire shall fail, it will be a matter of yet more concern than now, whether one can say `my mind to me a kingdom is'; and whether the windows of the soul look out upon a broad and delightful landscape, or face nothing but a brick wall."

	<TEXT> Well, except about that "ending the war" thing, if you'd carefully read the article, he notes that Obama did his damndest to keep troops in Iraq:

The war indeed ended in 2011. But lets not forget that before (most of) the troops left, Obama begged al-Maliki to let U.S. forces stay beyond the deadline set in the Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA).

And then later, he took credit for withdrawing the troops that he had tried to keep there. </TEXT>
