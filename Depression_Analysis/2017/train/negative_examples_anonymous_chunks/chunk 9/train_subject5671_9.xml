	<TEXT> Typical self-centered, narcissistic purple. Think you're better than everyone. 

Purples are just bitter because they can't read. They see something shiny and get distracted. They see a button and push it without any care for the repercussions. You're just upset that you didn't become a blue our have the willpower to use your press for good...

You disgust me... *spits at ground* </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Those who have pushed the button but are still here....

Are you sad you pushed the button so early?
Do you find yourself clicking in the spot the button was previously?
Do you feel like a shell of your former self?

Please share your thoughts </TEXT>
