	<TEXT> This is the thing, if you live in a fair-sized city you'll have some choice, and you can usually find one store differentiating themselves from another in just this way. Or, you can always try a Chapters which seems to have a fairly big comic/graphic novel section these days (at least in my city) and has a bunch of kids' stuff. The linked story was just some guy establishing his feminist bona fides. "I get it! I really get it!" Yeah, because patriarchy. Not market forces or anything like that.

	<TEXT> Listen to this man.

Obviously if you just got the job, you're not going to quit right away, but I very strongly suggest you start looking for another job immediately. The thing about this kind of environment is that it's an emotional minefield and if and when you slip up (and sometimes, it's got nothing to do with you), it can blow up in your face very quickly and very badly. Start looking for another job pronto.

EDIT: Another point that probably should be added: Find out who the Queen Bee is and start kissing her ass. You won't beat her in this kind of environment, so CYA.

	<TEXT> "The essential act of war is destruction, not necessarily of human lives, but of the products of human labour. War is a way of shattering to pieces, or pouring into the stratosphere, or sinking in the depths of the sea, materials which might otherwise be used to make the masses too comfortable, and hence, in the long run, too intelligent. Even when weapons of war are not actually destroyed, their manufacture is still a convenient way of expending labour power without producing anything that can be consumed. A Floating Fortress, for example, has locked up in it the labour that would build several hundred cargo-ships. Ultimately it is scrapped as obsolete, never having brought any material benefit to anybody, and with further enormous labours another Floating Fortress is built. In principle the war effort is always so planned as to eat up any surplus that might exist after meeting the bare needs of the population. In practice the needs of the population are always underestimated, with the result that there is a chronic shortage of half the necessities of life; but this is looked on as an advantage. It is deliberate policy to keep even the favoured groups somewhere near the brink of hardship, because a general state of scarcity increases the importance of small privileges and thus magnifies the distinction between one group and another." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sigh.

In the last four years, blacks have held community protests against violence in Chicago; New York; Newark, New Jersey; Pittsburgh; Saginaw, Michigan; and Gary, Indiana. Indeed, theres a whole catalog of movies, albums, and sermons from a generation of directors, musicians, and religious leaders, each urging peace and order. **You may not have noticed black protests against crime and violence, but that doesnt mean they havent happened.** Black Americanslike everyone elseare concerned with what happens in their communities, and at a certain point, pundits who insist otherwise are either lying or willfully ignorant.

	<TEXT> It's a debate my friends and I love to have because there is no answer. 
One day it's one, the next day it's the other.

SPOILERS:

One of the big differences between the two is that GBU is a comedy, whereas OUATITW is a tragedy. In GBU, they kill the bad guy and get the money, in OUATITW, even though Harmonica gets his revenge, he will still carry around the tragedy of his brother's death, he doesn't stay with Jill, his friend dies and he doesn't get any money. There is some peace to be had in the revenge, but it's still a bummer of an ending. I think for that reason, GBU is more enjoyable, but I'd have a hard time claiming OUATITW isn't a better film. Just the shootout with Frank at the end with that music and, quite possibly, the greatest reveal in cinematic history. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> "For 200 years we have said to the Indian people who are fighting for their land, their life, their families and their right to be free: ''Lay down your arms, my friends, and then we will remain together. Only if you lay down your arms, my friends, can we then talk of peace and come to an agreement which will be good for you.''

When they laid down their arms, we murdered them. We lied to them. We cheated them out of their lands. We starved them into signing fraudulent agreements that we called treaties which we never kept. We turned them into beggars on a continent that gave life for as long as life can remember. And by any interpretation of history, however twisted, we did not do right. We were not lawful nor were we just in what we did. For them, we do not have to restore these people, we do not have to live up to some agreements, because it is given to us by virtue of our power to attack the rights of others, to take their property, to take their lives when they are trying to defend their land and liberty, and to make their virtues a crime and our own vices virtues.

But there is one thing which is beyond the reach of this perversity and that is the tremendous verdict of history. And history will surely judge us. But do we care? What kind of moral schizophrenia is it that allows us to shout at the top of our national voice for all the world to hear that we live up to our commitment when every page of history and when all the thirsty, starving, humiliating days and nights of the last 100 years in the lives of the American Indian contradict that voice?

It would seem that the respect for principle and the love of one's neighbor have become dysfunctional in this country of ours, and that all we have done, all that we have succeeded in accomplishing with our power is simply annihilating the hopes of the newborn countries in this world, as well as friends and enemies alike, that we're not humane, and that we do not live up to our agreements.

Perhaps at this moment you are saying to yourself what the hell has all this got to do with the Academy Awards? Why is this woman standing up here, ruining our evening, invading our lives with things that don't concern us, and that we don't care about? Wasting our time and money and intruding in our homes.

I think the answer to those unspoken questions is that the motion picture community has been as responsible as any for degrading the Indian and making a mockery of his character, describing his as savage, hostile and evil. It's hard enough for children to grow up in this world. When Indian children watch television, and they watch films, and when they see their race depicted as they are in films, their minds become injured in ways we can never know.

Recently there have been a few faltering steps to correct this situation, but too faltering and too few, so I, as a member in this profession, do not feel that I can as a citizen of the United States accept an award here tonight. I think awards in this country at this time are inappropriate to be received or given until the condition of the American Indian is drastically altered. If we are not our brother's keeper, at least let us not be his executioner.

I would have been here tonight to speak to you directly, but I felt that perhaps I could be of better use if I went to Wounded Knee to help forestall in whatever way I can the establishment of a peace which would be dishonorable as long as the rivers shall run and the grass shall grow.

I would hope that those who are listening would not look upon this as a rude intrusion, but as an earnest effort to focus attention on an issue that might very well determine whether or not this country has the right to say from this point forward we believe in the inalienable rights of all people to remain free and independent on lands that have supported their life beyond living memory.

Thank you for your kindness and your courtesy to Miss Littlefeather. Thank you and good night."

This statement was written by Marlon Brando for delivery at the Academy Awards ceremony where Mr. Brando refused an Oscar. The speaker, who read only a part of it, was Shasheen Littlefeather.

	<TEXT> After he rejected the racism of the NOI, he expanded his view to oppose injustice of all kinds, regardless of color. Here are some quotes along those lines:

We will work with anyone, with any group, no matter what their color is, as long as they are genuinely interested in taking the type of steps necessary to bring an end to the injustices that black people in this country are afflicted by. No matter what their color is, no matter what their political, economic or social philosophy is, as long as their aims and objectives are in the direction of destroying the vulturous system that has been sucking the blood of black people in this country, theyre all right with us. But if theyre in any way that compromising, dangerous type of person, then we think that they should be dealt with.

And:

"In my opinion, the young generation of whites, blacks, browns, whatever else there is, you're living at a time of extremism, a time of revolution, a time when there's got to be a change, people in power have misused it, and now there has to be a change. And a better world has to be built and the only way it's going to be built is with extreme methods. And I, for one, will joint in with anyone -- don't care what color you are -- as long as you want to change this miserable condition that exists on this earth." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Having studied Malcolm X for over ten years, your criticism of him as insane, violent and a racist is, simply put, completely and totally wrong. Malcolm X never advocated violence. Ever. Not once. He advocated self-defense in an era when black people were being hung from trees. While much has changed in the last 50 years, much also has not and I find his analysis prescient. Yes, there were looters and criminals among the rioters, but I find Malcolm's analysis quite a bit more interesting than your (not to be rude) typically simple-minded offhanded dismissal. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> On the other hand, Malcolm X understood the root causes of the violence 50 years ago:

*In America, the black community in which we live is not owned by us. The landlord is white. The merchant is white. In fact, the entire economy of the black community in the states is controlled by someone who doesnt even live there. The property that we live in is owned by someone else. The store that we trade with is operated by someone else. And these are the people who suck the economic blood of our community. And being in a position to suck the economic blood of our community, they control the radio programs that cater to us, they control the newspapers, the advertising, that cater to us. They control our minds. They end up controlling our civic organizations. They end up controlling us economically, politically, socially, mentally, and every other kind of way. They suck our blood like vultures.*

*And when you see the Blacks react, since the people who do this arent there, they react against their property. The property is the only thing thats there and they destroy it. And you get the impression over here that because they are destroying the property where they live, that they are destroying their own property. No. They cant get to the man, so they get at what he owns.*

*This doesnt say its intelligent. But whoever heard of a sociological explosion that was done intelligently and politely? And this is what youre trying to make the black man do. Youre trying to drive him into a ghetto and make him the victim of every kind of unjust condition imaginable. Then when he explodes, you want him to explode politely. You want him to explode according to somebodys ground rules. Why, youre dealing with the wrong man, and youre dealing with him at the wrong time in the wrong way.* </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There is a very good documentary about the topic called Wings of Defeat:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZNy4l2j-Yc

The link is an interesting essay, but I think it misses a key fact about the Kamikaze. It was an unsuccessful, desperation tactic where recalcitrant Japanese generals sent young boys to their deaths because they couldn't accept the fact that they had lost the war. After the first few strikes, the Americans simply changed their tactics. Only 19% of Kamikazes actually managed to hit a ship. Having said all of that, I certainly don't question the bravery of the pilots themselves but there's a tendency to glorify them and ignore the cowardice of the generals who sent them to their certain death for no good reason.

	<TEXT> Unfortunately, history teaches us that sometimes revolutions are necessary to overthrow a corrupt regime. Whether the Russian Revolution or the French Revolution or the American Revolution or the Spanish Revolution or what have you, after years of trying to work "within the system", eventually, after all other methods have failed, it's time to pick up a brick. The corruption has spread so far in Mexico that I don't see any alternative.

	<TEXT> Truly a masterpiece. I love this movie so much, everything about it from the backwards opening credits to the explosive ending is brilliantly executed. The dialogue, the acting, the music, the glowing box....so much awesome. I've seen it argued that this is the "last" film noir, from the period starting with Double Indemnity. </TEXT>

However the CBC is a taxpayer-funded organization, not a private corporation. Under the circumstances the report should be made public, or, the investigation itself should be conducted by the Feds and the results made public. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Another big fan here, it's certainly the greatest anti-Samurai film ever made. It's such a classic that it's hard to conceive of anybody remaking it, but Takashi Miike did, and if you like the original, I would recommend it, it's quite excellent.

	<TEXT> New York Times, March 15, 2010
By WYATT MASON

...By the time The Wire reached the end of its run, commentators
went from posing the coy question, Is The Wire the best show on
television? to making the bold statement,  The Wire is the best
show on television boldness that soon seemed spineless once
seemingly everyone defaulted to calling it simply, The best show in
television history. In the two years since The Wire concluded, a
pitched battle of ongoing praise has upped the comparative ante. If
likening Simon repeatedly to Dickens and Dreiser, Balzac and Tolstoy
and Shakespeare  hasnt proved adequately exalting, Bill Moyers
lately freshened things up by calling Simon our Edward Gibbon, while
the literary critic Walter Benn Michaels went so far as to suggest
that the beauty and difficulty of watching The Wire in English  the
multifarious 21st-century English of Baltimore detectives and drug
dealers  compares with that of reading Dante in 14th-century Italian.
It should go without saying that Duke; the University of California,
Berkeley; and, next term, Harvard, are offering courses on the series,
seminars focused not merely on the sophistication of its storytelling
but also on its sociological and political perspicacity...

Watch The Wire.
