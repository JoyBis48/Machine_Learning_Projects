	<TEXT> One of the best things you can do is to fix your body clock. You can do this in 1 day. Set an alarm clock for 7am and no matter how little sleep you get, wake up and don't go back to sleep for the whole day. Do what ever you have to and then go to be at a reasonable hour that night. 

For actually going to sleep, here's some advice:

Turn everything off in your room, computer, TV, everything that has a LED or a humming noise.

Then close your eyes and get comfortable. It's story time! 

Use your imagination, do something. Tell a story, come up with your ideal video game, direct a porno with you and Jessica Alba! Have fun with it, let your mind go. Remember being a kid and having these imagination sessions? There is no reason you can't do it again as an adult.

In fact, several times in doing this I've had epiphanies for work haha. The point is to let your body relax into sleep. Also stop drinking any form of caffeine after 5pm, that one caused massive problems for me for years.

Also it sounds cliche but a good diet and exercise does wonders for how well you sleep. I've been losing weight for the past 4 months and just eating better has given me solid nights sleep, which in turn gives me more energy for exercise when in turn means I'm more tired at night for sleep! It's cyclical! </TEXT>

Real time is tricky to recommend, but if you like the sort of harder hitting conversations from Daily Show and Last Week, then you'll probably like it.

Bill Maher can come off as a bit of an asshole, but I like his bluntness on the subject. Quite often the discussions put everyone out of their comfort zones and it can garner some actual discussion. 

Mind you, sometimes pandering nonsense can also occur. I watch it every week and I enjoy it every week, but I can get why people can't handle Maher. </TEXT>

They also tack on lots of project management buzz words. Gantt charts, scrums, sprints and cycles lol

I love that show so much, I can forgive the artistic licence they used for the compression stuff because they need a piece of revolutionary technology which doesn't already exist. So I have no problem with it.

Since compression technology has real world applications, cracking it in the show is akin to cracking cold fusion and thus makes the impact of Pied Piper more enjoyable to watch. </TEXT>

But the show couldn't figure out what it was 2 months in. They kept on switching around the pacing and the format. The round table discussion didn't work, Larry was too soft on people spouting nonsense for a hard hitting TV show and there was too much pandering for a decent comedy.

Daily show, real time and last week tonight are going to have to do for now. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I quit back in 2013, but I can for sure speak up about this because I'm an Australian.

In case you didn't know why that's relevant, in Australia we have passed legislation requiring all tobacco products to be plain packaging and have [massive pictures of disgusting smoking related disfigurements on them](https://www.google.com.au/search?q=australian+cigarettes safe=active biw=1222 bih=602 source=lnms tbm=isch sa=X ei=iOWeVceHJIbg8AW6pLDACQ ved=0CAYQ_AUoAQ gws_rd=cr) (**warning NSFW, gross stuff**). We also have pretty specific rules when it comes [to packaging and marketting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cigarette_packets_in_Australia).

I'm not sure what other counties do, but it's kinda intense here down under.

So anyway, how did it feel? I felt nothing and I didn't care. I think I can safely say that there is no smoker alive who has ever seen the warnings and said "Oh shit, it causes cancer? I better not buy this".

We all fucking know how dangerous they are and the majority of us don't fucking care. We're not thinking that far ahead, we're just trying to enjoy a smoke. When you have a drink after a long day at work, do you think to consider the liver damage sustained over a period of time?

So I see the packaging changes as a way to ward off young people from smoking. But I think the social stigmatisation of smoking does more than the packaging ever could. Nearly all of my smoker mates quit smoking and I think it's to do with how our current society reacts towards smokers.

Now if we could only point that stigma towards the junk food industry.... </TEXT>

My friends job during my fatness was to not judge me and not tease me but if I were to spout some fatlogic, they would rip it to shreds and if I said I needed advice, they were all over it.

Several of my friends worked as physical trainers and several were in the army, so any time I did have questions or queries I always had help. But as far as them coming to me? No, never.

Knowing myself, I would probably tell them "I appreciate that you care, but it's my choice to live like this. I know I need to lose weight and I'll do it when I'm good and ready."

Seriously, most of the time that I hear people complain about it, it's because they don't eat it correctly. Just because you take a bite out of an onion doesn't mean that onions are not tasty.

Thai fish cakes.

It was one of my mums favourite dishes so she did some research and tried to make it for the family.

Only problem was that she wrote the amount of coriander required wrong, she put in 4 times the amount needed. Now I don't know if you know what too much coriander tastes like, but suffice to say that even our dog, who loves eating shit, wouldn't touch them. </TEXT>

According to my FitBit, every work day I ascend and descend around 20-40 floors. All of which could be done with an elevator or escalator. 

As I started to get into shape, I also stopped taking the elevator/escalator and starter taking the stairs for these seemingly short journeys.

This has made a huge difference to my fitness, i've been gradually increasing the speed which I take the stairs and now I'm practically leaping up them. </TEXT>
