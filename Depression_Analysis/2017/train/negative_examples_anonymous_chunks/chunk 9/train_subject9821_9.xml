	<TEXT> You are retarded, you understand that the FBI wasnt involved right away as you suggest? Nor does that mean the FBI falsified anything in this case? Your article pertains to less than 100 cases, are you saying the FBI only dealt with 329 cases of DNA since forensics came around overturning less than 100? Furthermore your article mentions nothing about SHOES, its alot easier to identify a shoe print to a specific shoe than hair or bite marks to a specific person. Even your childish mind can see that difference. To claim a shoe print is the same catergory as hair or bite marks shows your ignorance. One can look at the PIC today and run a simple test to prove what kind of shoe it is. 





Your only evidence is a pin LOL, compared to the evidence against OJ, you really are an idiot, what about the witnesses, unexpained cuts on his hand, his bronco gone from the premise at the time of the murder, you are aware OJ has an alibi shortly before and after the murders but not during while a limo driver was beating down his door so he wasnt at home, the BRONCO chase scene and suicide note, unexplained cuts on his hand and his confession in book form, this is without mentioning DNA or motive???? you holding onto a pin LOL




I know this case much better than you. There is much more proof than a shoe print, including a ton of it not dealing with forensics but again their not RODGERs size as you conveinantly havent addressed. Plus you just make shit up like OJ not owning a pair of the shoes, knowledge doesnt come from making shit up and bad info from a bias documentary lol.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A)Of course there is proof. He admits this in the civil case





B)Your one article presented does not say shoe prints. Ir we assume thats what it meant, you are ignoring the rareity and condition of the shoe print




C)You do realize there is more evidence than DNA and prints





D)Why would he lie, obvious. Publicity, money, fame, boredom, insane.




E)The FBi may have introduced evidence in court its the Lapd who collected it. Specifically the gloves and blood samples. It was the LAPD who drew OJs blood days after the murder.




F)No i am testing the range of your conspiracy. But you have to see a connection here.





G)this is true policd have framed before. The evidence is so vast in this case that there was justification in stopping the investigation 





First, cmon with those childish comments "if you knew anything bout the case". No need for that, also you were wrong in that statement. We are having a decent debate but no room for that.




Also can you address the FBI admitting to falsing facts or some proof. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A)have you seen the pic of the shoe print? Furthermore they identified it as a bruno magla shoe before they knew OJ even owned a pair!!!




B)if rogers didnt need money why he is comiiting a double murder? If he is a successful criminal why would he wear rare shoes to a murder scene? You still havent adressed it wasnt his shoe size




C)no im not FBI but the evidence as well as the whole trial is documented so.....




D)OJ lied at a voluntery questioning before he was a suspect, plus why lie about Your Own Shoe collection if you hired someone else to do it? And rodgers is incapable of lying right




E)So you think its more crediable a mass conspiracy between the LAPD and the FBI was commited to frame OJ? You do realize the amount of different departments and people that dont intermingle would have to work together on this right




F)did the FBI fake the many incidents of OJs physical abuse against Nicole? And the infamous 911 call?




G)so OJ was clever enough to hide any connection to Rodgers but not clever enough to have an alibi? Lol </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yea 99.9% of those cases didnt involve an extremely expensive shoe where there were only 500 pairs or less at the time. Even less when you consider the size. Furthermore OJ lied about owning a pair, not only does his lying have a significant impact but why would a poor desperate for money Rogers be wearing those shoes? Its not his size either from what i understand.




Also very rarely is the print found in such prestine condition, so your rebuttal very well said does not hold alot of weight considering




EDIT on top of that there is much more evidence if it was just the shoe print i understand some what where you are coming from but there is so much more </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Im not saying those with certain history should be punished nor did i say it was a justification for AA. Again your conclusions are not drawn well from the statements made.




How do you see AA as punishment??




Again i was only remarking on your idiotic statement.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes i agree, people are reaping the benefits now that have no true idea why, and are privelged by it. Is it doing more harm than good now a days, i could agree with that. I hope to see this removed or changed in the future to include those in the majority that are hindered in other ways other than color. I do feels it adds to the lingering feeling of most blacks that most whites are racist, hence why there is AA, some would say.





But it has helped in positively effecting change imo. It was a positive thing upon its being implemented. I believe it had a direct effect on the culture change since that of the 60s. I also feel blacks are still the minority as far as population and see AA as a way to level the job searching playing field.





I have the biggest issue with job programs for inmates. Those who can leave jail to work in the real world. It hinders the average "free" citizens job opportunities by a decent amount. Since most inmates are black its a privelege rarely touched on, and a spit in the face of equal opportunity imo. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No, i dont know how you drew that conclusion. Your statement that every white has no connection to slavery is ludricous.




I support AA as it is a way to level the playing field. Equal rights is an issue that has been solved just recently, and that mind set is still prevalant. So in order to change the culture and mindset this is reasonable imo </TEXT>

	<TEXT> To be fair AA goes beyond slavery, and has to do with equal rights that were fairly recently made into a level playing field.




I understand where you are coming from though. I simply support AA because its an attempt to level the mind set caused by this very long history of unfairness to blacks. Is it in turn unfair to whites? Yes. Anyone who says it isnt is wrong. Is it nessacary to implement changes in cultures and mind sets? This is debateable but imo yes it is.




You make great points on other immigrants discriminated on. Take the irish for another case. But most of these immigrants had equal rights not offered to the blacks. Thats the difference. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The fact that the post lumps "white people" together is bias in itself. It also lumps wealth and race together, quite unfair.





I support AA but in some ways it punishes certain white people who had nothing to with slavery and are not racist </TEXT>
