	<TEXT> I got one of these last month and put it on the edge-pro at 15 degrees,very sharp but still dragged a bit.Yesterday I decided to try something  else,stropping with 400 then 1200 sand paper on a mouse pad followed by a regular stropping progression on leather then balsa wood.Worked nicely so I called it a day and sat down to browse Reddit where I saw this post,small world! Took it to work today and while it's no laser,and I,m no expert, I sure perked it up. Enjoy! </TEXT>

I actually chose this one because of the recommendation you gave Fujiwara on one of my previous posts.I wanted to try a patina on a carbon knife I could use at work,but didn't want to screw up an expensive knife.

	<TEXT> I have spent my whole life cooking on this concept.Never went to school and was lucky to train under some old school Euro chefs. My food doesn't win awards, but when the contest is over the chefs and judges come to me for their meal. I have asked friends many times, What are the best fundamental dishes of your life? Invariably, their response goes back to food prepared by a mother, a grandmother, a father, an aunt, or some other relative or friend. A main ingredient of those preparations is the love with which they are prepared. Those early tastes remain with you for the rest of your life. I stole that quote from the article but it is true,and I have made a good living on this concept. </TEXT>
