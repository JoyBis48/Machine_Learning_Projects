I'll even explain it to you, which I shouldn't, because you are being rude.

I never said the people making the jokes spoke for all americans as you suggested

I never once mentioned it

I never once mentioned the twitter jokes 

All I said was, as you cut and pasted, "Americans are bad winners and sore losers."

That was it.

So there it is as clear as day. There is no trolling, no attempts to disguise my comments or change them in anyway, that is it, quite clearly. </TEXT>

No I did not insult you off the bat - you sure you got the right user? Care to point that out?

I'll skip the middle part because it's just circlejerk stuff.

 I'm aware that I might cause you a whole lot of butthurt by asking you this, but why won't you just explain it?

Why would it cause me 'butthurt'?

Bizarre comment.

Why won't I explain it? 

As of now - because I don't believe you don't understand it. It would mean you are probably the only person on the thread who didn't get it (watch as people come out of the woodwork now).

Note: Try as you might what you wrote in the end was undoubtedly cringe material. Not le cringe, or anything like that, no, just clear cringe.

 It's basically become accepted fact by now.

Ow.

 Again, if you don't ever want to explain yourself that's fine, but when you refuse you better have some tissues handy, because you are going to be downvoted.

Oh no!

	<TEXT> Ah resort to insults. How wonderful.

No your comment is wrong. It doesn't matter how much you explain yourself. I've said this dozens of times on reddit. [I found one of my drunken rants about it too](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/2odqj4/the_sorry_cynical_state_of_movie_fandom_today/cmm6hq1)

Yes you are demanding, you are still demanding. You are trying to be superior and claim that you don't understand how my succinct (heh) response actually encompasses the main faults with the film in the eyes of the detractors.

It's hysterical.

Just admit you know exactly what I mean by that sentence. It's so simple. 

 Look buddy, we all know you can't explain that nonsense you typed out initially. It's basically become accepted fact by now.

Cringe.

I'll excuse your post pao insults and be the bigger man.

	<TEXT> You really need to be more succinct. Truly. 

I've written in tremendous detail about the concept of opinions on /r/movies, trust me you are adding nothing to it.

Your comment about the upvotes is just wrong. No matter the detail of the response you are not in any way more likely to get upvoted. 

And back to the main:

Your lack of understanding of the phrase is really painful to read. And if you genuinely believe I am incapable of explaining why that short sentence perfectly sums up why many regarded the film Fury Road as overrated then I don't know what to say.

A fucking infant could.

I choose not to. As I already explained, just because some fanboy demands it doesn't mean you have to do shit.

But if you do, because you will just get downvoted or ignored anyway, save your energy and always be succinct.

	<TEXT> Well it's unfortunately a fact of being on a default sub where the hivemind (which does exist as we have seen the last few days) latches onto certain things (QT, Nolan, McCon) and basically does not allow any dissenting opinion, no matter how much it is backed up.

This came up yesterday as well. And easily thousands of times before. I even wrote lengthy rants about it in the past

But just ignore the reality and throw in the term 'cute' and maybe that will make it all better. 



Sigh.

Some are sure. Still need a name to carry it. J.Edgar with James Frain in the lead might not have got the budget, or got made at all, and would have limped into nowhereland.

That I am right, without a doubt.

	<TEXT>  Yep, and I explained why not giving answers is stupid, damaging, and childlike.

No you didn't. Simple opinions are perfectly valid in many contexts. It's never about the simple opinion.

And yes I did explain quite succinctly the general reasons why people think the film is overrated - it just have went over your head.

Which is disturbing because it was quite simple.

And as for your last paragraph - oh christ it's like you never come to /r/movies at all. Yeah I upvoted him when he was in the negatives, some others did too, wow, it discounts nothing since the other 10000 posts doing the same didn't.

Don't make me fucking laugh.

But back to the main issue - you don't see how it is succinct? 

Really?

Be honest, not just internet argument (which unfortunately once again you really think you are right about this, and that I am wrong, which is just fucking disturbing), be honest - you don't understand how that response is succinct?

I just told you why I don't normally give answers.

 it's just unnecessarily cryptic

No it isn't. It's pretty succinct. 

 So yea, if you don't feel like explaining why you disliked a movie that's fine,

I repeat this - I never said one way of the other

 but you add absolutely nothing to the discussion by doing so.

Except I explained why some people don't like it.

 If all you care about is wether you get upvoted or downvoted for your comment, then don't even bother commenting in the first place.

Really? This is all you got now?
