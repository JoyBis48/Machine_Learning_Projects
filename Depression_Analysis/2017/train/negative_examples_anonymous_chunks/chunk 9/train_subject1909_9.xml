	<TITLE> [REQUEST] Final Fantasy VII </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-06-30 00:40:54 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I have never played a Final Fantasy game. I have always been a fan of RPGs and would like to try/play a JRPG but, unfortunately don't have money. Final Fantasy 7 if viewed by many as the greatest game ever made, and considered by many more the greatest RPG ever made. I do not have a PS4 so I will be unable to get the remake anyways, and would love to experience the original, even if it hasn't aged to well graphics wise. Many people complain that I haven't played the greatest RPG and I would love to join the circle jerk but I don't have the money.
