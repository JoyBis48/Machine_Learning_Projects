	<TEXT>  The Zionists have taught us all why Jews have been hated since the days of the Roman Empire, driven out of one community after another over the centuries

Your first sentence is saying that the actions of the Zionists are indicative of some trait of all jews that have caused them to be pariahs throughout history.  You aren't talking about "Zionists Jews" in this case because there were not Zionists "since the days of the Roman Empire".  You are the one with malicious intent.  You are trying to incite rage against all jews by implying that they have some sort of inherent character or cultural flaw that leads to them being persecuted. </TEXT>

The way democracy is supposed to work is that when the majority of citizens wants something, that's what they've get.  But when we are so concerned with politics that it inhibits us from even TRYING to get what we really want, it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.  We have to redefine in our own minds what is possible and stop limiting ourselves according to some arbitrary standard of "practicality". </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Woah dude.  You really need to check your attitude.  Where did I sign up to be your online therapist?  I thought I'd send you a few words of encouragement to hopefully make you think and get you on the right path of changing your thought patterns.  You could try being a little grateful that a stranger is willing to do that for you.

It sounds like you need more help than I can offer you via this correspondence.  Have you ever considered seeing a professional?  Having someone to talk to on a consistent basis can really help you to get in touch with your own feelings and thought patterns, and maybe uncover the root of the problems you are having.

I'll leave you with a few final words in the sincere hope that they help you: Ultimately, the only person that can make you happy is yourself.  You cannot control how other people will act, but you can always control your own reactions to what comes (or doesn't come) into your life.  Learning to observe and direct your own emotional state will dramatically effect the course of your life.  Most people want circumstances to change so they can feel better, but in reality, you have to feel better FIRST, by whatever means necessary, even if you have to "trick" yourself at first.  Once you've adjusted your attitude you will notice things will start going your way more and more often, until it becomes a natural flow.  It's the art of living.  I sincerely hope you think about what I'm saying and open yourself up to a new way of being. The universe WANTS you to be happy.  Everything you need to accomplish this is in your hands.  Bless you and good luck, brother. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  So your list includes people who left the government to work for Monsanto as evidence of some kind of revolving door. Quite the stretch if you ask me.

That's actually the definition of a "revolving door".

From the [wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolving_door_(politics\)) which I suggest you read:

 Industry, in turn, hires people out of government positions to gain personal access to government officials, seek favorable legislation/regulation and government contracts in exchange for high-paying employment offers, and get inside information on what is going on in government.

Moreover, you seemed to have cherry picked examples from the list that are the least incriminating.  Clarence Thomas, by the way, worked for Monsanto for 3 or 4, but the length of time is irrelevant.  Anytime a judge of a case is a former employee of a plaintiff in a trial, there is a real conflict of interest.  2 former FDA commissioners have also worked for Monsanto as well.  There are simply way too many connections to ignore.  This is clearly a case of the wolves guarding the hen house. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Labeling laws are kind of the last resort of people who are concerned about ecological effects.  The federal government is a revolving door with the biotech industry.  Look at [this chart](http://occupy-monsanto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/individual_monsanto_federal_position-large.jpg) for details.  Because of the governments unwillingness to impose rigorous testing standards, and instead rely on the companies' own research to approve new strains, the only option a concerned citizen has is to avoid supporting the industry with their purchasing power.  Of course, this is very difficult to do if we don't have knowledge of which products contain GMOs, and that's the way they like it. </TEXT>

Plants are bred to be resistant to glyphosate herbicides.  Farmers begin spraying massive amounts of glyphosates on their crops due to the resistance.  The targeted weeds evolve resistance to the herbicide.  Monsanto creates stronger herbicide and new crops with resistance to this herbicide.  The cycle repeats.  As the herbicides get stronger and stronger the collateral damage to the ecosystem gets higher.  These herbicides are already known to cause damage to certain insect life. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Bill THANK YOU for speaking up on this.  Too many people here act like any kind of critical opposition or concern with GMOs is by definition "anti-science".  They have been able to effectively frame the debate about human health and for the most part ignore the environmental implications.  The precautionary principal should stand here, because we could be changing the ecosystem in an irrevocable way.

In your opinion, are scientists who are skeptical over the safety and efficacy of GMOs given a fair chance to research and present this research?  Is there some sort of systematic discrimination going on in the form of funding cuts or ostracization?  

Thank you again for speaking with bravery and integrity. </TEXT>

There are actually a ton of really awesome dairy alternatives.  For instance: [here's a really yummy vegan mac and cheese recipe](http://veganyumminess.com/creamy-vegan-mac-and-cheese/).

You don't have to go cold turkey or even ever completely give it up if you don't want, but reducing your meat and dairy consumption as you are comfortable is a huge help to animal welfare, and not to mention the environment!  Thanks for asking questions. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is why I don't call myself vegan even though I eat a 99.9% vegan diet.  Instead I say I eat a "plant-based diet", but every once in a blue moon I want to have a slice of pizza with real cheese, and I just do.  I don't feel bad about it and then I go right back to eating what I normally eat.  It doesn't have to be a dogma. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Moral objections are only one reason that people choose to be vegan.  Others include health and environmental concerns. Also, even if they do have moral objections to eating meat, they still might not tell you.  Like, if you object to say, abortion, and you're best friend just had one, you might just bite your tongue to avoid a conflict. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Where are you getting your information from?

I googled that exact quote and the only the people using that quote are from sites dedicated to bashing Jews, not from Jews themselves.

Here is the real text of the Talmud online: 
http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/talmud.htm

Now show me where in it, it says anything like that quote.  There isn't even a real conception in Jewish thought of a place called "Hell".  It's a more modern Christian concept, so this quote is highly dubious.

EDIT: and for the record, I've never ONCE heard a Jewish person refer to anyone as a "Goyim", I've ONLY heard it from people claiming that Jews regularly refer to the rest of the world by this word.  Jews really aren't the demons you're making them out to be.  I really suggest you open your heart and maybe try talking to some actual Jews to get their perspective. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Fuck this.  The Israeli government does not represent Jews as a whole.  Their name has been hijacked by Zionists.

Also, There is no legitimate reason to persecute anyone.  Here is the definition of persecute:

subject (someone) to hostility and ill-treatment, especially because of their race or political or religious beliefs.

Even if you can say without a doubt that the majority of members of any particular group are behaving badly, collective punishment is unfair and unhelpful.  It's unfair because of the members of that group that don't participate in this behaviour and may even speak out against it.  It's unhelpful because once you've stigmatized the entire group it causes an "us and them" division for both members of the persecuted group, and everyone else, which breaks down communication and bars finding real solutions. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> My intention is to become a teacher. What path to take? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-11-04 07:11:47 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I have been practicing yoga for over 5 years, and while I do go through phases of more and less active times in my practice, I see it as an integral part of my life's path.  I have been toying with the idea for some time to make the commitment to become a yoga teacher to share this joy with others.  Recently, I've made that commitment, declaring that I will do teacher training by my next birthday!

I don't know what form this will take, where it will be, or in what specific school I will study.  A note, I'm not necessarily looking to make a "career" out of this; my primary motivation is to deepen my practice and learn the skills I need to safely and effectively help others. I can see myself doing "by donation" classes in local parks.

A few questions come to mind at this point:

* What steps can I take today to move towards my goal?  I've browsed many websites, but I haven't found the one that looks perfect for me.  Still, I want to move forward
* Is "certification" a very important thing when looking for a teacher or school? As I said, I'm not necessarily looking for a job in the traditional sense.
*  Do I have to spend thousands of dollars on this?  Are there programs where I can volunteer for a reduced rate of teaching?
* What about choosing a "style"?  I want to learn all I can about a variety of yogic paths and not box myself in to a particular school.

Thank you for your thoughts. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's actually a tricky question and you'll get different answers depending on who you ask.  The first Zionists were secular and made a political argument for the creation of the state of Israel.  It is correct to say that modern Zionists are acting "in the name of Judaism", but not everyone agrees that they have the right to do that.  There are actually religious arguments *against* Zionism, such as [this group](http://www.nkusa.org/) lays out. </TEXT>

The day will come when no one is relying on a traditional job to survive.  We are reorganizing into self-sufficient sustainable communities.  The day will come when there is no one to run the grid power, and the servants will all leave the billionaires mansions to join these communities, and the billionaire will have to humble himself and walk down the hill to real community of human beings, beg forgiveness and ask to join. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The Powers That Be are extremely well organized and they thrive on chaos of the masses.  The more angry and scared people are, the easier it it to funnel their energy into their agenda.  As truth comes to light, the initial reaction is denial, followed by shock, followed by anger.  We need to take the next step, and come to a place of calm understanding.  From there we can begin to get together to take coordinated action to subvert the agenda.

There need not be one single, agreed upon plan, this is the MO of the power hoarders.  Instead we operate as [autonomous groups](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affinity_group) that can network when appropriate.  We need to use every means available to us.  If we get active, WE DON'T HAVE TO LIVE IN THE WORLD *THEY* WANT US TO.   Do not fall into the defeatist trap.  That is part of their plan.  This is our planet and it's time we take it back. </TEXT>
