	<TITLE> [Progress] 6'4'' 155-180=+25lbs in 4 months </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-07-17 22:42:03 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> First progress post. I lifted all of high school, on and off in college before getting religious about gaining in March

 [starting at 155] (http://imgur.com/Q1qxla9) and [Current at 180] (http://imgur.com/rUE6NZo)
6'4'' male, 22yo. 

Diet- eating anything I can, I haven't been counting calories. I stopped using protein shakes as I noticed I wouldn't eat much for a few hours after and started drinking 3 glasses of chocolate milk a day. For meat I have been doing chicken and pork, both are fairly cheap and I work them into various dishes. I'm aware I've probably gained a good amount of fat but I'm not worried about that yet since I was so underweight and don't have a gut yet. 

Lifting- squat and bench on 3x5, 3x3, 5-3-1 with warm up sets at bar and one plate each side. Curls, pull downs, single leg deadlift, calf raises, tricep extension, shrugs, lunges, all at 3x10.

main lifting improvements

bench- 180 max to 240 max

squat- 200 max to 250 max </TEXT>
