	<TEXT> My girlfriend is actually the true definition of curvy, with thinner waist and round hips, but she wants to lose some weight still.

Honestly I hope this fat acceptance craze dies down and people realize that leading a healthier lifestyle will better them. Im not saying everyone has to be a supermodel, but knowing the health risks of being overweight and trying to make a healthier you will lead to better happiness. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Now I'm a bit of a fanboy for J.R.R. Tolkien and Peter Jackson, I loved all the movies for Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit (the last is a better book though), but it will be a veeery cold day in hell before I read Fellowship of the Ring again.

Let me summarize; rolling green hills of The Shire, birthday party, Frodo gets the ring, rolling green hills of The Shire, walk around The Shire, rolling green hills of The Shire, Ring Wraiths, rolling green hills of The Shire, Tom Bombadil, a freaky forest... rolling green hills of The Bloody, God Damn Shire.

It continues like this for nearly the entire book. For anyone that has seen the movie before the book, you will get a third of the way through it and start getting annoyed that they arent out of The Shire yet, but wait, there's more of it! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> All that screaming is just for cameras. Chefs can be sued now for unhealthy working environments and abuse.

Also, as a cook in the fine dining industry, to hell with competitive cooking. That is not what food is about. Every level headed chef will tell you all food has a time and place.

Duck confit? Delicious French cuisine. Shitty McBurger? Good drunk food. It doesn't matter as long as you enjoy it. One of those cooks might brew up the best recipe for braised cow tongue, but if no one wants it, who cares? </TEXT>

No, I did not steal your kill with my rocket grab, I secured the kill you couldn't be bothered to aa for the kill!

I've taken a liking to playing balls deep aggressive Blitzcrank support, and the last few games have been nothing but adcs with zero follow up. I literally set up double kills and all the adc has to do, but doesn't, is show up, use an ability and aa, and bam, time to kill a turret. </TEXT>

Example, last year there was a cyclist that caused and died in a three car pile up during busy traffic near the city football stadium because making a left into incoming traffic is always a good idea. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I love hanging out with my friends and playing some games, watch a movie, get some takeout, whatever. Sometimes we split a few bowls, chat, and have a great time. Never once has anyone talked about how much they did/could smoke or harassed the others about doing more. Its entirely about the social experience for us and we love it. And we don't get together for the high, usually its to hang out or have a barbecue, fun stuff.

Edit: we aren't even typical stoners; I'm in college to be a chef, my best bro is a entertainer, and our friends are university students for engineering, music, etc. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have never seen such a misinformed post in my reddit experience.

Yes climate change is a big deal, but its definitely not very big as to why US is running short on water.

Many of the surface water sources are polluted, aquifers are nearly drained to sustain cities that shouldn't exist, such as Las Vegas and parts of California.

Whenever a governing body deems there is an excess of a water source (there is no such thing when it is one of the few things sustaining life on earth), they sign really shitty contracts to sell to Nestle for next to nothing.

The US is running out of water because of decades of corruption, greed, and mismanagement. </TEXT>
