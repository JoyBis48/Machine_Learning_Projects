	<TEXT> It will come and I look forward to using it. But these things have a LOT of bugs to work out, as complex systems like NXT and BitShares have shown. I give Ethereum years, not months, until there's a functional system that's fully tested and attractive to outsiders.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Wow, this is quite a testament (from the press release):

Some of the biggest digital currency exchanges have been hacked and the rest are looking over their shoulders says Banx Capital CEO and Founder Mark Lyford. BitShares is offering their SmartChain as a safe, level playing field for use by the whole industry. It can serve as backbone network to all the exchanges as a way for them to trade with and against each other. With shared order books we will have deeper markets, tighter spreads, and greater liquidity. And since our customers keep their own keys while trading on this network, combined with hierarchical multi-sig capabilities  we cant get hacked, and our customers cant get hacked. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is starting to remind me of the gubernatorial recall election in California in 2003 when 135 candidates appeared on the ballot. There can't be too many more potential second-tier candidates in the Republican Party; they're all running for president already. At this rate, someone's going to win a primary with a single digit percentage of the vote.  </TEXT>
