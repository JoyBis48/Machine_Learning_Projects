	<TEXT> Donald Trump represents the vulgarity of the the last 45 years of angry Republican populism distilled into one bottle: a foul brew of Nixon, Reagan, the Bushes, Gingrich, the Tea Party, etc.

To wit: pride in greed, narcissism, paranoia, a lust for power, a hunger for prestige, quick to anger, and reactionary military attack based on conspiracy theories and/or flimsy/manufactured evidence.

The GOP and those who fund them have built an America where a candidate such as Trump can even be taken seriously; it's left to all of us to deal with the results. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There are many who have a special interest in seeing that stories like these aren't widely distributed.

This is why *Salon*, *Talking Points Memo*, and even *Mother Jones* (for a time) were for so long effectively banned under the fallacious and Mod-imposed "Rehosted Content" rule. 

The de facto ban on *Salon* and *Talking Points Memo* was recently lifted, demonstrating that some Mods are receptive to reason. However, *Media Matters* (and others) still suffer under this artificial, Mod-imposed ban.

I believe that Reddit's /r/politics community should reflect *the community*, not the whims of Mods who seek to censor content which they may personally find distasteful. Reddit is meant to be a Free Marketplace of Ideas, based on user-submitted, user-curated content. 

Do others agree? </TEXT>

Why would Rand Paul, who evidently imagines himself a qualified candidate to lead the Executive Branch, consort with Cliven Bundy, who is proud to announce to everyone he meets that he "doesn't recognize the federal government as even existing"?

Rand Paul is clearly reaching deep into his father Ron Paul's well-worn bag of grifting tricks and "LIBERTY!"^TM dog-whistles. Those gimmicks still seem to work on the crowd of oddballs who have fallen for Ron Paul's innumerable scams and paranoid conspiracy theories for decades. </TEXT>

They've attempted to repeat their efforts at Reddit with some notable successes, particularly in "news" and "politics." Similar behind-the-scenes  "Digg Patriot" hijinks were revealed among right-wing extremist Mods, and (presumably as a result) the worst of them are no longer Mods there. 

Many of their hand-picked successors remain, however. These Mods remain quite fond of censoring legitimate user submissions under the flimsiest of pretexts if such stories do not align with their dogma, or reveal causes/personalities they support for what they are.

	<TEXT> Donald Trump is the personification of 1980s GOP greed and self-worshipping arrogance.

How fitting that he still finds ways to come ever closer to the pride in unvarnished avarice, malicious ignorance, and unrepentant braggadocio of that bygone era.

Right-Wing Nut-Jobs/Militias are making a lot of noise lately. Worse still, they've become VERY agitated at all developments in the news this past week  the shunning of the Confederate flag, the Obamacare ruling, the marriage rights ruling...

When these people get pissed, they go big. Anyone who doubts the rage and insanity that powers this crowd of [*The Turner Diaries*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Turner_Diaries) fantasists need only remember that after the Oklahoma City  Timothy McVeigh was apprehended wearing a "Sic Semper Tyrannus!" shirt.

	<TEXT> ... an explanation which the user community will never be able to *see*, as it's been removed. I don't get how the tautology isn't obvious here.

Leave the Mod-affixed label on if you must, but don't hide the content from everyone else.

Otherwise, it's just a matter of hiding behind a label with the direct intent of killing content, and further demonstration that some Mods enforce rules (which in some cases *they themselves* created) arbitrarily, with zero input from the user community.

Mods ***MUST*** be willing to defend and justify their decisions, not seek to deliberately hide them from the community's view. So, if you *must* label something, let the story stand so we as users can have a clearer vision of what the rules are and how they are applied.

You'd like us to obey the rules, right? How can we know what they are if you insist upon instantly hiding examples of violations behind a cloak of secrecy, in some cases in less time than it could have possibly taken for a Mod to read the article?

If Mod's decisions are justified, the logic of a rule's application should be self-evident, don't you agree? So why hide the content and the label away from public view?

If a Mod can act as judge, jury and executioner, how can we know that the Mod acted fairly and ethically, especially when the article is suddenly buried from the view of our user community? That makes it *seem* like there's something to hide. Those who cannot (or refuse to) justify their actions should not be the position to control user's access to content in the first place.

Is the need for Mod transparency on these decisions not clear? Do we disagree on that most basic of points? </TEXT>
