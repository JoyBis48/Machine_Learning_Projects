	<TEXT> Whoa, hey now...It's definitely a different take and I can respect any actor willing to take on a role that would undoubtedly be compared to such a memerable character...That being said, the Mads Mikkelsen lends a more reserved take on the character, which has paid off so far and is a service to the character. Whether the writing holds up in the future, one can only hope.  </TEXT>

You can stand on the shore shaking your fist at the ocean all you want but that tide's coming in. I agree that some games are really bad with this method but eventually the market will decide.

	<TEXT> My lens. The one pictured above, is it me or the lens?


I can only get things into focus if they are extremely close, is it my fault? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Why do I keep screwing up? 

1st- the camera I order is all Japanese. 
2nd-the lens I get is 4/3 not "micro" 4/3
3rd- the sd card I get isn't formatted for video recording.
4th- i don't understand how to use the lens. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have a 35mm f1.6 and a 14-45mm f3.5-5.6. I'm having trouble getting alot in focus with the latter it's usually only really close things like my guinea pig.  try to keep in mind that I'm just starting out so its most likely my fault that I'm doing something wrong. My preference would be to shoot in wide angles with a "deep depth if field." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> in my opinion you should record all of the auditions and have the actresses act out the crucial point in the movie and then pick up scene and have them improv that part but don't let them come in with something that they could have had prepared beforehand. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't know. When buying lenses online I wouldn't be able to distinguish good lenses from bad ones. I don't know what to look for.


Also are there any lenses that are good in action shots but bad in still shots or vise versa?



What is a short throw(as opposed to?)? </TEXT>
