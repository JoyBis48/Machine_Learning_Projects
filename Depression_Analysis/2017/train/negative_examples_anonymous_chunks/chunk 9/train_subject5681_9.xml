	<TEXT> There is so much more art and lore that only the creators have that cannot be seen on the wiki though! It'd be amazing to have the entire lore put together in a nice looking encyclopedia!   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> With Mortal Kombat 20+ years running and not a single book including the lore is out there. We need an MK Encyclopedia! Shawn Kittelsen has already said he'd love to author it, and with 20+ years and around 70 characters, us MK fans would love to have an at-hand hardback type book with everything based on the MK Lore at our hands! Signing this petition will let those up above (DC Comics, Shawn Kittelsen, Ed Boon, Netherrealm Studios, Etc) know that YOU want an MK Encyclopedia! </TEXT>
