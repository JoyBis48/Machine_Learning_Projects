	<TEXT> I had a professor back in college who swore by this book. I couldn't hear the end of how amazing it was and how McEwan demonstrated his masterful writing skills here. I started reading it yesterday, and am currently about halfway. Holy hell was he right. Every chapter is amazing concise and demonstrates everything that makes writing transformative. voice, POV, narrative distance, blah blah blah. Anyway, read it.  </TEXT>

So many more. The issue is that this trait can reasonably be argued in most any book considered decent. Even short stories show character development. I don't really agree with the the fact that Cormac McCarthy doesn't develop his characters, he just does it differently.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> How long did the technical aspects of the book take you to write? I know your background is in the sciences, but there seemed to be a lot of complicated formulas involved in this book. 

Also, did you intentionally write this book to read like a movie script?

Lastly, did you laugh when you realized that Matt Damon was going to play ANOTHER character trapped on a foreign planet? </TEXT>
