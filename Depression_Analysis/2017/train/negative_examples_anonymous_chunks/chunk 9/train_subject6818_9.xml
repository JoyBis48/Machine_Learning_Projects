	<TEXT> You need to remember that we have an arena building in a year.  We can't afford  rebuild right now.  We needed to dump.  Hinkle saw our weakness and exploited it.  1st round is my only issue.  JT is solid but expensive.  Landry is trash.  Stauskas wasn't right for our system at all.  He has confidence issues and our development staff sucks.  Nik was gonna be trash here.


To soon to speak on Rondo but he is no different than everyone praising mavericks for Williams. We needed to take a risk for more reasons than most know. If we are a .500 team next year...  Cousins is gonna lose it. 

We now have the deepest roster in 10 years. I'm OK with it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> From what I read the plan is to MLE Smith for 2.8. If we get that,  we receive a great deal while Smith still receives I think it was 10 mil all together. Smith, Rondo, Gay and Cousins are all friends. That win at all costs attitude may be good. We never know.  Josh smith seems to have calmed down a bit.  


The power of what being an underdog can do alot of a team. Every person has something to prove from name cleaning to all star nodding. 2.8 mil for a 12-8 pf is good money spent.  </TEXT>

No we didn't sign Koufos to play bench on this roster.  We signed him with anticipation of Smith. 

We are lacking at the 4 and Cousins can play 4.  Smith is a stretch 4. All depends on rotation.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Black bears are rather timid.  Mostly scared of humans.  They rarely attack.  So by asserting dominance over the bear by yelling, raising arms and jacket over head and being in groups scare the bear. Never really will you need to fight it. 


Brown bears will kill for territory, protection or anger.  Big bears with a bad temper. Never look an animal in the eye but never turn away.  Walk slowly backwards in a sign of retreat.  If the bear attacks,  play dead in fetal position protecting head and neck. 

None of these work if you surprise a bear or separate her and her kids.  You are in extreme danger. Never get in between a mama and her kids. Personally I'd physically fight back if this was the case.  </TEXT>

We also forget what adding this talent may do for Cousins.  He may just go off and be that superstar we are looking for in him. (more than already...  Nba championship carry superstar)  </TEXT>

Laying on top of my hand. 

Comforting and caressing it

Like burying my toes in the sand. 

As cool as the ocean mist

That left my face gently kissed

It is you that is my support 

And it is you who holds my head up high

I place my trust in you 

As I close my eyes and say goodnight. 

Purely white with total contrast

Of the smoke that my chimney billows. 

As the fireplace crackles. 

I find my comfort in you my pillows.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Cousins has 1% better FG average and is our first option.  We aren't bringing Smith on for points... We are bringing him on for boards and perimeter defense. Vet experience to boot. 

I hope Smith never accepts an Acy role.  I'd rather a Smith role. Play 4 and average 12 8 and I'd be content with that for 2.8 million... JT was almost 3x that and not as effective.  

Smith was a huge facilitator in Houstons playoff run.  Hit clutch shots and even,  dare I say,  looked like he had a 3pt shot going. He hasn't been in Atlanta for over 2 years and Detroit was a shit team for him where he felt he needed to shoot.  Maybe he will listen to his friends Rondo,  Gay and Cousins and play his role... 

I believe Smith makes a deal tomorrow or Wednesday. We will see but I truly believe he is our guy. You can have your 1/3 the ability PF that is exactly as he is advertised. 2.8 million for a guy who plays like a 2.8 million player.   I'd rather shop in the discount section and find a quality treasure. 2.8 million for a 6.5 million dollar player.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Josh smith has a higher FG% than Kobe...  (45%).  One predominantly a scorer and ones not so much.  Josh Smith isn't that reckless like people say.  He just was used to being the only option in atl so translated that to Detroit. Remember how bad Gays stats were when everyone wrote him off?  Josh smith's ceiling is ten times higher than Acys. Personally I'm not the biggest fan of Acy. Logically speaking,  why would you sign a guy who isn't even starting quality over a guy who was all star potential about 3 years ago? Choosing panda express over some homemade Chinese food!

We get a killer perimeter defender who has vet experience. We get him for super cheap and he already has established chemistry with 3 of our top players... Then there is Acy..  </TEXT>
