	<TEXT> I don't think bitter would be accurate to describe how I feel. Sure I wasn't singing its praises, but I wasn't exactly being hateful about it. It bothers me and I said so. Can't a person express dislike for something without being bitter? You seem determined to pigeonhole me as some bitter, twisted man-hating feminazi when that is not me at all </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Personally, I think dressing yourself and your kid up and going out in public isn't really something to warrant so much praise. Sure it's cute, but it doesn't make anyone the World's Best Parent. If I had a kid and my husband dressed up with him and got unending praise, I'd be a bit bothered because it's not really a great sacrifice to do that.

And I know this may just seem like I am trying contradict you but I fully intend to be that type of mum. Mostly because I will get fun out it too. But I would hate for people to think that *that* makes me a MOTY </TEXT>

	<TEXT> He was serving in Afghanistan at the time and we had a holiday in Italy organised during his leave. He bought the ring over the internet (through a reputable site) and had it mailed to his mum. His mum opened the package when it arrived to check that it was all good. She then repackaged it, popped on a different name and sent it to me. 

He told me to expect a package and it was for a friend serving with him. It was somehing he needed over there and he couldn't get it sent over any other way. This was a pretty normal thing as a lot of his army friends lived on Base and hated getig things sent there, so they used our address.

 Anyway, I was going to pop the package in my luggage, but he very non-chalantly suggested I put it in my carry on, just in case. 

When I got to Rome, after our reunion, I gave him the package and he casually tucked it into his bag. Throughout the rest of the trip he kept putting the package in plain sight, making it seem unopened...but he had taken the ring out and hidden it. 

We went on a cruise and he was coy about me using the safe, always making me guess the combinations...which I never could. 

And, as we went from port to port he always asked me if I was having fun that day, trying to pick the perfect day. Malta was definitely one of the best days and it was made better after he popped the question in a beautiful garden overlooking the bay near Valletta.


And the rest, they say, is history.

Edit: He didn't count on me checking his mail for him. I saw the credit card statement a week before I left </TEXT>

On Saturday I went to a market and ate brunch with a friend, then went and got a massage and bought a pot so I could transplant all the gorgeous daffodils blooming in my yard into it. Sunday, my husband and I sat in our PJs all day playing Pokemon together, got KFC for lunch and hen walked the dogs.
