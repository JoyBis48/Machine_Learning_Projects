	<TEXT> Thanks for giving my research some direction. My grandmother's grandfather would certainly have been born in the 1800's, but after seeing the pistol I figured it was WW1 Era or later. Cool piece of family history but I doubt it's worth much. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Grandmother says this revolver was owned by her grandfather. It's a US Revolver Co. .38 S W 5-shot top break revolver with pearl-looking grips. It's not in immaculate condition but I'd love some more information if any revolver guys could help me out. I have the serial number as well but I'd rather not post that so publicly.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I mean, as far as I can figure, you'll spend $200-300 in a decent barrel. Gunsmithing work is up for debate but from the prices I've seen around, installation and truing would put you in the $600-700 range total. And wouldn't you rather add to the collection anyway??? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well in that case it might be a good idea to call an experienced riflesmith and see what they have to say on the subject. Good luck though, we'd love to see the progress </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not much personal experience with such major gunsmithing, but I'll offer this: if the accuracy of the T3 from the factory is even remotely satisfactory, just sell your rifle and buy another one in your chosen caliber. There's a lot of work and money that would go into changing calibers. Certainly more money than purchasing a T3, especially if you'd add the funds gained from selling your current rig. Do with that what you wish, just my $0.02 </TEXT>
