	<TEXT> Anyone know of any good organizations in need (schools for the blind, homeless shelters, etc.) that I can either donate money to or, preferably, buy something and donate to? Recently came into a little money and I had some ideas (such as buying supplies for a school for the blind) but I'm not from Bangalore so I thought I might get some good ideas on here! I want to give to an organization that is trustworthy and that will put the money to the best use.  </TEXT>
