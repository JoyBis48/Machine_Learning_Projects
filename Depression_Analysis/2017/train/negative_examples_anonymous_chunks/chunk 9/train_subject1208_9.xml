	<TEXT> Honestly think this is Mos' magnum opus (no rhyme intended).

The lyricism is out of control. And premonitory, especially for 1999.

 Sixteen ounces to a pound, twenty more to a key,
 
 A five minute sentence hearing and you're no longer free.
 
 40% of Americans own a cell phone
 
 so they can hear everything that you say when you ain't home.
 
 I guess Michael Jackson was right, "You Are Not Alone".
 
 Rock your hardhat black cuz you in the Terrordome,
 
 Full of hard niggaz, large niggaz, dice tumblers
 
 Young teens in prison greens facin life numbers,
 
 Crack mothers, crack babies and AIDS patients,
 
 Young bloods can't spell but they could rock you in PlayStation.
 
 This new math is whippin motherfuckers' ass
 
 You wanna know how to rhyme you better learn how to add

It's mathematics. </TEXT>

The guy at the end of the video seemed to know him as well, and was treating him gently, like he's seen it before. I don't know if outright rage is symptom of any behavioral or psychological issues, but I wouldn't be surprised if this guy has had these kind of moments before. And that's not normal. </TEXT>

Americans (and Canadians) will be your best friend for the day just because you ordered their favourite beer. They'll strike up a conversation with you about golf because you wear a Calloway hat. I went to boarding school in the US and the number of friends I've made outside of America based solely on the school I went to is astounding.

It wasn't until a republican did a "history" on the amendment in the 50s/60s IIRC that people began interpreting it as "the right to have a gun". Up until then it was known as the Forgotten Amendment, because it was solely to do with the people's rights to "bear arms" against a tyrannical government.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Gaming journalism is probably bottom rung on the ladder of importance for the Guardian or TIME. They're far more concerned with making money so that they can insure their journalists in war zones, buy new equipment, offer competitive salaries for new hires etc. Clickbait pays for that by pageviews, upping the value of advertising on their site.

That could EASILY be done away with if people started paying for news on the internet like they do for newspapers. But people don't want to pay.

I run my own magazine. I've written bad reviews of restaurants and had them pull their advertising, putting me in the red for the quarter. Trust me, nobody likes doing it, but it's the only way to survive right now.

I wish people understood that instead of getting on their high horses and braying about stuff they aren't remotely familiar with.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  We live in (at least in the West) a society where any time a man does something against a woman it is given far too much attention... it helps to show that both genders are equally capable of doing horrible things and that it isn't just men doing it.

Any rational person knows this. MensRights is more than welcome to have that end of the market about male issues. I, and many others, don't need constant reminding that people can be cunts regardless of gender.

 When new people come to the sub, they tend to vent a lot because they're not used to having a place to talk about the things they experience.

For this exact reason, the sub has done more harm than good, as that venting has evolved into a weird conspiracy that feminism is actively trying to suppress male issues and vice versa. The reactionary women-bashing by some has become a trademark, not just on reddit, but in the media as well. One can vent without perpetuating the idea that men concerned with male issues are diametrically opposed to female issues.

 they're talking about the double-standard that an athlete is going through because he was assaulted and had the audacity to hit a woman back after she kicked and punched him

Again, another thing I believe does more harm than good. "Equal rights and equal lefts" is massively popular. I think the manly thing to do when a (presumably weaker) woman assaults you is to restrain her instead of punching her.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Unfortunately I feel a distinct separation from that sub these days. When I first got on Reddit it was awesome, but it's become associated with values I actively dislike. The top posts usually have something to do with injustices perpetrated by women against men, and I just don't feel those are the things that deserve much attention.

I love women. I love feminists. Not the kind that go to Tumblr to conduct their slacktivism, but women who break gender stereotypes or devote their careers to causes beyond teaching "Women's Studies". One of my best friends, a volunteer abortion clinic defender, hates that stuff as much as I do. 

I want a place that recognizes the difference between working to better their respective gender, and a place that bitches about the problems affecting their gender. I'm not sure /r/mensrights qualifies at this point. Two years ago it certainly did. Notsomuch these days.

EDIT: literally just checked /r/all and there's a top post from /r/mensrights about how female models make more than male models. EXACTLY what I'm talking about.  </TEXT>
