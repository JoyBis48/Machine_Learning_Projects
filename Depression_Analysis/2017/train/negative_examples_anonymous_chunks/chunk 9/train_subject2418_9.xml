	<TEXT> I just started working for a multi-billion dollar company in beauty and cosmetics. The company is 85% women, I am 100% man.

Today, in a monthly update the VP meeting, I joked, "it's strange to me that a multi-billion dollar beauty and cosmetics company provides employees with single-ply toilet paper."

I think it's fair to say my days are numbered.
