	<TEXT> When you have people drunk driving 2, 3, 4, and 5 times - then obviously the answer is, in fact, harsher and more effective laws, rather than the current catch-and-release system where they pay a piddling fine and then just drive without a license for a year. 

When someone knows their staring down never having a license again, or a double-digit stay in prison, they reconsider their actions. If they can't reconsider their actions, they should be removed from where they can hurt others and themselves. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> culturally catastrophic to have the ephemera of a previous century squatting possessively on the cultural stage and refusing to allow this surely unprecedented era to develop a culture of its own, relevant and sufficient to its times.

I think this shows a supreme misunderstanding of what 21st century culture is: it's less a "let's invent new art!" and more a "let's remix and reimagine previous art in ways that were not conceived of when it was made." 

I guarantee you if you showed early comics creators something like Flashpoint Paradox or Gods and Monsters, they'd be totally aghast and state that they have nothing to do with such a vile thing. 

That said, Moore has always been a bit of a curmudgeon (to put it mildly!) and his work controversial. It's kind of his thing to be controversial. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We could start treating driving as a privilege (which it is) instead of as a right (Which it is not), and tell people that there's now zero tolerance for DUI. You drive drunk, no license for you, ever, with absolutely zero tolerance. Get caught driving without a license, 20 years in lockup, no parole. 

in 2013, *10 thousand fucking people* died in america due to drink driving. More than three 9/11's. Hitting some drunk with a thousand dollar fine and a slap on the wrist isn't cutting it. We need to treat drunk driving as the serious public health risk it is.

And before any drunk-splainers show up to say how it'd "ruin some poor guy's life" to not be able to drive around, tough shit. The thousands of dead people's lives are gone, not ruined, and them and their loved ones the people you should be concerned for, not drunks. </TEXT>

I tell him "we don't have a crane or anything, we'll have to make some kind of makeshift lift to get it out of the truck and then into the garage"

he says "i'll carry it." Picks up the fucking engine, grunts, and *walks it into the garage* about thirty feet away and then sets it down. I was both impressed and mildly horrified.

He also does metal casting, and sometimes pours enormous (gallon+) containers of boiling metal by himself, with the only safety precaution being someone else there in case he pours molten metal all over his legs by accident. So far, so good on accidents, though. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> there's a few options, here, that would make sense:

1. His parents had some kind of magic worked on him before he was born, that made him as he is in terms of being able to do magic. If this is intentional or not is up to you.

2. He was kidnapped by a (evil? merely insane?) wizard and experimented on, leaving him changed in a fundamental way. His parents were able to have him rescued (or, he rescued himself, or they paid a ransom, or what have you)

3. A god/demon blessed/cursed him for some sacrilege or heresy or offering. This should be a huge deal, something that totally changed his entire life and existence. It'd be something the character would have a borderline obsession with.

4. Alternatively, if he's rich enough, he might have just bought or had made an elixir by some alchemist.

5. A mysterious artifact of questionable origin makes him able to do magery, and without it he is powerless. The unusual background would be how he got that artifact, discovered it's powers, etc.

The key would be to add some flavor to it through quirks or actual disadvantages to offset it, though these need not be very game-changing. </TEXT>

Would you all like me to do a quiz for every episode that airs (which would be a LOT of quizzes in a very short time!) or would you like me to do a big final quiz for the entirety of 14B? 

Bear in mind, if TeenNick/MTV Canada doesn't put the episodes online right away, this entire question is moot, of course. I only watch the show online. 

Anyway, I hope everyone's having a great summer and is looking forward to 14B. I know I am.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> i'd say the difficulty isn't in setting up the heroes (though some of them have pretty bizarre abilities if i remember right) but rather in capturing the "feel" of the game itself.

probably one of the few gurps scenarios that would need some amount of house ruling to deal with properly. Key elements would include summoning in "trash" monsters to kill, and the idea of the turrets. I'd expect the overall fight to be pretty short one way or the other unless you came up with some kind of rules-based respawn system.

That said i don't see any reason this couldn't work, though the trash mobs might present quite a bit of book-keeping and a bit of a balance issue (you need them to be tough enough to be a challenge, but not so tough as to be to hard to kill). A similar set of problems exist for the turrets - it'd be very easy for them to be incredibly lethal.  </TEXT>

They know people inside, it's a reasonably safe environment (from the perspective of murder, at any rate) and they know how to work within the confines of the system. If someone's spent most of his life in jail, going back probably doesn't seem so bad. 

Either way, even if tomorrow we instituted drastic changes in the system, there'd still be an enormous population of people damaged by the previous system, who would have to be dealt with in some way.  </TEXT>

Hell, i was always taught that if someone was in a car crash, the last thing you did was move or touch them if you weren't trained to do so, because of the risk of worsening injuries.

Sadly she did not approve getting it to stick by the door.

I generally have zero hassles and zero bullshit in public because of that; people know i have nothing of value, and i look deranged enough that bothering me seems like more work than it's worth.

That said, i never make eye contact with anyone, i always act very evasive about it. I find it puts people on edge if you never look them in the eye. I also talk to quiet, so they have to strain to hear me and lean in, which also makes them uncomfortable. 

Concerning one's self with the comfort of others is the first step to making yourself vulnerable to the depredations of others.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Would get slightly more karma to paint it as "cop ambushed", but certainly that angle would work as well. Probably a good headline (for attention grabbing) would be like "Cop opens fire on car of black teenagers in Saint Louis" which would hit all the buttons.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Posted because this is 100% the kind of bullshit i hate in the media:

The Rachel Dolezal story was huge, this guy's name gets dragged through the mud, and there's one shitty, short article that doesn't even MENTION IN THE ORIGINAL TITLE that he's her brother talking about how the charges have been dismissed.

Crock of shit, yo. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I suspect this data's totally bullshit, for a few reasons:

1. There's many, many, many more "normal people" than there are politicians, criminals, etc. It's like saying "most of the requests are from people who make  1,000,000  a year in income" - well, yeah, of course.

2. There's really no reason to know why or for what cause someone put in the request, or even *who* really put in the request. For all we know this could be due to some privacy activism group going through the phonebook or sending in all their friends and family's names.  </TEXT>
