	<TITLE> Remove jars of foreign honey from outside the back door... </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-05-13 20:28:33 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> 

Believe it or not but honey brought in from overseas contains bacteria and spores that are very harmful to honeybees. If you leave a honey jar outside it encourages honeybees to feed on the remaining honey. There is a good possibility that this will infect the bee and in turn the bee will infect the rest of the colony resulting in death of the colony. Always wash out honey jars and dispose of them carefully.

I believe it is the same as the one on sale at the Bodleian's own shop: http://www.bodleianshop.co.uk/catalogsearch/result/?q=Tolkein+poster. It's a good reproduction if it's the same one - though I can't be 100% because the dark border isn't visible in the one in my home. It could have been cut off though. </TEXT>

The three vegan Members of the British Parliament (MPs) answer your questions. Are they afraid about how voters will react to their veganism? And whats the food like at the House of Commons?

* [Veganism in Politics 3: The Debate](http://theveganoption.org/2011/12/13/veganism-politics-british-parliament-world-vegan-day-mccarth/#more-230)

At the end of our last episode, Kerry McCarthy MP said shed asked for a debate in Parliament to mark World Vegan Day.

She was successful, and at the end of business on November 1st the House of Commons debated veganism. I was watching from the gallery.

In this episode, concluding our series of three about veganism in politics, we give our account of the debate. We explain whats going on, who everyone is, and tell you which of the MPs who spoke against is officially the least sexy Member of Parliament. </TEXT>

Tolkiens original dust-jacket design for The Hobbit is currently on public display as part of the Bodleian Librarys Marks of Genius exhibition.


It sits alongside other treasures of the Bodleian Library including a 1217 engrossment of Magna Carta, Shakespeares First Folio, the Gutenberg Bible, and much more.

The exhibition aims to look at ways in which attitudes towards genius are manifested in a number of remarkable books and manuscripts, and exploring how works of genius found in a university library can be acquired, collected and read.

It is located in the newly-opened Weston Library (Broad Street, Oxford), which houses the Bodleians archival collections including a substantial amount of Tolkiens papers. The exhibition will close 20 September 2015. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> weren't enough Anglo-Saxons to completely dominate the native gene pool

This article goes into more detail: 

* ['Myths of British ancestry' by Stephen Oppenheimer in *Prospect* magazine](http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/features/mythsofbritishancestry)

But **the English still derive most of their current gene pool from the same early Basque source as the Irish, Welsh and Scots**. These figures are at odds with the modern perceptions of Celtic and Anglo-Saxon ethnicity based on more recent invasions. There were many later invasions, as well as less violent immigrations, and each left a genetic signal, but no individual event contributed much more than 5 per cent to our modern genetic mix.

More data for those interested can be found here:

* ['The Fine-Scale Genetic Structure of the British Population' - the results of a 20 year study, published in *Nature*](http://www.nature.com/articles/nature14230.epdf?referrer_access_token=wKgXQpHeV9hW7vEu63f_AdRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0MiE0_B2kFTYAb64eH_EPxJeiJzg7Mfl6MEBC6p_EUzUubrkOhRuO_XsZgBdONzb7JHIJr0qWq47bqvybwXlZOl6rT8e6_ZLRFU5Y1Usu-VzWwuPgZJTD4dXKpUe-mYsGEs0ilrxQAsV2B2ul0r6xu3s_FYkniPrbpBXUL0BRfdVSTwUmzwczIBMq4BOd92qWIbb9YOg3Tcn-l4GUTiaSbT tracking_referrer=www.theguardian.com).

	<TEXT> A pioneer in Buddhist revival in India. He encouraged lower-caste Hindus to convert to Buddhism.

He was prominent in India's birth as an independent nation and wrote her constitution. 

Dr. Bhimrao Ambedkar, the great leader of the Dalits, was determined to liberate people from poverty, injustice and caste oppression. Between 1923 and 1956 he worked tirelessly in the Indian political system as an advocate for human rights, and rose to become the first Law Minister of the new Indian nation and the chief author of its Constitution. The new Constitution made untouchability illegal, but Dr. Ambedkar came to believe that true social change could only come by leaving behind the cultural and religious beliefs that justified the caste system. In 1956, shortly before his death, he initiated a wave of mass conversions to Buddhism  a spiritual tradition free of prejudice.

	<TEXT> Thank you. I found the contextualisation of it within walking meditation illuminating. I appreciated the tips for the walking meditation too. I hope to be able to try some of those approaches.

Thanisarro Bhikku. I'd been aware of some of his translations on Access to Insight but didn't know he has written on meditation practice, let alone so lucidly. The canonical works are very good for the Buddha essence yet it is this sort of Guru giving practical advice that is so valuable for the West/English speaking world which has less of a tradition in meditation compared to the East. The Buddha/buddhists of old were part of a yogic milieu that I believe 'shorthanded' canonical meditation advice. Teachers and writers on meditation should be treasured - particularly those using the language one speaks! 

Thank you very much for sharing. I shall revisit this and hopefully assist in some way to passing on the merit. Sadhu, ZFree2013! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Have you ever tried standing meditation in a more formal setting - as you do with your sitting meditation?

 From my cursory research on the subject it appears that there are some traditions that use standing meditation as a way to transition the awareness and mindfulness gained 'in the midst of stillness' to awareness and mindfulness 'in the midst of commotion'. 

There are two modes of Son Buddhist meditation: "Son in the midst of stillness" and "Son in the midst of commotion." I like to refer to them as simply the "quiet" and "active" modes of meditation. Quiet meditation commonly refers to traditional seated meditation but includes any meditative form where you're not moving. Active meditation refers to meditating while in motion in the midst of daily life.

Active meditation is considered more advanced and confers the advantage of not having to set aside a special time and place to meditate. Another great benefit is that once you have mastered being able to meditate wherever you are, you can begin to use meditation as a therapeutic coping mechanism to recover from unexpected surprises right on the spot and as a method of improving your way of communicating and behaving. In a word, active meditation is both healing and empowering.

Practically speaking, however, in order to get to this level we first have to learn how to meditate in a variety of physical postures. So today I'll share with you the method of meditating in a standing position.

	<TEXT> Thank you, that's all very helpful. It's something I'd like to focus more on though I don't believe it is much practised in my particular sangha - it certainly isn't taught at a formal level to the extent of my knowledge. I was just looking to accrue any information on the topic so I had some more sense of the tradition/context before broaching the subject with my fellow sangha members and/or exploring the practice by myself. 

Thank you again - I shall be investigating further. My interest was sparked in part by someone I met on retreat who said that when meditating outdoors he felt he got a lot of merit from a process of engaging in sitting meditation followed by standing meditation followed by walking meditation and repeating this once. Furthermore, there will be a retreat next year with a 'theme' of the archetype of the king and I thought that  a practice of standing meditation could in some way contribute. I believe my intuition came from how Nelson Mandela wrote in his autobiography of his experience seeing Haile Selassie:

The conference was officially opened by our host, His Imperial Majesty, who was dressed in an elaborate brocaded army uniform. I was surprised by how small the emperor appeared, but his dignity and confidence made him seem like the African giant that he was. It was the first time I had witnessed a head of state go through the formalities of his office, and I was fascinated. **He stood perfectly straight**, and inclined his head only slightly to indicate that he was listening. **Dignity was the hallmark of all his actions.**

The head inclining is contrary to the Buddha's 'elephant look' but I believe the rest could be evoked in a way congruent with right intention and I hope right view and action. 

Feel free to comment further if you'd like. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Sonnet 129, Shakespeare - 'The expense of spirit in a waste of shame...' </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-03-18 16:59:02 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> The expense of spirit in a waste of shame

Is lust in action; and till action, lust

Is perjured, murderous, bloody, full of blame,

Savage, extreme, rude, cruel, not to trust,

|

Enjoy'd no sooner but despised straight,

Past reason hunted, and no sooner had

Past reason hated, as a swallow'd bait

On purpose laid to make the taker mad;


|

Mad in pursuit and in possession so;

Had, having, and in quest to have, extreme;

A bliss in proof, and proved, a very woe;

Before, a joy proposed; behind, a dream.

|

|


    nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;All this the world well knows; yet none knows well

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;To shun the heaven that leads men to this hell.

	<TEXT> On thy stupendous summit, rock sublime!

That oer the channel reared, half way at sea

The mariner at early morning hails,

I would recline; while Fancy should go forth,

And represent the strange and awful hour

Of vast concussion; when the Omnipotent

Stretched forth his arm, and rent the solid hills,

Bidding the impetuous main flood rush between

The rifted shores, and from the continent

Eternally divided this green isle.

Imperial lord of the high southern coast!

From thy projecting head-land I would mark

Far in the east the shades of night disperse,

Melting and thinned, as from the dark blue wave

Emerging, brilliant rays of arrowy light

Dart from the horizon; when the glorious sun

Just lifts above it his resplendent orb.

Advances now, with feathery silver touched,

The rippling tide of flood; glisten the sands,

While, inmates of the chalky clefts that scar

Thy sides precipitous, with shrill harsh cry,

Their white wings glancing in the level beam,

The terns, and gulls, and tarrocks, seek their food,

And thy rough hollows echo to the voice

Of the gray choughs, and ever restless daws,

With clamor, not unlike the chiding hounds,

While the lone shepherd, and his baying dog,

Drive to thy turfy crest his bleating flock.

*

The high meridian of the day is past,

And Ocean now, reflecting the calm Heaven,

Is of cerulean hue; and murmurs low

The tide of ebb, upon the level sands.

The sloop, her angular canvas shifting still,

Catches the light and variable airs

That but a little crisp the summer sea,

Dimpling its tranquil surface.

	<TEXT> We're talking about the 20th/21st rather than the 15th century, your point about holy orders at Oxbridge is thus entirely irrelevant.

Relevant up to 1871 actually.

	<TEXT> The universities of Oxford and Cambridge of course used to be exclusively male. The fact that their professors had to take holy orders too perhaps makes considering it a 'non-religious school' dubious. 

Also worth considering in terms of social science is the differences between America, and the UK and Europe concerning the distinction between colleges and universities. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> 'A second Tory term, ...in the long term, could be the best thing possible for the Greens' </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> From [Caroline Lucas' interview in today's Guardian:](http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/feb/28/caroline-lucas-im-not-playing-about)

In May, she might well make trouble for the mainstream political parties. Lucas knows that if the Greens have a good election, it could be bad news for Labour and result in a Conservative victory. She says that a second Tory term is the last thing she wants, but, in the long term, it could be the best thing possible for the Greens if Labour lost. That wouldnt be the outcome I wished for. But I would think, Now, for heavens sake, Labour, you have to embrace electoral reform because we are operating under a voting system that is creaking at the seams, that is not fit for purpose. This would probably come in some form of proportional representation, which could only empower the Greens.

I can see the logic and think it might galvanise some former Labour voters toying with voting Green.
