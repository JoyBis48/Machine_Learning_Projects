	<TEXT> So i'm going computer to receiver to tv, and when I make a youtube video fullscreen it briefly gives me a black screen.  Seems like it temporarily loses connection.  I'm guessing it has to do with resolution variables, but its only through youtube.  Other online videos are fine, and youtube ad's are fine.  right when the ad finishes playing it goes black briefly.
  I never had this issue when plugged straight into my tv, and its fine when I use a monitor.  Its not the end of the world (it only lasts a few seconds)  I figure maybe there is some weird hdmi setting I'm missing. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The past day or so I've had lots of problems with Logarius.  Figured I'd take time to grind levels, my health was low and he'd almost one shot me, absolutely 2 shot me.  

I cranked up my health a bit and went back.  He didn't do any aoe orbs or the big close range skull.  He did do the small skull missiles when I approached, and his melee attacks.  I pretty much backed him in the corner and stun locked him the entire fight.

I guess I could have been playing way too passive when I had low health, but he used to do the aoe balls as I approached him.  I guess a wins a win, but it was a bit underwhelming.  I didn't even get to use the blood flasks I ground prior. </TEXT>

It isn't so much a marketing issue, and proper writers on big name games media sites already had policies to follow.

The weird thing is X youtuber can still get payed to make a YouTube video, they just can't give it a steam recommendation without disclosure.  Essentially what matters are how many people follow steam recommendations vs just watching their favorite youtube personalities. </TEXT>
