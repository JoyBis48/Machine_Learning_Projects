	<TEXT> It didn't have a transmission installed in it yet.  So, no.  The other car with the dyno sheet taped to the front made 588rwhp though; that was an FA20 with a Full Blown turbo kit.

There were several people joking though that the turbo wasn't big enough because folks could fit their hands between it and the fuse box.

In addition to the green one there were actually three 2JZ Supras, an old Cressida with a 2JZ swap and a 240SX with an SR20DETT (I think; I'm not as familiar with Nissans).  And an R32 Skyline GTR.  And a new GTR, a ZR1, a C6 Z06... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The 86 platform vehicles come either as a manual or a traditional automatic (torque converter).  Having paddles does not make them "semi-automatic" or a DCT/MCT.  Many automatic transmission vehicles come with paddles these days.  That's not to say the transmission isn't good, though.  You will however notice a significant difference due to the lower gearing of the automatic and the rear end used in the automatic cars (which is why they also get substantially better gas mileage than the manual).  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I looked at it from the perspective of taking four pounds (I have the Raceseng) off the very front of the car - not so much for the rotating mass benefit but the improvement to the polar moment of inertia and CG of the vehicle (between the stock muffler-single delete and spare/tool removal that's almost 60 lbs off the extreme rear of the car).  Balancing that in the engine bay is harder and more expensive but every little bit helps.  Up front I did the pulley for -4 lbs and LiFePO4 batt for -26 lbs but I also did Grimmspeed MC brace, STB and intake for a gain of around 4-5 lbs.  Net change up front then is -25 lbs give or take. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Carbon DS is actually smaller diameter so it has less chance of interference with whatever exhaust you might run.  But they cost basically 2x as much.  Both AL and CF are significantly lighter than stock though. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I disagree.  Yes, better traction makes the rear step out less, but as you grow in competence as a driver it means the limits are being raised.  Which allows for further improvement.  Driving at the limit on a closed course can be more fun than drifting at 15MPH, believe me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Honestly, no.  BUT, previous to the intake I was already OFT tuned Stage 1 93 octane, running an aFe panel filter and Mishimoto intake hose, LWCP, LiFePO4 battery, no spare, Berk single exit muffler delete, so the gain from the new full intake and revised OFT tune are probably lost in the noise. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When you're first learning, you complete braking before turn in and then accelerate once you reach the apex.  As you get on in experience, you will brake to the apex and accelerate at the apex/out of the turn.  You want to brake smoothly so that you settle the suspension going into the turn.  The braking forces will give the wheels turning - the front - slightly more traction, which is good for turn in.

The stock suspension setup is biased such that the rear will be loose in turns - hence those big drifts.  This is on any of the three 86s, but the FR-S is setup the most that way.  The BRZ and GT86 less so. </TEXT>
