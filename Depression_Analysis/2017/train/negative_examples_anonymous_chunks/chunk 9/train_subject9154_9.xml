	<TEXT> No dude. It is not. It is YOUR OPINION. You have already lost because you think an opinion is fact. I know the definition of a fact. What you have stated is not a fact. It is your opinion. Trying to give your opinion weight by calling it a fact is disingenuous  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's not a fact. That is your opinion that it can. It is not FACT. 

Opinions can be supported by facts- but what you have said is not a FACT, it is an OPINION. A fact would be listing statistics (ex: The results of the statistics are...) - the opinion would be the interpretation from those statistics which is "Age disparity can create a power imbalance" The key word being "can" 

You can keep calling it a fact all you want but it is simply your opinion. Calling it a fact doesn't add any more weight to your sentence. I'm not saying I disagree with your opinion, I agree with it kind of, but it isn't a fact. An opinion is defined as indicating a belief, view, sentiment, conception, which is what you are doing. 


It's a common problem people do when they are taking to give more weight to their opinions they say "The fact of the matter is..." or "The fact of..."  They are trying to give more weight to their opinion by stating it as fact- it's not though. It's just an opinion. It's an expression in the English language and a bad habit as it misinforms people to believe the follow statement is fact rather than the opinion that it is. 

Now before you argue further, I have a degree in English. I taught literacy and I most certainly know the difference between fact   opinion- but what you have said is not a FACT. 

I'm not disagreeing with the content of what you said, it just bothers me when people say something is a fact when it's just their opinion. Kind of like how some people get bothered when someone misspells their, they're, and there.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ugh WoW. I have such bad memories of wow. It reminds me of this time I was dating this girl, we'll call her wolverine since she liked to scratch my backs while fucking until my back was bleeding. I didn't mind, but it hurt when I showered. 

Anyway, her roommate, we'll call her Cynthia, was dating this guy named Steve who liked to play WoW a lot. No problem there, I played UO and Dark Age of Camelot, I like MMORPGS, we even all used to play Munchkin card game together- lots of fun. 

Anyway, The issues I have with WoW are that Steve, when we were all out getting to know each other bowling or some random double date, he says he has to go because there is an all important raid to do. 

This is why I dislike WoW. You're out in the real world with your girlfriend who wants to give you some pussy and you have to go on an emergency raid for some random item you might have a chance at getting.

	<TEXT> What? lol. I was being sarcastic. I was saying "Good job for looking for for all the misspellings out there [on reddit]. I upvoted you for it, buddy. It is hard work fixing everyone's grammar these days." 

Most people can spot whether a word should be plural or singular. I was making fun of you for pointing it out. I do not need to go to school for grammar, I teach it. I'm also not a stickler about it in unprofessional settings when I know what the person meant.  </TEXT>

Yeah it does. Well, I don't know anything about the media...I don'thave cable but I've always not liked the Confederate Flag, I respect people's right to have one, but if I see someone with one I pretty much assume they are racist. Kind of like seeing a guy with a Nazi tattoo on him. I pretty much think he's a racist asshole.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Tecmo Bowl (Story) </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-07-18 04:58:30 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> One of my earliest memories of playing video games was playing Tecmo Bowl and soon after Super Tecmo Bowl. In Super, it was the only game i could have the Browns win the Super Bowl, which I know will never happen in real life because of God. 

Anyway, I used to play my brother in Tecmo Bowl ALL THE TIME. Every day after school, Tecmo Bowl. Homework done? Tecmo Bowl. Can't sleep? Tecmo Bowl. I also had a black and blue arm for about a year of my life playing this game because every time I scored points my brother would punch me as hard as he could for every point I scored to deter me from winning the game or scoring points. He was five years older than me. I was conditioned into thinking I'd be punched for scoring points. So much so that when I grew older and tried to play Madden online I'd flinch if I scored a field goal or touchdown against someone. 

At this time, this is when I realized that people suck and there is no hope. So I played RPG's instead. Where I could solve puzzles instead of scoring touchdowns. This is my story of Tecmo Bowl. And fuck you Joseph.  

**TL;DR   Brother punched me for scoring points. Fuck you Joseph.**  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah that's what the new Wii U Mario World 3D game is like. If you die enough in a row you can get the super leaf. It doesn't make you invincible and you can still die, BUT, it does help you out immensely so you can beat the level. 

Still Super Mario World 3D is probably one of the better Mario Games.  </TEXT>

I would love to be able to use this with Ocarina of Time or other games like MegaMan in my counseling and large group teaching lessons. 

Using story invention as a way to help students retain information is wonderful I think. A lot of people knock on those who spend too much time with video games but it can be a great way to teach students.  </TEXT>

I don't understand this. I thought we've known for a while that Pluto was icy because of its far distance from the Sun, so wouldn't it be normal to assume there were ice mountains on Pluto? I mean, I'm assuming lots of people thought this. Was he joking or being sarcastic?  </TEXT>
