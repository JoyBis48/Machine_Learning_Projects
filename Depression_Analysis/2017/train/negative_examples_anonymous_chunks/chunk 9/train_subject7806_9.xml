	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I've been searching for one and found some links to products but they are either not commercial yet or very expensive!

* This [one](http://www.electronicsnews.com.au/Features/First-commercial-silver-ink-UV-cured-without-heat) was announced in 2012 but I can't find a link o buy it.
* This [one](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/catalog/product/aldrich/791873?lang=en region=US) costs $389 for 10 gm!
* And I don't know how to get this [one](http://www.conductivecompounds.com/uv-curable/z-904-ultraviolet-curable-anisotropic-conductive-ink.html), the company is not replying.

Can anyone help?

	<TEXT> My recommendation is to put a switch to change the mode of your shield between 3.3V (for the Due) and 5V (for the Mega).

Have you heard of the [1Sheeld](http://www.1sheeld.com)? It has that switch and the manufacturers share the schematic design to be open source, check it on [Github](https://github.com/Integreight/1Sheeld-Schematics-and-Board).  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I recommend the [1Sheeld](http://www.1sheeld.com) Arduino shield. It turns your smartphone's hardware into 40 different shields through an Android app.

So you have the sensors like a Gyroscope, Accelerometer, GPS, Proximity, Temperature (I don't know if you have that in the S4).
Also voice recognition, storing data, text to speech, posting on twitter, facebook, video streaming through Skype ... etc.

Check the list of [shields](http://1sheeld.com/shields/) and the getting started tutorial [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LlfBoycKE8).

I built with it some projects like a [candy grabber machine](http://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-create-your-own-candy-grabber-machine-using/), where I used the phone as a Gamepad controller for children to grab candy and teach them about Arduino and coding, it was a nice game in the maker faire. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Intel Galileo would be a great idea, if you code using Arduino IDE it sucks but I'll try Windows, thanks a lot! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Exactly, I want to control the ink jet as i control a CNC machine. So basically there are no open source drivers? Do I have to override the driver and control it with motors directly?
