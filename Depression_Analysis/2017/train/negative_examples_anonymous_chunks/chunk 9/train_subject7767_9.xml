	<TEXT> Hi guys, I've been looking into a simple home monitoring system.

I like what the Nest, etc. wifi cameras have to offer, but there are some big drawbacks that I don't want to deal with.

what I want is:

* Outdoor camera w/ 2 way audio ( it'll be placed under an overhang of a house, so only cold would be an issue.  I doubt it'll ever get directly wet.)
* Selective motion alerts
* **LOCAL** storage to my computer, no cloud or subscription fees
* remote access, view and control via mobile OS and web
* wifi setup and communication with my home network (to store the data on my computer).

From what I've seen, [this](http://www.amazon.com/Samsung-SmartCam-Outdoor-SNH-E6440BN-Camera/dp/B00P1NAPPQ/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics ie=UTF8 qid=1436402372 sr=1-1) is the closest thing I can find, but it only has a 32GB capacity (some say it can go to a 64GB) and I'm not sure how it works for accessing the data remotely or how you archive the data without removing the SD card.  The reviews are hit and miss as well.

Any suggestions? </TEXT>

Sure, if something DOES go wrong it's spendier than an old Chevy to fix, but it would be few and far between when it happens.

Diamonds have 0 intrinsic value.   There is no such thing as a used diamond.

The DeBeers company made a huge ad campaign a while back to make people think that they are rare and worth a lot of money.

They aren't rare, the supply (and therefore price) of them is controlled by one company.

Think of how many jewelry stores there are in the world.  When is the last time you saw one say, "sorry we're out of diamonds today because they are hard to come by and we didn't get any" </TEXT>

I've never been there, and they will never see a penny from me.

However, if someone bought an extra one and offered it too me, I'd eat it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My car has the same scratches in the same spot.  Its from fingernails and other stuff that's on my hands.  

I bought [this](http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B009OBCAW2?psc=1 redirect=true ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s00) and took a DC - USB power port next to the RCA inputs and connected them with a 3.5mm - RCA cable (I think it might have come with some, but I already had it).   It's 2x as loud as just the cable direct to the ports from my phone.  I had to turn up the car volume and the phone volume to the max to get good driving levels.  Now it's too loud at 50% car. 

You can probably get the curbed wheel repaired for less than $300

The only problem I've ever had was the slave cylinder failed at about 55k miles.  Normally that isn't too big of a deal, but it took out the master cylinder, the clutch and the flywheel with it.  So it was like a $4k repair.

Get that checked if it's a MT because apparently it's a known issue, but they won't do a recall on it, and WILL NOT cover the failure out of warranty.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> LiDAR and RADAR are both used by police and are picked up by good detectors.  Same principles apply.  If there is no signal to detect, it can't alert you.  If you are the only car in the lane, and a cop just powers in on briefly and only at you, the detector will go off, but it's too late. 

The false positives of detectors have gone down over the years, but it's not 100% fool proof. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> meh, in the city, it's probably 6 of one 1/2 dozen of the other.  The detectors can pick up false signals, and if the cop doesn't hold the laser on, you can detect it until he pops you.  By then it's too late.

Same goes for the app.  Someone has to see the trap being setup and use the app enough to report it.  I get a lot of false positives on there.  I wonder if cops report themselves then move on just to slow down the people using Waze. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When battery tech and cooled detector tech gets small enough.

Lasers suck up a good deal of power in most scientific applications.  Detectors in NIR and RAMAN spectroscopy usually need to be cooled to get the best sensitivity to get lower levels of detection.   </TEXT>
