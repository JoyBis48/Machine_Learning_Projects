	<TEXT> No.  There isn't. It is not ionizing radiation.  It has no more chance of giving you cancer than the heat from a stove will give you cancer.

But with RF radiation, theres already evidence that its an extremely unlikely carcinogen. For one thing, theres no plausible mechanism by which cell phones or Wi-Fi devices could cause cancer, said Leonard Finegold, a physics professor at Drexel University.

Its not just that we dont know exactly how RF waves would cause cancer. Its that theres no plausible way for it to happen without rewriting the laws of physics and biology. Its by the same reasoning that most scientists dismiss homeopathic medicine  at least the genuine kind thats so dilute theres nothing in it.

	<TEXT> Not much really.

The WiFi unit in your room is heating you up.  Just happens that the power is so low the effect is negligible and unnoticeable.

FCC regulations limit the maximum output of a consumer WiFi router to 1 watt (1000 mw).  That is not a lot of power.  Even small microwave ovens will be 700 watts so 700 times more powerful when it comes to heating things up versus your WiFi (and many microwave ovens go well over 1000 watts).

	<TEXT> Years ago my company was laying off my department and my boss was complicit in it.  He happily kept shrinking our department out of existence so he could make numbers show he was increasing profit.

It worked for two years.  Then when all but a couple (literally two) people were left his boss fired him for largely the same reason. Who needs a middle manager when there is no one to manage?
I had a moment of schadenfreude over that one but it was bittersweet.

And if you don't agree with me, that's because you never did the Zeppelin marathon. The Zepp-a-thon is when you sit you're ass down and listen to all nine Zep albums in a row."

Yeah. It's rock n' roll Hajj. The thing that every true fan must do at least once in their lifetime. The pilgrimage to heavy metal Mecca. The jams of Led Zeppelin are second to none. Just ask anyone from Oliver Stone to Paul Ryan and everyone in between. They sang songs about love, about Vikings. About Vikings making love. 

You know, they say that Led Zeppelin sold their souls to Satan. Come on guys, you know you did! There's no other way to explain your ungodly talent. I just want to say thank you because while you're in Hell, the human race will cherish your Heavenly jams until the end of time. It's a small price to pay. We love you. The best band ever. SOURCE: [Jack Black honoring Led Zeppelin in 2012 at the Kennedy Center to award them lifetime achievement awards](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta0gDfGb9u0)

So yeah, everyone has to do a Zepp-a-thon at least once in their life.

	<TEXT> Believe it or not there is plenty of market research to support selling things for $0.01 below a big, round number works.

Psychological pricing (also price ending, charm pricing) is a pricing/marketing strategy based on the theory that certain prices have a psychological impact. Retail prices are often expressed as "odd prices": a little less than a round number, e.g. $19.99 or 2.98. Consumers tend to perceive odd prices as being significantly lower than they actually are, tending to round to the next lowest monetary unit. Thus, prices such as $1.99 are associated with spending $1 rather than $2. The theory that drives this is that lower pricing such as this institutes greater demand than if consumers were perfectly rational. Psychological pricing is one cause of price points.

Remember though that HSBC laundered at least $881 million in Mexican drug cartel money and $660 million in prohibited transactions from Iran, Cuba, Sudan, Libya and Burma.  No one is guessing at this.  They admitted it.

The banks' laundering transactions were so brazen that the NSA probably could have spotted them from space. Breuer admitted that drug dealers would sometimes come to HSBC's Mexican branches and "deposit hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash, in a single day, into a single account, using boxes designed to fit the precise dimensions of the teller windows."

They paid a $1.9 billion fine which sounds like a lot but is about five weeks of income for them.

Number of people in jail for this -- 0

	<TEXT> ...that if 5% (arbitrary number) of the population is homosexual, and this is for no obvious valuable reason...

Others have already noted it is not a disorder because it does not harm the person or other people.  

As far as having no "obviously valuable reason" there is some evidence to suggest (and note we are talking from an evolutionary standpoint and why being homosexual was not selected against) a gay person in the family increased the survival likelihood of the family.  This is often referred to as the [Gay Uncle theory.](http://www.livescience.com/6106-gay-uncles-pass-genes.html)

Also, there is some evidence that [the gene that makes men gay makes women in their family more fecund](http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2004/oct/13/highereducation.research) (fertile...they have more kids).  That dovetails nicely with the Gay Uncle theory (now there is a male who can help support the larger family rather than be off worrying about his own).

In short, from an evolutionary point of view, there is a valuable reason to have gay people in your society.

	<TEXT> In the United States, the term "treaty" has a different, more restricted legal sense than exists in international law. United States law distinguishes what it calls treaties from executive agreement, congressional-executive agreements, and sole executive agreements. All four classes are equally treaties under international law; they are distinct only from the perspective of internal American law. The distinctions are primarily concerning their method of approval. Whereas treaties require advice and consent by two-thirds of the Senators present, sole executive agreements may be executed by the President acting alone. Some treaties grant the President the authority to fill in the gaps with executive agreements, rather than additional treaties or protocols. And finally, congressional-executive agreements require majority approval by both the House and the Senate, either before or after the treaty is signed by the President.  [SOURCE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty#United_States_law)

So, basically, a treaty is whatever the president wants to call it.  If it is inconvenient to get it passed as a treaty then no problem...call it something else and *poof*...problem solved. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Simply traveling at light speed does not require acceleration. Nothing in the question, or in your answers, supposes acceleration at all.

The OP wrote:

will humans ever be able to reach them?

All answers were considering that question.

How do you propose humans move at light speed without acceleration?

Now consider the Twin Paradox and acceleration breaking symmetry and you see why things with mass cannot go the speed of light.


Further, the ONLY things that need no acceleration are massless particles.  Anything with mass *must* be accelerated to light speed (or arbitrarily close) because, in fact, things with mass can't go light speed (which is to say they come into existence slower and can only be accelerated around).

	<TEXT> You are wrong.

You are right that you can get arbitrarily close to the speed of light which means your clock will run ever slower.

However, it is absolutely true that if you ACHIEVE light speed (impossible) and do not merely get ever closer your clock stops.

It is definitional in relativity.

	<TEXT> I understand it just fine.

If we assume a magic rocket that can push you to the speed of light (impossible) time will stop for the people on the ship.  

That said it is impossible for something with mass to got the speed of light so you can get arbitrarily close to it but never reach it.  

To those looking at you they will see your clocks moving slower.  To you your clocks will be running at a normal speed.

If you actually achieved light speed your clock stops.

Indeed physics call allow for things that go faster than light speed (e.g. tachyons) or slower (NOTE: we have never observed things that go faster than "c" but they can fit within current physical models).  But light speed itself is a barrier.  Things that go faster can never go slower and vice versa.

	<TEXT> "c" is the speed of light in a vacuum.

It is measured as 299,792,458 m/s in *all* reference frames (meaning no matter where you are or what you are doing you will measure the speed of light in a vacuum as that speed).

It is a universal speed limit so no...no human can ever reach it.  

Nothing with mass can reach that speed.  

There are a variety of reasons such as time slowing down the closer you get to "c".  When you hit "c" time would stop for you (e.g. if you pushed the button on your magic space ship drive that moved you at "c" you could never, ever, in the history of the whole universe, push the button again to turn it off because time will have stopped for you...the universe will literally cease to exist before you can push the button again to stop your ship).

There are other issues too but that is a show stopper all by itself.

	<TEXT> ["Naked short selling"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naked_short_selling) is selling shares you do not own.  It has a dubious legal status.  It can be done but is dodgy.

Most times short selling is done by borrowing from someone who owns the security.

For example, let's say you own 100 pebbles.  I think pebbles will go down in value.  So I borrow some pebbles from you with a promise to give them back to you a week later.

You agree and charge me some fee for the trouble.

I borrow 10 of your 100 pebbles and immediately sell them on the market.  Let's say for $10 each ($100 total).  I HAVE to give you 10 pebbles back at the end of the week...no matter what!

So, if the pebble lose value I can re-buy the pebbles on the open market for less than I sold them.  Pretend at the end of the week I can buy those pebbles back for $9.00/each.  I can re-buy the 10 pebbles $90. 

I now give you your 10 pebbles back.  They cost me $90 but when I borrowed from you a week earlier I sold them for $100 so I pocket $10 (actually a bit less due to fees and a charge to "borrow" the security).

If the pebbles rise in value I'm screwed.  I still have to buy back 10 shares to return to you but now I buy them at a loss.

	<TEXT> Let's say you think Widget Corp. stock will go down in price.

1)  Borrow the stock from someone who owns stock in "Widget Corp." (naked short selling is selling the stock without owning it which is usually a crime).

2) When you borrow the stock you promise to repay the person the stock you borrowed (not in cash as if you bought it but return the stock) and often some cash for the service.  

3)  When the stock goes down you sell it.  Say you borrowed it when it was $100.  You then sell it at $100.  A short time later, if you guessed right, the stock is worth, say, $90.  You re-buy the shares you borrowed for $90/share and return them to the person you borrowed from.

4)  You pocket the difference between the borrowed price and the re-purchase price minus some fees.

If the price goes up you *still* have to give the stock back which means you buy at a loss and lose money on the transaction.

You can also use Options to give you an "option" to buy or sell stock at a set price.  This can be used to bet either way on a stock market move.  However, it is safer because you have the "option" and not an obligation to sell the stock.  You pay a premium very much akin to an insurance premium for this right.  In this way you can spend a little to cover you from a big move. </TEXT>

Yup although really 2+ million sold is not bad at all by most measures.

Most noticeably is the critical hit Alien: Isolation, which has solid 2.1 million copies to date, but failed to meet Sega expectations.

	<TEXT> AMD has been AWOL with competitive video card releases for awhile now.  [Nvidia has had four releases with no answer from AMD](http://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonevangelho/2015/03/17/with-titan-x-nvidia-has-introduced-4-unanswered-gpus/) and the [r9 280x was pretty much a re-branded 7970.](https://youtu.be/xoH3ly5gkoI?t=507)

People can fanboy all they want about which cards are better but at the end of the day we are all served well when there is real competition between them.  Without it we get crap like this from Nvidia.

Let's hope the upcoming card from AMD is a performance winner and a good value.  As consumers we will all win if it is.

	<TEXT> There are other reasons for the Electoral College.

If the president is elected by direct vote (e.g. just a straight-up 50%+1 vote of the whole voting populace) then the president can ignore wide swaths of the country.  The population is centered in cities so the "fly over" states can largely be ignored.

Or...pander to an ethnic majority or religious majority.

With the electoral college the candidates need to win a lot of smaller races to win.  They cannot ignore minority interests as easily.

We are used to such contests and have no problem with them as a way to do things:

The same logic that governs our electoral system, he saw, also applies to many sports--which Americans do, intuitively, understand. In baseballs World Series, for example, the team that scores the most runs overall is like a candidate who gets the most votes. But to become champion, that team must win the most games. In 1960, during a World Series as nail-bitingly close as that years presidential battle between Kennedy and Nixon, the New York Yankees, with the awesome slugging combination of Mickey Mantle, Roger Maris, and Bill "Moose" Skowron, scored more than twice as many total runs as the Pittsburgh Pirates, 55 to 27. Yet the Yankees lost the series, four games to three. Even Natapoff, who grew up in the shadow of Yankee Stadium, conceded that Pittsburgh deserved to win. "Nobody walked away saying it was unfair," he says. [SOURCE](http://discovermagazine.com/2004/sep/math-against-tyranny)

	<TEXT> Imagine we use pebbles as currency.

I want to buy a widget from you and it costs me ten pebbles.  I dig into my pocket and hand you ten pebbles and you give me the widget.

Electronic transfers are doing basically the same thing.  Taking stuff out of your pocket and giving it to someone else.

Obviously if we used pebbles for money transacting things like buying a house would be difficult.  We'd need trucks to carry the money around.  What is much more efficient is to just move the money around on a ledger.

So, you have all your pebbles at a bank.  So do a lot of other people.  You do not have a private vault with only your pebbles in it.  The bank keeps them all in a big pile and keeps a ledger that records who has what.

When an electronic transfer order comes in the bank records the transaction on their ledger which says you now have less money and the merchant has more money.  Yet not one pebble in the bank vault was moved.  It was all done on paper.  Even if it is different banks they have some money moving one way and some moving the other way.  At the end of the day they settle up and find most of it cancels out (e.g. my bank has to give your bank $5 but then someone else did business the other way and your bank owes my bank $5...at the end of the day they square their ledgers and no money physically moves).

You still need the pebbles in the vault though.  If you just think you can magic up some money without the assets to back it up (i.e. pebbles in this case) then bad things happen.  Ask Zimbabwe who tried it and ended up printing $100 trillion bills (yes, trillion with a "t").  [You can buy them for about US$40](http://banknoteworld.com/shop/Zimbabwe-100-Trillion-Dollars-2008-P-91-Uncirculated-1-Piece.html) but they are worthless as a currency.  Just a novelty item now.

	<TEXT> The issue is that consoles are harming the PC gaming market.

Developers, very reasonably and understandably, develop to the lowest common denominator.  It is very expensive to make different versions for different systems.  

I am on the fence with this one.

On the one hand CDPR seemed to go above and beyond to make what looks to be a high water mark in open world CRPG.  Doing that took a lot of time, people and money to produce.  To make a profit and stay in business they need to widen the audience and pull in consoles too.  Unfortunately this means graphics get left behind.

On the flip side it fucking sucks that the graphics on this highly anticipated game has been kneecapped.  We all know it could have been fucking awesome.  Stellar even.  Truly a triumph and an unparalleled high water mark.  Instead we get insipid graphics (honestly I am wondering if Witcher 2 actually has better graphics...I intend to check).

Personally I think if they had delivered a PC-only tour de force they'd have had people ditching their consoles and upgrading their PCs.  They should have had Intel and Nvidia subsidize them to give people a reason to buy new hardware.

tl;dr Consoles are killing PC gaming because they make the whole industry cater to the lowest performing setup.

	<TEXT> You cannot send money you do not have because an electronic transfer is a deduction from one account and a deposit at another account.

So, you swipe your credit card at a store and the store's computer contacts your credit card provider and asks it if there is enough money in the account to cover the purchase.  If yes the sale continues and the amount is deducted from your account and added to the merchant's account.

If there is no money to be had the transaction is canceled.

So too with countries.  If Greece says, "Here is 500 billion," the bank receiving the money needs to find the account where that money is stored and deduct it.  If it is not there then it does not happen.

One possibility is you get [motion sickness playing video games](http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/dec/19/video-games-makes-me-sick).  It is fairly common and can present itself as a headache and/or nausea.  

To combat this many PC games have a field of view (FOV) setting that you can adjust which may alleviate the problem.  For console players they are (generally) further from the TV while playing so do not suffer from this as much.  If it is happening while playing a console game try sitting further away from the TV.

Unfortunately some developers do not put a FOV control in their game for various reasons.  For me, if there is no FOV control I will not buy the game because playing makes me physically ill. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's more than just cost.  AMD cards are competitive but Nvidia is winning the marketing war.  You can see many in this thread who just *know* that Nvidia = faster (even though it is not really true or only just barely true and hardly worth nothing the difference).

While that is in error some things push that perception.  One of which is what I posted above.  Eight months with no answer to your competitor makes it seem you are a has-been in the tech industry. 

Further, AMD's substantially higher power requirements (and attendant higher heat generation) is a drawback and again makes them seem less efficient and thus old tech.

As I said I have used AMD cards for the last 7 or so years.  I am not an Nvidia fanboy.  But I was in the zone for a new card and AMD had nothing I wanted anymore.  That's just me though.

To be clear I really, really hope AMD succeeds with this new card.  Strong competition is good for us.  Unfortunately, and I have no idea why, AMD has lost a few steps on their competitors (Intel and Nvidia).  There was once a day when they had those guys running scared.  Now AMD is perceived as the bargain bin level of computing.

They really need to up their game.  Not easy, their competition is doing their level best to bury them and are close to succeeding.  They'll be willing to lose money in the short term if it means they can end the competition.

EDIT:  As an aside their "points program" where you earn points to get discounts on AMD stuff is pathetic.  It actually helped drive me away from AMD because it was so much bullshit.  You had to play a gazillion hours of different games to earn enough points to do much and the discounts were unbelievably pathetic for all that.

	<TEXT>  Why did AMD think they could get away with a single fan on the reference design? 

[Nvidia's reference design is a single fan.](http://www.overclockers.co.uk/pimg/GX-255-EA_97524_350.jpg)

I have two 980s with the single fan reference design and while the card gets a bit toasty it is well within operating parameters and very quiet.

The advantage to these reference designs is they exhaust the hot air outside the case.  Most other cooling designs blow the hot air all around the inside of the case.  This diminishes cooling effectiveness since the fans are warming the air they use to cool the card.

If you have good case fans pushing all that out fine but more fans also equals more noise.

It is linked in the article:

With todays more official reveal of the Titan X and its massive 12GB framebuffer, Nvidia has now introduced four unanswered graphics cards into the market since AMDs Radeon 285 in August 2014, and these GPUs have targeted a broad consumer demographic, ranging from the $200 GTX 960 all the way up to the $999 Titan X.

Thats 8 months without a new desktop GPU product from AMD, nearly an eternity in the tech world. Thats 8 months Nvidia has had to continue eroding AMDs market share. 8 months to steal away new fans, from the mainstream PC gamer all the way up to the ultra-enthusiast.  [SOURCE](http://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonevangelho/2015/03/17/with-titan-x-nvidia-has-introduced-4-unanswered-gpus/)

FWIW I was using AMD cards the last several years (at least three card buying cycles for me) and I recently bought an Nvidia card in part because of the above.  AMD had me.  AMD lost me and won't get me back for at least three years when I next consider an upgrade.

EVERY time they were of no help whatsoever and left me out in the cold.  It did not matter that I am a very good and long time customer.  It did not matter that I rarely contact them (so not bugging them for every little thing).

EVERY TIME they were slow to respond and utterly unsympathetic.  They had my money, I could go fuck myself.  Why?  Because fuck you, that's why.  They know there was nothing I could do about it.  They had me over a barrel and were more than content to leave me there.

GOG will not out compete Steam today or tomorrow but in a few years who knows?  Steam when it started kinda sucked and look where it is today.

I sincerely hope GOG makes a good go of this and Steam finds its lack of consumer support is its Achilles' Heel.

I got my new 980 from Newegg just before the new promotion started and they were super cool about it.  Sent me the code.

Note there is no guarantee they will give you the code.  They may tell you to go pound sand but it is always worth a try.

(As it happens I am about to upgrade my whole PC anyway and they just guaranteed themselves all my purchases...awesome customer service is all too rare these days.)

Probably the worst Bond and in only one film ([On Her Majesty's Secret Service](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_Her_Majesty%27s_Secret_Service_%28film%29)).

In the film something bad happens to him (avoiding spoilers).  This could easily be used as a reason for him breaking bad.

I think he'd actually have been an ok bad guy.

	<TEXT> There are a number of theories but perhaps the most prevalent one is the ["gay uncle" theory](http://www.livescience.com/6106-gay-uncles-pass-genes.html).

In short, gay uncles provide a net benefit to the survival of the extended family (since they do not have kids of their own they expend energy and aid in the survival of the extended family). 

There is also a [theory that female relatives of gay men are more fecund](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2158795/Gay-gene-survives-generations-female-relatives-homosexual-men-babies.html) (have more babies).  

As it happens the population does not need many males.  It needs females so some men "dropping out" of the gene pool is not a bad natural selection thing if his sisters are better able to make babies.

	<TEXT>  From my point of view, it largely seems to stem from the fact he is hiding behind the first amendment to promote fringe or even quack medical and health products.

Well, while it is true he invoked his free speech rights under the First Amendment as his excuse to continue saying what he is saying it should be noted that his rights under the First Amendment were never in peril.

The First Amendment only protects you from the government silencing you.  It is entirely within the rights of Columbia University to revoke his status there and for other people to point out he is a snake oil salesman.  Dr. Oz can continue to stand in his front yard saying anything he likes but the University he works for is not required to grant him a stage or their imprimatur.

More broadly speaking to the OP the outrage towards Dr. Oz is not new at all.  There has long been anger and outrage at his peddling "magic pills".  It is only lately that the community of doctors is turning against him.  Generally they are loathe to go after one of their own (because someday they may be the one people go after and they do not want that).  But Dr. Oz has been so consistently bad for so long they could no longer remain silent and have called for his ouster from Columbia.

In some ways it is too bad this is happening.  By all accounts he is a personable guy and an exceptional heart surgeon.  It is his peddling snake oil cures that has people angry *particularly* because he is a doctor and definitely knows better.

*Primum non nocere* is a Latin phrase that means "first, do no harm" and is is one of the principal precepts of bioethics.  He is violating that.

	<TEXT> I have issue with it.  Not because I do not think mod makers should necessarily work for free but considering the number of mods I like to use and try and change over time the mods can very, very quickly outstrip the cost of the game itself.  I had 30 mods on Skyrim and tried many more over the years.

Smacks of microtransaction hell.

Frankly there did not seem to be a problem with mods as they were.  There was no hue and cry for mod makers to get paid.  Why this should change except to line the pockets of devs and Valve even more is beyond me.

If they REALLY wanted mods makers to be able to make money they could setup a donation system and clear and legal roadblocks for the mod makers to collect. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> All I can do is vote with my wallet.

I just bought Witcher 3 elsewhere because of this.  I will continue to find alternate venues to buy my games.

I may not always be able to and then I will buy from Steam but I can guarantee Steam will lose more from the games I won't buy from them than the mods I will buy from them.

FWIW I have been a customer of Steam for a long time and barring one or two cases (unless it was an exclusive tied to something like Origin) bought all my games through them.  I am not their #1 customer or probably even their #10,000 customer but I have spent a considerable sum with them over the years.

I will make it a point to try and spend my money elsewhere.  Amazon, GOG, Green Man Gaming are vendors that leap to mind and, much as I hate to say it, I might have to look to Origin.

If Origin/EA has a clue they'd do well to take advantage of it.  Origin already has a better return policy.  Combine that with Steam's utter lack of customer support and its new mod policy and competitors might have an opening.  

One can only hope.

If it is something you want and just have to buy through Steam for some reason then fine.  But even so if you buy most games elsewhere they'll feel the pinch and lose more than they make on Mod sales.

	<TEXT> The problem is not buying mods does not hurt Valve in any way whatsoever.

Prior to this they made no money on mods.

They then added a bit of code to their billing system and now they can.

If you do not buy any mods they are no worse off than they were before.  It does not hurt them in the slightest.

I completely get your anger and I share it.

I just do not think Valve gives a fuck and this is the first time I have seen them turn to purely anti-consumer, money grubbing tactics ala the EA model.  If the goal is to reward mod designers the mod designers can setup a Patreon account or a dozen other means to ask the community for support.  I do not see how them getting a mere 25% will be better for them than random donations.

If Valve wants to make more money they should get Half-Life 3 out.  Pretty sure that would net them a few $$$.

	<TEXT> But a train ride from NYC to Chicago is just a waste of time.

Would it?

The distance is 790 miles.  

A plane will make the trip in 2 hours and 10 minutes (130 minutes).

On paper the train (if we assume 300 MPH average) would take 2.6 hours (let's go with three hours for a round number).

So, the high speed train would take 50 minutes longer. 

BUT:

- The train goes from city center to city center.  No need for commute.  I live in Chicago and can tell you the Chicago end will be 30-45 minutes from airport to city center.  Add on how long it takes to get to LaGuardia, JFK or Newark in New York). 

- You need to get to the airport particularly early to clear security.  Add on anywhere from 5-30 minutes for that (you never know...sometimes fast, sometimes slow but you have to allow for slow).

- The train is more comfortable.  Bigger seats.  No air pressure differentials.  Concession cars/bar cars.

I'd think Chicago to New York would be competitive.  At a guess I think any trip under 1000 miles might be well worth considering a train for instead of a plane (all things considered).

	<TEXT> Well, yes and no.

Certainly jet planes fly faster.  But not by as much as you might think.  Average jetliner cruise speeds are around 550 MPH.  200 MPH faster than the train is a lot but then the plane spends a good deal of time slower at takeoff and especially landing.  I am not sure what the average speed is for a whole flight (terminal to terminal) but I bet it is a lot less than 550 MPH.  The train would be too since it would not maintain 366 MPH the whole way but willing to bet it is less of a decrease than the plane.

Add in the time you need to dork around in an airport (getting there 90 minutes before your flight to clear security and what not) and you can start to see there is a sizeable window where high speed trains would make sense and be competitively fast getting from Point-A to Point-B.  Even better trains can go from city center to city center.  Quite unlike the commute to the periphery of a city to get to an airport.

Cross country in the US (NY - LA) would be too slow but lots of shorter jaunts would make sense and further than you might think.

Also consider that trains are almost always more comfortable.  Bigger seats, bar cars, cell phone service, easier to walk around  and so on make them a LOT more attractive than the cattle car airline seating and amenities.

TL;DR:  Bottom line when you consider ALL travel time associated with using a plane or train (commute to the airport/station, time to check in, etc.) it is easy to see how high speed trains could be quite competitive with a plane in terms of time.  Add in comfort and the train really pulls ahead in all but very long travel distances.

She will navigate this easily enough by not actually being a part of it.  She is currently out of the government so she will wring her hands and say there is nothing she can do.  She may well mouth some platitudes for the liberal base but she will not do a thing to oppose it.

Nothing short of her saying explicitly and clearly that she will do her level best, if she becomes president, to see the US not be a party to the TPP or leave it if we already are will amount to anything.

I am guessing you have never had a dog.

I have and there have been numerous times where I came home with zero clue anything was wrong.  Instead of my dog greeting me as usual she'd be reluctant and frankly looking guilty as hell.  There was no prompt from me that would scare her into submission.  I was walking in the door as normal.  It was then I knew to go looking for the trouble she caused.

Dogs are intelligent creatures.  They share the same emotions we do.  Even if you have never had a dog you can instantly recognize their emotional state be it happy or scared or angry or whatever.  Why?  Because we have those emotions in common.

There is no reason to think guilt over having done something bad is on the list.  Dogs have long memories and they can discern when they have done something "bad".  Like a little kid they fret over it.

	<TEXT>  Strictly speaking, dogs are rarely associated with being able to tell right from wrong, and what is correct and what is not. To them, mauling another animal may just be something that is natural and all part of the chain of life.

Dogs absolutely do have a sense of right and wrong.  There are [countless examples you can see on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=guilty+dog) of dogs looking guilty.  They look guilty because they know they broke the rules.

One reason dogs work so well as pets for humans is dogs are innately social animals.  Even in the wild there are dos and don'ts among the pack that are enforced by the social structure.

Dogs are not a walking, furry machine of random.  They abide by and adhere to a set of rules just as humans do.

It is not clear at all that this is the case.

OK, so I passively agreed to being recorded by staying on the line after being informed that the call may be recorded. The representative agrees to be recorded as per their job with the call center they work with. Then what is the problem? Theyre recording so I can record.

Youre going to hate me on this but no, you can not. These are two separate instances of the same thing.

 Thing 1 (T1): The location you are calling has consent from you and the person you are talking with to record the call.

 Thing 2 (T2): Recording a call between you and an entity that you agreed to record your call  but did not agree to you recording them.

These are two different things. The center had consent to record from both parties. Ryan did not have that consent nor, in the recordings placed online, did he specifically ask or tell the representative he was recording.

Why Wall Street Loves Hillary - William D. Cohan

While the finance industry does genuinely hate Warren, the big bankers love Clinton, and by and large they badly want her to be president. Many of the rich and powerful in the financial industryamong them, Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein, Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman, Tom Nides, a powerful vice chairman at Morgan Stanley, and the heads of JPMorganChase and Bank of Americaconsider Clinton a pragmatic problem-solver not prone to populist rhetoric. To them, shes someone who gets the idea that we all benefit if Wall Street and American business thrive. What about her forays into fiery rhetoric? They dismiss it quickly as political maneuvers.

	<TEXT> Wiki has a pretty good explanation:

The concept of purchasing power parity allows one to estimate what the exchange rate between two currencies would have to be in order for the exchange to be at par with the purchasing power of the two countries' currencies. Using that PPP rate for hypothetical currency conversions, a given amount of one currency thus has the same purchasing power whether used directly to purchase a market basket of goods or used to convert at the PPP rate to the other currency and then purchase the market basket using that currency. Observed deviations of the exchange rate from purchasing power parity are measured by deviations of the real exchange rate from its PPP value of 1.
PPP exchange rates help to minimize misleading international comparisons that can arise with the use of market exchange rates. 

For example, suppose that two countries produce the same physical amounts of goods as each other in each of two different years. Since market exchange rates fluctuate substantially, when the GDP of one country measured in its own currency is converted to the other country's currency using market exchange rates, one country might be inferred to have higher real GDP than the other country in one year but lower in the other; both of these inferences would fail to reflect the reality of their relative levels of production. But if one country's GDP is converted into the other country's currency using PPP exchange rates instead of observed market exchange rates, the false inference will not occur.

- UTC time is Coordinated Universal Time which is basically equivalent to Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) which is a time zone.  All times in the world (via the time zones) are + or - from GMT so sort of making GMT the zero point.  Note that UTC is NOT a time zone (that is the main difference from GMT) and is always read on a 24-hour clock.  So for instance GMT may experience daylight savings adjustment while UTC will not.

- Unix time (also known as POSIX time or Epoch time) is a system for describing instants in time, defined as the number of seconds that have elapsed since 00:00:00 Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), Thursday, 1 January 1970,[1][note 1] not counting leap seconds.[1][2][note 2] It is used widely in Unix-like and many other operating systems and file formats. Due to its handling of leap seconds, it is neither a linear representation of time nor a true representation of UTC. [SOURCE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time)

	<TEXT> There is no evidence that being gay and getting laid decreases porn consumption.  Indeed one could just as easily assume it increases since gay men are quite likely to watch porn together.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Technically the people who climb Mt. Everest have already paid (substantially) for garbage collection.

There are some fixed costs that every climber has to pay, regardless of how they climb or who they climb with. Climbing permits, issued by the Nepalese government, cost $70,000 for a party of seven, or $25,000 for an individual climber. Every group pays camp fees, like a garbage and waste deposit, and pays a local government liaison to stay in camp with them.

	<TEXT>  I don't get it. Why are same sex couples so keen on using the power of the state to jail people who don't want to preform their marriages, bake their cakes, etc.?

What if you hire a photographer for your wedding, they show up and see it is a gay wedding and leave?

Same with the caterer or band or whatever.

Do you think people need to identify as gay any time they want to do business with someone?  Would you say in the 50's it'd be ok if you had to identify as black before you could do business with someone?

	<TEXT> Occasionally I see pics around here that say, "This is my grandma in 1965!"

I wonder if in 2065 someone will post this with, "This is my grandma in 2015!"

I sure hope so...
