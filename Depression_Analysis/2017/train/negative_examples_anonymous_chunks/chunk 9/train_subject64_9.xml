Therefore, every GI, sailor, airman and marine who participated in the unjust wars against Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Yemen, Somalia, et al, did so by choice.   They committed war crimes to further the political, religious and economic interests of a select group of elites whose only goal is to promote U.S. hegemony and empire.  They do not deserve admiration or thanks. </TEXT>
