	<TEXT> Our primary finding provides initial longitudinal evidence that cannabis use might elevate the risk of lung cancer. In light of the widespread use of marijuana, especially among adolescents and young adults, our study provides important data for informing the risk-benefit calculus of marijuana smoking in medical, public-health, and drug-policy settings.

  
-[Source](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23846283)
  

  There were 79 cases of lung cancer and 324 controls. The risk of lung cancer increased 8% (95% CI 2% to 15%) for each joint-year of cannabis smoking, after adjustment for confounding variables including cigarette smoking, and 7% (95% CI 5% to 9%) for each pack-year of cigarette smoking, after adjustment for confounding variables including cannabis smoking. The highest tertile of cannabis use was associated with an increased risk of lung cancer RR=5.7 (95% CI 1.5 to 21.6), after adjustment for confounding variables including cigarette smoking.

	<TEXT> but you already know thats not true by the number of rats used. why do you misinform people so much while claiming to be a champion of science?
  
It was neither a chronic toxicity study due to the duration and number of rats that where used. His study differed more from a chronic toxicity study then it did for a carcinogencity study. 
  
again, you already know he modelled the test after monsantos. 
  
No he didn't, duration was way too long and sample size was way to small to be able to gain any meaningful data. Monsanto looked at sub chronic toxicity and Seralini just through shit at the wall and hoped something stuck. 
  
if he use wistar rats like many other carcinogenity studies amd presented tumors as evidence you might
  
Wistar and SD rats are both commonly used for testing either toxicity or carcinogencity. 
  
And he did in fact present his findings on tumor prevalence as evidence against both glyphosate and GMO feed [despite not running any statistical analysis](http://i.imgur.com/F3MtjXB.png), maybe you should actually read the paper?
  
Suffering inducing euthanasia and deaths corresponded mostly
in females to the development of large mammary tumors. These
appeared to be clearly related to the various treatments when
compared to the control groups. These tumors are generally known
to be mostly estrogen-dependent (Harvell et al., 2000). We observed
a strikingly marked induction of mammary tumors by R
alone, a major formulated pesticide, even at the very lowest dose

Interestingly, in the groups of animals fed with the NK603 without
R application, similar effects with respect to enhanced tumor
incidence and mortality rates were observed.

	<TEXT> Tumor prevalence was a major finding of his study and any toxicologist worth his shit would be aware of the rate of spontaneous tumors in SD rats when taken out to 18+ months. Again, there is little reason anyone would run a rat study with SD rats out to 2 years unless you were looking for carcinogencity. Chronic toxicity is usually 1 year at 20 rats per sex per group (OECD 452). Seralini didn't not follow protocol for any international recognized toxicity study, his protocol and how he reported his findings most matched a carcinogencity trial. 
  
The only person misinformed is you and your pestering that Seralini's study actually means anything in terms of GMO safety. There is a reason why the study was retracted and many health and safety boards published their own independent reviews citing faults and errors in it.

[Here is the original 2012 research paper by Seralini](http://www.gmoseralini.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/GES-final-study-19.9.121.pdf)



[Here is Elsevier retracting the study from the Journal of Food and Chemical Toxicology.](http://www.elsevier.com/about/press-releases/research-and-journals/elsevier-announces-article-retraction-from-journal-food-and-chemical-toxicology) 
  
The retraction was over the fact that do to the small sample size of 10 rats per sex per group and 2 year duration of the study it was physically unable to draw meaning conclusion on either general toxicology or carcinogenicity. 
  
[The common protocol for sub chronic toxicity dictates 10 rats per sex per group for 13 weeks.](http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/environment/test-no-408-repeated-dose-90-day-oral-toxicity-study-in-rodents_9789264070707-en)
  
[The common protocol for chronic toxicity dictates 20 rats per sex per group and is ran for one year.](http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/environment/test-no-452-chronic-toxicity-studies_9789264071209-en)
  
[The common protocol for carcinogenicity is 50+ rats per sex per group for 18-24 months.](http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/environment/test-no-451-carcinogenicity-studies_9789264071186-en)
 

[Here is a study that modeled the effect on decreasing sample size of a carcinogenicity study](http://www.ams.sunysb.edu/~hahn/psfile/papyang.pdf)
  
[Relevant section showing the decrease in power from 50 rats per group down to 30.](http://i.imgur.com/MEhC8C8.png) This is in contrast to the 10 rats per group that Seralini decided to use for his study.


Seralini ran a bastardization between a sub chronic toxicity study and a carcinogenicity study, with using only 10 rats per sex per group and running it for 2 years.  
  
Also Seralini did not run any statistical analysis on mortality or tumor prevalence. His data, due to sample size and short duration was inadequate to determine if any of his observed effects were statitically significant. 
  
[Here is a response to letters to the editors by Editor-in-Chief Wallace Hayes](http://www.elsevier.com/about/press-releases/research-and-journals/food-and-chemical-toxicology-editor-in-chief,-a.-wallace-hayes,-publishes-response-to-letters-to-the-editors)
  

The retraction was in line with COPE guidelines.  
  
  
[The COPE guidelines were consulted when making this decision. According to the COPE guidelines, Journal editors should consider retracting a publication if they have clear evidence that the findings are unreliable, either as a result of misconduct (e.g. data fabrication) or honest error (e.g. miscalculation or experimental error).(COPE, 2009). The retraction statement could have been clearer, and should have referred to the relevant COPE guidelines. The data are inconclusive, therefore the claim (ie, conclusion) that Roundup Ready maize NK603 and/or the Roundup herbicide have a link to cancer is unreliable. Dr. Sralini deserves the benefit of the doubt that this unreliable conclusion was reached in honest error.)](http://www.elsevier.com/about/press-releases/research-and-journals/food-and-chemical-toxicology-editor-in-chief,-a.-wallace-hayes,-publishes-response-to-letters-to-the-editors#sthash.2el1IrEj.dpuf)
  
Here are some responses to the original 2012 Seralini study, finding short comings in both design and statistical methods used.  
  
http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278691512007843

http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278691512007892
  
[Here is the original EFSA report that highlighted short comings and error in the 2012 Seralini study.](http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/pub/2986.htm)   
  
  
EFSA finds that the study as reported by Sralini et al. is of insufficient scientific quality for safety assessments. EFSA concludes that the currently available evidence does not impact on the ongoing re-evaluation of glyphosate and does not call for the reopening of the safety evaluations of maize NK603 and its related stacks.
 
  
[Here is Health Canada's response.](http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fn-an/gmf-agm/seralini-eng.php)  
  
  
Based on Health Canada and CFIAs review of this information [the Seralini study], the authors conclusions concerning the long term safety of NK603 corn and glyphosate are not supported
  
[Food Standards Australia/New Zealand](http://www.foodstandards.gov.au/consumer/gmfood/seralini/pages/default.aspx)  
  

  
On the basis of the many scientific deficiencies identified in the study, FSANZ does not accept the conclusions made by the authors [Seralini et al] and has therefore found no justification to reconsider the safety of NK603 corn

[High Council of Biotechnolgies conclusion.](http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/doc/2986ax1.pdf)
  

  Consequently, the HCB Scientific Committee considers that the paper offers no information supporting the existence of a health risk associated with consumption of maize NK603, whether or not treated with a Roundup herbicide formulation. 

[ANSES Opinion](http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/doc/2986ax1.pdf)

**Conclusion on study Results**
  
[The significant results obtained before correction are not biologically coherent overall. However, biological data on the results would be needed to draw a definitive conclusion. At this point in time, in light of the information provided in the publication, the ECEAGs experts consider that the authors interpretations are not sufficiently corroborated by the study data. 
Moreover, during the hearing, the studys authors admitted that this study was not conclusive by itself and that, though subject to improvement, it had the merit of opening up an interesting line of research. 
From ANSES opinion from their evaluation of the Seralini study on pathologies.](http://i.imgur.com/W0OJGIg.png)
  
[Here is the relevant chart.](http://i.imgur.com/BxD7sAb.png)  


[Monsanto's response to the study](http://www.monsanto.com/products/Documents/ProductSafety/seralini-sept-2012-monsanto-comments.pdf)  
  
  

[Here is a Nature article on the controversy.](http://www.nature.com/news/hyped-gm-maize-study-faces-growing-scrutiny-1.11566)
  
Also this was not the first long term GMO feeding study.  
  
[Sakamoto's 104 week feeding study was, it looked at GMO soybeans and failed to find harm interms of carcinogenicity in Wisker rats.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18787312)
  
[Also here is some info on who funded CRIIGEN to do this study.](http://gmopundit.blogspot.com/2012/09/auchan-and-carrefour-financed-criigen.html)



 
The study was recently republished in a relatively new journal with minor changes to wording and can be found [here.](http://www.enveurope.com/content/26/1/14)
  
[Here is the response by several scientist of the republishing of this study.](http://www.geneticliteracyproject.org/2014/06/24/scientists-react-to-republished-seralini-maize-rat-study/)

[Here is a Nature article on the republication of the Seralini et al study.](http://www.nature.com/news/paper-claiming-gm-link-with-tumours-re-published-1.15463)
  
I also like this quote I found by Tom Sanders who is a professor of nutrition and dietetics at King's College London.
  

Republishing data that was faulty in the first place in study design and analysis does not provide redemption. Furthermore, it is now possible to publish almost anything in open access journals 
  
[Also the republication was not peer reviewed.](http://retractionwatch.com/2014/06/26/republished-seralini-gmo-rat-study-was-not-peer-reviewed-says-editor/)
  
Here is a quote of Seralini admitting that the goal of the study was to ban GMOs.
  
["What we want to achieve with this study is a moratorium"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njd0RugGjAg amp;t=10m45s)
  
**TLDR:** Seralini's 2012 study is full of elementary mistakes and follows an inadequate protocol that fails to support the conclusions he makes. </TEXT>

much like monsantos safety study then eh. where in seralinis paper does it say they are testing for carcinogenity?
  
Again, the major presented findings of Seralini's research were the tumors and the only reason why you would run a 2 year study on SD rats would be to test for carcinogencity.  </TEXT>

There was no evidence of a carcinogenic effect related toglyphosatetreatment. The lack of a plausible mechanism, along with published epidemiology studies, which fail to demonstrate clear, statistically significant, unbiased and non-confounded associations betweenglyphosateand cancer of any single etiology, and a compelling weight of evidence, support the conclusion thatglyphosatedoes not present concern with respect to carcinogenic potential in humans.

Note that there was a weak but slight association with multiple myeloma that the authors suggest that further follow up is required. Also this was among applicators who inherently are exposed to significantly higher amounts of glyphosate than end product consumers.

  
Also a re-analysis of the AHS data failed to show the same link between glyphosate and multiple meyloma.

[Epidemiologic studies of glyphosate and cancer: A review](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0273230012000943)
  
To examine potential cancer risks in humans, we reviewed the epidemiologic literature to evaluate whether exposure to glyphosate is associated causally with cancer risk in humans. We also reviewed relevant methodological and biomonitoring studies of glyphosate. Seven cohort studies and fourteen case-control studies examined the association between glyphosate and one or more cancer outcomes. Our review found no consistent pattern of positive associations indicating a causal relationship between total cancer (in adults or children) or any site-specific cancer and exposure to glyphosate.

	<TEXT> Our primary finding provides initial longitudinal evidence that cannabis use might elevate the risk of lung cancer. In light of the widespread use of marijuana, especially among adolescents and young adults, our study provides important data for informing the risk-benefit calculus of marijuana smoking in medical, public-health, and drug-policy settings.

  
-[Source](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23846283)
  

  There were 79 cases of lung cancer and 324 controls. The risk of lung cancer increased 8% (95% CI 2% to 15%) for each joint-year of cannabis smoking, after adjustment for confounding variables including cigarette smoking, and 7% (95% CI 5% to 9%) for each pack-year of cigarette smoking, after adjustment for confounding variables including cannabis smoking. The highest tertile of cannabis use was associated with an increased risk of lung cancer RR=5.7 (95% CI 1.5 to 21.6), after adjustment for confounding variables including cigarette smoking.
