	<TEXT> This is the second time a woman has boasted about the violence they've perpetrated against Cole, the previous case being his ex-wife who put the remarks about her domestic violence in her autobiography and therefore profited from them.

Neither woman has been subject to the slightest attention from police, despite them both openly confessing to serious violence in writing.

One particular interesting part of the article:

"Carla added: "No-one tried to stop me hitting him  I think that is because of Ashleys bad karma.

I did it for my sister. Ashley has caused her a lot of issues."

	<TEXT> The claims in the article are BS. CAFE simply named a number of groups who it hoped to work with. Secondly, there a hundreds and hundreds of studies showing that 50% of dv victims are men so again their claim is true.

Finally, your typical feminist website/pamphlet will contain at least one completely debunked factoid concerning domestic violence (usually several), so if people really have a major problem with misleading claims about dv then they need to start targeting serial offenders, i.e. vast numbers of feminists and feminist organisations (not to mention government departments) </TEXT>

	<TEXT>   If you're not welcome at an event, do us all a favour and do not show up.

CAFE's original ban (in 2014) went against ever single Pride rule imaginable and was therefore invalid. As for this year, there still hasn't been an actual reason given other than "complaints", the complaint clearly haven't been investigated, nor deemed as valid reasons for barring Pride.

**Pride are now in a situation where anyone can make any complaint about any group and as long as there are a dozen of such complaints then that group can be banned forever!** It doesn't matter how ridiculous or false the complaints happen to be, the organisation just gets banned simply becasue of a handful of ridiculous or politically motivated complaints. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's important to emphasise that the case was dismissed on procedural grounds, not becasue of any facts surrounding the case. Furthermore, in the example you cite those involved have apologised and accepted that they did terrible things, Solo has failed to apologise for her conduct and actually attempts to play the victim!

I agree she's innocent until she's found guilty, though I'm also certain that no male in her position would be representing the US team and we really should be treating all athlete equally regardless of gender.

Well her 9 to 5 job is perhaps playing for her club side. Here's she's being giving the privilege of representing her country on a world stage, something that actually distinguishes and elevates this above all the other cases it is being compared with.

	<TEXT>   if the first thing in their manifesto wasn't about restricting women's access to abortions

The format of the manifesto is chronological - i.e. it deals with foetuses, then babies, then children and then adults. Also, while I'm not all that enthusiastic about the inclusion of the abortion proposals, it's incredible how people try to twist it to pretend it's extreme. In reality, according to this link, http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/6235557.stm the party is only proposing the exact same time limit as in place in **Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Poland, Slovakia**. It's the current UK limit of 24 weeks which is the extreme and out of touch policy relative to other developed nations. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  That's because it's mother's groups and child protection groups making progress, not us.

True, though I haven't seen much involvement from mother's groups in this case, it's the intactivists who've been at the forefront of this. their case is certainly made a hell of a lot easier with the mother being pitted against the father in this instance but whatever the case this is still a major victory for us right now. I certainly haven't ever heard of a case of a hospital and doctor wanting to mutilate a boy and then backing out at the last minute entirely thanks to a campaign to save him from their knife. And if we make it unacceptable for the hospital to mutilate Chase against his will then the natural extension of this process is to make it unacceptable for hospitals  to mutilate any kids just for the hell of it.
