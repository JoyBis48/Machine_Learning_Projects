	<TEXT> There's a lot of books I feel that way about too. I think this is especially true of most classics.

Yeah, don't worry about being a little off my question. I'm not one of those hardcore redditors who scream when someone strays from the question or topic's content. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Just finished reading The Goldfinch. I couldn't stand it when it started out (this line sent me over the edge, "someone could have mistaken her for being Icelandic").

However as I got into it, it turned out to be a really good book.

What was your favorite turnaround? </TEXT>
