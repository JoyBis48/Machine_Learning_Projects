	<TEXT> While this is factually accurate, it is untrue in it's own terms. All foetuses do *not* start out as female before some make a transition to male in utero. **This is a common misconception.** In actual fact all foetuses are naturally hermaphroditic in the womb, before developing male or female characteristics relatively late in pregnancy. Both sexes have characteristics of the other inherited from this early developmental stage; men have nipples, woman have a clitoris (this is an undeveloped penis, and can be stimulated to develop in adult females with the use of steroids) and so on. The proposition that all foetuses start as female is, though widely believed, absurd when you stop to think about it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Before taking drugs, attempt exercise. Seriously. Chemotherapy is often referred to as a sticky-plaster effect, in other words it covers up the problem rather than makes you deal with it. Please, before you start them, join a gym or buy some running shoes, invest in some gym instruction if you can, the internet is full of workout recommendations. After a month or two you will be happier, healthier and genuinely feel better about yourself. About this time last year I was suicidally depressed but refused to take the drugs for personal reasons. Instead I started working out. Now I am about 14kg lighter, feel far more attractive than I ever have before and am able to feel good about myself again at last. I know starting something like this is tough, but if you are in a place where you are considering anti-depressants, any new move is going to be tough. I implore you to try it though, instead of doping yourself out release your aggression and your frustration on a heavy bag or a treadmill or a weight bar. I guarantee that if you persevere, endure and push yourself you will feel a great deal better about yourself. Be strong and stay strong, friend. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Okay, here is a summation of the Healthcare issue, for what it's worth:

The Republican party are fighting tooth and nail against free-to-all healthcare, hence why the two parties have reached an impasse that is causing the shutdown. There is a great deal of smoke and mirrors surrounding this issue, but what this boils down to, in plain english, is a lot of very powerful people will lose a lot of money if healthcare becomes more reasonably available. The consumer (you) do not stand to lose anything, small businesses will not lose out on anything, however large pharmaceutical companies will lose a colossal amount of revenue.

A note on tax: Universal healthcare may not necessarily mean a tax increase for the average citizen. Setting up a National Healthcare Service may well be expensive to begin with, however it is worth remembering that 57c out of every one of your tax dollars currently goes towards the military. Think about that. Maybe you could build one less battleship and give the American people free healthcare. Besides, even if there is a tax increase, you will still be paying a degree of magnitude less overall per medical complaint, and "free healthcare to all" sounds so much nicer that "I will heal you for money". Every other *civilized* country has some for of universal healthcare, or at the very least doesn't take advantage of human frailty or abandon the elderly. America, you are being left behind.

**EDIT:** Gentleman and ladies, I know that, literally speaking, there is no free-to-all healthcare under ACA. There is also a slight spelling mistake in this comment, you are being pedantic! Big picture time people, stop splitting hairs </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Looking at the situation logically, I feel it would be a fair estimation to say that free-to-all healthcare would not damage small business but would significantly damage *big* businesses, i.e the hugely powerful drug companies who pay exorbitant amounts of money to politicians to keep the current status quo in place. Free healthcare means a lot of very powerful people will lose a lot of money. There may be plenty of smoke and long words thrown about, but as far as this observer can detect, that is what it boils down to, in plain english. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Here's a short poem I wrote and posted on /r/shortscarystories:

 -

The shortcut through the Corn field

tempts you as you're walking home

the clouds above keep the moon concealed

as you enter the swaying corn, alone.

 -

The corn grows tall and thick, my friend,

the path you chose is muddy.

It grows in rows without scope or end

and in the dark, you hurry.

 -

You don't see the standing forms

as you pass them on your way,

they stand still amongst the swaying corn

which hides their pallor, and decay.

 -

Hundreds gather in this field tonight

though you see none at all,

yet still you look around in fright

but the corn grows too thick, too tall.

 -

You tell yourself as you continue through

"it's merely the rustling of the leaves,"

but they see you, and they hear you,

and they might not let you leave.

 -

	<TEXT> **A**. The Jews were not kept as the slaves to the people of Egypt. No contemporary Egyptian, Roman or any other evidence or account, other than the Torah, which has obvious inference issues. There was no Passover (the slaying of every Egyptian firstborn would surely be recorded as a major event by the Egyptians don't you think? Also, what a kind and loving act of God to kill the children of the oppressors, and not the oppressors themselves),  the Jews did not build the pyramids, they were not eventually set free. We know this because of historical evidence.

**B**. The question of the jewish claim to the holyland is obviously a hugely scrutinised issue today. It has been extensively studied by many archeologists (I can look up names for you but frankly a google search will do it if you are interested and I am tired) and even those with vested interest have admitted there is no evidence whatsoever that there was ever any wandering in the desert. There is however great evidence that Jewish settlements existed in the land we know call the Middle-East, long before the supposed flight of the slaves.

**C**. Your point concerning vested interest. Those who have vested interest in telling you this story are either those who wish to bring you into their church or those who wish to keep you there. Why do you think there are so many splinter churches? I must pass 10 different church sects on my way to work every morning. Religion is a malignancy, it is passed on and can be very hard to shake off, if you have ever tried you have my sympathy, I have been there. I ask you though, as a fellow human being, to question your beliefs, that is all. Please, look rationally at the principals of your faith, the obvious sectarianism it causes, the logical sense of it's teachings and the moral authority of your holy book. You are not a sheep. You are a living, breathing human being. Your life is precious *because* it will never come again. Please, make the most of that fact. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Because Russia won't allow it. Thats why there is this whole mess going on now, because Russia is backing Assad, which makes him practically untouchable. That's why there has been all this fuss, otherwise the UN would have gone in as soon as Assad started killing his own people. 

The reason that there has still been no action in Syria doesn't have anything to do with democracy or the fact that most people don't want their country to intervene, it is because Russia has stated, quite openly, that a western intervention in Syria would be considered an act of war against Russia.

These are the facts, I have no idea why they are not wider known. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So the story is, boys and girls, I have recently scored a job as a DJ, no worries there, I've done it before I have a fairly sound few playlists for that, but the job is in a strip-club. I was wondering whats songs Reddit could recommend me for the ladies of easy virtue to dance to? What would make an awesome stripper song?


This is a self-post, I don't get karma for it, but I would appreciate a few upvotes for the sake of visibility! Thanks a lot guys, keep on kickin'! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Okay boys and girls, gather round and I shall tell you a tale...

In Nepal I crashed a motorbike while driving to the top of a mountain to visit a monastery. It was a big bastard of a bike as well, I was *very* lucky not to break any bones, just a few nasty cuts on my legs which I then patched up myself in my room with iodine and a reusable bandage. That was I think my second day in Nepal, near a town called Pokhara that used to be on the hippy trail. After recovering there for a few days I travelled to the capital, Kathmandu, and within a day or two decided I wanted to trek to Mount Everest Base Camp. To get there I had to fly from Kathmandu on this tiny little airplane that only could hold about 6 people and land deep in the Himalayas at an place called Lukla, which is, I think, the third most dangerous airport in the world in terms of crashes. From there I trekked, alone and with a still bandaged leg, for 9 days through the Himalayas before being forced to turn back because I developed mild AMS (Altitude Sickness) before I could reach base camp. I think it took me 7 days to walk back to Lukla. This was, by the way, through the Himalayas, on my own, with a 22KG backpack wearing Converse trainers, and it was probably the best month of my life, apart from the AMS and busted leg!

Come back next week to hear about the dead bodies in India or the cobra attack in Vietnam! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I travelled round the entire world when I was 18, completely self-financed and unassisted. I worked pretty much none stop for 2 years before I left to afford it and had some pretty wild experiences, the highlights probably being getting AMS (Acute Mountain Sickness, or Altitude Sickness) while climbing in the Nepalese Himalayas, coming face to face with a tiger in Thailand and getting rammed by a bull in Varanasi, India. I never talk about it though, because I don't want to sound big-headed. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The Holocaust.

When I was 16 I visited Auschwitz-Birkenau and it left a huge impression on me. What was unbelievable was the sheer organisation, it wasn't some ritualistic bloodletting or angry slaughter, it was an industrialised effort to efficiently, quietly and assertively wipe out not just one demographic of people, but anyone who was deemed less than human. There are rooms full of shoes, suitcases, clothes, Zyklon B canisters and human hair in Auschwitz, all of them representing individual people with thoughts, lives, parents, hopes and dreams of their own that were all wiped clean from the earth. I remember seeing a plaited ponytail in the room of hair, probably from shaven from a little girls head, and I don't think I will ever forget that detail.

This was the Summa of human evil and depravity and have left their mark on me. I have never since then said the name of that place aloud or discussed it, even with my closest friends of family.  After that experience though I cannot laugh or abide jokes about the Holocaust. Only those who do not understand what it cost humanity can make light of it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You might be referring to the testimony of the watchmen Frederick Fleet when describing the unusual atmospheric conditions that caused them not to spot the iceberg until too late, as there was no moon, no swell and the berg was of dark blue ice (common for icebergs that have recently flipped over) rendering it practically invisible from a distance, however Fleet would say that as it somewhat detracts the blame from himself as lookout.

There are many theories around The Californian as to why it did not come to Titanic's aid, for example that there may have been a third, unknown ship between Titanic and Californian that also happened to be displaying flares, or that Californian did not realise the Titanic was sinking. Both circumstances are extremely unlikely as all crew on the bridge of the Californian admit to seeing Titanic's distress signals and the Second Officer of Californian, Herbert Stone, whilst being question during the inquiry into the sinking admitted that he said to an apprentice "*Look at her* [Titanic] *now...she looks very queer out of the water; her lights are queer.*" Californian's Log book from the night of the sinking mysteriously vanished and all crew acted very evasive during questioning, so no one really knows why Californian failed to act.

Most of my source material here is from the book' Rough Guide to Titanic', so unfortunately I can't provide links, I'm sure all this is on the net somewhere though. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Personal Trainer here. Popular myths are that it is necessary to diet and work out. In some cases it is, but if you are just trying to be healthy eat normally and do lots of cardio work. 

Another myth, and a very common one, is that you lift a weight, and you gain muscles, easy! No. No, no, no! There are hundreds of different ways to use weights to build muscle, simply pumping a few weights without knowing what you're doing won't do it. You need to decide which muscles or muscle groups to work on and find out where your absolute strength/endurance limit is. Then add an extra 10lb. We call it 'systematic overload', you give you muscles slightly too much to cope with and it causes them to strengthen, think of it like supply and demand. Your body knows it needs more muscle to work, so it strengthens it. Simply throwing a few weights about won't do the trick. For arms or back the trick is to find a weight you struggle with and do about 3 sets of 12-15 reps. If you can finish the last set without crying, it's not heavy enough! It is very important to learn how to use weights properly though, make sure you get good instruction before doing anything big! Seriously!

The same is true of running. Again, get someone to teach you how to do it properly, or don't bother at all. You may think this is silly, but running incorrectly can put huge strain on you legs and ankles: I once broke my leg while training for a marathon! I developed a stress fracture and was dumb enough to ignore the pain and keep running on it, until it broke and I missed the marathon! So take gym safety seriously people!

**TL;DR** - read the damn post you lazy bastards, it's not that long!

**EDIT:** Okay a whole heap of rather pedantic people are taking issue with my 'don't worry about dieting' advice. The point here is that when a human body engages in large amounts of physical exercise, especially when the body in question is not used to strenuous exercise, it causes large amounts of muscle and tissue damage, which is good as that breaks down fat and causes muscles to grow. In order to repair and recover after a taxing workout, the body will be using several times more food matter, especially protein, than normal. If a person were to eat nothing but salad and then try to run a marathon, that person would collapse after half a mile. Depending on the exercise, it is vitally important to have a high calorie, high protein diet while engaging in extremely strenuous exercises. Now, as I'm sure not many people reading this are going to run any marathons in the near future, they don't need to up their calorie intake. Consciously reducing your calorie or protein intake however will give you less energy (ergo forcing you to abandon the workout sooner) and prevent proper muscle recovery, therefore it is advisable to continue eating normally, as the body will already be experiencing enough shock without an extra spanner in the works. Once a workout routine is established, you may wish to gradually migrate to a healthier diet.

 I have oversimplified somewhat here, but I hope I have made this understandable to all.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Wow, I'm amazed that no one actually knows this. The reason the UN (here incorrectly referred to as 'The West') has not intervened before in Syria is ***Russia***.

Russia is a close ally with Syria because Russia's oil supply is mostly distributed via pipelines that run through Syria. For that reason, Russia has made it extremely difficult for any kind of outside intervention to happen in Syria, as the message they are sending is simply '*you fuck with Assad, you fuck with us.*" It basically has meant that Al-Assad and the rest of the Syrian Government has basically had Carte-Blanche to do what it likes. The thing is they have now crossed so many lines that the world is starting to squirm, but still no action is being taken because no one wants to upset Russia. Any move to displace the Syrian Government, particularly by the US, would therefore be seen as a direct military move against Russia.

It is the same reason that North Korea is untouchable, except in that case it is China that prevents outside intervention. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Entropy. For the first time in history the rate of human population has started to increase at exponential speed. Before this present period in history the general population remained steady as life expectancy was far shorter and infant mortality was far more common. The world population only topped 1 billion in approximately 1810. Now there are 7 billion, a 2 billion increase in the last 20 years. This planet is an isolated system, we only have so much energy and as the population increases the energy becomes spread out far too wide and is rendered ultimately useless and finite. No new energy can be created capable of sustaining an exponentially growing population: the human race is, quite simply, unsustainable. The only hope is the discovery of a new boundless energy source (which on principal contradicts the first and second laws of thermodynamics), or extraterrestrial colonisation. It's going to be a scary century.

**EDIT:** Energy in this sense does not only pertain to electricity. Fuel in general is what is meant, be it mechanical, biological or simply food. Solar Power alone will not be enough to sustain humanity. </TEXT>
