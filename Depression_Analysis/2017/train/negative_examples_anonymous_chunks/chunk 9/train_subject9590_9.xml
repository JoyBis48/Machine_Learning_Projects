	<TEXT> Because they are hilarious entertainers who care so little about what people think and the career advancement opportunities going to Oscars gives them that they do something as insane as show up in dresses and on LSD? Keep in mind this is in like 1999 they weren't anywhere near as famous as today. Because they are able to keep composed at what was surely one of the weirdest experiences of their life. Even something as normal as a party is pretty weird if you're tripping and around a bunch of sober/drunk people. I can't even imagine what the Oscars is like. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Dude I can't believe they did that. Tripping at the Oscars while wearing a dress would be a little too much for me and I'm pretty well acquainted with acid. [You can see Trey almost lose it for a second in the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsvQuJmASSk#t=103), I can only imagine the feeling. Before I knew the story, I didn't think it was possible to respect them more than I did but I was wrong. They're at the very top of my list of living people to trip with for sure. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Let's say a method for delivering the antifreeze protein directly is discovered. Maybe it's a pill, maybe it's a lotion it doesn't matter. I'd imagine there probably wouldn't be a HUGE market for it but there would definitely be a market. Any extreme mountain climber who is going to be in the cold for extended periods of time would want to use it just to be safe. Going a step further, it might be possible to convince people they will be safer using it when they aren't really high risk for getting frostbite. By convincing parents to use it to keep their children playing outside in the snow safe or convincing skiers they might regret not using it, you might be able to get a much larger market. This could be done through some clever advertising campaigns.

Regardless what this affects most is definitely organ transplant and it could definitely be a game changer for that. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> How accurate or biased is the 'Century of the Self' documentary by Adam Curtis? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-02-25 22:26:56 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> The documentary really paints the picture that Edward Bernays is one of the most influential people of the 20th century. I feel like the intent of the  documentary was more to tell a compelling story than to showcase multiple points of view or interpretations of the events but I honestly have no idea. Hoping someone who is basing their view off more than a single documentary can let me know what they think of the film's accuracy or bias.

Saw this same question was [posted about two years ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/z2fs9/how_accuratebias_was_century_of_the_self/) but the responses seemed a bit underwhelming, hoping it's OK to repost. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I met Afroman when he was performing at a frat house in Alabama(went to Georgia Tech and happened to be in the same frat so we took a trip out there). I got to hang out with him in his trailer after the show and he was the funniest person I have ever met. 

Someone asked him about the football game that was the next day and he just goes 'Nigga I don't do sports, I do drugs that way I always win'. Whole night was filled with hilarious quotes like that he just made up. Someone asked him what kind of weed he buys and he goes 'Man I'm like the marijuana IRS I don't pay I just collect. Ended up getting his DJ's number (DJ Milkyway) and hung out with them a couple other times before and during their shows. I can proudly say I have smoked a blunt with Afroman while he sang Colt 45 on stage and rolled up to his shows with him for this show...

 Anyways he usually had this huge 6'7" black body guard. I'm convinced that dude just took that job because he liked kicking rich white kids asses as Afroman plays a lot of frat parties. Wonder why that guy wasn't with him

SSRIs are addictive, if you forget to take them one day, you feel really foggy headed and unable to really think properly to the point where it affects work and social life. The results of this experiment could easily be due to the withdrawal.  </TEXT>

 I think you just gotta answer confidently with something like this 'I'm one of those people who will talk your ear off if you get to know me but it takes me a little bit for me to warm up to groups of people'. or 'I dunno man, guess I'm just one of those people who only talks when I actually have something to say'.

 If the person who asks you is an asshole who talks to an excess and it seem like they are insulting you this one is a bit less nice  'Well I'm one of those people who only talks when *I actually have something to add to the conversation*'

	<TEXT> Asking this isn't always done with ill intentions.

	<TEXT> This is all contextual. If the person who asks you this is kind of an asshole who is one of those people that talks to an excess and they seem like they are insulting you you could say 'I'm one of those people who only talks when I actually have something to say'. This might make tensions a little high so be careful with that.

 If you're in a group of people many of whom you don't know well you might say 'I'm one of those people who will talk your ear off if you get to know me but it takes me a little bit for me to warm up to groups of people'. 

It you want to make a morbid joke that will make people really uncomfortable unless they realize your joking which they probably won't say 'Been like that since the accident man'. Actually don't say that one. 

Really option number 2 is your best bet unless you feel really insulted in which case I'd go with number 1.

	<TEXT> For me it was Charlie from Its Always Sunny

Obviously from that court episode where Charlie and Frank are caught naked and stuck in a chimney after trying to break into the Rodin museum. They were hoping to consult The Thinker when he comes alive that night to settle a domestic dispute. To explain why they weren't breaking and entering of course they tell the court a fantastical story. 

Like any other night Charlie and Frank were hanging out under the bridge after a long nights romp in the sewers. Charlie is given a book of spells by a friendly ghoul while Frank scavenges for bird eggs to eat. As Frank and Charlie begin to feast on the scavenged dove eggs, Charlie reads a spell that just so happens to be written in drawings and scribbles. Due to the eggs they are eating and Charlie's expertise for bird law the spell turns both Frank and Charlie into doves. They fly around the city for a while until a hawk, who obviously does not give a shit about bird law, starts hunting them. Fleeing for their life they find the nearest chimney to hide. The spell soon wears off and since their human clothes fell off when they became birds they are trapped naked in that chimney. Obviously they are completely not at fault and not dismissing the case would be like endorsing black magic. Charlie motions to counter sue the city of Philly for allowing black magic in the city limits and also to sue the hawk for flagrant disregard of birdlaw. </TEXT>

That is from the abstract of the paper. I'm not sure exactly how they confirmed it was lateral gene transfer though. I'd like to see just how similar the gene is between the slug and alga because you can't rule out this happening from a mutation of a already present gene in the slug. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The ReddHubV2 app for Windows 8 has a really neat feature, a Wikipedia expando that is very similar to a video or picture expando. It displays the text of the linked section or if the entire page is linked  it shows the article summary in-line with the comment but in a box of its own, kind of like how the self-post expandos work when you are browsing the frontpage of a subreddit. It is incredibly useful and I just thought it would be very cool in RES too. The presences of /u/autowikibot shows that Reddit users like to be able see the wiki text without actually clicking the link and it makes a lot of sense to have something like this. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For example if I posted a comment which netted me 53 karma right before I went to bed, when I load up reddit the next day I would see a green (+53) next to my current comment karma in the display at the top of each reddit page. If it was -53, it would be red. Same deal with each refresh.

Not sure if this would be possible but I figure you could maybe store the current karma client-side at each page load and then do a quick calculation to see how it has changed. If reddit's fuzzing algorithm would mess up the small increments of 1 or 2 comment karma maybe just make it so it only happens if a sizable karma change is detected. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Before any type of treatment can be made widely available, it's efficacy and safety must be proved. This process occurs through the following phases and can take years or even decades:

* Phase I: Researchers test a new drug or treatment in a small group of people for the first time to evaluate its safety, determine a safe dosage range, and identify side effects.

* Phase II: The drug or treatment is given to a larger group of people to see if it is effective and to further evaluate its safety.

* Phase III: The drug or treatment is given to large groups of people to confirm its effectiveness, monitor side effects, compare it to commonly used treatments, and collect information that will allow the drug or treatment to be used safely.

* Phase IV: Studies are done after the drug or treatment has been marketed to gather information on the drug's effect in various populations and any side effects associated with long-term use. 

I'm not exactly sure what phase this trial was, but it is either I or II and although it looks promising the long term effects simply are not definitively known yet. This treatment is especially extreme, very expensive and taxing on the body. It would be highly irresponsible to start treating a large population of patients with something that has not been proven safe or effective yet. Like you mentioned, there is a high probability that this "miracle cure" doesn't pan out for whatever reason and if this is because of serious health side effects, you want to find that out before you give it to a bunch of people who are not in immediate life-threatening danger. Unfortunately this is just how science and medicine work and sometimes it seems pretty callous. Maybe you can take solace in the fact that others may not have to suffer the way your cousin did due to treatments like this one. </TEXT>
