	<TITLE> Does anyone else ever re-enact real life tragedies when you play GTA or a similar game? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> When playing GTA, I have gotten bored and at times decided to do this. Here are some examples,

- Standing on top of a building with a sniper rifle and waiting to shoot the passenger of a convertible. (Kennedy assassination)

- Shooting up a fast food resturant. (San Ysidro McDonalds Massacre)

- Flying a commercial jet into a skyscraper while shouting "Death to America" and "Allahu Akhbar" in a mock Middle Eastern accent. (9/11)

- Doing typical GTA rampages in a black Senitnel (BMW 3 series coupe) since it closely resembles Elliot Rodger's car.

- I tried to see if I could find a church with an accessible interior in order to do the recent AME church shooting, but didn't find one. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> The Mercedes E Class is available as a sedan, wagon, coupe, and convertible and so was/is the BMW 3 Series. The Audi A3 is available as a sedan, wagon, convertible, and hatchback. Up until the about the 70's or 80's, most mainstream American and Japanese cars such as the Chevrolet Impala or Datsun 510 came in a full range of body styles. My guess as to why this ended is because the demand for coupes and wagons is no longer big enough for non-luxury manufacturers to offer a full line like this. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Cadillac, in 1970, still had it all together and were still producing what were seen as the premier American luxury car. As the decade went on, they became bigger and more garish, until they downsized in 1977. From 1971 on, they also cheapened their cars and decreased quality control. By the mid 1980's they came out with the downsized, front-wheel-drive econobox looking Cimarron, DeVille, Eldorado, and Seville. The cars also became more attainable from 1971 on, and more so by the 80's, competing with less prestigious Buicks, Oldsmobiles, Chryslers, and Mercurys. Currently, Mercedes-Benz still makes good cars, but some of them are relatively garish and they also recently introduced the lower priced, standard front wheel drive CLA and GLA. The CLA and GLA compete to an extent with loaded Toyotas, Hondas, Chevys, etc. Both brands seem to have introduced lower-priced models to profit off their preceived prestige that was acquired over many decades. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As a regular reader of [Curbside Classic](http://www.curbsideclassic.com), and an occasional reader of [Old Parked Cars](http://www.oldparkedcars.com), two sites based in Portland that write mainly about old cars that are not in show condition and have been found parked on the streets by their authors, I was expecting to see a lot more old shitboxes. In particular, I was surprised that these albums didn't include a bunch of diesel Benzes and 70s-80s American cars (in both poor and well maintained condition, but generally poor), as those sites seem to make those types of cars seem really common there. The Saabs, Volvos, E30s, Benzes, Eagle Premier, and Japanese cars however, are in line with their typical fodder. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The Buick Regal and Lesabre weren't exactly cars that the public oohed and ahhhed over.

From regularly reading Curbside Classic, I've heard that Regals and Cutlasses were considered aspirational vehicles in middle America during their time. They had a reputation as a middle class "I made it" or "I've grown up" car in a way similar to how people today view the BMW 3 Series. </TEXT>
