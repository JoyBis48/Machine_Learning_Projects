	<TEXT> With a hammer mod I don't see why a clone would be a problem, but my girl only buys clone tube mods. She's bought two so far, and both have fallen apart on her. So I'd be a little careful at least. Rdas are pretty basic, so I don't see any problems with buying a clone of them.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have an authentic myself, but I've seen some pretty great clones too. I won't buy any clones personally, it just seems like the quality is often times worth the price.

Plus bragging rights! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've done a little of it myself but I really like machining fantasy weapons. When I was younger I went to a festival with her and there was this guy who had a truck he blew glass out of. The whole side of the truck folded out into a stage and he'd do shows. It was pretty awesome haha. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The hog is my favorite mod by far. Just wish I could carry it a bit easier! That dewberry cream actually belongs to my woman, I can't stand it honestly. When I bought it for her I thought I'd just use the dripper from a 30 to get it out but I eventually just had to use a funnel. Definitely not my favorite bottle! </TEXT>
