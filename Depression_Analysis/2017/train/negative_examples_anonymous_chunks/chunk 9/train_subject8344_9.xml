	<TEXT> Why do people live back East where hurricanes and tornadoes hit all the time? There is always something. 

And by-the-way, that big earthquake has been supposedly coming now for decades. I'm sure it will eventually but we have too many others things to worry about in the present to freak about something that may never happen in our lifetime.

And this year it is drought. Next year it will probably be floods. It's always something. You can't escape it. </TEXT>

I run an assistance subreddit here. I actually help people. And I am attacked on a daily basis by the trolliest trolls of them all. But I don't let them bother me. In fact I rarely even reply to them. The trolling is out of hand but the last thing in the world you can do is to let them know they are getting to you. If you do, you are history. </TEXT>
