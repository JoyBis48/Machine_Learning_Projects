	<TEXT> Man, if this wasn't a under the table PR move by the Admins, I don't know what is. Listen to the rhetoric. Now she's the martyred savior and Pao has apologized, so she tells us to feel good about having our voices heard. They had all weekend think up this idea. Convincing the person you axed to make one more positive platitudinous statement that doesn't sully you name seems like the obvious way to go to appease the masses. 

The difference is between the Admins and the users? The Admins know how PR and the media cycle works. The users fucked it up when they tried make noise over a holiday weekend. </TEXT>
