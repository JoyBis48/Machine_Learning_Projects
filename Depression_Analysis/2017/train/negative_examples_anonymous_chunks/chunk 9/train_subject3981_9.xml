	<TEXT> I don't. Intel is misleading as hell. They are currently replacing former Haswell-based Celerons and Pentiums that cost $100-$160, with Atoms, and calling them the same. And the worst part is nobody is really figuring it out. Intel is selling $30 chips for $160. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Giving the fingerprint data to a 3rd party or even a 2nd party's servers is *never* acceptable.

Plus, there now ways to use a fingerprint to authenticate to a third party site, too. Check out Microsoft's Passport technology, which will also be part of FIDO 2.0. It will authenticate [locally](http://www.tomshardware.com/news/windows-hello-passport-passwordless-login,28767.html), and then create a public key to authenticate you to another site (or something along those lines). Your fingerprint data will never have to leave the device to log you to other sites.


So we only have to wait a year or so until we get that. There's no need to risk our fingerprints to someone else's servers right now. </TEXT>

Remember you can't actually *change* your fingerprint if it's take like this. This would affect you for the rest of your life, and we're only going to use fingerprint readers more in the future. You don't want it to be in the hackers' databases and rival countries' databases.

This is MUCH WORSE than them having your social security number. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Since we're on the crazy speculation train, here's one for you.

"Anonymous" could be anyone, including the FBI. In fact the last time "Anonymous" was a strong group and did all of those "operations", one of their main guys, who had a role in *coordinating* the attacks, was an [FBI mole](http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/dec/09/hacker-sabu-defends-informing-anonymous-fbi-interview).

So what if it's the FBI that hacked the NYSE, in the same day that the chief of FBI was doing a [Senate hearing](https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2015/07/08/fbi-doj-name-new-enemy-crypto-wars-apple-google/) on encryption backdoors and trying to tell the world how we're all doomed if they don't get their backdoors?

Too crazy for the FBI to be trying to do a false flag operation like that just to get the US population to support encryption backdoors (their holy grail apparently), especially when they seem pretty desperate that the House is against their proposals (seen in the last 2 House hearings)?! 

Would that be  more or less crazy than FBI ["assisting"](http://fair.org/home/zero-for-40-at-predicting-attacks-why-do-media-still-take-fbi-terror-warnings-seriously/) dozens of [terrorist plots](http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2013/01/terror-factory-fbi-trevor-aaronson-book) on U.S. soil?

Or it could be only a technical error, like the NYSE has [already said](https://www.nyse.com/market-status/history). </TEXT>

And I bet in 2-3 years they'll write off the $8 billion Skype acquisition, too, because there's no way they will recover that money by the half of the 21st century. Unless they're counting all [DoD contracts](http://www.geekwire.com/2013/score-microsoft-defense-department-windows/) as [ROI](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/02/12/nsa_offers_billions_for_skype_pwnage/) for the [Skype business](http://www.networkworld.com/article/2220079/microsoft-subnet/microsoft-patent-may-ruin-skype--may-make-voip-spy-and-pry-easy-for-gov-t.html). </TEXT>

I don't even know what that means. You realize American corporations, just like UK corporations and German corporations and Chinese corporations are hit by hacking attempts all the time, right?

It seems silly to phrase it that way. </TEXT>

Oh what a load of crap. This is because Windows 10 couldn't be finished on time. So they decided to release it only to a small group first to make sure their unfinished Windows 10 doesn't brick too many people's PCs.

	<TEXT> Nu. Ce e cu atata "reunificare" dupa zeci si sute de ani? O luam si noi pe urma Rusiei? Incepem sa cerem si ce pamanturi ne-o mai fi luat Ungaria si Ucraina dupa aia?

Mi se pare stupid sa vii dupa 100 de ani sa "ceri pamantul inapoi" sau chestii de genul. Pe urma acestor lucruri se pornesc multe razoaie, care ar fi putut fi completat evitate daca nu ar exista lacomia (pentru resurse...ceea ce nu e cazul aici) si simtul asta de "reunificare".

Si nici nu mai vorbesc de faptul ca o reunificare cu Republica Molvoda ne-ar saraci pe toti, pentru ca Romania ar trebui sa dea lor si celor de acolo pentru pensii, scoli, drumuri si toate cele, la fel de multi cum se da si aici. </TEXT>
