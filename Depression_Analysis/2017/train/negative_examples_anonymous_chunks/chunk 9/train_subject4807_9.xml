**tl;dr** All trade unions are labor unions. There are differences in how various unions are structured (and more so every day), but all are governed by the same laws and consider each other equal partners in the struggle for workers' rights and dignity. The claim that they are "two completely separate things" is simply wrong.

Yeah, no. From the tone of your comments, you stopped caring before you started this discussion. I'm a mod elsewhere, so I know how to deal with users who break the rules. You completely failed to cushion your explanation with compassion -- and instead, accused the OP of "ignoring" you when she was merely pointing to how confusing this rule can be even when the user is not dealing with shock and grief.

You're off balance here. This exchange should have been about explaining the rules to someone who made a sincere mistake, not about spanking a naughty child. Modding is a tough job, but you really can do better than this. </TEXT>

The vet most likely had a legal obligation to treat any rabid animal the way she did Jiggie, and you could offer no assurance that it couldn't possibly be rabies, because you had allowed Jiggie to run loose. 

Some jurisdictions will allow a possibly rabid animal to live through a waiting period rather than kill it and dissect the brain (the only conclusive test), but even if your town allows this it won't matter because suing over veterinary care is something only a very wealthy person even *can* do.

The vet you went to lacks people skills, but suing won't change anything. Please just concentrate on remembering Jiggie at her strongest and best. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It wasn't a police brutality protest, although many of those people are also involved in that work.

The event today was [the Ohio Student Association](http://www.ohiostudentassociation.org/end_zero_tolerance) statewide protest about zero-tolerance school discipline policies. The press advisory explaining the goals of the  demonstration is [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DdXbYlyHXnUwYTj08oRvvF0nD5RR6VX43XnXLqhD2wY/edit?pli=1). It will be interesting to see how this is covered on the 6:00 local news; at noon Ch. 4 managed to cover a different story from across the street from the education Department and the OSA demo was so loud it was hard to hear the reporter -- but they had no coverage of this event.

OSA is a relatively new but very impressive organization. It's part of [the Ohio Organizing Collaborative](http://www.ohorganizing.org/) which has member groups (including unions) all over the state, and an innovative approach to organizing that mobilizes and trains young people to be effective leaders in various reform struggles, including elimination of student debt.

For these reasons and more, OSA was voted the Community Festival Honored Community Organization for 2015 -- see page 15 [here](http://apgmediaofohio.com/emags/Comfest2015/index.html). </TEXT>

My theory on housework is, if the item doesn't multiply, smell, catch fire, or block the refrigerator door, let it be. No one else cares. Why should you?

	<TEXT> I wouldn't give money to this nonprofit, and -- speaking as a nonprofit administrator --  I would not recommend to anyone that they do, either. 

In the first place, there's no evidence that this IS a non-profit, aside from OP's assertion. There's no website, no link to evidence of an IRS charter or even sponsorship by an existing 501(c)(3), no board of directors. Not only is there absolutely nothing to inspire confidence, but there's one huge red flag: the most developed post on the FB page is a series of photos of a particular old mansion these folks propose to "fix up for transitional housing" -- this from people who admit elsewhere that they have no idea beyond bake sales for fundraising.

And all that is just from looking at the material OP presented to *this* reddit. [The most compelling reasons why no one should give money to this group are in the answers to the disturbingly basic question the OP raised over at /r/nonprofit.](https://np.reddit.com/r/nonprofit/comments/3d9m83/struggling_college_student_executive_director_of/)

OP, I think you're probably sincere. But *you need to listen* to those folks. If you really want to help, be humble enough to volunteer for the established groups already working on these issues, and learn all the things that go into nonprofit work.   </TEXT>

I used to just ignore the complaints about his karma-whoring, but this consequence of keeping info about rescue orgs from people who could support them has put me on the warpath about sourcing. It's just not that hard, and it really matters. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What, exactly, are they looking for? Temporary housing, or what?

Adding, this general question, having to be asked by a third party *on a Saturday*, is a nightmare. One has to wonder: how did they come to be evicted -- under a law that requires plenty of notice -- without having explored options for themselves? I'm not blaming them. I've watched folks nearing the bottom of their resources go into a glazed state and so fail to ask for help in a timely way. It just hurts to watch, every time.

Anyway, tell us more specifics, and maybe someone here can offer specific help.     </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A good article, but the headline makes it sound more crass than it really is. The money the author spent was shocking to her *in retrospect*, but it's clear that she was deciding on the basis of love (as she understood it then) as things went along and only noticing the financial cost later ... when she also belatedly recognized the cost in pain these treatments caused Kitty, and admitted having prioritized her own feelings above Kitty's well-being.

The decision to euthanize a beloved pet is always agonizing, and this author seems to have arrived at a better than average standard for making such decisions. Thanks to the OP for sharing that, and for opening up this discussion here. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  I wonder if vets would allow me to post on their boards even if I'm not a customer? 

Yes, they probably will. As for places that will take 6 cats: probably no landlord will go for this. And that's why millions of renters lie about how many cats they have. As long as your rent is paid on time, and the cats aren't stinky or noisy, most landlords will choose an otherwise good tenant over the hassle of eviction and starting over to find a new tenant. I do think 6 in an apartment is probably too many for their sake, but if you haven't re-homed some/all of them by the time you move maybe you can keep them while you continue to look for new homes.

Offering one cat at a time really is best. Include some details about the cat's personality: what kind of toys it likes, what silly things it does, how it interacts with others, etc. Emphasize that there is a deadline (even if it's not firm) and that you're being slightly picky about who you'll allow to have your kitty. People are more likely to respond to the implied challenge of "are you good enough to adopt this particular wonderful cat?" than they are to the implied carelessness of "I've got too many cats -- want one?" 

Good luck!

	<TEXT> Buying boots this close to the hike is not a good idea: they could not possibly be broken in before you start. OTOH, sneakers won't cut it. You should immediately buy a pair of trail runners or lowcut hiking shoes -- something that has serious tread and arch/ankle support, but will break in fast. Merrell has some shoes that don't require long break-in; Hi-Tec specializes in shoes that are wearable right out of the box (but don't last for as long as others).

More important is that this question raises another question: whether you've bitten off more than you can chew here. How accustomed are you to long-distance hiking? How strong are your knees? Have you backpacked much? Do you live at sea level? All of these questions are important, and if you give us more detail we can give you more help.

Two points that will help, no matter what your experience:  
(1) remember to cut your toenails before starting out; and
(2) you can make the whole trip easier by sending your pack and tent down and up again by mule. It costs $68.42 each way and is totally worth it. If you decide to use the [mule duffel service](http://www.grandcanyonlodges.com/lodging/phantom-ranch/duffel-services/) just on way, make it the downhill trip. That's much harder than the uphill, especially if you're going down the Kaibab and up BA.

A lot of memories have faded by now, but the plague of people falling down and passing out *on the sidewalk* is unfortunately still vivid, along with the epidemic of date rapes that pushed us to start the first rape crisis center in Ohio.

	<TEXT> Quaaludes -- also called "sopors" -- are a soporific (sleeping pill) that had a sudden rush of popularity in the early 70s as a recreational drug, with a very significant usage as a date-rape drug. 

There was a theory advanced by radical anti-war activists (mainly Yippies and the underground press, starting from Ann Arbor) that there was government involvement in the sudden widespread street-level availability of such "death drugs" -- as opposed to pot and LSD -- intended to blunt the rising popular opposition to the Viet Nam war and the recession. 

[Here is a 1973 article about the national anti-sopor campaign](http://freeingjohnsinclair.aadl.org/node/195689), showing the "WAKE UP! No more sleeping pills in our community" graphic that appeared on thousands of T-shirts and millions of posters that year. And [here is a history of Quaaludes](http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/features/unconsciousness-expansion-the-sopor-story-19730329) published that same year by Rolling Stone. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The first appearance of Quaaludes as a recreational drug was late 1970. There was a grassroots campaign at the time, started by activists in Ann Arbor and spread through the underground press, to convince young people to not use the drug. I still have my ["Wake Up! No more sleeping pills in our community" ](http://freeingjohnsinclair.aadl.org/node/195689) shirt, along with some leaflets and news articles ... somewhere in storage.

EDIT: [Here's a BIG flashback about the drug we called Sopors.](http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/features/unconsciousness-expansion-the-sopor-story-19730329) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I know the headline here is a quote from the subject of this article, but as a headline it's tone deaf: most of the new social energy around climate change is coming from precisely "faith-based arguments that deal with climate change" -- from the opposite direction. When the Pope issued his Encyclical last week calling for a moral campaign against human-made climate change, he was standing on the base built over the past few years by many other religious leaders who say stewardship of the planet is a basic responsibility for people of faith. So this headline is just seriously odd, not to mention confusing.

	<TEXT> First, thank you for taking care of these kitties. You've done a good thing, and trolls can't change that.

Some questions:  
How old are they? Are they all neutered and vaccinated?    
Have your posts included photos? Have you advertised them all together, or separately? 
Have you posted to other local reddits, including school-specific ones?
How fast do you have to move on this? Is there an external pressure, or is it just time to move them along?

I don't have any magic trick. In my experience (I re-homed dozens of kittens over several years in another city), it comes down to sheer persistence and highlighting each cat individually. For leaflets and online posts, a good portrait photo plus a compelling back story helps. I've also gone to the extreme of taking the kittens to a place where they would be seen -- the parking lot of a gourmet grocery store or a popular restaurant on a Saturday afternoon -- and letting people hold them, which increases attraction exponentially. (I wouldn't hand them over permanently at first contact. Anyone interested in adopting would have to come by the next day and go through the interview.) 

You're doing the right things. Keep on keeping on with those, and keep asking for more help. In my experience, friends and family will make one perfunctory effort when you first ask, but it's only when you become relentless that something finally works. Don't be afraid of being the squeaky wheel!

	<TEXT> He's the exception. I meant, he has zero chance *absent the intervention of a whole other network of volunteers trying to mitigate the effects of bad shelter policy.* Those networks can save only a fraction of the cats condemned by the failure to implement good public policy (subsidized spay/neuter; comprehensive humane education; mandatory licensing, etc.).  </TEXT>

And why are you talking to the police about fire codes?
