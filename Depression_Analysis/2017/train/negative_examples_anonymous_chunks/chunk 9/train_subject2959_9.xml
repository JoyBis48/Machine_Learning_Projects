	<TEXT> Bought a pair of [these boots](http://www.jcpenney.com/shoes/extended-sizes/large-sizes-13-over/stafford-deacon-mens-wingtip-leather-boots/prod.jump?ppId=pp5004560043 catId=cat100250175 topDim=Brand topDimvalue=stafford dimCombo=Brand%7C dimComboVal=stafford%7C currentDim=Brand currentDimVal=stafford _dyncharset=UTF-8 colorizedImg=DP0902201417014697M.tif urlState=/shoes/shop-men-s-shoes/dress-shoes/stafford/_/N-1nopj3Z7i/cat.jump) a few months ago after seeing them on this subreddit. My question is could I pair them with a grey suit? Or are they too casual?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Like seriously Jade is the only one who realistically would move to Iowa. Whitney would never leave her job, Kaitlyn seems like she isn't ready to get married and have children, and lets be real Becca is so flat and one-dimensional, if she doesn't go home next episode I'm breaking my tv. </TEXT>
