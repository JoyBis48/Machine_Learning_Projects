	<TEXT> "Before the older laws"? Britain's tighter gun laws began in 1903 and were tightened much further throughout the 1920s and 1930s, then repeatedly again ever since. Handguns have been hard to get for many decades, which correlates with declining homicide rates. An interesting comparison is with Japan, where handguns were still in wide circulation after World War Two, and where homicide rates were nearly as high as in the US, and several times higher than in Britain--until the Japanese banned handguns and homicide rates plunged to near British levels.

Politically, that's a struggle in some places, especially conservative ones, but the twin needs to cut carbon pollution and rein in runaway freeway spending demand change. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> China is now making huge strides, leading the world in solar power, new dam building, new nuclear plants; they are implementing carbon taxes and pledging more than $6 trillion to decarbonize in the next twenty years. To put that last figure in context, China will spend almost as much on decarbonization as the US spends on its military. For a country that was desperately poor only a generation ago, which has built its economy entirely on massive coal power, that's stunning progress. 

Now it's India that we have to worry most about. </TEXT>

In terms of emissions per person, Americans are still five times worse than Chinese (although not as bad as Aussies, Qataris and a few others).

	<TEXT> The Lloyd's report's scenario:

"A strong warm-phase of the El Nio Southern Oscillation (ENSO) develops in the central equatorial Pacific Ocean. Flooding develops in the Mississippi and Missouri rivers, reducing production of maize in the
US by 27%, soybean by 19% and wheat by 7%. Severe drought reminiscent of 2002 hits India, while parts of Nepal, Bangladesh, northeastern India and Pakistan are hit by torrential rainfall, flooding and landslides. Severe drought affects eastern and southeastern Australia and Southeast Asia. In India, wheat production is reduced by 11% and rice by 18%. In Bangladesh and Indonesia, rice is reduced by 6%, and rice production falls in Vietnam
by 20%, and by 10% in Thailand and the Philippines.
In Pakistan, wheat production is reduced by 10% due to flooding. Australian wheat is reduced by 50% by drought. Asian soybean rust expands throughout Argentina and Brazil, causing an epidemic. In Argentina, soybean production is reduced by 15%, with a 5% drop in Brazil. The Ug99 wheat stem rust pathogen is windblown throughout the Caucasus and further north; Turkey, Kazakhstan and Ukraine suffer 15% production losses in wheat, while Pakistan and India lose an additional 5% on top of existing flood and drought damage. Russian wheat production declines by 10%.

"Wheat, maize and soybean prices increase to quadruple the levels seen around 2000. Rice prices increase 500% as India starts to try to buy from smaller exporters following restrictions imposed by Thailand. Public agricultural commodity stocks increase 100% in share value, agricultural chemical stocks rise 500% and agriculture engineering supply chain stocks rise 150%. Food riots break out in urban areas across the Middle East, North Africa and Latin America. The euro weakens and the main European stock markets lose 10% of their value; US stock markets follow and lose 5% of their value. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sounds to me as if we have every reason to be alarmed. Did you read the linked Lloyd's report on which this is based? This is from one of the world's largest insurers, mind you.

The last food shocks spawned the Arab Spring revolts and the rise of ISIS. These coming shocks could do much worse, possibly leading to violent fascist states across much of the poor world, and likely dragging richer countries into the mess. If, that is, we fail to slash global carbon emissions soon--or maybe even if we do, given that much warming is already baked in. 

The question is, can we get over our love of pickup trucks and our aversion to foreign aid in time? I'm not entirely sure that we can. Fasten your seat belt. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The most telling difference is the way Americans treat immigrants, and policies towards them, which are generally less nasty (in the case of Latinos) and sometimes adoring (towards Brits). No wars were fought here over the rights of immigrants, but a big one was fought over the ownership of blacks, and that was followed by more than a century of continued legal discrimination against them. The end of that era under two Democrat presidents helped blacks, but it was a huge slap in the faces of southern whites who had long measured their self worth by their supposed racial superiority, driving them into the Republican Party. 

Race, more than anything else, has always defined nearly every aspect of American politics. Immigrant issues come and go, but not this gaping wound. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> By "acting now" I don't assume that all fossil fuel burning would end tomorrow. We have 27 years to accomplish thais at present rising emissions trends. We might push that out to 40-50 years if we start cutting emissions now. That is time enough to do this gracefully. Most credible economic forecasts show that this might shave around 0.2% off the global growth rate (3.3% annual growth rather than 3.5%, for example), so it wouldn't be free, but it really wouldn't cost much, either. More important, it would *prevent* much, much higher costs due to future warming. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  That toughness leads to foci of deprivation that stand in contrast to the wealth of the rest of the society...Both the foci of deprivation and prison are racially disparate, for whatever reasons.

For whatever reasons? That is a rhetorical qualifier that few Americans would make. We know too well what reasons are at issue. Persistent racism, segregation, social dysfunction and mistrust all dramatically raise the costs of government services. We spend tons more on prisons and police than other nations do. We feel a greater need to arm ourselves against our fellow citizens than people in other countries do, which, in turn, leads to high costs for violence. We lack an efficient universal healthcare system because too many of us see it as a subsidy for poor blacks. 

On the systemic side, by moving to (and remaining in) rural areas and states, which are accorded greater political power by law, racists also achieve disproportionate political influence, which incurs all kinds of direct and indirect costs (more support for road spending, which puts distance between "us" and "them"; more support for prisons, which are both racial weapons as well as rural jobs machines, etc.). 

All of these problems reach a zenith in the former slave states, which is why many of them remain among the poorest states requiring the most Federal help.

Wars are expensive, and many (not all) American conservatives are dedicated to regarding blacks as a kind of internal military threat that must be contained, while some blacks respond in kind. It's a very costly, very old mess that completely skews comparisons with all other rich nations.

	<TEXT> Yeah, but this is the *state government* we're talking about. A state government that was the very first to commit treason against the United States in 1861, and which, under that flag, killed thousands of Americans while enslaving thousands more. 

Don't just lower the flag; sell tickets for the right to shit on it, and hand the proceeds to the descendants of slaves. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Okay, here's a thought experiment: rather than outlawing murder and rape, shouldn't we just make them expensive? 

No, because that would simply give license to the wealthy to commit whatever horrors they like, and murder and rape are absolutely intolerable. Same here. Carbon pollution must end altogether; in fifty or sixty years there will be no tolerance for it. We won't allow *anyone* to burn fossil fuels. 

No doubt, carbon taxation is the best first step towards decarbonization, but it cannot be the last step.

	<TEXT> I'm a fan. However, some conditions:

 An emissions tax must be high enough to change behavior *and* to account for the price of damages caused by carbon pollution. That would be at least $40/ton (the official US Gov figure for the social cost of carbon, and too low at that). No one is currently proposing a tax level this high.

 A carbon tax must return its revenues to taxpayers in order to prevent a shift of tax burdens from rich to poor, and to prevent the economic drag that comes from tax hikes.

 A carbon tax must eventually pair with a carbon cap. The great flaw in carbon taxation is that it doesn't actually outlaw burning carbon, which is what the world must do. However, it can delay that ban and reduce its pain. </TEXT>

You do realize that this is because getting an illegal handgun is just so freaking easy in the U.S., where guns flood the streets and run down the gutters with each spring rain, right? Just try finding a handgun to buy on short notice in the U.K. or Japan, for example. Getting a connection will likely take days if not weeks, and then you'll pay a fortune, *and* you'll face serious charges if anyone finds out about your illegal pistol. Consequently, handguns don't get carried around all the time as in the U.S., so they don't just pop out and end arguments badly as they do here. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No, carbon taxes would not ignore methane. The only significant human-caused gas it would ignore is NOx, which is very easily regulated by other means. Water vapor is another, but it is a biproduct of warming by CO2 and CH4. So, yes, a carbon tax could be quite effective--if it is steep enough. 

I like the Citizen's Climate Lobby plan: a carbon fee-and-dividend that would return all revenues equally to each citizen, giving people some resources to adjust their living, boosting consumer spending at the same time to overcome the economic drain of an additional tax. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Low income families pay [almost no income tax](http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/mt/assets/business/trythis3.png) now, so this wouldn't change much on the low end. However, on the high end, this would be huge: 49% of all income taxes are paid by those making more than $250K ([source](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/03/24/high-income-americans-pay-most-income-taxes-but-enough-to-be-fair/)). Those of us in the middle would have to pay for massive tax cuts to the rich. 

Meanwhile, even the poor get screwed as state and local governments raise regressive taxes on them to make up for the shortfall in Federal money for roads, transit, emergency services, healthcare, parks, law enforcement, care of public lands, etc.. For example, fishing at the local roadside now requires a much more costly license, plus an even pricier parking permit, so that even catching fish for dinner is out of the reach of many.

Aren't you getting a little tired of all this? I certainly am. </TEXT>
