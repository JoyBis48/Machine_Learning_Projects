	<TEXT> Don't write off the possibility of demonic involvement. I remember experiencing this multiple times, having a feeling of another presence within the room, and only alleviating when I called upon the name of Jesus. It also would happen right when I started feeling courageous about my faith and considered stepping out further than my comfort zone. I know /r/christianity likes to take the more naturalistic approach to most topics like this and psych related topics, but remember, we battle against not flesh and blood, but the principalities of spiritual darkness. So, never discount the presence of Lucifer and his minions and look to Jesus in prayer and humility, as his authority is above all - and we are His children. Fear Not.  </TEXT>

At least there they would only be squabbling with Native Americans, of which we've more or less already got locked down in reservations. There must be something REAL special about that shit middle east that someone far wiser than I was able to visualize way back after world war II. Maybe its the highest concentration of stargates in the world. Just a guess. Cuz we got some of those in Arizona too.  </TEXT>

Winning the 2015 Hugo Award, This story first it intrigued me, then it amused me, then it gripped me then I laughed out loud. Once complete immersed into the world of the story, I next shared the creatures curiosity, their fear, and finally their awe. I relished every transition, every change in tempo, every interaction, the precision in each characterization. And in the end when I finally understood just what was happening and what it meant I experienced that rare joy that only the best science fiction stories seem to offer: that feeling of a gradually increasing cognitive dissonance due to my assumptions not quite matching up with where the story is going and then the aha moment when I finally understood that the scope of this subcreation is larger and more nuanced than I first anticipated. Its positively rapturous when all the parts that seem out of place just suddenly fall together. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You're missing the point, friend. You must first ask, did he do anything at all? Or were the Boston bombings a government orchestrated event created to continue to disarm the population and control through the instinctual sense of fear? Luciferian at its core. This boy, and his brother, were simply what they call "fall guys", whom the blame is placed, to divert the true narrative away from the masses. The news reports and we listen. What's to stop satan from polluting that aspect of our life equally so. May God give you discernment. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This man is innocent. Lucifer, through the agent of the mass media, has duped us once again. The only Kingdom that we should trust is a Heavenly one, and I feel its pretty clear that our "great country" no longer holds the interest of "we the people". False Flags are prevalent throughout history and there's always a need for a "fall guy". Notice how we never even heard an appeal from this man. He never once had a voice. Your prayers should be directed towards the mercy of this mans soul for he is dying for a lie. How sorrowful this world is. </TEXT>

Your prayers should be directed towards the individuals that have wrongfully accused this man and that God have mercy on an innocent man. I advise you the only government that should reign truth into your heart is the Lord and His kingdom. All governments and their contrived perspectives of "their people" are simply and undoubtedly under the hand of the Prince of all Lies, Lucifer.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Does Jesus forgive us - Past, Present and Future sin? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-05-01 14:18:01 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Touched on often, but still a continuing question. I've always been curious about how other Christians feel once they've sinned again and knowing they may repeat that sin in the future? Will Jesus continue forgiving us? Or is there a cut off where someone was never saved in the first place? Is this question far too legalistic? Thank you for your responses ahead of time :) </TEXT>

Please pray that I will no longer be ME but be Christ and understand that I am you and you are me and rest in peace that is found in the unconditional love of the Son and father and spirit.  </TEXT>

A good place to begin is to read the gospels written of Jesus and to talk to real life christians about why they became christians and how they found truth and spiritual freedom in that belief. YouTube is also awfully useful for good testimonies :) God bless friend! God has already blessed you enough to be curious :D </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Comedy, much like any skill, requires practice. Boys, from a very young age, are encouraged to hone these skills. That's why a woman would dominate a man in interior design, fashion sense and any other activity that a woman is told is normal from the time they can walk. It's 95% societal. Girls get dressed in pink, boys in blue. While subject A is amazing at coordinating outfits and applying eyeliner, subject B is fantastic at making dick jokes. It's all learned behavior, and sure, it may be minutely biologically to some degree, but stand up comedians and runway models don't just WAKE UP on stage one morning.  </TEXT>
