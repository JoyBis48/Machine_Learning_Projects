I know a doctor who used to study under a cancer specialist in California. she said that this guy unlocked the cure for cancer in the pancreas of a pig. had years of studies and proof that it worked, and once the guy tried to publish a work or whatever it's called on it, guy gets taken out and his place gets ransacked. coincidence? curing disease and helping people doesn't make money and the government knows it. all I'm saying is, if it is government mandated that everyone get vaccinated, in today's corrupt governmental system, I want no part of it. and, the medical industry is just as corrupt as the government under which it serves.

But you used "there" when you should have used "their", forgot the "e" in "use", didn't punctuate that whole sentence properly either, you used "then" when you should have used "than", and you said "as" instead of "has".  So you don't get to call me an idiot either, jackass. 

And as for all the BS proclamations you declared fact, you're wrong. It's actually not true that he juiced in high school. That's a myth. He didn't lose a lot of weight because of steroid use or whatever the fuck you're trying to say (you need help on sentence structure because you make no sense sometimes), he lost weight because of all the things in his DIET he cut out. He was trying to be quicker and lighter on his feet, as he has said many times, and at the beginning of the season didn't feel like himself, as he has said many times, so he switched back to his old meal plan and workout routine to start gaining weight back. Thus, all the back and knee problems coming out of nowhere because he was doing what he usually does in the summer, during the season. Therefore, he took a 2 week break to heal from his injuries and came back fresh. 

Ignorant people who assume the only way an athlete can be good at something is by using steroids or performance enhancers just really suck. It's possible, believe it or not, that you can realize your full potential by eating right, taking care of your body, and working hard. I know, foreign thought right? </TEXT>
