	<TEXT> I know the preview video I saw recently mentioned adding animations for eating, etc... but I'll be honest, I don't think it 'needs' those things anytime soon. I mean, I don't feel like I'm missing anything because I can't see me scrape out the inside of the dog food can with my fingers, a'la Mad Max, not that it wouldn't be cool. But I also kind of feel like that's what it would take, an animation for each type of food. And honestly, I'd much rather see more crafting or building type options (maybe the ability to gather wood for lean-to's or temporary shelters, or something like that) than I would see me lower myself to demolishing the last few bites of dog food. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Drop your classes except for welding. Get your certs. Go make 100 grand a year and take a few years to figure out what you want to do in life. I blew my full-ride on weed way back when I was in college, like, literally, spent all the money on marijuana, and that was in 1998, so that was a lot of weed. Got into it with my dad, my mom, my friends, pretty much anyone who asked what I was going to do with my life and why didn't I give a fuck about being a fuck up. So I said fuck it, dropped out, got my welding certs (just GMAW a first), got one of the gazillion welding jobs out there where you go to work, put your helmet on, lay a bead all day and never really have to interact with anyone if you don't want to. Hid from everyone for a few years and when I surfaced I felt good finally. I felt good about me, despite anyone's views of who I was supposed to be or what I was supposed to do. 

If you want, I work in Fremont now and live in Marin, if your near either of those places PM and I'll buy you a coffee and you can hang out and vent some. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> The Long Dark (My thoughts so far) </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-06-17 18:24:00 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I know there's a big Long Dark forum since it's been around on Steam for a while now, but here's a quick post on my impressions so far, as well as a few tips that I've found out in my playtime. 

Firstly, I'm totally digging this game. I downloaded it and the Elite Dangerous trials both at the same time, liked them both, bought the full versions, but haven't stopped playing this long enough to get any Elite time in, other than an hour or so. I'm usually not much of a survival-genre player, but I got a little hooked after only lasting 8 hours my first game and then figuring out ways to slowly get that number a little higher. I've played a dozen or so games now and on my current save game I've been alive for 12 and a half days. I've got two well stocked shelters (the Camp Office and the Trappers Cabin) and am beginning to explore the area. Overall, if you're into survival and crafting type games, you'll probably like this, and even if youre not, you should at least give the trial a shot, you may be surprised. 

A few tips I've picked up, remember, almost like real-life, there's some priorities to your survival. Your number one priority should be shelter. Without shelter you'll freeze to death. No matter where you spawn you're never more than 30 minutes or so from a cabin, but if you haven't got the lay of the land yet (I recommend not looking at the abundance of maps available online, it sorta takes some fun out of it) any shelter will do. If it has an inside, but no stove for a fire than it's probably not great (I'm looking at you Logging Camp and you Lake Cabins). Stoves make starting fires easier, and are a requirement if you want to have a fire inside.  So, first and foremost, find a not-breezy spot to start a fire. Forage for a little wood (an hour or two long fire from a few pieces of softwood is fine for now) and get that fire going. Melt some snow and boil it for some safe drinking water. I think Im averaging a liter of water a day or so. Then food. Food is last, always. You can go a day and a half without eating a thing while exploring if youre not injured. In fact, if youre rationing, you can make a few candy bars and sodas last 3 or 4 days. If youre low on food, only eat when you run out of calories. And speaking of running, stop, unless you have a good food source. It burns calories and risks sprained ankles and falls. And falling will hurt and tear up your jeans, and well, without jeans, yeah, youre gonna die. Also, running around can easily attract a wolf that you might have been able to avoid, and if you get attacked by a wolf, yeah, youre gonna die. And lets not mention that bear that hangs out by the Lonely Pond, because a tussle with him, and yeah, you guessed it, youre gonna die. The only time running is a must is if you see a wolf chasing a deer and have something to scare the wolf off with (Flare, Gun, etc) Than run in their direction, the wolf will eventually catch the deer and then you can steal his kill and harvest without a tool, which is impossible to do with the frozen deer corpses you find.

I wont give away any of the stashs locations that Ive found, but I will say when you find Mystery Lake, take your time and fully explore it. Setting up a base at the Camp Office and getting into a forage for wood, get some food, explore, rest cycle will go really far for you. Dont venture too far until youve checked out all the little nooks and crannys around the lake, theres good stuff all over. 

I will say one thing Im concerned about is how often this game will see updates. I can tell pretty quickly that now that I have a stable food supply and two well stocked places to crash with plenty of fire-starting abilities that I will eventually run out of stuff to find and explore. Im hoping by then that one of the other areas opens up, because if not, this game could get pretty boring pretty quickly.

	<TEXT> This game is awesome and I've been waiting for something like this on Xbox. Its really great looking, sounds good, and plays fantastic. There's still small bugs to work out, namely for some reason their message parser doesn't read your button mappings correctly, but overall, this game is fantastic. I think I'm totally going to start up a small mining company off in the outer systems and just, relax, go to work every day, and earn an honest living. </TEXT>

The lexan is ordered for the front and the marquee and I'm still playing around with ideas for marquee art. I also have a lexan lower for the control panel that wraps around the bottom of the panel and hides the wiring, etc... I'm thinking of doing the entire first level of Metal Slug as the background for inside that lower wrap. </TEXT>

But you do realize that the reason they issued it wasn't because it was going to be hot. It was because it's going to be hot after weeks of cooler than normal weather. They just had a report published that said that May was cooler than any other month so far in 2015. So yeah, when the temperature spikes in such a short period, they put it out there so people can keep on eye on their pets or the little old lady that lives next door that doesn't have air conditioning. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've learned to gauge how serious it is from the initial cry, to the actual scream. My daughter does a short cry (less than a second) than the quiet, mouth open, scream, until she runs out of breath, than the real crying starts. The longer that time spent holding her breath with the silent scream mouth thing going, the worse it is.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Right, it's insane. As motorcyclists who travel between traffic in California we deal with a greater number of individuals per day than almost any other commuter out there. This means our chances of dealing with one of those insane people goes up. Which means you either accept that the person you're telling to get off the fucking phone is insane and might take your valuable advice the wrong way, or you swallow it and move on with your life. The choice is yours, just know that this crazy motherfucker, and other's like him are out there on the road. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Body position. Body position. Body position. You fell because you had hard parts touch the ground because you were sitting in the middle of the seat and pushing the bike down below you. If you want to keep riding like an idiot on the street, you should do two things. One, pony up for a track day. They're not that expensive and the things you will learn in a few hours on the track will make you so much more successful on the street. Two, get off the bike some more. The further you move your center of gravity towards the inside of the turn, the less steep your lean angle needs to be, thus keeping the hard parts of your motorcycle off the ground. Move your outside buttcheek to the inside part of the seat, put your head wear the inside mirror is, imagine that you're trying to kiss your reflection. 

And to make the point for the thousandth time, not that you'll listen, stop riding at 10/10ths on the street (this video was obviously more like 11 or 12/10ths considering the outcome). Proper riding technique can bring joyful riding even when you're only pushing it to 7 or 8/10ths of your ability, and it leaves room to correct for sand i nthe road, idiot drivers, etc... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My daughter was almost a year old when I switched jobs. Between the jobs I took a month off (thanks California bonding pay) and stayed home with my daughter. Going into that month I felt like you. Coming out of that month I was ready to have another baby. 

It get's better. Sometimes it's little things that light the way, sometimes it's one moment when they look at you and smile and say Dada. This last week, my now two-year old daughter was down in Florida visiting Grandma and I had to stay back home to work. Wednesday night I talked to her on the phone just before bedtime and she said, "Miss you dada," and it literally brought tears to my eyes. Something I never would have considered happening a year and a half ago. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Right, sorry, that's the point I was trying to make but not sure if it came across clear or not. Max has spent a lifetime in the Wasteland and it's likely (seeing as how deep down he's a kind soul that want's to help despite his built in need to survive) that there have been many people whom he wished he could have saved but couldn't. Maybe some were women he fell in love with, although I doubt that since I couldn't ever really see him getting over his wife. I mean, his nod to Furiosa at the end says it all. You're safe, I'm going back to the Wasteland to go back to surviving. But yes, overall I agree, I don't think the imagery of the child(ren) should be taken literally nor do they affect the canon of the original. Sprog was a boy, that didn't change, just getting others' opinion on it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Most are probably going to say **Fury Road** and while it was definitely one of the most intense, exciting, and action-packed films that I saw this week, I think **Ex-Machina** gets my vote for best move this week. Well thought out, moving, socially and culturally relevant to today's world (not the Max wasn't, just harder to see through all the action). It is also the one that left me wondering what happens next and postulating theories about the events following the film while Max just made me think about what happened between the films.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was also trying to do the math in my head last night after watching it. You're right, at first it seems like a leap of faith to believe that all four movies fit onto the same timeline. However, think about it this way, because I think it's possible. If the crisis had started when Max was a child (the bombs dropped, etc...) but he was fortunate enough to grow up in one of the last 'safe' zones than it works. Max and Furiosa could be the same age. Joe had been going about building his society in the wastelands since Max was a child. I think that things were bad in the Wasteland during the events of Mad Max, but there were still 'safe' areas like the city that Max grew up in and wanted to try to protect. At the end he realized that he was no longer a protector and just one of 'them' and goes off to the Wasteland. That's why at the end of Road Warrior, the people of the refinery still have places to escape to. Places that only loads and loads of fuel can get you to. By the time Thunderdome rolls around the world has fallen apart. Even the safe places are deteriorating, and the Wasteland gangs are already developing into complex societies with 'laws'. I think if you put Max at 25 at the end of Mad Max and than add 5-6 years between movies, it works. But only if you believe that Mad Max is happening after the fall, not before (as some people claim). </TEXT>
