	<TEXT> Really? It makes me glad that when women have a pregnancy they can't afford, they have options besides knitting needles and infanticide.

Infanticide was appallingly common throughout history, of course. I'll take abortion any day of the week over infanticide. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  How often women with children regret having children.

Do you know, I actually know multiple people whose parents have told them one of the following:

1. They regret having children.
2. They regret having had children when they did, and if they could do it all over again they'd abort the first child(ren) and only have the later one(s).
3. They regret having as many children as they did, and if they could do it all over again they'd abort the last child(ren) and only have the first one(s).

These parents weren't all abusive assholes either, who might be expected to say *anything*. Some of them, as near as I can tell, are good parents... who, in retrospect, realize they screwed up and really regret their reproductive choices. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It does not show that it increases the chance. It shows that there is a correlation between those who are circumcised and those who are autistic. (Or at least I assume it does. I haven't read the article.) It does not show causation, however - it is possible (probable, really) that in Denmark, circumcision is only common in one or two minority ethnic groups. It is possible that those groups are simply more prone to autism already. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Then you'll grow out of it in a short time. Sometimes children do go through phases, yes. It doesn't harm them to go along with it, though.

Puberty blockers are started at the age of puberty, or during precocious puberty. A ten or twelve year old is probably no longer going through silly phases where they would like to be a "butterfly" when grown. If they've been saying for years that they are really a girl (or boy), they probably know whereof they speak.

In between birth and puberty, if your child-with-a-penis wants to wear a dress, it doesn't harm that child to let them do it. And if your child-with-a-vagina wants to be called "Tom", again, it doesn't harm them to just go along with this. If it's a phase, they'll ask you to stop sooner or later. If it's not, they won't. Either way, they'll remember their childhood as being filled with love and acceptance.

Children never, ever, ever forget how you made them feel. </TEXT>

They do know what gender they are. It's the other people around them who sometimes don't.

 I don't think it's unreasonable to hold off on labeling a kid that young.

Nobody minds labeling babies as girls or boys, and we've found that when children say they're a girl or boy, they usually don't change their minds at adulthood.

See, this isn't something where we need to debate it out. We already have the facts. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There aren't terribly many out transgender individuals in the world to date, so it's normal for people not to understand. 

What I have found, through the advantage of being a few years older than you :) and also through happening to fall into the neurodiversity movement as a young woman is that it doesn't really matter if I understand another person's self-identification or not. All I have to grasp is that it is important to *them*, however strange it might seem to me. If I start with that attitude, I usually come to understand whatever-it-is over time, and without the stress. (I also ended up gathering a rather diverse set of friends this way. So much more interesting than only having friends who are like me!)

But if you're interested in the subject, googling "transgender 101" will get you a variety of links on the subject. Some are a little more adamant (http://www.tranarchism.com/2010/11/26/not-your-moms-trans-101/) and some are a little more easy-going (http://www.transpeoplespeak.org/trans-101/).  </TEXT>

ALL preschoolers who are developing normally understand what gender they are. Sometimes other people don't understand *them*, but this is normal behavior for children.

And some of those kids will attempt to self-mutilate to get their bodies to look like they want. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes, there is "such a thing as a transgender girl". Most children know whether they are boys or girls in preschool, hence, most transgender children know they are boys or girls in preschool - whether or not other people think their genitals match. 

And it can be frightening. It's not uncommon to hear of transgender girls trying to cut off their penises, for example.

Yes, this is possible without "significant environmental factors". This happens in accepting families where a child who says they are a boy (or girl) is allowed to use their chosen name and wear clothes of that gender, and this happens in non-accepting families where those children are told they're sinful and wrong.

Gender identity has no connection to sexual orientation. It has nothing to do with "being gay". Your sexual orientation is who you want to sleep with or date. Your gender identity is who you are. Your sex is (roughly) what's between your legs. </TEXT>

And no, one does not perform surgery or give hormone treatment to minors. At most, minors use hormone blockers between puberty and adulthood. If they go off the hormone blockers - a drug we've used safely for years to treat precocious puberty - they simply enter puberty as normal.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Giving your boy a girls name and telling them they are a girl their whole adolescent life seems psychologically dangerous. 

You're right. Telling a child who insists she is a girl that she is REALLY a boy just because of how her body looks IS psychologically dangerous. Children whose self-identification is not accepted run a high risk of depression, self-harm, and even suicide - even when they're quite young.

This is not my ignorant supposition. That's why the accepted treatment for gender dysphoria is transition, because transition is the treatment associated with a reduction in depression, self-harm, and suicide. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, hormone blockers are not the same as hormone therapy. If you stop taking the blockers, you enter puberty just like normal.

Also: Don't link to the Daily Fail, please. Whenever you're tempted to do so, just remind yourself that that's the paper *Vernon Dursley* reads. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  If it were genetics then we would see identical twins undergoing the same experience with gender dysphoria. 

Not necessarily. For example, we know that schizophrenia is highly heritable, but having an identical twin with schizophrenia only gives you a 50% chance of developing it yourself.

Additionally, many conditions are congenital that are not genetic in nature. We know that fraternal twins where one is female-bodied and one is male-bodied are more likely to have at least one twin be transgender than singletons, probably due to hormones in utero. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Young children are NOT put on hormones. However, many are put on hormone blockers - a treatment which has been used for decades in treating early puberty, and which is accepted as safe - until majority. At that time, if they change their mind, they can simply go off the blockers and puberty will begin as normal.

Alternatively, they can start hormones as adults, and the transition will  be easier and their appearance will more correctly look like other men/women because they won't have gone through the "wrong" puberty. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They're not too young. ALL children develop their gender identity in preschool.

If a child with a penis is not "too young" to determine that they are a boy, and a child with a vulva is not "too young" to determine that they are a girl, then the converse is true as well.

"I'm willing to bet money less than half would transition after puberty and they would all live happy lives."

You would lose that bet. People who have more education than you have spent years, even decades studying the subject. Lack of acceptance is associated with depression and self-harm - even in small children. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, they don't conclude they're transgender. (That's the accepted term, by the way.) They conclude that they're a girl or a boy. 

When you were small, before you knew that people's genitals differed, how did you know you were a girl or a boy? You knew you wanted to act like grown ups of your gender, and you wanted to fit in with other children of your gender, and that you didn't want to do things that were associated with the OTHER gender.

That's all. It's the same for transgender children. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  And honestly how many transgender kids are there?

Transgender individuals (based on self-reporting) appear to comprise about .5% of the population. If we assume troop sizes of about 10 girls each, and that transgender girls are as likely to join girl scouts as not, then that's 1 in 20 troops having to deal with this.

However, it can actually be dangerous to identify as transgender, and there's a distinct lack of understanding and awareness around this issue. We're reasonably certain that our numbers are lower than reality, because many transgender individuals won't admit it, even on an anonymous survey. (And the situation gets more complicated with children, as their parents have to accept it for the kid to get anywhere with that.) So we don't really know how many transgender kids there are, nor how many might take advantage of this policy. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's not "ludicrous". Most children know what gender they are in preschool. We only call it strange when what they know doesn't seem to match up with their external genitalia.

Denying a child's stated gender identity carries a real risk of depression and self-harm - even for very young children. And it's much harder to transition as an adult if you've already gone through puberty as the wrong gender. (Puberty blockers are plenty safe. We've used them for decades to treat precocious puberty. All they do is they prevent puberty. If, upon reaching adulthood, the individual decides NOT to take hormones to transition, they simply go off the blockers and enter puberty in the usual way.) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts of America are not affiliated in any way, shape, or form.

The Boy Scouts tends towards the right - hence their ban of gay members until very recently, their ongoing ban of atheists, etc.

The Girl Scouts tends towards the left - they don't care about the religious affiliation (or lack thereof) of their members, they've been fairly LGBT positive for a few decades, and so on.

More liberal families who want their boys in scouting programs go for groups like Campfire USA or Spiral Scouts, however, none of these have anything like the numbers of Boy Scouts so some just hold their nose and join Boy Scouts anyway. And Conservative Christian families who want their girls in scouting programs join American Heritage Girls or Royal Rangers, both of which seem to also have male analogs. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Your sex is, roughly, what's between your legs.

Your gender is whether you feel like a girl or a boy.

Most children know what gender they are in preschool. And for most children, it matches up neatly - children with a penis and testicles know they are male, children with vulvas and vaginas know they are female. Nobody questions this, until it goes the other way and a child with a penis knows she's a female or a child with a vulva knows he's male. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Your gender identity isn't a decision. 

Call up your parents. Ask them when you started saying you were a girl (or a boy) and saying things like "Girls do this" or "I don't want to wear those, those are for boys (girls)". 

Unless you were highly unusual, this was in preschool.

That's a normal developmental timetable for ALL children.

When you tell children that what they know about themselves is false, you run a high risk of depression and self-harm - even in preschoolers. Whatever you might like to think on the subject, it's not too much for the attitude you espouse to hurt children. </TEXT>
