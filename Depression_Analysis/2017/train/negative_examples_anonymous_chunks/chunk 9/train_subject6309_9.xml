	<TEXT> Hey fellow teachers,
In August I will be teaching at a new school(7-12). The current Language Arts teacher is very, very into ECAR(every child a reader) and ECAW(every child a writer). I have done a little research into this program, and it seems to be geared towards elementary age kids, not middle school(what I teach). I am very hesitant to adopt this new teaching program. Any thoughts out there? Are there benefits?  </TEXT>
