	<TEXT> I never said bomb them. I'm talking about an intervention coordinated by the international community (NATO by example), not just the US. 
We've seen that their method does not work, however, it's getting pretty obvious that something has to be done because the situation over there is getting out of hand, human rights being violated left and right.. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No matter how gruesome, this should be everywhere. People have to know what's going on and realise that just watching it happen is not the way to act.

Fuck Russia and China btw, preventing the entire international community to intervene with political and economical pressure. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> How on earth can you call players like Wickd, krepo, snoopeh and yellowpete 'trash'? Yes, they have their bad games, everyone does.
I personally have seen lots of improvement troughout the last season and they ended 4th in the LCS. Trash? Gl in your series to bronze 2 or whatever it is you play in
