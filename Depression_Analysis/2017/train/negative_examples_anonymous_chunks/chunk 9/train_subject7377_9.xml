But the other day I stupidly took a small car on a dirt road after rain,  it was SO slippery, I got bogged twice,  I was no where near any houses and had no phone signal. My heart rate got up to 115. It was pretty scary,  doesn't compare to these other stories though.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I live in a rural areas a know many farmers, there are some who view kangaroos as pests and put up fences and shoot them.  And there are some that don't think of them as pests and don't even have fences and definitely don't shoot them and have no problems with crop damage.  

These people are from the same area,  they very likely have the same numbers of kangaroos on their properties. The 'pest' label is largely based on opinion from what I can tell.  

Edit: there are no reliable studies to show that kangaroos are pests.  </TEXT>

A lady i know who has kangaroos found a joey on the ground right after it was born,  she popped it in the pouch and it survived but I'd assume there are plenty that aren't so lucky. 

Edit to add : the joey this lady found had the cord wrapped around its hands so it wasn't able to grip the fur.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi all, 

I'm just wondering it there are any other teachers/pre-service teachers here with anxiety? I am starting my first week of placement next week and am getting pretty bad anxiety thinking about it. It's something completely new for me and I don't know how to deal with it. 

I will be working in a kindy (pre-school) with kids aged 3-4, a good age I think, which will make things easier, but I'm still worried. 

any advice or stories from others in this situation would be very much appreciated! thank you </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's hard, a lot of people are instantly turned off certain issues because of bad advocates. Like feminism being ruined by feminazis and now so many people just don't take it seriously anymore and its probably impossible to change their minds. 

I think that just going about it gently and patiently. Do what you can and be proud of that.  Its good to be passionate and want to make a difference.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Don't be rude or judgemental. 

Don't say your opinion is the right one or the best one. 

Talk about stuff in casual and friendly conversation or polite debate. 

Don't take every opportunity you get to advocate for whatever it is,  or people will get annoyed/ bored with it. 

Bring it up in appropriate places and at appropriate times.

Be understanding of why others don't feel the same as you. 

Don't be forceful.

Be honest.  </TEXT>
