	<TEXT> They're probably trying to balance it out, because once you slapped it on you were a tank who died to nothing. Also people have theorized that you could have an airdrop, drop you your power armor for when the situation calls for it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'd recommend finishing NV and then moving on to FO3, this way you can take the extra time to read notes, look at the little nifty details and take it all in, before moving onto FO3. FO4 doesn't come out for another few months so don't bother rushing, take your time with each and enjoy every little detail you can. </TEXT>
