The same way a thousand years ago nobody could have understood what gravity was, today there's still some lack in our fundamentals of science which cannot explain everything. Which is why we're drawing all these crazy conclusions; because the extrapolations rely on the wrong assumptions. We actually really don't know anything yet. </TEXT>

It's like a newspaper headline for the parts of Reddit that 80% of users don't know about; more about raising awareness to a larger subset of users than "oooh shiny!". Judging by the response the other day to anything mildly resembling /u/chooter (did you see the documentary about Queen Victoria? that was great), I'd say it definitely deserves a place here.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's important to realize that these "people" are just the same as us. They're not any different from us; they have the same fears, worries, etc. The distinction lies in the societal framework which differentiates the "haves" with the "have nots". Their destructive acts are just means to align themselves with society's rules, not sincere malice. Society's rules for them dictate that they "should" be offensive, where in actual fact they're really just hiding who they really are inside. Hence two people who are alike in almost every way can be divided into two camps which society determines. The enemy isn't "those people", it's the framework of society itself. When you find friends who don't rely on this framework as their identity and can stand on their own, you'll find that there's very little difference between the introverts and extroverts.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If it helps, I used to be the awkward quiet skinny guy in school as well. Now I get girls checking me out in public, even though I look exactly the same. You need to learn who you really are and find your own confidence in your identity, that's what will help you turn the ship around. 

Let me let you in on a little secret. All those popular handsome people who are treating you like shit? They're doing that because they're just as insecure as you are. I only realized that after I spent years improving myself to be just as good as them, only to reconnect with them and realize I had surpassed them by such a wide margin, because they were never better than me on the first place. Seriously, none of them are any better than you. I'm not saying this as motivation, it's fact.  

PM me if you wanna talk.

	<TEXT> As a devout Christian, I think people need to realize something. The people who can't handle hard questioning, or end up getting frustrated, are really doing it for themselves. I'm not saying their intentions are insincere, just that they identify with it as an extension of their person, rather than actually enjoying God. 

It's the same in any other setting, e.g. science - the ones who make the most noise do so because they are trying to reinforce something which "belongs" to them, be it a belief, a position or status, etc; not because they actually understand that the calculations for the origins of the big bang rely on two primary axioms (that the speed of light is constant in all frames of reference and that there is nothing faster than the speed of light). Whereas the real scientists or missionaries just keep quiet and are okay with acknowledging things they sincerely don't fully understand. They maintain their position, but they keep quiet. 

The loud ones are the ones who can't handle the current circumstances and desperately seek to affect a change to "restore" the environment to how they feel it should be, because they see the circumstances as an extension of themselves. If you truly were seeking the truth (be it in science or God) and not care for the self, you wouldn't bother with the social cost that comes with making enemies for little tangible benefit. It's not like you're actually going to effect any real change, i.e. change someone's mind.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> thanks for the insight. however, I don't think that's correct, as KO famously had an extremely high P/E when Buffett first looked at it. This article says it was a P/E of around 25-30: https://www.quora.com/What-was-the-P-E-Buffett-paid-for-Coca-Cola. So I don't know where he got the 59/100 figure from, which implies a P/E of less than 2. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Can someone shed some light on this quote I found here? 
http://studentofvalue.com/deliberate-practice-2-coca-cola-1988/

In 1989 there was strong evidence (in the 10-k) of increasing returns on investment AND growth AND the share price was at the equivalent of $10. **The annual return on every additional dollar invested by Coke was 59 cents**, far above its ROIC of 22%. Those circumstances represent obvious value. Obvious to anyone who cared to look and cared to think even a little about it.

In 2012, theres 9% return on every dollar of new investment, far below the ROIC of 72.8%. It can grow all it likes at 9% returns and it wont create a dime of value Besides, the shares are now not at $10 but at $79 .

What does "annual return on every additional dollar invested by Coke was 59 cents" mean? It's not P/E, nor is it ROA, as calculated in this other article: http://www.gurufocus.com/news/205476/revisiting-buffett--cocacola-in-1988

*I suppose he's referring to earnings per dollar of retained earnings, but even that's not right*. Anybody can shed some light on what the 59 cents he's referring to is? 

I couldn't find the 1989 KO financial statements, but I did find the 1988 ones which shouldn't have differed by much: https://www.scribd.com/doc/34149986/KO-1988 </TEXT>
