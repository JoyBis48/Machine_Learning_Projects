	<TEXT> Moon landing? Please, at this point in technology we can clearly see that the moon is a hologram and that is obviously an overlay to cover an ancient satellite set in place by the Reptoids before they went into slumber. If you were to call it anything it was a docking mission to explore and attempt to reactive the satellites defensive / offensive capabilities...

As for that explosion... Yes it was an explosion, but it was not directed at the members of Parliament. He knows this, he's part of the very Reptoid collaborating society that set the plan in motion, you can tell by his general demeanor that he and the rest are in no danger and that it's all going as planned. 

The truth is that the explosive was planted in a large underground chamber located underneath Parliament in an obvious attempt to disturb / awaken the Reptoids from their slumber. 

The end game is to find the Reptoids with the knowledge to reactivate the satellite, so far no nation has been able to do so and the Reptoids they have awoken are starting to acclimate themselves into the world which we created... They have since worked their way into all positions of power and have been the ones behind all the conflicts in recent times... 

Now, my theory is that soon they will have no need for their worshipers like the politician in this video, soon they will be able to reactivate the satellite not for it's offensive or defensive capabilities like us mere humans want... They want it in order to send out a sub space transmission to recall their lost fleets in deep space.  </TEXT>

Finish work and start playing something on the train, get home throw it on the dock, pick up the DS3 and BAM! Straight back into the same game on your tv...

Heading back out? Pick it up off the dock, throw it in your pocket and away you go, when ready you carry on where you left off.


The standby / snapshot and tv out dock features were amazing.


This is what I thought the Vita would also do... But they fucked up major in that regard. </TEXT>

Over here, If I were your situation I would just go to a pharmacy... pay like $5 (generic) or $15 (brand)for  a new inhaler.

If it were ever bad enough of an a attack that I wind up in hospital... After I recover I just walk out without having to pay a cent.

	<TEXT> If you're actually interested in a discussion it really is a matter of you get what you pay for when it comes to projectors and depends on how much your willing to spend, If you spend $3500 or more you'll be fine really.

Anything less... $500 - $1500 Well, it'll work sure, but you'll encounter issues as you've mentioned, washed out colours, blurred or distorted image if the projector isn't perfectly aligned, Issues focusing the lens etc.

Keep in mind anything around the $3500 mark is still considered an entry level home theater projector. Not without their faults sure, but you'd be hard pressed to find any real issues other than black levels, which are always an issue with projectors but can be mitigated with the correct screen type and colour to suit your projector and room lighting conditions.

If you just want a big screen and dont care about quality, get a cheap $500 - $1500 projector, use a sheet for a screen and set it up where ever you can.

Or spend a bit more money, buy a better projector along with a proper screen and set up a dedicated room for a home theater. 

But if you were just making a negative comment... Then eh, leave it at that. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> After re-watching the Pokemon series I have come to the conclusion that all the Pokemon games are not real events and are Games/simulations created by the Pokmon Technical Institute in the Pokemon Animated Universe itself.

In the episode: Se01-Ep09 - The School of Hard Knocks. The Students refer to Pokemons Lvls, experience, and when/how they will evolve based on this information, same as the game. 
As far as I remember they never mention Pokemon in this manner ever again except in the games themselves.

The episode then shows the Pokemon Battle Simulator, which is an almost exact replica of the actual Pokemon games battle system.

So my theory is that in the Pokemon Animated Universe the Pokemon Technical Institute created the games based on their research to help up and coming trainers and teach them about pokemon as well as threats in their world. (Team Rocket etc)

This is also supported by the 4th wall comments in some of the games from the Dev team. such as:
"I'm the game designer!"
"I wrote the story!"
"I'm the graphic artist! I drew you!" or "I'm the graphic designer! I'm a skilled dot artist!"
"Me? I'm the programmer!".

Also of note is that in some versions of the Pokemon Games there are NPCs playing Pokemon on a handheld device, meaning in the Pokemon Game Universe the Pokemon Games exist and is aware that it is indeed a game.

None of it is real, it's all a game within the Pokemon Animated Universe itself.

Or something... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Eh the production / cultivation of Soy for your tofu has killed many... From insecticides and pesticides to crop harvesters. 

Birds, rabbits, rats, mice and more are all victims of large scale Soy bean farming practices.

Same with any farm though.

Oh and rats / mice have been shown to be  intelligent, empathetic and social animals...

Wont eat meat beacuse its murder? Enjoy your death bean byproduct. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Nah back then people complained all the same, only difference is they had to write an actual letter and send it via post to the networks etc... Have you ever been so upset or offended you'd take time out of your day to do that? Hand write a letter then leave your house to go post it? That's commitment to your cause son.

These days any moron can jump online and complain via email, or facebook, twitter, forums etc.

TL;DR

People bitched then as much as now, it just took more effort to be heard. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Once a year in Melbourne Australia there is whats known as Hard Rubbish Collection / Verge side collection, where everyone takes what they dont want and throws it out the front of their house to be collected by the local council...

And I tell ya what man, you can get some really good stuff if you pick the right suburbs.

People throw out stuff like large flat screen TV's because they have a damaged power cable or a scratch in the corner of the screen.. Computers, Consoles, CD collections, Bicycles, Washers, Dryers, Desks, Tables, Couches...

People are known to take vans / pickups around to go scouting for good loot.. So you have to get in early. Theres also people who go around cutting all the cables off electronics for the scrap copper... bastards really.

You can damn near re-furnish you house if you're lucky enough. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Checked his post history, he's posting them all to:

[Colour the Past - Downunder](https://www.facebook.com/colourthepast)

So he's either asking for them for the sake of doing it or he's building a portfolio of other peoples work in hopes of starting a restoration / colourization business and using reddit as his workforce.

I hope it's the former and he simply wants AUS/NZ to live on in colour. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Awesome, with The Lion King one you can pretty much follow the movie / know what scenes are what based on the colour:

Light green is the Savanna

Yellow is pride rock / gorge

Purple is the Elephant graveyard

Blue are the nighttime scenes

Variations of Green is jungle

And of course the Orange and Red at the end there is the climatic ending with Pride Rock on fire...

The others.. never really watched them as much as the Lion King so I found them harder to follow like this. </TEXT>
