	<TEXT> [Overflow from Tahoe into the Truckee river.](http://www.truckeeriverkeepers.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Truckee-Tahoe-boca-900x600.jpg) Normally it is up around those tree banks.

Probably want to get out there soon. The two tributary rivers behind my house that feed Tahoe should be about 4ft deep right now. They are about a foot deep at most. That much because we got some rain this month.

	<TEXT> The overflow from Lake Tahoe into the Truckee river- which feeds tributaries to this- hasn't been flowing for a year and a half - Tahoes water level is too low. Add 0 (zero) snowpack this season and Nevada is cooked.

Such a shame - this area of the sierra foothills was so beautiful. I wonder how the tribes are handling it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What are they planted near? Don't plant peppers near fennel or kohlrabi.

I  would dig a little natural compost in around, make sure they have good drainage and just give them some time. You might want to try a little epsom salts (half teaspoon per gallon of warm water) and water them once a week for a couple weeks with that. 

Be careful with nitrogenous fertilizers though. If you over fertilize peppers with nitrogen they will get lush leaves and no fruit. You might want to try a dry vegetable mix fertilizer at half recommended dosage. Make sure to get a fertilizer with usable iron and sulfur. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I started noticing an anti-female 'anti-feminist' astroturfing campaign about 8 months ago. I'm in marketing. 

So about 2 months ago an old colleague contacted me about references. I asked him what he had been doing and he said he had been doing PR postings for the Republican party under a media group contract. I asked him why he left and he said it was because it had been turned into a *'Woman hatred, feminist hatred, made up stories fest 24/7"* in "prepping" for a Hillary run. He said they were even posting as rabid, crazy people claiming to be 'feminists' to make them look bad.

He quit when met someone and fell in love, and realized that he was posting, ultimately, about her, and his mother, and his sisters. 

A lot of people fall for slick 'advertising' - even redditors. Usually a clue is when all of a sudden you notice a clear trend popping up.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Economic, social and technological.

Warning: long.

People pretty much stayed in the same places. My great grandmothers home was built by her father in 1920. She lived there until a few weeks before she died in 1983- when my grandmother cared for her in the house *they* bought in 1958. 

There were long term familial and neighborly support structures in place. People knew each other, and helped each other. The routine in the evenings was to go sit on the porch after supper and people who were out walking would stop and visit, and tell stories and talk politics or whatever. If you had a big porch like my great gran you had a few pitchers of cold tea ready. Same people, same faces, going back to the depression/war era.

Part of the reason for porch sitting or taking walks was to see people, part of the reason was AC wasn't common back then and it was nice to cool off in the evenings outside.

The generation of people older than me by 8-10 years; when they graduated college and got jobs, companies started moving people across the country. That was the beginning of the breakdown of the support system.

When I graduated HS I worked at a local pet shop for a few months, then got my own place. A very nice little rental that was comfortably paid for with one weeks check. There were no 'credit checks' back then- it was inconceivable that you could not afford a place to live with even the humblest of jobs. I was able to go to college part time and save back for the downpayment on my first house.

In the 2000's, when an artificial economy was built on the housing 'market' - driven by higher and higher property values (how are you going to *grow* an economy on stable values?) suddenly people couldn't afford to purchase homes, hell they could barely afford rent.

This also means that people move around a lot. More social breakdown, combined with technology that keeps people entertained in their artificial environments. And people having to work more than one job at a time that leaves little room for socializing with neighbors struggling to do the same.

 And here we are today. 

When I see pictures or google maps pics of European cities in which there are a lot of folks out and about, socializing, I know they are doing well. It's a thumbstick measure I have internalized. </TEXT>

But about epics, I'll put it like this: 

What if you were Indiana Jones and went on an adventure, endured some grueling moments, challenged fate, monsters, your skills and the elements and finally emerged victorious with a glorious, magical ring.

So you go back to town ... and half the people are walking around with the same ring, having barely done a thing to achieve it.

First off, there is definitely not the same sense of achievement and pleasure for the people who didn't leave town or even break a sweat to get the ring. The excitement and joy would be diminished. Ho hum, just another bit of gear.

Secondly, Indy would just be like.. fuuck. </TEXT>

We paid 20% more and waited 14+ months for an expansion that removed more playable / fun content from the game than it has added:

1. Flying

2. Reforging + Item Upgrades

3. Scenarios

4. Character Abilities

5. Valor/Justice Points

6. Daily quest hubs

7. 10 Heroic ('Mythic') Raiding

8. Guild levelling/perks

9. Repeatable rare mobs

10. Gathering professions for over half a year and counting

11. All old school unique professions scrapped in all future 'content'.

12. Decent ilvl gear from world bosses (650?)

13. Previous expansions' content scrapped: MoP legendary questline, Garrosh heirlooms, Isle of Thunder solo scenarios, MoP challenge mode content, old raid item drop nerfs

14. "Promised"/Delayed content:

Farahlon

Karabor/BladespireIron Docks quest hub

Tanaan Jungle

Trial of the Gladiator

Battle Pet Breeding/Epic Pets

Multiple garrison features: the ability to put your garrison is various locations, renaming your epic followers, garrison Trophies for killing rares/elite mobs in Draenor, Building Garrison Defences, Diablo 3-style transmog system 

------------------------------------

 Not sure how anyone can reconcile this. Never in the history of WoW have so many features been removed or scrapped. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The hunter dead zone is impossible in several encounters in dungeons or raids. But if we got our unique pet abilities back and were allowed to melee and dual wield again, it would be fun in pvp. 

I played with that 'dead zone' for a long time on my hunter. It just can't be done without bringing the other elements back, including proper traps instead of the bullshit we have now. 

Edit: about my first sentence there. Here is an example: The [End Time in Cata](http://i.ytimg.com/vi/ugSVZK-k4PM/maxresdefault.jpg). You had to be within the circle of lights on the encounters, remember? If you were within those- as you needed to be - you were too close range to shoot the boss.  If you stepped back to where you were at closest range to shoot- you were outside the light and only did about 10% to 20% damage. 

It was like an Anti Hunter encounter.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I absolutely agree with everything you said. Not only have they made classes homogenous- they did the same thing with hunter pets.

One of the Fun things about having a hunter was going out and getting elusive pets that had unique abilities (like horn toss for rhinos or snatch (disarm) for birds etc). These abilities were then useful for different encounters, battlegrounds, enemies, etc. It was part of being a well-rounded hunter. 

Now all the pets are just buff machines for the raid.  

Give me those pet abilities back- plus the hunter melee abilities we used to be able to use, including dual wielding for close encounters (I still have my Edge of Chaos and Sundered Bone axe in the bank) and full-on aggressive mode for pets- and I will gladly give up my several yards.

I used to love parking my cat at flags - on aggressive and prowl (stealthed with burst damage coming out) and watch it pop out -stunning the crap out of the would-be flag stealer and wrecking them while I threw traps and arcane shot. Yea, I'll give up my close up yards for that. But I don't think you would like it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm hostile about it because it's the first time since I started playing that - for any toon - the ability imbalance forced me to play a spec I never wanted to play. It lost the element of fun. Same thing that many others are complaining about. 

I am pissed because Blizzard, to my mind, has ruined the game to the point where I had to unsub to protest after 10 yrs consistent subbing. I even kept my sub through business trips overseas and hiatuses when I couldn't play at all or took a break for a few months.

They decided to chase a trend of social network/Facebook style games instead of sticking to the formula everyone loved.

It's like Paul Sams (former COO Blizzard) said in his first interview this week after leaving Blizzard:

**Paul Sams**: 

First and foremost, *I learned that you must put game quality and player experience first in everything that you do.* Gamers are not driven to buy games because they have a clever business model, they buy games that are *fun and immersive that deliver on what was promised.* I also learned that being a trend chaser or first mover is not a key to victory. 

*Force feeding a development team to chase a business model or game type trend* when the team doesn't love it is a likely losing proposition. A happy and motivated team that is making a game that they absolutely love *with a leadership team that doesn't force them to ship their game before it is ready is part of that formula for success.* </TEXT>

Maybe you think people should just get a whole suit of epics simply for buying the game? 

Part of what is wrong with the game now is the loss of a sense of accomplishment that comes from spending time excelling and focusing on a task, then succeeding. Those are the memories that stand out and make you smile. </TEXT>

It was a death leap but if you did it right you would end up at the GY at Menethil. Bingo flight path. Saved the run past those damn spiders, which killed you anyway, most likely.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So I am in a WoD dungeon the first time. My Hunter - I have been playing and raiding with her since July 05. 

We get in there - first pull on a group mob- all is clear behind them.. I set my pet on the target - pet hits the target. Then I use Barrage- same main target ...and the ammo is going *through my body* to hit a mob that is across the room behind me. I swear to fucking christ if the DL hadn't seen it himself and started laughing and freaking out I probably would have been kicked. 

Next area. My pet and the Lock pet both start going crazy in the room- like they are stuck on these paths like a tram on rails and going a hundred miles an hour. 

Fuck me if we didn't pull every damn thing there. Thankfully we were with old school experienced players that knew stuff was bugging out.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  level ranks gone, and fuck buying spells.

I really loved level ranks for spells. For example with a pvp mage I kept lvl 1 or 2 Blizzard and Arcane Nova keybound and could constantly pop around or blizzard areas to uncover stealthed enemies and only use tiny amounts of mana. Also, if a lower level wanted mana/health food I could make that for them. I can't do that now. 

There were benefits to all of my toons to be able to access lower level spells/abilities.  </TEXT>

Also, when calculating the difference between the calendar of Nostradamus day and ours - 1999 would actually be 2001. "King of the Mongols'' is also wrong.

I taught this class in the mid-1990's. 

L'an mil neuf cens nonante neuf sept mois,
Du ciel viendra un gran Roy d'effrayeur.
Resusciter le grand Roy d'Angolmois.
Avant apres Mars regner par bon heur.

The year 1999, Sept,
From the sky will come a great King of Terror.
To bring back to life the great King of the Mongols,
Before and after Mars to reign by good luck.

	<TEXT> At one time Route 19 in Florida had massive Jacaranda tree tunnels over long stretches. The ones from Crystal River to south of New Port Richey were astonishing. Bigger and more lush than in the picture here. But the greed heads came through, cut them all down, widened the road and stuck malls and mall parking lots all up and down the stretch. Some of those are abandoned now.

They could have made a secondary road for not much more money. Apparently someone hated trees, especially giant, lush purple blossomed trees that people would drive down from all over just to see.

So the dad, grandpa and a few cousins and brothers went to the station and waited out back for the weasels to get off work. When they came out in their civvies they drug them into an alley and 'gave them the beat-down of their lives'. Along with a threat to do it again and worse.

* Tyrion is introduced to the captive dragons. They love him because he is actually the son of Joanna Lannister and Aerys Targaryon. He sneaks down during the Pit fight and releases them. They all frolic like puppies together then go burn all the masters to death. No one makes fun of Tyrion, the Dragon Rider, ever, again.

* Jorah Mormont wins the Pit fight like the man he is- then discovers that dragons blood is the cure for Stone. A dragon graciously dribbles a little blood on his patch- curing him. He and Dany kiss and make up.

9 Miles NE - is exact. (to Zach Adams property)

Near/in a hunting preserve - is exact. (Eby's hunting preserve borders Adams property)

Tall, energetic (almost manic) man with reddish blond hair, blue eyes, ruddy, florid complexion, always kind of "wound up" - is exactly [descriptive of Zach Adams.](https://billwarnermyblog.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/2c29b-1795590_737386016306812_1563872713_n.jpg)

3 men altogether being the main perpetrators, two younger and one older - is exact. (and not normal in serial killer cases)

All of them are well known in the area - is exact.

That they have been arrested for breaking and entering, drugs, etc - is exact.

That they were part of a club/cult - is exact (the A Team, they called themselves)

Father/grandfather owning the property - is exact.

15 miles NE (where they found the remains) - is exact.

Video, pictures, media being important to the case - is exact.

That she was decapitated - is exact. 

That military or government land is involved - is exact. (where they found her remains is state property and also behind the Adams property, intersecting the Ebys Hunting reserve, is federal property).

Orange being a 'big' color as well as red - is exact. (Zachs grandfathers house and barn/storage area have a bright orange roofs- starkly stands out on the map. Zach had a red vehicle.

That birds - bird names are involved - is exact (Adams house is bordered by Duck Farm road and Eagle Creek)

That they would be caught - is exact.

Fairly general? I would say it's damn amazing. I would also say you didn't bother to read my post, but came in with a pre-concieved belief system and were really responding to that, rather than the facts.

	<TEXT> How it's never been mentioned that suspects in the Holly Bobo case are also somehow involved in the Kristie Moon disappearance:

 Kristie Baugus Moon was dating Michael Pearcy when she disappeared 10/27/1999. According to her mother, he was the last one to see her.
 
 Michael Pearcy is the son of Mark Pearcy- both Mark and Jeff Pearcy are under arrest for being accessories and accessories after the fact in the Holly Bobo kidnapping and murder.

That is from an article I wrote after digging around for info on the Bobo case some months back- at:

http://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/2fxx1l/kristie_moon_disappearance_connection_with_holly/

I haven't yet seen mention of this in any articles. It's like they want the Kristie Moon case to just blow away with the wind. And the Holly Bobo case is just fucked beyond recognition.  </TEXT>

There was not a plethora of uptight, thin lipped, disapproving, unbending, tightasses lurking around every corner waiting to smash anything outside of the right wing, talibanish, christian coalition or left wing 'gotta control people for their own good' elements. . Everything was so 'live and let live' back then. 

What the hell happened? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> they have been working hand in hand with the multinational and 'too big to fail' corporations to turn us into a large 3rd world labor force.

Haven't you noticed the massive astroturfing against Unions and labor protections? The massive inequality? Pulling the safety net (actually an outright war on the poor lately), turning 'low education' people against those in poverty- against union and labor and pollution protections? 

It keeps up and we will be as well off as Bangladesh.

[End of MOP 7.4, end of March, 7.1.](http://www.statista.com/statistics/276601/number-of-world-of-warcraft-subscribers-by-quarter/)

Reforging was a method of fine tuning and personalizing a character. *If you didn't want to use it, you didn't have to.* And as MOP RNG was not as whack as it is in WoD, not necessary. As bad as RNG is in WoD (especially Highmaul gear and random stats on made items) it would be a welcome relief.

A lot of people enjoy spending time fine tuning and personalizing their character so that they were not just generic copies of other Pally's, DK's, etc. For instance, I loved my shockadin.

There was no reason not to leave reforging in the game. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> After leveling 2 toons to 100, I boosted my old druid to 90 who, embarrassing enough, was still at 60 from 40 man progression. I leveled to 100 through WoD.

Since there were areas of the world she missed through that, I did a ground mount only run from Ghostlands to Booty Bay last week. I wanted to enjoy the music and scenery and take my time- hitting every raid in between, from Zul Aman to Zul Gurub. 

I opened it up on the LFR and had three people by Zul Aman (all 100's) who had never been in ZA (shockingly to me). From there out we ranged between 10 and 15 players the rest of the way. Mostly 100's. 

People ended up leading mini tours through their favorite areas, and it just kind of happened that way. I showed them Rausche's grave and it was pretty goosebumpy. Then another person wanted to show everyone something else and it just took off from there. 

Best day on wow in months and months. </TEXT>

Blizzard is 'facing the consequences' right now- losing over 3M subs.

Actually since you aren't a professional pollster, remarks such as "Not a SINGLE person liked reforging when we had it" and all of your other subjective remarks are absolutely worthless. 

I and every other player I know, from casual to raider, liked reforging. The 3rd party apps just simplified it. 

And.. I have never, ever heard or read a player complaining about flying. That is inconceivable to me as a 10 yr player. 

I have seen a lot of blizzard apologists lately. Considering that many of the more rabid ones ("I HATE FLYING!!") are probably Blizzard employees sent out to try to prop up a dead horse- you are pretty damn extreme.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  I don't understand why people are so dramatic when it comes to cancelling your subscription to this game.

I have one of the oldest guilds on an original vanilla server. Through the years we have made friendships - some 10 years old now. We have also lost a few people due to tragedies and illnesses. 

In our case we lost 2 friends to long term illnesses that were made a bit more bearable by the game. In these cases family members came on and met us after their passing, to request that we never remove them from our roster. And they are still there. 

So the whole "just cancel your sub and quit whining, it's only a game!" doesn't always meet with reality.

C/P from the Warcraft forums says it all: WoD has been a contraction. Not an expansion.

----------------------------------

**A list of all the removed features in WoD**

1. Flying

2. Reforging + Item Upgrades

3. Scenarios

4. Character Abilities

5. Valor/Justice Points

6. Daily quest hubs

7. 10 Heroic ('Mythic') Raiding

8. Guild levelling/perks (instead of just removing cash flow they remove the whole thing)

9. Repeatable rare mobs

----------------------------------

Has this expansion removed more than it has added?! We paid 20% more and waited 14+ months for this? Can anyone reconcile this? Never in the history of WoW have so many features been removed or scrapped. I think the community deserve an answer. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This whole 'anti-flying' thing is so strange. They are so vicious about it. 

No one is stopping them from walking-ground mounting anywhere they want to. 

It's almost like blizzard put a bunch of their 'new developers' out there to belittle and attack players who like to fly to try to lead the conversation. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yep.. I am just one of going on 4 million players who have quit the game. Why should blizzard care about that?

From the nasty attitude of white knights like you- it apparently can't happen soon enough. That's another thing I miss about old Wow. How cool and friendly most players were. Now too many of them on the forums act like 4chan rejects. If you want to walk- then fucking walk- no one is stopping you.

	<TEXT> I guess when you have been paying a monthly fee for 10 years to a company you get to feel a little 'entitled' to get at *least* the same level of service you got from the preceding years. 

Or perhaps you are the kind of person who pays for a steak and is afraid to complain when the waitress flops a hamburger on your plate.

	<TEXT> Pre-purchase for Draenor included a Raven flying mount and a promise by developers that flying will come 'later on'. 

It's like pre-purchasing a meal that includes a steak knife as part of the deal, but the dinner consists of stale bread and water with a promise of a steak 'later on'. So you then you get to 'later on' - and they don't even throw you a crumb.

	<TEXT> I was wondering about this. I am unsubbing when my last month is over. The news about flying was the final nail in that coffin, on top of the no-content train wreck of WoD. I was wondering if anyone at blizzard would be curious as to why I am unsubbing after 10 yrs.

About the 'no flying' bit:

I had a buddy who was doing design for Blizzard and she talked about the time and creativity it took to allow for play on the Z plane. 

They had to hire extra people and put in extra hours to prep areas like Elwynn forest for flight because they have unpatched, untexturized landscapes that can't be seen from a riding mount and that need finished for flight. There are also elements to coding and design that make it a bit more difficult to implement than simple ground tracking.

The (until Wod) incredible content and finish of the game is why I have paid them a monthly fee for 10 yrs. I am not going to go backwards and forego a real pleasure of the game in order to keep developers 'happy' at this stage, or save blizzard money in developer salaries.

If anti-flight players want to walk, go for it. I'm not stopping you and neither is blizzard.

	<TEXT> I was being a bit sarcastic, but the basis is true:

The precedence set here is: "Too many bullets from too many directions hit this couple for us to determine if the defendants gun fired the actual, killing blow, therefore it doesn't meet the standard of 'beyond a reasonable doubt'. 

Court precedence can be used in any future court case to justify defenses in other cases, regardless of the status of the defendent/citizen.
