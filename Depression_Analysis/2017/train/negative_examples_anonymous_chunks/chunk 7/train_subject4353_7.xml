	<TEXT> MPen is more important then AP. Kog has low AP ratios but pretty high bases. My general build goes tear, Guise, Sorcs, Rylais, Void, Ludens. You can take a death cap over Ludens if you want more consistent DPS over higher burst (this is only if you consistently hit every ult), or Grail instead for more spammability. I'm not a fan of a defensive item as you can duel basically anyone who dives you in a 1v1 with your exhaust up, but if there's more then one person you mispositioned badly and you'll likely die anyways. 

For advice just farm as safely as you can until 6, and from there just afk farm until level 11. Once you hit level 7 you can basically perma shove the enemy laner into their tower as a E + ult clears the caster minions. In team fights just spam ult for the most of it, don't get greedy and try getting into  auto attack range unless you're cleaning up or duelling a diver. You can basically duel anybody that isn't a mobile assassin late game if you have your exhaust up.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think everyone is still too hard on him. He's no longer the top adc NA, but he is still solid. NA actually has quite a bit of adc talent, and he's still in the upper end of it. I doubt they'll find anyone that is stronger then him without resorting to importing a Korean or Chinese person, which is quite risky compared to the potential reward IMO. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You must not have ever watched a single c9 game back in s3 then. Sneaky was the 'utility adc' who played Ashe in the majority of his games. If you look at any reviews/game threads of c9 back then, they would all say the same thing. Meteos and balls were the hard carries, Hai was a strong secondary carry, and the bot lane was seen as 'the weakest point' of c9.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I wouldn't say that. Historically sneaky was the person known for doing the most with little. Only in recent times has sneaky really had to be the main carry, due to hai and balls slumping early this split. Plus if you look at the fold distribution, it shows that meteos is actually the one with the highest gold priority in respect to other roles. Sneaky is dead even with the average gold alloted to an adc. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The problem with Meteos and Rush being compared is they play entirely different styles. Rush is high risk high reward, leading to him either snowballing the game or falling way behind and being useless. Meteos is low risk medium reward, meaning that he rarely will snowball a game out of control single handedly, but he  will slowly gain a gold and vision lead over the other jungler, with the downside that he won't pressure the lanes as hard unless he's guaranteed to get a kill out of it. Both junglers styles suit the styles that their team relies on, with TIP being a team that relies on snowballing and then forcing team fights, and c9 focusing on outrotating the other team until they suddenly have a 8k gold lead despite being even in kills. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> AP kog is stronger IMO late game. He has insane poke, decent burst, (you can actually one-shot squishies mid-late game with your full combo), your autos hit for 11% of max health, and you are surprisingly a very strong duelist, especially if you have exhaust up. (I've dueled late game Jarvans, Vi's, Nocturnes, and pretty much any other diving champ). The problem is that it takes so long to get to that state. You're near useless until level 11. Once you hit 16 though you're a god. 

Ad Kog is much stronger early on, and still scales very well. You trade poke and burst for higher single target DPS (even though AP Kog is still no slouch at that). He actually requires more teamwork as you have to be in auto range to do damage, requiring more peel. He's safer in lane due to having a support as well. His item powerspikes are much more defined (a kog'maw with a early Triforce is always a threat), while a fed AP Kog is still mediocre in comparison until he hits 11.

It's really a matter of preference. AD Kog takes less time to scale up, while still being a late game monster. AP Kog is oppressive post-16, and safer if you have an inkling of proper positioning. I personally prefer ap Kog, as he's a blast to play, but it's truly up to you. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Especially if you look at how the team styles are +lane match ups. TIP is great at snowballing, but struggles at catching up. I trust XWX to go even with Bjergsen in lane (as long as he doesn't try to force yasuo again), and Adrian/Apollo consistently have a even lane down bot. This leaves top lane, where they leave dyrus out to dry. Rush will camp that lane, and put dyrus way behind, and snowball impact. Impact is one of the only carry top owners left, which works perfectly with dyrus tending to feed recently. As long as XWX just farms up and doesn't do anything risky early on, I definitely think TIP should win. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The thing about meteos is that he is the most efficient jungler in NA. Rush plays a high risk high reward style, which means he either snowballs the game or falls quite behind. Meteos might not gank as much, but pretty much any gank he ever does is successful, and while other junglers might be trying to force ganks, he's slowly gaining a gold and vision lead over them. He's a low risk medium reward style. I'm not saying one style is better then the other, both are effective and suit their fellow teams. It's just hard to rank one jungler over the other purely because they are polar opposites. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not a fan of Zhonyas tbh. There's two situations that occur. The first is a single diver, which you can exhaust, and burst/kite out. If there's two or more divers, the Enemy team either got a good flank, or you positioned wrong. Either way you need to
GTFO, and staying still for a Zhonyas is the exact opposite of it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It truly is champion/role/situation dependent. If you're an ADC/APC, it's best to just play it super safe and get your damage items. As a top laner usually you will go tanky if your behind and damage if your ahead. Purely because building tank means you will survive longer in lane, which means you'll have more gold to catch up. Or since jungler are already gold starved, it's best to build tanky when your behind as one of them. It is really situational though, just because I'm 0/2 on irelia doesn't mean I stop rushing the triforce and start building a randuins, the spike from the completed triforce will give me a better chance to come back in the game then a bit of tankiness.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sorry, but I doubt that Xin can deal with a late game Jax or Nasus. He's very auto attack dependent, and both of them have direct counter to auto attack duelists in their kit. Plus they are both naturally tankier and have higher damage outputs in their kit. I agree that he destroys all 3 of them early game, but once irelia grabs her triforce, Jax gets a couple items, or nasus hits a couple hundred stacks they can all easily 1v1 them. Xin is still a very good duelist, just that the three you mentioned are arguably the strongest in the game at some point. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Try nocturne. He has amazing waveclear, shreds towers with all of his bonus stats, a great duelist, plus decent escapability. Ideally, you want to ward the enemy jungle, and wait for someone you can 1v1 to pass through the jungle to defend your push. You ult onto them, pick them off and either have a free turret, or give your team a 4v3 advantage.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Also, picking someone like Jax/zed and just relentlessly split pushing against them can help. A downside of their comp is that they have zero strong duelists, and they will be forced to bring lulu up to prevent them from getting anything. Without lulu this comp can't really do too much so it should be an easy 4v4 </TEXT>
