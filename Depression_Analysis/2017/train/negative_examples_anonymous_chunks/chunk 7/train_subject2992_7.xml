	<TEXT> A word of warning if you purchase those GTX 970s from Amazon UK, don't do it. Take a look at the graph at the bottom of their page, the price is going up and down too often for my liking. I'm presuming however you're going to be buying them from Ebuyer anyway, but just in case. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> She probably is still pregnant, in the last scene in the cafe she was about to tell the Doctor something before the conversation turned to Gallifrey. Besides, Orson Pink still needs to be born in the future with Danny and Clara as his ancestors. I'm surprised it wasn't revealed in this episode though. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> After watching the preview of this episode, here is what I think will happen:
Clara is pregnant, that is what she was calling to tell Danny before he died. Danny is going to die in this episode and be converted into a Cyberman. When converted into a Cyberman, something will happen that causes him to retain emotions and memories of Clara, they will then discuss Clara's pregnancy and have a heartfelt goodbye.
Clara's baby will then be the ancestor of Orson Pink. </TEXT>
