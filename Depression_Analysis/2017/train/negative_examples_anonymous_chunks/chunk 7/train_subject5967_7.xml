Everything was going well. We ended up having a chat and we found out that he and I actually went to high school together in the same year level, in fact we were Facebook friends!

When you take a step back and look at it, of the tens of thousands of Australians on the dozens of Oceanic servers for him to be the right class, the right level of experience, the right faction AND the right server is an insane coincidence.

	<TEXT> My favourite part of the Daily Show is always the segments where it's just Jon and a topic. No silly cut aways, no pre recorded bits with his colleagues and no interviews.

Just Jon, a topic and his passion for truth, satire and humor. 

John Olivers show is pretty much that entire thing, wrapped into a single 30 minute show. A show (which by the way, thanks to HBO) has no concerns for censorship due to sponsorship.

I would be fucking ecstatic if John Olivers show could be increased to an hour, or perhaps several 30 minute episodes per week. That being said, the show looks like they put **SO MUCH** effort into their 1 episode that this maybe hard to do. 

Either way, I'm happy Last Week Tonight exists because I'm not sure how well The Daily Show will be without Jon Stewart. 

Then again I had that worry when John Oliver took over in 2013 and boy oh boy was I happy with the result :)  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This won't compare to some of the shit in here, I guess I'm lucky.

I was pinned down by a dirt bike which had been running for hours that I had crashed. The red hot exhaust pipe was pinned against my left calf muscle for like 20~ seconds while I tried to squeeze out. That was painful, but that's not the worst part.

The worst part was that I was a 16 year old fucking idiot who didn't go to the doctors and I took very poor care of the wound. The palm sized burn ended up becoming really infected and it became so painful that I couldn't even have a blanket over my leg.

I ended up getting it disinfected and started treating it, but it took so long for that wound to heal properly. 

Gah, the smell was awful.

I don't know what's wrong with me, because a few years later I had another incident where I sliced my index finger almost down to the bone on a metal door and me fearing getting stitches (for the 4th time in my life) I just washed the wound and bandaged it tight.

It ended up getting fucking infected really bad and for the longest of time I thought I wouldn't be able to fully bend my index finger. It eventually healed but I'm kicking myself that I didn't get it properly treated. I guess I didn't want to run to my parents crying about it. </TEXT>

I'm not sure why that's important to me, perhaps it's because I've had financial responsibility hammered into me from my parents so much growing up.

	<TEXT> I was having this conversation with a friend who did a tour overseas in the army. It was an interesting conversation actually. He firmly states that if a woman can handle the **exact** same physical requirements as the men, then she deserves to be in the front line (in fact, he mentions several woman in high esteem who met this requirement). He told me the problem lies with fraternisation.

Sadly it happens and there is little you can do about it. When you're in the field you can't have the soldiers in relationships, it causes fractures and distractions in the team. This isn't entirely about women. Apparently this happens with gay soldiers all the time and the problem is equally as bad in those instances. Even exterior to relationships, the additional distraction of women in the front line causes problems too. You can cite this as a problem with men in society, it doesn't matter - it's likely going to happen.

I always thought that it was clear cut, if a woman want's to be a front line grunt and can handle the physical and mental requirements - then she should be able to.

But there are other portions to this equation. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Good reminder to everyone.

Something else to keep in mind - the time will go **much** quicker if you let what you're doing become part of your daily routine. But it will also go quick if you don't spend too much of your day obsessing over it. That's where I get a little conflict in me. This subreddit is an awesome place if you need support or information, but it can be bad if you're an impatient person.

Ever had a boring class in highschool where you're constantly looking at the clock on the wall? Time tends to go slower that way. So while I'm not telling people to go away from this subreddit, I would recommend not looking at the clock as often if you're impatient. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I totally get where you're coming from, I've been sober for the past 4 months in an effort to lose this weight. It's been somewhat tough, I came to realise that you don't have to drink heavily to have fun, as lame as that sounds it's true!

I found that while you can have a cheat night every now and again, try just drinking water. You can be the designated driver for your friends, they'll likely love you for it.

The point is that if you're serious about dropping some weight, you do need to make sacrifices. If the amount you drink every week is what's stopping you, you need to weigh up your wants versus your needs.

Something I tell myself every weekend when I think about having a drink is "the reason that your friends can drink is because you overdid it for years and they didn't. You've had enough, it's time to work off the deficit"

Granted this information is from a guy who is quite a bit more overweight than yourself, I think it may still be helpful. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Good point actually, remember that episode of Family Guy where Brian has sex with Quagmire's post op father and when he finds out he does that extended vomit scene?

He copped shit loads of flak for that scene from the LGBT community.

That being said, Mcfarlane's response was rather interesting.

[He also defended Brian's vomiting after discovering he had sex with someone who had undergone sex reassignment surgery noting Brian's character is heterosexual and "If I found out that I had slept with a transsexual, I might throw up in the same way that a gay guy looks at a vagina and goes, 'Oh, my God, that's disgusting.'"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quagmire%27s_Dad#Reception)

They could just as easily have made Sly the main star of the trailer. But Sly doesn't even turn up till like the last quarter of the video.

	<TEXT> Just to give you a measure of speed of lost, I'm a 27 yo 5'9 male. 4 months ago I was 285 lbs, I'm now down to 242. 

I was losing crazy amounts of weight in the first month. I easily dropped the first 18 lbs in the first month. After that it soon started to taper off rather quickly, without me changing my diet at all.

At higher weights you're always going to lose weight quicker **at first**. Assuming that you're not eating too little and exercising too much, you should be fine.

Of course, I would talk to a doctor and do some research of your own.

 Well done though! ~50 lbs is a great feat!

	<TEXT> My last relationship started like this. I got a FB message from a friend asking if I was single and if I were interested in a cool chick he knew. I was curious so I said yes. 

We chatted on Facebook for a bit and hit it off. Dated for almost a year, it was quite nice actually.

I'd almost rather meeting girls via friends. That way you can get someone you know and trust to vouch both to me and the other person.

Helps weed out the crazies too :D </TEXT>

	<TEXT> After my break up with a serious relationship in my early 20s, I went out and had a rebound hook up. I moved WAY too fast, I was trying to replace a lost part of me from the break up.

She ended up moving in with me very quickly and I didn't even really like her all that much. The sex was average and our chemistry wasn't even all that solid. She was actually kind of crazy.

I ended up regretting having that empty hookup for the longest of time. As cliche as it sounds, random hookups really are not worth pursuing in that context.

I should qualify that ONSs are only really bad if you're trying to replace someone instead of having fun with a stranger. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I love his work.

What I really admire is that he takes the same stance on his routine as George Carlin. He scraps his routine every year and writes new material. You have to respect that his act changes every year. Check out his specials, they're wonderful. 

Also, his stance on selling his DRM free content is remarkable. He does all of his own directing, shooting and editing then he provides *direct to the consumer* digital downloads. You can actually download his stand up specials for a one off payment of $5 and he makes some serious cash out of it. It's quite brilliant.

Plus anyone who can make me laugh about sexually stimulating a sewer rat has some real skill in comedy.

Edit: My point is that even if these non human sources of litter only accounted for a small percentage of litter, the job of litter collector would still exist.

Edit 2: I get it, in a perfect world litter wouldn't exist. This thread isn't about a perfect hypothetical society. And not picking up everyone elses trash doesn't make you a *dick*. If it did, *litter*ally 99% of us would be dicks. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Everyone is different. Some would rather many small meals throughout the day and that's fine. Others (like me) prefer to have 2 larger meals for the day.

The latter suited me better, so my change was to work out the rough calories for the meals I like. Once I had that number and determined how much my body requires at a safe deficit I (through willpower) stopped myself from eating.

I know consciously that my body had enough energy to keep going and the hunger I was feeling was superficial. Once you objectify food as an energy source and not solely as a source of pleasure, you realise how easy it can be to put the fork down.

So as strange as it sounds - *I fixed my relationship by objectifying my partner*.

	<TEXT> It really isn't that big of a deal, not in the long run. Once you see that you need to consume 3500 *extra* calories over your budget to gain a single pound of fat - you can see that going a bit over once in a while isn't the end of the world.

The important thing is to make sure that you don't have these cheat meals too often. Weight loss is about long term consistency. It's fine to stop your marathon for a few seconds before continuing :) </TEXT>

You're totally on the money here, it was **exactly** the same as his normal episodes.

I think when some take issue with the main segments premise, it throws a spanner in the works for the show itself.

I guess that's a good thing? The show would be boring if you totally 100% agreed with everything that John says :)

I have to say, that afternoon was incredibly helpful. We learned how to recover from a skid, how to identify un-roadworthy problems with your car and how different speeds can affect different braking distances.

It made me a much more capable and confident driver, 10 years later and I've still never had an accident. </TEXT>
