	<TEXT> 39 States now have mandates to provide these services if employees are on a certain plan. Virginia is on that list but not sure if that plan would cover it. I agree with /u/cakeisatruth that ABA is not the only way but has been found to be beneficial by the U.S. government take that as you may. Additionally, Temple Grandin has came out and said that ABA is beneficial but the more important part is finding what your child loves and use that as a motivator. I have noticed that when therapy is provided that is what happens during ABA. Speech, and occupational therapy are added benefits and will compound those self life skills. I'd be more interested in reading /u/cakeisatruth comment about masking their symptoms and making children seem more neurotypical.

	<TEXT> Have you ever been to Disney Land, there is no such thing as getting on other rides with short lines. So you show up to the ride and are given a return time but in the mean time you can't ride anything else as the lines are just as long. Additionally you can't get another return time for a different ride because you still haven't returned for the queue yet. I don't claim to know how Disney Land works but at Disney World most waits times are an hour plus. http://touringplans.com/magic-kingdom/wait-times

What is Disability Access Service and how does it work? 
DAS is intended for Guests whose disability prevents them from waiting in a conventional queue 
environment. Once issued at specified Guest Relations locations, DAS can be used to obtain a return 
time for an attraction comparable to the current conventional queue wait time. As soon as a Guest 
finishes one attraction, they can receive a return time for the same or a different attraction. </TEXT>
