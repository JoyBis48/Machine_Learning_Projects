	<TEXT> "Of all that was found. And all that was lost." -John Connoly. The Book Of Lost Things. 

It was the last book my father read. I read it a year after he died. I was 12 and so was the protagonist, both of us grieving a lost parent.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> [I Am The Messenger] (http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19057.I_Am_the_Messenger)
The character is a bit older, but its a very good book. The book is mostly about the development of a young man whose life at the beginning of the novel is rather stagnant and unfulfilling.  </TEXT>
