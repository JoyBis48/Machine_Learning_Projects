	<TEXT> Its actually relatively easy to do it yourself. Go into any Auto zone and they sell a oil change "deal" that includes all the things you need including an air filter for a reasonable price. All you really need is a screwdriver and to get your hands a little dirty, but an oil change is super easy.


Air filter?  Screw driver?  

Last time I checked,  you don't need an air filter for an oil change.  Maybe you meant oil filter?

	<TEXT> I give a shit about spelling because it reflects on a person's character. Someone who can't be bothered to use the correct pronoun contraction not only shows their lack of education, but it shows they lack the attention to detail required to function at a high level.

Sometimes a mistake is a mistake, but why let a simple spelling or grammar error undermine your whole argument? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> All these people telling you that you NEED to go to college don't know what they're talking about.

You have the job now, it pays well, stay with it since it makes more sense financially. You always have the option to go to college later on.

Not having a degree won't impact your hireability (is that a word?) since you'll have your work experience to back you up.

To paraphrase a friend. 
   You may be a college graduate applying for the entry level manager position, but the guy that dropped out of high school to work for the company, applying for the same position, has 6 years experience on you and he already works there.  </TEXT>
