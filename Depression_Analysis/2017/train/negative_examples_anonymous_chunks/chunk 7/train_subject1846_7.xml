	<TEXT> That's also one of the reasons you can't have Chris Pratt. He is Chris Pratt in every role. I agree with you on Bradley to a degree though, I just think he looks a lot like young Harrison Ford.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Bradley Cooper looks the part. Chris Pratt has got the charisma but he's basically one big goof and I wouldn't want to see him as Indiana.  This Matthew Davis guy looks acceptable, but I don't know if he has the charisma or the star power or the acting chops. </TEXT>
