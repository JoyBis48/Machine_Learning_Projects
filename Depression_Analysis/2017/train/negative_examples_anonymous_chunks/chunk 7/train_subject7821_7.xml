	<TEXT> Politics...Gov Bryant is conservative   he's looking to replace Jones with someone he can control. Bryant has exercised some anti-education measures since taking office.  Another example of Bryant being a disgrace to the state of MS. 

Bryant's supporters blame Jones for phasing out all the 'dixie', 'confederate flags',   'Ole Miss' which has been happening for over a decade despite Jones only working for a couple of years. Since taking office, Jones has gotten great support.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not worried about nepotism in the White House (families like Clinton, Bush, etc) as much as the behind the scenes cronies who've been pulling strings for decades. 

For example, take Roger Ailes, Cheney,   Rumsfield. They've been involved since the Nixon administration in EVERY republican seat holder. While experienced, they've made careers of getting their way in smokey rooms. Term limits should be applied to these positions.  </TEXT>
