	<TEXT> Go to www.nicvape.com and buy the 1/100mg mix of non flavored nicotine.

In a 30ml bottle you'll need (buy a 30ml bottle of juice and tip some out)


7.2ml for 24mg

5.5ml for 18mg

3.5ml for 12mg

1.8ml for 6mg


If you're vaping for the first time ever and usually smoke 12mg smokes, I recommend starting off on 18mg juice then quickly ween yourself down to 12mg.

Enjoy and keep off the smokes!

	<TEXT> In ELI5 fashion, lightning can definitely blow up more than just your PC.

If lightning hits the power lines coming into your house for instance, it can provide a sudden surge of power over and above what your appliances can handle, thus cooking them good and proper.

Most of the time if you're lucky it will just fry your power supply.

I'll need someone a bit more scientific to clarify, but it wouldn't be so much the voltage that will blow it all up, it would be the amperage. 

In Aus, all appliances (generally) are rated for 240v @ 10amp.. Lightning definitely beats both those specs.

A surge protector does what its name says, it would be fused up in there to limit the total voltage and amperage although be a lot more sensitive than a normal house fuse.. Once it goes over its rated amount it will trip.

I'm sure someone will disprove me completely, or hopefully just clarify and clean up my post a little. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I met a 25 year old girl recently that's still a virgin.. 

I'm a 30 year old with a little boy I'm trying to raise, I ended it.

I knew that she has a whole life ahead of her and doesn't need the life I would provide, and as hard as she was pushing for me to be her first, it's not something I was willing to do.

Apart from the above, being with a virgin is a guaranteed dud root. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think now that's it's officially here, use your US login account you created and it all should be there. 

I may be wrong, but I think I might've heard about this working the other day.

Either way, I have unblockus working through my router and heavily enjoy Hulu and Netflix from the US.

	<TEXT> I don't know, if you compare the first 10 seasons of each show, overall the Simpsons wins it for me and was quite clever.

Problem is that fox has milked the Simpsons 15 years too long.

Seinfeld  Simpsons  Married with Children. 

I do agree though, seven was a cunt when he was introduced to the show.

One thing MWC managed to pull off was the introduction of Jefferson, it was one of the few times on a TV show that the replacement character was better than the original. </TEXT>
