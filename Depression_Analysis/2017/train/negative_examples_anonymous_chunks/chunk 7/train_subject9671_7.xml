	<TEXT> Almost crashed my car several times with others in it, not through my own fault luckily, but close calls nonetheless.

Once accidentally smashed a lightbulb over my friends head.

And almost killed myself three times, once touching a live wire attached to a TV set, once by pulling a full paint can down onto my head from on top of a tall book case, and lastly by falling out of the top of a tree. Believe it or not, it was hitting the branches on the way down that saved me, and stopped me from actually getting any more serious injury than a few bruises! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I try to get it published!

I've got two short stories already out and published in anthologies, got another one coming out in an anthology sometime this year (date not confirmed yet).

I'm always writing new stories and submitting them to anthologies. I've written two novels, but nothing I'd show to the world yet. Both of those were to prove to myself that I COULD write to that length, and still maintain relationships/arcs/general story interest. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Slender-Man. Kept turning around to see how close behind me he was. No-where to be seen. Turn back to keep running, he's only in my bloody face isn't he.

I hit the ceiling.


ALSO, the first time I ever played Dino Crisis, there's a particular hallway where you go through like five/six times before you go through it and Raptors jump through the windows at you. TOTALLY did not see that one coming either. Screamed like a bitch (I was like 13/14). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> From as early as I can remember in my first house (until I was 12 years old), I NEVER slept facing my bedroom doorway (It had no door), because I KNEW if I looked that way, I would see what was standing there and it would be able to come into the room and get me.

It's like you KNOW that if you throw a ball, gravity will bring it down.

I KNEW, without needing proof or confirmation, that there WAS something, and I don't know what, standing in my doorway every night. Occasionally I'd hear it walk along the landing from the lower end of our house until it stood outside my bedroom door, and I KNEW if I looked at it, it could come in and it WOULD kill me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't believe in "God", but I do enjoy looking at the architecture, the well-made stained glass, the ornaments. Also the ambiance of other people's holy places always humbles me a little. Despite not believing myself, I can respect that many other people do, and it makes me think. I like the way my mind wanders in these sort of places. </TEXT>

Everyone else seems to be able to do it, and I can only do it when I hold my breath (so that the oxygen in my torso keeps me afloat). If I let my breath out my legs drag me down into the water.

I tend to float about two feet below the water line (helpful). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Honourable mention goes out to my best friend; when I broke up with my almost seven years girlfriend, I had spent the entire day walking around the nearby lakes, crying and listening to music.

He came out after he finished work (earlier than he had to, I might add), picked me up, took me back to his, supplied me with alcohol, fish and chips, played some online games with me, watched a film with me, chatted to me, and finally gave me a big hug and told me I did the right thing.

If he was on Reddit, he'd deserve to win this thread. </TEXT>

- Frisbee-throwing a slice of cheese across the playground at one another, it hit a girl we knew in the face. Result = my friend got slapped

- Car Surfing (I'll let you imagine that one)

- Farting VERY loudly in the middle of a drama class (it was at EXACTLY the right point in someone else's piece) (childish I know, but we were kids)

- Skipping school several times for various reasons (to play trading card games, to play the playstation, to just hang out at a park we knew)

And so many, many injuries that I can barely remember them all. </TEXT>
