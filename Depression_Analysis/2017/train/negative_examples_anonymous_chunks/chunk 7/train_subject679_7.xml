	<TEXT> I have nothing against Hotel California. I don't know why she hates it. It's kind of what inspired me to post this, because I like seeing what weird things set people off. I also have a friend who hates the word "moist." In conclusion, quirks are neat and I just rambled a lot. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A friend of mine really really hates "Hotel California." To the point that she'd rather listen to static. I feel similarly about Taylor Swift's "Bad Blood." I've seen posts talking about favorite songs and classic songs, but I'd like to know about the songs you hate! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Nacho Crunch Grilled Stuft burritos. Holiday Spice Pepsi. My ex fiancee worked at the pepsi plant and we had cases and cases of the stuff. I should have appreciated it more. </TEXT>
