If I look on the job sites, there are loads of "really good jobs" that I probably have a realistic shot at. But I'm not interested to just switch the company and do the same/similar stuff somewhere else. I just struggle to find what I want to do. I was hoping to get some ideas here by learning what other people to for a living.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have lived in London 4 years. The first year was university and then I started working and at the beginning I liked my corporate job. Money was good and I got to travel loads. 

By now I just hate it. Huge pressure on a daily basis and ever increasing levels of burocracy make me want to kill myself every day. Especially because at the end of the day I have nothing to look at and say: Well done, I made this or that or I helped him or her. 

If you are or have been at a similar point, do you have any recommendations?

I would like to find a job that is not the usual London corporate crazy. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Almost fainted last night in the gym doing dead lifts. What was the reason? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-03-24 14:53:06 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi, I am currently using the strong lifts 5x5 app and I really like it. It keeps me motivated and I have been to the gym 3 times a week for the last two months which is really good for me. 

I have been able to increase dead lifts from 70 kg to 100kg. Up until 95kg I found it hard, but not too hard. Last Friday I did 100kg for the first time. I did 5x 60kg and then 5x 80 kg as warm ups. Yesterday I was about to try 102.5 kg. However I had to stop. I did 5x 60kg and 5x 80kg warm up. When I wanted to do 5x 92.5kg warm up I did 2 reps and felt funny. I dropped the weight and almost fainted. In the end I was fine and nothing happened but I was very surprised. 

I have lifted that weight before a few times, so what could be the reason. I know that I failed to drink water throughout the day yesterday. Could that be it? Or did I not eat enough? Or is it likely that something else was the reason?

EDIT: Thanks for the feedback. Breathing and water seem to be key.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't know you and I do not know your background or opinion, so please don't take it personal.

If that is your reasoning then that's fine, but then don't complain later that rents are too high. (I am not saying you do)

I am just saying people have no integrity. They all want things to change but nobody is willing to do anything for it. The only thing people with money understand is if you boycott their BS. And if you want things to change you have to start with the man in the mirror and not just expect others to do the shitty work for you. 

Rents are too high in London? Don't move here or move away.

Rent for a certain flat is unacceptable? Don't move in. 

But then somebody else will move in there and nothing will change anyway and on top of that you don't have a flat and that other person does? Maybe. But maybe at some point everybody refuses this BS and we actually make a difference. Be the change that you want to see. I know it sounds so silly but it is true.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's true. I posted a stupid question got stupid answers. Next day I went to the gym, started the 5x5 strength thing and  2 weeks later I feel like I am on the right track. I got inspired by one of the top posts (the female ) and just did it. I'm still adjusting my diet but at least I've started and I did it by reading other posts  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey, thanks for your answer. 

For point 1, this is from the second link in the side bar:

+20% maintenance calories on workout days, -20% maintenance on non-workout days. Varying your caloric amounts is important

If it's wrong, why is it in the sidebar?

And for the second point I was considering to do this all in one day three times a week. I have been doing the same exercises for the past 3 months (however as bodyweight exercises). I do not think it would be a problem. Why do you think it would be pointless? 
If I split that over 3 days, I will be in the gym for 30 minutes only. 

EDIT: Sorry, I forgot: My goal is to do a recomp as described in the sidebar link. I do not really want to lose weight or bulk. Just want to look fitter and get stronger. I weigh 79kg and I have been doing bodyweightfitness for the last three months.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think you got this wrong, but I am not sure. 

There is no grey area. As soon as you download it is illegal. However, when you stream the file is only temporarily on your computer and you have no access to it so that you could copy it. That is why streaming is still ok. Torrenting is not legal anywhere in Europe. This is why you should not use popcorn time in Europe if you are scare of getting caught. Neither the uploading nor the downloading is legal.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Acer S3 Ultrabook won't boot with HDMI cable attached. Please help </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-02-14 13:01:03 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi,

My SO has an Acer S3 ([this one](http://www.notebookcheck.net/Review-Acer-Aspire-S3-391-53314G52add-Ultrabook.81619.0.html)). We decided to install Windows 7 Home Premium 64 bit. 

Now the problem is that the laptop won't boot with an HDMI cable attached to it. If you remove the cable it boots fine. If you attach the cable after it booted, it works fine. 

We use a HDMI to DVI cable, but it also does not work with an HDMI to HDMI cable or with a different screen. 

If anybody has had this before, we would really appreciate if you could share your solution. It is nothing bad, just an inconvenience to always remove the cable before booting. 

But I even if it can't be fixed I would like to understand it.

Many thanks in advance. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I know there are endless explanations about why people think Leo is still in a dream e.g. the thing with the wedding ring. 

I have a very different problem with the film:

For me as a spectator the film ends after the final scene and I am left to wonder whether he is still trapped in a dream or not. That is fair enough and I guess what Nolan wanted. 

However, when I watch a film, I try to imagine that the characters are real, right? And that is why the ending is bullshit. For me as a spectator the movie stops right there, but for Leo it doesn't. He will come back into the house eventually and see if his totem is still spinning or not. That means for him there are two scenarios: 

1. By the time he comes back into the house the totem stopped spinning and he lives happily with his children
2. He comes back in and the thing is still spinning - He knows he was fooled and is still in a dream. He actually wants to get back into the real world so if this happens, the story is not over for him.

So if Nolan wanted an open ending he should have gotten rid of the totem before anybody (us or Leo) was able to find out if the totem will drop. This way he just fails to tell us the end of the story.  </TEXT>
