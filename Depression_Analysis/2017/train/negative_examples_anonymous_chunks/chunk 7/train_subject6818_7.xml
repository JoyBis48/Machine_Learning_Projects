	<TEXT> Yea man...  This is kind of weird..  Not trying to be rude but in a time where it's virtually impossible not to be found unless you don't want to be...  Gives me the sense that she doesn't want to be found.. 

Edit: the more I think of this...  You are really being creepy man.  You just posted a women's personal info all over the Web. You are naming two aliases of hers which shows she has tired to hide her identity. Your account history doesn't ease my stress either being an account that's new and has questionable post history. You have admitted to wrong doings you wish to amend which gives us a reason to believe that there is reason to her not talking to you.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Rondo is a "me"  first player who has turned out two teams...  One better situated than us...  In less than two years.  He is gonna be costly and has no loyalty to the team. Cousins + Rondo techs are way more than we need and I doubt we will be able to keep Rondo contract down.  I don't want him here. I'd rather Lawson and that is saying alot because I'd rather neither right now... 


I really hope Rondo stays away...  If I'm crazy please help me see why you want him...  </TEXT>

Nice parks all over.  The bike trail is a must. Old folsom, old town sacramento, old roseville and old fair oaks are just cool places to be.  Lots of craft Mico brewers with open mic nights. Alot to do if you do it with the right people. 

My girlfriend and I were in old folsom the other day.  She was shooting photography while I skated. We then caught an open mic night and spent $10. Living the dream?  Haha </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Idk about Miller.  Possibly with his relation to Karl.  We also need to be careful about setting  the bar to high for Vlade. He also is new in his position and has basically made it so all falls on him. Bad decisions happen and I don't want us getting to upset when Vlade makes a bad decision.


We have a huge upside this year and I would be surprised if we didn't make alot of moves tomorrow.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Personally I go out of my way to avoid Grant. So I would have to say no on having to caught his opinion of boogie. Is boogie a bad locker mate?  Maybe.  I'd be pissed off as well if I was scoring 25+ pts and grabbing 12+ rebounds.  I have voiced in here how often Cousins and Gay fight. We have a young talented squad with a young new FO. It takes sometime to settle down and get it right.  Malone was a shitty thing to do and I'm sure that perturbed Cousins but he has to be strict on a team of people who look up to him. Andre miller seemed to help calm Cousins down towards the end of the year.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not saying we wouldn't trade him.  I'm saying we are not trading him. Karls statement was taken out of context in April.  He was merely saying we are always looking for opportunities to get better. That is how I took it.  No man above the law.  If a deal was to good to pass up...  It's business.  But it makes no sense trading him right now. Especially what's been reported as trade offers.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> First of all... Fuck /r/nba which is a circlejerk to stir up drama/entertainment. Take them for what they are and don't buy into bs. 

/r/Kings know our FO better.  I truthfully believe that Vlade won't trade Cousins for multiple reasons. 

- you don't trade young superstars to risk landing young superstars. 

- you don't trade the best center in the league for pork and beans. 

- Cousins resigned because he wants to play here. 

- Shit... WE RESIGNED HIM BECAUSE WE WANT HIM! 

Karl got 3 months of play with Cousins... [We all know Demarcus is an emotional lesbian](https://youtu.be/m9zdn6E3KbE) and he may have overreacted to rumors.  He's 24. Shit happens. He wants to win and he's frustrated. 

Pete is probably leaking shit to tear apart an organization that he despises. Malone may be feeding it too.  Fagan can only capitalize off the drama. Fans are showing true colors by Making claims of "jumping ship". We went from hopes of  a playoff birth to hating the Coach all from Twitter. 


Rudy Gay and Stauskas are real pieces on the table yet no one is acknowledging this. Let's regroup.  Calm down.  Prep for the draft tomorrow.  Fuck this Lawson BS.  Fuck this Celtics Cousins circle jerk
Fuck you Isaiah. 

New arena.  New Coach.  Top pick.  All star Center. Let's get back to real basketball talk.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> How would you guys feel about FA signs gs of these two and drafting WCS.  I still like McCallum and feel he isn't a horrible 1 and with us keeping Nik in the mix and developing maybe having a deep 1 isn't  a good idea.  


Instead we don't resign Evans and we dump Landry.  Pick up these players. 

Starting lineup

- Cousins (WCS) 

- Thompson (Cousins) 

- Gay

- Williams

- Collison

2nd string

- depends on who officially starts

- Young

- Casspi

- Mclemore

- McCallum (Stauskas) 

Bench: Dwill,  TBD.
