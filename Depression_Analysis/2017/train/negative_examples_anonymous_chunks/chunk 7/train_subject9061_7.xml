	<TEXT> Cough newspapers cough.

The funny thing is when you see some technowarrior on here laugh at newspapers closing I just shake my head.

I admire wikileaks but it is not going to be able to do what the time or the guardian does.

You complain about tv news being shit - go out and vote with your wallet. Subscribe to X Y and Z. Get an international, one more local, one magazine with commentary. Digital or paper. 

Money where mouth is.

These stations have sponsors, loads of money, they pander to the dumb masses.

You want good journalism, pick up a paper.

Otherwise - and this goes to 99% of users on reddit who complain about this - just shut up.

Horrible to say but a truth isn't it

Not for me (penny dreadful anyone?) it's too slow for the average viewer

And I have to agree. Should have loaded the show, 5 series formula, moved far quicker

Why cancel? Is there producer deals in place that stops a new showrunner changing it?

	<TEXT> Hyperbole but I understand the point he is trying to make.

 And if he did that today he'd probably be criticized for it, the way the Godzilla director was criticized for not showing Godzilla early enough.

If the 2nd half of that Godzilla film was actually good it wouldn't have mattered. People wanted godzilla because they were bored shitless staring at one of the most blank and charmless actors that hollywood has now decided to add to the roster of young talent.

 A summer blockbuster isn't going for Oscars? What a fucking shock!

  I just think its pretty hilarious given that JW is breaking a lot of money-making records, so I'm sure the studio is SO SAD when you criticize the movie

Shame on some people for wanting to discuss the movie despite its financial success or what the studio thinks, shame.

 Also, you editorialized the headline in this post, which is kind of bad form.

No I didn't, that was a result of the suggest title.

	<TEXT> Inoffensive is rather a harsh term in my book. 

Some films = entertainment, sure I get it, but when something is so lifeless and slapped together makes you wonder who is at fault here?

People bitching about the lack of original movies don't go see original movies (fuck sake they think mad max and dredd are somehow original)

Movie making by numbers. A computer could write the script, hit the beats, put in the awful dialogue and away you go. 

Which is fine when it makes money.

But it is like they sometimes don't think they need to try anymore. Just tie it together and push it out. 

Outside of the animation people and the score there was zero artistry in that movie. </TEXT>

 I never mentioned it, everyone knows this, nothing to do with the reality of musicians earnings

I just explained that point, in the very sentence you pasted. Are you serious? You actually answered your post for me. How everyones knows about the new ways to do those things, but it doesn't change the reality about earnings.

Which was the topic.

  The only way musicians are going to have a chance at making real money from their music is if we do away with record companies, which is what the internet is doing.

And again I said it wasn't, all it did was open the gates and allow millions to scramble for the meagres. No *real* money involved. Only the lucky few will get anything, much like the system with labels.

Again, would you like to come back to the topic on hand and address that?

	<TEXT> Way to address nothing there. 

I say again the internet has changed nothing in practical monetary earning terms, it just opened the pool to everyone.

 We are not talking about the new ability to distribute, advertise etc etc, I never mentioned it, everyone knows this, nothing to do with the reality of musicians earnings, but of course you brought it up as some proof how right you are, baffling

I'd ask you to actually argue but I don't think you want to. The fact you really do think you are right is insane to me.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We are talking about the internet changing things, dumping labels and allowing artists to earn money.

You go off on a tangent which is irrelevant to the fact that all it has done it made a level playing field for millions, and so with everyone scrambling for money few earn, the exact same way it is now.

Do you understand? 

 , so that's somehow a bad thing? 

Course it is. Most musicians will fucking tell you this. A saturated market is now just fucked.

Deals, beiber, money - yawn - heard it all before. Nothing you say is new. I can't stress this enough.

	<TEXT>  The film begins with a continuous four-minute take that starts on a television screen showing a Hindi soap opera and pulls out into the street, where armed gangs are furiously searching for a man, gunning down anyone in their path who might be his ally. They bomb his house. When the pressure becomes too much to bear, there is a cut, and with it, an exhale. But there is no loss of tension. The film powers forward, relentless, for the next five hours.

Sounds pretty amazing. </TEXT>
