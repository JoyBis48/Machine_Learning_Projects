	<TEXT> I'm not convinced.  Comparing the photo to paintings isn't a compelling argument. Just look at all the paintings of WAM and you'll see great diversity in the way his features are represented (nose, eyes, etc.) 

Also, she would have been 78 at the time of the photo. Where is her gray hair?   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Leonore is unique among opera heroines.  How many female leads can you think of who are strong, powerful and rescue the man?  I always suspected that Fidelio was criticized because the world wasn't ready for a powerful, heroic woman like Leonore.  LvB was ahead of his time.
Among the great recordings of Fidelio: Toscanini (no dialogue but the singing is superb); Haitink with Jessye Norman.  There is a stupendous opera film of Fidelio from Hamburg with a magnificent cast: Anja Silja, Richard Cassilly, Lucia Popp, Theo Adam, Hans Sotin, Erwin Wohlfahrt, Ernst Wiemann, Leopold Ludwig (conductor), Rolf Liebermann (director). </TEXT>
