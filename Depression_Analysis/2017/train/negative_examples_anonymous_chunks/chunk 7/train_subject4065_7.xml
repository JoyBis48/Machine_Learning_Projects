	<TITLE> Help: Property sale as settlement in 2013 for divorce finalized in 2014 </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-03-03 17:27:20 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> To make it quick and hopefully easy to understand (and I REALLY appreciate any help):

1) Sold real estate in August of 2013. The sale was a part of a divorce settlement.
2) The divorce is actually finalized in 2014.

My understanding is I won't be taxed on the profits of that sale since it was a settlement (the money is ultimately going to the ex wife).

Is this correct?

Thanks again for any help.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Add a speed bag to a Bowflex Body Tower </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-01-21 00:55:26 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi Reddit DIY,

I'm not that handy...so help with this is appreciated.

I want a speed bag (you know, boxing...) but I don't want to drill into my wall or buy a more expensive free standing one. I do, however, already own a Bowflex Body Tower (http://www.amazon.com/Bowflex-BodyTower/dp/B006353HCE) so I thought it could be possible to add one to it.

Note that I am 6'2" and the Body Tower is just taller than I by about 2 inches, so I need to account for that when adding the bag. 

Another requirement is that I want to be able to remove the speed bag appendage when I want to use the tower.

Ideas? Probably a weird request, I know, but I really appreciate any help. </TEXT>
