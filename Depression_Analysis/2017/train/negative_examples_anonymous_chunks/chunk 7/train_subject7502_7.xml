	<TEXT> Looking for a place to rent (open to renting it for the night if not just for a few hours) for a party with about 40 friends. It can either be a room or a house or whatever else, I'm open to options!

Not really interested in a private room in a restaurant because my friends can get kind of rowdy.. something private that we can decorate/clean/manage on our own without owner interference would be the best!

Any ideas? I'm willing to spend up to $200! Thanks in advance :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hello! If you are a male and you like to sing, you should think about auditioning for Dallas' only competitive South Asian a cappella team this coming Wednesday, Jan. 21st! For more information, check out the [fb event here](https://www.facebook.com/events/919252438098475/?notif_t=plan_user_joined)

Edit: You can find our recently released single [here](https://soundcloud.com/dhunkimusic/royals-dil-se-re) and check out some our live performances [here](https://www.youtube.com/user/DhunkiMusic) - and just as a note, the live performances on our YouTube channel, except for the 2 most recent ones, are extremely outdated and we have almost an entirely new team and have made a LOT of progress since then!!   </TEXT>
