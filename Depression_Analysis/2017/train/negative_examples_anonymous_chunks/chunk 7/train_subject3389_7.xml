	<TEXT> To use a hypothetical example, say that Myanmar finds its crops are suffering from heat-related blight and drought, so it decides to spend a paltry $10 billion (Weitzman's estimate) to spew sulfates into the air, reducing global temperatures by a half-degree Celsius, improving its crop health and making its dictator more popular. Meanwhile, those sulfates become acid rain falling downwind all over neighboring India and Bhutan, destroying forests there, while the lower global temperature also causes crop failures in Canada and the Nordic countries. How do India, Bhutan, Canada and Sweden then recover from Myanmar? The military dictator there knows he has more to gain from popularity at home than he has to lose from a bunch of pissed off far-flung foreigners. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The IMF has done extensive studies on both positives and negatives of warming, like [this paper.](https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2008/03/pdf/cline.pdf) Those findings are generally included in more recent reports. Unfortunately, where agriculture is concerned, the news isn't great. Warmer winters in Canada don't compensate for larger crop failures in the subtropics and tropics, where more than half of the world's people live.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks for the nice reply, but, as the study says, in most cases these costs are born by local populations exposed to local pollution, which suggests greater accountability. The study identifies global climate damages as only about one quarter of the costs, while the rest are primarily localized effects of pollution.

It's just that those local populations happen to be concentrated in the developing world, particularly Asia, where recovering for such damages is nearly impossible. The basic trouble isn't how you or I define accountability or subsidy, but how courts do--and that varies tremendously by jurisdiction. This is less an economic matter than a legal one.

The IMF paper here simply identifies the costs, which, it seems to me, is as far as economics can go with this. Rather than quibbling over economics textbook definitions of subsidies, the real issue is how to enforce accountability in poor places with corrupt governance. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Because insurance wouldn't pay out without a successful lawsuit in most of these cases, and most of the damages are in countries where that would be impossible. How does a resident of Guangzhou sue a factory or power plant for the death of an asthmatic child when there are so many factories and power plants spewing pollutants there? Which one was responsible? And how can the plaintiff win in a country with so many legal obstacles?

Even Union Carbide's killing of thousands in Bhopal resulted in nothing more than a modest judgement that hasn't begun to cover the costs there, where it was vastly easier to quantify damages and assign blame.  </TEXT>

No, most of the [$550 billion](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2014/11/12/renewables-are-replacing-coal-just-not-fast-enough-to-save-the-planet/) in annual direct handouts to fossil fuel companies are consumption subsidies and production subsidies, and they are pervasive worldwide. 

The *indirect* subsidies--the externalities detailed in this paper--are predominantly localized effects of air and water pollution, especially on health costs, and most of those are in developing countries. See the graphs here:

	<TEXT> Sorry about the paywall. Here is the text:

WASHINGTONConsumers should be paying a whopping $5 trillion more a year for energy to cover the hidden health and environmental costs of using fossil fuels, the International Monetary Fund said Monday.

Vitor Gaspar, head of the IMFs fiscal affairs department, which produced the report, called the estimates shocking and one of the largest negative externalities ever estimated, referring to costs that arent factored into prices.

The fund said policy makers must start capturing those costsvalued at roughly 6% of global gross domestic productin fuel prices now to curb the damaging effects, encourage greater energy efficiency and prevent a mounting toll on human health.

The report said the costslargely fueled by the ballooning use of coal in China and Indiafar surpassed the savings gleaned in the past year as governments cut traditional energy subsidies.

Falling oil prices have given governments including India and Angola an opportunity to raise energy prices closer to their market values.

Cutting subsidies relieves a burden on state budgets and allows a government to channel revenue elsewhere, such as social services, health care or growth-spurring investments.

International Monetary Fund Fiscal Affairs Department Director Vitor Gaspar called a report on the hidden health and environmental costs of fossil fuel use shocking.
International Monetary Fund Fiscal Affairs Department Director Vitor Gaspar called a report on the hidden health and environmental costs of fossil fuel use shocking. 

But the IMF said the uncounted costs of pollution from coal, oil and natural gas also should be considered subsidies because economies are burdened with mounting costs resulting from their use. Based in part on new World Health Organization data, the fund estimates those post-tax subsidies will hit $5.3 trillion this year alone.

Around a quarter of that covers the theoretical cost of mitigating greenhouse-gas emissions.

The rest is from the health effects of local pollution as well as from traffic congestion, accidents and road damage.

It is important to put in perspective just how many health problems are linked to energy consumption and air quality, said Benedict Clements, a division chief in the IMFs fiscal affairs department.

For example, the WHO estimates more than one million premature deaths a year occur because of outdoor air pollution caused largely by burning coal, he said.

IMF economists acknowledge the figures are disputable, but say they provide some indication of hidden costs that should provoke debate.

They also accept that eliminating subsides by raising energy taxes would be costly for consumers, and so it recommends a gradual increase.

Moving to efficient energy pricing in one step would require very large increases in consumer energy prices, in particular for coal, with a global average price increase of more than 200 percent, the IMF warned.

Although higher energy prices generally tax an economys growth prospects, the fund said governments can use the increase in revenue to foster economic expansion, such as through cutting labor and corporate taxes, infrastructure investment and spending on education.

It also would create incentives for low-emission alternative energy.

The fiscal gains from subsidy reform are sizable and could be a game changer for fiscal policy in many countries, Mr. Clements said. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Both. Fossil fuel companies get at least $550 in direct handouts each year, and very likely much more, but the price gets into the trillions when one adds the costs of health care, infrastructure and environmental damage. I don't know if this also includes the military costs of defending oil fields, transport routes and the like, but, if not, that would push the value of these subsidies still higher.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's much more localized than that, as Bishop and Cushing detail in *The Big Sort*. Over the past fifty years, Americans have moved increasingly to be among people like themselves: lefties in cities and righties in rural counties, with individual suburbs falling heavily one way or the other, so that now most US counties are political "landslide counties" where one party completely rules. 

And, yes, that leads to violence: think of the attacks in Oklahoma City, Atlanta, Knoxville, Austin, Wichita, Spokane, Las Vegas, etc.. Notice that these places tend to be "border towns" where rural, right-wing extremists are in close proximity to small cities, which they assault whenever they see a hint of "tyranny" (a Federal office building, a Unitarian Church, a family planning clinic, a Martin Luther King Day parade, a Sikh temple, a liberal radio host, a couple of cops eating lunch...).  So one could say that we already have something of a low-grade civil war under way. We do indeed hate each other that much, sorry to say, and we've moved into opposing enclaves because of it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The studies this article cites are merely a few of many, like [this one](http://www.uspirg.org/reports/usp/do-roads-pay-themselves), that show that tax money flows entirely the other way: from general funds to roads. Fuel taxes have never really paid for the roads alone. Forty years ago they paid *most* of the cost, but no longer. Now they pay less than half.  

Add the fact that vastly more road damage comes from trucks, and it's clear that road maintenance is essentially a gigantic taxpayer handout to trucking companies. Then add the social cost of driving (carbon pollution, injuries, respiratory ailments, etc.) which is in the trillions, and we can see just how much road construction really costs us. Bikes, on the other hand, cause almost no road wear and they actually reduce health costs.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Perceptions are not a useful test for reality.

I was just addressing Wumbotarian's question about the perceived value of employee benefits. 

penetration rates have been declining for some time

And deductibles are not rising? Elective choices aren't shrinking? Let's face it: health insurance may be more costly, but it isn't adding extra value to compensation. 

All these points are wrong; The value of retirement plans offered by employers is not declining...DB as proportion of plans offered has been stable for the last decade.

In 1979, [38 percent](http://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/ssb/v69n3/v69n3p1.html) of private sector employees in the United States had a Defined Benefit Pension Plan. By 2011, the number had dropped to 14 percent. That isn't a decline?

What makes 401's crap?

Oh, maybe the fact that they plainly aren't working, with only the well-off being able to save sufficiently? Or the fact that they shift market risk onto employees? Or that promised employer matches are vanishing, leaving employees even less able to save? Or how about the simple truth that 401(k) plans were sold to employees as *supplements* to pensions, but then turned out to be mere stalking horses for the killing of those pension plans? Or perhaps the plain fact that voluntary saving for retirement never has worked before, and probably never will? We now have tens of millions of workers headed for old age with almost nothing to sustain them. To call that a kick in the teeth is a vast understatement, but what would you call it?

 [Day care has been] 7% of family income since the 70's.

[Wrong.](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/04/08/rising-cost-of-child-care-may-help-explain-increase-in-stay-at-home-moms/)

 The college premium has risen faster then the cost of college.

[Wrong again.](http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-CU892_paydeb_G_20140515160642.jpg)

i'm not sure under what basis you can claim "many" folks are not better off.

See above.

	<TEXT> Look at participation rates or labor force share: both show a rising trend over the period. Women definitely continued to enter the labor force in larger numbers well after 1980. 

More importantly, women now [*make far more money*](http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/files/2013/12/SDT-gender-and-work-12-2013-0-03.png), which greatly amplifies the effect of their growing numbers in the workforce. That further disqualifies the use of overall household income as a point of comparison.

So why does the Booth School use such a bogus measure? Because it's the Booth School, of course. They have a conservative business agenda at stake. You're right: this *is* basic stuff. </TEXT>

1972: 38%

2014: 47% 

What's more, women have moved into [much higher income employment](http://dpeaflcio.org/professionals/professionals-in-the-workplace/women-in-the-professional-and-technical-labor-force/) than they used to occupy, further skewing household income as a point of comparison. As "Creamyturtle" says, this obscures the fact that wages have been stagnant and men have seen real wage declines.

	<TEXT> [This](http://www.gallup.com/poll/1720/work-work-place.aspx) may provide some insights. Declining health and retirement benefits are the chief complaints among employees. 

Yes, the employer's cost for health benefits is rising, but the perceived value to employees is *falling*: we all face higher deductibles, we're all being pushed into HMOs with fewer elective options, etc..

The retirement benefits picture is even worse. Defined benefit plans are vanishing altogether, being replaced with lousy 401(k) plans, and even the employer matches for those are disappearing.

Add the sky-high cost of daycare for children of working parents, and the skyrocketing cost of college for one's kids, and it's safe to say that many folks are *not* better off, no matter how much they may enjoy playing Angry Birds on their phones. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> First, household income is a poor point of comparison due to the rise of two-income households over this period; this hides overall stagnation in wages, and declines among men. Median wages would be a better measure.

Second, inequality has gone through the roof, followed by the financial elite committing gigantic debt fraud and extorting massive taxpayer bailouts, which leaves most Americans feeling very, very screwed. Trends in perceived wealth and income *always* relate to the general sense of fairness in the system, which, it's fair to say, is now deep in the toilet. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> From the article: 

"In March, he released a new policy brief, "The Conservative Case for a Carbon Tax," which argues for a steadily rising "revenue-neutral" fee on fossil fuel producers. Aside from a small portion set aside to cushion low-income households, all the revenue would be devoted to reducing other taxes. Taylor has in mind a deal that would impose a carbon tax in exchange for the removal of other climate regulations, notably EPA carbon rules and state renewable energy mandates.

Taylor is one of several renegade Cato/Heartland regulars who have spent several years beating the drum for a carbon tax as a means to cut progressive taxes on the wealthy--mostly the corporate income tax--as well as to hobble the EPA.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Actually, it sounds like he's pushing for a carbon tax "in exchange for liberals agreeing to cut other corporate taxes and eliminate federal fuel standards and greenhouse-gas regulations".

Sure, Taylor's position is "cut corporate taxes and regulations and then we'll talk". Given that corporate ownership is heavily in the hands of the wealthy, this is a clear ploy to benefit those wealthy shareholders--who happen to keep Jerry Taylor in luxury. That's the *only* reason why Jerry is interested in cutting corporate taxes and regulations. 

George Shultz is a much more worthy spokesman, precisely because he is *not* making his support of carbon taxation conditional on handouts to the wealthy at the expense of everyone else. Shultz advocates for fee-and-dividend while Taylor only wants tax and regulatory cuts for his rich sponsors. That is a very major difference.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes, but Taylor isn't arguing for a fee-and-dividend approach, which would counteract the regressivity of a sales tax on fuels. Instead, he would use the revenues to cut taxes on the wealthy, leaving lower and middle income people to shoulder more of the overall tax burden.

He isn't alone in this. A [growing number of conservatives](http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/how-to-tax-carbon/) are beginning to see the need to price carbon as a chance to extort lucrative favors for their wealthy benefactors. Essentially, they've realized that they are losing the fight to ignore the climate mess, so now they are demanding payment for cooperation: "I'll support a carbon price, but only if you pay me while sticking it to everyone else".  </TEXT>

That paper, in particular, showed that the coal reserves in the Powder River basin in the West and the oil in Canadas tar sands had to be left largely untouched, and that there was no climate-friendly scenario in which any oil or gas could be drilled in the Arctic.

And yet Mr. Obama  acting on his own, since these are all executive actions requiring nothing from Congress  has opened huge swaths of the Powder River basin to new coal mining. Hes still studying whether to approve the Keystone XL pipeline, though the countrys leading climate scientists have all told him it would be a disaster. And now hes given Shell the green light [in the Arctic].

In other words, Obama caved in to the oilcos despite pleas from scientists to ban Arctic offshore drilling, completely contradicting his professed concern for the scientific consensus on climate, which says we have only a few precious decades to quit fossil fuels altogether.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  First, the vast majority of Americans get their TV through cable

The "vast majority"? No, just [slightly more than half](http://www.tvnewscheck.com/article/47812/cable-penetration-hits-21year-low).

Second, CNBC has several liberal commentators.

Heh. As fiercely liberal as Santelli and Kudlow are stridently conservative? Are you sure you want to go there? 

you completely ignored, ABC, CBS, NBC, and PBS.

No, I simply pointed out that none of those have a dedicated political following as Fox does. And, for all the conservative crap about whether Scott Pelley or Ann Curry is more likely to raise a left eyebrow while delivering a conservative political story, it's just that: crap.

Yeah, liberals watch PBS, but not often for politics: its big shows are Downton Abbey, Nova, Sesame Street, Ken Burns docs and--saints preserve us--Celtic Fire. Its news is radically vanilla. Moyers is the only show I can think of that's truly leftist, and he gets just a single late hour a week (if that; many affiliates refuse to air him). Most importantly, the PBS audience is small, ranking well behind all commercial networks, including Fox. Only Fox is all politics, all the time, all over the place, and all from one heavily slanted point of view. 

just about every major newspaper, and thus their online newspaper as well, is biased to the left.

You must not be familiar with the Chicago Tribune, The Wall Street Journal or many of the other conservative rags that populate the US landscape (yet in shrinking numbers, like liberal papers, because, as I say, newspapers no longer count for much). 

And radio? It's huge and growing, and the whole medium is incredibly, one-sidedly political. It's also an especially popular medium in the rural and suburban areas where more conservatives live, and among heavy drivers, which conservatives tend to be. In my town we have no less than five rabidly, hatefully conservative stations without a single voice from the other side, and that's rather typical. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Nope, "Funky Groove" is pretty accurate in hard numbers terms. Those unbothered by rising inequality are overwhelmingly conservative, and conservatives have been steadily inflamed since the legalization of one-sided political television and radio networks after the 1987 shredding of the FCC fairness Doctrine. Yes, this allowed the rise of a few weak, underfunded liberal counterparts like MSNBC, but they lack anything close to the money and reach of News Corp ($67 billion market cap) or Clear Channel ($4 billion). For example, MSNBC features only 8 hours of political programming daily while Fox News's is 24/7; MSNBC is available only on cable while Fox News is both cable and broadcast; MSNBC is available on only some cable systems while Fox News is on nearly all; MSNBC is difficult to find beyond the US while Fox News is global; MSNBC's parent corporation, Comcast, also owns stridently conservative CNBC (Santelli, Kudlow, etc.) while Fox News's parent corporation is Rupert Murdoch's personal, conservative crusade. And so on. It's not too much to say that the United States is now ripped in two, with a third of Americans (older, Christian, rural/suburban) making right-wing political venom the primary ingredient in their media diet while the rest of the country more or less ignores politics.

	<TEXT> Your first questions you can easily answer with a few searches, so I'll attempt to tackle the last. 

How long will global warming continue if we stop carbon pollution today? The answer is generally [a few centuries](http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2005/03/how-long-will-global-warming-last/), but no one really knows because we don't fully understand the role of feedbacks that may continue to release carbon from natural stores like forests, peatlands, tundra and seafloor methane hydrates. Based on paleoclimate data, there appear to be tipping points at which these feedbacks could even accelerate warming into a runaway excursion that may take millennia to subside, but, again, we don't know where those tipping points are, hence the global agreement that 2C warming is the most we can reasonably, somewhat safely tolerate (and many leading lights warn even that is too risky). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Paywalled. Here is text:

Even as oil rallies back above $60 a barrel, obituaries are being drafted. Oil majors face questions from shareholders concerned the threat of climate change means some of the reserves underpinning the companies will never be produced. In a recent report, HSBC urged investors to plan for this risk of stranded assets.

The risk is realand doesnt just boil down to efforts to curb climate change.

One warning: Saudi Arabias decision to keep pumping despite the drop in oil prices. Apart from taking market share back from higher-cost rivals, the countrys oil minister has indicated concern about long-term demand in the face of technological and regulatory threats.

Almost 1,400 climate policies had been enacted globally by 2013, according to the International Energy Agency, up from less than 200 in 2005. Meanwhile, although electric vehicles remain a tiny part of the global car market, they have grown phenomenally from virtually zero only five years ago.

One argument against such concerns is that oil-company valuations largely reflect the value of proven oil-and-gas reserves, likely to be produced before any serious disruptions happen.

Such thinking only holds, though, if you assume future cash flows will be distributed rather than reinvested. That is plainly not the industrys way. In the past decade, Exxon Mobil, Royal Dutch Shell and Chevron collectively reinvested 66% of operating cash flow, according to data from S P Capital IQ; buybacks and dividends equated to just 46%. Reporting first-quarter numbers last week, Exxon and Shell barely covered capital expenditure with cash from operations while Chevrons free cash flow was sharply negative.

In addition, more than half the last decades capital expenditure was spent post-2010. While producers test project economics under different scenarios, much of that investment was made at a time of triple-digit prices and the sector was clearly blindsided by oils collapse.

The dynamics of this drop, coming amid a massive investment boom, bring the threat of stranded assets much closer to today. Surveying 37 large oil companies, Citigroup estimates as much as 40% of the current investment cycleabout $1.4 trillionmay have gone into or be going into projects that struggle to generate acceptable returns at oil prices below $75 a barrel. Oil sands and liquefied natural gas projectswhich require large upfront investments and long schedules before generating positive cash flowslook especially exposed. Right now, Brent crude futures for the next five years average about $74 a barrel.

Ultimately, the mismatch between those prices and project economics set up another cycle of investment falling, supply tightening, and prices rising again. But in this cycle, there are two added risks.

First, the shale boom, which helped generate the excess supply weighing on prices today, represents a deflationary force. Productivity gains have reduced break-even prices for U.S. oil output, making some shale basins more competitive than traditional sources such as the Gulf of Mexico, the North Sea and Russia. And the recent rally on signs of U.S. production flattening out also enables exploration and production firms to finance future drilling.

Second, Saudi Arabias decision to prioritize market share is also deflationary. If Riyadh is genuinely worried about increasing regulatory and technological curbs on long-term oil demand, it has an incentive to keep pumping at high rates. Cheaper oil helps to deter or delay efforts to limit consumption. More important, if you produce a commodity and suspect its days may be numbered, then it is far better to get as much out of the ground now rather than wait.

This is the dilemma in which Big Oil finds itself. Having sunk billions into the ground in recent years, several majors are banking on a rebound to triple-digit oil soon. Such an outcome would offer relief initially. But it would also enable rival supply from shale producers with much shorter production cycles and spur greater efforts to make Saudi Arabias deepest fear a reality. Oil demand doesnt have to disappear altogether to leave a producer with stranded assets; they can just be sitting on uncompetitive ones. </TEXT>

The last time atmospheric CO2 exceeded 1000 ppm, 56 million years ago during the [Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PaleoceneEocene_Thermal_Maximum), the climate cooked by 6C and species changed dramatically, including a mass extinction in the oceans. Sea levels rose hundreds of feet, the oceans turned acidic and semi-putrid, storms were horrendous. And that was during a warming that occurred over tens of thousands of years, when life had time to adapt. Today, we are on our way to reproducing these effects many, many times faster. </TEXT>

Agreed, a diploma is no guarantee of a career, but most smart young Americans of middling means reasonably see their choices as: A) A costly degree that *probably* leads to a good job and social status; B) Military service that *certainly* means personal debasement, physical hardship and celebration of violence, or C) A long struggle in limbo as a low-wage earner trying to train for something--anything--better. Given that choice, should we be surprised that most at least try to choose Option A? </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  We've beating it into people that you need to go to college to make a decent living. 

In the US, one *does* need to go to college to make a decent living. That's the driver here. The cry for public assistance follows. I admit, it's a chicken-or-egg problem, but the root cause has to be the undeniable *need* for a diploma to get most middle class jobs now.

 Trade schools and apprenticeships are good too.

Rarely. The US lacks three things that other nations depend upon to educate most workers: 1) Free, high-quality, universal trade schooling that begins in high school and continues beyond; 2) A dependable track to employment for trade school grads; 3) Job security and benefits for skilled labor.

For all intents and purposes, the US military is the nation's technical school, but it's a poor one, never mind the outrageous inequity of telling the poorer half of young people to go dodge IEDs in occupied countries if they ever want a decent job. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Great comments from others here. I'll just add that I think it unlikely that future tax changes are much of a threat. Installing more solar is a state, national and global priority that will only grow stronger, and California has a huge number of existing solar customers who won't stand for being reamed. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Nothing new here. Let's face it: religion itself has been the leading cause of tribalism and violence since humans emerged from Africa, exterminating long-established populations of Neanderthals, Denisovans and likely other near-human strains across Eurasia. Every effort to move beyond that bloody history runs into yet another backward band of tribal, religious agitators. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> NYC may be the greenest central city, but it actually ranks number four among American metro areas for lowest per capita carbon emissions, although metrics are tricky, as [this list](http://news.mongabay.com/2008/0530-footprint.html) shows. 

Not surprising to see Honolulu number one, due to its density as well as its low needs for heating and cooling buildings.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> And this is what makes arguing with an entrenched cynic like *you* pointless. Even your example table shows the nat gas share of generation slumping over the next two decades while renewables increase. This is from the highly conservative, fossil fueled EIA.

As for their longer-term contention that fossil fuel use--especially coal--will remain steady into midcentury, fuggedaboudit. Climate reality is biting us all, even the carbon bureaucrats at the EIA.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> "Coal and natural gas (both fossil fuels) are just as important in power generation in 2015 as they ever have been"

[Check again.](http://www.eia.gov/forecasts/steo/images/Fig25.png) Coal has fallen from 55% of total US generation to 36% today, and it's now dropping faster. Gas picked up most of the slack, but its share is forecast by the EIA to begin dropping now as renewables take up more of the total. Nuclear's share will grow soon after.

One needn't be a starry-eyed idealist to realize that when the entire world scientific community unites to warn that all fossil fuel burning must end within our lifetimes, that inevitably means trouble for fossil fuel companies.  </TEXT>

The MSCI and Aperio studies merely show that a slight but steady delta is opening, suggesting that just generally avoiding fossil fuel companies is profitable in itself, not to mention more morally conscionable.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  They'll be the ones buying up renewable firms/developing their own renewables once it becomes profitable to do so. 

The few oilcos that tried diversifying into renewable energy have all backed away, often after locking up patents that could threaten their core business. 

Coal is now a dead man walking, and oil is next. That doesn't mean that overweighting solar is smart; it merely means that staying with fossil fuels is stupid (not to mention destructive). </TEXT>
