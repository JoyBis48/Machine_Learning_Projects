I don't mean to be offensive but I just can't seem to understand the line of thinking behind the view. 

Feedom of expression exists for the things we don't like, the ones we like don't need protection. I'm personally against any type of hijab but I realize that it's just not my call to make. It's their body and they should be able to decide what to wear. I just simply don't understand how people who say they stand for freedom want to ban certain types of clothing from some events.

	<TEXT> I'm getting more and more into Canadian politics and some popularly held views I come across are very strange for me, one of which being the whole niqab-while-taking-citizenship-oaths thing. I don't mean to be offensive but I just can't seem to understand the line of thinking behind the view. 

Feedom of expression exists for the things we don't like, the ones we like don't need protection. I'm personally against any type of hijab but I realize that it's just not my call to make. It's their body and they should be able to decide what to wear. I just simply don't understand how people who say they stand for freedom want to ban certain types of clothing from some events. 

Thanks! </TEXT>

The Over-policing of Dominican Hair
Just recently, Morgan Miller published an article for American Quarterly, decrying her experience as an African-American woman with natural hair in the Dominican Republic. Morgan traveled to the Dominican Republic expecting a respite from the racism she experienced in her native United States. She arrived in a poor tropical island fully unaware of her own country's imposition of a political pigmentocracy vis--vis their training and backing of dictator Rafael Trujillo. 

Robert Crassweller in Trujillo: The Life and Times of a Caribbean Dictator writes of racial relations before Trujillo's rise to power. Crassweller stresses that in the Dominican Republic, the color line barely existed (149). A preference for good hair was the limit of racial awareness and indeed it was not unusual for a very dark man to be successful and receive full public acceptance in the highest circles of public life. Crassweller further adds that the ancient hostilities between the Dominican Republic and Haiti were national and public, not private and personal. Trujillo, whose own grandmother was Haitian, found it more convenient to antagonize the two peoples in order to pose as the savior of one. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Seeking Refuge

"Now that Bitcoin exists, we hope that Greek workers and merchants can use it to protect their income through this crisis."
- BitPay business development manager Pablo Magro.
To fight inflation, Latin Americans have historically stored their wealth in American dollars. The increasing restrictions some countries have placed on buying dollars have left these citizens financially vulnerable.

In Argentina, even though government restrictions were somewhat relaxed after the peso experienced a sudden drop in value in 2014, those who are approved to buy dollars are limited to purchasing just 20% of their income, capping their monthly savings at $2,000.

Getting this approval is a cumbersome process, leaving most Argentines with a higher restriction barrier to exchange their local currency. However, the numbers are rising from $39.2m p/day bought in June to $60m p/day bought in July, forcing the government to tighten the restrictions.

Extreme restrictions on currency exchange have led to the emergence of a black market specifically for trading pesos for dlar blue, American dollars with an exchange rate that runs about 50% higher than the official exchange rate.

Acquiring dollars this way is illegal and risky, so Argentines seeking to protect their savings often buy ADRs (American Depository Receipts), local bonds denominated in dollars, gold, silver, and other commodities that are traded on local and international stock exchanges.

No Bank Account? No Problem.

News of bank closures in Greece in the past month have sparked panic, then bank runs, leaving many Greek citizens without regular access to their bank accounts.

For Latin Americans, this situation is already too familiar. Among Latin America's 600 million inhabitants, more than 60% are unbanked, meaning they have no access to bank accounts.

Despite the obvious economic need, most financial institutions are unable to serve this unbanked population.

Fortunately, purchasing and using bitcoin does not require a bank account. All it takes is just a mobile phone, which 70% of Latin Americans happen to have. In contrast to the banking system, the Bitcoin network operates 24 hours a day, every day of the year, and can be accessed by anyone on the internet. It presents an immediate, accessible solution to receive wages and securely store savings at very low cost, with no additional resources or hardware required.

Entrepreneurs and companies have already begun to make bitcoin solutions available to consumers in the region. Belize's Advanced Cash is particularly significant example, accepting bitcoin payments for top-ups to its popular digital wallets and prepaid cards which are used throughout Latin America. This mainstream integration of bitcoin payments is allowing both banked and unbanked customers to secure their savings in the cloud. </TEXT>
