	<TEXT> I think it is you being afraid to step out of your comfort zone. You are only doing what you know and are used to. When ever you feel like quitting, think about why you started or how it will make you feel or benefit you when you finish. I suggest stepping out of your comfort zone slowly. Try not to overwhelm yourself. Set attainable goals and build of off that! You got this! </TEXT>
