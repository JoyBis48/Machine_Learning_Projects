	<TEXT> Since you're a vet, I highly recommend you contact the Red Cross in SLC and reach their veteran mentoring division. They might have a list of vet friendly companies that could be hiring now. And if you fall on hard times, they can definitely put you in touch with the right people (VA, VSOs, etc).

I work for said division in Provo, so feel free to PM me :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I work with vets. Best advice: learn their stories, be mindful, and don't get upset when they disagree with you. Many of these servicemen have be mishandled by the military or the government (and in the case of the US, the VA). 

To bring them to the ideas of statelessness, connect their ideas of patriotism (if they are patriots) and steer that towards a love not just of their own country, but for a love of all mankind.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The US government is the most well armed force on the planet. To take on such a foe would require a great amount of strength, and an even greater amount of sympathy from those within the ranks of the Feds (military, politicians, DEA, FBI, etc). Local police forces would also have to be convinced to join the site of the rebels rather than the side that funds their pensions. 

The US, being so large and diverse, would also have to find some unifying factor for rebels to be supported by a grand majority. This factor would bring together conservatives, progressives, radicals, and the apolitical alike. 

Such a rebellion would also have to be very well organized, or so popular that so many come on board the cause that taking on the US military could possibility result in victory. 

Be mindful that if we're talking civilian versus army, these means that it's guns versus tanks, fighters, war ships, and missiles.  

So, a rebellion could take place, but a successful one would be hard to come by.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You could try Americorps VISTA or one of their other programs.  After serving with them you become eligible for an education award (the amount depends on your length of service, which can generally go up to a year). I'm actually with Americorps myself, and after a few months of part time work I'll be eligible for a $2k education award. If I served a full year, that number would be about $5k. 

Or find a company that does tuition reimbursement.  </TEXT>

According to the author, Jeb Bush has a staunch history of being an active conservative governor on things like education and the Second Amendment, yet Republicans seem to often ignore this, either due to ignorance, or his "non-conservative" stances on immigration and Common Core. The article shows how tough Bush will have it come 2016. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For VISTA, you will definitely become poor, and you will grow to embrace it (unless you have a killer amount of savings in your bank). My stipend was $900/mo, and rent was about $400/mo, which gave me $500 to things like food, clothing, and entertainment. Wasn't terribly hard to live by, but it was a struggle on occasion.

Also, if you're a first year VISTA like I was (NGOs can host a VISTA up to three consecutive years), you'll be breaking ground for the organization, so expect some bumps along the way. </TEXT>
