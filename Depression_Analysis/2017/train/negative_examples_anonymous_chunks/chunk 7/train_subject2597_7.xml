	<TEXT> Completely unbiased here. 
The Nebraska common opponent doesn't work here. CU played in Lincoln, GT played neutral field. 
I'll keep my overall argument simple, all voters knew about the 5th down and clipping call. That is the biggest arguments against Colorado but don't hold much ground when voters knew about it. Colorado only lost the coaches poll by 1 vote. They won the AP by very many votes. Colorado had a harder SOS as many other people here will discuss. If we emphasize conference play then Colorado wins at a perfect record where as GT tied North Carolina. 

Edit- for SOS Colorado played 7 rated opponents to GT's 3.  </TEXT>

We completely out gained ASU, multiple overtime against Cal, would have won against UCLA if sefo spiked the ball at the end of the first half but instead lost in over time. We have 4-5 games decided by one possession.

	<TEXT> Having a female kicker.
She's not on the team, no accusations of harassment. No crackdown by the administration on recruiting rules. Colorado still relevant. 

Edit- anyone downvoting is lying if they think a female football player would benefit the team.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Bikers should always be cautious regardless of who's in the right because getting hit by a car hurts. 
Most bikers I see at night have no lighting or reflective gear. Cops don't enforce the law of needing lights. 
I don't hate bikers although it's probably coming off that way, I just don't think this solution will work unless you get a huge amount of drivers to start biking.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I found it interesting the Bucks' worth doubled after going from worst team to NBA team, regardless of the conspiracy theory listed in the article. 
Milwaukee and Wisconsin have a choice, build a new stadium to keep the bucks, possibly get an NHL team, and modernize Milwaukee. Or let the bucks leave and NBA owners profit off the $1 billion deal and lose and Milwaukee Bucks related revenue. The revenue will increase greatly over the next few years. The bucks have a lot of young talent. They can sustain success and get the city excited about something.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Meanwhile the bucks have playoff team with an average age in the mid 20s. 
NHL is considering Milwaukee for an NHL team. 
A new stadium would do nothing but good for Milwaukee. Everyone is way too focused on the bucks. It's ok to fund a baseball stadium for a shitty team but funding a facility for diverse entertainment is a no go. There's a reason Milwaukee and Wisconsin are behind, everyone is stuck in the past and resistant to any modernization  </TEXT>

[Tickets to the rooftop sold out in hours] (http://bsndenver.com/around-the-herd-7715-shouting-from-the-rooftop/) 

I was hoping the review would be something more along the lines of it being hard to breathe, and not because of excitement 

Edit- not a one star review but I enjoyed this one
