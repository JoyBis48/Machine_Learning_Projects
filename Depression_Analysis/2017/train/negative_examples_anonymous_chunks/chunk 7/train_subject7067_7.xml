	<TEXT> Wow that's crazy, the dark hair on hair made my boner for her even harder, as a blonde i find her closer to natalie's scale of attractiveness, which is only a few notches below dark-hair emilia.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Used to love Coke, then high-school buddy got diabetes, could only drink Diet Coke, and ever since I became a Diet Coke drinker, I LOVE the taste.  I'm sure there were better ways, but a nice Diet Coke was a great way to keep my ass going to the gym and dieting properly.  I guess I used it as a tiny reward, although I can say anecdotally that Diet Coke probably does more harm to my body than good, it's just what my body tells me. 

Doesn't matter if I'm in skinny or chubby mode, Diet Coke all day every day, I'll probably get cancer. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I had just started watching the lakers, it was fun to see him play, but they never made it over the hump; too young to understand much.  Although something neat happened, I made a pretty stupid move trading away a michael jordan north carolina rookie card for some shiny nick van exel card... </TEXT>
