	<TEXT> She has a good personality, she also feels extremely bad. We have been together almost 4 years now. And yes I told her she is not allowed to drive them anymore for my own reasons mainly and insurance reasons. And you're correct "petite and pretty" has nothing to do with it. The reason I said "petite and pretty" was to give my pissed off brain something good to picture instead of anger towards her. It was an accident but one that kills me a little inside. </TEXT>
