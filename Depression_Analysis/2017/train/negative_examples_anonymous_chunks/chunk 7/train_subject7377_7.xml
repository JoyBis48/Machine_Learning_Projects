	<TEXT> I'm vegetarian and I'm particularly fond of kangaroos, they're beautiful animals, the thought of them being hunted often upsets me. But this company actually seems really good,  if kangaroos must be hunted I'd support them. I've seen and heard too many stories about shooters wounding and not killing and the killing of joeys is awful. 

I'm glad there are good ethical hunters out there.  </TEXT>

I was incredibly depressed, the job was soul crushing retail and i was starting to seriously consider seriously injuring myself so i could have a legitimate reason to not go into work.  

So i drove 6 hours back to my parents house instead of going to work one morning.  I regret nothing. It all ended ok </TEXT>

It sounds kind of harsh, but it's what friends are for, for venting to and joking with, nothing malicious is meant by what we say.
