	<TEXT> Most states require you to take a teacher certification exam like the praxis and they typically require you to complete a student teaching semester/s. 

Just curious, why do you want to become a teacher? (The degree that you have is not as important as your passion for teaching and your passion for your students)

If you haven't taken any education classes I would recommend doing some reading on teaching, observe some classrooms, talk to an expert teacher etc. Make sure that you want to be a teacher of students first and a teacher of your content second. </TEXT>
