	<TEXT> I think you already made the first good step: you *moved* to another division. 

I don't want to be too judgmental, but my warning bells are ringing... we INFP's are quite easily accessible for manipulative persons, that seem to be nice and caring, but you're just another marionette for them... since you said she's doing it in a subtle way and also to other people, she might have a narcissistic tendency..  

Hopefully, that distance you already created will help you to find emotional distance, so that you can think about it a bit clearer...

Just my two cents.. I hope it helped you a bit to find the right path. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> maybe it's true, that someone has more friends then you, or has accomplished more. but does that mean, you're not as equally great as anyone else in your OWN way? does that mean, your life can't still be fabulous? :)

	<TEXT> Hi! *wink* same goes for me. I need to *feel* safe with a person. If my intuition says it's not right, then there's always a reason for that. So better not force anything when being at this point.. I rather try to figure out, why I feel this way.
Other than that mentioned, having high expectations in a person or even in love, is never the right approach in my opinion... no one should have the feeling, they are not enough. They should know, that they are great the way they are. And love comes whenever it wants anyway with different reasons, so I limited down my expectations to two "key-questions": is the person treating me respectfully/genuinely? can I trust him? When these two things are given, hopefully time will show the other great different qualities the person has. Whichever they might be. :)  </TEXT>
