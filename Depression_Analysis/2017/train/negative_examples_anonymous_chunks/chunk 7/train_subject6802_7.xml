	<TEXT> Women get their labia cut off and sewn up, making sex extremely painful, and oh yeah sometimes die in childbirth because of it too. Some dudes are unhappy because someone said they can't fully appreciate sex because they are circumcised. No one is actually sure this is true because they don't know what it feels like to have sex uncircumcised. Clearly these two issues are exactly the same. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Agent Provocateur lingerie. Bought a set that was on sale but still heavily overpriced. Wore it less than a handful of times and washed it cold, by hand, as specified on the label. Literally disintegrated after that. Apparently they started manufacturing in China but kept their pricing... There's a lot of unsatisfied customers on their FB page... </TEXT>
