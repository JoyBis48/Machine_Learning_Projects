	<TEXT> Your head isn't the real world. I know what you mean by tower. compare a full size tower pc to a mac pro, you gotta admit they're different. I'm talking about aesthetics. Sure both are desktop computers. We're talking the same thing but we're not understanding each other. Go ahead with a MacPro, it can handle 3 4k displays, you won't regret it. </TEXT>
