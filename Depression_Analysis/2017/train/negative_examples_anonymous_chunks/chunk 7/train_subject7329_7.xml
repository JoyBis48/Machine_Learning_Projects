	<TEXT> Ok awesome thanks for the good info and quick response! Would you see any interaction between the 'done and this?  Based on what I told you, you would recommend the Bali?  Also how many mg's should I dose at first time I try?  Sorry for all the questions- i've known of kratom for about a year but I am still a bit hesitant to try it mainly because I read to many things on the net comparing it to bath salts and the like so I kinda scared myself haha. thanks again bud!!

	<TEXT> Where can you get kratom in the states? At a headshop type place or  you think they would just call me a junkie and say F off haha. What kinds/brands are good? I have heard that the capsules are crappy.  How much should I try for never having tried it before?  Also I am on Methadone so I don't even know if I should try it since I am on it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> well for what it's worth, the past few years in the states its been harder and harder to get a legit script for any kinda narcotic pain reliever.  I even had my own script for 120 Norco a month for about 2 years then I was cut off because my doctor was all worried and scared about DEA, me getting addicted to them, etc.  Now I am on methadone thanks to that situation.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> dude i've dealt with several people that read the big number on the pill (500, 325,etc) and use that as the amount of good stuff in the pill.  I am not positive if these people were trying to get over on me but I would lean towards them just being dumbass stoners who never sold pills and therefore know really nothing about them. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have been down both of those paths.  I never really thought of it though.  I can tell you though that i enjoy opiates way much more than alcohol any day.  I used to not be able to go 1 day without booze and likewise for opiates.  I just got sick of drinking so I gave it up cold turkey and luckily felt a lot better with out any kind of withdrawls.  I drank everyday for about 4 years straight.  Now with opiates I was doing some form of them for about 5 years straight too.  I was scripted norcos for a long time but thanks to doctor's getting scared now about scripting anything I got cut off. I now am on methadone.  To answer your question is a bit hard actually now that i think of it.  I don't think I could give you a solid answer other than repeating that opiates are always #1 to me over any other substance.

	<TEXT> depends. that is actually what made me move to bth is because of the sparse pill scene and the cost of pills.  I'm sure places like SF where I used to live its easy to score either pills or H.  When I lived near SF I didn't really do opiates so I never bothered.  Now that i live kind of middle of nowhere so not many pills and i have to drive almost an hour for bth. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> i smoked some bth once since being on mmt and it wasn't as much of a rush or high as usual but it was there for sure- the high but it was weaker than normal.  also could be a bit of placebo effect know that methadone is supposed to block other opiates.  I am on 50mg currently only on mmt for 3 weeks.  I slipped up because it's just the ritual of smoking bth that I love.  I have norcos at my house and I haven't touched them since starting mmt. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> i have been on opiates legally prescribed to me for about 5 years.  I recently moved so i have a new pain doc who was giving me norcos.  in the recent last few months my using was getting a bit out of control- buying on the street, even smoking a bit of tar and I thought to myself i should do something about this.  I have done suboxone in the past but they just didn't work for me.  I researched methadone for a couple weeks then I went down and started on the program.  I made an appoinment with my pain doc about a week in and told him what I was doing (in my state the law states that if you are in a clinic you do not have to tell your doctor.  But i went ahead an was honest to him and he was actually really proud of me and encouraging.  I was pretty nervous and the appoinment went by so fast that I forgot to even ask him if he would prescribe me it.  Probably not now that he know's I was in a clinic but I am trying to really be "clean"  now instead of spending all my money on pills or H since my script was not making it even close to the end of the month.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've been on done for about 2 weeks now.  It's a clinic deal and I have to drive there 7 days a week to get my stuff and I live about 30 mins away.  I was wondering if it would be possible to get a doctor to script me done instead of doing what I have to do everyday.  It's a bit expensive on gas with the drive everyday.  I did some research and I think that it is possible to get it from a doctor instead of going to a clinic everday and dosing.  Just wanting any feedback if anyone has tried to get scripted thru a doc.  I have a history of chronic pain that is documented and have a current pain mgmt doctor.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I just started it last week but i'm doing it to get "clean" so I am in a program and go everyday to get my dose.  I am on a fairly low dose (50mg)  and i have yet to really feel a high from it. more just like it keeps most of my withdrawls and cravings at bay so I can get on with my life and not worry about how i'm gonna hustle up $100 a day for H.  If you were to have no tolerance to opiates I could see it as being ok but never understood why people would ever do it recreationally. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> same exact thing happened to me basically last fall.  we are living in an era now that we will be seeing a huge decline in prescribing pain meds and it's going to fuck shit up worse because people who would never had before will now be trying heroin.  my doctor just gave me the go to answers: DEA cracking down, Obama Care and the fact that a small amount of dumbasses had to go and OD and fuck it up for the rest of us responsible people.  As for advice, fuck it just go to the street and find some H, that is what I did when I got cut off my pills. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> OK this was on wiki:   Under the chemical names diamorphine and diacetylmorphine, heroin is a legally prescribed controlled drug in the United Kingdom, and is supplied in tablet or injectable form for the same indications as morphine is, often being preferred over morphine due to its lower side-effect profile.[citation needed] It is also available for prescription to long-term users as a form of opioid replacement therapy in the Netherlands, United Kingdom, Switzerland, Germany, and Denmark, alongside psycho-social carein the same manner that methadone or Suboxone (buprenorphine) are used in the United States and Canada[10][11]and a similar programme is being campaigned for by liberal political parties in Norway. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This has been discussed some I think before but does anyone know exactly what is legal and where?   For instance I have heard that codeine for the most part be it cough syrup or T3's I hear is legal in Canada.  I have also talked to people that tell me pharmacutical opiates such as norco and oxy and more or less legal in Mexico at most pharmacies.  I have even heard as far as some counties in the US will sell products with codeine OTC!?!?  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Pills to H </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I've been doing pills for about 5 years now.  Everything from 5's to OP 80s.  I'm getting sick of paying out the ass for pills. $200 for like 8 blues is not my piece of cake.  I know where I can get tar heroin.  I assume that the H would go a lot farther than buying pills financially speaking?  I also would plan on smoking it and I assume you would foil it?  I have never done H before and want to know how much to try at first.  I would think like a pin head size?   Getting on subs and getting clean is my long term goal but before I am done with opiates I would like to just try this once.  Please don't criticize me, I just want some honest advice here!!! thanks guys. and oh my tolerance is decent.  lets say 120mg oxy daily but could handle more without completely nodding. </TEXT>
