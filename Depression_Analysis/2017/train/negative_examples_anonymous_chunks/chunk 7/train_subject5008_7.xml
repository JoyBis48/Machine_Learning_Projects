	<TEXT> But it you stop people from with mental illness from flying no one with mental illness who flies will come forward. Same thing applies to guns "crazy people can't own guns" so if you have mental illness and own guns, you won't seek help. On the other hand, should mentally ill people be able to own guns or fly? People just need to accept that there is not such thing as 100% security and there is a 0.00001% chance they will die at the hands of some random nutjob. On the other hand, the'll probably die cause of all the fucking junk food they eat, or the drugs they do, or the people they have sex with, or that one little asshole epithelial cell that had a bad day. Everyone of the people reading this thread will die one day. A significant portion will die well before they expect to. Most of them will die painfully. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> But what if they don't find out they were wrong, isn't life in prison for an innocent person a pretty high cost? If you believe in a justice system you accept that a tiny percentage of innocent people will suffer. Why is this OK if you merely jail them for life, but not OK if you kill them. Besides if you're on death row you have expanded rights to appeal that those with life do not have so if there IS an incorrect verdict there is a greater chance of it coming to light. Thats why most death row inmates in California oppose ending the death penalty in that state. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> all depends on who is on the plane, 300 people four hours from the target...fuck yea. A late night commuter flight on a tuesday with 10 people on board 5 minutes from the target....good luck. Keep in mind that it may be very possible to barricade the door. Counting on the passengers to take back the plane is highly speculative. Just following the 2 in the cockpit rule seems a lot easier. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If the USA went "all in, no rules" against ISIS, even with just conventional weapons it would be over in under a week. The problem would be that hundreds of thousands of Iraqis would be killed. In 1991 the USA went up against 650,000 iraqis much better armed than ISIS and killed 30,000 of them while losing under 200 of their own. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I find it strange that we are supposed to accept models of all body weights (something you can control and is related to your health) because it might give people an unrealistic impression of beauty. However, there is no movement to accept models who are not attractive in other ways (poor bone structure, asymmetry), features which we cannot control. Do models that fit these conventional measures of attractiveness not also create an unrealistic standard of beauty? Where is the movement for models with ugly faces? There also doesn't seem to be much of a movement for male models who are "plus size." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Pro-gun? He is also a founding member of the Massachusetts Against Trafficking Handguns Coalition who issued the following statement: "With gun violence at a 10-year high in Boston and increasing in Springfield, New Bedford and other Massachusetts cities, we applaud leaders like Deval Patrick for advocating smart policies to deal with this growing crisis. Deval Patrick has shown himself to be a true champion for peace and public safety by recognizing the need to crack down on the flow of illegal guns coming into the Commonwealth. We thank Mr. Patrick for vowing to make our communities safer places to live, work and raise families and congratulate him on his victory in Tuesday's Democratic Party Primary."

Sounds like he was just an opportunist hustler.

	<TEXT> Actually this isn't really true anymore. While obviously you shouldn't use a tourniquet for minor wounds, experience in Iraq and Afghanistan has shown that the risk of limb loss has been vastly overstated. Using a tourniquet is reasonable for any bleeding that can't be controlled with direct pressure or repositioning. Every soldier in on patrol in Afghanistan carries a minimum of 4 tourniquets, one for each limb.

edit from your link: In rare situations tourniquet application will be necessary and lifesaving in the civilian prehospital setting. Tourniquets are no longer only considered as a last resort device. Practitioners should familiarise themselves with this simple piece of equipment and be prepared to use it in appropriate cases without an irrational fear of complications

tl;dr- if you can't stop the bleeding with direct pressure or repositioning use a tourniquet because the benefits almost certainly outweigh the risks. </TEXT>
