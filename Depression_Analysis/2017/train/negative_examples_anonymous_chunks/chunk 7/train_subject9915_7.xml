On the other hand, I believe laws that are in place to defend religious practices should be enforced for public Satanists (who may be outed against their will). </TEXT>

And no, most of this new generation doesn't know or care much about this stuff. It's not like this is a secret to anyone, we cover it on our website and Blanche Barton is currently working on a revised edition of "The Church of Satan" which will obviously include this. When I last spoke to her she mentioned it was funny how most people she spoke to are uninterested in that whole drama, but much more interested in LaVey's personal history and the early days of the Magic Circle, and what other members are doing now. Hence her focus on completing the revised edition of "Secret Life of a Satanist", plans for the relaunch of the Cloven Hoof, and promotion of real-world events and activities (such as the William Mortensen book signing in LA this weekend, which featured an open discussion with Barton and Moynihan on LaVey and his techniques on applying the Command to Look, with COS members in attendance).  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Aquino left for various reasons, and yes one of them was because he felt LaVey betrayed the literal Devil by selling memberships. LaVey laughed this off as he never claimed to believe in a literal devil and often spoke highly of materialism, capitalism, and using magic (lesser and greater) to achieve wealth. Aquino was apparently able to live with this as long as he was given power within the CoS to ordain initiatory degrees based on occultnik mumbo jumbo. LaVey rejected this, as he didn't care for wasting time on stuff that had no physical, material payoff (wealth, power, pleasure). Coincidentally Aquino received a message from Satan, appearing as Set and yadda yadda yadda...   

Right after this LaVey got fed up with any theists or occultniks in his organization, who he politely tolerated prior to this. Central sent off letters disbanding the grotto system and telling anyone who believed in the need for initiatory occultism to hit the road. So many did, and he was happy to see them GTFO. So what I'm getting at is that the big "schism" as others call it was much more about power politics and LaVeys disdain for armchair occultniks than commercialism. </TEXT>

Commercialized means designed principally for financial gain. So then, no, the Church of Satan is not a commercialized organization. Does it shy away from making money? No, but rather than be hypocrites about it we accept the rational need for compensation for time and resources.   

Ask any MBA, the Church of Satan has a lousy "business model" if it's intended to be a profit orientated venture. We do not have reoccurring fees, we spend thousands of man hours handling communications, press, legal cases, and appearances. We advertise and support books that we do not profit off, in fact they profit some of our naysayers. We advertise the projects of our members, of which the organization gets zero income.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The whole idea of Black vs. White Magic comes from the basic occult notion that any magic that is selfish or prideful is "black magic". LaVey throws out that whole concept altogether within Satanism, as he points out that all magic is selfish.   

"White magic is supposedly utilized only for good or unselfish purposes, and black magic, we are told, is used only for selfish or "evil" reasons. Satanism draws no such dividing line. Magic is magic, be it used to help or hinder. The Satanist, being the magician, should have the ability to decide what is just, and then apply the powers of magic to attain his goals." </TEXT>

We *may* pray to Satan in a ritual, but this a symbolic, metaphoric act, where we build up and project our egos and refer to this externalized ego as Satan.

	<TEXT> LaVey was a materialist (or more like naturalist if you want to get into metaphysical ontology). He did not believe in conscious, communicable gods, demons, spirits, beings or in any existence beyond this one carnal life. While he was open to possibilities of "supernatural" events he maintained that these phenomenon are part of the material, natural world that not yet explained by science. He vehemently and repeatedly rejected spirituality and mysticism. All that said, he recognized man's need for mythology, archetypes, ritual, and pageantry, so he formalized an organized religion that best represents man's true nature, and called it Satanism. While some "spiritual" Satanists may say they are influenced by LaVey, they really don't have much common ground beyond aesthetics and symbols. The commonality breaks down as soon as you consider metaphysics and logical arguments.   

Obviously the term "satanism" existed prior to LaVey, which he recognized and appreciated, but considered it dysfunctional and inaccurate due to the fact that it was almost always used from a Judeo-Christian perspective, heretical/Gnostic at best, but always chained to Christian cosmology.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hard to say. If it's Satanis then I don't think it's worth a whole lot. The CoS didn't really attach stickers to materials, so I'm leaning on it being a duplicate, which there were many.

	<TEXT> What you may have is a copy of Satanis, which is a Satanic Mass, not a Black Mass. [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXIkJ0NraoY).   
There never really was a "Church" of Satan. In the 60's and early 70's LaVey hosted some parties and rituals at his home, often referred to as The Black House, but he never considered it an actual "church". Some attendees called it a church, for lack of a better word, but LaVey didn't really endorse that. After the early 70's LaVey pretty much closed the doors to his home except for close friends and select members of the CoS. He also stopped doing public rituals.  

You say "black mass" like it's a regular thing the CoS does, but it's not. LaVey only performed a few of Black Masses, and some were not even really anti-Christian. The purpose of the Black Mass is to mock a particular target. Christianity wasn't particularly interesting to LaVey, he preferred to attack psychiatry, drug culture, extreme liberalism, hippies, etc.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Though I hesitate on saying "whatever you want", I would agree with with /u/devilmachineyea in that each Satanist would need to decided how they feel. Some might feel bad, if they had similar situations in their lives, or some might not care. If you're looking for a blanket uniform answer you're not going to get one.  

I will say that in my experience Satanists can be empathetic, and tend to be sensitive to the human animal experience. This is different from wanting to actually interfere or otherwise try to inject ourselves into other people's business. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The reason LaVey included the Enochian Keys was because, at the time, they were considered sinister and he was warned against it by the occult "community". This implied that they Keys still generated emotional response and caused fear among certain people, so he included them. Nowadays this isn't the case as much, so you may not want to use them. I forget where but LaVey once said if you're having trouble with Enochian just skip it and recite your favorite poem. I've seen Satanic rituals where they use Gaelic, old Indo-European languages, and even Arabic instead of Enochian to fit the needs of that particular working. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> First of all, if you're talking about Satanism, it's magic, not magick. Magic with a k was popularized by Crowley (who's not a Satanist) as a way of distinguishing between stage magic and illusions (what LaVey calls Lesser Magic) from ritualized ceremonial magic(k). LaVey's observation is that they are all one and the same, and ceremonial magic often uses techniques of Lesser Magic to achieve results. He was also NOT a mystical person, so the idea that magic(k) was something more "holy" or "sacred" was an anathema to him. All magic, lesser or greater, was working within the material world and carnal. Which leads me to the next point.   

LaVey certainly believed in having influences over events outside his direct control. He tells stories, and many people who have visited him have odd coincidences before and after. Even the stone cold unbelieving Rolling Stone writer felt like LaVey was able to shift the atmosphere around him. The thing is, LaVey never likened any of this to "spirituality" or "mysticism". All that implies some greater power or greater plane of existence. LaVey rejects this. He believes there are parts of this world, this natural, materialistic world, that we yet do not understand. Since it is not understood, it's "dark", and therefore, being a poetic, dramatic type, he symbolizes these unknowns as dark forces of nature.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hate to be pedantic but with Satanism you don't spell "magic" with a k under any circumstances. The whole idea of "magic with a k" came from Crowley (not a Satanist) who wanted to distinguish between illusionist/sleight of hand (lesser) magic from ceremonial/greater magic. So even in the appropriate case "lesser magick" doesn't make sense.  

Anyway... Great tips, regardless! </TEXT>

I hear this time and time again, that "things changed" or the CoS "went inactive", as if there was once a time when the COS was marching down the street and patting people on the back. It was never "active" in the sense that these detractors seem to want to believe it was or should have been. That was never the idea, never the application, and we continue in that tradition. I'd answer any questions or rebuttals anyone has on this topic. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Here are all the fundamental texts on Satanism: [Church of Satan: Printed Works](http://churchofsatan.com/sources-print.php). These are the core books. This is required reading you're serious about understanding LaVey's philosophy, as well as High Priest Peter H. Gilmore's direction. Anything else is supplementary.  

Here's a recommended reading list directly from Anton LaVey. ["This is the list as originally published in Magistra Blanche Bartons The Church of Satan as approved by Magus Anton Szandor LaVey."](http://churchofsatan.com/sources-book-list.php). Here are some of my choice picks:  
Carl Jung: Man and His Symbols   
Herbert Spencer: The Study of Sociology  
Michael Foucault: Madness and Civilization  
H. L. Mencken: The American Language  
Fyodor Dostoevsky: Notes from Underground  
Robert W. Chambers: The King in Yellow  
Jack London: The Sea Wolf  
John Milton: Paradise Lost  

One of the most overlooked books by LaVey is "The Compleat Witch" (aka "The Satanic Witch"). I see a lot of people make assumptions about LaVey's theories on Lesser   Greater Magic without having had read this book, which is *all about that*. LaVey included an extensive bibliography that gives you an crystal clear look at his base materialism and secularism. Here's is an illustrated and annotated collection of the bibliography, maintained by members of the Church of Satan's Priesthood of Mendes: [Compleat Witch Illustrated Bibliography Project](http://compleatwitch.blogspot.com/).  

This should give enough reading for quite a long time. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I get your enthusiasm but Satanism is an individualist philosophy, so such a social club might not be the best idea. Though all Satanists share a bedrock philosophy, their applications and independent interests may vary greatly, sometimes leading to conflicts. It's a mistake to think that just because someone else is a Satanist means that you'd get along swimmingly. 

Satanism is also anti-proselytizing, meaning you should not try to convince other people that Satanism is right for them. Most people will not (and cannot) accept Satanism, and that's alright. Do not expect people to respect you just because you're a Satanist, instead have them respect you because you're a great writer, mathematician, computer programmer, athlete, musician, artist, photographer, cartoonist, etc.  

That said, I wish you luck. Peter H. Gilmore is a close friend of mine and I know he got started with Satanism in high school, where he met High Priestess Peggy Nadramia. He graduated as Valedictorian of his class and his speech had a Satanic spirit.

	<TEXT> Like /u/lightning_falls states, prayer is a plea for Divine Intervention with some conscious, communicable being. Satanism rejects all notions of the Divine and of any communicable beings, so that's one major difference.  

The other is something that's a common misconception with LaVey's system of Greater Magic. He clearly states that Greater Magic should be a tool to help tip the scales to your favor, not to perform miracles. Whether this phenomenon is a placebo based on psychodramatic shifts or some biochemical expansion of the mind is a area of skeptical inquiry amongst Satanists who are interested in this. LaVey himself didn't care what it was, his approach was pragmatic and all that mattered is what worked. </TEXT>

If you want to refer to other writers, other philosophies or theologies, other occultists and their practices, fine. I won't agree with you, but I won't argue you. But if anyone tries to frame it as something sourced from LaVey, then be prepared to debate it factually.

	<TEXT> There are numerous religions that do not believe in outside forces, that do not address an afterlife. Where do you come to this conclusion? LaVey created Satanism as a new kind of religion that wholeheartedly accepts man as a purely carnal animal but with a need for metaphor, symbols, and rituals. The philosophy within Satanism is important, and crucial, but so are the traditions, the metaphors, the rituals, the culture. It's all part of the Satanic religion that is still in the early years. LaVey picked up the scent, and knew this was coming, that religion would be redefined in the future as secular phenomenon. He points to television, the internet, the entertainment industry as the new religions for the masses. He built Satanism as the alternative religion not just to the spiritual   mystical religions of the past, but of the consumerist religions of the future.

	<TEXT> I disagree with that assessment of LaVey's "religious" stance. In fact it was in his later writings and interviews that LaVey pushed harder on Satanism being a religion over philosophy exactly because of the push back he got from occultists and pagans who questioned his lack of theism. You can see him refer to Satanism as a religion in Satan Speaks and The Devil's Notebook, both written in the 90's. One of his last articles is titled **["THE WORLDS MOST POWERFUL RELIGION"](http://churchofsatan.com/worlds-most-powerful-religion.php)**, in which he specifically makes the case for Satanism as a codified, organized, and post-modern 21st century religion by critiquing and dissecting what makes something a religion or religious. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Each person can apply Satanism how they want, but LaVey did actively push Satanism as a **religion** over just a philosophy. There is philosophy within Satanism, but there's also Satanic culture, dogma, ritual, iconography, etymology, art, tradition, and literature that's all just as important as the philosophy itself. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Personally, I call them a heretical Christian, Muslim, Jew, or whatever theological cosmology they adhere to. In regards to someone who believes in the Christian Devil/Satan, then in turn they must give Christ significance in order to remain theologically consistent. If not, then they are inconsistent in their theology and therefore just a kook. Once you claim to subscribe to some metaphysical theology then you're bound to its history, unless you want to debate thousands of years of theology "just because it sounds cool".  </TEXT>
