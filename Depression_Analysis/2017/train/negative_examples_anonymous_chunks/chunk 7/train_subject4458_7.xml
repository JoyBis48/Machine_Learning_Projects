	<TEXT> Haha I guess that's what I'm trying to get at, what in the game is considered a projectile and what's not.  Also it says in the description for RBAY "Reflects **most** enemy projectiles during tornado" so I figured there were some exceptions.  I'll add the clarifications on my original post </TEXT>

Reflects **most** enemy projectiles during tornado </TEXT>
