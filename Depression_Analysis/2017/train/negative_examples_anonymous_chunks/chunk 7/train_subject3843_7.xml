	<TEXT> I think I'm old enough where I can say "sorry guys, I had no idea what I was getting into."  But some of the younger kids might just be to brazen or daft to realize they are way out of their league.

It would be nice if there was a place for lesser skilled players who are serious and want to improve.  But I guess that would just get ruined anyhow. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I went on cevo once,  I'm a silver and I hold my own in regular pugs.  I get sick of being queued with the one guy who's afk, one guy who's playing music, and one guy who is yelling in Russian.  I don't really care if I win or lose, but I like a good game.  Although winning is better.


I joined a cevo round because I figured maybe there would be more teamwork, people making calls, people who understand eco vs buy round, etc.  Long story short,  I got put in my place.  No one really treated me poorly, and I apologized for my 5 and 20.


I think lesser skilled players, especially ones with no friends that play cs like myself feel stuck pugging with brand new players, Russians, and general assholes.  Some people just want the full experience of what cs has to offer, experience the comradery team players and pros experience.


Sorry if we ruin your day. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's just remaining holiday balance that will be payed off next month.  90% of the time I don't have any balance.  The APR isn't a huge deal to me, just wondering how its all calculated.  I figure I'm getting a new card for X features, but having a lower apr would be a nice bonus for the few "oh crap, next month" moments.

	<TEXT> I got a form from Discover today, and was thinking about getting an it card anyhow (at the moment I only have my cap plat with no rewards and a high apr)
after a 14 month intro APR of 0% my APR will be 10.99% to 22.99% based on my creditworthiness.  Would that be determined based on my discover account, or numerous things including my discover account?  Is there any calculations I could do to estimate what my apr would actually be?  I have a mortgage with only about a 25k balance, roughly $200 balance on my cap card, and my credit score is ~725
Im just sick of my cap apr being about 24% and them refusing to drop it, despite being a customer for about 2 years, and never missing a payment. 10.99% sounds real good about now.
thanks if you can shine any light, or if you have any other cards I should consider getting other than the it card. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There's a lot of scam artists on twitch that will make large donations, then contact their bank and cancel the payment.  It also takes the bank quite a while to notify the recipient that they are liable for the money+ fees.  So if they took the money out of PayPal and spent it it leaves them between a rock and a hard place.  I've heard it's actually quite common, which is why a lot of streamers won't accept donations or at least not abnormally large donations.

It's pretty sad and messed up especially leaving the streamer to take the blame.

	<TEXT> Your home wifi doesn't have a cap unless you set it.  Ie. Transferring data from one computer to another computer on your network wouldn't effect the data set by your isp. 

 If you are streaming on your phone from your wireless provider. The only way to send that to the chromecast would be to set up you're phone as a wireless access point and connect the chromecast to it that way.  The data used wouldn't be much different whether watching content on your phone or on the chromecast.  The easier way to do things would be to use wifi on your phone and you'd only be using data from your home data cap. Sending the data to your chromecast that way wouldn't effect your isp set data Cap at all, but if you have a really low cap then I'm not sure it's your best option.  

What is your home data Cap of you don't mind me asking,  it's really strange to see a lower cap on your home internet than on your cell.  Although I guess it depends on what country you live in. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT>   I don't have an interview yet, but I'm thinking about applying to a few places around town.  Really I'm only looking for a few part-time hours a week,  I have a full time job.  

  I'd like to make a good impression, in general.  Especially if they really like me and happen to offer me something better than what I have going on right now.  In the past I have worked retail jobs, but never at a small boutique with a very clear demographic.  I feel a suit would be too much, plus I work in manufacturing at the moment.  Any suits I own were last minute funeral suits.  On the opposite side I'd feel really weird showing up about a job in denim regardless of how much I may spend on denim.  

  As a rule of thumb do you normally dress in clothes one step more formal than what the store generally sells, or how the current employees are dressed? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree with your idea, personally I could care less about resolution/fps (to an extent)  I would rather have a fun game.  I enjoy subjective reviews, having the ability to "get to know" the reviewer while consuming their media.

But 900p is worse than 1080P technically, 30 fps is worse than 60 fps technically.  There is nothing subjective about it.  

objectivegamereviews.com does a pretty good job at ironically objective game reviews.  </TEXT>
