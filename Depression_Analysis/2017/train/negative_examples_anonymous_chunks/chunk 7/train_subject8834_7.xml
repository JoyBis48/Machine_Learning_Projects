	<TEXT> Another IT guy. 27 years old. On my own. I like to think of my self as pretty sociable, but instead of driving back to my hometown to go out this the weekend (which I normally do) I decided to get drunk and play Rockband tonight. That usually turns into playing more and more depressing music as the night wears on and waking up with a hangover tomorrow morning.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was in the passenger seat of a truck that crashed into a tree going about 60 MPH. I did not have a seat belt on. Face smashed off the windshield, but I survived relatively unharmed with no lasting effects (aside from back pain).
