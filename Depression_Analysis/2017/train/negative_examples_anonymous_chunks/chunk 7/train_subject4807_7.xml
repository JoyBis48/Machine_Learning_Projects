	<TEXT> Be careful: a social media call to fool around with your employer's  FB rating by embellishing the story could backfire. You've given more than enough info here for someone -- the jerks or your boss or IHOP corporate -- to identify your real name, and you can't assume none of those people reads reddit. You also can't assume that IHOP would condone that behavior, which (since you're one of their managers) could look like IHOP is doing it, possibly in violation of FB's TOS.

Much better to get in front of this by telling the story from your point of view, in writing, to your immediate supervisor or district manager. If you can get a copy of the police incident report,great -- if this takes time, tell them you've asked for it already. That alone will help protect you from blowback you don't deserve. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  more and more jobs are being taken up because of increases in automation

The problem isn't advertising or automation. The problem is concentration of ownership into the hands of a few megacorps that have zero commitment to journalistic values and demand an unrealistically high ROI -- thus, the decimation of editorial staffers, starting with the ones whose work took a long time and cost a lot of money.

ProPublica is great -- but you do understand, I hope, that its existence came about because there were so many old-school journos without jobs. It was almost the only success out of hundreds of efforts to build something new. What happened is basically that the megacorps outsourced serious reporting to foundations, leaving reporters without *ongoing* and (relatively) secure institutional support. The new organizations employ a tiny fraction of the available talent and publish an equally tiny fraction of the serious news that used to get published. 

You can't see the difference because you can't see the work that is no longer even getting started anymore, but I've been in the business for longer than most redditors have been alive and the scale of what's no longer investigated -- especially at the local/state level -- is horrifying.

Anyway, the idiot mods here have decided that this post is off-topic because it isn't "explicitly about current US politics", so if you want to comment further, you'll need to go to one of the other postings. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I didn't say "what they think is the right thing". I said, and meant, the [objectively] right thing -- the action that is sustainable within the ecology of human society.

The point is that most people, psychopaths and sociopaths excepted, are both hard-wired and conditioned to want to be fair and compassionate. When some fail to do this, it's a lack of resources -- material or knowledge -- that causes the problem. The idea that it's only natural to compete is so reductionist as to be completely misleading. When public policy is based on that assumption we get massive wealth inequality and wars to protect the system that made some people so much richer than others. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I know the VT ACLU has been keeping watch on police misconduct in Burlington, if you're still there.

Remember, different cities have different histories. What we're all really looking for is an overview of best practices, and of best strategies for getting there. My city had a long history of lefty lawyers suing the City for $$$$ over individual incidents, plus a lot of agitation from white radicals who are anti-cop, without much changing. Then 20 years ago it got so bad the Justice Department almost took over the police department, before reaching an agreement with the City that had the effect of forcing a big jump ahead on things like training. We're still struggling, but at a different starting level than other cities, even those in the same state.

But I have another question: why is this discussion in this reddit? I love Bernie, but I'm unaware of his laser-focused economic populism campaign taking on an agenda for building an all-sided progressive movement. He almost certainly agrees on the importance of this issue, but the task at hand is a campaign for office.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks for this post, which is about 100% more informative than anything the Dispatch itself has published, and way more important than most of the posts here lately about any subject. Love or hate the Dispatch, it still has huge influence on the overall public understanding of what constitutes news in Columbus.

The graf below, describing what happened at the ProJo, succinctly describes the central issue with concentration of newspaper ownership into the hands of a few corporations that care more about the bottom line than the public good:

...many reporters let go were veterans with deep institutional and community knowledge. They were replaced by younger, less-expensive writers, something that "gnaws at a lot of us in the newsroom...

"Gnaws at us" likely means they can't stop thinking about the coverage they can't do any longer for lack of staff and funding: enterprise and investigative and science reporting, for starters.

The guy they say will take over, Jason Taylor from Gannett, has most recently been running the Chattanooga Times Free Press and the Jackson (MS) Clarion-Ledger. Neither paper has suffered big staff cuts AFAIK, but I'm reserving judgment until I hear back from friends who work at those papers. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My thoughts, exactly. This is *not* uplifting news.

Anybody who thinks you're too negative or over-reacting needs to know that this year, 2015, has been called the "crunch year" by climate scientists -- the last chance to even slow down the destruction of our home planet. In light of that, a "business decision" to slowly taper off production and use up the bad ingredient can be seen for what it is: the immoral acceptance of the amoral dictates of capitalism.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What does this even mean? 

The way corporate owners control coverage is by *not* covering things that should be reported -- and there's no way for most reporters to effectively counter that. So they cover what they can, as ethically as they can, and so manage to at least feed their kids. The news industry has changed so much in the last 20 years that you could staff a hundred good news orgs with the reporters who have been fired for objecting to the new regime.

Be glad that there are still people trying to do it right.

This. Reddit is not "a free speech initiative". It's a business. It's nowhere near dying. A lot of 15 year olds are bent out of shape because ... they're 15 years old. 

It's entirely possible to spend an entire day (or night) on reddit right now without even knowing about this "scandal". I know about it because I subscribe to /r/announcements, but the other 50 or so subreddits I visit haven't even noticed the "uproar".

If you're bothering to read /r/all, stop. It's a piss-poor substitute for the combination of good subscriptions plus use of the "random" button. And SRD is a cesspool to be avoided at all costs. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Hedges and others are smart enough to recognize that if there isn't a peaceful revolution there will be violent chaos.

But not apparently smart enough to take the lesson that a "revolutionary moment" is when the people's resistance has the capacity to manage the earthquake of global economic disaster, not just when old systems and structures are failing. That term has a specific meaning, and this isn't it. 

To only point  to the objective conditions without assessing the subjective factor -- organized strategic resistance -- is to raise false hopes of a shortcut that doesn't require the tedium of base-building. If those false hopes lead self-declared revolutionaries to assume there's a mass movement at their backs when there isn't one, the result will be worse than ugly.    </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah ... no. There's a reason why the leaders of the New Left summed up the main error of 60s and 70s as having believed *that* was "a revolutionary moment". Until there is a unified movement capable of both strategic planning and logistical resilience, the only thing going on here is temptation to take shortcuts.

There is a real danger in this moment from the agitators on the left and the right who wrongly think that it's enough to "bring chaos", after which everything will sort itself out. Such a scenario would default to the right, but probably not the way some of them assume. Preventing that is probably the most urgent task; leading a revolution is rather more than the left can do, especially in the US.

	<TEXT> Thank you! I haven't watched the whole thing yet, but right away you can see the type of seats my friend and I got -- right at field level, behind a low railing -- and even see another girl get the same treatment my friend got. I can't wait to see if we're in this film!

Adding, I can already see it includes ["the fifth Beatle", radio DJ Murray the K](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_the_K#.22The_Fifth_Beatle.22), whose "Swingin' Soiree" show on WINS in New York was the soundtrack we listened to every night on [first-generation transistor radios](http://www.mcrfb.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/1963-Teen-Girl-Listening-to-Transistor-Radio.jpg) when our parents thought we were studying or sleeping. Murray the K was referred to by some parents (not mine) as "Moral Decay", and blamed for fanning the flames of Beatlemania. The idea that the Beatles' music was just that good was lost on a lot of older folks then. 

Fortunately, my parents knew enough about music to appreciate both the roots and the innovation that made the band sound so new. My mother even bought herself a four-inch diameter button to wear that said "I love Ringo!", and although they didn't attend, they bought me and my brother tickets and drove us to Shea. It was an unforgettable gift.

I also see that there were five other acts, which I assume we heard but ignored.

BTW, the classmate I went with climbed over the railing in front of us to try to storm the stage (we had GREAT seats), but was grabbed and pushed back onto her seat by stadium security. I don't think she even paused in her screaming. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> *Columbus Guardian* was a better paper, for the short time it existed. It had serious reporters, serious attitude and Irv Oslin, FFS. 

Even *Alive!* was a better paper than *TOP* until *Alive!* stopped covering local news in 1988. Hell, even *Hoot!* was a better paper than TOP, whose business model boiled down to pissing people off to guarantee newsstand pick-up greater than the skin ads alone brought in.

And the FreePress has been squatting space that should be taken by something better grounded ever since it went cuckoo for chemtrails. The Black Box voting obsession didn't help their credibility -- or that of saner organizations that affiliate with them for lack of any other general purpose progressive outlet.

Anyway, I don't see *The Dispatch* coverage changing much. The news hole is so small already that it *can't* change much, and they don't need to feed readers' inevitable resentment against the interlopers even one minute sooner than absolutely necessary. I'm guessing the new owners will tweak the peripheral businesses before they change the flagship publication, drawing out the advantage of reflexive reader loyalty to the familiar format while they study the market up close.

	<TEXT> Civility is *everything* in an anonymous online forum. This is where we get to make up our own rules, which are based on what we want to get out of the experience. 

Reddit allows for thousands of places where users can be brutal to each other if they want. But this is the subreddit that represents Columbus to the world, and it *can* be the kind of ideal neighborhood almost nobody ever gets to live in IRL: respectful of others' choices, supportive of others' needs, irreverent enough to laugh at ourselves, passionate about the future of our common homeplace.

Civility until unjustly attacked is a pretty good standard.

	<TEXT>  That's not a personal attack. She's a pretty shitty poster. Everything she posts is either uninteresting, self-promotional or has been posted a dozen times before.

Are you listening to yourself? Of course that's a personal attack. If one user's posts are so annoying that you're willing to go round up 18 citations to her posts -- four of those from other subreddits, and three of *those* from another state -- it's well beyond a discussion of why people in this subreddit, in general, seem to downvote everything, from anybody.

If you want to critique a certain style of using reddit, fine. I'd probably agree with you about this style -- not because there are a lot of similar pleas for help that could/should be found independently through simple searches, but because there aren't any posts contributing important local information or art or opportunities. It's a very selfish way to approach a public forum, let alone a community. I thinks it is a style deserves criticism, because if it becomes the norm it undercuts the usefulness, never mind the enjoyability, of the forum.

*[donewaiting.com, I'm looking at you.]*

Anyway: did you notice that I did not actually name the annoying poster in the comments above? That's giving the offender room to gracefully absorb the criticism and decide to change, without making their entire existence the issue and the target for the everybody who wanders by.

I wrote long here for the same reason you went out and researched those posts: both of us want a better /r/Columbus. We might not agree on what that means, but could we please agree to try to minimize targeting individuals this way?   </TEXT>

Adding, the use of the term "shitpost" is a remarkably reliable indicator of a user who regards reddit as a competition among individuals rather than a forum for discussion, never mind community-building.

	<TEXT> If you remember that with such vivid (and appropriate) bitterness, you probably also remember the brief, golden moment when Columbus readers benefited from the competition between *three* weekly alternative papers -- Alive! and Columbus Guardian being the others.

And as for bad moments in journalism: the out-of-state owners of Columbus Guardian *pulped the archives* on their way out of town, which is why many here may not remember that award-winning paper. That move was especially galling because it came on the heels of learning that those publishers, who had lured experienced reporters here from much bigger papers on the promise that they'd be on the cutting edge of the move to digital, had never bothered to digitize the archives. All that lofty talk about reclaiming serious journalism, and it turned out they were all about the widgets. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The point is that *other people* will help put up the money that you don't have, once you've called a meeting or attended one that someone else has called. What's happening in your state's Bernie subreddit? In mine, a guy I never heard of before (and I've been a political activist here for a looooong time) has already set up meetings in three cities, just by online networking. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  the answer is of course no.

The answer is "not yet". Somebody needs to take responsibility in every town and city to start a local campaign, and that involves ordering, prepaying for, and distributing/re-selling these at cost. Why wait to start that? If this campaign isn't about grassroots organizing, it's nothing. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Flat rate shipping is $15. Your problem here is not that you're too poor to buy from the official store, but that you're not ordering enough stuff. Can you find others in your area to put together a larger order? Maybe some local group would like to start distributing these, and you all could put together the front money for a whole pack of these items. Sooner or later *somebody* will do this in your area -- why not you, now? </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  nor does it fix the impression this person might now have of the sub or city in general.

Except in this case it did. 

And in my experience, that's pretty normal -- while willingness to make a meaningful apology is still very rare. For instance, you've now called me an "asshole" and such several times *without explaining what you mean*, and you show no inkling that this might be something that merits apology. If you can articulate what you mean, and apologize for name calling, we might have something to talk about. But even then, I'd have no idea who I'm talking to because you've erased your user history by changing names. For all anybody knows, you're one of the trolls who've been treating me unfairly for years here. Nobody has any basis to judge whether you're somebody whose criticisms are worth the time to read.

So unless you're ready to apologize for being overharsh and unspecific, we're done here. </TEXT>
