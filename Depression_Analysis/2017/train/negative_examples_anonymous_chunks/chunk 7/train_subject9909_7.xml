	<TEXT> Every river in America was a bounty of aquatic life until agriculture slited up the rivers. At Mount Vernon they wrote one could almost walk across the Potomac to Maryland on the backs of fish. Colonial agriculture was so bad Washington and Jefferson tried to innovate ways to free the nation from cash crops, but the economics didn't pan out and people continued cutting down forest and plowing the topsoil into erosive gushes. Before the civil war, even, there where 40 foot deep gullies in the middle of farmland in the Carolinas and northern Georgia. You could drive a carriage through them. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> One more reason for smaller government, I suppose. :P

Complaining about the cost of government doesn't make sense whether the resistor even cares about large government or not. If people want smaller government, the cost to make a new center is a convenience cost which also improves representation. Two small centers have more overhead costs but are easier to keep everything else small through activism and involvement. If people don't care about size and spending, then wtf. They probably want to keep the people who want to leave tied up under their elective power to get benefits. Shame!

Not saying you are complaining. Thank you for introducing me to that. It is very interesting.

I've never heard any of that before and haven't ever thought about splitting counties, before. Legislative and councilmatic districts, yes. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Big Idea. How to revitalize a watershed. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-06-16 23:58:17 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> What if someone bought all the land of a watershed above a tributary stream in an American desert or other currently non-arable land?

Mildly re-shape the land to hold the water and plant the native species back (not a statement against non-native species). Check dams, swales, stream calming, berms, planting mounds... maybe even groundwater-recharge wells like in India.

First of all, I can think of few better ways to improve the value of land making this a very exciting investment.

Second, the people downstream will be affected positively and negatively (although the argument might be made that not taking the optimal flow for a watershed into account is not something you could sue for).

Third, would the government have something to say about that? </TEXT>

Make sure you get the real stuff, in the paint aisle of a hardware store. This will make sure the soap releases from the cloth once it has attached to the grease and smoke particles. Better than getting grease on all the walls in your apartment. The hood fan won't collect everything. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Reducing "Social Distance" </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> [Read an article](http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/06/thank-you-chinese/395660/?single_page=true) on /r/travel, today.

 And then another will announce Gei wo yan!, literally Give me salt!, with no sign of a please or thank you involved... A Chinese linguist, Kaidi Zhan, says that using a please, as in Please pass the salt, actually has the opposite effect of politeness here in China. The Chinese way of being polite to each other with words is to shorten the social distance between you. And saying please serves to insert a kind of buffer or space that says, in effect, that we need some formality between us here.

Reading and seeing scenes like this has always reinforced the idea of closeness. A family huddled around a small fire sharing a sparse meal; a pack of soldiers or workers performing a task with few commands; some friends gesturing to pass the drink along.

Does Social Distance have another name?

What is the most poignant example you can recall? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> [Very good.](http://www.ontheissues.org/2016/Rand_Paul_Immigration.htm)

Here's the plan. Secure the border. Make congress enact a detailed plan instead of just ordering a department to do so with little forcing them to. Once the border is secure, find a way for those who are not citizens yet to become legal - but not citizens directly. Eviction is not an option and citizenship is not fair. Bringing them into the legal workforce satisfies all parties... because in that process we can root out the criminals.

The process will not be immediate, and will hopefully coincide with economic growth that will make sure they do not get blamed for taking the jobs from American citizens.

I don't know why some Catholics want open borders; it certainly isn't for the economic reasons that Rand Paul understands the benefits. There can be no open borders right now between us and the dire situations in South America. </TEXT>

People lease farmland all the time - even the government does this in some places. The people who take th elease obviously intend to make money.

The NPS has a resource - arable land. It is going to let a farmer borrow the land for a fee. The farmer will pay the fee in hopes of making profit off the land. </TEXT>

There would be absolute frustration with the rules when you can't do something logical, manage the sheer numbers of troops, or deal with Jedi secret missions.

It is a space opera, not a military history novel. The mechanics of the universe sound good, look good, but are hard to work with in practice.

It would be cool, however, to see the force sensitivity of your generals and agents in the character screen. </TEXT>
