	<TITLE> Loaner dilemma </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-02-17 00:06:39 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I have been borrowing an Audi for a while now from my local dealer. They're replacing my engine under Fidelitys warranty which means they're taking their sweet old time (about to be 5 months now)

I didnt care too much because a new engine is better plus I get to a drive around a nice loaner.

Anyway my current dilemma is that I bent one of the rims and have a flat in one of the tires. I can probably get away with plugging the flat tire so I dont have to buy them a new tire. But I wonder what I can do besides just telling the dealer that hey I bent your rim.
I'm assuming if i tell the dealer they're either going to make me pay for the rim + tire + labor or contact my insurance (which Im assuming means a rate hike on my insurance). So whats the better option? Or do you think they won't care and just replace it on their own (wishful thinking i guess)? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I feel your pain!  They gave me a freakin galant at one of the dealers I went to. Needless to say that i never went there again!

My current and usual dealer usually hooks it up with a nice loaner like Q5, A6's. Best one yet would have to be A6 Supercharged. That car was something else. But never an S-series. I had no idea they loaned them out else I would've asked. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So there is a verse in the bible [1 Corinthians 7:9] which talks about not to burn with passion and if someone cant control themselves then they should get married.

I dont think these guys are at the stage where they cant really control themselves but I'm sure that the temptations are going to get stronger in the long term if proper boundaries are not set. 

Thats why courting with intentions of marriage might be a good idea. Im not saying they should solely get married for sex but if they do love each other and are compatible then i dont see why not again assuming they are somewhat mature enough to make that step.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You dont but if they're still living in their parents home and are fairly young then getting "parental guidance" would be a wise idea. 

Also im not suggesting marriage so he can start having kids. Im suggesting that if they are in love and with parental "guidance" they should get married if theyre at the right age rather than burn in passion and guilt.

	<TEXT> I didnt see an age. 
I'm not suggesting that they get married because they had oral sex. Im suggesting that these temptations are only going to escalate. So first create boundaries that will allow you to have some control over it.
But if they're near an age where they can be married than why not. Of course under the approval of their parents since they might not be old enough to make a wise decision in this matter. If they're 17 then def no and my comment on seeking parents approval would have cleared that out of the way. However if theyre in their early 20s then maybe they can. (Im basing this off on avg marriage age of 27-28) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm going to have to side with you haven't lost your virginity yet. 
Oral sex is not penetration. So you're still a virgin!

That said you obviously feel guilt so ask for forgiveness. And I would agree with an earlier post that starting right way create boundaries! Aka no alone time, etc. 

That said, how old are you guys, would marriage be an option? Because sexual sin is going to get louder. And if you two really love each other than it might be wise to get married with your parents consent. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So I'm looking at the S P and for that matter most stocks and everything is relatively going up.

We had two major crashes in recent years near the dot-com and the real-estate boom. Both were relatively priced at 1300-1500 S P. Currently the S P is at 2062. 

Do you think we're due another crash?

I'll admit that I don't know jack about investing but as a skeptic the idea that the markets are continue to go up, up and up seems far-fetched.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> **This post is going to come off as very arrogant. But I promise you that its meant in a good gesture.**

So i grew up in US for the past 20 years and before that I was born and lived for the 7 best years of my life in India. That said, few months back I went to India to "find a wife". I really didn't want to go but I went anyway for the sake of my parents. 

Anyway, I pretty much grew up as a beta male. Was always taught to be the nice guy and suck it up. Partly because our culture, religion, and upbringing has formed me to be this way. And honestly I enjoy being this way.

However when I went to India I realized that alot of girls are alpha females. They're disrespectful, arrogant and self-centered, etc. But at the same time they were confident, self-assured, smart, etc. Now don't get me wrong not all girls were like that but many were.
 
I guess my question to you guys is :
* How should the current generation of guys with our upbringing get used to this? (because in all honesty our culture hasn't prepped us for this)
* What happened to Indian girls? (was it the competition, pressure, etc)
