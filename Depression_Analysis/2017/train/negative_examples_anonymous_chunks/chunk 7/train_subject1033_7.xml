	<TEXT>  To call it a terrorist flag is a bit of a stretch.

Not really. The KKK has always been quite fond of it, and remains so along with most other "White Power" groups.

	<TEXT> They were sent to die to protect the interests of the permanent leisure class of their day: the Plantation Owners.

Most of them were poor sharecroppers living on the Plantation Owners' land, and didn't have a choice. They were conscripted to preserve the economic interests of their Masters, who owned these poor whites nearly as completely as they did their African-descended slaves.

The "Southern Pride" meme that has taken root has helped these poor white sharecroppers and their descendants psychologically deal with their exploitation by their own white Masters who used them as cannon fodder to protect their cotton profits.

These poor whites have been angry at precisely the wrong people for over 150 years. </TEXT>

I believe that middle/lower-caste Libertarians are so goddamned starry-eyed over their greed-driven, bankrupt ideology that they they can't see how they'll be crushed under the wheels of the 0.001% leisure class they live to fellate.

And so we come to the central delusion of Libertarianism: most all Libertarians are so fucking gullible they believe they'll *be* among that 0.001% that calls the shots.

As satisfying as it would be to see all of these "Liberty-Lovers" working on chain gangs at the whim of their newly-installed Masters of Capital, prudence and a love of this nation prevents me from wishing they get a chance to find out how truly, deeply, and disastrously wrong they are.

Any American with a sense of honor or decency resigned from the NRA a long time ago. If you're still allowing yourself to be a victim of LaPierre and his fellow scamsters, though, it's never too late to repent and resign. Do it today. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> *A reading from the Newsletters of St. Ron Paul*

Blast 'em?

"If you live in a major city, youve probably already heard about the newest threat to your life and limb, and your family: carjacking.

"It is the hip-hop thing to do among the urban youth who play unsuspecting whites like pianos. The youth simply walk up to a car they like, pull a gun, tell the family to get out, steal their jewelry and wallets, and take the car to wreck. Such actions have ballooned in the recent months.

"In the old days, average people could avoid such youth by staying out of bad neighborhoods. Empowered by media, police, and political complicity, however, the youth now roam everywhere looking for cars to steal and people to rob.

"What can you do? More and more Americans are carrying a gun in the car. An ex-cop I know advises that if you have to use a gun on a youth, you should leave the scene immediately, disposing of the wiped off gun as soon as possible. Such a gun cannot, of course, be registered to you, but one bought privately (through the classifieds, for example).

"I frankly dont know what to make of such advice, but even in my little town of Lake Jackson, Texas, Ive urged everyone in my family to know how to use a gun in self defense. **For the animals are coming.**"

	<TEXT> White Nationalists have long fantasized about a "coming Race War."

There's a RWNJ decades-old race-war novel out there ("The Turner Diaries") that many extremists of the American Right view as a blueprint  (Timothy McVeigh among them.)

Ron Paul's racist 1990s newsletters addressed the  "Race War" topic often.

I fear right-wing domestic terrorists and their sympathizers are growing restless again. Given their self-gratifying "Hero Patriot" fantasies in which they "restore America," we should all be aware of the dangers they may pose. We've seen it boil over before, as in Oklahoma City.
