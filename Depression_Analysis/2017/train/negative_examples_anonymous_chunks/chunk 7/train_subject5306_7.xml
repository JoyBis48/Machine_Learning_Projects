	<TEXT> I mean, it *does* look like a controlled demolition though. It's obviously not. But it looks like one. It just so happens that a controlled demolition and a collapse from an impact and burning fuel look very very similar because, duh Joe, that's what buildings look like when they fall down.

I think Joe is just used to saying whatever the hell he wants on his show with no repercussions, since it's a very casual non-formal podcast where anyone can talk about anything they want like friends hanging out.

Dunning on the other hand, is from a podcast where he is claiming to be scientifically accurate and constructive and influencing people's ideas and behaviour.

They're two completely different guys with completely different goals with completely different beliefs about what their responsibilities as a host of a podcast show are, and so their styles just clash horrendously and they can never really find any common ground.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's especially annoying because during the full podcast every single point Dunning wanted to argue about, and all the negative things he said about Joe's show, were all based on him taking everything Joe said completely literally and then picking it apart to prove him wrong and make him seem like a dangerous liar. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I listened to this podcast when it first came out, and man, I love both these guy's shows, so this was pretty painful to listen to. 

I really hate how Dunning said "you're taking my words too literally" whereas absolutely  every single complaint Dunning had against Joe's podcast was based on taking all his words totally literally and then trying to pick them apart to prove Rogan to be wrong.

Dunning clearly wasn't expecting Rogan to fight back as much as he was, probably because whenever he debunks things on his Skeptoid podcast it's just him by himself talking to no one. But then Rogan also clearly doesn't give a shit about logical fallacies and scientific arguments and cares more about just chatting casually person to person, and the two styles do not mix at all. 

Dunning seemed to just keep trying to pick apart everything and anything he could to try to seem smarter, and Rogan was just so non-specific and all over the place. It made Dunning seem like a total petty douche bag, and made Rogan seem like he doesn't get a lot of points Dunning is making, or doesn't really care to.

I still enjoy both their podcasts, and they both seem like really nice dudes, but this podcast just went on and on and on in increasingly argumentative and petty circles that it was too infuriating to listen to.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> None of my non-Godzilla fan friends really liked it. They all thought it was 'okay' dumb fun but kinda boring. I liked it the most out of everyone. 

The Godzilla stuff all felt perfect, it just wasn't quite enough. The marketing made it seem like such a huge epic apocalyptic blockbuster, but the movie felt kinda 'small' 

Plus no one really seemed very surprised or horrified at learning of the existence of giant monsters. </TEXT>

EDIT: just saw it. It was good. Not great. The entire second act just felt worthless, and for a movie with so little monster action, it didn't at all make use of the human characters. But when it got good, it was an incredible experience. Really well shot, all the bits with Godzilla were great, the first act felt really strong and like it was building to something great. But then it was just okay. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Absolutely perfect choice. 

One of my favourite composers around, everything he does is so fun and lively and interesting and full of energy. The only complaint I ever hear about him is that he's clearly very derivative of John Williams' style, and that's definitely an intentional thing.

So who better than to score the fresh new reboot of a classic film than the fresh new reboot of that film's composer </TEXT>

	<TEXT> TLDR; 9/10

"Few recent films have had as much pre-release hype as Gareth Edwards Godzilla, as legions of devoted fans have hungrily devoured each new detail, tease, and marketing release. So, does it deliver? In a word: Yes.

Legendary Pictures' Godzilla origin story carries the weight of unwieldy expectations, but rather than buckle, it is ultimately a fantastic - though imperfect - example of the genre. Gareth Edwards both depicts what is beloved about this magnificent creature and creates a film that is distinctly its own entity, one that brings Godzilla to gorgeous new life. The Easter Eggs and nods to previous versions and additional suitmation favorites will likely be appreciated by sharp-eyed aficionados. If Edwards installment serves as your introduction to the King of the Monsters, though, theres plenty for you to enjoy as well."

	<TEXT> I disagree but it is pretty dang fantastic .

The final fight in a The Raid 2 is incredible. It's so intricately and amazingly well choreographed, and is certainly an unmatched show of skill and technique. But the final fight in the first Raid just felt way more brutal and exciting, all three men were completely destroyed and battling to survive and you could feel the desperation and brutality, coupled with the emotional aspect of Rama trying to save his brother. 
Plus the Assassin wasn't nearly as well built up as an unstoppable killing machine as Mad Dog.

I never once felt that Rama was in any way close to losing the fights in the second movie. And while they were much more varied and better choreographed on a technical skill level, the first film had an insane sense of urgency and brutality and it constantly felt like Rama was only just barely surviving each encounter. Plus The Raid 2 had tonnes of fights that didn't even involve the main characters so the outcome didn't even really matter. 

Fucking amazing film though.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Jurassic Park movies have always had very very normal every day looking characters. They were always believable and real and were perfect for the 'ordinary person in an extraordinary situation' theme that Spielberg has always been great at.
I mean don't get me wrong, Neill and Goldblum and Dern are all good looking people, but they were realistically good looking, and were just ordinary realistically-aged unexceptional scientists who were out of their element.

This whole cast looks super young and fit and Hollywood-attractive, and people have even been saying Pratt is playing an ex-marine dinosaur wrangler.

Doesn't exactly seem like the same realistic relatable ordinary regular cast of characters we're used to from this franchise.

But hey, I'm sure it's no big deal and I'm still super excited for this movie in a big big way. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Is there anyway to get a good list of what Godzilla movies are available on what region DVDs/Blurays and what features they have? </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I got really excited when I saw that Toho was releasing every single Godzilla movie on Blu-ray this year, only to find out that none of them will apparently have English subtitles. 

I've been trying to collect Godzilla DVDs for quite some time now, but it's so hard tracking them all down and figuring out which ones were released in which region. I have a couple that have dubs and subtitles, some with just subtitles, some with both the American and Japanese versions on one disc, and other films I simply can't find on DVD at all. And of course there's a handful of Godzilla movies on Blu-ray already but no where near a full collection.

I was super excited to just get all these new Blu-rays, but without subtitles they're pretty much useless to me, so I just don't know what to do about building the perfect collection.

Any help or advice from any other Godzilla collectors would be greatly appreciated. Anyone know if these new Toho Bluray releases might find themselves getting an international version with subtitles or am I just going to have to be happy with my hodge podge of mismatched Blurays and DVDs forever </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would go for the original 1954 Godzilla, then the 1984 Godzilla, and then maybe Godzilla 2000. 
There are 3 distinct 'eras' of Godzilla, "Showa" starting with the 1954 original, "Hesei" starting with the 1984 Godzilla, and 'Millenium" starting with Godzilla 2000. Each era the timeline is 'rebooted' and starts fresh to be accessible for new viewers.

Godzilla vs Biollante, Godzilla vs Mothra (1992) Giant Monsters All Out Attack (my personal favorite) Tokyo S.O.S, and Godzilla vs Desotroyah are pretty highly regarded and very accessible and would probably be the best to watch before you start really getting deep into the weirdness that is the Godzilla franchise

Obviously this is leaving out a lot of the classics, (like Godzilla vs King Kong, Destroy All Monsters, Smog Monster, etc.) but I think starting on the older campier crazier Showa movies might be kinda jarring to modern viewers unfamiliar with Godzilla since they are pretty weird and cheap and out there, and aren't always easy to watch, and might need to be eased into after some more 'normal' Godzilla films.

You shouldn't really need to worry about any exact order or anything since most of the films are fairly stand alone so you can pretty much jump around as you wish. 

James Rolfe (AVGN) has a fantastic little series that briefly sums up each Godzilla film and explains the different eras and styles [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Avc4AS3AvcA list=PLAAD30B9523D89FAA), and I highly reccommend watching this first and then choosing your own order based on what appeals to you. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> First off, boo I am so jealous. Secondly, some spoiler free questions. 

How was it tonally? Was it as dark and apocalyptic as the trailers or was it a bit more summer blockbuster?

The trailers seem to be showing off a lot of Bryan Cranston and Ken Watanabe, how was Aaron Taylor Johnson as the lead?

Do we get the atomic breath?

Do we get decent story and character stuff outside of a typical big monster/disaster blockbuster movie?

We've heard a lot about not seeing a whole bunch of Godzilla until the final showdown in San Francisco. Mostly just glimpses and short sequences and a whole lot of build up. Is this accurate? If so, how does the first half handle not having much monster action? 

And most importantly, once we get to the big San Francisco sequence, how long is it and how much action do we get? Do we get some big extended city destruction like a lot of big action films have had recently?

It's so hard to avoid ruining this movie for myself. I'm trying not to read too much or even watch those new clips but the hype is so strong. Only 2 more weeks... </TEXT>

I assume due to his own experience, he once said something about children shouldn't be used as actors as it's ultimately unhealthy for the kid and can damage their childhood experience or something. So I'd be interested on heating him talk about the production of this film.    </TEXT>

Phil Tippet said Jurassic World would not have very much animatronics at all and would be a very CGI heavy film. </TEXT>

I'm assuming it's slightly trimmed down for WonderCon though since it seemed a little rushed.

But holy cats everything about that was so awesome and scary and atmospheric and well directed and just everything you could want in a badass Godzilla movie! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The CGI in Pacific Rim was handled by ILM, the CGI in Godzilla is by Weta. I tend to think ILM usually crafts the most incredible and realistic CGI in the film industry, but ever since King Kong Weta is definitely a close second. 

ILM is responsible for Jurassic Park, Pirates of the Carribbean and Transformers, Weta does the LOTR films, Avatar and the new Planet of the Apes movies </TEXT>

It's a great idea, and I certainly don't want skinny dinosaur legs or anything, but it's a little too elephant like and seems like it might be veering more towards cartoony over realistic. Everything else about the design is perfect. </TEXT>

Huh. First people were saying he was playing an ex-marine, now this. I don't know if either of those things have been confirmed officially, but an ex-marine dino wrangler seems kinda ridiculous and cheesy and cliche, even for a Jurassic Park movie. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah watching this edit actually made me look up the show to see how terrible it was, and I ended up watching both full seasons. I actually enjoyed it a fair bit.

It's stupid and cheesy and can be horribly lame and cringy sometimes, but somehow less offensive than most reality shows around. A lot of the personalities were actually pretty fun to watch. There are always a few narcissistic delusional assholes on shows like this, but despite being quite awkward a lot of the time, some of them really seem like genuinely good people. 

Episodes are way too long and over-dramatized, but I was surprised at how much I got into it. And I usually really hate geexploitation shit like this. </TEXT>
