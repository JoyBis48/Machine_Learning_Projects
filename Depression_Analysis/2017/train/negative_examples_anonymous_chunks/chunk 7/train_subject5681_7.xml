	<TEXT> Well Lisa was last week. Mark is currently with Karen as she has a broader reach in voter approval (speculation). Lisa was last seen sharing a pie with Connor, so it would appear he's still trying to salvage this campaign. Does Connor know something, or have any blackmail material on Mark, as he has been quiet throughout this whole poster incident, whereas Rawlins is flapping on about anything and everything. I think this whole poster incident has opened a Pandora's Box and I'm not sure this school is ready for such a deep scandal. </TEXT>
