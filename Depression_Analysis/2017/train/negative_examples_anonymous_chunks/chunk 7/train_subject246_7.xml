	<TEXT> TO Police have been running a file on rooftoppers for a while, complete with aliases, pictures etc.  I suspect this was part of a larger thing in which police advised security companies to arrest anyone they caught in order to assist their investigation.

I was busted at Trump in Toronto in the summer and it was not a pleasant experience - luckily I got off with a trespass fine and thats all.  Same cant be said for one of the others who was carrying a bolt cutter - I had no idea.

I may be entirely wrong about my assessment, either way it's probably not their first arrest! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It seems that I have stirred up quite the healthy and passionate debate on the definition of "Abandoned" and the legalities of photographing abandoned places.

Yesterday, I allowed a story to be published in the Daily Mail about a home my friend and I explored in 2013 (we did not discover this house), a remarkable home that is a true time capsule. For whatever reason, whoever owns this house has "abandoned" it - meaning no one is caring for it, no one has stopped in to check on things, and whoever the last person out the door was - well they forgot to lock the door too. 

It was eventually and inevitably discovered by those who seek to photograph decay and abandonment and it has been the topic of much discussion, debate and turmoil. It turns out that the home was willed to the church of the woman who lived there, and not to her daughter, causing some kind of legal battle. That would mean this home is in fact, not abandoned. Or does it? 

Does any of this give anyone the right to enter it and photograph it....? No. However, had a handful of explorers not done such a thing, the treasures found in this house would have likely fallen into an even further state of decay.

The owner of a well known website contacted the elderly daughter and (much to the chagrin of many), the house has now been sealed and the valuable contents have been saved and boxed up. Had it not been for this group of "trespassers" this home and its contents would have been lost to time.

Everyone has an opinion, and they are entitled to that - I stand behind my decision to a) enter and photograph this house b) tell the fascinating story and show the world what can happen when your families treasures are not properly cared for once someone has passed on.

Thank you all for fueling such great debate on this subject

	<TEXT> Hey All

Lets get things right

1 - I did not discover the house: this guy did https://www.facebook.com/LeftAheadPhotography 

2 - I asked the DM to remove any reference to me "discovering" the house 

3 - I also told them the house was abandoned in the 80's - not the 60's but they didn't make then change

It's been fun watching all of the reactions to this story, I love the many opinions and debates for and against it!!

I posted this last night on my facebook page
