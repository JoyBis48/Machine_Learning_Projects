	<TEXT> it was at a local radiological imaging facility instead of a hospital. the doctor referred me there because he said it would be much cheaper. i asked at the front desk when i signed in and they told me one amount. after i filled out all the paperwork, they gave me the updated amount at a different counter.  </TEXT>
