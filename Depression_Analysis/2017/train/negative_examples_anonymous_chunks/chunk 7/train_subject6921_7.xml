	<TEXT> Honestly I think you can get new Core M4s for in the neighborhood of $600. Another prolly $100 in the shitty bushnell scope. All the other stuff has been traded around one way or another so I couldn't really say </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Core M-4 with a bushmaster varminter 20" fluted barrel I traded my m4 profile for, recycled A2 handguard and stainless railed gas block from an AR-10, green A2 stock and rifle buffer I traded a CTR for and a hogue grip a buddy wasn't using anymore. Cheapest ammo I can find. My folks were generous and got me the Monarch 3 binos for xmas. Gotta love college.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I loved the JP brake I had on my model 700 .308. I can't speak for the person sitting next to me, but let me just say with the large frame model from JP it felt like shooting .223. Expensive, but buy with confidence, they make an excellent product. </TEXT>
