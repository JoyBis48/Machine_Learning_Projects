	<TEXT> How did you convert the tail?  and did that battery give you good operating time?  I have been thinking about going with something larger.  Another person mentioned the brushed motor might be inefficient do you think it would be worth getting a brushless to convert it? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks for the suggestions,  I think if i make the ailerons big enough and with enough throw they should make a difference.  As for the motor i have thought abought replacing it, but the problem is i have no idea what to replace it with.  This is my first project, and I don't really know how to decide which motor to buy. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Converting Old 2channel Fighterbird. </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I have an old 2 channel fighterbird from a long time ago.  

http://www.hobbyzonerc.com/Products/Default.aspx?ProdID=HBZ4000

I am trying to convert it from a 2 channel to a 4 channel.  I think the only things that i am really going to save are the motor and the fuselage.  The electronics are just too old.  My question is what kind of esc should i use with the motor it has.  I am pretty sure it is a brushed motor.  It looks almost exactly like [this one](http://secure.hobbyzone.com/search/hcag1055.html?gclid=Cj0KEQjwqe-rBRCv_J6qs6isp6EBEiQAmbctFvBjGdlD69sZoG2TEcgYfqfWj6G93EO6dwa5Rk4JyqcaApkF8P8HAQ).

The problem is i can not find any statistics on this motor.  I would like to figure out what the amps and voltage requriements are so i can buy an appropriate ESC and battery.  

Can anyone help me out?

I feel like this could be a fun project, I just need some help figuring this out so that i can move on to the other parts of the airplane. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So I remember hearing a while back about a possible deal to get the imagery updated for OSM.  I was wondering when can we expect it to be updated?  in some places it is getting as much as 4-5 years old which is a big problem because It makes mapping new features exceedingly hard.  

I am just wondering how long is the time between imagery updates typically? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yea someone mentioned that it might have been slightly purposeful.  They compared the bending in LOK to boxing, which makes sense with it being a similar time period to the 1920s.  It's still boring though. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree although frame by frame the quality was higher, I feel like they were much less imaginative blocking out the scenes and with their camera angles.  I also really missed the choreography of the ALTA fights.  I feel like LOK often involves the characters just using their bending to throw things at each other.  A great comparison is the [Toph, Aang, and Azula fight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdcdhgn0zHM) vs the [Kuvira and Korra Fight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqYY17r1UjQ).  For me the the Korra Fight is just plain boring visually compared to the ALTA.  They are standing in pretty much in the same place and just hurling things at each other.  

This is just one example there are plenty of others in Korra where they are just throwing things and ALTA ones where there is excellent choreography and it it is really fun to watch. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Basically if the pages were to prove this, it would show that the Bush administration basically cherry picked the data they wanted so that they could get public support behind attacking the countries that they wanted to.  Politically Saudi Arabia has been a relatively good ally in the region.  

The motive would be they did not want to attack a country that was an "ally" and also pretty well armed.  They preferred to focus on countries that were not friendly to the US and would be relatively easy to invade.  Like Iraq and Afghanistan.  Notice they did not invade Iran, because that country would have been able to defend it self much better, even though Iran was much more of a threat by the "Axis of Evil" standards than Iraq was. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It tries to prevent people from rating out agriculture companies when the people leak about bad practices going on.  

There are many ways to go about doing it, in some states they have made it illegal to lie about your intentions when getting a job.  I believe this particular one makes it possible to sue the employee for damages which is just ridiculous.  It would be like If the car companies had quality control issues and started passing laws saying they could sue an employee for lost sales if they go to the media about the quality control issues.  The only difference is this is our food which makes it even more scary. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Wow over the last day we have almost doubled the amount of subscribers to /r/New_Horizons. I want to say welcome to everyone new, I know everyone is looking forward to seeing awesome pictures of Pluto in July.

As a quick memo to everyone, updates from New Horizons have been a bit slow lately We expect them to pick up more as New Horizons gets closer to Pluto.  We will post updates, photos, ect as soon as we find them, but sometimes we can go a few days with out any new material.  If you see something interesting don't be afraid to post it. Anyway to the main point of this thread.

This is our second comment thread.  If you have questions, comments, theories, ect post it here. Hopefully we can answer anything you are wondering about.

	<TEXT> I used to do map maker.  I stopped a few years ago when i started to realize more and more that I was basically giving this billion dollar corporation free labor.  

I found out about OSM when I was looking for maps for my GPS and came across http://garmin.openstreetmap.nl/ great site and I made a profile and started contributing to OSM after that. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> All those things are exactly what Google Map Maker had in place.  It's not impossible to solve but it would be difficult.  I feel like wikipedia has shown that it can be done though and I feel like OSM should use similar techniques to Wikipedia to solve the problem of vandalism if it starts to become a problem.  

I also feel like one thing that has protected OSM for a while is actually how the learning curve is steep.  Especially for JOSM.  Having multiple editing tools makes it a lot easier to stop vandalism in my opinion.  The ID editor is the easiest to use and would probably attract the most trolls.  If you needed to you could put more restrictions on the easier editors or something like that. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think i enjoyed the later seasons more because Korra matured and stopped acting like a jerk.  I don't like watching shows with characters who are disrespectful and act like jerks most of all when they do it to the people who are most important to them.  There is a difference between being strong willed, and being disrespectful, and Korra was disrespectful up until she went back to Tenszin in season 2.  I remember one episode that stuck out for me from ATLA was first episode of Book 3 when Aang made a point to be nice to Katara's dad even though Katara was obviously unhappy with her dad.  That made him so much more mature in my eyes than if he had just sat there. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yea but this is under a very controlled circumstance.  Aborts don't happen when everything is going right.  also the reason it didn't start tumbling was because of the trunk.  In general you want something to be passively controlled in circumstances where you might not be able to be confident in your data or your systems.  People forget that lifting the trunk is not that big of a deal.  The Soyuz lifts a fairing and the habitation module as well as the decent module during its aborts. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It tends to fall into 3 major categories.  Almost all of the time it involves removing the clitoris and then depending on the type they may remove other parts.  The less extreme forms would be comparable to cutting off the end of the penis. the most extreme forms would be comparable to removing the whole penis.  Either way circumcision does not affect the mans quality of life in any way close to the way FGM affects a woman.

	<TEXT> Circumcision is less controversial though, is generally not detrimental to the mans well being/sexual health and arguably has health benefits like reducing the transmission of HIV/AIDS as well as some other STDs.  FGM is more like cutting off the whole or part of the penis.

Edit: I didn't realize stating facts would be so unpopular.  here is a link talking about how HIV transmission is reduced with circumcised heterosexual males.  http://www.who.int/hiv/topics/malecircumcision/en/

Edit2: Everyone calm down, I am not saying I support circumcision.

Edit3: Defined well being.

Edit4: /u/blank_sunday_stares posted a good link showing no correlation between circumcision and STDs http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19115756 I thought I should put it in my post.  I did say that it was arguable wether it reduces HIV/AIDS transmission.  As always more science could help. </TEXT>

Personally I don't think I would listen to music while I am flying.  I feel like it would be a distraction and possibly make me miss radio calls from ATC if I have flight following or something.  But I want to see what other people think.  Do you listen to music while you are flying?
