	<TEXT> Traffic isn't that bad. I work in Mission Valley but live just east of there and traffic isn't bad. I used to live in Little Italy and East Village and the traffic wasn't bad at all heading to work. It's nothing at all like LA or New York. 

Groceries aren't that bad and there are a LOT of small markets (shop in the Vietnamese or Mexican markets for cheap produce).

Don't forget that your utilities will drop. We don't need heat for most of the year (I think I've had it on once this winter) and you don't really need AC.  </TEXT>
