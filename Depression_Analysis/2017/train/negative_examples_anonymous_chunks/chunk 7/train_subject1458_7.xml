Neither of these places is about coffee, however. I still need to try Fennarios. Perhaps that will be my next stop. 

As for what becomes of the old court annex, a park would be great. I'd also like to see it become another store - perhaps offering antiques or men's clothing.  </TEXT>

The Ukraine should split - mostly along the course of the Dnepr - with the Eastern bank staying in the Russian sphere and the Western bank (minus, maybe, Odessa) pursuing a course for European integration.

Principally, the case is filled with Soviet Union materials from the VMF. However, I put a few Red Army pins and Lenin pins in there because it's my only shadow box and I really liked them. Additionally, I've got an East German Red Banner of Labor 2nd Class in there that was much too gorgeous to leave in a dark drawer.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Lyrics from the comments section:

Chorus:

Wide is my Motherland,

Of her many forests, fields, and rivers!

I know of no other such country

Where a man can breathe so freely.



From Moscow to the borders,

From the southern mountains to the northern sea

A man stands as a master

Over his vast Motherland.



Throughout life, and freely and widely,

Just like the Volga flows.

The youth are always dear to us,

The old are always honoured by us.



Chorus



Our fields are too wide for the eyes,

Our cities are too many to remember,

Our proud word - comrade -

To us is higher than all fine words.



With this word everywhere we feel at home.

For us there are no blacks or coloureds.

This word is familiar to everyone,

With it we always find friends.



Chorus



Over the country, the spring breeze is blowing.

Every day life becomes more joyful,

And no one on earth could know

Our great ways of laughter and love.



But our brows shall frown sternly

If an enemy attempts to break us.

As a bride, we love our Motherland,

We protect her, as a gentle mother.


Chorus

The United States and its allies wage war not for victory or the elimination of threats but for the enforcement of global hegemony, the protection of business interests, and the collection of resources. Peace will not arrive because we intentionally drop just enough bombs to enforce our will while still leaving enough room to produce more bombs and keep the military-industrial complex chugging along. </TEXT>

As a disabled person who was born with a congenital birth defect, I strongly encourage everybody reading this to consider the great gains our society and our species will make by shaping its own genetic destiny.

The only hazard is that we must ensure that this technology is widespread. Concentrating it in corporate or government hands will inevitably warp our species into something that is morally unwholesome. Allowing everybody access to these tools will force a level of oversight and fairness that will drive us into a new age of biological prosperity.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yep. They also used that song during the scene where the dictator is dancing with the globe. However, they cut it out mid way through during that scene as the globe bursts in his hands, just before the music swells to its climax. It is only allowed to finish during the Jewish peasant's speech at the end, providing a subtle thematic contrast that I missed the first few times I watched the movie. 

Given the Nazis' fondness for Richard Wagner, I found everything about the way they used Lohengrin in the film to be absolutely perfect. When evil men co-opt beautiful things, the artistic community has a duty to take such things back from them. This, I think, was done exceptionally in that film. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hans Zimmer is okay, but no composer can match the emotional resonance of Wagner.

Everything about that scene is utterly perfect. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was thinking that Sidious would be the Lord of Manipulation, seeing as how he's the king of all puppet masters. 

In a way, a special and twisted way, one could imagine that Vader has assumed the mantle of Darth Traya. There must *always* be a Darth Traya, one that holds the knowledge of betrayal. Who has been betrayed in their heart, and will betray in turn.

Darth Krayt: Lord of Fury

Then again, Fink being the ruthless, plagiarizing capitalist that he is, he probably just didn't care to copy anything but the essentials. There's the possibility that he couldn't get it working with Columbia's slightly less advanced laboratories and much more rigidly religious approach to the sciences, however.
