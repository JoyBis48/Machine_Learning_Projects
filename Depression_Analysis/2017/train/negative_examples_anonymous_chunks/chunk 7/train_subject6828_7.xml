	<TEXT> (Just my opinion.)


I like the idea. The execution faltered a bit. If you wanna take comedy serious, from what I can tell, you have to be consistent. Always be funny and everyone treats the situation seriously. The main character did well to keep a straight face but the secondary didn't. (Just my opinion.)


I wasn't laughing. The whole time I was waiting for the other shoe to drop but it never did. By the end I was like, oh he's just a dick. That's the joke? (Just my opinion.)

I would've had some comic relief to bring balance to his brashness. Like a fat mentor who can't keep up with perps and tells the intern not to run faster. (Just my opinion.)



I'm not trying to discourage you at all. I would never do that. You frame your shots well and you clearly have a drive to entertain and that's wonderful. Also keep in mind that comedy is the hardest challenge to tackle because it's so subjective. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What you could do is engineer a memory for yourself. Take a very slow walk around your block, don't create any distractions for yourself and absorb as much as possible. Go back home and write down what you remember, focus on what stuck out to you and ask yourself why that specifically. 

Now remember, films only access sight and sound. It is up to you as a filmmaker to recreate the emotions of memories using only those two senses. Be creative, I challenge you to experiment and come up with something no one else has. 

P.S. don't try to crowbar in other senses with dialogue such as "oh this is delicious" or "it smells wonderful in this park."

P.P.S. Smell-o-vision was a thing, did not catch on. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Writing question: For shorts 1-5 minutes in length do you guys tend to make scripts for it? I was wondering how much pre-production goes into these. 


Also, is there a recommended time for writing? 

For example: 1st draft (1-4 months) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Just saw it. The plot could have been a little tighter, the "dad" person James would go into didn't lead anywhere, whereas the "homeless" and "business" persons were not only congruent but also simultaneous. That and the punching sound effect at the beginning.was a bit jarring and took me out for a second. 


Aside from that I was entertained throughout, and I was eager to see how it would end. Fortunately, you guys didn't make the common mistake other filmmakers make where the concept is drawn out and makes you lose interest. In this case, you took a good amount of time to set up your characters and tell your story. Kudos. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 1) All I ever read about are festivals, where can I look up markets in my area? Which of the two are better for networking?


2) I've never made a film before, how should I go about funding my first flick?


3) What's a one sheet?


4) For each level of funding, what type of film qualifies? For example, a tiny 20 minute film about jogging. Would that qualify for pre sales?

5) I know I'll sound like a 1800's era gentleman but on the funding side, who do I see about these things?
