	<TEXT> The guy was probably the worst president of all time. A sociopath to his core. Google what Billy Sol Estes said about him. Read the book "a Texan looks at Lyndon". read about the box 13 scandal. He never should've even been a senator. Google hitman Malcolm Wallace and his connection to LBJ. check out his connections to Brown and Root who funded his campaigns and profiteered from the Vietnam War. check out the video interview on youtube with his mistress Madeleine Brown, she implicates him in the death of JFK, as do many others. 

The guy was a walking criminal all through his life, driven like an animal to dominate people.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Listen to Alan Watts lectures on Taoism on YouTube. Read his short book "Tao: The Watecourse Way". I would recommend *not* reading "The Tao of Pooh". Not a good book to start with. And I didn't think it was a good book anyway. 

Essentially Taoism is the world behind words, the nature of reality, the way of harmony. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Words are only tools and are abstract.  They aren't real (concrete) and aren't the things they represent.  The word "tree" doesn't help us understand trees.  Often words divide people even though they are used for communication.  We apply words and labels to ourselves and each other.  Maybe we call someone a Democrat, but that only limits - maybe prevents - our understanding of them as a person.  And it is using a word and category ready-made, handed down to us by the political system, which wants to divide people amongst themselves.  As just one example.

It seems in your second paragraph that you are making my point.  Why complicate it with more discussion and questions and words?  This will not help.  I'm not saying words or consciousness has anything to do with whether or not everything is one thing.  Everything is one thing *regardless* of words or concepts or consciousness.  We can talk about the complexities of language, but it will get us further from the point.  And that itself is my point.  A child doesn't know how to speak, hasn't yet learned the words.... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As long as views and perspectives supply the meaning then you can probably find meaning of some sort here or there.  But views and perspectives come after reality itself.  Existence precedes essence.  Artificial rites of man might have meaning, but like everything, it is ultimately in the eye of the beholder.  To look at meaning as a pejorative thing is problematic.  Meaningful is, in itself, no better and no worse than meaningless.  

Trees don't mean anything.  Nature doesn't mean anything.  Meaning is artificial. </TEXT>

1. Why take Blake out with 3 minutes left, even if you put him back in with 2 minutes left?  

2. Why have DJ sit so much the 4th quarter?  When DJ and Blake are both in there, they don't double Blake as much or as well, and DJ is a huge presence on defense.  Etc....

3. Why play Rivers so much?  We could have put Crawford, Reddick, and Barnes in there together.  They are all better shooters and better defenders than Rivers.

4. Why not intentionally foul Howard earlier in the possessions toward the end? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Brady and Kraft are goddamn liars and cheaters. 

Kraft and Brady denied everything and say they fully cooperated.  We now know, what we assumed all along, that is false.  They also know that Goodell will cover for them as much as possible.  Goodell incentivizes their cheating.  Now we get a report of an "investigation" after four months, timed to be released after the draft, that concludes with words like "probable" and "generally"?  WTF!? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is excellent.  Man gets caught up in form, which in nature is ultimately incidental (for lack of a better word).  Form can be illusion or disguise.  I am writing a paper on this, and other things right now.  It is quite timely to come across this post.  It is the flip side of the wu wei:  Natural order from within assumes a form that is determined from within, not from without.  I didn't know form was addressed explicitly in Taoist text this way though.  Thanks. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No, Bernie Sanders is actually quite anti-Fed himself, though not as much as Ron Paul.  And he's against the big banks quite aggressively, much more than Ron Paul is (though Paul was against the bail-outs).  Of course the Fed and the big banks aren't the same entity.  The big banks are actually themselves different entities.  (My post didn't suggest otherwise.)  Though, in effect, the Fed and the banks usually act in unison, especially with regard to Congress. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> On the subject of CP3 drawing fouls:

He can force contact and exaggerate it. But, unlike Parker and especially Ginobili, he doesn't sacrifice the whole play. Meaning he doesn't loose the ball. So if the foul isn't called, he keeps playing, usually without picking up his dribble. Ginobli will initiate contact as his first option, then do his gymnastics, flail, then flop, the ball missing the basket by a mile. I have no respect for that.  </TEXT>

For instance [this](http://deadspin.com/something-weird-is-going-on-with-randy-gregory-1701010088) and [this](http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2015/04/29/confusing-reports-emerge-about-randy-gregory/).

No way do we need any drama.  And no way is Reggie the guy to roll the dice.

That said, I sure feel sorry for the guy. At least he will get to the NFL eventually.  </TEXT>

King was against the war in Vietnam.  LBJ was for the war, as were war contractor buddies in Texas like George Brown, who helped start LBJ's political career.  Brown was one of the biggest war contractors of all time.
