	<TEXT> Funny you should mention that. 

I voted for Udall specifically because of his stance on abortion. 

After all, women who are conservative or libertarian are not as likely to have an abortion as women who are leftists. 

As a result, liberalized abortion laws and free or subsidized abortion can only work in the long-term favor of the pro-liberty outlook. 

:-)

In fact, since you have stumbled upon the notion of aborting your political adversaries before they can do you the disservice of saying things on Reddit that make you dispeptic, I've actually given you an upvote.

Congrats, Oscar! 

A winner is you! </TEXT>

Furthermore, even the Colorado Secretary of State has voiced concerns over voter-related shenanigans.

Of course, it's hilarious to see people like you claim that showing an ID to vote induces voter disenfranchisement, but you have no problem whatsoever not only forcing people to show an ID, but also to drive to specific locations, pay the modern equivalent of a poll tax, and fill out ridiculous amounts of paperwork just to loan a rifle to a buddy for a hunting trip.

Current military leaders are constantly trying to guess what the next strategic threats are, and to prepare for a situation where they're not stuck fighting the next war with the last war's tactics and methodologies.

Not you, though. No. You want to fight the next war with the last, last, last, last, last, last, last, last war's tactics and methodologies because you think that putting a bayonet on your (I'm guessing here) surplus Mosin and/or SKS looks badass. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Its already illegal to sell a gun to a prohibited person. Even without a UBC law, your scenario would play out pretty much the same, with both criminals going to jail. 

If you actually gave a shit about reducing gun crime, you'd actually make it easier for anyone to conduct a background check and simply allow anyone to submit a NICS request without forcing them to go through an FFL, or you'd mandate that government issued IDs should be conspicuously marked so that anyone can ascertain the legality of the purchaser at a glance in the same way that licenses are marked to easily tell if someone is of legal drinking age or not. 

Of course, as a supporter of gun control, you're completely  incapable of seeing gun owners as anything other than an adversary to mock and harass, so it wouldn't actually occur to you too treat then as anything other than untrustworthy potential criminals, rather than as people who have a vested interest in reducing violent crime, and who could be allies in achieving that goal.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Tl;dr: your stats can be right, but you can still use them to lie. 

This is one of my favorite tactics employed by the advocates of gun control because it's a very clever tactic of using a lie by omission in order to support the typical left-wing tactic of outgrouping those you dislike. 

It's actually quite clever, but I'll do my best to unpack their argument and point out the flaws. 

The thing you should take note of is that the article only talks about a decline in one thing: the rate of gun ownership. 

Nowhere does it mention a decline in the raw numbers of gun owners, and there's a very good reason for that: solo long as they stick to talking about rate, they're right. 

However, trying to claim a decline in raw numbers would be a lie. 

Let's break it down with a simple example. 

Let's say you have a town with a population of 100, and 45 of the people in that town are gun owners, which gives you a gun ownership rate of 45%.

In the next year, the town's population grows to 150, and the number of gun owners grows to a total of 60. If you run the numbers, you'll see that the town now has a gun ownership rate of 40%, which is a decline of 5%.

In the next year, let's say the town's population grows to 200, and the number of gun owners grows to a total of 70. Running the numbers, we find that gives us a gun ownership rate of 35%, yet another 5% drop from the previous year, and a whopping 10% drop from the first year! 

But if we look at the growth of just gun owners from year one to year three, we see that the number of gun owners have grown by 55.5%!

How can this be? 

Well, the overall population is almost always going to grow faster than any underlying sub group, whether that's gun owners, runners, or people into collecting Pokemon. 

For the overall rate of gun owners to show a positive rate of growth, it would be necessary for there to be a great percentage of new gun owners than new people, PLUS an added number of people on top of that too push the rate past equilibrium. That's pretty unlikely to happen, no matter what sub group you choose.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Assuming your information is correct, its completely possible for the general population to grow faster than the specific subset of the population that are gun owners.

As a result, it's quite possible that the numbers of gun owners to be growing, but the statistics would make that group appear to be shrinking because the population of gun owners is growing at a slower rate than the overall population.

There are plenty of other indicators that you're wrong as well. For instance, the numbers of people getting concealed carry licenses continue to grow, safety classes for first-time gun buyers are routinely filled to capacity, and new shooting ranges are being constructed at an explosive rate.

If the ranks of gun owners are shrinking, then you wouldn't see any of those things happening. </TEXT>

If they've got a valid permit, it shows that they've successfully passed a criminal background check in the past and that they've got a clean criminal history.

I'm not making stuff up. Do you honestly think the average cop is going to be aware enough of the law that they're going to say "Oh, well, that's ok, because I'm a walking copy of "Black's Law Dictionary" and I'm completely aware of all of the exceptions."

No, of course not. They'll cuff you, and haul your ass in and let a judge determine if you were in violation of the law or not. 

"Entrap" does have a specific meaning that doesn't apply, here.

Fine. Harass will work just as well. That said, grammar pedantry is one of the laziest forms of trolling.

Lol. I just don't believe in the conventional pro-gun circle jerk group-think, is all. So, of course, any contrary (or contrarian) opinion must be an anti-gun troll.

Except you actually are a troll, as clearly evidenced by the fact that you consistently support idiotic things like a law that would make it a crime to fail to report a gun within an extremely short period of time.

Such laws, with no history of demonstrating measurable or significant decreases in violence, and being unenforceable against violent criminals who will simply flaunt it, serves only to act as a way to harass citizens who are only guilty of exercising a civil right.

Of course, if you actually aren't an anti-gun troll, you're certainly welcome to post links to demonstrate otherwise.

You leave town on vacation for two weeks. Unbeknownst to you, a criminal breaks into your home, compromises your safe and steals your guns on the first night you're out of town. 

You don't find out the guns are missing until after you return from your vacation, and upon reporting the stolen firearms to the police, you are arrested for failing to report the guns stolen within the 72 hour time frame. 

That is just the most obvious example of how such a law is clearly meant to harass and entrap legal gun owners.

Lead exposure from shooting is easy to mitigate by shooting at an outdoor range, or an indoor range with OSHA-compliant ventilation.

Other than that, following basic hygiene principles like washing your hands and refraining from eating while at the range will easily reduce lead exposure to safe levels.

Of course, if you've got proof of an epidemic of lead poisoning occurring among shooters involved with various junior programs, I'd certainly like to see it. </TEXT>

It's not going to work 100% of the time, but it will work far more often than supporting the ideological politician who is 100% progun, but who has little chance of actually winning.

In the case of a Romney presidency, even assuming Romney would have signed a new AWB, you can be sure that the same strategy would be applied on down the line from the most senior Republican senator to the most junior freshman Republican House Rep.

From a strategic standpoint, it will always be in the interest of the NRA to participate in political races and to back the most likely winners.

	<TEXT> The NRA is going to support the candidate who is
1.) Most likely to win.
2.) Support gun rights.

Romney was and is anti-gun, but there's a strategy to the NRA's support for him. The NRA has a lot of money to buy ads that are favorable to a candidate like Romney. They're also able to turn out a significant number of highly engaged voters during election time.

So, let's imagine if the election had turned out differently and Romney had actually beaten Obama:

A guy like Romney may be an outright psychopath and a gun grabber, but he's not stupid. Once the election is won, all of those millions of dollars in ad buys and millions of NRA votes are accounted for.

When a gun control law ends up on the President's desk, the NRA is going to have a little conversation along the lines of "Hey, Mitt, remember all those commercials we ran for you, and positive coverage we gave to you in our media outlets, and all of the NRA members who showed up at the polls for you? Well, we did you a solid, and now it's your turn to do us a solid and veto that bill."

Even though a guy like Romney doesn't care about gun rights or gun owners, all of the support given to him by the NRA makes for a compelling reason to veto any bills the NRA doesn't like.

And of course, there's always the implied threat. "Hey, Mitt, we supported you when you needed us, if you don't do the same, well, we'll make sure you can't win the next primary."

So, from that standpoint, it's much more advantageous for the NRA to strategically support candidates who are likely to win, even if they aren't the perfect pro-gun candidate, because their support buys a lot of influence and clout, and even if that candidate isn't a fan of gun rights, he's well aware of the fact that NRA support makes it easier for him to win elections.

TL;DR: It's better to support a winner you can negotiate with, than a loser who's completely on your side. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> tl;dr:
Progressive ideology is rooted in tearing down old institutions and reshaping society in new and novel ways. Progressives hate gun ownership because it represents longstanding traditions, and your responsible gun handling will not dissuade them from hating you. Progressives are willing to cover for extremist Islam because it's new and novel to them, and the fact that it's non-western automatically makes it better than modern western civilization.

As a result, leftists will happily act as ambassadors for extreme Islam because it's new and novel, but will never, ever willingly acknowledge that there are positives to gun ownership because it's old and western.

----------------------

"Progressives" will always hate gun owners, and it has nothing whatsoever to do with your safe gun handling and everything to do with the philosophical underpinnings of liberal ideology, many of which are informed by the ideals of Marxism (during much of the early 20th century) and Postmodernism (late 20th century to now).

Left wing philosophy is fundamentally built on the notion that those things which have existed in society for long periods of time are fundamentally flawed, and must be torn down and done away with to make way for ideas, laws, and culture that are novel and new.

Among progressives, an understanding of history or *why* things have been done a certain way is unimportant. What the philosophy boils down to is "new is always better."

You can see this in nearly all forms of left-wing thinking, from economics (tear down capitalism) to feminism (tear down "the patriarchy") to environmentalism (tear down modern society) and on and on. Note that the outcomes from many of these changes aren't necessarily bad in and of themselves.

As such, gun owners are representative of a longstanding civil rights tradition that is deeply intertwined with the founding of the country. As such, civil rights, as embodied by the Bill of Rights, are completely anathema to the ideals of progressivism, and given that gun rights are steeped in traditions that are embedded into the founding of this nation, the average progressive has nothing but loathing for anyone who chooses to own a gun, and outright hatred for those who choose to do so for reasons that they don't personally approve of. The fact that you are responsible with your firearms *just simply doesn't matter to them because what they hate is the fact that guns are a very old school representation of a society they want to change in fundamental ways.*

So, in a nutshell, this is why leftists fundamentally oppose gun ownership and will never, ever recognize or care about the 99.995% of all gun owners are safe and responsible.

So what about the left's apologist stance regarding Islamism?

Well, if your default philosophical outlook is informed by the Postmodernist belief that your entire society is wrong about pretty much everything all of the time, and Multiculturalism has trained you to believe that all societies are equal, and that you, as a westerner, cannot possess the ability to reasonably articulate or even form valid criticism of other cultures, it becomes very easy for you to look outside of your own culture to find novel ways to inform your motives for implementing change in your society. (Remember, Progressive ideology is founded on novelty-seeking behavior and largely assumes that new = good and old/established = bad.)

Criticism of Islamism is a perfect example of where modern leftist ideology goes astray. In Islamism, you have a culture that is deeply rooted in beliefs that are brutally violent, horrendously racist and misogynistic, deeply subservient to religious authority, and aggressively willing to stamp out open inquiry and reason. Despite all of these plainly obvious drawbacks, Progressives will refuse to criticize, or in many cases, even acknowledge these problems because extremist Multicultural ideals have conditioned them to believe that criticizing other cultures is racist or can only flow from a place of western ignorance.

Because Islamism is foreign and strange to a westerner, it has the appearance of being novel and new to progressives, and since new always = better, you end up in a situation where supposedly forward-thinking intellectual types willingly act as apologists for a brutally violent and backward ideology. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Baking soda can be used to attenuate blood acidity, or acidosis. It gets included in a lot of workout supplements because it has some ability to mitigate "the burn" felt from intense exercise.

It's notable that the article doesn't mention the downsides to taking baking soda, which can politely be described as gastrointestinal distress, or more graphically described as inducing diarrhea and vomiting.

It can also cause problems for people with hypertension or those prone to panic attacks.

I suppose its something that might conceivably be used as part of a cancer treatment, if acidosis is a symptom or side effect of cancer or chemotherapy, but that's speculation on my part, and the author's claims that it's some kind of miracle cure are downright criminal.

If you're bored and want to read up on baking soda, then go here for all the fun you can possibly handle:

	<TEXT> The Makarov is a pistol that utilizes a straight blowback design to cycle the gun.

As a result of the design, there are no Makarovs that use 9x19mm as the cartridge generates too much pressure to safely use a straight blowback operating system. Also, despite the fact that both 9x18 Makarov and 9x19mm are ostensibly 9mm cartridges, there actually is a difference in the diameter of the bullets (.365 caliber vs. .355 caliber.)

Years ago, I read a magazine article where they attempted to fire 9x19mm through a Makarov with some unpleasant side effects, including a tremendous amount of felt recoil and the brass being battered to death. The authors explicitly stated that shooting 9x19 in a Makarov was a bad idea.

There were a number of Maks that were made to fire .380ACP, however, and these can sometimes be found on the secondary market. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> According to Wikipedia, the molecular formula for Sarin is C4H10FO2P.

If you want to ban the chemical precursors of Sarin nerve gas, you're going to have to throw everyone in jail who has in their possession any of the following: carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, flourine, or phosphorous.

Given that all humans are carbon-based life forms, that right there should be enough to trip your "imprison anyone with a precursor for Sarin" law.

God forbid they want to drink a glass of water. The average glass of water has both Hydrogen and Oxygen, and in many places, Flouride (an anion of Flourine.) In your world, you'd be calling out the bomb disposal squad and breathless media reporters every time anyone got the least bit parched.

Of course, I guess you'll have to throw all farmers in jail, since Phosphorus is a common ingredient in fertilizer, to say nothing of it's myriad industrial applications, and the fact that it's present in practically all matches.


In short, I'd like you to answer one question:

	<TEXT> I realize that you're an idiot, but I'd appreciate it if you didn't project your stupidity on me.

Of course there are forms of rape that don't involve direct physical violence or the threat of violence; drugging someone or taking advantage of someone who's drunk themselves into a stupor are clearly two examples of this.

But you must be completely touched in the head if you think that you can change the behavior of the kind of psychopath who'd rape a blackout drunk college coed by forcing them to sit through a 60-slide Power Point presentation that outlines the do's and don'ts of when it's ok to stick your dick in someone.

The kind of morals that will prevent someone from taking advantage of another person in such a situation get laid down and reinforced in childhood. Of course, leftist idiots in this country have done everything they can to disassemble the notion of instilling morals and ethical behavior into children, and then they get all butthurt 20 years later when their idiotic methodologies lead to 20-something dudebros who don't have any ethical problems with rape.

Of course, that's all fine and dandy so long as someone can get a financial grant to go out and show the aforementioned slide deck to the aforementioned dudebros, isn't it? </TEXT>

Even the most partisan tea party types grudgingly tolerated him.

It's been all down hill for him since the gun thing started, and his actions regarding the Nathan Dunlop case, lying to the sheriffs, and backtracking on legalizing weed haven't won him any friends.

His problem seems to be that he's trying to please DNC political party bosses to cement his next political career move, and in the process he's managed to piss off everyone from gun owners and law enforcement to pot heads and environmentalists.

Now that people are out to play political hardball because they no longer view Hick favorably, he doesn't know what to do, and his poor choices continue to compound. </TEXT>
