	<TEXT> "A DISABILITY worker has admitted a 13-year history of sexual abuse against some of the states most vulnerable people in a case that has shocked authorities.

Almost of all of Craig Gilbert Handasydes victims were unable to communicate, meaning they could never report the abuse.

One of his eight male victims was deaf, blind and mentally impaired.

The men, aged between 25 and 50, were abused between 1998 and 2011 while living in Department of Human Services disability supported accommodation.

Mr Handasyde, 47, was employed by DHS as a disability development services officer to care for the men."

	<TEXT> My whole point was that children (as in 9,12,14,15,17 year olds even) are easily fooled into believing the invisible real person they are actually communicating with is the love of their young life. 

I really am all in favor of parental monitoring of communications made by youngsters on the assorted devices and apps, and even more strongly so of the need for parents to guide   educate their children as concerns the use of real names, real school names, real town names etc etc,

I have played mmorpg games where I hear kids telling so much rl info to absolute strangers , I get all mama bear and lecture them.  On the other hand I have spent several years speaking to people online I have met in these places, have met some irl, love them   feel closer to some then to rl friends. But I am an adult, my shit-detector works fairly well. Not so much when I was 13.  </TEXT>

SAN JOS: Costa Rican authorities declared an emergency on Sunday after a ship carrying 180 tons of ammonium nitrate sunk off the country's Pacific coast.

The National Emergency Commission (CNE) urged people to avoid swimming at beaches and suspend fishing in the region off the port of Puntarenas, 90km west of the capital.

The CNE said the accident occurred on Saturday when the boat sank in heavy seas. Two crew members were rescued without incident, the CNE said.

Ammonium nitrate is often used in the manufacture of fertilizers and explosives, and can be dangerous to health in cases of direct contact with the chemical.  AFP </TEXT>

CHECK YOUR KIDS FACEBOOKS FOR SEX OFFENDERS AMONG THEIR FRIENDS LIST (ty Trench)

Thanks to this article from KYW Radio in Philadelphia (Come on South Jersey and Philly peeps sing along with TrenchKYWNews Radio1060) I was introduced to a Facebook app called Friend Verifier. Its an app that allows you to check your kids Facebook friends list for sex offenders.

The first thing youll need is a Friend Verifier account which is free. The second thing youll need is the login and password of the Facebook account youll be checking. Remember, youre the parent. You should already have all of your kids logins.

Log in to your childs Facebook account then go to the Friend Verifier website log in to your FV account then click on the button that says Scan all friends for sex offenders. It doesnt hurt to check your own Facebook friends list either. Thankfully mine came up empty but I can say that at least in that way it works.

However even Friend Verifier will tell you that not every search is perfect and may miss a sex offender in their scan due to whatever information is already out there.

Wile FV is a great tool no tool is perfect and once again I remind you that as a parent youre the only true defense between online predators and your kids."


and "Again I say to parents its up to you on whether or not you want to allow your kids to have Snapchat on their phones or tablets. However I urge you that if you do make frequent checks on their friends list to make sure that no adult is contacting them for sexual reasons."

From the story he wrote re the dad using kik: "Now Im not saying that Kik should be driven out of business or anything like that. Kik is just a tool but its the way that others use that too that you should be aware of in order to better protect your kids."

I'm not even going to mention the Craig's List   Backpage horrors.

	<TEXT> wow, this is seriously awful.  I'm so sorry for the difficulties you are going through. It doesn't sound as if those that have the power to make change happen care at all.  The world really needs to wake up and see what these seemingly small and localized water lack situations are adding up to.

Start saving any rain water you might get, cover it tightly so as to help prevent mosquito borne illness. 

Reuse the water you wash with to water any garden you may have. 

Please people, stand up for those being affected by the lack of water in Puerto Rico now; we very well may be next if action isn't taken rapidly.

	<TEXT> "SPRINGFIELD TOWNSHIP, OH (WOIO) - A 35-year-old Springfield Township man was arrested after he confessed to using nude photos of his own children online. 

The man originally turned himself in to officers stating that he had only traded photos of himself with others on the social media app, Kik. Kik is an instant messaging app where you can send pics and video to any other user in seconds on any smart phone. Last year it had 120 million users, many being teenagers.

Detectives were able to later determine that the suspect also traded nude photos of his two teens. The material was traded with both juveniles and adults. 

Detectives have been in contact with the FBI to assist further in the investigation. 
The father is now charged with two felonies. He's sitting in the Summit County Jail on a $100,000 bond. He's due back in court next month.

19 Action News has decided not to identify the man to protect the identity of his kids. "

Please be on top of what your children are doing on line with these types of apps. It's the way that others use that too that you should be aware of in order to better protect your kids. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> ASTANA -- Kazakhstan has suspended poultry imports from neighboring Russian region of Astrakhan, citing an outbreak of H5N1 bird flu there.

The Kazakh Ministry of Agriculture announced on April 30 that the poultry imports had been suspended as of April 28.

Last week, Kazakh authorities temporarily banned Russia-made butter, chocolate, candies, and mayonnaise, while Russian agricultural watchdog Rosselkhoznadzor barred the import of 20 tons of wheat flour from Kazakhstan.

Earlier in April, Russian authorities suspended Kazakh dairy products imports to Russia.

Some media reports in Russia and Kazakhstan have called the situation a "trade war" between the two countries, which are close trade partners and founding members of a four-nation Eurasian Economic Union created this year on the basis of an existing customs union.

In separate statements last week, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov and Kazakh Deputy Economy Minister Qaiyrbek Oskenbaev said that there is no trade war and that the bans were motivated purely by health concerns.  </TEXT>

"The Seattle Times reports:

"A day of peaceful May Day rallies for immigrant rights in Seattle turned chaotic Friday night as a separate anti-capitalist march descended into clashes between police and protesters on Capitol Hill.
"Three officers were injured and admitted to Harborview Medical Center. Several protesters reported injuries from pepper spray and projectiles fired by police. Sixteen people were arrested."
Member station KUOW reports: "The day began with a small Black Lives Matter gathering at Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Park. Those people then joined the annual May Day March for Workers and Immigrant Rights. It began at Judkins Park in the Central District then headed downtown for a rally at the Federal Courthouse."

"According to The Associated Press: "Earlier demonstrations in Seattle and Portland, Oregon, to decry racism and income inequality were largely peaceful, but protesters who gathered later in the day confronted police, who attempted to keep them from damaging property and disrupting traffic."

at least they made note that the black lives matter portion was peacefully conducted.

baby steps I suppose. But your point is well made. I didn't see any reports of looting/fire starting either, both of which make matters so much more news-able (yep I invented that word).

Idk. Were there any fires set/looting that went unreported? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm assuming the dog was infected by fleas.  However:  

"...Four days later, the dog's owner entered the hospital with a fever and a bloody cough that became worse over the next few hours, but an initial blood culture was misidentified, according to the CDC report.

As the patient's symptoms grew worse, the test was redone and he was found to have been infected with pnumonic plague, according to the CDC report. The remains of the dog were also tested and were found to be positive for the plague bacteria.

"Frankly one of the biggest surprises of this outbreak is the source," said John Douglas, of Tri-County Health Department in Colorado and one of the study authors. "Primarily ... dogs dont get sick at all or they get a minor illness," after being infected with the plague.

Janine Runfola, of the Tri-County Health Department in Colorado and lead author of the report, explained that cats are more likely to infect humans with the disease than dogs because they exhibit more symptoms.
"For pneumonic plague a more likely scenario would be you have a cat [play] with prairie dogs and infected fleas get on the cat," Runfola said. "The cat gets sick and sneezes and coughs on its owner."

"The plague is caused by the bacteria Yersinia pestis, and can infect the body in different ways. For example a flea bite can lead to infection of the glands, which is called bubonic plague -- notorious for the epidemics it spawned during the Middle Ages in Europe. Because this plague was spread from dog to owner through coughing, it developed into pneumonic plague, according to Douglas.

The plague is known to be endemic to prairie dogs in the American Southwest, which can then lead to isolated outbreaks of the disease in domestic animals or humans. </TEXT>
