The rest of crypto, he is glad to write about, but his articles show that he understands it quite poorly or even erroneously. Every time he opens his mouth or publishes something, he pretty much self-identifies himself as a first class moron. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Some of them come to the US after a successful (half or part) career in Japan or Korea, so by the time they get here, they're older than your average rookie. Maintaining that quality at such a high level is tough for more than a few years for any pitcher. And in general, the quality of those Asian leagues is still AA or AAA at best, so there still aren't many who rise to major league quality level. There are some that have lasted a while, such as Hideo Nomo or Chan Ho Park. </TEXT>

Probably the latter, since he's going to make some ugly headlines and say some nasty things at debates that characterize the extreme wing.

	<TEXT> I agree with xeroc. And do your own research. If you're relying on forum posters to win you over with the best argument, that's an inferior way to inform yourself about important subjects. My answer: one relies on big wigs and bots; the other uses the free market to hold its peg in a decentralized exchange. To be fair, both are useful innovations. </TEXT>

I'm in favor of leaving the hall part up to voters, though, because those voters have shown discretion about the steroid-era candidates already. No chance Pete gets in now.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hate to say it, but you just described BitShares pretty well. I'm a big fan of Bitcoin; Satoshi himself admitted it wasn't designed to be used for instant transactions, etc. If you use Bitcoin in combination with BitUSD through the BitShares decentralized exchange, as Roger Ver indicated in a recent video, you can have scalability, instant transactions, zero volatility, and keep your Bitcoin.  </TEXT>
