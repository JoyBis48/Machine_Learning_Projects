	<TEXT> In the late 60s.

Well, let's look at the crime stats. These are national - your own area may be more or less safe than this.

http://www.disastercenter.com/crime/uscrime.htm

In 1969 there were 7.3 rapes and 18.5 "forcible rapes" for every 100,000 people. In 2013 the numbers were 4.5 and 25.2, respectively - and there's some serious evidence to suggest that rapes haven't increased, but reporting has. (Certainly, the FBI numbers on rape will start to change now that they count rapes of males instead of just of females.)

In some areas, the numbers are slightly higher than they were in 1969. However, they show a marked decrease from the highs in the 1980s and 90s. 

The truth is that the US has been experiencing a decrease in crime for the past decade and a half by now. There are many ideas for why this might be. Me, I favor the lead hypothesis - an increase in leaded gasoline caused low levels of led poisoning in crowded urban areas, which cased an increase in violent crime 20 years down the line, and when we removed lead from gasoline we saw a corresponding decrease 20 years after that. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No, actually, not only is it not lower in the UK but studies conducted in the UK show that numbers of adult autistics mirror those of young autistics.

However, when you were a child, more "low functioning" autistics were more likely to be institutionalized or at least taught separately and more "high functioning" autistics frequently didn't get a diagnosis of any sort. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It is extraordinarily unlikely that at this point autism (discounting Fragile X) will be found to be caused by a single gene. Evidence is pointing to autism, like height, being a multi-gene trait.

 First the hooded hostage, and then she doesn't even have the decency to tell Major "Hey Ravi is working on a cure, so we just need to be patient and wait and keep eating dead people brains for a little while and everything will be alright."

That would mean fessing up that Ravi's been lying to him as well.

 Holy shit, suddenly everyone thinks only you can save your brother, yet only you know that you CANT. How is she going to explain that she can't give her blood?

Fess up that she has contracted the sort of disease that prevents you from donating blood. She hasn't told anybody because she wanted to handle it herself. She doesn't have to state that it's Zombieism. She could easily hint it's HIV, that can linger in the body for ages (especially with treatment) before it manifests as AIDS. There are other disease that preclude donation, such as hepatitis or TB, but her mother would probably recognize that she doesn't have those symptoms. </TEXT>

 Most of us probably have seen meteors or shooting stars. A meteor is the flash of light that we see in the night sky when a small chunk of interplanetary debris burns up as it passes through our atmosphere. "Meteor" refers to the flash of light caused by the debris, not the debris itself.

	<TEXT> Strangely, not. While we don't know exactly what percentage of the population has mosaicism, some studies show that it's more common among transgender individuals - they literally have some cells xx and some xy. 

And there are a surprising number of people out there who present externally as female but are xy. Nobody does a gene test before naming the baby. They just glance at the body and move on.

Not to mention the fact that there are some differences in brain structure from male to female, and transgender individuals have brain structures more like the "opposite" sex than their assigned gender. 

Science shows us that transgender is based on real, provable things.

Regardless, I fail to see how your argument has merit. Let's say they were absolutely making things up. Does it harm you to say "she" instead of "he"? Of course not! So why spend over an hour on reddit commenting about it? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Science actually doesn't have an opinion, which is good, because science shows that a surprising number of people with external genitalia that appears to be female are male, and that there are a large number of people with two sets of genes in their bodies. We're only just now finding out how common mosaicism is, and the answer to that is "more than we thought". </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  People can believe whatever they want to do. It just doesn't make it true.

Indeed. You, for example, believe that somebody's genetic makeup is more important than their self-identification. You believe that something you say you don't care about is more important than good manners. You believe that this sort of argument is more important than other people's happiness and general well-being.

I believe you're a nitwit. One of the two of us is right in our beliefs. It's not you </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Look, if you came up to me and said "squeek squeek I'm a squirrel", all I'd say is "You want a peanut?"

This is not the hill I'm willing to die on. If somebody tells me they're a man or a woman, it's a lot easier - and certainly more polite - to just go "yup, okay" than to argue with them. Because they care and *I don't*. So why not go with the flow? It's not important to me, after all.

Edit: Peanuts and sunflower seeds are not good for squirrels. Do not give peanuts to squirrels. Excessive consumption of peanuts is linked to bone deformities in squirrels. If you want to feed the squirrels, tree nuts are a better choice, along with lentils, seeds, and dried corn in moderation. Some fresh fruit will also not go amiss. I use the term simply because it is more euphonious than "You want some pecans and maybe a small amount of lentils?" </TEXT>

And nobody ever mentions this episode, as near as I can tell. Well, that Tuvok was slightly more willing to go with the procedure than Tuvix had been. Why the heck did Voyager do the same plot twice with the same character? </TEXT>

Likewise, their Cardassian counterparts had no fear of reprisals by the Maquis for anything Cardassia did. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You know, I never got that episode. I mean, if you accept the premises it's a great ep, but the premises don't make any sense.

Crazy cult leader talks about how "we have more supporters than you think", and indeed, *somebody* (who didn't deign to travel with them) invented that device. (And a different group of people with broadly similar aims sabotaged Risa that time - really, I'd love to have seen Star Trek tackle its malcontents more.)

There must be billions and billions of humans in the Federation, and god knows how many other biologically compatible (you know, fertility-wise) species. Even if her actual number of supporters was a ludicrously low percentage, she surely could have gotten actual *volunteers* to live in her low-tech colony in the boondocks. Even if they couldn't get an official Federation charter, they could've still "crashed" the ship in the usual way, except they all would have been more prepared for roughing it.

Even for a crazy cult leader with delusions of grandeur, she certainly doesn't seem to have approached this logically. </TEXT>
