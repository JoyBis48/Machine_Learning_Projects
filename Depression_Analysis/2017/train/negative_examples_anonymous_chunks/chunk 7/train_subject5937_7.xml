	<TEXT> One of the largest economies in world has a stock market that goes from 2030 to 5023 from June last year to June this year, then drops 30% in a few weeks, then the government steps in with $billions to try to prop it back up, and you think it's "big whoop"?

So what is your astute investment prediction in that market?  </TEXT>

On Saturday, China's 21 largest brokerage firms said they would spend a whopping 120 billion yuan (about $19.3 billion) to try to stabilize the market

Chinese stocks plummeted yet again on Tuesday morning, defying rapid-fire emergency support measures from Beijing and raising concerns about policy makers' ability to stabilise one of the most highly volatile markets in the world. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  The fact that he has no belief system doesn't bother me

If you don't mind me asking, in my own relationship I found this very troubling - - how is it that his not being on a path to "salvation" (or whatever you want to call it) doesn't bother you? And beyond that, if you stay together and have children, how would you feel about him convincing them to be atheist? 

I ask because I have wrestled with these issues myself.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I hope you take this in the spirit it is meant. While my ex was the one that was very disrespectful within our relationship (see my other post in this thread) I had difficulties with her beliefs as well.

To sum it up, the majority of Christians have a belief in an afterlife that is conditional on your behavior (yes, I've really oversimplified, but please go with me on this). 

It can be very difficult to see the person you love most as being on a path that does not lead to the afterlife that you believe in. So, while a Christian may initially say they are OK with you being an atheist, be aware - - belief is a powerful force, and as time goes on, it can really mess with how one sees their partner.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not a direct answer, but here's some more Reddit related info from [The Seattle Times](http://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/reddit-moderators-shut-down-parts-of-site-over-employees-dismissal/)

Reddit sells large, targeted advertising campaigns that run at the top of individual subreddits.

The events come at a particularly inauspicious time for Reddit, which only a week ago celebrated its 10th anniversary. Last year, Reddit raised $50 million in venture capital and planned to use the money for hiring and refining the advertising business.

The site has been valued at roughly $250 million, according to a recent disclosure by its lawyers. Advance Publications, the parent company of Cond Nast, still owns a majority of the company and retains a board seat.

The company has had its problems during the past year. Yishan Wong abruptly resigned in November as Reddits chief executive after a dispute with the companys board of directors.

Reddit has also taken steps to combat harassment on and off its site, moves that many members of the community complain have stifled the principles of free speech upon which the site was founded.

There has also been tension between factions of the Reddit community and Ellen Pao, the companys interim chief executive, whom many Reddit users blame for imposing the anti-harassment policies. An online petition asking Pao to step down has garnered more than 13,000 signatures.

Reddit users have also questioned Paos ability to lead the company while dealing with major issues in her personal life. For nearly two years, Pao was embroiled in a well-publicized discrimination lawsuit against Kleiner Perkins Caufield   Byers, the venture-capital firm. Pao lost that case in March. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes. I looked it up myself, and the length of time between sunsets does vary significantly throughout the year. This is *so* not intuitive to me. 

But the times I get are different than yours (I might be doing the math wrong). I get 2 hours 23 min today, and 2 hours 56 min. at Christmas. 

I think this is correct since the Earth is about 24,000 miles around, so you'd need to travel about 1000 mph (at equator) to keep up with the sun. Less at relevant latitudes.

	<TEXT> From your post, Donald said the following: 

"When Mexico *sends* its people, they're not *sending* their best"

"They're *sending* people that have lots of problems"

"They're rapists."

Do you seriously not have any issues with this?

You really see this as a "realistic if not aggressive observation on socio-geo-political conditions"? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Story time. When I was a kid I was given a really nice mechanical pencil. I loved it, and used it in school all the time. As I'm sure many of you can relate, assignments were just a bit more enjoyable when using an instrument of beauty. So one day it gets stolen, and it really bummed me out. I kept an eye out, and sure enough I eventually see a kid in another class using my pencil. I confront him and he says it's his. I give him one last chance, and he digs in.

So by now the teacher has come over because I'm pretty pissed off. He still claims it's his. So I ask the teacher to remove the eraser and take out the paper underneath it. It reads "This belongs to train_subject5937". 

Busted! </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Not really, unless you are satisfied with upvoting everyone who isn't spamming because they are technically contributing the the discussion in one way or another.

 Isn't this the same rationale against the downvoting? (There is indiscriminate downvoting to otherwise appropriate content).

Did you really just quote the entire post to which you are replying? Why would you do that? </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Another problem a downvote bot causes it it discourages people from posting, and it makes the subreddit feel way more hostile to a new user. Even if it doesn't modify the placement on the 'new' page, it kills me to see posts at 0 or -1 points when they don't deserve it.

 I understand this sentiment, but it is overcome so quickly by other users upvoting it (if it is appropriate content).
 Both sides have good points and overall I am just concerned about any form of potential "censorship." I am kind of in a if its not too broke lets not fix it mentality in regards to the downvotes.

Quote much bro? </TEXT>
