	<TEXT> [This study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3298261/) examined dogs in a 2001-2002 outbreak in Gabon and seems to be the main source of information on this, and yes, dogs can be asymptomatically infected.

There is a very interesting thing in this paper:

 dogs appear to be the first animal species shown to be naturally and asymptomatically infected by Ebola virus. 

Needless to say, it would be *very* useful to know the biological mechanisms involved in that.

(edit: emphasis added)

 The infection event is still under investigation; **she went twice into the patient's room**: once to assist him and then after the former patient died. No accidental contact was reported.

 The infected nurse went on vacations the day after the former patient pased away. Her husband is being questioned to elaborate a list of people with who she was in contact.

 First symptoms (temperature under 38.6C) were reported on September 30th. She has been controlled twice a day since then. She mostly stayed at home. </TEXT>
