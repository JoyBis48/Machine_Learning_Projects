And I know it has some .org website url at the bottom of it but my hubsand drove away too fast for me to see the damn thing. This is the second time I've seen it and I want to know what exactly it means. I tried google but it's bringing up absolutely nothing relevant. Thanks! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Leave cat food out regularly. Eventually he will get used to your presence and let you get closer to him. Assuming he is not feral he will start to trust you and eventually let you pet him.  I have had several neighborhood cats decide to "move in" in this fashion.

Just wanted to add this process may take weeks or even months so don't worry if it doesn't happen right away </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My husband does stuff around the house. I didn't have a problem cleaning when I was unemployed, but he has always done all the cooking so I  have always cleaned up after dinner and washed dishes. I figured that was fair 50/50. 

But recently I have started working, so since I am cleaning all day at work, I don't really want to clean when I get home, too. So he will usually wash dishes and do cat litter and make the bed on the days I work, and I will do it on my days off as well as catch up on doing any other general house cleaning that needs done (vacuuming, mopping, laundry, cleaning the bathroom)


ALSO just wanted to add that sometimes I have to rewash the dishes since he doesn't always wash the bottom of plates or get all the grease off, etc. so you are not alone. lol

I don't think it's unrealistic to expect men to do their fair share. If they were living alone they would have to do it anyway. Also if  their wife/girlfriend is sick or just had surgery, they should know how to do it.  I just had surgery and couldn't do anything for two weeks. 
If it was up to him he would probably let stuff pile up but I am slightly ocd when it comes to cleaning standards. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I straight up told my ex-boyfriend that bdsm was important to me. If he wanted to try it, good. If not, well I will probably end up leaving you for someone who will.

It was heartless for me to say but I was being 100% honest.
I did end up leaving him for someone else, but it was years down the road.  

In my mind, sex isn't the most important thing in a relationship, but it is important.  Not only was the sex bad but we had other problems as well. So it would be simplistic to say that I left him because of sex and the lack of kink.  But he could have at least had enough consideration to try.

It's not like I wanted to tie him up and use a strap on with him, but a little role playing isn't too much to ask, right? lol </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  As far as the kidnapping though, the state would have to prove he kept her against her will and I doubt they would throw resources into a scenario like this.

	<TEXT> The best approach would be getting involved in the local bdsm community. Usually they have munches and you can get to know everyone.  They usually don't let just anyone in off the street and have known each other for years, making sure shit like this doesn't happen on their watch. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Your mentality disgusts me. What if this was your daughter? Wife? Mother?  Yes, meeting strangers off the internet can be dangerous. I'm sure she has "learned her lesson". 

If the rapist truly knew what the fuck he was doing he would have made her sign a contract. While she may have agreed to having sex involving rape play, she did not consent to being held prisoner for three days. She did not consent to being anally raped. BOTH people were not going about this the correct way. A detailed discussion of hard limits should have been conducted beforehand and a safeword so that when he crossed the line she would at least have the opportunity to signal her distress. Whether that would have stopped him or not. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It may take years to fully process. When I was raped I believed for years that I deserved it.  Of course years later it was interfering with my having a healthy sex life as I would have flash-backs in the middle of sex and freeze up, start crying, etc.  Whether you feel guilty or not, it's still going to be a psychological trauma. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> YES. When meeting someone online you need to have a friend who you call to check in with who can then call the police if you do not keep in touch with. Obviously since this was a rape scenario they couldn't meet in a public place but for anyone who may be reading please get to know the person in person beforehand and make sure they are not going to abuse your trust. </TEXT>
