	<TEXT> That completely makes sense. Characters change over time. None of the Friends were as two-dimensional as they were in Season 1 in Season 6. But, take the Simpsons, the characters slowly improved over the first decade or so, but then they devolved into stupid charictures of themselves and worst of all, it wasn't as entertaining. 

That's how I feel about Community, except by Season 6 and it has retained the same writers. Yes, these characters are expected to grow and change, but I think the way they've grown is pure shit. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Does the characterisation on this show annoy anyone else? </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> This may be the worst place to discuss this, but I'm watching Season 6 and it's really pissing me off. At the start Britta seemed kind of clever and likable, but slowly devolves into a dumb, pot-smoking, hippie. Then she switches back and forth every other episode. Abed used to be the cute kid with Asperger's, but by Season 3, he is just a vehicle for meta-jokes and an excuse to cannibalise other shows. Pierce started off really funny, but by the end his racism was no longer endearing and just cringe-worth (probably collateral damage from Season 4 though). Chang is just an excuse for a few one-liners here and there. Frankie-as-Yahoo was interesting for one mediocre episode, but it left her very bland later on in the season. More often then not, the show is too Jeff-centric to give the other characters anything meaningful to do in the A-Plot and I'm still not sure where I stand on his daddy-issues, narcissism, Jeff's need for his friends and his leadership skills. All of those things seem contradictory to me.

What's worse is Harmon seems to be aware of all of this and not give a damn. His self-aware brand of humour is consistently pointing out his awareness for these things and he doesn't do a damn thing to change it. It's worse when Harmon is just using characters as mouthpieces for things he doesn't like (Avengers, The Sting, Big Budget movies). It isn't subtle and the characters all suffer for it. I find the fact he only every does this to critise stuff really disheartening as well. Personally, I think it's kind of nihilistic how he never praises films through this. Sure, occasionally you'll get a Die Hard homage or what-have-you, but it feels more like a passing reference and more of a directorial decision.

The AV Club's review of Advanced Safety Features inadvertently highlights why this is such a problem for me.
I certainly wouldnt call Features one of the best episodes of Community, but its the first one of the season to completely reveal the shows core of sadness and sentimentality. Without that core, Community would be an alienating, smarter-than-thou, up-its-own-ass single-camera sitcom, and the world needs another one of those like it needs another Madea movie. 

For me, this sentiment all is sourced from the characters, but I feel the show is lacking it because it's characters suck and as a result it is an alienating, smarter-than-thou, up-its-own-ass single-camera sitcom.

So, anyone up for Madea? Madea? Madea? Madea? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The writing still has a little ways to go. I wish they would stop spelling everything out for us. Once they start doing that, it'll be a prestige drama.

My favourite example.
They open the boot of a car to find a walker with her legs and arms bound together. Maggie looks into the boot and begins contemplating what it means in silence. Carol comes over and says "She was trapped..."

That's fine and is still kind of subtle, but Carol's next line kills me.
"Like us."

However there is a lot of ambiguous symbolism in the show nowadays, certain in the episodes directed by Greg Nictero (easily the show's best director).

I think Daredevil will be prestige television come next season as the worst episodes were written by Steven DeKnight - which was a shame as I really like the man - and now he's left the show should improve. DeKnight did the same thing as The Walking Dead writers where he'd explain the hidden meanings behind everything and it bugged me. Also he directed the last episode which had some of the worst action in the series. It turned really superhero-y with a dependence on cinematic music and larger than life fight moves. It wasn't interesting to watch and wasn't helped by all of the jump cuts. Now that he's out of the picture, Daredevil will certainly be prestige drama.

I don't now whether many people like Agents of Shield on this sub, but I feel that having 22 episodes helped the plotting quite a bit. They divided the series into three distinct chunks - Search for the City, Skye Dealing with Power/Real Shield and the Inhumans - this meant there was room for some pretty complex plot webs and character work. People who were previously kinda boring became interesting thanks to having episodes dedicated to expanding on their character (looking at you Ward). The cast is also too big to deal with the 15-odd characters in 13 episodes. Coulson, Fitz-Simmons, Skye, Ward, Mack, Hunter, Mockingbird and May all got pretty decent arcs in Season Two and most of them would've been forgotten about if there was a 13 episode season.

Managing to tell three stories actually makes it similar to three four-issue comic book arcs which I guess is quite faithful to modern comics where everything is quite decompressed and it takes a while for things to pay off. This is kind of the opposite of the Flash which had a Silver-Age meets Claremont plotting; one wacky conflict every week with some soapy elements and foreshadowing future episodes. Agents of Shield tried this in Season One and it didn't really work, but come Season Two's more serialised plotting, it was a vastly improved show (helped that they got some decent directors and fight choreographers too). Also, [the dialogue is superb and constantly funny](http://imgur.com/a/VhB00). The last episode provided my [new favourite line in the MCU.](http://i.imgur.com/H6wz2Qq.gif)

Because of all of this really interesting character work and really complex plotting, I could make the case that would be prestige television with a few revisions. Namely the direction and the action. The directors need to get the actors to do more physically. They spend too much of the episode standing still with their arms crossed. They really need to be more active to present a similar energy to the rest of the MCU. The colouring is far too bland and reminds me too much of a crappy 90s Batman. I'd love to see much more colour on the show. Light blues and greens would really work in my opinion. Lastly, the action needs a lot of work. The slow-mo in the finale was timed dreadfully and had no weight to it. There are a few really great action moments - [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hReYNlIoIWE) and Face My Enemy come to mind, but often it's not really clear what's going on or Clark Gregg feels too much like a middle-aged guy playing pretend. I'd love to actually see Coulson get tired after a fight or get really out of breath. If this can be achieved, I think it'll be in the same league. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Captain America: The First Avenger and Super 8. I'm not sure how much more of an impact they'd have, but I think they'd be better received. They are the most Spielbergian films I've seen not directed by him or Robert Zemeckis. 

Also, if the Avengers had been released 3 decades ago, we would have had a myriad of shared universes in the 90s and they probably would have been done so poorly that the concept would have died off in the 00s. </TEXT>
