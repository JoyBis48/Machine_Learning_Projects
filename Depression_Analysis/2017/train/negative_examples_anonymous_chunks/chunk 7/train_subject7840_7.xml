	<TEXT> Not wanting to date a woman with hairy legs isn't on the same level as, say, refusing to date black women, but the thought process probably stems from (and certainly contributes to) our patriarchal society. That's not your fault, but it is something you need to be aware of and try to correct.

So, if your preference is for shaven legs, you're wrong and should change. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Washington dragged everyone into a literal war where tons of people died, though.

No he didn't.

Who decided Washington could start a massive conflict? Just him and his buddies, but apparently that doesn't matter for reasons.

He had little to do with starting a massive conflict.

But since Snowden leaked some documents with a minimum of harm to all except the egos of politicians in order to further a goal as noble ("people should have a degree of self-rule over their own lives"), it's the complete opposite and he's a total traitor for taking initiative like that?

I consider Snowden a traitor.  He released classified information of legal activities on the part of the NSA.  I'm happy John Oliver finally called him on the carpet regarding the consequences of his actions since reddit seems to treat him as a saint.

Snowden got trapped in Russia. Wasn't his fault. 

Yes it was.  He could have stood trial like anyone else that breaks the law.

because some American pols are being vindictive as fuck. 

That's not why he would stand trial.  He would stand trial because he broke the law. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Same question I asked jcar128, how can simply telling an officer I know my rights are being violated hurt more than help?

Officers have wide discretion on how to handle a traffic stop.  You could have committed three infractions but a cop might only ticket you for one since you were polite and respectful.

If you go through with your plan, the cops won't cut you any breaks.  When you go to court, the cop will communicate with the prosecutor regarding your behavior meaning the prosecutor won't cut you any breaks.

Also keep in mind you can be arrested and taken to a police station for something as small as speeding.  If you're annoying enough, a cop can do that, and it would not be illegal in the slightest. </TEXT>

Maybe.  Who cares?

How, in the eyes of the law, can an animal be treated at property for civil purposes, but as something more than just property in other circumstances?

They are treated as property that you have restrictions as to how you can treat it.  There's nothing wrong with this.  Legislators are allowed to to create laws that have specific categories.  There's nothing in the constitution that says "if something is property you cannot restrict how a person treats it!"  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  There is no sound reasoning to just sit here and admit guilt when i could fight it and potentially get it dropped. 

You are highly unlikely to succeed in fighting the ticket.

Instead, show up on your court date, dress nicely, be polite, and try to work out a deal with the prosecutor. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's likely that your employers believe that you just want to have long hair and are saying you're totally a Germanic pagan in an effort to avoid cutting your hair.

In order for your religious beliefs to be accommodated they would have to be bona fide religious beliefs.  These beliefs do not have to be reasonable, only sincerely religiously held.  A judge would likely look to the totality of your circumstances to determine if this is bona fide.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> TIn the United States, is it illegal to to through someone's phone without permission?

It depends very much on the circumstances.

Also, do the police only have rights that US citizens have when it comes to searching? If it would be illegal for a citizen, would it also be illegal for them?

No, of course not.  A citizen cannot walk into someone's house and start looking through their stuff.  A law enforcement officer can obtain a warrant and do just that. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  We want to see the questions answered, not a bunch of people competing for comedy upvotes.

Can you provide some other examples where people did not get any advice whatsoever? I read almost every thread and I can tell you that's a small small minority.  </TEXT>
