The visitors do that often and it is just by luck when I find out and shelve it correctly during my shift, and there is like one big audit a year for the public part of the library. Please, try to get books back to their place. </TEXT>

I wonder why, it defeats the purpose of having to kill your sis to obtain it. Solus Greatsword should be less powerful. </TEXT>

I liked Spore, but it could be a lot better. So much potential, and it was actually quite fun at times. I also regret buying Galactic Adventures, because I only tried them once or twice and never played it again.

	<TEXT> Imo videogames can be very enriching experiences. You can learn from them and try things you couldn't in real life, they provide catharsis from stress and much more.

 Sometimes I think that I waste my life with videogames, but other times I see that it is not necessarily bad. "Get a life" is a poor argument, because "getting a life" is not very well defined activity - I have a feeling that is mostly mean "be a complete square", because it is often used at gamers, anime fans and other such subcultures.

Of course it is not the real thing you, but you can draw insights and ideas from them, and it can change your view on certain subjects or even life itself. Experiences are not just physical activities, mental experience counts too - reading a book is similar, though not interactive, and most people consider this and that book to be an experience. Thus, I conclude that it can't be said that videogames are not experiences. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Kerbal Space Program:

- total lack of documentation of controls

- as of yet no 64-bit

- waste of educational potential; it is educational in itself, but if there was a in-game wiki friendly explaining the science and mathematics behind the orbital mechanics, it would have been enourmously advantageous - games are the most natural form of learning

- lack of some underlining story - afaik the easter eggs were planned to have been connected and to point to a faraway planet whence Kerbals come from

- I was actually kind of disappointed when I heard that the Kerbol system is actually unrealistically small. It might have been better with real-scaled planets

- lack of faster time warp - as RSS shows, it is doable, and waiting isn't much fun

- Lack of more structures on the planets and moons

I could find a lot more </TEXT>
