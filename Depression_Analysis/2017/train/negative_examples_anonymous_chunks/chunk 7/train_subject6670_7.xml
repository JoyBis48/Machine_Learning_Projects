	<TEXT> We first baked two potatoes, then cut one in half and scraped out all but 1/4" of it. We completely scraped out the other potato. The potatoes were then blended with cream cheese, butter, brown sugar, salt, pepper, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg and cayenne. This mixture was then pipetted back into the first potato skin that we cut in half and then baked for 15 mins. Turned out great! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It was actually my first time making duck! But for steak the sous vide provides an even medium rare with no overcooked exterior. The meat comes out super tender all the way through when on the skillet it sometimes comes out a little tough  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I currently work for the State of California. Although I am eligible for loan forgiveness if I keep working here for 10 years, I would have to choose an income-based repayment plan. The problem here is that with the income-based repayment plan I will have my $40,000 loan paid off in 7 years... Meaning that I never get to take advantage of the loan forgiveness at all :( </TEXT>
