	<TEXT> As a part of building my brand I'm keen to build my indentity as an authority. By creating a website with strong content, I'll get more people knowing who I am and what I do. They'll also link to my content and help my SEO.

The same goes for Social Media. A lot of my customers know me from social media interactions. I'd like the site to feed the social media and visa versa.

People find the site via a) seeing  me at gigs and in the media and b) links to content on social media c) googling my keywords.

I'm pretty good at SEO. I got my crappy old WIX site to number three on google from the seventh page in six weeks. </TEXT>

For me, I'd say my goals are:-

1) Increase overall number of visitors to my website.

2) Increase visitors requesting more information on my services as an entertainer/speaker for corporate and private functions.

3) Increase sales of my novel.

4) Reflect my personality and the personality of my performance and writing in my online presence.

5) Increase social media followers.

If someone lives nowhere near a 7/11 or a train station, they can not use public transport. 

And even if you carry a fully topped up card with you at all times, the machines STILL will often not scan properly and, unless you go to extraordinary measures, you have no way to prove it.

	<TEXT> I'd have no problem with ticket inspectors handing out fines to fare evaders if they still had a system that made it, you know, possible to buy a fare.

I live near a large hotel, on a train line, that is three kilometres from the nearest 7/11. At least once a week, without fail, I see tourists standing at the tram stop looking worried. 

I'll often ask if they are OK and they ask where they can buy a ticket. I sigh and being to explain....

It's great for my mental health but shocking for weight. I crave sugar all the time and my metaloblism has slowed right down. 

I put on 2 kilos in a fortnight (about five pounds) and so I started dieting but I just can't shift the weight. I also have a one year old daughter I look after most of the time which makes exercise hard (but not impossible)

Any hints or tips? </TEXT>

You get one chance to release a film, maybe two if the producers completely ruin the original work ala The Wicker Man.

A film's plot should be solid and inevitable, and this endless fiddling and re-releasing does nothing but water down what came before.

That means a horse has 1 in 240 chance of being killed during a race.

These doesn't include all the other terrible ways a horse can die in this industry.

They're just living their lives doing what makes them happy, hurting no one. Who am I to tell them they can't explore all of life's opportunities and wonders just because some stranger thinks they're trying too hard or that they are too pretentious.

All that said, put some fucking shoes on.
