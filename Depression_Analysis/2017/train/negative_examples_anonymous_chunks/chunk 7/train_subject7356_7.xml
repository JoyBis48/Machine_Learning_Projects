	<TEXT> Thankyou so much, that means a lot. I just need to stop feeling sorry for myself and feeling like I've pulled the short straw when I see other people in happy relationships going on holidays (which we had plans for and have had to ignore) and days out. I would be more miserable without him though, he's my bestfriend.
I'm going to try and ride the storm and be supportive and just be there until I I can't do it anymore and hopefully it'll get better.
Thanks again for your help and your words. </TEXT>
