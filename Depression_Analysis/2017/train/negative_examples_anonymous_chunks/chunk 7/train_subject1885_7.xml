	<TEXT> The hardest I've cried since I was a child was two weeks ago when I learned my best friend, the first person I met in college, took his own life. He went back to his hometown one night to go to a dentist appointment the next morning and never came back. When I texted him the next day his brother called me and said he saw I texted Anthony's phone and that I deserved to know what happened. Turns out his mom came home that morning to find him crying in the shed with a gun in his mouth. After she tried to pull the gun away, he put the gun in his mouth and pulled the trigger. I don't even want to be at this college anymore, the only person I spent time with is gone. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey Michael! 

I've read that many of the scenes from Dexter had little improvisations you put into them, were there any memorable instances where the directors told you you went too far with yourself and crossed the line between Dexter and you? 

Also are John Lithgow's eyes less creepy in person? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> During high school I took them every night for a couple of years to counter the ADHD meds I was on. They work because they make you want to be tired, they feel like natural sleep is on its way if you lay down and relax. When I got to uni I stopped taking adderall except for special occasions so I stopped taking melatonin every night, and I can still sleep and I can nap like a fuckin' champ too. No insomnia my friend. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> The super powers exist, switching to hard mode </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-11-02 16:10:47 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I've been on easy mode for a about 2 months now, and I'm going to have to switch to hard mode. The super powers are real, and I've known for a few years but I seem to forget until after going over a week without an orgasm. I don't know about you guys, but I've known about the super powers for about 4 years now, ever since I saw one picture that said not orgasming for a week can double your testosterone levels. It's as if reading that picture made that a real fact. I've tried telling people about how horrible and weak I feel the days after fapping, and they've told me they fap with no such feelings. So whether this feeling we get after fapping is real or just made in our heads, one thing is for sure. The super powers are more than real. Orgasming in general has begun to make me feel weak, and casual sex with girls I'm not into is beginning to lose its thrill because I know how weak it'll make me feel. I'd rather go a week without an orgasm and lose my social anxiety altogether rather than have one night flings every week. Right now, right now is the first time I've hit the week mark without an orgasm, even if I haven't fapped in 2 months. And this is the first time I've felt the powers of testosterone. I hope this helps you fapstronauts who aren't feeling the super powers yet but haven't switched to hard mode, it's worth it. </TEXT>
