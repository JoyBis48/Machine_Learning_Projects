	<TEXT> Makes sense to me. Sniper weapons don't ink as much. I don't think they are good for Turf War format. Honestly, anytime I have a teammate with one I just disconnect. I played for a long time and it's just horrible They go like 2-12 with 2-400Pts. Very little ink. They just sit in one spot and try and snipe people. Even if they move around inking they don't ink a lot. 

So like I said, I understand your opinion. That's cool. I got no problem with differing opinions. I just disagree.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For me I have a few things. 

1. Being able to change weapons while you wait for the game to start instead of going to the lobby. 

2. I get annoyed at teammates that use the sniper guns for Turf Wars, they don't splat a lot of ground which is evident by their points, and they don't even get a lot of kills to make up for it. It's a good gun but not for that game type I don't think. 

3. Not having Turf Wars be on ranked as well. 

4. Being forced to play splatzone or tower control instead of being able to have the choice to play one. I don't want to have to wait 4 hours to play tower control. 

5. More maps in rotation than just 2. 

6. Teammates that super jump to your area when you're in the middle of mayhem and they die instantly by the enemy just pointing their gun at the circle where they're jumping.

	<DATE> 2015-07-06 22:44:09 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So my friend and I were on Skype and decided to play some Splatoon. Now whenever we do 'friends' we are only on the same team maybe 10% of the time- dunno why. So today we were against each other 19/24 games (I kept track). We were at the Saltrig so we went to one particular spot stopped and saw each other and just splatted in front of each other the entire game hahaha. 

It was so much fun. We gave away our teammates locations to each other if they were jumping in. If my teammates jumped in I would run block if they tried to kill him and he did vice versa. 

It was a nice change up and a fun way to do something different. I'm pretty sure the 6 people playing with us hated us, but I don't think they ever figured it out. We get about 1800 each just splatting in front of each other over and over.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi. Thank you for your response. As a user and a mod of a very small subreddit I want to say thank you for your candor and apology.  

I have a question for you. I am not trying to be mean or insulting or anything; however, can you please step down from Reddit? The majority of us do not want you running Reddit. Can you please step down? This is something that would be considered a great action on your part. This is a way to back up your promises. This is a good solution I think. I know you mean well, but you're just not working out well for us. You've had many chances to correct things and you have not. As a result can you please leave? 

The way your team handled this situation with mods and the firing of Victoria and everything the past year or so, is reason enough for you to step down. What has been done on here by your team cannot be made up with a simple 'text' based apology.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well what I'm saying is, Victoria did a great job at what she did, why not find someone with those same qualities and things she did so good at- and have that be the job requirement? /r/IAMA mods specifically stated how well she worked with them and how pleased they were with what she did. So...why can't we get someone else exactly like that  </TEXT>

Also, does Pao plan to respond to the petition for her to be fired reaching 150K people? This is a reasonably large deal, it's not like it's just a few people that 'hate' her anymore.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Maybe. There's no real way to know that for sure. He has a shot in the democratic primary. It will either be Hillary or him. 

Look, in 2008, I worked on Obama's primary team and no one thought we had a shot over the Clinton machine either....but we won. You can win an election with a very good ground game. 

A lot of people assume that candidates win- with how they make sense of what issues people find important. The truth is, in the ground game for campaigns, rarely do you ever talk about issues. It's all about numbers. They say you gain a vote every 3 houses you talk to people. So we knocked on insane amounts of houses. To do that, obviously you have to have a substantial amount of dedicated volunteers and also you need to have a good program to use to print up all of the people who voted which way and what way in the previous primaries and a good software system to input all of the data. 

When we won the primary and I worked on the 2008 general election one thing I noticed versus John McCain was he had less volunteers on the ground and they wasted time when they went door to door. (this is just in the area I worked in Ohio). They would argue with someone to vote for McCain at their house for a good 20 minutes. If someone tells you "I'm voting for the opponent no matter what" You don't spend 20 minutes trying to convince him you move on. In those twenty minutes, you can hit 5-6 more houses. It's just a waste of a time to argue. Rarely did I ever speak about the issues with people because I didn't want to waste time- only if I thought was it worth it and I always explained why I was voting for him and for people to make up their own mind. In addition, in my area the McCain volunteers were at odds with the Republican Party volunteers (for local elections- republican party wanted to take many mccain volunteers and use them for local campaigns...) Also, they didn't work on Sundays where I was at. Which is fine- I get the reasoning behind that but while they weren't working we worked 24-7. 

Sanders has a good following if he can turn that into thousands of volunteers working for him- he has a shot. Primaries are state by state- it's certainly doable. If he picks up momentum watch out

Republicans have a good shot to win 2016 as well- if they pick a solid candidate. Romney wasn't good and while McCain was a solid candidate his VP hurt him. I think- it would help them if they changed their platform on marriage equality. that likely wont happen though </TEXT>
