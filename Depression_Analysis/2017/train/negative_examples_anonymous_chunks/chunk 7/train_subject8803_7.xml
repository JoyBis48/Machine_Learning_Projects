	<TEXT> The red light district in Amsterdam. 

It is suchs a sad place to walk around. All these girls behind the windows selling their body's and clearly not wanting to be there. All these fucked up lives.. The place just screams sadness. I always get really uncomfortable when I have to be in that area. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Completely agreed. It is also really wierd that to call a team that represents their city and not their country World Champions. You also dont call the winner of the champions league (football/soccer in EU) World Champions, you call the winner of the world championship world champions. And only teams that represent a country can participate. </TEXT>
