	<TEXT> I mentioned below, but I think a taser would be ideal in this situation.  Once he got so close I'm sure the officers adrenaline rose and he literally has to make his one second decision now before either him or his fellow officer get hurt.  

They do not know if the guy has a gun and if he had a gun would you want to be holding a taser? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> After reading everyone's replies I feel as if you don't really need reddit's advice.  
Sounds like you have the mindset to dump school n start working full time, so your husband doesn't have to lose time with his kids.  
  I hope he finds work soon in his field, otherwise he should look into another job or work nights.  Ya it sucks and it messes up your sleep schedule.  Gotta do what ya gotta do!  

Sell that Chevy truck and fix that Saturn up to code.  

$150 is pretty high cell bill especially since only one of you need a "smart phone".  I'd say dump the contact and get the hubby a minute trac phone.   

You need legal advice for non child support payments from your ex.   He is homeless?   Also look into lowering thr garnishing wages on your husband child support.  

I'm really sorry for your situation and with strength and motivation you will get out of it.   You guys need to make the sacrifices now otherwise you'll be stuck forever.  

Hoping there will be a hand out from someone to get you out of this rut will probably not happen.  

Time to stand up for the kids!   Are you delivering papers for $500/month?   </TEXT>

My father bought me a Bmx that was pretty costly for my rents income.  


Anyway bike was stolen n my dad went to all the pawn shops with the bikes serial number.    He was told if it showed up we would be notified.   

My bike showed up and ended up being sold to someone I know.    Whose family was a lot less fortunate than us.  
My dad let the kid keep the bike and he cried tears of joy because of that.

	<TEXT> So true.   My friend was in a pretty popular punk band and they were on there last tour.  During their concert I was getting drinks for them and walking them back stage as they performed.  The security guy out of no where grabs me on my 3rd pass and tells me I can no longer walk anywhere.  Even when the show was done I could not stay with the band.   Even some of the members would be playing and walk over to the security guy and I next to the stage and ask what the hell was going on.   

I never really hold grudges, but the ego tripping security guard in MN was a complete d-bag.   
If you are that d-bag security guard and you somehow stumble across  this.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I have a 2006 Acura TL where the power windows, reverse lights, blinkers,sunroof, gauge cluster and lights are not working.  

I checked all fuses (meter) and relays and everything looks and test fine.  I cannot roll the windows down with the switch inside the car, but if I do the key in the door I can get all windows/sunroof to roll up and down.  

The blinkers do not work but the hazard button still does.  

Any ideas? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My first trampoline was inherited from my mom when she was a child.  It was rectangle and I think it had a total of 7 springs.   Every year one spring would rip right through the material.   Even had a hole in middle from cigar burn back in the 80's.   

When you jump you would basically touch the ground and the flimsy trampoline would fight to make you bounce.   

I miss that thing </TEXT>

I also have some original
Drawings and prints.    
Some of the movies include.

	<TEXT> Similar story, when I was a wee lad I received one of those earth day baby pine trees.   I planted it right away in my parents from lawn right by this rock, so it wouldn't get mowed over.    

Flash forward  12 years, it was 2008 and my parents house was foreclosed on.   It all happened so fast, but we ended moving 20+years of stuff to a rental.    

One thing I did leave was that tree I planted.    It was a little bigger than myself.   

Time goes by and new ppl have moved into our home and I just try and forget about the whole situation.   Until one day I was going to show my new gf the house.    I told her all about that tree and what it meant to me and I was excited to see hoe much it grew.     Well, the new homeowners cut the bastard down.  

Was a sad day that my tree had to leave.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's true.   I don't play soccer, but would play catch with friends.   Anyway one summer day my younger sister was tormenting me while playing soccer with a friend.    

She would run up and throw water or whatever she could find at us and run back up our grassy hill to the pavement steps before entering the wooden door.  

Finally I was fed up after she just soaked me from a glass of water.    On her retreat just as she was making her way to the peak of the grassy hill, I kicked the ball towards the house.     The ball was in flight until it hit the side of the hill and started speed rolling right towards her feet.    She took 1 step before that ball went between her legs, and on her opposite leg swing her ankles hugged the ball and her knees buckled.  Slamming her to concrete from a full sprint as the water glass hit the wooden door.  

It was awesome  </TEXT>
