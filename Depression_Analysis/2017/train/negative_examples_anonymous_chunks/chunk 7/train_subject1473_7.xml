	<TEXT> For some reason I didn't think his response was "pretty much explaining it" and thought the question made sense. When I think "unpopular opinion" I think of an opinion that most people may not agree with but can understand why somebody may think that way (e.g. Communism works). When I think "fringe opinion" I think of an opinion that would make most people respond with something along the lines of "are you fucking serious?" (e.g. President Obama is actually a space alien). I was trying to ask where to draw the line between something that is not widely agreed with and something that is considered ridiculious.

Edit: I think I just answered my own question. If an opinion would make the overwhelming majority of people say you were nuts or doesn't make sense, or is extreme it is "lunatic fringe", but if a good number of sane people would agree with it and make positive arguments in favor, but not the majority, it is simply unpopular/fringe. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I understand that I might the flamed because you may assume that since this post is about Justin Bieber it must be a troll, but that is not the case. If you look at the recklessness, idiocy, and entitlement that Bieber has exhibited and the paths that many has been celebrities go down, I wouldn't be surprised. On top of that it is relatively rare for a teen idol pop star to have fame that lasts for decades to come. 

Think about MC Hammer, another pop star who became rich and famous while still young and went into multi million dollar debt after splurging on mansions, cars, and other luxuries a few years after his peak, or Lenny Dykstra, the arrogant Major League Baseball player who formed a series of unsuccessful businesses after his retirement and resorted to credit card fraud, car theft, and stealing his seized possessions after going bankrupt. Has been celebrities, expensive lifestyles, and entitlement are not a good combination. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Their White population has been in decline for years, but I guess "nonexistent by 2050" is probably too much of an exaggeration. According to [this article]( http://www.iol.co.za/news/south-africa/number-of-whites-in-steady-decline-1.1223994#.VWuSoP3JDcs), it is predicted to be 20% lower than in 2010 by 2040. However, unless there is a big economic boom and South Africa becomes developed like a European country, I don't see how the number of Whites over there can do anything other than decline. </TEXT>
