	<TEXT> Storytime. Some douche in an admittedly awesome supercharged mustang was driving around Chicago revving his engine and cutting people off and stuff so our cab driver in his Sorrento revved his engine at the stop light and then when it turned green floored it into the parking lane and overtook the mustang. The mustang guy was so pissed he parked outside the bar we were at and waited for at least 20 minutes. It was awesome. </TEXT>
