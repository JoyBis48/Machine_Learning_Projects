https://www.vox.com/2015/4/30/8518681/protests-riots-work

Violent protests, including riots, and then full blown revolutions, are just part of a scale - the scale of "how much you're inconveniencing the government" with the "protest".

It's the *government* that should be listening to peaceful protests - such as let's say Occupy Wallstreet - but they don't, and then leave people no choice, but to "escalate" the protests. And when violence and window breaking starts, it appears to be "sudden", when in fact it's just the people letting out their old frustrations that are bubbling up. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Or it could be a Mexican drug cartel using Chinese botnets. How do they really know? My guess is that if it *was* a Mexican cartel trying to get info on US government employees that they can blackmail, then the NSA wouldn't say it's them anyway, and would probably still blame it on China. There's nothing to gain for the NSA from saying it's a Mexican cartel that did it. What would they do about that (politically) - start *another* war on drugs?

Either way, it seems the US government is taking absolutely *zero* responsibility for the hack "well, because China...and they have good hackers" - or something.

It would be even worse if say Nigeria or hackers from Moldova got all that info. Because that would make *them* look like the main people to blame for it, as they would look completely incompetent.

Also, Recorded Future and I'm sure other security companies as well, have found that this info is [all over the web](https://www.recordedfuture.com/government-credentials-report/) already. So it really doesn't matter if "China has it" anymore. *Everyone has it* (interested enough to pay for it). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Usually it takes about 10 years (8% density improvement year over year) to *double* the capacity for the same price (and size).

I really think we're going to see *at least* a quadrupling in density for batteries over the next 10 years. The first doubling is going to come by default as mentioned. The second doubling will come through a combination of Tesla's Gigafactories significantly lowering the price of batteries (so you can add bigger density for the same fixed price) and new "breakthroughs" such as this new manufacturing process, or by switching to solid state batteries, or whatever else will become reality in the next 10 years.

A quadrupling in density would mean even $15,000-$20,000 cars with 300+ mile ranges will become a reality over the next decade. Even if on paper you'd get a $20,000 EV that has the same specifications as a $15,000 gas-powered car (so $5,000 more expensive for the same specs, because of the battery cost), you'd still be better off in the long term because of much less maintenance, much cheaper charging and so on. So even if people intended to buy a $15,000 car, they would still try to buy a $20,000 EV because they'll know it will cost them much less in the long term.

When 300 mile batteries will be only $5,000 of the price of a car, EVs will start replacing cars *at all price levels*. </TEXT>

However, there's also the issue of needing a more powerful GPU. New Adreno GPUs are only like 30% more powerful than last year's high-end generation. Same goes for other GPUs more or less. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I thought it's at least a little relevant here, because I know there have been some discussions in the past about whether to enable encryption on Android by default or not. Although I think most here would do it *as long as there's hardware assistance* to make the performance impact negligible. 

Hopefully with Android M and beyond all OEMs will enable encryption by default, as they should all have hardware that support it by then, even at the low-end (Cortex-A53 chips).

Besides the given reasons in the post, there's also that whole other issue of scrambling your data so that when you sell your phone, you don't let others recover your pictures, or Google accounts and so on. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> But that would ruin the "nation-state villain" profile the US government is trying to put in Americans' minds when it comes to hacking.

It's much easier to pass new surveillance laws when "China is attacking us! We NEED THIS!" than "China, but also Russia, and Bulgaria, and South Africa, etc are hacking us...but also tons of random hackers and criminal organizations....and also that's mainly our fault for thinking encryption is literally Hitler so we shouldn't touch it with a 10-foot pole and for securing our stuff so poorly because we invest 90% of our "defense" budgets on *offense*...oh, and we're hacking others much more than they do us, too, and we want to give the same powers to the FBI and the US police to hack anyone in the world as well."

I mean that already paints a much more complex and confusing picture about hacking and would make passing laws to give themselves more powers and strip away more of the Americans' rights much more difficult.

So "China is hacking us!" it is. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree for the same reasons. It's so much easier to "make it" in the US, because the market is almost completely homogeneous, making it "easy" to sell products for millions of dollars, and for the same reason to get investments of millions of dollars in your startup. It's a zillion times harder to do the same "in Europe", because Europe is so fragmented, and English not being an official (at least second) language hinders things as well. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So? That doesn't explain why the subsidies weren't cut let's say 10 or 20 years later. Subsidies should only be used in the early years of a new technology or industry to give that industry a "boost". Otherwise you could also make the argument that renewable energy should get subsidies for 100 years as well, until we're all using 100% renewable energy (which seems to be the rather weak goal of the G7 countries right now).

Yet, in countries like Germany subsidies for renewables were already cut after about 5 years only, and in the US they are about to go down from 30% to 10% in a year and I think completely gone by 2020.

The problem with leaving subsidies for much longer than 10 years or so is that the industry gets accustomed to that money from the government and doesn't invest in increasing efficiency as much as it should when they are forced by the market to drop prices below a certain price level. Or they simply pocket that difference in profit. 

The oil companies are some of the richest companies on Earth and have been for their entire lifetimes, yet somehow we *still* need to subsidize them - why?! Do you really thin that if their subsidies were cut, they *wouldn't* bring down their prices and cut into their own profits? Of course they would. Because if they keep prices at say $6 per gallon instead of $4, then many more people would be interested in buying an electric car. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Seriously, probably the best way to drastically increase the security of its systems is for the US government to switch to its own distro of Linux.

And no, I don't just say that because "Linux is more secure than Windows" or whatever, but because the fact that 90% of the world's computers run on the same OS means a TON of people are invested in exploiting it, which means it's not just a top priority for *many* governments to hack it (not just China or Russia, who would focus on breaking the US gov's Linux distro anyway, but others with lower budgets as well) and it's also much easier for them to buy exploits from the black market.

If the US gov alone used say a distro called "Gov-X", it would also be much easier to track those who try to exploit it and hack it. The same thing is futile with Windows hackers, as there are always thousands more waiting in the shadows. </TEXT>

Also, if Uber "wins" we're going to have one mega-corporation owning 50-60% or more not just of a country's "taxis", but of *all* of the world's taxis. That is the opposite of decentralization. Do we really want one company to be the "Google" or Windows of taxis? (in terms of market share). </TEXT>

Who said you're coming up trillions short in revenue? Are you referring to that article/top comment on r/politics from a few days ago?

That article and top comment were only referring to the 14.5% tax on income and touting how then the government would come up short on revenue. But as this article here says, the 14.5% VAT tax would bring twice as much revenue as the 14.5% income tax. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If only they focused on actually mandating strong security and encryption in government agencies instead of trying to pass more surveillance laws.

The NSA is promoting the lie that it can "protect the networks" by acting as an anti-virus. From recent Snowden docs we learned that the NSA was already illegally doing that, yet it didn't stop the OPM hack, and it couldn't have. Security tools like anti-viruses and even firewalls don't work as well anymore. 

What they need to recommend is strong *end-device* security, not strong network security. So when a hacker tries to breach a network, with strong end-device security, he would have to basically hack every single device, rather than the network gateway and then easily get access to thousands of PCs. Google is doing the [same thing](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en/us/pubs/archive/43231.pdf)(pdf) with its networks now, and it's what everyone should be doing. 

But of course the NSA doesn't want strong end-device security, because that would mean stuff being harder for them to steal as well. So the US government needs to decide once and for all if spying is more important, even if it means getting all of its data stolen as well, or actual security and protecting everyone. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The US gov just lost sensitive data for intelligence personnel in a hack and now they're trying to put the blame on Snowden's 2+ year old documents, but they are getting the UK government to do the propaganda for them on this. If you may have noticed the US and UK governments have quite coordinated public campaigns when it comes to stuff like this.
