	<TEXT> I agree with your diagnosis of the problem, but when you make a post like this, can you please spend at least as much time proposing solution as you do illustrating the problem?  I realize this is a big departure from the the current culture of this subreddit, but without solutions and proposed actions there is absolutely no point to even illustrating the problem.  In fact, psychologically, we were better off before we knew, or when we weren't thinking about it.

I'll start: How can we stop war?  We can make war-mongering politically unfeasible by recalling/no longer electing anyone who supports war.  We can stop paying the portion of our taxes that goes to fund wars.  We can protest.  We can engage in anti-recruitment to ensure there aren't enough soldiers to engage in war. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I never said that.  It sometimes is. I also don't think it's universally a negative force in the world.  At it's worst it is brainwashing and violence-inducing.  At it's best, it brings people together with a knowledge that they can work together to improve the world.

Look, I'm not really a fan of organized religion.  I prefer a more fluid and personal path to spirituality.  I just don't think we should throw the baby out with the bathwater. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The first statement, I absolutely agree with.  Religion does not have a monopoly on morality.

#2, depends on how you parse it.  For instance, would something like the Spanish Inquisition happen without religion? Not exactly like that, no.  But people can still be zealots without being religious.  Political zealots can engage is mass murder and persecution as well, like stalinists or anti-communists for example.

It's really not possible to distill all the world's problems down to a single thing.  Or if it is, it's something more fundamental than religion, maybe like ego, or fear. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If people don't have religious beliefs, you're right, it's impossible to manipulate them on the basis of THOSE beliefs.  But my point is that religious beliefs are not the only way that capitalists manipulate people (particularly into war.)  They also use economic imperatives, non-religious ideology, and and just plain scaremongering.  I'll give you an example of each.

Economic imperative: "We need to go in and open up those trade routes!" or "Fight this war and you get money for college."

Non-religious ideology: "We've got to stop those commies or they'll destroy freedom everywhere!"

Fear: "Saddam Hussein. WMDs. 911. Saddam Hussein. WMDs. 911. Saddam Hussein. WMDs. 911." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I managed to fix my problem.  I had to recreate my Live USB and then I reinstalled.  I did two things wrong on my first attempt to install.  I didn't make a separate /home partition (I'm not sure if this is actually necessary but folks on the irc channel said I should.)  I think the main problem was that I selected sda1 as the boot disc instead of just sda.  After I reinstalled it booted directly into Mint.  After running "sudo os-prober" and "sudo update-grub" it now gives me GRUB on boot with both Mint and Windows present. Hurray! </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Need help fixing GRUB after un/reinstalling Linux Mint on dual boot system </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-08-29 00:55:38 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> This is long, but I'm trying to give all the necessarily details to get help.  Currently I can't boot either Windows or Linux.

I had a system with Windows 8 on one partition and Linux Mint on another and GRUB booting.  At some point Linux Mint became corrupt and I decided to wipe the partition and reinstall it. I chose to install Linux Mint KDE 64 bit edition.

So I created a Live USB and boot from that and did a manual disk partition.  I deleted the partition with Linux and created two new partitions in that space.  The first 3GB as a swap partition.  The remaining space became the a partition of type ext4 and mount point "/".  I think it's device id was /dev/sda5.  I selected sda1 to be the boot partition because I think this is where GRUB was location previously (it had a size of 500MB). sda2 is the Windows partition.  The installation went ahead and now when I boot I get this:

 Grub Loading. Welcome to Grub!
error: no such partition.
Entering rescue mode...
grub rescue

My first thought was to try to repair GRUB from linux so I put the bootable usb back and.  But now when i try to boot from the usb it gives this:

 MDM could not write a new authorization entry to disk. Possibly out of diskspace.   Error: no space left no device.

I press OK and it says:

 Could not start the X server (your graphical environment) due to some internal error...

It then goes to a black screen.  Next I will try making another bootable USB on my other computer since it apparently got messed up somehow.

I also tried messing around in the grub rescue prompt but I don't really know what I'm doing there.  How should I proceed? Any help will be greatly appreciated. Thanks! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Here's the thing. You said a "jackdaw is a crow."
Is it in the same family? Yes. No one's arguing that.
As someone who is a scientist who studies crows, I am telling you, specifically, in science, no one calls jackdaws crows. If you want to be "specific" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing.
If you're saying "crow family" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of Corvidae, which includes things from nutcrackers to blue jays to ravens.
So your reasoning for calling a jackdaw a crow is because random people "call the black ones crows?" Let's get grackles and blackbirds in there, then, too.
Also, calling someone a human or an ape? It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works. They're both. A jackdaw is a jackdaw and a member of the crow family. But that's not what you said. You said a jackdaw is a crow, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the crow family crows, which means you'd call blue jays, ravens, and other birds crows, too. Which you said you don't.
It's okay to just admit you're wrong, you know? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's interesting.  I didn't consider the object bumping into air molecules in front of it and that it would bump into less with the wind blowing in the same direction.

Is there a formula for how much force is applied to the object by the wind based on the object's current velocity, mass, and the wind speed? </TEXT>

Neither is feminists and egalitarian! Double standard much?  

 Yeah it does and I'll tell you why. Tell a feminist you're pro-male and they will assume you're anti-female and a woman hater/beater/rapist.

Do you not see the irony in this?  You are assuming that anyone is who feminist is anti-male.  I just can't even.. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Firstly, I'm glad you experience the magic of the universe. 

 How would my world be any more magical if I believed a talking bush told me to commit war crimes?

This is a total strawman.

 But I think what really sets us apart is the red pill/blue pill question: could it be that you prefer to hold wrong beliefs that are comforting rather than true beliefs that are not.

What really sets us apart is that you believe in an objective reality and I believe it is more subjective.  That ultimately comes down to a philosophical debate, because it is impossible to prove the nature of the universe to be either way.  But take a look at special relativity for an example of how reality might be different for different observers. </TEXT>
