	<TEXT> The great thing about it going to Netflix was how much creative freedom was given to the show itself. Normally, we'd assume it'd be a complete risk to take a show to a streaming company, but Kevin Spacey and David Fincher didn't even hesitate. 

I really hope Netflix grabs more projects like this.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Nah, I just put that there as a draft. The logo's meant to be standalone when it all comes down to it. As for the monochrome, that's the big thing I'm trying to solve right now. 

Edit: by standalone, i mean that I'll have 'Art   Politik' written and placed differently to complement how the logo is sized and placed itself. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hah, I wouldn't say it was awful! It definitely needed work on keeping consistent with how emotionally ignited the opening scenes were, but the script still managed to keep people seated with what it offered.  But damn, they really should have utilized Cranston and Watanbe more.

Thanks for the feedback! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm with you on that. As much as I'll criticize that movie, The Lost World is an irreversible staple in my childhood. I just watched it again a few weeks ago after finishing the book, and I still love it. 

The movie's got its glaring flaws, but it doesn't mean we can't enjoy it for what it is. That scene with Julian Moore was pure classic Spielberg. From all the summer movies that come out these days, I found myself appreciating scenes like that a lot more. </TEXT>

For the record, I didn't mean for it to come across like that. I've kept that car since then, and I love it. I don't consider it a hardship in the slightest bit. Learning stick-shift was one of the best things I've ever done.

Thank you, by the way! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I completely agree with you. I hope I didn't come off as otherwise. I didn't mean to say that photographers shouldn't act like that because it endangers rights; I was only writing about how it does.

When I was writing it, I used the paparazzi as more of an example to remind us that we need to watch how we act when we shoot in public. It was to show that we need to remember to be respectful because doing otherwise just makes us look bad and hypocritical. I pointed out the danger it has to rights to show a secondary consequence of it as well; that's why I had the title include that the activities of paparazzi are dangerous for 'photographers *and* their rights'.
