Keep your distance but not too far away or he'll do his frenzy attacks, just close enough and he'll do that one swipe which you can avoid easily.

At the end he goes crazy and I get tagged a few times before I get back into the rhythm of the attacks. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When you get more than 20 of the health items or bullets they go into storage.

So If you run out and die, rather than farming go back to the hunters dream and restock.

If you run out of both... Then yeah, you have to farm or purchase them. That's a simple gameplay mechanic present in most if not all games. Or do you expect games to just hand you what you need so you dont need to actually play the game? </TEXT>

Best one was the dude who voiced Goku, got him to yell it out like he was powering up a kamehameha, then again as King Kai.

Though not once have I have I recorded them saying it... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm aware and fine with that, when the game is released. 

Not in alpha, especially after already paying an access fee to test their game.

	<TEXT> Wait.. isnt the final game going to be free?


Why are people paying to play an alpha / to be a tester... as well as pay a monthly sub fee to do so.

Remember the days when companies paid people to test their games, when games came out as final products and DLC / expansions where an after thought and not part of the games build / business strategy...

I recommend you xpost these to /r/estoration and /r/colorizationrequests, you'll be able to get a few of these fixed up.

	<TEXT> PlayStation Gold Wireless Stereo Headset

You can pick them, up for about $99 these days, if not cheaper.

They're confortable, the sound quality is decent, battery lasts a few days on one charge, they support different sound profiles / uses the PS4 app to change equalizer settings, and well... they're wireless which is always a plus. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No they are not, I have lost two accounts so far.

The first one I had since PSN first launched, I spent months fighting with Sony to recover it after it was hacked... I had over $2000 worth of digital content on that account, games for PS3, PSP, Vita, and PS4... Sony said they could not verify any of my information. I guess as it had been changed, the name, address and email had been changed more than 3 times... Apparently their system doesnt keep record of the original information if it is changed enough times. So too them I never owned the account, all the receipts of purchases were useless, all the information I could provide was moot, there was no way I could prove it was my account.

The second time it happened, within the same year I might add... I didnt even bother trying to recover it.

I have since cut back majorly on using PSN to purchase digital content, and if it werent for all my firends being Sony/PS4 users I would have switched over to XBOX or PC.

	<TEXT> He probably thought Nutella was a health food and joined a class action lawsuit after he found out it's not really all that good for you.

Meaning he is either retarded or he jumped on the bandwagon to be part of the lawsuit in hopes of getting some money.

As others have mentioned, some PS4 games will download a part of the game, the intro, sometimes a prologue section that you can watch or play while the rest of the game downloads. 

That seems to be the case here. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> "Hey guy, buy our incomplete game at full price. We'll patch in the missing content at a later date, you know, the stuff that we promised would be available at launch. The stuff we even delayed the release for... But dont worry, the game looks good, shiny like.

Feel like the base game content is a bit barebone, a bit sparse? Dont worry, we've got all this other content coming out for you... Which you can pay for, as single dlc packs or as a (*snickers quietly*) season pass.

Whats that, is this an early access title? No, it's a AAA game (*chortles audibly this time*) so dont worry, we'll have all the content and bugs fixed by the end of the games life cycle... But thanks for your $56.95 + $27.95, we may choose to provide this content for free to other users who purchase this game once it's complete.

Thank you early adopter and race on!" </TEXT>
