	<TEXT> No, actually you don't. As a point guard you can, ya know, pass. Create for others. Run an offense. I don't know. But if you're gonna throw up 15 3s and miss 13, you have to be held accountable. If you're going to air ball a go ahead jumper, you have to be ridiculed. That's how MVPs are supposed to be treated. If Lebron James can score 44 and miss a game winner by inches and get roasted for it, Curry most definitely can when he air balls it on top of a god awful night. This isn't even a conversation.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I didn't mean he didn't have any plays at all. I just meant that his motion Princeton offense that they threw out in December doesn't work with a ball dominant guy. so the sets he does draw up are to get Lebron a mismatch on the post or a shooter coming up off of down screens. nothing that involves all 5 guys in positions to score like the Warriors have. that's all I meant. Lebron definitely needs to chill on the ISOs tho </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah for real. TT had 2 points. He doesn't usually do that. He missed some bunnies that he usually makes. JR won't shoot that poorly again, Shump won't either. JJ will knock a couple down. even Delly could hit something. I'm extremely disappointed about the Kyrie situation just for Kyrie's sake bc the dude plays so damn hard, but I still think this is a very winnable series. Lebron just has to go back to that "get everybody else going first" role he's played in the past and we got these guys. Keep the faith everyone </TEXT>

	<TEXT> the JR comment is just wrong. he's been consistently hot basically since he put on a cavs uni. and the warriors walked into the finals just like the Cavs did. Just because they played teams with better records, doesnt mean they played better teams. The Pels wouldve sold their souls to just win a game in that series, the Grizz never had a real shot bc they couldnt guard steph and he was just off in the games they lost. also, bigs-focused teams are a good matchup for them. and the rockets had a 37 year old spot up shooting guard playing the point and guarding steph curry. and josh smith, JOSH SMITH, started. 

Also, Cavs defensively are better without Love in the lineup. So him being out favors the Cavs defensively. This will be a much better series than 90% of people think. 
Cavs in 7.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> hahahah youre so dumb. people who dive hands first and get arm locked arent going for the ball the right way! youre supposed to secure the ball and shield it from the opponent. delly dove on it and rolled to shield the ball from the opponent so there wouldnt be a jump ball. he made the perfect play and if korver hadnt gotten hurt, literally no one would be saying anything about it. this viewpoint is idiotic at best </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What do you mean by "age as gracefully as Curry and Durant"? Totally agree with the old man game portion tho. Those guys who are smarter, have better footwork, and have an unblockable jumper are the guys who can play for 20 years in the league and still be effective </TEXT>

	<TEXT> People act like no coach has ever done something unorthodox before. Spoelstra did the same thing a couple years ago. Literally took the team bowling and they went on a hot streak. Shane Battier started his "Battioke" Karaoke night and it was always in like March so they got a night off and got a break and came back with a hot streak. This stuff happens all the time. You just dont see it reported about because Lebron isnt on every team and every coach isnt coaching Lebron, putting his every action into the spotlight. These kinds of moves and very strategically done and typically end with a positive result.    </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I honestly don't like Kyrie on the floor at all guarding their starting group. I guess him guarding Barnes is the best option, but Kerr is smart. He'll just post up Barnes and work Kyrie 5 possessions in a row until we do something about it. Hopefully Ky can hold his own for 8-10 minutes before the Delly sub can come in and rotate everybody back in place.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hospital was supposed to blow when the Joker hit the trigger the first time when he was walking away from it in The Dark Knight. It legitimately malfunctioned and he stayed in character and improved the whole scene from then on out. It turned out way better than the original would have in my opinion too. Showed how great Heath did with that role. Also, there was a camera rigged in the bus (not sure if they thought of using that footage or not) but he stayed in character the entire ride. Thought that all was pretty awesome </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Bruh. Draymond too small. Lebron said it himself. And Iggy? Dude can't handle him in the post, which is where he'll be 60% of the time. Barnes will get out smarted on the post and if you guys are dumb enough to double, Kyrie, Iman, Delly, JJ, and JR are gonna give you the pipe and splash back side 3's. Get outta here with this nonsense.  </TEXT>
