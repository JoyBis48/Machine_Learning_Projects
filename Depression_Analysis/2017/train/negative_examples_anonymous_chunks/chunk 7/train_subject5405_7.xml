Russias Vladimir Putin accuses United States of meddling over Fifa arrests


Vladimir Putin has accused the United States of meddling outside its jurisdiction by arresting officials from Fifa.

This is yet another blatant attempt [by the United States] to extend its jurisdiction to other states, the Russian president said on Thursday.

Putin added that the arrests were a clear attempt to prevent the re-election of Fifa head Sepp Blatter and that the Swiss had Russias backing.

It looks very strange, the arrests are carried out on the request of the USA side, he said.

They are accused of corruption  who is? International officials. I suppose that someone broke some rules, I dont know. But definitely, its got nothing to do with the USA. Those officials are not US citizens. If something happened it was not in the US and its nothing to do with them. </TEXT>

The prosecutions are being brought under RICO, the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act of 1970, which was designed to prosecute crime syndicates that had taken over otherwise lawful organizations. Roughly speaking, the law works by allowing the government to prove that a defendant participated in a criminal organization and also committed at least two criminal acts under other specified laws, including bribery and wire fraud. If the government can prove that, the defendant is guilty of racketeering, and qualifies for stiff sentences, the seizure of assets and potential civil-liability lawsuits. </TEXT>

North Korea may be cut off from much of the world, but the so-called Hermit Kingdom manages to run a thriving multimillion-dollar business building monuments, statues, museums, sports stadiums, and more for a long list of countries, many of them in Africa. Its most recent deal fetched $5 million for two statues of Robert Mugabe, Zimbabwes longtime president, to mark the leaders 90th birthday. </TEXT>
