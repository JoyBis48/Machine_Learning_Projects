You donct speak a language if you have survival skills enough to ask how are you and the my name is stuff. You can't speak in a language at that rate, but you only know the basics of it. 

Memorizing a dialog or two off of a pimsleur tape isn't a giant feat worthy of ted talks. I don't get the hype. 


In some ways this dabbling hyperglottism is less impressive than someone actually learning one or two languages to a high level.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Even a lot of the formerly good second tier cities are appreciating too much to make them a good value. Chattanooga used to be awesome price wise but now the downtown has risen in price dramatically. The rust belt is still a good choice if you are in certain industries where you can have the best of both worlds.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Do what you have to do to survive. How many beds/baths is your place?  

I plan on either buying one of the few "entry" level homes for 130k and living in one bedroom while I rent the other. 

I am realizing more and more that people in general have to roll with the economic times and hustle to get by, and I am totally willing to do that. 
If you and your wife life in a relatively large home/condo, getting a roomie may be a wise move. Even in a year or two you will have saved a bunch of cash without more hours at work.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Exactly. Even if you get one and it appreciates, unless you get a bunch of roomies and charge through the nose in rent, the taxes/HOA will eat you alive. Unless you sell, in which case you no longer have somewhere to live. 

But you might make a handsome profit.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> And consider that they may never be able to buy into the market like boomers did. People in nyc/sf/portland where the prices may grow 3/4 percent yearly mean that their income, even high ranking nationally, may not keep pace with prices.  A lot of people in these cities bought decades ago when homes were relatively inexpensive in comparison to income.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It is like any big industry. Buy up all the market and make the rules so nobody can enter the market and raise barriers to entry. 

Blackrock did the same on a national scale, buying up massses of rental properties. 


Zoning is what makes people have to buy and rent subpar units. Otherwise there would be more stock available.  </TEXT>
