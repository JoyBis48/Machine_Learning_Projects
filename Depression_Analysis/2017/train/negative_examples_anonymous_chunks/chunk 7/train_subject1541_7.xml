	<TEXT> Is there any way to change rim models on a car? I'm currently working on a Rauh Welt skin for the Yellowbird, and it just does not look right with the base rims. If I made a model for a new rim, is there any way that I can swap it out? More specifically, it really needs 3 piece rims. </TEXT>
