	<TEXT> I get up every morning at an early hour.  After a shower, feeding the pets, and making a pot of coffee to leave by my wife's bedside table I head out to my local Starbucks where I read the New York Times and hang out with my pal aka, the Dude.  The two of us have become such an institution at this SBUX that we've made tons of sober friends, SBUX regulars, and even networked various business deals including recently introducing an orthopedic surgeon to his new medical practice--just by hanging out and learning the names of regulars.  </TEXT>

I was disgraced and fearful and miserable and I didn't drink.  I didn't drink the day I was sentenced or any day since that time by doing what I talk about all the time: I made a daily decision not to drink TODAY and I doggedly persisted.  No single event, no bad news or good, no sadness, no disappointment, no loss is too great to bear for one day.  Then I repeat, tomorrow.  

My life is filled with happiness, joy, and freedom because of the decision I make TODAY not to drink.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> OK, I'm glad I asked.  

Personally, I am not that different than you in terms of the underlying anxiety issues and to be honest, even though I live in a major American city (Cleveland) AA can be a little like high school from the standpoint of early sobriety.  On the other hand, given some blind courage and a gritting commitment to just go and actively listen my entire life (including my bipolar disorder) changed positively for the better.  Also, most of my preconceptions even about how I would be received were completely mistaken.  This has been my experience with AA everywhere I've gone over 30 years.  

Go it alone didn't work for me, but it may work for you.  Good luck, and I hope you will consider keeping /r/stopdrinking for support. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have so many activities that 24 hours is insufficient to the purpose, but I do remember that time in early sobriety when I felt at loose ends--what now?--I asked myself. I jumped into AA meetings and activities, that was huge.  Then I asked myself what did I always want to do.  In my case I always wanted to play guitar, so I signed up for an adult education class, then private lessons, and then I joined a group.  It was great.  I resumed avid cycling and I joined a cycling group for weekly night rides.  I joined a sober bowling and gold league.  My life was soon overwhelmed with activities. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Interesting, but I don't think the medical and mental health communities are at all focused on the "spiritual entity" part of recovery when they make the recommendation to attend AA meetings.  I think instead they realize that AA meetings are the most easily accessible, affordable, and effective programs of recovery.  

And might one, just "skip the middle man" and just go right to some conception of God?  If that were true there would be no drunk Roman Catholic priest, LOL!  In my experience, it is not a religious zeal, or spirituality that is at the heart of the recovery from alcoholism--it is instead an appreciation that ALCOHOL is the higher power and self will or will power alone can not in the usual case, beat the disease.  Instead a core recognition that the power of fellowship with like-minded others who are on a sober journey IS the solution.  From time immemorial, religious "cures" had been proposed and failed.  AA grew up as a radical reaction against the "moral" cure of the Women's Temperance Union, the Baptist pledge, and the Oxford Group.   </TEXT>

The Honda from the side street that I passed on my right pulled up beside me and the passenger rolled her window down and said, "You give all bicyclists a bad name."  I replied, "Yeah, that's a shame, but even people on bicycles make mistakes, though I'm sure you never do."

	<TEXT> This observation about speakers trying to convince themselves that AA works, may be true.  Remember, as they say in recovery "De-nile (denial) is not a river in Egypt" and in early recovery we are often still awkwardly selling ourselves on recovery.  Embedded in AA recovery is a form of cognitive behavioral therapy--a deliberate focus on changing behaviors in order to change thinking.  I often compare it to learning how to play guitar--which I successfully undertook in early sobriety.  At first it's really hard, awkward, uncomfortable.  Nothing came easily for me.  But as I slowly learned chords, scales, and songs and I practiced my brain automatically sped me up so that I sound pretty good even with my rudimentary skill set.  The same's true for new people in AA.  They may look awkward, or even phony, but let's not judge--in many cases these are the same hopeless, helpless drunks that made little or no sense when we sat on the barstool next to them staring at Sportscenter on the TV over the bar. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I describe this self-insight as that moment when I crossed the line from someone who is stopping drinking because it makes sense in light of all the bad consequences; to the ex-drinker who truly values my new sober life.  At this moment in my experience, cravings left me.  As long as I keep putting one foot in front of the other, I am confident I will not drink again. </TEXT>

Somebody once pointed out to me that our eyes don't see inward, we need to look to others for our own reflection--that sounds like what you did so powerfully in speaking of Fernando.  So I stopped drinking and I got sober by doing the things I describe at the [Baby Steps post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)  Maybe something there will be helpful to you.

	<TEXT> Wow you are in a dark place if I'm reading your post correctly.  I see myself 6 years ago, in your account of where alcohol has you.  I had to get help and stop drinking in order to find true happiness, and my authentic self.  Sustained sober time was an answer to the lies that alcohol was telling me and I got sober doing the simple actions I detail in the [Baby Steps post at this link.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)  Let me be clear: I can't be happy drunk when drunk I text others about suicide. That simply is not rational and I suspect you know it or you wouldn't be posting here.  Good luck and keep posting and commenting. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's interesting, almost the entire medical and psychological communities agree that alcoholism is a disease; but, the occasional dissenter when given voice in popular media or by Penn   Teller tends to animate the debate.  It's like the anti-vaxxer-thing in my opinion.  So why is alcoholism NOT a disease in their opinion?  Well, for a variety of reasons almost all of which are highly debatable--but, the big one is: you can't "catch" alcoholism like you can AIDS or Dengue Fever or Small Pox.  But alcoholism isn't an infectious disease (although if you think about it, maybe it is to some extent)--alcoholism or the disorders that we conventionally think of as alcoholism is more like diabetes or heart disease.  Our early life choices, and our genetic predispositions often bring on the disorder.  As far as I am concerned, I may not be responsible for getting my "disease" but I am wholly responsible for daily treatment. </TEXT>
