	<TEXT> I think the difference is that she has already graduated and therefore the university cannot do much directly. It's the Student's Union that is being hateful by continuing to employ her.

I wonder if there are other options open to the University, if they can't discipline her directly and if the SU refuses to do the right thing then perhaps they could just ban her from campus? </TEXT>

http://www.avoiceformen.com/mens-rights/opposing-shared-parenting-the-feminist-track-record/

The good news is that exposes of the track record of such groups has led to them purging the proof of their opposition to equal parenting rights from their websites, so they do at least seem to be becoming ashamed of that fact they openly opposed shared parenting </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  I think I finally met a Tory politician I like.

Same here, though the problem is that he's very much a Tory rebel rather than the norm. I expect he'd be popular with the grass roots of the party, the problem is that those in charge are mostly nothing like him really.


The fact that they've got one really good MP doesn't really make the rest of them any less shitty and out of touch with reality (though it does help a little that he's got a position of at least some importance).

It's also noteworthy that Raab has barely mentioned gender issues in the 4 years that have passed since he made these comments. I guess the various attacks from Labour, the BBC and the left are quite effective at silencing people from speaking uncomfortable truths. </TEXT>

There's been a very noticeable decline in the quality of newspapers here, the latest example being the Telegraph which haemorrhaged almost every single one of its best writers over the last few years. It has gone from perhaps the best UK newspaper as recently as 2008-10 to an average publication today. Therefore new developments such as the launch of Breitbart London are extremely welcome. </TEXT>

It's true that the original racist/sexist incident was weeks ago, but this is a new report, which outlines her response to the allegations of racism and sexism. I.e. it is a brand new development, with a number of different outlets all picking it up today.

Of course, most areas will have zero pro men's human rights candidates, though it's still worth doing your research. Furthermore, if there's a misandrist feminist standing in your area (or perhaps a pro-MGM religious nutjob) then please just go out and vote for any of their opponents. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Labour still beats the Lib Dems hand down when it comes to misandry.

Two of their equality ministers (harman and Hewitt) were found guilty of sexism against men, with one also given repeated official warnings from the statistics authority for lying about the gender pay gay.

I'd say the misandry of Labour's Vera Baird alone matches everything the Lib Dems have. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In legal matters there's a commonly used Latin expression which is as follows: **"Expressio Unius Est Exclusio Alterius"**. This translates to "The expression of one thing is the exclusion of another."

Such an expression might not be of much relevance were there numerous parties ignored by De Piero, or if there was another excuse or it it was sheer forgetfulness (for example if Mike hadn't showed p to the count or if she didn't know his name/party). However, Mike went out of his way to target De Piero and highlight her misandry and it's pretty obviously she's deliberately chosen the words she used. Even if she was so bitter an childish that she had decided against acknowledging him specifically she could have said " Helen, or Philip, or Simon and others" then that would have been ok. This didn't happen and therefore it's more than reasonable to assume she's against helping anyone who voted for J4MB unless she says otherwise.

Did you even read the article. They've already given a load of praise to a fringe party that isn't' even standing yet.

Furthermore, it's not really about airtime at all, but fair treatment. Had the BBC given 10 times a more coverage to J4MB than they did but continuing with the same spin and bias then everyone would have exactly the same concerns. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It barely gets any attention from anyone, but the only significant discrimination I can think of is the lack of HPV vaccine for boys.

It's far from exclusively an LGBT issue of course, and almost all aspect of men's health are underlooked/ignored by most politicians. However, of the 2,000 male lives every year, gay/bi men would be massively over represented.

Shame we don't see the LGBT lobby up really focus on this instead of the insignificant issues that do get attention. </TEXT>

Almost all men's issues are cheap to back or even have a significant gain for taxpayers. The government clearly hates men, otherwise they'd have implemented the cost saving ones ages ago just to save cash.

	<TEXT> J4MB are standing in two constituencies (was originally three) and plan to contest 50 next time around. The other candidate wasn't invited to his own hustings debate, therefore making this far worse than you suggest.

Also, I don't see why boys get their genitals mutilated without their consent (and at taxpayer expense) whilst females get protected by law. That's probably the party's strongest policy and it gets huge support. </TEXT>

They obviously don't like the party so decided to do everything within their powers to intimidate its members and sabotage their election campaign? The BBC is well know for it's left-wing SJW bias, though this particular example is particularly blatant even by their standards.

	<TEXT> A few questions I asked in my complaint:

1. What is your organisation's justification for banning men (and the discussion of their issues) from only UK hustings on the BBC to feature the political party in the western world representing the human rights of men and boys? Do you at least now accept it was clearly a mistake to do so?

2. Why couldn't a non J4MB seat be chosen instead?

3. Which member(s) of staff were responsible for imposing this gender based discrimination at such an historic event?

4. Why was Ray Barry not invited to his own hustings? Who was responsible for failing to send out his invites? Was this bias a deliberate act or supposedly a mistake?

5. When can we expect to see a men-only hustings discussing men's issues on BBC Nottingham prior to the 2015 General Election in order to ensure fairness and gender balance in your output?

6. When will Ray Barry get his chance to appeal to voters on BBC Radio Nottingham before the election?

7. How many members of staff at BBC Nottingham have a gender-feminist political outlook and are therefore naturally hostile towards the human rights of men and boys and/or J4M B? Did any of the individuals who are hostile or dismissive of J4MB have any role in this scandal?

8. Why was the very existence of J4M B portrayed as a problem on the Midlands Daily Politics broadcast? Why was Ray Barry yet again airbrushed out of existence?

9. When will we finally see the party engaging on-air with its supporters or at least the very many supporters of its ideas?

10. You all follow various political parties and local political personalities on Twitter, yet not a single one of you follow someone as high profile as Mike Buchanan. How do you expect to keep your listeners informed of stories relating to local politics if you're all blatantly ignoring one the the area's most significant political figures, someone who attracts global interest?

11. Have you apologised to Mike and Ray for the horrendous mistreatment of them and their party by BBC Radio Nottingham? If not when are you going to apologise? (I'd suggest doing so publicly, on air and BEFORE the election, not afterwards).

12. When are you also going to apologise to your male listeners for denying them a voice?

	<TEXT> It doesn't matter what their political position is, the BBC have clearly attempted to sabotage their election prospects.

Secondly, ignoring the slight Conservative bias, the fact is that 75% of the manifesto is mostly spot on and covers hugely important equality issues that get sept under the carpet. Furthermore, if there's specific media and entertainment industry ethics issues you'd want them to cover, or any mistakes you've spotted, then drop them a line in a couple of weeks. They do tend to be quite receptive to feedback. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Note that they also rigged most of the questions so they were about women's issues, therefore preventing J4MB from discussing its manifesto.

They also held a second (mixed gender) debate in the constituency of the second J4MB candidate, though they didn't actually bother to invite him to take part! (and he's their best speaker)

**Therefore the BBC has completely banned men in from any interaction whatsoever with the only men's party in the UK.**

The BBC is funded by a compulsory licence fee, and as a result is duty-bound to be impartial. What they have done breaks countless BBC editorial guidelines and it's blatantly obvious that they have directly interfered in the apolitical process and attempted to sabotage the campaign of a party who's views they disagree with.
