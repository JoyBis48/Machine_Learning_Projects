	<TEXT> Go at your own pace, do not force yourself to do anything that doesn't feel right. Listen to your body. 

Yoga is not a competitive practice, what other's are doing should not matter.

And I am paraphrasing Bryan Kest here: Activate your muscles, don't aggravate them. Find that sweet spot between too much and not enough, a happy medium.

Namaste, friend.  </TEXT>
