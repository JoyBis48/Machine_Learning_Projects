	<TEXT> I think you're probably right. Going to look up more examples but that ruddy/blood/orange color is VERY similar, and the white streaking is a dead ringer.

	<TEXT> The glutamate rush from a good dose of sulbutiamine is pretty unmistakeable and your senses stay heightened for several hours.

There's no way it should explode from that interaction. Pop the tires? Sure.
