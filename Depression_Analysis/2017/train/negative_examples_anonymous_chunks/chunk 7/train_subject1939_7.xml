	<TEXT>  I'm going to back the heck off and argue that right now is a golden age for both readers AND writers. There will be more written and published this year that I want to read than I will be able to read in my lifetime. The gatekeepers are being made obsolete by sites like Smashwords, and yes, Amazon. And yes, as a consequence, right now the market is being flooded. I agree. There is definitely a lot of crap out there -- but there's also a lot of great communities that help people wade through and find some absolute gems. That's the thing -- remove the gatekeepers and the words will flow.

I think it's weird that people assume that gatekeepers are a purely bad thing. "Gatekeepers" also make sure work that gets through is professional, edited, revised, formatted correctly, etc., in addition to theoretically making sure it is good. 

I think the ideal situation is one where gatekeepers exist AND there is a way around them, but where authors still get paid decently. A world where authors don't get paid well, but everyone and their mother can publish Harry Potter fan fiction is... fine I guess, but not a great way to insure good lasting work.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Tons of plot in the series does not involve the Starks at all and nevertheless contributes to its themes,

Sure, all to be fair the books start off almost all stark. There are 72 chapters, plus a prolog for AGOT. 53 (or 74%) are Stark characters. Tyrion and Dany are the only non-Starks with POV chapters (plus the one prologue) 

ACOK adds a few Davos chapters and Theon chapters (although Theon is a Stark ward so is part of the Stark tragedy), but is still basically all Stark. Book 3 adds Jaime and Sam (the latter is part of the Jon/Stark tragedy), but is again a majority Stark chapters.

It is really only in books 4/5 that Martin starts going into the other non-Dany / non-Stark storylines. That's when we really see the non-Tyrion Lannisters, the Iron Islanders, the Donrish, and so on.  </TEXT>

Tyrion is saved from death by Varys for no super logical reason (Varys risks losing so much there.) He escapes despite stopping to kill his dad. He is saved from the stone men, he is saved from drowning, he survives outside of Meereen... he's constantly surviving when probably most people would die. 

It's totally cool, almost all narratives do this. I'm just disagreeing that only the bad guys have luck while only the good guys have bad luck ala the post's original argument.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well we have to define what we are talking about. In Martin's world we aren't just following random people, we are following the RULING class. Kings, princes, generals. People who are born into wealth and power, or who gain it through war and conquest. 

Can you ever be a good person who gains power by war and conquest? Martin does a good job of showing how people can commit horrible acts but still be "nice guys" you'd want to have a beer with or whatever.  

But I agree it isn't necessarily intrinsic to the human race. It probably isn't even necessary in all parts of Martin's world. But it is intrinsic to a power structure like the Westerns world when you are in the ruling class.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I like this analysis! Although I'm not sure if it is entirely accurate. 

The books (and show) have kind of bent over backwards to help out our heroes many times over. 

Take **Tyrion**. He just happens to get one of the apparently best fighters in Westeros--Bronn--on his side? Bronn is a random sellsword who is both willing and able to defeat knights in fights to the death for a stranger and a little pay. 

Plenty of luck and plot armor has been needed for **Arya** to survive, or for that matter for **Jon Snow** to survive the wildlings adventure. Arya survives being around so many enemies for so long. Snow somehow doesn't get killed by wildlings who really have no reason to trust him, then survives climbing the wall and so much 

**Dany** has luck coming out the butt at every instance, although I guess since she is magic and prophecized you can explain it. I mean there a dozens way she should have died marching with the Drogo. Skipping her magic shit, she still should have died in the red wastes, or in Qarth, or in one of her various military campaigns in Slaver's bay. 

etc.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think it is certainly true that much fantasy serves as escapism, especially with the white washed nostalgia for the medieval era being so common (part of the ASOIAF appeal is that it makes that era look horrible instead of super awesome knights and princesses battiling evil with happy songs) </TEXT>

Not Thoros, the only other red priest in Westeros. 

This is a world where there is very little communication across kingdoms. Most of Westeros only knows vague rumors about Dany and her dragons. It's not like the red priests are calling each other on the phone discussing their crushes every night, you know?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's an uptick from digital books after Amazon did a lot to damage profits in print books for years though. I dunno, it's impossible to pose an alternative history and figure out if Amazon's nonexistence would have helped or hurt. 

I do think that in ANY industry having one player have so much control of the market is bad. It is doubly bad if that one player isn't really invested in the production, but just in the distribution and sales. 

I'm not sure piracy is as much of a problem in books as film and TV though. Even today, the print market is much larger than the digital market. People aren't as keen on ebooks as they are on digital music/film/tv </TEXT>

* Dany
* Jon Snow
* Bran
* Tyrion

Others I really don't think will die before then

* Euron (think he will be big baddy along with White Walkers) 
* Sansa (think she survives whole series, though she is certainly "killable" if Martin wanted)
* Arya

Character I hope lasts till near the end: 

* Stannis </TEXT>

Also, the fact that the NYT hosts the best seller list doesn't have much to do with their journalism or the reputation of newspapers in 2015.

In King's Landing alone, we will have to deal with Cersei and Margery and their dealings with the High Sparrow. That will probably take up all our King's Landing time, since we still have Jon Snow being killed, Stannis marching and maybe attacking, Sansa/Theon/Winterfell, Dany's advisers dealing with her leaving, Arya killing Trant, and probably a scene with Dany.  </TEXT>

a) The Wildlings fled south precisely because they couldn't survive north of the wall anymore. 

b) Even ignoring the White Walkers killing everyone with zombie army, the Wildlings were surviving during normal summer and winter. This is the long night, the horrible winter that will potentially destroy the world. 

 Or name yourself Lord Commander after saving the NW--they couldn't deny him that.

Yes they could, and that doesn't solve the problem of not having enough food to feed an entire army for years during an impossibly long winter anyway. 

 Use all that iron bank gold to buy food from Essos.

Winter has only started and the snows are so deep Stannis cant' even march! Trading ships from Essos are not delivering food to the Wall. It's cut off.  </TEXT>

Not sure i'd argue his death was good or bad, but Dany has Daario and her dumb husband as advisers, and then Tyrion comes and Jorah semi-returns. I can understand wanting to simplify things there. 

 I wish they would have stayed true to the books for that storyline. I thought the rape scene with Sansa was unnecessary and her being there is very strange for me.

Stayed true by having Ramsay rape and torture a fake Arya stark character who hadn't been set up yet? I think TV viewers who didnt' follow the books would be totally lost there.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Gotta disagree, I think the show (and books) make it very clear that blood is required for magic. Miri kills Dany's child to "save" Drogo. Dany kills Miri to waken the dragons. Stannis is half-dead after Mel creates the shadow assassins.  As for Thoros, I guess no blood is used exactly, but Beric comes back more and more a shadow of himself and LSH... well.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is a semantic question. What's the line between mythology and fantasy or folk lore/fairy tales and fantasy? Is the Odyssey fantasy? Are the Grimm fairy tales? 

Personally, I'd say the real first modern fantasy is whatever prose book that used fantasy elements but WASN'T directly based on or retelling myths/fairy tales/folk legends should count as the first real fantasy work.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Why do people seem to think writing a great show and sticking to source material NEED to be mutually exclusive?

I didn't say that. But you said they should have changed the plotlines they wanted to do in order to fluff up the show and make it take longer than they were planning for it to take. That doesn't make sense if your goal is the best show (according to their standards.) That only makes sense if you think staying behind martin matters the most. 

 It's at least one more year before you have to add filler. 

So now you want them to add "filler" to the show for possibly years and years until Martin finishes? If book 6 comes out in 2016, which is a big IF as far as I'm concerned, then it took Martin 5 years. It took him 6 years to do ADWD and 5 to do AFFC. So he is averaging over 5 years a book. 

So let's say he does 7 books (I think he will probably do 8 but...), that's 2021. And since the show has to be filmed and come out after that, we are talking 2022 for the show. The show is planning to end in 2017. You want them to add FIVE YEARS of filler just on the hopes of staying behind Martin? 

Honestly, your and my personal preferences aside, that's just logistically really hard. You have actors who want to do other things can't be locked into contracts that long. You have show runners who want to do other things. And you have the fact that GOT is the most expensive show ever made. Can it really sustain itself for 12 seasons? How many prestige dramas have lasted that long? Most Mad Men, Breaking Bad, The Sopranos, etc. type shows last half that, and they are much cheaper to make.  </TEXT>

It's totally rare, but that's just an extreme example. Even if you publish a book with a small indie press that only pays you 1,000 dollars, they will send a hundred or more review copies out, get your book distributed to bookstores, set up readings, radio interviews, and the like. 

Presses do a lot of marketing work.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That isn't really true though. Yes, all debut writers have to do some marketing, but that doesn't mean that presses don't do a ton of it for you and do MORE of it based on how they think you will sell. I just read an article about a debut novelists who got a 2 million dollar deal and his publisher (Knopf? I think) was sending out 6,500 advance copies to reviewers. Something like that is HUGE at getting your book talked about and sold.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Here's the thing though: studies say that 1 million books are published each year. The major publishers put out thousands of titles each year. Books have been written for centuries. 

So, there are many millions of books out there. 

As such you and me and everyone else relies on a ton of filters to decide what we read. Right? And those filters--from book reviews, to marketing budgets, to "the canon" taught in school, to what your friends read--are skewed by the racism and sexism in society. 

This isn't your fault or my fault or any individual's fault, but it's how everything ends up shaking out. 

So to be clear, I'm not saying YOU are racist or sexist. I'm saying society is. And it takes a lot of work to overcome that.  </TEXT>
