	<TEXT> Pros for Evo:

- Most prestigious tournament due to its long-standing history
- Insane competition. Have to battle out between 2000+ players
- Biggest fighting game tournament in terms of media, attention from FGC and mainstream public and amount of foreign players entering it
- Biggest points allocated as a premiere event
- Good prize pool


Pros for Capcom Cup:

- Insane competition. Have to battle out between the top 32 players of the entire year.
- Dat 120K and biggest ever prize pool.
- Points wise and organisation-wise from CPT, this is the most important event because every tournament leads to THIS.

What do you think?

	<TEXT> Daigo vs Momochi rivalry has been one of the most enjoyable rivalries for me to watch in Ultra SF4. Their meetings have been real close:

2014 Topanga Ranking Battle - Banzuke (Wakou): Daigo 2-0

2014 Topanga Ranking Battle - Banzuke (Akihabara): Daigo 2-0

2014 Topanga A League 4th - 1st Stage Online: Momochi 3-0

2014 Topanga A League 4th - 3rd Stage Offline: Daigo 8-6

2015 SXSW Invitational: Momochi 2-0

2015 Topanga World League 2: Momochi 5-1

2015 Stunfest: Momochi 3-2, Daigo 3-1, 3-1


Overall: 21-21

	<TEXT> He's being used as a strike bowler. One advantage he has over other journeyman workhorse bowlers is that he REAL pace, which is why his potential as a legit test bowler is still bright for him. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Remember when you said Momochi's Capcom Cup was self-explanatory? I wasn't sure what you meant so I went through his bracket again to check and he BEAT:

Snake EyeZ, Bonchan, Valmaster, Ryan Hart, Infiltration, Luffy, Xian (x2)

So he beat 3 EVO champions along the way to win the title. [](/Kreygasm) </TEXT>
