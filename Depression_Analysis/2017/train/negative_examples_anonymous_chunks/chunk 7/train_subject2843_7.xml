	<TEXT> Is that a type of food? I plan on mostly eating local food while I'm there, but I'm going for Muay Thai fighting with my husband. We will be just outside of Chiang Mai, in a village called San Kam Phang. We hope to stay for a year or two. My husband wants to become a legit Muay Thai fighter, I'm just going to train at the gym. I also want to get into the gem trade over there. I'm a big mineral collector. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm getting ready to move from the US to Thailand in about a month and I was wondering what would be the best way to bring some of my yarn stash with me. Could I use space bags to store the yarn or would that mess it up? Should I just have it shipped over? Anyone have any tales of moving to a different country and how they took their stuff with them? Thank you so much! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think it's a tad tight, but you know what I would do? I would keep it tight, and use that as motivation to make it looser by becoming more fit! (unless you are already fit, in that case I would just loosen it.):D </TEXT>
