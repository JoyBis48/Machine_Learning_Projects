	<TEXT> Not exactly. The photo was found on a roll of film after Corll was killed, belonging to one of his accomplices. He couldn't remember taking the photo or who the guy was, but was able to come up with a timeline based on when the camera was purchased.

In the photo the guy isn't strapped to Corll's torture wall, so odds are his nightmare was just beginning in this pic. The torture wall was what he cuffed them to when the actual rape/torture occurred. </TEXT>

*The evolution aspect is completely possible. Earth goes through a period of radiation, introduction of alien bacteria, etc. Not to mention you're applying evolution as observed on earth to beings from a distant planet.

*Harold Zoid. We know Decapods shed their shells when they become cramped, but Harold has been a shut-in for years. He's to poor to afford a new one, which would explain why he looks so decrepit. Not to mention it would explain his bad attitude because his soft body is painfully squished in his carapace. </TEXT>
