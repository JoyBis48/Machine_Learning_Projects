I can cum over THERE!

I can cum on her feet

I can cum in her hair!



I can cum in her mouth or down south

On her blouse in the house, 

On her face in this place

In her eye, but it'd make her cry



Hell, I can cum **any** place!

I shall, I SHALL cum on her face! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> have you considered that he has a significant other that he doesn't discuss on the show? He's talked multiple times about not wanting to discuss his private life on the show.

Also, the whole "banging chicks" thing IS a part of his CHARACTER'S persona! Danny Sexbang and Dan Avidan are two different people (one is fictional, if that gives you a hint)

Lastly, why would "not having a significant other" make him gay? Are only gay people allowed to be single? Or are gay people not allowed to have significant others?

This is a big reason he wouldn't want to discuss his private life. Creepy posts like this </TEXT>
