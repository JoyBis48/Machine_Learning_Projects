	<TEXT> Totally agree. I work for a consulting firm and we see this problem a lot in the private sector too. Companies take their best computer programmer, who loves what he does, and say "Hey this guy needs to be a manager!" Then they promote him to a job he hates and force him to deal with paperwork and HR issues instead of programming. 

If you have great technicians, reward them for being great technicians, don't try to wedge them into a role they don't want or aren't good at.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not exactly the same, but there was a Time article a while back (that I can't seem to find now) about therapists specifically hired by the CIA for their staff, since they would rather have them working with cleared staff employed by the Agency than private providers. 

It was pretty interesting, a lot of issues unique to that community like constantly obsessing over security details, like a guy who would drive all the way home and then worry "Did I lock my safe? Did I log out of my computer?"  and then drive all the way back just to make sure he did.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I lived in Chongqing for about 6 months and then in Beijing for a short while a few years later. I think there are definitely a lot of cool elements that you can find around the country, with as big as it is. My biggest impression was that growth and change are so fast that you'll see brand new buildings built right in the midst of old hutongs and a mix of old and new everywhere.

So it ends up being pretty cool to eat noodles from a street vendor cooked over a little charcoal stove, and then walk across the street to a neon-lit club blasting techno and k-pop. 

I'd definitely recommend it, but you may want to visit first or study there before taking the plunge and actually moving there for work.  </TEXT>
