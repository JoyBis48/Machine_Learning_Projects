Anyone know of the best options to have these done? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't know how your approaching online dating, the site your using, or anything else about what your doing.  So flying blind, here are some tips. 1) Take your time but be confident.  Forcing a meet up too soon seems aggressive. 2) Avoid talking about sexual topics before the second or third date, also seems aggressive. 3) avoid using snapchat and the like for anything until after a few dates.  You basically want your prospect to feel comfortable with you while still being confident to actually make it too and past the first date.  It's kind of a balancing act between social pace setting and taking the lead. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I know this is probably an unpopular opinion on reddit, but I think James Franco and Seth Rogan are starting to slip.  I really felt that was the weakest of all their films and a little too predictable.  The jokes are starting to just run from movie to movie.  Rogan started out great with all his other films, but unless they spend a little more time writing and a little less rushing movies, they won't turn it around.

	<TEXT> I interned in the kitchen and worked as a server there in 2010 and 2011.  At that level of restaurant the executive chef owner many times (as in this case) is a public figure head who is rarely in the kitchen.  The day to day leadership when I was there was Chris Jones, and Richie Farina.  Cantu spends most of his time working on other ventures.  The restaurant could easily survive, thrive even, without him. </TEXT>

I also feel sorry for anyone who invades Michigan or Illinois.  It would be the equivalent of invading Russia in the winter, there's no success their. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There is a lot of warning signs people can look out for.  Whether you are looking for yourself or someone else  they can be spotted by knowing the list and being a little self aware.  In my case I noticed it when I was choosing to always stay home, sometimes in bed, instead of accepting my friends invitations to go out.  Staying in and solitude can be beneficial, but I was turning down every invitation so I could be alone.  Search signs of depression and you can find a list, just keep in mind what sources are credible and which arent. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't know of any science or studies behind it, but I've noticed the same thing.   The only explication I can come muster is the more people, and more good times equals up to more distractions from just drinking.  If you focus on drinking you notice how tired or buzzed you are.  The bigger the party, the more you are focused on having fun.
