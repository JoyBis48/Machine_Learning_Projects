It is nice having a close support system if anything didn't go as planned, but it is beyond soul-crushing to relive pain every time you'd have to explain any not-so-good news.  Do what you feel is best :)

But I understand completely that it is hard to contain this news!

Edit: Forgot.  I told everyone before the pee was even dry on the test, so I didn't have a grand or interesting announcement.  But I do wish that I did!  It seems like fun to make it really special. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have seen the article.  What I got from it was that extensive use of ultrasound machine can slightly heat up body tissue and/or form air pockets.  

I have had 4 ultrasounds this pregnancy, two were from my Dr, 2 were elective at the boutique - type places.  I'm not a medical professional, but my logic is that if high-risk women get them quite frequently to monitor baby's health, the Dr wouldn't do anything to add harm to baby.  

I'm sure some people are excessive,  I wouldn't electively do one twice a week.  But my Dr says they are perfectly safe. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have the same one the other poster has!  I loved it, but the same issue as her, it was bulky and no clothes could hide it, unless I had a huge sweatshirt or something loose or big on.  

Another thing was, it would stay in place perfectly as long as I was standing or walking, but every time I would get up from sitting down  I'd have to take part of it off and readjust. 

But oh man, if you've been having back pain, it helps so much.  Right when I put it on, it relieves pain, I have no idea how it works so great.  I tried putting it on before I read instructions,  and I was so wrong, lol, so be sure to put it on right and it will work for you! </TEXT>

It continues a similar amount of time whether the doors are closed soon after or not.  And sometimes it will randomly do it while I'm driving.  So It was really stumping me.

Man, that guy on youtube even explains how to fix it, I wonder if I should attempt that.  But thank you very much! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They look for measurements to determine any abnormalities.  I wish I would have known at the time exactly what they measure.  My tech wasn't too vocal, just kept saying everything looks good.  

I read online that they measure the femur, if it is shorter than its supposed to be, that could be a marker for downs.
They see if a nasal bone is present.
Check the lips, for cleft.
All limbs in general.
My tech looked at the heart a long time, not sure how much they can tell about it on a 2d ultrasound, but they really study the heart.

Those are just things that I wish she would have told me she was looking at so I could know what she was doing.  It was still very fun watching.  Good luck! </TEXT>

Let the ones you love help you through it and empathize, but don't be upset when other people aren't as gracious.  They aren't being malicious, although it might hurt.  You have to be strong,  it takes a lot of time to feel normal again.
