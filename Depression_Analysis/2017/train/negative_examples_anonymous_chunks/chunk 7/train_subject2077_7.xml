	<TEXT> It'd look less like the revolutionary war and more like the iraq insurgency. Probably be lots of sabotage and sniping and IED's rather than outright "battles" in the traditional sense. 

Would just come down to how much it cost to give in to the insurgency's demands vs. continuing to resist.

America's a vast area with extremely varied terrain. Would be almost impossible to keep an eye and ready firepower on even most of it, let alone all of it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've always been a staunch supporter of captiol punishment, for a number of reasons. Foremost among them, there are some people who are - at a word - irredeemable. They commit crimes so awful that they cannot ever be trusted to return to society, they show no ability to ever be rehabilitated. 

Keeping such a person locked up removes them from threatening society, but it does nothing to prevent them harming other prisoners (who may have committed quite minor offenses), it does nothing to prevent them influencing people on the outside (this woman could seek to contact her living children, for example), it does nothing to stop them escaping (as those two killers in new york did recently). 

If a person cannot be redeemed and cannot rejoin society, then the best thing for everyone is an execution; it limits their suffering and it protects everyone from further harm.

I think this is probably the most i've ever written about my thoughts on the matter at one time, hah.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Incompetence to stand trial is (perhaps ironically) not really about mental health: it's about mental *state*. Someone can be totally batshit crazy, and so long as they realize what they are doing is wrong and a crime at the time they do it, they are mentally competent to stand trial.

One advantage of the competency system is that when we find someone to be incompetent to stand trial, it's pretty non-controversial - [Just check out this guy, for example](http://www.nj.com/morris/index.ssf/2015/01/immigrant_from_mexico_who_speaks_aztec_language_declared_mentally_incompetent_to_stand_trial_in_2011.html)  </TEXT>
