	<TEXT> There isn't always a buyer for every seller, it's why penny stocks are essentially useless, because you may not be able to liquidate them. If someone buys an obscene amount of BTC at once and never sells it then it will limit the supply and make it worth more. If people suddenly start dumping BTC then buyers will have the barter advantage and set a lower market price.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's because it's not used as a currency. Most gold is used to create jewelry which is not normally reintroduced into the market, essentially removing it from the world supply. If people were regularly walking into stores using their jewelry to pay for things then you would see the value of gold begin to drop. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The supply of stocks in a company is fixed but the value fluctuates, the supply of gold is (theoretically) fixed but the value fluctuates. Think of it this way, (for the sake of simplicity were going to assume that people only sell 1 BTC at a time) you've got X number of people trying to buy BTC and Y number of people trying to sell BTC. As long as X=Y the value of BTC remains the same. If XY the value of BTC increases, if XY the value of BTC decreases. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Idk the Nazis did some pretty twisted human experimentation too. For example the twin experiments are pretty terrible. They would seperate a set of twins and keep them in separate cells, then they would inject them with various chemicals and inject dyes into their eyes just to see if they would react the same. They would also sewed together twins to try to turn them into conjoined twins... it was some human centipede type shit. They also used jews as lab rats for testing various desalination methods, experiment nerve and bone transplant surgeries, and to test new forms of medicine and first aid they would infect jews with various lethal diseases and then try different ways to cure them or they would inflict phosphorus burns on them so they could try to treat them.

To expect police officers, most of whom never draw their weapon in the field during their career, to be able to do something that most experienced soldiers can't even do is ridiculous.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Because he's innovative. He's a rapper but he makes so much more. I mean, take [Street Lights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnTFdZSVyO4) for example. What is that? It's not rap, it's not rock, it's not pop, it doesn't really fit into any conventional genre. Same with [Lost in the World](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyQpQhrQ5Zs) (NSFW album cover), yeah it's got rap in it but it's not really a rap song. He's also the only artist that has been able to completely change their style for every album and still be successful. Listen to the polarity between [Never Let Me Down from The College Dropout](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JgtZHXEmvFQ), [Welcome to Heartbreak from 808s and Heartbreak](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaSopljm410), [Stronger from Graduation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsO6ZnUZI0g), and [Send it Up from Yeezus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbLkHhxK-lk). He has an innate ability to successfully change his style and still make good music. When most artists try to change their style they royally fuck up and lose fans. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks. I'm just wrapping up my freshman year now, second half of the second semester at my school. I got B's and B+s last semester and it looks like I'll be getting a couple A's and a couple B's this semester. My fear is that I'm not sure I'm going to pass the math class I'm in and it's worth 5 credits. Am I basically fucked for getting into Kelley if I don't pass? I switched it to P/NP grading but I'm still not 100% sure I can pass. I'm taking 18 credits so I'm hoping that they'll take that into account while considering me. </TEXT>

We didn't. But an innocent adult shouldn't have to die because a kid stole his parent's gun and decided to take it to the park. I agree that shooting a child should be the absolute last resort but you can't honestly blame a cop for doing it if the kid starts waving a gun in their direction. </TEXT>

On October 28, 2009 President Obama signed the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, attached to the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010, which expanded existing United States federal hate crime law to apply to crimes motivated by a victim's actual or perceived gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability, and dropped the prerequisite that the victim be engaging in a federally protected activity. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> what's the grounds for federal jurisdiction of any kind?

[The civil rights act of 1964](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_crime_laws_in_the_United_States)

Although state laws vary, current statutes permit federal prosecution of hate crimes committed on the basis of a person's protected characteristics of **race**, religion, ethnicity, nationality, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, and disability.

Considering the geographic location of Mississipi and its history of racism if this isn't a suicide then it's a hate crime. Local law enforcement agencies in southern states do not have a good reputation when it comes to investigating and prosecuting hate crimes so it's best that the FBI handles the entirety of the case.

	<TEXT> No they shouldn't. This is perfectly legal. The civil rights act of 1964 gave the FBI authority to investigate any racially motivated crime against anyone attempting to perform one of six federally protected activities. A 2009 amendment signed into law by Obama removed the prerequisite that the victim had to be engaging in a federally protected activity for the FBI to get involved. Considering the culture of a place like Mississippi it is better for the FBI to be on scene from the get go before evidence is tampered with. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The problem with that is that there's no way to reliably account for something like that. You can say X% of companies go under due to fraud or other out of market forces but there's no way to say which companies will do that. From an investing standpoint the chances that you'll pick a fraudulent blue chip company are too low to justify the lowered rates of ROI from diversifying beyond 25-30 stocks. It's not possible to invest with meaningful returns without risk. obviously there's no reason to start spending significant amounts of money buying up penny stocks, but within reason higher risk=higher potential returns. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> but there comes a point when adding more stocks to your portfolio ceases to make a difference. There is a debate over how many stocks are needed to reduce risk while maintaining a high return. The most conventional view argues that an investor can achieve optimal diversification with only 15 to 20 stocks spread across various industries.

	<TEXT> August Busch the 4th. He was handed the CEO-ship of Anheuser-Busch and arguably ran the company into the ground.

He wasnt just "handed" the company. He had worked in various positions for nearly 20 years (1989-2006) before he was selected by the then president (who was not a member of the busch family) to be his successor. Your idea that he ran the business into the ground is a bit odd. Yes, he was unable to hold onto the business but he sold it for $20/share above wjat the record highest share value of the company was, so it's not like he lost his family or shareholders any money. If anything they turned a significant profit.

Ivy level education: 

Cheating is prevalent at any university, whether it's through the use of amphetamines or through collaboration on take home exams. Grade inflation is an interesting topic when you're talking anout Ivy schools and it certainly needs to be addressed, but the fact remains that even getting into an Ivy school is a feat of it's own. Nobody going to harvard can be called lazy or stupid. 

MBA programs: 

If you're not attending a top 15 MBA program then you shouldnt be paying for an MBA program. Every top ranked MBA program (with the exception of harvard iirc) requires that you have at least 4 years of experience prior to enrollment. Eneolling in any old MBA program because  "that's just what you do" isnt going to help you. The type of people that can get into a good MBA program are destined to be execs of large companies, so attending a program like that essentially gives them 5-10 years of experience worth of management knowledge in 3-4 years. It also lets you network with other future execs. Any old MBA program won't do that for you.

 Holding individual stocks is more akin to gambling than investing

Not really. If you have 16 blue chip stocks in various unrelated industries then safety wise your portfolio is as diverse as one that has 50 stocks. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Mdma is a weird drug. It's not a stimulant in the same sense that coke and other amphetamines are stimulants. If you're taking real MDMA and you're not taking anything that'll interact with it then it shouldn't feel speedy or edgy or anything like that. You start out feeling a rush but then that sort of goes away and you start "peaking" which makes you feel euphoric and happy. The come down can be kind of rough but that can be mitigated with various vitamins and supplement. A lot of people get an "after glow" ranging from a few days to a few weeks that can make you feel happier and more empathetic. </TEXT>

Yes, some of them may have inherited the job but they still needed to complete an Ivy level education and most likely make it through a decent MBA program. Their dad wouldn't have given them the position if they were a failure. If you're unaware of what exactly a fortune 500 company is, it's a top 500 performing *public or closely held corporation*. No stock broker worth their salt is going to keep their clients money in the stock of a company that just made a coked out retard the CEO. And nobody with stock in a closely held corporation is going to let a coked out retard become the CEO. Blaming nepotism or cronyism for your own professional inadequacies is a cop out. Nobody is going to hire you for being average. If you want to work in the world of high level corporate america then you can't just sit on your ass through college, you need to get a kick ass GPA so you look good to recruiters, and you need to befriend as many people as possible because when you're talking about positions that can make or break a company people hire people that they know and can trust, not just people that look good on paper.

So if the odds are 3:1 or whatever that the team will either lose or win with a 7 point spread then it would benefit him more to keep his team from winning by more than 7 points than actually just winning all out.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> TIFU by not buying new boxers after losing a significant amount of weight. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-03-10 08:24:40 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So over the course of my first year of college I've lost about 50 pounds which is amazing! What's even better is that the cute girls have started talking to me! However, while I've downsized my entire wardrobe I haven't bought new boxers because a lot of them still fit due to the elastic waistband. Well last thursday I was in a rush to get to class so I grabbed a random pair of boxers and threw on a pair of shorts and ran out the door. Now, this is key, my dorm is far enough from the main campus that people either ride bikes or take the bus to class. I decided to take the bus on this particular day. I take my seat and at the next stop a 10/10 sorority girl (Alpha Phi, yeah, this is serious business) sits down next to me. I mustered up some courage and decided to start talking to her. Surprisingly enough we hit it off and by the time we get to campus I'm making her laugh. Now this is wear the fuck up happens. When I sat down on the bus my boxers must have slid below my belt because the moment I step off the bus I feel them start slipping. What's even worse is that it turns out this girl is in the lecture I'm going to and we've still got a half a mile to walk. We walk a bit further and these things are going. I'm doing my best to hold on to them through my pocket without looking awkward as hell but it's not going well. We walk a bit further and that's when it happens, I lose control and now my boxers are just resting on the crotch of my shorts. I look down and you can see them hanging through the leg holes of my shorts. I look like some retarded gangster that's doing a reverse sag look. At this point I'm just praying this girl doesn't look down. 

This is when I luck out, I see a couple of my friends a ways away and I text both of them "911 need wingman asap." Now these guys are pros, they start walking over without hesitation, and when they get close enought see her aphi shirt they know that this isn't some joke. I gestured at my shorts and they leapt into action. They say what's up to me and introduce themselves to her and then distract her for just long enough for me to step behind her and reach into my pants and pull my boxers up. Now, to anyone else in the area this probably looked weird as fuck, but again this girl IS A MOTHER FUCKING ALPHA PHI, and desperation measures needed to be taken. I mean you show me a campus where aphis aren't the hottest girls. The wingman intervention was a successful and I sat next to her all through the lecture and I've got plans to hang out with her and some of her sisters this weekend. 

**TL;DR** boxers fell down so far they were visibly below my shorts while I was talking to a hot as fuck girl, friends intervened with a distraction, and I successfully fixed boxers and got girls number. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Due to the location of my university I'm friends with a lot of kids from rich areas of Los Angeles. I know for a fact that most of them get their coke and molly in person from dealers. The difference between their dealers and dealers in the poorer neighborhoods is that their dealer is only once or twice removed from the trafficker. Whereas in the poorer neighborhoods the coke may have gone through 10 different dealers before it reaches the street level dealer. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I feel you but at the same time there is a line. Take my roommate for example. He's on his PC from the moment he wakes up to the moment he goes to bed with a small break for school. He neglects taking care of himself, he showers maybe once every week or two, and he hasn't socialized with anyone irl besides me and the friends I bring home since the beginning of the school year. His only form of social interaction is when he's playing steam with his friends from high school. In some ways he's worse than a functional alcoholic. His mouse broke about a month ago and he literally went through withdrawals while he was waiting for a new one. And yet in his twisted little mind he thinks that what he's doing is morally superior and healthier than me going out and getting fucked up with my friends every weekend.

Yes you should respect other people's lifestyles, but at the same time denying that there's such a thing as too much computer time is wrong too.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well no but they try to rush an amount that wouldn't lead to competition to live in the house. So enough that youve got a sizeable pledge class, but not so many that even if 20% of each class decides to live out you have to raffle out rooms. If you're rushing 20 pledges twice a year and you've only got 25 bedrooms you're going to have issues, even if you have a senior house.  </TEXT>
