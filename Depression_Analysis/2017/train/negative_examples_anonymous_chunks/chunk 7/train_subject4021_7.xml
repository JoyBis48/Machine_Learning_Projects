	<TEXT> Its a tactical squad shooter.If you played Ghost Recon before then theres your explanation.If not,well youre basically in a squad with a couple of other people,and you get objectives(Take out other squad,capture locations).Its based in Vegas(duh) spec ops teams and it uses cover systems like Mass Effect(if you played it).Yes,yes it is fun but its an old game nonetheless. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ok,after playing the game all i have to say is that it aint that bad guys.Yes,for some reason i think the first one looked better,played better and all in all just WAS a better game.The problem with this game is the same with DmC:Devil may Cry.It would be a great stand alone game.But as a long awaited PvZ sequel?Meh. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi!As we all know,the two games they gave out this month were based on being open world(ish).So what bundle do you think they might give next?Im rooting for a Witcher+Dragons Age title,which would make sense.Or something like a Oblivion(lets be honest,we aint getting skyrim) + Fallout 3,which are both fantastic titles.


Anyway,i want you hear what you guys think!



EDIT:Well its magic the gathering 2013 and rainbow six Vegas.Seems like none of us can predict for shit.Well,see guys later this month in another Predictions thread! </TEXT>
