	<TEXT> My factory charging cable was DOA, so the VZW store gave me a 3rd party one.  This one has a little LED that lights up when you hold it and goes off when you are either charging or not touching it.  After a few days, the light will stay on all day every day, and then after a few more days, the connector got to 135 degrees.  I  swapped it out for another one and it is doing the same thing, but not getting too hot yet.  

I think the turbo charger is breaking this aftermarket cord.  I've ordered some longer non-lit ones and hopefully it's going to be ok. </TEXT>

Good site.  So here's my issue.  I travel for work, so I'm all over the states that I cover.  Sometimes these locations are out in the middle of nowhere and I need to be able to pull up their info from salesforce.com or call them to make sure we are still on or have to change the times we are scheduled to meet.

If I only lived and worked in the bigger city ( Seattle...Where T-Mobile's HQ is, Tri cities, Spokane)  Then it would be a non issue since they are mostly the same.

http://puu.sh/hWZa1/d288744fcf.jpg - Verizon 3g/4g coverage

http://puu.sh/hWZfE/4f575d052e.jpg - TMO 3g/4g

http://puu.sh/hWZhm/4bd0419c6f.jpg - Sprint. 

If you look at all the little pockets of places where VZW has decent 3G/4G coverage, it's clear that there is way better coverage in way more places in WA.  It's even more apparent in Oregon.

If you zoom out a bit more, it's laughable. 

http://puu.sh/hWZEn/181dd5fcbe.jpg --TMO
http://puu.sh/hWZGS/e7252bc5fe.jpg --VZW.

I would love to stop over paying VZW, but where I go, coverage is king. </TEXT>

I remember going to the international auto show a few years back and both BMW and Hyundai had matte paint jobs on their display cars.  They were roped off and you weren't even allowed to touch them.

	<TEXT> I was looking in to an Anytime Fitness Franchise. 

Everything in the contract stated that I had to pay no matter what happened.  Even if they do things to hurt my membership numbers.  Similar to Quizno's, they could have upped the rates of all the equipment used to run the place at anytime and there was nothing I could do about it.  They control the entire process.

They also wanted an unlimited personal guarantee. They wouldn't budge on this.  They wanted to be able to take EVERYTHING I HAD, unlimitedly, in order to get what the contract stated.  On top of that I had to sign another similar deal for the lease of the building.

In the end it would have cost over 1 million in startup and fees over 5 years, and I wouldn't have anything to show for it because I really didn't own anything. I was leasing everything.

I could see if you had the money to startup 6 of them in decent areas, you could make a pretty penny, but it wasn't right for where I was at at that time. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I came in to Seatac very late last night and I found a high end smartphone sitting on a bench while waiting for the shuttle to pick me up.

The battery was dead, so I charged it up and turned it on, but it had a lock pattern, no emergency contacts and the SIM card was already cancelled.  I went to a local store that matched the carrier and they said that the person was from Houston. I left it with them, so they can contact the owner.

**TL:DR  If you are/were visiting Seattle in the last day or so and lost your phone, it's at the carrier store at the mall in Lynnwood, Wa.**

Good luck. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  I bet that the CEO would blow $500 on a single dinner.

In drinks alone.

I am willing to bet that if you were 5 minutes late(measured by a machine) that some asshole manager shit on you and put you on probation.

At Best Buy, that was the one thing people got fired for like 90% of the time.  Easiest way to get rid of problem workers, and an easy way for middle management to show upper management that they were actually doing something.

In a more serious note, there might be something to the "entitlement generation" but I see it more as a generation that was told "you need to go to college so you don't have to have a laborers job.  Those jobs are for losers"  

I'm in the 1978-1997 generation and that's all I was told by my parents, my friends were told the same thing.  Now we are the same people that have over $1 Trillion in college debt with blue collar workers aging and declining.  Someone with a masters degree in education might make $40k a year and have 6 years of school to pay for, while someone that was an apprentice electrician for the same time could make twice that after reaching journeyman with no debt.  But we sure as hell weren't given that as an option.

  THAT is the actual result of this "entitlement generation" </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Holy crap... The amount of people that think vandalism is OK and no big deal blows my mind.  

Sure it's a few scratches in some man made thing, but it's the principle of the deal.  How disrespectful is it to visit somewhere, and then deface it?  Kids will be kids, but when they do it IN FRONT OF YOU, you should do your fucking job as a parent and teach them to respect property that isn't yours.  

How is this a hard thing to grasp? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I had thought about that but there wasn't any really good documentation I could find on how project Fi works software wise.  The FAQ says 
 If you're not using your Nexus 6 and you've opted-in to use your number to talk and text on other devices, you can make calls over Wi-Fi using your number through Google Hangouts.

So this might be an issue people run into that want Project Fi but don't have a Nexus 6.

I have the app, but no invite, so I can't test it out to see what that app actually does and how it's different from Hangouts or the regular dialer. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Google Hangouts/Wifi Calling uses as much battery as screen? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-05-05 02:12:32 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> In preparation for the Project Fi, I wanted to see what it'll be like using Google Hangouts as VoLTE or Wifi calling. 

Today I took the phone off the charger at 11am and had to take a 2+ hour conference call.  I called in to the number with the Hangouts app, then joined the meeting and had the screen on most of the time as I needed to mute/unmute when needed. 

I had expected the screen to suck down the battery pretty bad, but when I was done with the call, I looked and I had 50% battery left.  I go in to the battery stats and the screen and the hangouts app both had the same amount of battery useage at about 16% each.  Under the hangout app, it said it had 2+ hours of CPU usage time.

I'm pretty sure if I had used the normal dialer for this call, it wouldn't have used near what the hangouts app did.  I was on my home Wifi at the time, not LTE.  The phone is the Verizon branded version and the rom is stock, but rooted.

Is this something that anyone else has experienced?  I've tried searching around and nothing has specifically described this issue.   </TEXT>

I think that was an auto correct for camber. right?

If you have it lowered, then you usually do need a camber kit.

If not, and you are having alignment issues, just take it to a place that does alignments. </TEXT>
