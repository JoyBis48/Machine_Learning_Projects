	<TEXT> dota merch comes with codes for cases (whatever dota calls cases) that pay for themselves (roughly) on the steam market place.  CSGO merch costs an arm and a leg, and has no codes (apparently). 
  
Not that the in-game items matter all that much to me, its just crazy how differently valve treats their 2 most popular franchises.  CSGO has been paying the bills as of late, and we get expensive shirts back.

That being said.... in for one coffee mug.... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think the group stages should have either been online, or more spread out over a couple days.  It was a ton of matches all overlapping.  If they spread it out they could have focused more on individual matches, afforded reasonable computers, and brought the quality way up.  12 odd hours of bo1's is ridiculous.  Now on day 2 its like they can return 75% of the rented computers. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Last night my team was up something stupid like 13-2 going into ct side mirage.  Our bottom fragger was well above their top.  The rest of the game we bought mollys and mollied up our entire spawn, then we'd all start yelling stuff like "Rush through mollies , Push push push, gotta guard sites!"  We lost a few rounds because of it, but definitely worth it for a good laugh.  We also had one dude shoutcasting but telling us wrong spots for everyone, kept us on our toes when we all rush market while the terrorists are pushing out apps. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'd try to watch a couple pro games, just so you have some amount of map awareness.  Also play some casual, and a lot of deathmatch to work on learning maps and aim.  Don't stress if you die a lot in casual,  in comp mm they sort you by similar skill level and in casual I don't think they do.  Lots of hackers also hang out in casual.

  The thing that helped me the most was learning how to set my mouse dpi and sensitivity correctly, then learning how to move efficiently with a much lower dpi.  There plenty of youtube videos on that.

  If your team makes calls in a mm game don't be afraid to ask them if you don't know a nickname (Cat, Tetris, Jungle, etc etc).  You might get flamed a bit, but its just internet people.  You will learn and possibly never see them again.

	<TEXT> I played 120odd hours, I had fun most of them.  I did vog the week it was released.  At the end nothing dropped for anyone. Thought it was broken.  Went to find loot tables for raid rewards.  "Oh I guess there are none".  Haven't turned the game on since.

I was a wow raider, thought Destiny would scratch that itch.  Like an mmo-lite.  I don't care if I don't get a reward for doing the hardest content in the game.  In an mmo raids have loot tables, you certainly dont get something every time.  But someone in your party will.  An item worth coming back for every week to get.  An item that doesn't have the same low chance to drop off any mob in the whole game.

 Without raid specific gear whats the point of getting to end game.  Without pvp specific gear what's the point of pvping.

Sorry for my rant, incredibly off topic.  What im getting at is I got my moneys worth, I liked the game.  But dont see any point in going back.  Plus I dont own the dlc's.  $70 for the dlc+tk is too much overhead for me to come back. Shit I payed 60 for the game.  Essentially this is a really long "I agree". </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think it's more the closed system thing.  On ios they are developing for 4 phones and x amount of ipads.  They know the exact details on every piece of hardware the game is running on.  It is much easier to optimize for less systems.

If a huge publisher like Bethesda puts out an android game and it hypothetically doesnt run on htc phones for some reason then they would get bad press and have their validity as a games developer questioned.  

Im pretty sure they just want to release a game that works  Hopefully it comes sooner rather than later. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The rank you are looking at is a temporary thing for the latest event.  You get an actual rank at 10 comp wins.

I consider myself new to the game.  I have ~300 hours played, and 60 odd comp wins.  You need to realize this is a game people have been playing in some form for 15 years or so, even the low rank people are going to be much better than you when you first start.  

Yes people hack and smurf, but generally people who play cs are good at cs.  Plus if people have a high degree of map awareness they are going to beat you even if you are possibly better at fps games than they are.

Stick with it though, it's a great game.  There's nowhere to go but up. </TEXT>

Did you try going back and using integrated graphics just to make sure it isn't crashing on you.
Check and make sure the ram is installed in slots 0 1, it will probably be the far right slot, and second from the left. (it probably isn't a memory issue if it wasn't crashing before the video card)

Are you using both 24pin and 8pin motherboard connectors? Is the power going to your gpu seated properly? I think its 8 and 6 pin pcie power, but i don't quite remember.

If you have access to a known good power supply you could try that, it would suck rma'ing another part that's good. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So I have my build all put together, just staggered as normal when choosing the mobo.  Currently I have the GIGABYTE GA-Z97X-Gaming 5 in my cart.
I only need 2 usb 3.0 headers. I'm only planning on running a single gpu (at least for the next few years.)  Probably never going to use more than 4 sata ports.
I like the idea of having the m.2/sata express just in case.  They aren't essential, but a little more expandability never hurts.  Especially out of a budget board.
I love the Gigabyte dual bios switch, it saved me multiple times with my current ud5h/ivy-bridge combo. (apt to say dual bios chips are essential to me, but i guess if something great comes along I'd settle.)

Are there any better options in the price range?  Future things I'm not thinking about?

edit: ATX from factor.  I also generally don't overclock, at least not until it gets late enough in the life cycle where I need to start pushing my hardware's limits. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Just noticed logitechs high end model is on sale for 50% off today.  I don't have any experience with it, but I figured it might be useful if your still looking in the $50 range.

	<TEXT> I use a logitech c310 it's pretty adequate, good under good lighting, not great under poor lighting.  If you have a digital camera you could see if there is any way to plug it in and use it as a webcam. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm assuming you can speak well enough that people can understand you.

I don't see any issues,  if anything it could be a big self confidence boost.  So long as you don't mind periodic hecklers.  twitch chat isn't all that bad.  sure if you go into a room with 50k people there are going to be a ton of assholes, but when you first start you will gain followers that enjoy you and your content.  if you get big then you get a couple early followers/friends to moderate, and take it all in stride.

Good luck!  make sure you post if and when you start!  and good luck finding a comfy set if teeths! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> likewise, the shop I've been going to for years told me they couldn't cut a fork and tap in a star nut until mid-next week.  Pretty sure the shops are just super busy right now, I understand them taking care of people buying a new bike from them first. </TEXT>
