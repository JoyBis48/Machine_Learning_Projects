	<TITLE> Are there any Youtube channels or users who recut trailers for popular movies to remove spoilers? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> I stopped watching the new Bond trailer halfway through. Usually, I don't care, but it seemed like overkill showing me every action scene and important female line in the movie. [When I heard](#s "He's protecting someone and then saw the blonde woman,") it just *hit me* and I decided that was too much info for how sold on the movie I already was.

Does anyone recut trailers to save movies from their marketers? Do they, maybe, have a low ^/medium ^^/high content threshold for people who want different amounts of spoilage?

One could argue Bond movies have always given away a lot, but that doesn't mean they have to now. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> random list of things I hope to do next time I look at a property: 

* Bring a 100 ft tape and mark out any specimen trees (you want) or physical obstacles to building.

* Figure out where the sun will rise and set, and how high above the level horizon it is (mountains or trees on adjacent property).

* Note which way the wind blows, and look for signs it might not always blow that way.

* If you want to to mob grazing (check out Joel Salatin and Allan Savory) you could even leave trees in strategically to create attachment points for mobile fencing.

* You probably already checked the soil map, but taking a look at dirt won't hurt.

* Double check water sources and rights.

* You in a flood plain?

* Inquire with neighbors as to power outages and nuisances. </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2015-07-21 16:38:59 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> The [article](http://civileats.com/2015/07/13/what-it-takes-to-make-a-decent-living-raising-ethical-meat/) is short enough, but notice there are two books.

1. *[Farms with a Future](http://www.amazon.com/Farms-Future-Creating-Sustainable-Business/dp/1603584382)* was written first and is apparently a series of interviews and observations.

2. *[The New Livestock Farmer: The Business of Raising and Selling Ethical Meat](http://www.chelseagreen.com/the-new-livestock-farmer)* seems to me to have more appeal for theoretical study, since it is a derivative work which makes a point to address how things should be done, nothow others are doing them.

When we discuss externalities in food production, we can talk about the effects on resources, animals, food products, consumers, and the competitive market. I hope to be able to find someone who can communicate clearly the weight I place on social matters as externalities, or develop that message myself. It is one thing to remark on industrial animal farms as inefficient, but another to say when they replace more local food production it has more human detractions. The second message may win us more friends, allies, and converts.

(edit: both books are available on Amazon. I think there is a 25% discount when you sign up for the publisher's mailing list when bought through the Chelsea Green site.) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The Hampton Mansion, north of Baltimore, was the largest residence in America when finished in 1790. The empire-like holdings the Ridgley family had control over dipped heavily into early industries such as ironworks, mills, quarries, and armories which eventually supplied much of the cannon ordered by the Continental Congress for the revolution.

I would say you are correct. The multiple large cities in the area greatly improved the market for inorganic materials and processing services which have a faster rate of return than farming.

It would be interesting to see if there was a difference in marketing for the local tobacco versus the more southern tobacco. I think the southern product was exported overseas, while urban Marylanders would enjoy the bounty of their neighbors. Marketing overseas includes great risk and overhead, meanwhile the Ridgleys could sell to Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington, Wilmington, and settlers headed west. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 1. These new mental health facilities and associations may not all be good, and some go bad over time. This isn't a reform looking backward, but forward.

2, 3. It depends how successful any movement is, whether or not bureaucracies will fall.

4. I don't think I see any direct comment through that article's content.

One of the problems with mental health is that in the past we have not had many cases of people being "cured." The terrible situation where once a person falls into a problem, they never crawl out. This is as costly as a lifetime sentence in prison.

Today we have the benefit of improving nutrition and finally have real empathic counseling. Not every patient has a chance of full recovery, but many cases of depression and anxiety can be relaxed by giving people the strength to return to normal life and the lessons to remain with us. We are leaving behind the inhumane and despicable "treatments" of old.

One of the "trusting" aspects of saying *if one political faction makes changes as they see fit, what will happen* is that you have to trust the economy will get better. We all think our way will make it better, so I would extend the same hypothetical to any other suggestion. When an economy gets better, people have more time for personal projects and family, a greater possibility of gaining capital, and less-tight budgets. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  the libertarian solution to our mental health crisis?

1. Tort reform to repair us to a "loser pays" system. This enables little guys who have a definite winning case, but no money, to take on corporations with legions of lawyers.

2. FDA told to let all medications meeting basic, fast, approval onto the market. Doctors and consumers should be responsible for using healthy treatments and [private associations can be formed to guarantee product quality.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvxT7fryE3Q) This enables products excluded by the cost of FDA approval to come to market and allows new products to take on old ones without lobbyists preventing the FDA from approving.

3. The VA would stop automatic prescription of psychotropic medication. Our vets need real, personal, mental health guidance. People can be counseled out of darkness, it isn't a chemical imbalance. [There is no evidence of a chemical imbalance causing emotional or mental changes in a way like we hear from pharmaceutical companies.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ARZ2Wv2BoFs) (By the way that ain't some internet quack)

4. (Presuming a libertarian government is making more decisions and cutting government spending) Reduced taxes and maybe even a restored currency would enable more charitable giving and investment in philanthropic ventures. Families living in fear of siblings or children would have more options for where to send their troubled relatives for help.

This is off the top of my head. I wonder if #2 would help stop family physicians from being barraged with commissions from pharma companies to prescribe quotas of psychotropic drugs. Doctors would also be responsible for commending and recommending patients to mental health facilities. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>   figuring that settles the issue

You'll have to point out where I said that, or inferred it. I gave you some things to watch. That doesn't mean I considered it the end-all be-all. Obviously, since we are still discussing it.

 The dichotomy between Keynesian and Austrian capital models come to mind very quickly.

Those are different understandings of a single reality. There are similarities and differences in the understandings and since we are not omniscient, neither one can be proven - though parts can be disproven (As Keynesianism/ use of econometrics has been on a philosophical basis by Austrian Econmists).

 unique moral priority to their culture

I find that humanity has a single morality. Different cultures have different traditional responses to their environments which color morality (espiecially in the absence of Christianity).

 Capitalism fitted the people with a yoke akin to slavery.

As I said, G.K.C. created his own definition of good, pure capitalism (distributism) and relegated the term "capitalism" to crony capitalism in his work. Businesses profiting by use of the force of the state to oppress and repress workers and competition being akin to a yoke of slavery? That I agree with and think he did too - but that is referring to a political mess not a system or quality of economics.

I am a hopeful anarcho-capitalist, though I realize that future is troubled and dim at present. I hold a county-level party position in the Republican party and a leadership position in both a state-level and county-level groups partial to Ron Paul, though nonpartisan.

I am not nice on the internet. Don't know why. Maybe I'm too nice in person. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  But I still find it interesting that the Nazi's base of power was in Munich and Bavaria (largely Catholic), but that the locals there still did not support them in large numbers

If the NAZI party tried to base somewhere more mild to their views, rabid supporters like one finds in a minority would not be present. Rather, there would be the diffident reactions one expects from people who agree but are not surrounded by people holding ideas they dislike enough to value activism over working or family. In Bavaria, Hitler probably found people who despised the local norms and made sure to turn up at every event. Supporters from other parts of the nation who were strong enough lent what they could. Disrupting the norm gave them national acclaim.

I am hypothesizing, not dictating from research. </TEXT>

 Obviously don't leave raw meat in warm water for hours, but just to defrost? Its fine.

These two are tied together. If meat is left in the bacterial growth range of temperatures too long and then cooked, it isn't the bacteria you have to worry about - but the toxins they leave behind. If defrosted horribly incorrectly, a meat can still be unsafe when cooked. </TEXT>

There is no such thing as "an expression of capitalism." Capitalism is not political. Capitalism is the use of savings and trade. Chesterton did accept this definition - though he wrapped it in much discourse - but then he liked to be the person making the definitions rather than using someone else's. His main problem with economics was how few people had capital instead and how many had wages because they had no capital. Distributism solved that voluntarily. But that is the thing - a true free market is created by and regulated by voluntary action. Chesterton made Distributism to give free market capitalism a new name, to scoot out from the influence of governments.

"We are so horribly unjust..." Who is horribly unjust? The small business owner who has to choose how to split up 60 hrs of work per week between two employees? The daycare owner who has to comply with mandated regulations and pay legal insurance because tort is unreformed? Can we even *really* blame the corporations for lobbying the governemnt to control and capture our legislatures and regulations, respectively? A corporation is a protected class of private organization only possible thorugh governemnt law and corporations only want to lobby because the government has power over their sectors and industries... so maybe the solution is to remove power from the government at various levels and return a large degree of subsidiarity to our nation?

So that last comment wasn't so much ad hominem as particularly broad. You are making nonsense statements and need more grounding in the background of the development these ideas underwent from different sources than you are used to. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> [ ...historians with an ideological axe to grind against the market usually ignore an authoritative 1906 report of the Department of Agricultures Bureau of Animal Husbandry. Its investigators provided a point-by-point refutation of the worst of Sinclairs allegations, some of which they labeled as willful and deliberate misrepresentations of fact, atrocious exaggeration, and not at all characteristic. ](http://fee.org/freeman/detail/29-upton-sinclairs-the-jungle-proved-regulation-was-required)

Same article -

 According to the popular myth, there were no government inspectors before Congress acted in response to The Jungle, and the greedy meat packers fought federal inspection all the way. The truth is that not only did government inspection exist, but meat packers themselves supported it and were in the forefront of the effort to extend it so as to ensnare their smaller, unregulated competitors.

Same article -

 In the end, Americans got a new federal meat inspection law, the big packers got the taxpayers to pick up the entire $3 million price tag for its implementation, as well as new regulations on the competition, and another myth entered the annals of anti-market dogma.

Same article -

 To his credit, Sinclair actually opposed the law because he saw it for what it really wasa boon for the big meat packers.

Enjoy. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I respect that opinion and think it applies to so many things in American life, but who is getting the money and how?

1. We know how we got here and who did it. It may have been a conspiracy to snag McGovern to the anti-fat side, but that seems about it. Corporations got in bed with narcissistic scientists, which gave them sway over legislators.

2. The "broken window fallacy" describes how causing an expense in one place does not simply create profit in another. If you break the baker's window, the glazier and judge get a payday but the miller and shoemaker go without. Although we live in a nation whose economic policy has been crafted by people who do not understand this phenomena at all, and sometimes applaud when nature breaks windows, I personally would not lay the blame for a bloated sector on outright government action. Rather, it is known that pharmaceutical and agricultural corporations lobby to preserve the status-quo.

IMO it isn't about keeping people working but keeping people sick. People working is a result of people being sick. A bad economist would say that keeping people working is the goal (to increase economic action) but a good economist would realize that the added expense of healthcare slows the economy and wastes people's money, forcing them to support the added expense while making them less able to do the basic productive acts at all levels of industry.

There is always going to be a fuzzy line between required expenses, subjectively desired expenses, and expenses mistakenly required. All these expenses mistakenly required by government advising an improper  diet are funds siphoned off and straight up handed to various industries: Agriculture, healthcare, diet foods, and exercise. It doesn't matter if someone has a job now because of the misallocation, they would have had a better one if the mistake had never been made. We all kinda had other plans for that money. </TEXT>

Peter Turtledove and Newt Gingrich and the Shaara family taught me that. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I got interested in all this from listening to a three-hour lecture by Mark Shepard. He specifically embraces capitalism to the extent it is the way to do business.

So here is something interesting. There is another movement: New Urbanism. But if you ask some of the more conservative people they will take the buzz word and scream AGENDA 21! AGENDA 21! So that leaves Andres Duany out of the picture. Andres, along with his wife and some others started it right out of college. But their exposure is limited. This engineer in the midwest, Chuck Marohn, gets fed up with creating bad environments and finally sees their stuff outside the left/right spectrum. He heads a group called Strong Towns. Together - and they are well known to each other - one or the other can get into any town or city in the US.

*They are both promoting the same thing.* Serving people, restoring economic rationality.

It is the same, everywhere. Even with the Papacy! Back and forth. Distributism! But property rights are central! Social Justice! But remember that social doesn't mean government. The earth has to be preserved... We want something and we all think we know how to get it... but we swim in anarchy. That is the reality. Society, markets, and the individual all interact but have different rules on the inside.

Permaculture is kinda like a ruleset for anarchy in some ways. Extremely interesting.

	<TEXT> I expect in Sweden there is a lot of literature on what to do and how to do it, along with local representatives who can help you get started. Still, I might suggest frequenting farmers markets without a CSA for a year until you get your feet under you. Sell what you end up with until you can predict what you will have.

But I know goats, not fields, so take that for as much weight as you want. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You see both sides. Catholics have contributed massively to the understanding of anarchy and objective morality.

I want more than ever to find another Catholic who wants socialism and would explain why they are allowing of government intervention, theologically.

	<TEXT> Some people would say the amount of bread in each of these is too much. The marinara sauce has a surprising amount of sugar. Being of this camp I think the balance of price, fat, and protein is good.

On the other tongue we have people who would say the fat content is not low enough. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> HA! Figured out that meatball marinara a long time ago. Makes me feel good I was right about that.

 Then I started packing sandwiches, then I got married and we bake 5 chicken breasts a week for lunches. We take it in with frozen veggies and microwave it at our offices. Less carbo - more savings. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Endgame? Ever heard of EVE Online? ;]

But seriously, I think all those things are solvable. It takes a creative bunch to manage a game by being a part of it (following the owners, like I said) but it would be interesting.

The way I see it is the objects can be given a lore of disappearing in various situations, this gives the observation team an out to make items disappear.

I see armies and chaos and lonely gods coming out of this. </TEXT>
