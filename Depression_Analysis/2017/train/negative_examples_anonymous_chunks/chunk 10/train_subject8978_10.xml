	<TEXT> Hey there, I've been working with Dave for several years and am currently helping him promote his work online:

1) You should be able to get virtually any of the phonebooks from your local comic book store. Just ask them to order them from Diamond. The first two phone books have just been remastered. The third one should be done soon. Eventually the whole series will be remastered. I don't think any of the books are currently out of print. Diamond should have some copies of each phonebook.

2) If you want to order them as PDFs, you can go to either http://sellfy.com/cerebus or to http://cerebusdownloads.com. Sellfy is a little cheaper if you share the link on twitter. The second one, "High Society" is free. Cerebusdownloads.com has PDF and CBZ. Sellfy only has PDF but CBZ coming very soon.

3) You can download them as a torrent. Sim has [expressed his understanding](http://www.cerebusdownloads.com/DaveThinking.jpg) that some people just don't have any money. The two main Cerebus torrents out there have the entire issues, so you get the letters and essays.

4) You can read it a page-a-day (approx.) on Tumblr: http://cerebusonline.tumblr.com/

5) Dave does weekly updates every Friday on youtube here: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGlbTwyt9cw4XZ9jRqrPeUg

6) Twitter with lots of cool photos here: https://twitter.com/CerebusOnline

7) Facebook group here: https://www.facebook.com/groups/cerebus/

8) Keep an eye open on eBay and Twitter for sales. People are always selling bundles of the phonebooks or individual issues for cheap.

9) Excellent Cerebus blog here: http://momentofcerebus.blogspot.com/

Hope that helps, let me know if you have any other questions! I'm running a lot of the social media side of things so am very much interested in any suggestions on getting the word out there. If anybody has any ideas or suggestions, let me know!

	<TEXT> Thanks for the reply! You make several good points, I agree on the perception of women being powerless being very dangerous. It's one of their strengths, ironically.

You probably saw the point about the Twitter case:

http://news.nationalpost.com/full-comment/christie-blatchford-ruling-in-twitter-harassment-trial-could-have-enormous-fallout-for-free-speech

That's where feminist "ideas" about free speech lead us.

"I suppose you can view human society as a system not unlike a biological system or entity..."

I think that's exactly what Dave is doing here, it's an analogy, seeing the feminist hive-mind as working collectively while men, as a rule, work individually. He's extending that analogy to the point of suggesting a hive mind. Again, it's a work of fiction. If you're at all interested in Dave Sim's work, I would recommend Tangent. I think it should be sidebarred here. I'll definitely be posting more quotes from it here in the coming months:

Thanks again! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree...but I think you're both saying the same thing, Sim's just taking artistic license with the concept because it's about a matriarchy in a magical medieval society with talking aardvarks. But I think the point of that influence being used in business, politics, the courts and schools without being acknowledged is the real problem. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ha, you're up on some stuff...I've been working with Sim for about ten years now. Currently helping him get his material online, for sale on an official site: https://sellfy.com/Cerebus and up on tumblr for free: http://cerebusonline.tumblr.com/ Just promoting his stuff on twitter, etc. Wonder what tumblr when say when we get to the 186 pages! Well, it'll be a while till that happens. But in general, I think r/TheRedPill would find a lot of what Sim says to be pretty insightful. I'm just going to post some various quotes of his to gauge the reaction. Although maybe going with "Women Read Minds, Guys" isn't the best way to approach it....still I've posted other quotes from him around here to positive response.

I think it's safe to say Dave Sim is very big on God these days, and so a fan of the Jews...and the Muslims...and the Christians. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> "All women read minds, with very few exceptions." </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-07-15 15:28:30 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> "It's a little more complicated than that. "Woman's intuition" is a nice way of putting it. "Women are more sensitive" is another way of putting it. A not-so-nice way of putting it is that women rape men's minds the way men rape women's bodies. It's not an exact analogy, of course, because rape is invasion and invasion is the man's way, not the woman's way; absorption and consumption are the woman's way; what they're built for. Consider the two genders; one that invades and violates and the other that absorbs and consumes. The nice way of putting it is that theyre complimentary. The not-so-nice way of putting it is that they deserve each other; serve each other right.

Some women are more efficient at reading minds than are others. Some only pick up impressions; they just get a "feeling" you could say. Others it's as easy as reading a book, For many of them it's like eating a piece of candy; absorbing the entirety of a mind in one gulp.

"Reading" minds isn't the worst of it. The worst of it is changing the minds they absorb; planting contrary thoughts. Changing her mind, the saying goes, is a woman's prerogative. Changing others' minds is a woman's darkest secret; the black cauldron of which we all partake. Some greedily, some guiltily. Some intentionally, some inadvertently.

What is spreading throughout the civilized world is an abomination. An abomination I was very helpful in bringing about and an abomination which can come to no good end. It is a very large and very dangerous force. Whose minds are being absorbed? Heads of state, business and economic and religious leaders. Whose minds are absorbing them? Unelected wives, grasping and opportunistic mistresses and concubines with handsome eyes and attractive figures.

Simply put, the civilized world is being subjected to mental bullying and thuggery on a monumental scale of which it is completely unaware."

Dave Sim, [Cerebus](http://i.imgur.com/aIIDecv.jpg)

----------

Just interested in hearing your thoughts on this. To make a very, very, very long story short, the above is from Dave Sim's [Cerebus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebus_the_Aardvark). Widely recognized as one of if not the most important achievement in the history of the comic book medium, Sim was vilified by the industry when he came out as an anti-feminist in 1994 with issue 186 of Cerebus.

The quote above is being told to the main character by the betrayed leader of a matriarchal movement. She was responsible for building a matriarchy but was betrayed by another woman, the story's main antagonist. This is essentially her tl;dr of how women were able to take over a (fictional) society, but I think the overall theory of women using their "intuition" as an indirect means of influencing men and that "behind the scenes" there is an absolutely monumental amount of mental bullying and thuggery that goes on between husbands and wives--including between very powerful husbands and wives--is an important insight into how the world works. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is what Hunt actually said:

Its strange that such a chauvinist monster like me has been asked to speak to women scientists. Let me tell you about my trouble with girls. Three things happen when they are in the lab: you fall in love with them, they fall in love with you, and when you criticise them they cry. Perhaps we should make separate labs for boys and girls? 

Now seriously, Im impressed by the economic development of Korea. And women scientists played, without doubt an important role in it. Science needs women and you should do science despite all the obstacles, and despite monsters like me.

That this was turned into a sexist controversy and forced a Nobel Prize winning biochemist to resign is beyond disgusting. Things are way worse than you think. Nice to see someone has the balls to stand up to this nonsense:

	<TEXT> "Journalism had been an early casualty in the war between the Female Void and the Male Light. "How do you feel?" had virtually replaced "who, what, where, when and why" as the journalistic cornerstone. "What are you feeling right now?" Every once in a great while, the Female void would run afoul of some military figure or a police captain or a fire marshal: some male who had not been devoured whole, who still had something of himself left to call his own. His answer would begin, "I think . . ." or "I believe . . ." and he would proceed to enunciate a belief, a principle, an ideal which was, to him, fundamental. The Female or Male Feminist (they differ only cosmetically from each other) interviewing him would be dogged in his or her pursuit: "But how do you feel as an individual, as a person, as a human being?" The interview subject would invariably look confused, discomfited at this. After all, he had just answered the question. He would paraphrase his belief, his principle, his ideal. "I think . . ." "I believe . . ." At this point the he/she interviewer switched, invariably, to another satellite feed: to another journalist or a psychologist or a social worker. Reasoning, Thinking Males with Systems of Belief, made for very bad television."

Paragraph 5: On one occasion, a man with deep mafia associations met then prime minister John Howard and other top Liberal Party figures at a fundraising event. It is not suggested that Mr Howard knew of the connection.

Paragraph 6: The investigation has also revealed donors have lobbied on behalf of a mafia figure to a host of Liberal and Labor MPs over issues related to their businesses. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> dr_warlock is correct:

http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2011/03/echoing-big-agribusiness-farmers-sue-monsanto/73240/

*"If you are not familiar with Percy Schmeiser vs. Monsanto and want to see how such cases play out, you owe it to yourself to spend a few minutes on http://www.percyschmeiser.com/. Schmeiser was an elderly canola farmer in Saskatchewan who for 50 years had carefully saved seeds from his own fields, replanting those that carried the specific traits he sought. He had never bought seeds from Monsanto; never even spoken to a representative of Monsanto. Somehow, his crops became contaminated by Monsanto's GM crops, either through drift from nearby fields or from the trucks loaded with GM canola seedoften without protective covers to prevent seed from blowing offspeeding along a road bordering his property. The result was that Schmeiser lost the strains of canola he had created over five decades of seed saving. Monsanto promptly sued Schmeiser, saying he owed the company over $200,000 because its patented genetic material was growing on his land. Schmeiser spent his retirement savings defending himself, but the Canadian Supreme Court ruled in Monsanto's favor, even though it did not grant the company monetary damages."* </TEXT>

Your free choice. But that is not what's happening here. People are advocating not publishing the cartoons because of what others might do. You are afraid of what they might do. This is rank cowardice of the lowest order. Freedom of expression MUST include the freedom to offend. As usual, Hitchens explains it best:

On the other hand, in 50 years there has not been one single, solitary shred of hard evidence that there was a conspiracy. But, hey, lets not let the truth get in the way of a good story.

	<TEXT> That's so naive it's almost adorable. If you think black people in the U.S. aren't faced with a racist society today, you're absurdly uneducated. Look at virtually any statistics on arrest and conviction rates on white vs. black individuals for similar crimes. Look at the incarceration rate. Black people are still largely treated like second-class citizens. Do you honestly think people get Freddie Gray-style rough rides as often in white neighborhoods? Blatant racism is a big part of America and will be for a long time. </TEXT>

Plus their movie guy loves Godard, which is cool. I think I read one New Republic story in the last ten years so can't honestly say I cared when it collapsed, yet every issue of the New Yorker has at least two or three stories I read from beginning to end.

	<TEXT> Sort of. There is a very big difference between Malcolm X while he was in the NOI, when he basically just repeated what he was taught by Elijah Muhammad, and after he left (was forced out of) the NOI in early 1964. After he left he embraced a much more inclusive philosophy, rejected racism, rejected the NOI, embraced traditional Islam and fought for the human rights of all people regardless of color. However, he never rejected the philosophy of self-defense or his militancy. I VERY highly recommend this 1972 documentary, consisting almost entirely of footage of Malcolm X, which shows the evolution of his thought.

	<TEXT> He was a good shot.

"Just three weeks after joining the Marines, hes trained in the use of an M-l rifle. He shoots on a rifle range [a score of] 212, which means he qualified for the second-highest position in the Marine Corps, that of a sharpshooter.

Near the end of his stay in the Marines in 1959, after being court-martialed twice and his morale was low, he went back to re-qualify himself in the range  still shot a 191, and still qualified as a marksman. That meant that he could hit a 10-inch target eight times out of ten from 200 yards away."
