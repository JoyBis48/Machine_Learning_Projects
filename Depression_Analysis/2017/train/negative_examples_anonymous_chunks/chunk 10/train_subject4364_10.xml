	<TEXT> Great article! I always wonder when I should put more weight on value or mana cost in arena, and it really sums it up quite well. 

Never thought about drafting a more flat and value-based curve early in order to fit more curved-out yet quality cards. Thanks for the read. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hmm... I did see him play 2 imp gang bosses and assorted 2-drops which led me to believe he was drafting a more zooish-aggro style deck, but I just consider the likelihood of both drafting and drawing voidcaller coupled with a considerable demon drop to be too low to play around. Just too much effort goes into letting the warlock keep a 3/4 to trade up or get value out of, but you do make a good point in reading your opponent, will consider it next time I approach a voidcaller. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, I feel with the entire randomness with arena what first drafting voidcaller and a big drop demon and having drawn both of them make these kinds of situations unlikely, but they do happen :/

Thanks for the input, probably will try to commit to board with no fear next time </TEXT>

	<TITLE> In arena, should you ever proc a Voidcaller deathrattle? If so, when? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> So in context, I was maintaining pretty good board presence (water ele + haunted creeper) as mage until the warlock decides to drop a voidcaller turn 5. My typical midrange-controllish mage mindset tells me to clear it, and when I do, I get punished by the Dread Infernal that pops out.

How can I avoid these kinds of situations besides the obvious silence or poly/hex? </TEXT>
