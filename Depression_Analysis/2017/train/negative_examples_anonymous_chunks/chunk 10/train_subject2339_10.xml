	<TEXT> The point is not to bring those resources back to the surface of earth, but to leave them in orbit.  A huge cost in space, is just getting things from the surface of earth to orbit.

A great example is water. Water on earth is pretty cheap, you would think what is the point of mining an astroid for water it is so cheap already. The thing is, water is really heavy, and and just taking one gallon of it to space can cost tens of thousands of dollars. So if you could produce water in orbit for say 1000 dollars a gallon. that price would be ridiculous on earth, but in space you would actually be 10 times cheaper than the price of launched water.

Water can be used for tons of stuff, like obvious stuff like supporting humans, but also separating it into hydrogen and oxygen to make rocket fuel, fuel cells, oxygen for human, and much more. </TEXT>

The whole point of mining an astroid and making stuff out of it in space is because it is really expensive to launch it off the earth.  the point would not be to bring those resources back to earth, but to refine the materials and use them to build stuff in orbit.

	<TEXT> Sorry I did not realize I was talking to a new person lol.  Yea i feel like the problem with continuing sanction on Iran is it has the potential to turn the younger Iranian generation against us where right now they are pretty supportive of western culture.  

The last thing we need to do is make ourselves new enemy in the middle east. and by continuing sanctions it would play right into the propaganda of the Iranian government. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> But what is the point of keeping them in sanctions indefinitely?  

The idea with sanctions is that you are incentivizing them to do something, in this case it was to come to the negotiating table.  Sanctions only work so long as everyone is in on them, and most other nations in the world are willing to make a deal now that Iran is ready.  

I think if you were to attempt to continue to sanction Iran, it would turn out like the Cuban Embargo where pretty much every other nation in the world has normal relations except the US. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Having illegals certainly won't increase the crime rate! It's a crime to even be here. If you think illegals keep the crime rate down because of all the vigilante-like crime reporting they're doing then I'd love to see that source.

That is exactly what I am saying.  There have been many recent studies showing that immigrant communities actually have significantly lower crime rates than other comparable communities.

* http://www.livescience.com/4872-immigration-reduces-crime-rates.html
* http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Charis_Kubrin/publication/227690045_THE_POWER_OF_PLACE_Immigrant_Communities_and_Adolescent_Violence/links/00b4952bd08cf4ae70000000.pdf

In the US there is the ongoing misconception that just because someone decided to move travel from one piece of land to another, they are suddenly dangerous criminals.  Merely stepping form [one side of an invisible line to another](http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1432/5101130350_5889fd728d_b.jpg) makes you a dangerous criminal. We make the laws and just because it is a law does not mean that it is justified or equal to other laws.  Imagine if we made it illegal for the people living in South Carolina to go to North Carolina.  People would still do it, does that make them the same as murderers?  I would say no, and statistics would say the same thing.  

Ps: One thing that I found especially interesting about those studies is that the statistics seem to show that it is actually 2nd and 3rd generation immigrants that tend to commit more crime, not the 1st generation. So if you are part of a latino gang or something like that, it is very likely that you are actually an american citizen.

	<TEXT> I think you mean 1 million total.  I think that we should redesign the way we do immigration in the US.  The problem with our immigration system is we allow the same number of immigrants from every country in the world.  So we allow the same amount of immigrants from Iceland as we do from China.  I think a simple fix that would help would be to make it based on population so larger countries get more Visas, and smaller ones get less. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If whitey came over from Europe, do you think they would show up with less than an 8th grade education?

But then again "whitey" from Europe would probably not be willing to pick lettuce 12 hours a day for 4 dollars an hour.  People do not realize that our economy and many businesses benefit enormously from having illegal immigrants working here providing incredibly cheap labor.  

How many people should be able to come into the US?

I think that immigrants from latin america should be treated similarly to immigrants from other countries.  I do not know how many should be allowed to come to the US, but I definitely think it should be more than what we are allowing now.  

I have personally experienced the impunity of our immigration system.   I have a friend from Mexico that was trying to get a tourist visa so she could come to the US and visit.  But because her visa was denied. If she had been from Canada she would be here, but for the sole reason that she was born in Mexico suddenly she is treated like a criminal. </TEXT>

Here is a source I can find more if you would like.  If you look you will see every major city in the US is on that list of cities that have this policy.  I was slightly mistaken, the police have a policy of not inquiring into your legal status when they are patrolling and such, it seems that once you are arrested the policy is still to turn you over to immigration.

In what world do you live in that you want people illegally invading our country?

Can we keep the personal attacks to a minimum.  Stop putting words in my mouth.  I said nothing about allowing illegal immigrants to invade our country.  Where did you think that I said that?  What I did say is that i support this policy that cities have.  I would rather my city cut its murder and violent crime rate in half than have the police focus on finding illegal immigrants that are minding their own business and not committing crime.  The illegal immigrant in San Francisco was a mistake, and by no means the norm.  Like I said the policy does not prevent you from being arrested and charged with a crime its not a get out of jail free card, it is just a policy that police will not inquire into your legal status if they are responding to your report of a crime or find you walking down the street. 

I would like to ask you now what makes people from Latin America so horrible?  We get immigrants from all over the world, illegal and legal, what makes Latino's so horrible? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Like I said immigrants are coming here no matter what, you can't seal off a country it is impossible to do.  You forget that more people coming into the US legally will mean more money being spent more tax revenues, and more revenues for businesses which, you guessed it, means businesses can hire more people.

I think the core of what I was saying above, is not about letting any body and their friend come into the US, but opening up the system so that the people that already come here can do so legally.  Businesses make a ton of money by being able to hire workers for very low rates, and not pay taxes on that labor.  If those workers started making more money, it could mean more money being spent at local businesses and more money being spent in general, because low income people spend way more of their income than rich people do.

I think you also need to ask yourself if we were getting big influx of people of people from countries like the UK, France, and Germany and western Europe to work here in the US would you care as much?   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have a feeling this was not an accident by the Republicans.  They seem to have been doing this more and more lately, where behind closed doors they agree on a way where they can vote one way and get the opposite.  Nobody in their constituency cares about how they voted 6 months ago.  But when they all vote no and Obama overrides them, they can call Obama a dictator monarch president and talk about how he is taking over america and trying to ruin the country.

It seems like even Fox should be able to ask the simple question of if you really did not want this Iran deal, why did you vote for a bill that you fully knew would allow an Iran deal to happen.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ok while conservatives have spun the city sanctuary thing as some liberal scandal, it is actually common practice for most large cities, and it makes a lot of sense.

The whole reasoning behind local authorities officially not turning over illegal immigrants to immigration is to fight crime.  Cities were having huge problems with crime because illegal immigrants were afraid to call the cops when crime was happening for the rightful fear that they would be deported.  So most cities began making it official that they would not turn over illegal immigrants to immigration in order to incentivize them to repot crimes.  For the most part it has proven to be very successful with large drops in crime.   

What these laws/policies do not do, and what conservative media fails to mention, is they do not protect criminals.  If the police find that you are a criminal they will arrest you, and if you are an illegal immigrant they will turn you over to immigration.

	<TEXT> First of all we do not allow "endless, unchecked, unregulated immigration"  Compared to many other countries our laws are actually quite strict.  What is quite obvious though is that even with these laws people are still coming here because of the economic opportunities available.  When you can make 10 times as much doing the same work you would do back in your home country it makes a lot of sense to come to the US.

Opening up our immigration system would help a great deal, because we could make a lot more of the immigrants who are going to come in anyway, legal immigrants.  This would allow us to 

* tax them properly, 
* prevent them from undercutting wages in the market
* make it easier to track criminals

Those were just the things I could think of off the top of my head.

Edit: spelling/grammar </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Is NH simply taking pictures/doing a little science before spending the last of its days hurdling towards interstellar space?

Pretty much. 

If New horizons wanted to enter into orbit around Pluto, it would have had to go on a much larger rocket, likely go much slower, and would have had to carry much more fuel.

This is not really that unusual, I believe most if not all of our other first times visiting planets were flyby missions. In fact Voyager 2 is the only probe we have sent to Uranus or Neptune.  It did a flyby of those two planets in 1985 and 1989 respectively as well as Jupiter and Saturn, and is now flying into deep space.

In general For the purposes of first time encounters, especially to a planet this far away, a flyby mission makes a lot more sense, mainly because it is 

* Faster, it takes much less time to get somewhere when you don't have to slow down.  
* Simplicity, you do not need to know that much about another place to just flyby it, whereas entering into orbit requires you to have a much better understanding of the system you are trying to enter into orbit around,  A great example is until only a few months ago we did not know about Pluto's 3 other moons.  If this is your first time going to a place, you probably do not know what instruments to take either.  It would be a shame to spend a whole bunch of money to take a bunch of optical instruments to Venus when all you are going to get is some pictures of clouds.  If you are going there you probably want to use radar and such so you can see the surface below the clouds.

* Finally cost.  All of these things add up to a much lower cost, for the mission and a much easier sell to the higher ups paying for your mission, which makes sense when you have no idea what you are going to see when you get there.

Make no mistake though, we are going to get a ton of science from this mission.  In the AMA today The scientists talked about how it is going to take [16 months to download it all](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3d9luh/were_scientists_on_the_nasa_new_horizons_team/ct3272a?context=3). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think you mean .2 mph/h (miles per hour/per hour) this is because acceleration is a measure of the change in velocity.  MPH is a measure of velocity.  If you need more clarification on that, just ask.  

To your main question.  I am not sure if it is .2 MPH/H but New Horizons is decelerating.  The reason New horizons is slowing down, is because of the Suns gravity.  As New Horizons moves away from the Sun, it slows down, for the same reason that when you throw a ball strait up in the air it slows down.  The main difference is that New Horizons is moving fast enough that it will never fall back to the Sun it will just slow down over time.

Does that make sense? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was reading about the Atlas V recently and realized that in a few of its configurations it only has 1 solid rocket booster.  One of those configurations has been launched 3 times.

The configuration can be really well seen in this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dME5amgp0Ug

My question is how is the vehicle able to deal with the loading, because it is quite obvious the rocket seems to be flying slightly sideways to compensate for the off center thrust.

How is the rocket able to fly like this?  It's so odd to see a non symmetrical rocket design.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There is a difference between punishing them, and handicapping them.  How would you feel if for every person we sent to jail we cut off a their foot.  The worse the crime the more you loose, so shoplifting it a toe, grand theft auto is your foot, and murder is leg below the knee.  If you proposed this people would say this is horrible.  People would be unable to care for themselves once they leave prison.  What people do not recognize is this is what we already do this to people mentally.  When you treat a person like an animal and don't give them the chance to better themselves, than they are going to turn into an animal.  Are prisons these days are the breeding ground for even worse criminals, and even if you do get out we make life so hard for you once you get out that it is likely that you will be forced to return soon.  We are basically cutting their leg off as "punishment" and then blame then when they can't contribute to society when they get out of prison.  So we should ask ourselves is it worth it to "punish" these people with the enormous amount it costs us both monetary and soacially to everyone else. </TEXT>
