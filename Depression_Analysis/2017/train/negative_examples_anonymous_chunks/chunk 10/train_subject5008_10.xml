	<TEXT> and if you're a male......you don't really want to deal with women that feel this way because they are flaky and irrational. We're not talking about an isolated area here.....going to the coffee shop with a stranger is something you probably do every day already. Had a much better time on dates with girls who were willing to show up with minimal BS. Been dating one for nearly 3 years. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Who said fuck about a relationship? A date. Any reasonably attractive woman will have orders of magnitude more messages online than an equally attractive male, even in Boston. Also...why does college/post-grad matter? Maybe someone is being too choosy. There are supposedly 1.09 single women per 1 single man in Boston....hardly an overwhelming ratio. Go into virtually any bar this weekend and you'll see guys taking on much worse odds.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm going to be very blunt. If you are female and have failed at online dating you're probably not that attractive. Sorry, truth hurts, work on improving attractiveness.

If you're male and have failed at online dating, you may be unattractive OR you're doing it wrong. Don't chat with women. Exchange one message and then start pushing to meet in person. If they "want to chat to get to know you" DO NOT waste your time. There is an inverse relationship between the number of pre-date messages and your chance of sex. Also, try to go after women that aren't originally from the Boston area. Much more likely to be friendly and not crazy. </TEXT>
