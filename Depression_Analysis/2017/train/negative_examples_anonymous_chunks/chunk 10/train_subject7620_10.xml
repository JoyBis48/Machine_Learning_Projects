	<TEXT> Shuns paring knife is very highly rated among pro chefs,good choice.For a chef knife however i would suggest something like this for someone new to Japanese knives http://www.chefknivestogo.com/fu18gy.html . This will save you some  money and hold an edge better than a German knife while being less prone to chipping or tip breaking while you get used to the thin blade and steep edge bevels of these knives. Use the Germans as the work -horses and the gyuto for things like slicing and dicing softer veggies and boneless meats. Warning: the first time you slice a ripe tomato and don't see any juice on your board, you may fall in love with these knives. One last thing,learn how to strop,you won't be sorry.

	<TEXT> Not to much actually, the big one was $35 and the little one was around $80. To be honest I haven't done any serious sharpening with these,I just play around stropping on them for edge upkeep and they do fine with that although the course one won't cut the super steels very well,(vg10,R2). I guess the trick to nats is to keep the slurry washed off until you get the edge and and then let it build up and thicken as you keep working with less and less pressure, that way one stone is multi grit. One day i will find the patience to try this. For actual sharpening I have a couple Shapton bench stones and an edge- pro, easy peasy quick and easy. Got the nats from CKTG and at those prices I'm sure they are not top of the line,but it's a start. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Correct on all counts. Stones are J-nats that I got from CKTG. Naturals are usually hideously expensive but these two plus the nagura came to just over $100,not bad. The large one is low grit and the small one is a very hard high grit finisher. I figured that if I'm going to learn free hand sharpening I might as well start the old fashioned way. </TEXT>
