	<TEXT> I think that you're getting down votes because you're not arguing the same point as /u/Cookiesandcardio, i.e., your comment is essentially a non-sequitur. /u/Cookiesandcardio indicated pit bulls have a "great potential **for destruction**" [emphasis added] and that "all breeds have the potential." You indicated that their comment "is simply not true" but then later clarified that it's not true that all breeds have the "ability to kill you." So, the disconnect is that "potential for destruction"  "ability to kill you". I believe that /u/Cookiesandcardio's statement is true that all breeds have the potential for destruction  a quick Internet search indicates that even [wienerdogs have been known to seriously injure small children](http://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/2002/12/27/dachshund-put-to-death-after-mauling-md-baby/d05a3d2a-f857-4c1a-8f6e-c0156477c548/). I also believe that your statement is true that not all breeds have the potential to kill you, e.g., [there is no record of a Dachshund having killed anyone in the last 30+ years](http://www.dogsbite.org/pdf/dog-attack-deaths-maimings-merritt-clifton-2014.pdf). The problem is that your statement doesn't directly contradict that of /u/Cookiesandcardio. </TEXT>
