	<TITLE> My ex was diagnosed with cancer 2 years ago and is now suffering from depression. She does not have anybody and I am trying to learn how to effectively support her. I would really appreciate some advice. </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I will try to keep it short:

We started dating in Jan 2013, she was diagnosed in August 2013 (she cannot be cured, but it is currently under control. Nobody knows for how long though). 
We stayed together until April this year. We had lots of ups and downs. However until now she always managed to pick herself back up. 

I don't want to go into why we broke up because my version of the story is of course biased. In any case, we did not work. By the end of our relationship we argued 24/7. 

She decided that she does not want to talk to me anymore. I did not like that but had to respect her wish. Yesterday she called me and was saying that she can't bear it anymore (the pressure, the emotional pain, being alone). The few friends she has do listen to her, but there is no solution to ease the emotional pain she is in. She keeps saying things that make me believe she might be about to harm herself. Also she has no family she can rely on. 

I want to help her, but I must know what the best way is to deal with depression. How can I make life seem worth living to her? 

Any advice on how to support her would be greatly appreciated. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I firmly believe that the concept of duty is bullshit. 

Why does a soldier have to feel a sense of duty? It is a job. He is risking his life so pay him a lot. Don't tell him: Hey look, we can't pay you very well, but it's an honour to fight for your country, so you've got that going for you."

If a worker is supposed to work better, more efficient, etc, increase his compensation. What is wrong with that?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I can't believe water desalination is still difficult (or expensive). Of course I know nothing about it, but here is what I think:

In places where water is scarce, it's normally hot, so boiling water does not require soooooo much energy. I am sure you can build a few of them plants for a few million Dollars and build pipelines.

Who's gonna pay for it? Just ask some rich dudes if they want to be loved by a whole continent for 20% of their money. If I had the money, I would totally give.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, I went through the following procedure because I did it all as it happened. I am sure by now you can skip half the steps

1. http://forum.xda-developers.com/z3-compact/development/stock-firmware-23-0-1-5-77-generic-t3012378

2. Flashed the first available Lollipop rom as soon as it was available pre rooted. I had to reinstall custom recovery though.

3. then I flashed this: http://forum.xda-developers.com/z3-compact/development/d5803-lollipop-5-02-odexed-pre-rooted-2-t3090505. When you do this, make sure to flash the dualrecovery after flashing the rom. Otherwise you lose the custom recovery again. 

I am sure this is nowhere near a good enough step by step guide. But you can find everything you need on XDA.

Edit: This is a good guide. http://forum.xda-developers.com/z3-compact/general/how-to-root-backup-drm-keys-t3013343

Again, something easier might be available by now.

So far everything is perfect. Xposed works, I've got viper4android working. I'm super happy. 

Well actually I've got two problems:

1. Sometimes apps just force stop. But it's rare and really doesn't bother me. 

2. Very often the screen turns on in my pocket and changes settings, pocketdials, or does something else. But that is not a lollipop issue. That is a it's too hot and me legs are sweaty issue.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A Stargate address is a coordinate system used by a Stargate to determine the position of a target gate in the Stargate Network. They are composed of a series of glyphs, at least seven depending on the intended destination, which when entered in the correct order allow the Stargate to establish a wormhole with another gate at the destination.

He was fucked in the head. He never got over the hunger he experienced in prison so he would never share food and he would always have tons of food in the freezer. He didn't sleep well and never talked about it. He beat his wife and children. 

He received a pension but that is it. No mental support, no therapy. Nobody thanked him or was proud of him. Nobody gave a shit basically. And to this day when people talk about him, nobody gives a shit that he was sent to fight </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Here are the translated lyrics

[Part 1]

My biceps shall burn

Instead of always running away from me

I want to aim at the target

And since then I am only working out

***[Hook]***

This is a current trend

Even more than the Advent

This is THE event

My biceps burns

I am a workout talent

doing the experiment

permanently

My biceps burns

***[Part 2]***

I had almost given up

I was thinking

Throw what I carry with me (makes no sense)

All gone, the baggage, the Sixpack

I'm always pumping

My mama already thought

I had gone to the brothel with Armin

***[Hook] again***

***[Outro]***

My biceps burns

My biceps burns

Workout Talent

My biceps burns

Following the trend

My biceps burns

permanently

My biceps burns

	<TEXT> Fair enough. I get your point and I don't think you are wrong. I understand that many people rely on artists like Swift to make a living. I also have no numbers that show Apple provides more welfare than Swift's label. 

I simply think that (even though I really dislike Apple) if Apple manages to provide a service that many people will use (iOS and Android) that will further limit piracy and will be providing better/similar performance and user experience that current offers (like Spotify) provide and if to do that and to penetrate the marker they regard it as necessary to offer 3 months free trial, then Swift should stop complaining that she is not getting paid for 3 months.

	<TEXT> What I mean is she said artists don't get paid. There is no information about whether or not the labels won't make any money. It actually says that the labels expect a positive long term effect. The people are not employed by swift, but by the label. So her not getting the money should be acceptable if the apple secures jobs and the labels expect it to pay off in the long run. 

I hope this is understandable. I can't put it any better.  </TEXT>

It's all good that America is the greatest country on Earth but this is unacceptable.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The only thing the bothers me about what she is saying is this:

 Swift hints that Apple can easily afford to eat the costs of paying out to labels during that period

Yes, they can, but so can she. The only difference is that Apple is a company that provides jobs for many people and therefore I'd rather they have the money and pay their people well. 

I don't think there is any problem with Taylor not getting the money for three month. This is not even considering that if she does not put her music on there, she also doesn't get any money.

	<TEXT> I totally get where your question is going. 

All the answers make sense and try to show you a way to get out of an awkward situation. 

However I would like to recommend something else. 

If somebody has a certain budget and wants to spend that, that's fine. To that person it won't matter if they can get the same quality (considering their level of skill) as with one that is below their budget. So if you actually have the knowledge, recommend a camera that is good and is within their budget. Who are you to say that their pictures will turn out like shit and they don't have the potential to actually make use of the camera.

Now the important part is manage expectations. Try before buy is the motto. Who buys an expensive camera before taking it for a spin? If you have the time, let them take a few pictures with your camera. They'll see what they look like. If you don't have the time, tell them to ask in the store. Of course you should tell them why they should try the camera first and see what pictures they end up with. 

But you shouldn't feel bad and it should not be an awkward situation. If you recommend something and they are too lazy to try it first: their fault. They don't have to follow your advice. 

And for the guy who complained after: why don't you show him the kind of picture you can take with it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So, I had the same problem. 

I bought a cable though, no adapter. 

I bought [this](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00EI41K26?psc=1 redirect=true ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00) cable and had the exact same problem. Would not detect the cable and I did not see anything. The cable has many good reviews so I guess I just got unlucky. 

Then I bought [this](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00965EMF4?psc=1 redirect=true ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s01) and I am super happy with it. 

What I am trying to say is: Maybe your surface is faulty or settings need to be changed. But chances are you got a shitty adapter. I tried a different cable and that worked for me.
