	<TEXT> I legit am telling you the truth with this story:
Once when I had never cooked anything besides microwave popcorn and toast, my gf and I had a craving for mozerella cheese sticks. Instead of going out, we decided to try to make them.  We filled up a pot of oil and put it on the stove to boil.  Then we lifted the lid and it shoots up in flames!  Now we should have just put the lid back on and removed it from the heat, but instead we did this: We called the fire department and ran outside.

Now the fire department can and a fireman went into the kitchen while we watched through the window.  This is what we saw him do: He picked up the flaming pot of oil and brought it over to the sink and turned the faucet on.  It was like this gif.  Fortunately the fireman was wearing a protective suit, but the ceiling was toasted.  Suffice to say, my gf did not get her deposit back  for the apartment.

I was pretty shocked to see this, because I really thought this would be the first thing they teach you NOT to do in firefighter school. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You being downvoted shows the ignorance of the average reader here.  Of course it is the CONTENT of the food.  Nutrition is really important for weight loss and overall good health.  Not all calories are equal.  If you eat buttloads of sugar you aren't getting any nutrition and you will still be hungry and will eat more food.  If you eat a well-balanced wholesome meal you will feel satiated for longer. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  There is no way chicken will magically make you lose more weight than a well-planned plant based diet, especially not if you do not exercise.

That's true, and I was never arguing otherwise.  But she is acting on the advice of her doctor, however wrong that advice is. The language of "betrayal" also implies that eating vegan is some kind of team, or worse, a religion where we try to win "converts". We shouldn't be so emotionally invested in our dietary choices that we feel personally attacked when someone decides to try something else. </TEXT>

Your wife isn't betraying you, she's just responding the circumstances in her life (however misguided her reasoning may be).  Have you talked to her about other strategies for reducing her carb intake WITHOUT reverting to animal consumption?  You and your wife should be on the same team here, and that team's goal is for you both to have good health.  Also, maybe she needs a better doctor. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have read much of the Hebrew Bible.  Yes, there are some thing that sound fucked up in there, but most people do not take them literally.  There are many ways to interpret these texts.  Most jews that I know practice peace, charity, and [Tikkun olam](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tikkun_olam) (the practice of "reparing the world") .  Judaism is one of the least understood religions, because they don't make any effort to proselytize, and they only bother to explain things to people who ask.  Because of this, people have been misinterpreting the religion for centuries.

[Here are some awesome jews who are wholly against Zionism](http://www.truetorahjews.org/).  Remember, the first Zionists where all secular and didn't make any sort of religious claims.  Some Zionists have tried to use religious arguments to manipulate religious jews into supporting their cause.  They have deliberately conflated Zionism and Judaism. Please don't do the same thing.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Seeking a permaculture internship on the West Coast </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-11-29 22:50:30 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> My vision is to join or start a self-sufficient community designed around the principals of permaculture, such as diversity, integration, creative response to change, etc.  I practice yoga and meditation almost everyday to aid in my personal transformation.  I'm skilled at organizing people, inspiring others, and conveying a vision.

What I am lacking are some practical skills for operating a self-sufficient community.  Particularly, I'm looking for hands on experience with designing and setting up a sustainable permaculture food garden/farm/forest.  My ideal situation would be to live and work on an operating or developing farm for several months, with some formal lessons to lay a foundation of understanding.  I do not have thousands of dollars to spend and I'm hoping for a work/study arrangement.

Please, if you know of a place like this, ideally in CA, OR, or WA, let me know!  This is not a passing whim, but something I see as integral to my life's/soul's progression.

Also, what actions can I be taking right now to prepare myself for something like this?  Thank you!! </TEXT>

But while we are at it, IMHO, if drugs were dealt with in a sensible manner, dealers wouldn't be severely penalized either unless they were pushing to kids or engaged in violent behaviour.  It's a transaction between consenting adults about what to put in their own bodies.  Why don't we throw all the pharmaceutical pushers in jail?  These are actually the most abused drugs. </TEXT>

1. Realize that only you can make yourself happy.  Stop looking outside of yourself for that perfect person/job/situation to change your life.
2. Meditate. Learn to quiet your mind and get in touch with your truest self.
3. Exercise everyday.  Get addicted to endorphins.  A healthy mind follows a healthy body.
4. Make lists of things you are grateful for.  Use these things to cultivate a feeling of well-being and practice holding this feeling for as long as possible each day.
5. Aim to please yourself, not other people. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was taking this from the article:

 If youre a little hazy on the meaning, it means to inhale and exhale the vapor produced by an electronic cigarette device, which are themselves also sometimes known as vapes. The word was coined as a way of distancing the act of e-smoking from the act of smoking combustible tobacco cigarettes, the OED said in a statement today.

But from the [OED's blog](http://blog.oxforddictionaries.com/press-releases/vape-named-oxford-dictionaries-word-year-2014/):
*vape*, verb
Inhale and exhale the vapour produced by an electronic cigarette or similar device

*vape*, noun
 An electronic cigarette or similar device; an act of inhaling and exhaling the vapour produced by an electronic cigarette or similar device

At least it does say "or similar device" *cough cough* cannabis vaporizer. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> this is probably true, but still the definition is somewhat incomplete. I have been using the word to refer to vaporizing cannabis for years and I'm sure others do as well. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  To force companies to include certain messages, knowing full well that people have an irrational fear of the thing these messages are informing of is a blatant violation of companies right to commercial free speech.

The purpose of labels is to educate.  Laws shouldn't be made based on assumptions of how people will react to education.  This line of thinking is directly from the industry.  They are afraid of losing business because of people "irrational" fear of GMOs, but whether or not those fears are irrational is irrelevant.  If industry is so proud of their product it is there job to present their side to consumers.  It is consumers' right to do their own research and come to their own conclusions.  Without labels people cannot make informed decisions about what to buy and what industry practices they want to support.  I'm sure there are many people who think GMOs are the best thing since sliced bread and will buy them specifically because they are GM.  This is their right as well.

Now, exactly what constitution statute are you referring to?  You can't possibly be suggesting that it's a 1st amendment violation.  That is really laughable.  Denying people access to information is protecting "free speech"?  Be honest, that argument is spurious at best. </TEXT>
