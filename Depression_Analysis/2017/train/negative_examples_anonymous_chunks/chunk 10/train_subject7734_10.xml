	<TEXT> man, I'm almost 3 minutes into it and I haven't even cracked a smile. What is the joke about being a kid and playing a song on a jukebox for hours on end is funny...besides the fact that it's kind of funny when you're a kid? 

I digress. Why are people laughing when he says that a small town restaurant is home to kids and (transients or something)? I must have missed that part of life. I'm from a small town but...still.

I understand everyone has their own taste and I suppose mine is completely different but I am still amazed that this is the top performance on this thread. I'm seriously questioning my humor.

I mean, shouldn't Kevin Harts Long Dick at least be above this? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> If anyone is looking for something to do thids Friday, Saturday or Sunday there is a huge gathering of fife and drum corps in Deep River. It's called the muster and for those of you who don't know what it is and need something to do, read on. </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Every year people from all around the world congregate upon the small town of Deep River to play, parade, and get publicly drunk. Largest gathering of it's kind in the world at least at one point...maybe still.

Tonight is the tattoo which is just a jam session on Devitt field and usually the most drunk night of the weekend. It goes until 2 am (so you still have time) but there is a camp and generally the town is cool with people partying all around until whenever. 

Tomorrow is when the parade is and the numbers really show up. It begins at 11 am. Then the rest of the day and  throughout the night again until 2 AM it rages on. 

Sunday usually has another jam session in the early part of the day and putters out in the afternoon. I won't be making it this year but I thought I would send the word out to you all if your looking for something unique to check out. 

If you do make it to the parade tomorrow be sure to look out for the Ancient Mariners. They have a guy chained up who they drag along as they drink heavily, beat the guy up, and shoot off cannons.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm using a Griffin to go into my ipad. My electric guitar has been working just fine for months. I bought an acoustic pick up for my nylon. I got it all set, plugged her in and when I try to go to turn the monitor on it doesnt seem to recognize it...sort of.
I can see the light turn green so it's getting a signal but I dont have the option to turn the monitor on like when I use my electric. It is just giving me the option to use in interapp device.
anyone know whats going on?

I have also posted this in ipadmusic but thought I would check here as well. 

Thanks

	<TEXT> If you happen to have netflix can you go to season 1 episode 6 at about 29:00 and do you know who it is? It definitely has an Irish feel with the fiddle etc but the rhythm not so much. I've noticed that all episodes dont seem to list these songs. Maybe it's just a composer who does filler songs for the show I dont know.  </TEXT>
