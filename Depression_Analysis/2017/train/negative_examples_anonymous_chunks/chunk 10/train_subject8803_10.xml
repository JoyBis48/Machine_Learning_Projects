	<TEXT> Completely agreed although i think that the feedback of the driver i a massive factor in the development. He can feel hoe the car reacts to updates/ changes. Telemetry doesnt always show that. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Probaly the smart desicion. Alonso en Jenson are perfect to develop a car. I guess they target wcc/wdc in 2017 with Alonso and Vandoorne/kmag.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, i think he did. Thats why they went looking for it and found the problem. Ofc he doesnt know excactly what the problem was but i think no one wouls.  The point is he noticed it first in Q1 and there was really no time to fix it in qualy so he just set out to do the best lap he could do and get it sorted after. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Lots of people are missing the point. Yes Sainz is more consistent and quicker in qualifying, but he hasn't raised my heartbeat once so far this season. Max just is an exciting driver to watch. That's what this article is about.

The No.1 complaint is that f1 is getting boring, more exciting drivers means less boring races. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> but this "speeding under the safety car" rule is measured by lap/sector time right? so he could go fast for 200m and back off again after that i think.. Anyway, it looked pretty quick right at turn 1. </TEXT>
