	<TEXT> You know, it's funny you should mention silver bullets. Before he passed out, T kept saying,"I swear to god, it was a skinwalker..."

Now, I laughed at him, but I heard it too. It did sound like it teleported from the neighbors shed to the side of my house. But, like I wrote, it sounded a bit lower in pitch, making me and G pretty sure, there were at least 2. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Before it got dark today I did just that. I was looking for tracks beside the house. I didn't see any. I also checked around the shed. Behind it is a lot of, well, trash and crap. I didn't see any tracks but it did appear some things had been moved and there was a spot by the corner of the shed (whereabouts we heard it growl/howl both nights) that seemed the grass and weeds were pressed down. Like something had been sitting or standing there. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It started a few weeks ago, my boyfriend was going to his car. He did a visible double-take and said he thought he saw something next to his car, slouching. I asked him if he thought it was a neighborhood dog, he said it was way too big. He and I looked around, but saw nothing.

Flash forward to this past Friday. My boyfriend, his stepbrother, and I were sitting on the back porch, talking and trying to build a fire in the fire pit. We heard this loud, high pitched sound coming from the tall weeds behind where the cars are parked. It sounded large and aggressive. His stepbrother and I had never heard this sound before and we were taken aback. My boyfriend, however, stopped talking and said,"Holy shit! I swear to god, I heard that same animal the other morning when I got home from work, only it was a deeper sound and it sounded like it was in mourning. It was really sad to listen to, it sounded so sad." Immediately, I wanted to go inside. Whatever it was sounded pretty close and pretty big. It didn't sound exactly nice, either. But, being as men are, my boyfriend and his stepbrother got out a super bright flashlight and laser lights and started to aim it right where we'd heard the cry. After a few minutes of this, I went inside and watched through the glass door, the guys seemed alright and the light show devolved into a bit of fun as they shined the green and blue lasers on the shed behind the house and I figured we were alright, so I went back outside. We resumed sitting on the porch and I had the cat, Tiny, in my lap. He was almost passed out, purring and snuggling with me. We had pretty much all but forgotten the noise earlier and had given up on the fire. It was maybe 20 minutes later when we heard the cry again, this time it was much closer, behind the shed, maybe 40ft from us. Tiny shot out of my lap and ran, somewhere, it's hard to say because my boyfriend, his stepbrother, and I were like a shot, too. We ran for the back door like our lives depended on it. "Whoa, what the fuck was that!?," I said. My boyfriend just kept saying, "it was over behind the shed, wtf?!" His stepbrother was white as a sheet. We were pretty freaking spooked. I know I have never heard anything like that, ever. I couldn't place what I'd heard to any animal I've ever heard. We went into the living room, turned on the tv, and decided to sit in. We heard some sounds like heavy steps on the back porch, my boyfriend swears he heard the sound again, but he thought it was by or on the back porch.

Then came Sunday. My roommate came home from a business trip, and we were sitting on the back porch, just talking about life. We both stopped when we heard a sound from the foresty area behind the house, beyond the field. He looked up and said,"What was that? I've never heard that before." (He's lived here 15 years, btw.) A few minutes later he and I went in. He had work in the morning and had to be up and out by 5:30am, so we said our goodnights, and I went to bed.

Monday. It started out like a very nice day. I went with my boyfriend to my parents, my aunt was visiting from Virginia with her three boys and my boyfriend had to leave for work around 9:45pm. We said our goodbyes and it had been decided my brothers would give me a ride home. We left around midnight and the instructions from my dad were they were to drop me off and go straight home. We should have listened. But, being as family is, my brothers wanted to hang out for a bit. We went inside to get refreshments, and I went outside real quick to light the lantern. I went back in for a second to tell them we should sit outside, it was cool out and a clear night. We walked outside and I saw the lantern was out, there was almost no wind. "Weird, that thing has a big wick, maybe it's out of fluid?" I relit the latern, it burned bright, it wasn't out of fluid. We all sat down and played with Tiny, talked about what we were up to, video games, etc. That's when I heard it. It was far off, by the foresty area. It sounded like a deep, long howl. It almost sounded aggressive. I immediately recognized it from the other night. I said,"Did you hear that?" My brother (we'll call him T) said,"Yeah, I heard that. I wasn't going to say anything, but I did. It sounded, like a dog, but not a dog." My other brother (we'll call him G) said he hadn't heard anything. I told them we should go in, that I'd heard this thing before and last time it sounded like it got really close. They looked at me like I must be exaggerating and we kept on talking. Maybe 15 minutes went by when G sat straight up and said, "What the fuck was that?" Neither T nor I had heard anything and he started pointing by the shed and was about to say something when we heard it. A very loud howl, growl sound. It was over by the neighbors shed and it was overrun by another, lower pitched howl, growl. It was on the fucking side of the house, not 20 ft from us. We immediately shot up and bolted at the back door. I have never moved so fast in my life. Whatever it was, there was more than one. And it was close, sounded big, and aggressive. I was the last one in, being pushed out of the way in the mad dash to the door. I locked the door behind me. We were really scared. It was so close to us. We all started talking at once. "What the fuck was that?!" "I've never heard anything like that before!" "There was more than one, omg, it was like surrounding us!" We migrated to the living room. G decided that whatever, whoever it was, had to be dealt with. He has this big pocket knife, grabbed it and told T to come with him. T looked scared but didn't want to look like a wuss to his younger brother, so he went with him. I begged them to not go outside. The neighborhood dogs, save for one, didn't bark. In fact, it was weird, as loud as these howls were, there was no reaction. I think that creeped me out all the more. Were they as scared of whatever it was as we were? These dogs bark at everything and everyone, but hadn't made a peep. I was still telling my brothers to not go outside, but they disregarded me, this thing had to be found and dealt with. T and G went outside, they had me lock the door behind them. I paced by the door, peeked and saw them on the porch, talking. I thought, maybe we are being silly, but no sooner had that thought gone through my head when I saw my brothers stiffen and run back to the door. They looked so scared. I unlocked the door and let them inside, locking the door behind them.

"What the hell happened?!" I asked.

"It's still there!!" Said T.

"It's was hitting the side of the shed, slapping it," said G.

We avoided looking out windows for the rest of the night. G and I stayed up as T passed out on the couch. We discussed animals it could have been. Wolves? Coyotes? A bear?? It was definitely big. It was definitely aggressive, and it was more than one. We still don't know what it was. I told my boyfriend, who told G to go kill it. G said he wasn't going back out there. 

My brothers ended up spending the night. In the morning, G, told me he went back outside to see if it was still there, he said he heard it over by the shed, said it sounded like it was trying to break in. Still, no peep from the dogs.

Now, it's Tuesday night/Wednesday morning. I'm sitting alone in my house. My boyfriend is working and my roommate is on another business trip. Everytime I've heard it has been after midnight. I have my .22 nearby. I feel like I'm just waiting, but I refuse to go outside. Not after dark. Not anymore. There is something out there, and it is getting closer everytime I hear it. I don't want to go toe to toe with this thing. Not gonna lie, I'm still quite spooked. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was quite broke at the time so no taxi. It was only a few blocks, but it could have easily been the last time I walked free again. It was in the daytime, too. Close by UCF, which makes sense. Lots of easy prey around there if you are looking to nab girls. I definitely feel lucky I followed my gut to watch the vehicle. Looking back I almost could swear I felt being watched before I saw the guy, but that could just be hindsight.

If you ever have a daughter, I'd recommend she knows some self defense, or carries at least mace with her. I ran, yeah, but I would be willing to bet running isn't always an option. Luck was in my favour that day. But still, it was so scary. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When I lived in Orlando, I had a fight with my ex. He left me to walk home a few blocks. On the way home I saw a black suv with dark tint windows. The front passenger window was down and a man with black sunglasses was staring at me. It seemed odd, but I kept walking and watched as he pulled a u-turn. I thought he must've been going the wrong way, but kept an eye on the vehicle and watched as it pulled another u-turn and came back toward me. The guy sped up and turned into a side street where he abruptly stopped halfway in the turn and was partly on both roads. He jumps out of the suv, wearing a black suit, nice black shoes, black hair, and starts hauling ass towards me shouting Hey! Stop! at me. I never have ran so fast in my life. I ran down the sidewalk til I saw some bushes and people. I started yelling at them, but they never looked up at me. I ran behind the bushes and when I turned around the guy, and his suv, were gone. It was terrifying. I cried the rest of my way home, so scared the man would come back. When I got home, I immediately told my ex who told me I made the whole thing up just to make him feel bad for making me walk home. It wasn't long after that I found out about the sex slave trade and how many girls in Orlando disappear annually. My ex was a bastard, for the record. But that event, I try to really not think about, it makes my heart race with fear still thinking about it. </TEXT>

Not only did he scare me, he was very condescending to me and I had the realization that the spirit of discernment did not exist. Then I found out later he became a GA. I was very upset. I dislike that man very strongly.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I find there are some parallels.
1. The LDS has temples, Scientology has Training Centers.
2 They both have a Leader.
3. They both require time, and lots of it, from their members.
4. They both require money to use their temples and training centers.
5. They both have programs that take them away from family and friends. Missions for LDS and Sea Org for Scientology.
There are more, but I am tired. I've really looked into Scientology, even considered joining at one point. As time went on the less and less I wanted to join, however. They require too much of their members money. You can't leave without them harassing you, and it's much more intense than love bombing an inactive members house with candy and paper hearts riddled with scripture and "We miss you!" notes scribbled in Beehive handwriting. Missionaries go for 2years. But scientology has the Sea Org. This is a Million Year contract they get youth to sign up for. They are paid for their work, but it's slave wages. The men at the top of scientology are insane. </TEXT>
