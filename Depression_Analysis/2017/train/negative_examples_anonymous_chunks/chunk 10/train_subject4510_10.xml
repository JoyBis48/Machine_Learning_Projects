	<TEXT> What is this feeling of the walls creeping in, the quiet noise of forever, and the different shades of black. To bow without achievement, to leave without ever being known. I can not disclose my identity in the interest of protecting what I write. 

Look to the stars and tell me how big you feel? Take notice of the dirt below your feet and describe to me your home. There is so much *life* for you outside of the shell you currently *possess*.  

Envision a boy that battles daily with imaginary monsters. Each day the monsters make the boy more frightened. The boy flees to the nearest forest. He carefully constructs a fort made of branches. The boy feels free of the imaginary monsters, but wolves own this forest. 

What came first God or Man?

I cannot disclose my identity because my existence has long since expired, I don't know how long it took the wolves to pick up the scent of the boy, and I've never met God, but look to the stars and tell me how big you feel? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When you're mathematically out. Last year I had a bunch of injuries. Literally made the playoffs on the last game of the season by losing (the other guy lost too and I had more total points) Had to play our league leader that was something like 21-2 and I basically just meat shielded him (Put random double starters in every slot I had) and somehow won. Then went on to win the championship which was my 2nd in a row #Whoo!  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Cost to start a new server, reasonable estimate from previous free shard owners? </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I miss Ultima Online quite immensely. I was one of those rare weirdos that was fairly good at PvP and RP. I have somewhat of an idea to mesh the two. I'm working quite a bit and don't really have knowledge of constructing a shard. Could you have someone construct a shard and have it up and running for around $500 or is that unrealistic? I know it varies on the scope of work to be done so this is just more general estimates to anyone who has ever paid to have some work done on their servers. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 10 Player League (9 active) H2H, Dynasty - I'll include players I've received via trade. I've done a lot of wheeling and dealing to get my time where I want it. 

* C - Buster Posey - Traded Sony Gray last week for him.
* 1B - Anthony Rizzo - Traded Brandon Crawford, Joey Votto, and Eduardo Rodriguez last week for him. 
* 2B - Anthony Rendon - Drafted
* 3B - Manny Machado - Drafted
* SS - Carlos Correa - FA Pickup
* OF - Mike Trout - Drafted
* OF - Michael Brantley - Drafted
* OF - Joc Pederson - Drafted
* OF - A.J. Pollock - FA Pickup
* Bench - Joey Gallo - FA Pickup
* Bench - Victor Martinez - Drafted

* SP1 - Clayton Kershaw - Traded Cole Hamels, Carlos Martinez, Francisco Liriano, and Noah Syndergaard for Kershaw around week 5 or 6. 
* SP2 - Chris Sale - Drafted
* SP3 - Corey Kluber  - Traded Justin Upton for Kluber around week 5 as well (was about 2 days after the Kershaw trade)
* SP4 - Jake Arrieta - Drafted
* RP1 - Alex Wood (Qualifies on fox fantasy as a RP/SP) - Drafted
* RP2 - Huston Street - Drafted
* RP3 - Joakim Soria - FA Pickup, early in the year.
* SP5 - Garrett Richards - Waiver wire early in the year, have no idea why someone would drop him but luckily I lost my first game of the year. 
* Bench - Taijuan Walker - FA Pickup
* Bench - Scott Kazmir - Drafted
* Bench - Charlie Morton - FA Pickup
* Bench - Danny Duffy - FA Pickup
* Bench - Sean Doolittle - FA Pickup

How would you rate my trades? Would you recommend any areas I should look to improve? I'm trying to "regrow my farm" as far as pitchers because of all the trades. I'm thinking of trying to improve my reliever situation but I don't think I want to spend what it would take to get an elite reliever. I think the most I would trade would be Kazmir and I don't think the people holding the best relievers right now would go for that.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah I completely understand the idea that the best time to buy is whenever you're "ready," but I feel like 4K is pushing the advancement of GPU's faster and we're on the cusp of a large leap in hardware, similar to SSD's. I was tempted with the 980ti as well. Hopefully AMD's next GPU will be worth some of the hype and force Nvidia to quickly push something else out. I just want 60 FPS for 4K at around $500, then basically ride that out for 3-4 years before going SLI for another 3 or 4.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I sold my PC about 2 years ago and I've been itching to get another one. It's killing me because I feel like we're so close to 1 *affordable* GPU running 4k at 60 FPS, so I've been just patiently waiting... reading PC and hardware subreddits and crying.  </TEXT>

Whats the purpose of shards anymore anyway. Each shard should just have different rules, and have like 10 shards. I know this option is currently impossible because people would lose properties etc so take this as more of a rant.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The trick for me is if you miss a Monday or you just don't feel like going on a Monday or a Tuesday etc because you won't be able to get a full workout in etc, just go the following day or force yourself through a day you don't want to be there. I can't tell you how many lazy weeks have started on Wednesday but I still continued the rest of the week instead of starting a bad habit.

Also this is a little more difficult but I have a few friends I go to the gym with. It varies daily but it helps keep me motivated if I'm having one of those above mentioned "off" days where I'm not feeling it. </TEXT>
