	<TEXT> Yeah people frame Vinyls all the time so I figured why not do the same with Laserdiscs. They are about the same size and you get some awesome cover art. 

Only problem is they are getting harder to find at reasonable prices, especially well known / sought after movies. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I recently bought the Back To The Future trilogy on Laserdisc (Japanese version) and BTTF II had [this insert for the timeline for all three films.](https://i.imgur.com/dINfPTs.jpg) 

The films are in English but the inserts are all in Japanese.. So I was hoping someone on here might be able to translate the particular section of the insert showing the timeline?

My skills with a camera arent the best, but I took a full page pic as [well](https://i.imgur.com/NWXB0Ee.jpg)

Huge thanks to anyone that takes the time and effort to even attempt this.

The layout isnt final, not sure how to fit all three in without overlap / making it too noisy... might need to buy 3 smaller frames instead. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The person who "made" this did nothing other than generate a world in Minecraft and throw it on a USB. 

After that he sold the idea of the particular world created by the seed could only be played by one person as it's on a USB stick. If you want to play that particular world yourself... you need that USB stick. A good idea in itself but hardly worthy of a game design award.

Again, he did nothing, he did not create a game, he did not code anything, he merely generated a world in Minecraft using "Chain World" as the seed.

I like the idea though, if passed around each new player would shape that particular world. But in the end thats the same as playing online and limiting the server to one player at a time. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Even if you go by the Movie Man of Steel version of Superman he can still move faster than any human could ever react. He can still fire lasers from his freaken eyes powerful enough to cut through buildings etc as well as damaging Kryptonian Amour.

Hell, in the trailer for BvS he's shown ripping the Batmobile apart with little effort. He could do the very same to Bats new armour if he wanted to without much effort.

If Sups wanted Batman dead he would be dead before Bats even reached for the Kryptonite. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Game: Haunting - Starring Polterguy

Platform: Mega Drive (Genesis for you 'Muricans)

Reason for rage quit: It was an awesome game, original and quirky, scaring rich folk out of their homes with humorous haunting tricks. Then you reach the last boss which is unlike the rest of the game and damn hard too. I could never beat him. It's just a stupid blob thing that later splits into multiple blob things... But if they touch you it drains 3/4 of your health... I tried so many times till I just placed the cartridge in it's case and forgot about it.

I'm almost tempted to download the ROM just to prove I can beat it as an adult...  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No he won because Sups held back, like majorly, out of respect he didnt want to hurt or kill him. Where as Bats went all out giving everything he had.

Superman can move faster than Bats can even perceive let alone react against, he can rip through solid metal like butter for fucks sake.

Without plot armour Bats is a joke, just a rich fuck in a suit that would get destroyed by one hit from any metahuman.

If Sups wanted Batman dead he would be dead. No questions.

	<TEXT> The reason that the rich were so rich, Vimes reasoned, was because they managed to spend less money.

Take boots, for example. He earned thirty-eight dollars a month plus allowances. A really good pair of leather boots cost fifty dollars. But an affordable pair of boots, which were sort of OK for a season or two and then leaked like hell when the cardboard gave out, cost about ten dollars. Those were the kind of boots Vimes always bought, and wore until the soles were so thin that he could tell where he was in Ankh-Morpork on a foggy night by the feel of the cobbles.

But the thing was that good boots lasted for years and years. A man who could afford fifty dollars had a pair of boots that'd still be keeping his feet dry in ten years' time, while the poor man who could only afford cheap boots would have spent a hundred dollars on boots in the same time and would still have wet feet.

This was the Captain Samuel Vimes 'Boots' theory of socioeconomic unfairness

	<TEXT> Hey all, 

Thought I'd post here and see if anyone is interested, there a few part time/casual customer service positions available with Publicis Loyalty - Domestic and General call center.

It's a basic customer service role, all inbound, you'd be taking extended warranty claims for faulty products as well as follow up calls on existing claims. 

It's pretty much an immediate start with 2 weeks paid training.

If you're interested PM me and I'll send you the contact email address / phone number for HR.

Only available for the next hour or so, after that they're going to start taking applications through seek etc.

Edit: Whoa, an overwhelming number of interest, I think I cant take any more CVs from this point.
For those who have email their CV already I have passed them on and I hope HR will contact you shortly, if they do not I apologize in advance, there are limited positions available. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Nope, near the end he states very clearly what his intentions were from the start:

Hans: As thirteenth in line in my own kingdom, I didn't stand a chance. I knew I'd have to marry into the throne somewhere.

Hans: As heir, Elsa was preferable, of course, but no one was getting anywhere with her. But you...

Hans: You were so desperate for love, you were willing to marry me, just like that. I figured, after we married, I'd have to stage a little accident for Elsa.

He played nice, did what was required, only because he was not sure if his position was secured yet.

At the end when Anna is near death, Elsa is seen as a monster and sentenced to death there is no need for the charade any more.

That's pretty cut and dry, there is no need to try to explain it any further, no magic or meddling required. Hans was a dick. Simple. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> [Even Dwarfs started small.](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0065436/)
The inhabitants of an institution in a remote country rebel against their keepers. Their acts of rebellion are by turns humorous, boring and alarming. An allegory on the problematic nature of fully liberating the human spirit, as both commendable and disturbing elements of our nature come forward. The film shows how justifiable revolt may be empowering, but may also turn to chaos and depravity. The allegory is developed in part by the fact that the film is cast entirely with dwarfs.

Theres a 3 minute scene of a [dwarf laughing at a camel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJuaZKBABO0), if that doesnt convince you nothing will. </TEXT>
