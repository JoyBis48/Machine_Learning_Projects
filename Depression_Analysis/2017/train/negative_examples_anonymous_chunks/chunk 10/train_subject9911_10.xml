	<TEXT> I run AdAware in it's second line of defense mode so it just scans, no real-time protection. I've found that it finds more than the paid version of BitDefender. The downside is that the scans can take longer than other AVs. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The free version of Ad-Aware has found way more viruses than my paid version of Bit-Defender. You can install Ad-Aware as a 2nd line of defense by having Real-Time Protection off. </TEXT>
