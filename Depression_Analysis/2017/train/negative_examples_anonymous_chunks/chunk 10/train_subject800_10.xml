	<TEXT> There is already an Adventure Time game based on D D, in case you are interested. My Lady Blackbird version is much simpler and narration oriented. I don't have much, just lists with races and classes (including detective and ninja) and some notions about swords, princesses and lands in Ooo. I planned to get all the information I needed from an AT wiki.


Oh, also, it's all in spanish. I could translate it but it would take me a while. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't recall my typography  lessons very precisely but I think it all started with egyptian hieroglyphs. Complex symbols representing whole ideas and objects got simplified geometrically to represent sounds. This symbols were adopted by cultures like Greece, that were adopted by romans. So, letters evolved in time from very graphic symbols to letters that you can write fast.


I found this picture explaining it. It's in spanish but I think you'll get it.

Una cosa es que los gobernantes trapicheen a escondidas, tergiversen, hagan circunsloquios y jueguen con el lenguaje, o que los medios distorsionen las noticias como en el juego del telfono roto, no se documenten bien o elijan las que ms les convengan a ellos o a los gobernantes, y otra que un gobierno ponga en marcha un medio pblico, una web, para ir diciendo que un montn de noticias verdaderas son falsas.
