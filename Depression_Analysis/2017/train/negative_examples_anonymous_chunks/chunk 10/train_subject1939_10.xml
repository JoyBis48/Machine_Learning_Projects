	<TEXT>  Modern utopias tend to be different because instead of criticising our current world, they imagine what it could become if mankind makes the right choices etc... 

are those mutually exclusive? I would think most utopian fiction tries to do both: both show what's wrong with current society and show a better way.

	<TEXT> Yep, agree. Although 1 and 2 will normally win out in the long run even without luck. 

In fact, maybe I'd say you really need two of three. You can have luck and talent (e.g., I know people signed by big agents when they were in grad school and not even close to finishing a book), work ethic and luck (you grind it out and never do that well, but then one of your ideas just happens to catch on and be in the right place/right time), or talent and work ethic.... but you can't survive with only one.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It probably needs to be above average, but it depends on what you mean by debut/unknown. I think it is really really hard for a debut author with no credentials, platform, or name recognition to sell. It's much easier for a debut author who can get blurbs from authors, who publishes fiction and essays regularly, who has a couple thousand Twitter followers, etc. Having a famous agent helps too. 

There is so much that's a crapshoot and unpredictable though. You might have a hard time if your book happens to be too similar to a big book that just came out, or you might have a better chance if your book happens to be in a genre that just had a big seller. etc.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Creative writing courses - what is the consensus on these?

If you have a good class with a good professor, it can do wonders. People grow leaps and bounds in writing courses and MFAs. Seriously. However, I do think it's true that the biggest reason people grow so quickly is that they are putting aside the time to dedicate themselves to the craft. So you can get a similar experience by just truly making writing and reading your full time job. 

MFAs and genre writing classes don't really provide a great return on investment, so I wouldn't take them if they cost tons of money. But plenty of MFA programs are fully funded.  </TEXT>

I think in this day and age, these boundaries are less important. Jeff VanderMeer's popular and acclaimed Southern Reach trilogy was called science fiction, but was published by a literary publisher (FSG), and nominated for both literary and SF awards. 

That kind of thing is increasingly common in 2015.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 50% of what though? 

What I mean is, the market is FLOODED with crappy books. That's true. Bust most of those are books by celebrities, books by genre authors who pump out 10 books a year (normally with ghostwriters), lackluster efforts be veteran authors, and so on. Lots of others are in specific niches, like certain types of erotica and romance, that sell well no matter what. 

My point: a lot of the crappy books put out by traditional publishing are books by people or in niches that are almost guaranteed to sell some copies. 

The bar for being in the top 50% for debut authors or general literary fiction is probably higher.  </TEXT>

I mean its one thing in-universe where these heroes have been private for decades.

	<TEXT> I'm not sure what we are arguing at this point, but what I'm getting at is that guys with magical superpowers defeating evil villains through physical violence is SOOOO far removed from how morality really works in the real world that it really just doesn't have much bearing on real life. Not sure it really "teaches" anything or reflects our reality at all. 

Does that make any sense? 

Like at no point in most people's lives are they ever confronted with the change to save someone by beating up some being of pure evil. That's really not how it works in life, unless you are like a detective who hunts serial killers. In real life for 99.9999% of the population, people are rarely purely evil or purely good, and fixings problems is almost never solved by one good guy beating up one bad guy.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes, I think part of the appeal is fantazing that you, the reader, are Batman or Spider-Man or Wolverine or whatever. 

My point, I guess, is that good art IMPLICATES you, the audience. The audience is forced to question their own assumptions and morality in some way, ideally. But in most superhero comics, the good and evil sides are so clear and simplistic that you are never implicated. That's what makes it escapism. It doesn't challenge you, it soothes you. 

That's totally cool. Soothing fiction has it's place too. But I think Moore's point is that this kind of fiction has so utterly overtaken the culture that it is out of balance.

	<TEXT> I think maybe we're both mixing up "fantasy" as a genre and "fantasy" as unrealistic escapist fiction. When Moore is talking about superhero comics being a simplistic childhood fantasy of having powers to beat up "bad" guys, he isn't talking about it in the sense of "fantasy" like Game of Thrones or whatever. 

Fantasy, the genre, does not require childish escapism or black and white morality (though it does feature both sometimes.) Moore himself almost always includes some kind of magical or fantasy elements in his fiction and comics. He's not shitting on the idea of magic or unreality in fiction. 

What I meant is that even in speculative fiction, SF and fantasy and superhero comics, you can have complex morality. It doesn't have to be an escapist fantasy.  </TEXT>

It's unethical to break and enter... unless a hero does it. It's unethical to spy on people's minds... unless a hero does it. It's unethical to destroy tons of property... unless a hero does it. It's unethical to go outside the law for justice... unless a hero does it.

	<TEXT> I don't think you're understanding me, or I'm not being clear. 

What I'm saying is that in the real world, real good mostly comes from empowering other people and with smaller personal moral choices. It does a lot more good to give people in a third world climate the means by which to improve their own lives than it does to fight one bad guy. It does more good to root out structural racism in policing than it does to take down one racist cop. It does more good to fix the campaign laws that let corporations run our politics than it does to bust one politican for a sex scandal. 

But the superhero fantasy is this abstract one of a special individual with magic powers fighting some purely evil being. When I say it is a selfish fantasy, I mean it's one where the fantasy comes from the idea of you being in the place of the hero and you flying around saving the day one bad guy at a time. It's not about empowring people or fixing structural problems, its about "taking out he bad guy" all by yourself.

	<TEXT> I thought Civil War was completely ruined, even though the premise could be good. Instead of presenting the two sides as both having real points, they turned it so the pro-reg people were basically totally wrong and overreaching and willing to violate their own morality while the anti-reg people were the clear heroes. 

It's doubly annoying because the pro-reg people are obviously right: in the real world, we wouldn't want private citizens with no regulation to be using superpowers in public like that... just like we don't allow any random citizen to purchase tanks, bazookas, and nuclear bombs. It takes a lot of narrative twisting to make people who are against registering what are essentially nuclear bombs held in private hands into heroes.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In addition, even when superheroes are shown to have truly made a mistake--which is rare, but happens sometimes-- they are never actually punished. 

Take the last avengers. Tony Stark tries to play god with a machine defense system, and ends up causing the deaths of thousands and almost the destruction of life on earth. Not only does he not actually, I dunno, get sent to jail for life or suffer any kind of punishment he saves the day by... playing god by making a superpowered machine. He literally saves the day the same way he threatens the day. 

Same movie: Hulk goes crazy and does massive damage, probably killing many. We see him sulking and feeling bad about it, but he again isn't imprisoned or hidden away from society to stop him constantly killing people. (I know the movies don't show him killing exactly, but if you are smashing over buildings then people are dying). 

Batman hacks everyone's cellphones, suffers no punishment for it. so on and so forth. The good guys "learn a lesson" but never get punished. That's part of the fantasy.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  The superhero genre is one of the best at pointing out that altruistic motivations do not justify any action.

Totally disagree! I think the ENTIRE fantasy of superhero comics is that the ends justify the means if you are a good guy. 

Superheros are at their core vigilantes: people who illegally fight crime outside of official channels. They break and enter, assault people, and do lots of other things that legal law enforcers are not supposed to do. But the idea is that since they are "good" and have good motives, it's cool that they constantly break the law. 

But it goes beyond just that. Every psychic character violates not just the minds of evil villains but also, at some point, heroes/friends/family in order to save the day. Every tech genius type violates privacy and hacks into databases to save the day. You can go to Cracked.com types sites and see tons of lists of "insane punishments by Superheroes" where they do really messed up things to supervillains that would certainly violate our ethical standards if a police officer did them. 

etc. 

Superheroes embody the "end justifies the means" ideal.  </TEXT>

Yes, obivously if it was real life then the Avengers saving humanity from evil aliens is "good" and "builds a better world"

That's not the point. 

The point is that having a handful of magical misfits beat evil alien invaders is just a simplistic and childish narrative structure. That's fine if it is a kid's movie, but Moore's point is that the culture as a whole shouldn't get so wrapped up in that kind of childish fantasy. 

Like someone else pointed out, even in fantasy you can have more moral complexity and a more interesting fantasy world with something like Game of Thrones.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  seem to appeal more than patriarchs like Captain America and Superman.

What are you basing that on? The Captain America and Iron Man films were HUGE successes, and the 2 most popular superhero films ever are far and away the 2 Avengers films, where Captain American and Iron Man are basically the leads. 

I think the fact that Superman's last couple films haven't been reviewed that well is just that they are bad movies, not anything about the character's lack of appeal. 

There is certainly an appeal to the X-Men/Spider-Man "losers who turn out to be heroes" school. For sure. But that doesn't really have anything to do with what I'm saying. I'm saying the fantasy tends to be about an individual saving the day, as opposed to a community empowering itself or a hero spreading power to the disenfranchised. Like, you never see a superhero film where Iron Man gives technology to the inner city poor or Spider-Man helps lead a revolution. 

That's all fine. Superhero films don't have to do everything. But it's a narrow, individual fantasy.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Honestly feel that the rise in superheros movies has more to do with general market dynamics than with anything about millenials or our current political situation. 

Basically, movies are driven by the global market now and the only thing that does well in the global markets are flashy big budget action films that can be enjoyed across cultures even if you don't understand all the subtext. 

On top of that, people flock towards familiar names, so turning widely known comic book characters who have been around for decades into movies is just the obvious course. 

I'd lump these Superhero films in with Harry Potter, Hunger Games, and the rest of the big budget action franchises in this regard. The trend is towards that more than superheros per se.  </TEXT>

Also, on a narrative level having an individual overcome enemies through their own boot-strappiness is always going to work better for a story.

They were correct! He is quite literally a bug in the story. Not sure why that's hard to grasp.

have you read Kafka's other work? Almost all of it involves the surreal and the fantastic. These weird goings on are "literally" happening in the same way there are literally dragons in Game of Thrones or there is literally a man with giant wings in Gabrial Garcia Marquez.  

  I answered saying that insects breathe through their skin, and he couldn't actually let out a breath if he was one. 

Then how do you explain his ability to crawl up the wall? The fact that Kafka didn't know the anatomy of beetle breathing is more likely a mistake (or a mistranslation on the translator's part). 

 So if Kafka's character was actually a huge bug, then why would his family or sister take care of him? how would she know it was him?

	<TEXT>  Their argument was that Kafka wrote such straight-forward pieces the rest of the time, that this was his venture into the fantastic

waaaah? Kafka wrote straight-forward pieces? 

What Kafka are you referring to? The Trial and the Castle both have completely surreal bureaucracies. A Report to the Academy has an ape turning into a gentlemen to avoid the zoo. "A Country Doctor" is the height of the fantastic and surrealism, weirder than any Dali painting.  

basically all of his stories have the fantastic and aren't straight forward at all? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Canon is just anything that happens that "counts" in the world, so I think what you mean is not canon but backstory and exposition? It definitely drags down the pacing of a book to put too much of that in the text. 

Even a writer like Tolkien who was obsessed with his world remembered to stick a lot of his backstory in the Similarion where most readers wouldn't bother with it, so LOTR doesn't get too bogged down.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  When I write, should I lean for a more "neutral" text, or more of something that the character would say?

There is no "should" or "shouldn't" here. Lots of amazing books come from an omniscient or neutral 3rd person POV, and lots of other amazing books use what is called "close 3rd person" or "free and direct speech" (that's when you dip into the characters heads, and thus speak more child-like when using POV of child). 

There is no right or wrong though, it depends on how you like to write and what you want to achieve.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Let me note here that I actually don't even like Franzen's work much, it just isn't for me. I don't care about realist depictions of the American middle class. Snore. 

BUT I don't think any of Franzen's hate is about his fiction, which is wildly popular among readers despite the claims of him being a snooty highbrow elitist. It is all about his persona in interviews and in essays.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Franzen is basically hated because he's a grumpy opinionated guy who is willing to state his opinions even if it means getting people mad. He doesn't play the "like/reblog/share!" economy of modern technology where it pays to be super positive about books and authors all the time... unless you are attacking one of the preapproved targets like EL James or, well, Franzen. 

I don't even like Franzen's work much, but the hate he gets is silly. 

What are the roots? There are two main ones

1) In the early 00s he picked a fight with experimental and literary authors essentially arguing that good fiction is popular with readers and follows conventional narrative structure, and posing experimental literature as some kind of threat to good fiction. A lot of experimental writers took issue with this, especially because... why bother picking on writers that so few people read anyway? How are experimental writers a "threat" to reading when most people have never even picked up a single book of experimental writing? 

2) The Oprah Book Club debacle where he expressed some ambivalence about being picked for the club, worrying that he'd be read as a beach read instead of as a serious work of fiction. This got him accused of sexism and cemented his reputation as an elitist literary snob.... despite item 1). 

So. After the above, Franzen was kind of hated by BOTH the postmodern/experimental/forward thinking lit world AND the populist/middle brow fiction world. Not a great position to be in. 

Then two pretty crappy chick lit writers, Picoult and Wiener, decided to boost their own careers by whining about how Franzen was getting too much attention for FREEDOM and claiming it was proof of both sexism and of "popular fiction" being overlooked. There IS plenty of sexism in literature, but the second claim is pure nonsense because Franzen is a massively best-selling author. The Corrections and Freedom both are in the top 10 year-end best seller lists... no Picoult or Weiner books are. So by their own logic, he should be getting far more attention. 

Anyway, both of them have big twitter followings so they convinced an army of chick lit fans that Franzen was this evil literary snob. So now he was hated by the high brow/experimental set, the middle brow/Oprah populism set, AND the low brow chick lit world. 

After that, every time Franzen whines about something--and to be sure, he does whine a lot--(twitter, global warming, whatever)--or says anything negative about an author (DFW, Salinger, Edith Wharton) he gets a swell of hate from all sides.

If he'd just sat back and been positive about everything and cheered everyone on, no one would hate him.

No matter what you think about the whole issue, Amazon is working to undercut prices to levels that aren't sustainable for print books and which put bookstores out of business leaving Amazon with a monopoly on distribution. 

Now, you can certainly think the above is fine and say that ebooks are the future, print and physical bookstores should die, and that if Amazon becomes a monopoly another eretailer will emerge to compete. I've seen plenty of people here even argue that publishers should all die and serve no purpose. I disagree, but that's fine. Still,  it is certainly easy to understand "why publishers are hostile"! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've never been a systems analyst, but being a copywriter, social media manager, and so on can be just as soul crushing. 

If your goal is to be a creative writer of some sort, my suggestion would be to get whatever job pays the best for the least and write your stories/memoir/novel on the side. 

If you want to be a content writer, you can actually get paid pretty well to be on the staff of a place like Buzzfeed, Gawker, etc. But you'd have to spend a while building up a freelance portfolio--which pays much worse--before getting that kind of gig. 

It's also possible to get good gigs as a copywriter or copyeditor, but again I think freelancing some is the best way to get there.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well we may just have to agree to disagree. Having worked some in film, the constraints of budget and other outside factors like shooting schedules for actors can drastically impact work. Scratch that, I'd say they ALWAYS impact every single TV show or film. 

It's why TV shows do "bottle" episodes, or why certain segments of TV shows can be so much worse (example: the Dorne storyline in last season of Game of Thrones had a rush turnaround and much smaller film team). 

Yeah, sure, of course all art forms get impacted by money and other factors, but a novelist will never have to write off a character because the actor lands a better gig or cancel their plan for an army of dragons because the FX budget can only make one. Those factors in film are huge. 

But that doesn't mean film is better or worse than books. It's just one difference.  </TEXT>

It's the most expensive TV show ever and has a gigantic cast... yet it still has to drastically cut down set pieces, characters, and battles to be filmable. I guess I shouldn't say more without spoiler warnings, but if you've read the books you know what huge set pieces get left out for budget reasons. 

And, again, that's with like the most popular and expensive show on TV. For more moderately budgeted work, you get even less.  </TEXT>

I'm not sure what you mean by "detailed" but it is certainly true that books have unlimited scope in what they can depict in a way that films (at least non-animated ones) don't have.

First off: "genre" means more than SF/Fantasy. Erotica, Romance, crime... plenty of genre work takes place in our world and there is no alternate world/timeline/ or anything else to juggle. 

On the flip side, plenty of "literary" writers from Shakespeare to Kafka to Murakami use unreal elements in their literary fiction, so lit fiction can juggle the unreal too.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I could type an entire book length reply here, but here is the TL;DR version: 

"Genre" means multiple things. If by "genre" you mean formulaic pulp fiction that tries to be as generic as possible and repeat what's been done, then yes, that kind of genre fiction is less meaningful and artistic than great literary fiction. This kind of "genre" really does exist too, bookstores are filled with it.

BUT BUT BUT "genre" also refers to books that are every bit as artistic and meaningful as "literary fiction" but just happen to feature some tropes that we've clumped together and called a genre. 

Ursula K Le Guin, Gene Wolfe, Raymond Chandler... great "genre" (2nd kind) authors are every bit as good as great literary authors. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes and no. It's true the mass market publishing industry uses a lot of ghostwriters, but they don't pump out 20 pages "books" ghostwritten by some schlub in Asia being paid 100 bucks.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You are totally right, but this also feels kinda pedantic. I've worked as a copywriter, freelance writer, social media content writer, and so on and those jobs bare little relation to fiction. Yeah, technically words on paper, but it's like saying you can still have a job as a "director" by making flash animation advertisements, or you can still have a career in "music" by programming the playlists in department stories </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Do what you love passionately and competitively, and the money will come.

This sounds nice, but obviously not true. Most wannabe artists don't end up making any money, and even many of the greats died in poverty only to have their work discovered or get popular after death </TEXT>
