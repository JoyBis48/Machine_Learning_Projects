	<TEXT> It's set up so it takes 1,000 years to mine. There was a pre-mine that was supposed to be set aside in a vault in Antarctica. More was to be used to purchase an office building. They had a bus tour scheduled in NY to scout out locations for their office tower. And users would be able to purchase oceanfront real estate near other like-minded Marinecoin faithful. Not sure whether this oceanfront RE was supposed to be in NY or Antarctica. The thing is, it wasn't a joke. When you talked to the people, they were dead serious...like a cult or something. It may still exist, I haven't heard lately.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Exactly. The sacrificial liberal challenger. It used to be a mainstay of Democratic primaries to have someone left-of-mainstream who could get young people, unions, and traditional constituencies fired up and ready to pound the pavement for the mainstream candidate when they eventually make peace. Nice to see Sanders catching some attention.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Drafting a popular running mate from Florida or Ohio? A Republican candidate could put Scott Walker on the ticket, since he comes with the Koch Brothers wagonload of cash. Bush's opponents (both his GOP rivals and Hillary Clinton) should mention his quote that Americans need to work longer hours. If they handle it well, there should be no way Bush wins the presidency after saying something like that.  </TEXT>

But if they can be content with a predictable, fixed return, then it can work. There certainly are some very greedy and poorly run utilities in various parts of this country.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Which place do you identify with the most? If it's the state where you go to school, try running a Google search for voter registration in that state. Make sure you register to vote well in advance of the election you wish to vote in (say, at least two months beforehand to be safe). Some states allow provisional voting for last-minute registrations, but don't count on it. If it's your original home state you want to vote in, then even if you aren't physically there for the election, you should be able to vote early or vote by mail. Again, check their requirements.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It sounds great and I'm all for equality, but the market (not the government) sets the pay for pro athletes. With few exceptions, womens' sports do not command the kind of TV ratings or sponsorship dollars that allow some male athletes to be grossly overpaid. And even when they seem overpaid, that money comes from somewhere: the public will pay a certain price for entertainment.  </TEXT>
