Makes you wonder if in the future our present science will be viewed similarly primitive, if despite all the development and refining of scientific method (our present science may seem almost perfected) we have overlooked/didn't consider something. Or rather,  scientists know they have,  because of all the yet unexplained phenomena like nature of dark matter or presence of technetium in some stars.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What about pathogenous bacteria? Pathogens are fairly easy to grow (I'd know as I routinely grew bacteria in high school and it was often contaminated by more dangerous bacteria) and you don't need acces to the water supply to be able to infect a lot of people - you could smear it all over public transport or air vents or something. There probably wouldn't be many (if any) deaths, but you might sow fear in people's minds. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> All schools I went to were public and they were good. But I live in Europe and don't know what the situation is in the USA, so I am not qualified to judge it, I think.

Still, I think it just isn't worth it to send your daughter into faith-based schools (faith-based education is a little bit of an oxymoron, isn't it?) and take a risk that she ends up being indoctrinated.

On the other hand, if you guide her to skepticism and reason, she might be able to learn about Christianity while keeping her sanity intact. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi, the newly released animatic of the super amazing feely ubersong is so epic that I need your help to fill in what I missed and overheard in transcribing it
[Here is the song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETMPVpJDHoA) and here is my draft of the lyrics (I am updating it at the moment):

EDIT: The MLP wiki seems to have been updated, there is no need for my continued existence now. Copypasted text:


        I'm here to show you who I am 

        Throw off the veil, it's finally time 

        There's more to me than glitz and glam, ooh 

        And now I feel my stars align 


        For I had believed what I was sold 

        I did all the things that I was told 

        But all that has changed, and now I'm bold 

        'Cause I know 


        That I am just a pony 

        I make mistakes from time to time 

        And now I know the real me 

        And put my heart out on the line 

        And let the magic in my heart stay true, whoa, whoa, whoa 

        And let the magic in my heart stay true, whoa, whoa, whoa 

        Just like the magic inside of you 


        And now I see those colors 

        Right before my eyes 

        I hear my voice so clearly 

        And I know that it is right 


        I thought I was weak, but I am strong 

        They sold me the world, but they were wrong 

        And that I'm back I still belong 

        'Cause I know 


        That I am just a pony 

        I make mistakes from time to time 

        And now I know the real me 

        And put my heart out on the line 

        And let the magic in my heart stay true, whoa, whoa, whoa 

        And let the magic in my heart stay true, whoa, whoa, whoa 

        Just like the magic inside of you 


        Just like the magic inside of you
