	<TEXT> Non-disparagement clauses aren't commonplace in the traditional entertainment industry (they might be when you're affiliated with networks, but this is different than an NDA entirely) The Non-Disclosure Agreement would've been signed between Arin and Jon the moment they co-founded this business together. It's just common practice, especially in the entertainment industry.

And Polaris doesn't control any of their partners. Multichannel networks function more like agents/managers. They find better deals (such as brand deals, direct advertising, which means higher CPM rates) for a VERY small percentage of the profits. The only one with power in the relationship between content creator and MCN is the content creator </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think you're woefully underestimating what running a business is like. You also seem to think it's somehow easier if it's based around a youtube channel, video-games or both.

The amount of work that goes into simply managing taxes, income distribution, etc. is daunting alone. Sure we all want to be playing video-games for a living, but the truth is that's simply not what they do. They release a product to an audience (that involves them playing video-games) and they capitalize off of ad revenue and merchandise. (And it's been an intellectual property since day one. They both understood the importance of building a brand and selling yourself, they talked about it often) </TEXT>
