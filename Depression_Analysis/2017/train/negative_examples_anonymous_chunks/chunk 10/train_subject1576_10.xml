In early sobriety I was dealing with lots of heavy weather including coming to grips with being criminally prosecuted over unfiled and unpaid taxes and losing my professional license and career.  I was psychologically miserable, but I got counseling, dove back into AA and I got through it all, one day at a time.  Today, my sobriety is my most valuable asset. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The great insight that I had about cravings is that it is an emotion just like anger, joy, jealousy, sadness.  In our case a craving is a powerful desire for alcohol and like all emotions it is fleeting.  Generally speaking time heals everything--including cravings.  One other thing, I was able to move along the healing considerably when I recognized that I am ex-drinker and therefore I no longer process that emotion. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Beautiful and touching post.  I was the king of false pride and pretend courage.  I guess what I'm saying was that the precursor to honesty for me wasn't so much courage as a whole lot of exhaustion and a tiny bit of willingness to admit that everything I felt, everything I thought might, possibly, could be...wrong.  With that openness to the possibility that I was living a lie--everything changed.

Great track.  Here's one [Live Forever](https://youtu.be/aeJ4kp1AwY4) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I strongly suspect that my alcoholism was related to, caused, or significantmy aggravated my psychological disorders.  When I stopped drinking and got SOBER in addition to AA meetings I went to see my shrink.  That was great too.  AA encourages this explicitly in the Big Book.  But the most important thing for me is that self knowledge alone did not get me or keep me SOBER.  My participation in a recovery fellowship made all the difference. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In the FAQ (on the sidebar) there is this [link which attempts to set some of this out.](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/36cgmh/faq_timelines/)  Can I add as someone who has some time in sobriety including a prior 15 year continuous stretch of sobriety, that I would take all of this as very generic and only slightly relevant to your potential experience.  While we can all generally talk about withdrawal, breakthroughs, insights, recovery--because of who we are individually and genetically each of us may have different experiences.  Factor in the quality of individual effort at recovery and you have a whole other factor to consider.   Good luck to you--as a general rule: what effort you put in, is what you get out.  Remember the [Baby Steps](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) say we act our way into better thinking. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think the distinction may have more to do with the traditional approaches to recovery--the 12 Step, AA model of recovery was based on a "singleness of purpose" which is to recover from alcoholism, BECAUSE prior recovery models: the WCTU, the Oxford Group, the Washingtonians all failed with multiple goals, issues, and ambitions.  AA officially declared we will deal with alcoholism and alcoholics ONLY.  This has changed considerably over the years but in my nearly 30 years in AA I've seen actual hostility to drug addicts and arguments about the appropriateness of mentioning drugs of any sort in an AA meetings.  Although no less a dualy-addicted recovering alcoholic by the name of Dr. Bob Smith (AA's co-fonder) discusses both issues in his famous "personal story" that begins the second section of AA's Big Book.  

By the way, not to argue with JBH,  alcohol was wholly illegal (Prohibition) when the modern recovery movement was founded in 1935.  So, embedded in our thinking (and the marketing of recovery by treatment centers) is the idea that addictions ARE different from alcoholism.  Whether this duality has a scientific basis or not, I have no opinion.  Still he distinction probably has more to do with the historical duality that is a legacy of the success and failure of recovery movements.

One other point: AA has dramatically de-emphasized the "singleness of purpose" observation and even traditional AA strongholds around Cleveland and Akron where I am active easily  embrace participation by both alcoholics and addicts. </TEXT>

Here's how I do vacations: I wake up and decide that I am not going to drink TODAY, only.  I usually hit a day time AA meeting and then I go for a long bike ride.  Sometimes I'll hit an early evening meeting too.  If there are any AA activities, dances, golf outings, etc. I might do those events too.  I hang out in coffee houses and I go to movies.  Have fun.  Then the next day, I do it all over again.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Welcome /u/dr_eleanorabernathy to r/stopdrinking.  Thank you for the introduction.  Let me share with you the [link to the Baby Steps post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) which describes how I stopped drinking and how I got sober.  I'm told the ideas there are helpful and "next" steps to doing this whole sober journey.

One other thing, "rock bottom" in my experience is not a place, it's a metaphor.  When we have had enough, when alcohol is no longer fun, that's rock bottom.  Oh, sure we could keep digging, or in my case drilling--but it doesn't change the fact that I hit rock bottom.

Good luck and I hope you keep posting and updating as you go along. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So what else are you doing /u/razmataz_90 besides not drinking and some diet improvements to recover from the alcohol abuse that put you in the hospital with pancreatitis?  AA meetings, IOP, counseling  I would think that people are asking these questions because THEY CARE ABOUT YOU.  

When I was in early recovery my family and friends asked because they love me and were pulling for me to fully recover.  I had to stop being a resentful, selfish prick and learn to accept the support that came my way.  Even if it's just a question about my course and treatment, it is caring--and the least that I can do is be grateful and by sober actions show that change is REAL.   </TEXT>
