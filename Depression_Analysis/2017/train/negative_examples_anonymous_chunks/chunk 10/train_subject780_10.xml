	<TEXT> roughly 20 years ago I wrote a paper for a college class comparing American worker productivity with European worker productivity.   Obviously I don't remember details, but the gist of it was something like *our own* Department of Labor's studies say that European workers are more productive than American workers, despite being worked "to death" </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So, I have this odd thing ... I've never been a massive salad fan and I'm usually disappointed by them in restaurants and rarely eat them at home, but if you get me in an office cafeteria salad bar I go absolutely crazy. I just love it when they have like 70 different ingredients to choose from, and I'll basically choose them all. Chickpeas, brocolli, cauliflower, carrot, jalapenos, black olives, green olives, banana peppers, kidney beans, and more.   They get pricey, and sometimes they get so large I can barely finish them, but I love them.  And honestly jalapenos on a salad is great.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I can't remember where or find the post, but someone asked about meatballs. [This is a phenomenal recipe] (http://www.food.com/recipe/authentic-italian-meatballs-92095).   I just do one extra thing - I brown them in olive oil first, to the point where they develop a slight "crust" on them.   Absolutely amazing recipe, I swear it's difficult to not eat half of them right out of the pan.   

Today I chose to finish them in sauce for pasta, but every time I make these I wish I had cleaned out the freezer first and made a whole freezer's worth. 

If you're still buying frozen meatballs, stop it.  Just make this recipe once and you'll never buy frozen meatballs again.

	<TEXT> Uhm, if I were say stuck in a cabin with vegetarians for a week, and NOT from a mixed household I think I would get frustrated at a lack of meat.  Especially if most meals featured fake meats (I love fruits and veg, but never found a fake meat I liked).  She just sounds like a bitch though. 

Edit: let me explain that first sentence a bit ... not trying to insinuate that a week with vegetarians is a sentence, but if you're an omni, and I'm guessing particularly in the US, you're probably used to a good deal of meat in your food.  Like breakfast, lunch dinner.  If you converted to vegetarianism than you probably know what I mean.   If you aren't prepared for a week of pure vegetarian meals, this can be a big change.  And, if you eat like I used to, you may literally not even appreciate vegetables and fruits.. so suddenly going "cold turkey" especially if you aren't prepared for it could be tough.    

She still sounds like a bitch though.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is good life advice in general.  

Regarding sleep ... this was a big problem for me.  My early 20's was spent learning how to ignore my body ... ignore that pain, ignore that need for sleep and created serious sleep issues that carried over for a long, long time.  My civilian career choice and lifestyle of burning the midnight oil didn't help one bit either, but I'll tell you honestly you don't realize how much relatively minor but long-term sleep dep fucks with you until it ends.  I'm not talking going 48 without sleep (we've all bt,dt I'm sure) but I mean just like getting 6-8 hours of sleep but very poor quality, for months or years at a time.   

And friends and family - yes you have to MAKE time.  Especially once you get a busy civilian life going.  I like literally schedule lunches and beers with folks just to stay caught up.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So we planted a couple squash seedlings earlier in the year and before you know it we have WTF large squash... like over a foot long.  We've literally never seen squash like this - they're easily four, five times bigger than any we've gotten in stores.

I'm thinking of making a chili out of one of them, perhaps along with some zuke and firmer meated veges to add more texture.

I don't want to waste the novelty of having a ridiculously large squash by just chopping them all up though.  Any ideas on what we could make that would keep them somewhat preserved in their shape ?   Stuffing one has already come to mind, for sure, but looking for other ideas as well.   

A squash boat of something ?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have made a few dishes with MDH's buryani massala at home, and then shortly after tried a new Indian restaurant and I *swear* they used MDH.  It has some very distinctive components to it that are rather unmistakeable. 

Out of curiosity do you think it's rather standard for restaurants to use packaged massalas instead of making their own ?   The dish itself was still much better than I can make at home, but I was a bit surprised - not offended or put off mind you - to realize it was prepackaged massala.   I guess it's just not economically viable to have someone making a million different spice blends in the kitchen every week.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> [Serious]  I've eaten a ton of Indian food, although all in the US and UK and I'm not Indian.  

I have eaten "bizzare" food that's kind of "shock value" like in the movie. I've eaten ant eggs, grasshoppers and other bug stuff in Mexico, and I ate the head of a goat also in Mexico.  This is all currently available in some quite popular restaurants there.   In Cairo I ate brain of something- it was 20 years ago and I don't remember what or which part of town it was. 

Never in Indian cuisine though have I heard of anything like what's in that movie ... I'm sure it's all for effect to enforce the "exoticism" of travelling overseas.  Another common mechanism for this is the "market place" ... you'll notice there's a recurring them in movies of showing crowded noisy marketplaces with all sorts of bizzare things for sale.

In the Carribean you can get ox tail soup.  In other parts of the world there are other equally unusual foods such as fried scorpions, fried frogs etc, but I've never come across or heard of anything quite like that movie. 

Edit: the weird foods I've eaten were not created for shock value; they are very traditional foods for that region... we chose to eat them more for experimentation and their "shock value". </TEXT>

Any recommendations on a reliable, truly well made (not just well made for mass produced crap) that will work accurately and confidently for years to come ?  I intend to use it for both frying and candy making ... or perhaps I should have two specialized thermometers ? 

Edit: Hey everyone, thanks for the great comments.  Seems like ThermoWorks is the brand to go with and has a couple great choices as well ... Dot, ChefAlaram, ThermaPen ... decisions decisions. I've seen their stuff in the past but never thought I needed to invest in a thermometer until this commodity one I used last night ruined dinner... so a ThermoWorks is in my future.  Im going to keep them in mind for gifts for my buds who cook as well.  Thank you  ! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> On my left is a long piece of door trim that I'm probably supposed to be putting up instead of wasting time on this site.  This stuff is only about a half inch thick ... it's too spindly to be useful in a 7 foot length like this, so I think I would break it into three pieces: First break it in half - use that half length piece with a sharpened end as a stand off weapon, then take the second half and break them into quarters, and use them as beating weapons; they're be shorter and sturdier.  I could also sharpen them and use them as stabbing weapons.    

Definitely not the ideal weaponry, but it's the best I can think of with this.  FUN GAME OP !    </TEXT>

	<TEXT> yeah, it's completely different stressed on your feet and shoes:)   
I haven't found running shoes to be very good for anything *but* running.  Mine at least really excel at forward motion, but the second I ask them to do anything else it becomes obvious they weren't made for that.   they also aren't going to handle abrasions, spills, lateral movements, standing etc very well. 

but still, panel separation in a few weeks sounds abnormal either way ... you should probably take them back to Lukes, be polite and chill of course but inquire what they think the usual  lifespan is.  If you liked the fit of those shoes tell them ... but also tell them that you do need shoes to work in as well.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> tl;dr: the solution for a bad pair of 120 shoes isn't a 60 pair.  

Your 120 shoes shouldn't have worn out that quickly.   Are you wearing them all day, every day or just saving them for running ?  Do you seriously pronate and wore out the treads in one spot ? How many miles a week do you run ? Are you doing other athletic things in them, playing ball, etc ?  Running shoes are made for forward motion and not lateral motion, stops etc.

Instead of looking for cheaper shoes, I'd try to isolate what went wrong with these first, and even try to return them.  I haven't found actually running shoes I would trust on my feet in the 50-60 range.  

In fact, I started the opposite, some cheap shoes (because seriously who the hell pays for 120 dollar sneakers, thats ridiculous right ? ) and they ended up lasting merely weeks and hurting me...I returned those, went to a running store, got fitted for actual running shoes by actual runners who knew what they were talking about.  Yes, they cost about 120 bucks but my injuries almost instantly resolved themselves, and they've already lasted three times longer than my previous shoes, and have a couple hundred miles left on them even.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> thanks, I just gave it a whirl.  It actually did a surprisingly good job of pulling comps only from the equivalent neighborhood (this neighborhood is an "in the middle" one ... with much cheaper a few blocks one way, and much more expensive a few blocks the other.  But it looks like it's just scraping other public websites ... I guess since rentals probably aren't recorded transactions there isn't going to be a lot of hard data on actual numbers other than "this is what folks have been asking for in the area". 

Which is good enough I suppose... I just want to make sure my maths are in the ballpark and I'm not being delusional. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi everyone, 

I'm preparing to do some fishing with my son while on vacation, and we haven't touched any of our equipment in like 7-10 years.  Would the mono I have on the reels and in the tackle bag still be good ? It was all protected from UV but not necessarily heat and humidity (in a tackle bag in the shed).   Also, looks like I have 4 and 6 on them (according to the empty cardboard boxes I wisely also saved in the bag).  Thing that would work for shorefishing mackerels in Maine ?   There's an unused 12 pd as well. 

thanks !  </TEXT>

I used Kyle's for many years.  I have quite a large yard and they cut it for years for only 45 dollars, and they would even let themselves in and out of the fence as well as move the patio furniture and trampoline for that.    Sadly I had to cut back on costs and I stopped using them, but it had nothing to do with them, and actually cut other costs first so I could keep them on. 

If you're interested I"m sure I can dig up an email address for you.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's s not actually a chile powder, it's actually chile.  That's it.  Dried, ground Dixon Hatch Chiles, not recipe and nothing else to it, I just covered the pork in it.  

   I buy the chile online from the Chile Shop in Santa Fe, New Mexico.  I discovered that shop while on a business trip and have been buying them ever since (mail order).   The hatch chile is the famous "green chile" of New Mexico (now becoming pervasive in Colorado as well, although it may not be the same chile as the famous Hatch, New Mexico variety.   

Served green, it's a great, brightly flavored chile with just enough kick to satisfy a pepperhead, yet not offend those with milder palates.   In the right parts of the country it's actually pervasive in the cuisine, served as both ingredients in dishes as well as sauces as condiments. I've had the famous "green chile" in quiche, omelets and anything else you can think of.  In New Mexico specifically it's companion is Red chile, and you can order a combination of the two as "Christmas".

When dried and ground this chile takes on a completely different persona, from a milder brighter flavor to a remarkably dark, robust, earthy tasting chile that actually reminds me a bit of roasted coffee beans.

I use this chile in everything.  It plays a prominent role in my brisket rub, which I intentionally keep simple, savory and spicy.   It' also plays a smaller role however in my rib rub, which is a complex brown sugar based rub.  It goes in my chili, it goes in my blackening mix.. it has essentially replaced cayenne and ground chipotle as my go to pepper now.  

The only areas I won't use it are Asian or Indian preparations, which very specifically call for their own unique heat sources.  For any SouthWestern/Mexi/TexMexi meals though it's an awesome chile. 

I still eat jalapenos, both fresh and pickled.  I still love my Tabasco sauce, but for a chile powder this is my favorite by far now.  </TEXT>
