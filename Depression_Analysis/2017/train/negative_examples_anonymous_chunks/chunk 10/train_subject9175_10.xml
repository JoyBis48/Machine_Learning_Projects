	<TEXT> I have a two year old and have started watching more kid's TV and movies. I have a strict no crap policy (Lilo and Stitch YES, Lilo and Stitch 2 NO) and am loving watching a generation of movies I missed.

This morning we watched half of Bolt before I dropped her at childcare then I came home and watched the second half by myself. 

So what other great kid's movies have I missed?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I got a response: 

********

OMG what rock did you crawl out from under down under?

Talk to the people who actually work there, those clubs are all the same when you work in them. I mean do some real research at least. Even I've done that much and it's not my subject.

You are only a tourist, WTF would you know unless you worked there.

The clubs you are talking about like in Kings Cross in Sydney are sleazy dirt bags, because the men made them that way. Australian men are insecure around strong women, so they keep them down and call them con artists. You are calling them con artists, because you are ashamed of yourself for not realizing what the club was when you walked in there, so you blame the club and the women.

But it's the women who suffer, because you put them that much further down on the totem pole of hierarchical society.

Australia has been bleeding its most beautiful and intelligent women since year do, because of forever being put down put down put down. You make everything sleazy and disgusting, nobody is allowed any pride in their work, they all have to be desperate. . Also because of idiots like you writing about women being con artists, because they can't get decent paid work in the straight world. And why not, when they get told they are overqualified for a normal job in Australia, or are a con artist for trying to not be on the dole bludging off Australian tax payers or their parents.

Australia's employment and DNA problem is because of idiots like you who have no real world education and put down women who want to do better for themselves without charity.

When visitors come to Australia they see under 21 year olds who can't handle their alcohol in the bars causing fights; really good look for Australia that is. This doesn't happen in California because the age for drinking is 21, when humans are physically and mentally better able to handle substances, and in Europe they simply have better educations.

Overseas, Australian men are an embarrassment. They can't handle their alcohol and they don't know how to act around strong women, or in public.

Write a book about that and you might have an international best seller. There are lot more strong women than men outside of Australia, plus all the Ozzy anything fans, they'd love reading it.

Get out of the gutter, as you really don't know what is there, because you are only a tourist. You are complaining of the same thing you are doing, being a con artist, selling false information.

Write about what you know, which is idiot Australian men.

FYI: My day job is audience development for writers.

Let me know when you are working on that book, I may be interested in helping you.

It has been brought to my attention that not every channel on a mixer will necessarily have a preamp meaning I can't plug a microphone in every channel and get the same output.

How can I tell which channels are suitable for recording from microphones?

	<TITLE> What skeptic issues do you think most effect young people? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> My name is Nicholas J. Johnson. For those who don't know I'm an author, magician and skeptic who performs The Bad Science Show at high schools around Australia.

I teach kids about critical thinking using magic, comedy and sideshow stunts. Australian skeptics might remember me as the con man from the Skeptics Convention last year.

I'm revamping The Bad Science Show at the moment would love some impact on what you think are the important issues facing young people in skepticism. It could be a particular issue such as vaccination or more general concept such as the need for empirical study.

I currently discuss psychics, placebo effects, gurus, ghost sightings, pareidolia, water divining etc.

Love your input!

	<TEXT> In this thread there are a lot well meaning people saying that if only LGBT people today dressed conservatively or acted with class then they would be taken more seriously.

One of the key elements to the whole Gay Pride movement is for people to be proud of who they ARE. So they dress up in revealing, camp costumes because that is who they are. They express themselves.

Tellng gay people you can't take them seriously if they don't act 'more straight' is kind of messed up.

About five years ago I shot the Australia series of The Real Hustle and we pull that exact scam in an Australian jewellery shop. There was no bishop involved but the basic scam was the same. I played the cop and had a fake badge designed by the Channel 9 props team even though police in my state don't carry badges.
