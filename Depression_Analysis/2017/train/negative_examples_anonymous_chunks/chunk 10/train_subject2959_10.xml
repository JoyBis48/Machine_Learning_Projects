	<TEXT> My girlfriend recently has started taking antidepressants (Lexapro). I have known she has been depressed, but she really struggles talking about it. Anytime it ever comes up, she says that she hates talking about it and quickly changes the subject. How can I get my girlfriend to try to talk about her depression with me? 

What are better ways to phrase questions such as
"What do you think the source of your depression is?
Is your depression situational or clinical? What exactly have you been diagnosed with (All I have been told is she has anxiety and depression, nothing like the name of a specific disorder). 

I know that a depressed person has trouble explaining how they feel to a person without depression, but how can I get her to open up to me so I can help her more? Am I actually completely wrong in trying to do this? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My girlfriend just started taking antidepressants for her depression. She is really struggling to open up to people about her depression. I want to help so badly, but all I really know is that she's depressed. I don't know what's causing it, if its situational or an actual disorder. How can I get her to open up to me/how can I help her cope with/overcome her condition? </TEXT>
