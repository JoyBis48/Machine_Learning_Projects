	<TEXT> No. It's no different than finding bullets from the civil war in a field or Indian arrowheads. If it was found in a national park or a preserve, then it would be different. There are protected sites on the island where the main battles took place, just like any other country would have. You can't remove items from those areas. </TEXT>
