It's the fact that this article shows Hillary in a bad light is the reason it was hunted down and removed. They will allow multiple posts showing a politician they do not like in a bad light. You will not get by with multiple submissions if it has anything to do with showing a Democrat or Progressive in a bad light. I have tested this theory over the years.

	<TEXT> I agree. Just felt the F-22 was better suited for dogfighting than the F-35. 

Found this decent comparison.

 F-22 and F-16 have two major things in common: both are relaxed-stability designs and both have LEX. As such, similar wing loading figures and thrust-to-weight ratios will result in similar maneuverability, especially since F-16 was designed to achieve optimum performance when two wingtip AAMs are present.

 With 50% fuel, 2 Sidewinder and 4 AMRAAM F-16C has wing loading of 392 kg/m2, thrust-to-weight ratio of 1,186 and weights 10 936 kg. F-22 has wing loading of 313,5 kg/m2, thrust-to-weight ratio of 1,29 and weights 24 579 kg. Thus, while F-22 will suffer maneuverability penalty due to its size and weight, it is unlikely that F-16C will be able to outmaneuver it.

 With F-16A it is a different story. With empty weight of 7 076 kg, it has wing loading of 349,5 kg/m2 and thrust-to-weight ratio of 1,29 (figures for 50% fuel and 2 Sidewinder). While its wing loading is higher than F-22s, F-16A is far lighter and smaller, so it is possible that it could be capable of matching the F-22. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What about the F-22 vs the F-16? That is a dogfight I want to see. The F-35 and F-16 are two different types of aircraft. The 22 would be a better fit for dogfighting the 16 than the 35. </TEXT>
