	<TEXT> Um... Season 4 and 5 were basically locks. Even Alaska-ers couldn't deny they knew Jinkx would win... And.... Like Sharon Needles wasn't gong to win. There's no lock yet. My theory is they humanize Courtney more as they have in the past episode and she wins. It's going to be Bianca, Adore and Courtney. Bianca is too much of a cunt for my tastes. She would come for girls who were obvious a little wacko, but didn't deserve it in the moment. I think she's funny and all, but I don't like her 2 facedness. She seems to rely on not being shady to Adore to not seem like such a shady bitch when really she's a shady ass bitch.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I haven't read the book or seen the UK version but I think the next season may be last. I think I'd like that if it has a nice arc and doesn't run out of steam. I look forward to the House of Cards crumbling even though I'll cringe through the whole thing. I hope it's a super gory Shakespearian tragedy. Rachel and the hacker are going to play big parts in undoing President Underwood.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have to agree partially with your reading of the film. I don't necessarily remember the aspect ratio change but I agree that the film ends with a celebration of Jordan. The Kiwi's at the end who try to sell Jordan the pen are idiots. They don't have that natural talent that he and his friends had, they're not gifted like Jordan was. Jordan entered the pink sheets room and he was able to make thousands while everyone else was making chump change. To me, that's what the film was saying. Some have it, some don't. Jordan had it. 

The thing I have to disagree with you about is that the empty stocks don't equal the film. We aren't being conned like the people in the film. I think the scene shows some, if not most people, who will see the movie, and will think it was just entertainment, when there was really a commentary on them taking place. You won't ever be Jordan Belfort. We aren't Jordan Belfort, and Jordan Belfort deserves all his spoils because he was able to get them. He's a wolf, and his audience are sheep.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What gives you the idea that this scene is Scorsese's commentary on Belfort? What I mean is, what indications does he give stylistically as the director? I don't necessarily disagree with you but the scene I found most commentative was the scene where Jordan has the girl shave her head. If you rewatch it the scene has a very creepy song and the lights in the scene begin to flicker as if something is awry. Beside that, I really felt like, overall the film wasn't really a commentary on Jordan on account of him being the narrator, it was more of his vision and glamorization of things, which in a way could serve as a lens to create your own commentary if you look at it as a whole objectively after watching. 

Other moments did seem as though they had a minor bit of commentary such as the scene with the usage of the song Gloria had a comedic sarcastic tinge to it when the boat crashed. That may have just been me, but it felt like using the song was saying "Wow, this guy keeps dodging bullets, this story is just too incredible to be true. And he's an asshole!", and then to top it off, other people die in a plane crash by the innocuousness of a seagull while he's drinking during a dance-rescue-party on a boat. It made me giggle cause it just went to show how insanely lucky Jordan Belfort was. 

The scene that really set the tone for me, in terms of the film having a commentary, was when Jordan is talking about how great things are going at Sttratton Oakmont, and it feels like a non stop party. He talks about one of his friends who marries the girl who fucked everyone in the office several times, and yet he still marries her and then kills himself 3 years later... It's during a fun and upbeat song where everything is going great and  everything feels oh so fun, that we get this little ping of morbidity, and quickly Jordan recants back to the good days, not dwelling on it, because we have to get back to Jordan's story, not dwell on the soullessness of his business. I think, Jordan being the narrator is also why we never see the lives of the people hes taking from. In our own stories, regardless if we are good or bad people, we are the hero. Jordan wants to be seen as such, and when he's bad, he's being good.  </TEXT>
