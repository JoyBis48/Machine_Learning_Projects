	<TEXT> May 1942, somewhere over the Coral Sea.

The night sky is illuminated and air deafened with speckles of anti-aircraft fire, a Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress known as the Pacific Pearl and its fellow squadron soar in formation. The right propeller putters to a smoke billowing halt as its struck by enemy artillery. Veteran Pilot, Skip, and Co-Pilot, Holden courageously man their airship through a less than routine bombing run over hostile territory. Two crewmen, within the waste of the aircraft, haphazardly empty their staggered M2 Browning machine guns, blindly hoping to make contact with the deadly streaks of light originating from the ground below. Situated in the belly of the ship, a gunman unleashes lead, oscillating inside the dual mounted, spherical Sperry turret. The plane's tail is battered with stray munitions, yet maintains its course. At the nose of the plane, one nameless patriot mounts his Bendix chin turret, attempting to visualize ground forces. A sudden and forceful explosion of AA canon fire bursts directly in front the Pearl, obliterating the glass and metal comprising the nose and instantaneously ending the life of the bombardier within. Another blast detonates a hole directly at the Boeing's cabin, sending a shock wave of shrapnel into the nearby gunmen. Their bodies contort and rear on the cold metal floor, as their own blood fills their waning breaths. The B-17 wavers to maintain altitude as continued bombardment causes the ship to pollute the air with streaks of smoke and flame.

Come on, Skip! Fly this bucket and get us the hell outta' he-, screams the radio operator prior to him and his quarters being peppered with machine gun fire. His body quivers, as he instinctively grasps the blood oozing from the last bullet entry wound at his right arm. The pain departs, and he becomes unconscious - his body falling limp within his chair.

The bomb bay doors slowly part open, releasing multiple pairs of half ton whistling M44s upon their decent to destruction. The Pacific Pearl, now a war torn tin can of its former glory, limps gingerly away from the theater of battle towards a hopeful full moon. The former fortress and its scant crew rumble forward as pilot and co-pilot can now safely assess the damage.

I think we're hit pretty bad, Skip, says an uncertain Holden.

You better go back and see how bad it is, states Skip.

Okay, Holden responds with a sigh as he stands to remove his headset. Can you keep er' in the air, Skip? Holden inquires, placing a mutually reassuring hand on the pilot's shoulder, making his way to the cabin.

Yeah, yeah, sure... Skip quickly responds.

Upon entering the cabin, Holden is immediately greeted by a crewman face down nearest the cabin entryway floor. Kneeling down to investigate, Holden slowly flips the soldier face up, revealing multiple bloody bullet holes through his chest and one through the eye, directly piercing the man's left glasses frame. Holden jumps to his feet startled, backing away in shock, uncertain what to do but proceed forward. He reluctantly continues through the corridor of the airship, with only the vibrations of the passing air to break the silence. Holden gently creaks open the subsequent chamber's doorway, unveiling two bloodied gunmen lying lifeless across from a sizable hissing breech within the plane's haul. Holden leans against the metallic column connected to the roof of the rig, holding in place one of the bellied turrets. Unable to retract the turret's entrance latch, Holden gives two firm knocks upon the hollow metal alloy.

Nelson? the co-pilot beckons to the gunner, giving three more knocks. No response. Unbeknownst to Holden, the turret operator lays deceased within his glass coffin - a single projectile penetrating the rounded window, into his chest cavity. Holden examines the bodies of the two adjacent gunmen, unwilling to make physical contact as one of the men's eyes remain open, hauntingly gazing into nothingness. He lightly sneaks past the corpses, as if not to disturb their eternal slumber  a passive observer in a surreal reality.

Holden lowers his head making his way towards the tail of the plane. He can see a crewman sitting in a chair, facing away from him, peering out a broken rear window. He nears what he believes to be the first living causality of the day's combat. He rotates the swiveling chair, hoping to arouse an unconscious man. Turning to face him, with mouth hanging ajar and eyes transfixed, the departed crew member's intestines grotesquely protrude from his abdomen. The body falls directly at Holden's knees, splatting as the internal organs spill onto the ground.

Before Holden can react, through the shattered rear glass, a short distance from the plane's tail, he spots what can only be described as a floating orb, glowing a deep mesmerizing green.

Jesus... He shutters to himself in astonishment. Holden reaches for a nearby transmitter, building his courage to speak as he brings it to his mouth. Skip... Something's following us...

What is it? Responds Skip.

It's some, some kind of green meteorite...

What!? Skip gasps. Where? He asks, turning his head in all directions to spot this anomaly. The orb swiftly descends under the aircraft, latching itself to the belly, causing the plane to abruptly jerk in the air. The sharp movement causes multiple compressed air tanks to fall from their shelves, crashing onto Holden, momentarily knocking him unconscious on the ground. The orb begins to pulsate a bright luminescent green energy that begins to engulf sections of the Pacific Pearl. The bodies of the now dead crewmen begin to collectively glow a similar rhythmic translucence.

Holden! Are you okay? Skip beckons over the radio system. Holden's eyes slowly open to consciousness.

Uh...Yeah, Holden groans, shaking his head. I'm coming back, Skip, as he raises his body out from under the air tanks. Skip looks frantically about the cockpit, unable to spot anything unusual outside the aircraft. Holden groggily makes his way towards the front of the vessel. The motionless corpse within the tail of the plane begins to irradiate acid from its body, as if from within, revealing a bony decomposing monstrosity. The claw-like fingers of this previously deceased human begin to quake with life.

Holden, with his head still throbbing from its previous blow, re-enters the waist of the ship, the same haul breech still humming a familiar tune of death. Yet, one obvious detail plagues his already clouded mind. Where were the two dead gunmen? Holden, completely unable to comprehend the difference between truth and reality begins to tremble in a lucid fear. He staggers to turns his body, tiptoeing backwards towards the front of the plane. In his shivering retreat, he is halted with a clank as the back of his boot makes contact with the last known location of Nelson. With one last attempt, either out of spirited curiosity or cowardice fright, Holden crouches to unlatch the turret enclosure. Cautiously he lifts the hatch and peers in. A gut wrenching roar and two ungodly arms grasp him by the coat, heaving Holden into the glass prison. His screams of pain mix with monstrous growls as he's thrashed about. Blood can be seen trickling in droplets from outside the transparent sphere.

What the hell's happening back there!? demands Skip. No response. Shoot, he mutters to himself as he flicks on the Automatic Pilot switch, removing his headset and standing to investigate. As he casually turns the door handle to exit the cockpit, Skip is met face-to-face with a moaning monstrosity that was once one of his crewman. Portions of its skin and tissues have seemingly melted from its body, with only remnants of their uniform and hair covering what appears as a walking, decomposing skeleton. With a reflexive outcry, Skip slams the flight deck door in the beast's face. Left flabbergast, Skip slowly withdrawals to his pilot seat, frantically reaching for his Colt M1911. Trembling, he aims his pistol at the door - of which begins to bend and mold under the force of the atrocity's power. He squeezes his trigger twice, recoiling with each ricocheting discharge. The metallic entrance collapses under the power of the creature, revealing two more fiends lumbering towards the pilot quarters.

With what is seemingly his only remaining option, Skip desperately dons a parachute, opening the emergency exit latch located at his feet. He sits at the edge of a darkened abyss as he takes one last look at what appears to be the walking remains of his deceased crew, snarling and gnashing in a maddening blood lust. With a leap of faith, Skip hurls himself into the cold darkness. Wind rushes past his ears as he plummets towards the earth. He yanks his ripcord. Shortly thereafter, he is jarred by the flutter of his parachute bringing his body to a looming descent. Silhouetted against the first break of dawn, Skip spots the Pacific Pearl  now nothing more than a cascading asteroid.

After what appears to be only a momentary respite, the pilot finds himself making a gentle landing on an unknown tropical beach front. Releasing himself from his pack, Skip stares up at the darkened sky, caressing his own face in awe, as if to affirm to himself that he's still alive. The island is lush with the sounds of populating insects, frogs and birds. He cautiously makes his way towards and through the dense jungle that lay before him. Brushing aside vines, Skip curiously gazes through an opening in the vegetation. The pilot is taken aback in astonishment at what comes into view. From tree line to tree line, as if planted by design, dozens, if not hundreds, of timeworn air crafts lay crashed and abandoned  engulfed by the overgrown flora. Skip begins to drift through the airship graveyard, taking note of military vessels from all makes, models, nations and creeds. Without warning, the squawking of a fearful feathered creature brings him to a heightened alert. Beginning with a low gurgle, Skip hears a familiarly repugnant sound emanating from what appears to be every and all directions. In a frenzy of terror, he becomes aware of bubbling growls accompanied by the crumpling of rustic metal quickly surrounding him. Paralyzed in fear, Skip witnesses hideous mutations of what were once downed pilots, emerge as deforming horrors  rotting skin and musculature held in disarray about the bodies of these once presumably men. Countless numbers of glowing green eyes surround Skip as the bellows of inhumane morbidity grow in cacophony. Years of suppressed fear explode from the bottom of his diaphragm in a voice shattering wail. Yet, the pilot's cries echo into silence, amidst the Coral Sea air. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I had recently committed sin to the point where I disgusted myself and the sight of sexuality outside of marriage made me heart broken and I decided to stop PMO. I thought I had it kicked, not doing it for 2 weeks without a sign of weakness. I was so proud. And that was my mistake. I went from one sin of lust, to the sin of pride in my own abilities. But then, I found myself burning with the desire to PMO. I convinced myself that it would be okay to attempt masturbating without any sort of external stimulation or internal fantasy and to just look at it as a bodily necessity. Which ends up just being a statement that I can control my own body the way I want. Which then led to PMO. And now, here I am again. Low. Broken. Fearful of death. Duped by myself and most likely Satan.

I realize the best way to break this is to have the discipline I briefly found, grounded in deep hate for sin and its effects, but also to primarily and forever abide constantly in the peace that is found in what JESUS DID on the cross. Not my own strength. Forgive me.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Agreeable. But its so confusing, because the old testament does actually discuss the presence of Giants, with actual dimensions and issues they caused the average man. I don't think the word "Giant" was simply discussed in such detail strictly for metaphor. 

I mean, legitimately, there is mention of Giant individuals within the biblical text. I think when I have more time I'll gather up everywhere it mentions Giants in the bible and we'll examine the context and translations together. But I do see your perspective :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> * bn hlhm () the sons of Elohim (**sons of God**)

Genesis 6:2-4 (ESV)

2 the **sons of God** (Angels) saw that the daughters of man were attractive. And they took as their wives any they chose. 3 Then the Lord said, My Spirit shall not abide in[a] man forever, for he is flesh: his days shall be 120 years. 4 The Nephilim[b] were on the earth in those days, and also afterward, when the sons of God came in to the daughters of man and they bore children to them. These were the mighty men who were of old, the men of renown.D

* bn hlhm ( ) the sons of Elohim (**sons of God**)

Job 1:6  (ESV)
Satan Allowed to Test Job
6 Now there was a day when the **sons of God** (Angels) came to present themselves before the Lord, and Satan[a] also came among them.

There are multiple references throughout the Torah (Old Testament), discussing the presence of entire tribes of giants present before and after the flood. The later references being in Deuteronomy, where in Deut 3:11 -- "Og King of Bashan was the last survivor of the giant Rephaites. His bed was made of iron and was more than thirteen feet long and six feet wide. It can still be seen in the Ammonite city of Rabbah"
-- and you of course know the story of David and Goliath (considered to be a descendant of the Anakim, descendants of Nephilim). Goliath being 9.5 feet tall. 

It is with my understanding from the various accounts within the Bible, that the Fallen Angels exited the Heavens, manifesting within the physical realm, to sin against man, and conceive hybrids with the humans. This caused chaos within the Earth, but also could very well corrupt the bloodline of Christ, who needed to be directly descended from Adam. Noah was not a "Perfect man" without sin, but perfect in his adamite genetics. Thus, God preserved Noah's family before the Deluge or flood. 

The Sons of God that Paul references in Romans 8:14 , as you know, are the spiritual sons, adopted into the vine of the church body, through the acceptance of the sacrifice of Yeshua, Jesus Christ.

	<TEXT> Genesis 6:4 - "In those days, and for some time after, giant Nephilites lived on the earth, for whenever the sons of God had intercourse with women, they gave birth to children who became the heroes and famous warriors of ancient times."

Giants were a thing in the old Testament. Fallen Angels manifesting themselves within the mortal realm to Sin against man and procreate with humans, creating the hybrid giants. Demons are separate from Fallen Angels. 

What lens of Paul are you talking about? Where does he mention the inaccuracy of legitimate giants within the ancient texts of the old testament/Torah? And where does he mention them as military leaders instead?

There are multiple accounts of Giants within the old testament. A breed of creation used to tarnish the human bloodline of the savior, Jesus. Thus, requiring the Deluge (flood). 

Your interpretations of the old testament giants is rather contrived, in all legitimacy.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It sucks being human. It's amazing to me that the biggest differences between every person is "what they believe". It's like we're all walking through a vague fogginess. I wish we all instinctively understood the same truth and reality. So much ambiguity. What are your thoughts? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The context, my friend. The narrative context of creating the world in 7 days is presented in what we may often consider a poetic and metaphorical style of writing that was so common of creation accounts in most religious texts -- and thus, understandably ambiguous. Jesus' encounters with "demons", at least within the context of the scripture, is very hyper specific. That is to say, you can't really derive much meaning from these portions of the gospels other than Jesus was rebuking dark spiritual entities. There's not much room for interpretation, in this context, other than what is explicitly stated.   </TEXT>
