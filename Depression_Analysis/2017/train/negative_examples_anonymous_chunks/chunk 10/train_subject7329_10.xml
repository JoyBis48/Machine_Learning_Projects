	<TEXT> yah  i agree with BuiltToSpil1 (amazing band too)  but i get 60 1 mg ativan a month and they used to hit me but know they make me feel normal.  I have used/abused everyother benzo and xanax is the best imo for recreation but I am not using for that anymore . I only use when I really have to and find some extras by the end of the month.  i would saw ativan is a coors light compared to a mickeys or steel reserve (xanax) haha i dunno might not be the best comparision </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am currently getting 60 1mg ativans a month.  I have been with the same doctor for about 6 months. she started me at 30 .5 ativans so I am pretty happy she's jumped me up this fast. My question is I want to change my script to klonopin since from my experience they last longer.  So far pretty much any request I have asked to change my meds she easily has done for me. I have also been on SSRI anti depression meds for about 15 years now so I'm not just someone trying to get high. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hello I have been on an SSRI (Paxil) for about 12 years.  I got on it for depression and anxiety.  It's worked OK for the depression but I have in the last few years been suffering from pretty decent anxiety. I went to a counselor that works for the county and she was really nice.  She diagnosed me with anxiety and PTSD.  On friday I go in to the actual doctor to "get something for my anxiety" I used quotations because this is what the counselor said.  What would they give me to go along with the SSRI I am taking?  Thanks for looking. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It takes a while to find the right person that you can work with.  For me it has at least. I have recently been working with a mental health worker that has assessed my situation. She says I have anxiety/PTSD.  I'm going back on Friday for my actual medical visit with a doctor to give me/ alter meds.  I have been on Paxil (SSRI) for 15 years.  Hopefully I will get to finally have a med that works better than Paxil for 15 years. The lady that I have been working with is going to come in with me to the doctor and she said "at the very least we need to get you something for your panic attacks"  I was glad to at least hear that.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you are seriously in pain and can prove it, there should be no big problem obtaining medicine for the pain.  Depending on what it is they might only start you out on 800mg Ibuprofen or Tramadol.  I used to get 120 10/325 Norcos every month from my doctor til that ended badly. Your most likely going to have to work your way up to something decent.  It's getting hard now to get anything unless you are dying or have cancer.  Doctors are really getting nervous to script narcotic pain meds because of the DEA cracking down.  I have been told this from doctors themselves. </TEXT>

I really have no tolerance I guess now because I haven't been able to find a doctor to script me anything.  I looked last night a few hours online for etiz online to buy but I guess I was on the wrong sites because everyone was sold out. That is why I am now considering another RC.  I would like to pay with credit and I am very weary of getting ripped off. Do you know of anywhere that rates these sites?  I guess it would not be good if I asked you for any places online to buy?  sorry about these remedial questions but I want to know these things before I place and order and get ripped off. Thanks.

	<TEXT> So within the next couple of weeks I will most likely be put on ritalin or adderall.  I used to take dexedrine for ADD as a kid back in middle school.  Now as an adult (32) it was recommended I go back on something to try and help with my ADD.  I have done some research but would there be any reason to try and get adderall over ritalin or vice versa?  Do they still prescribe dexidrene?  I would just like some opinions from people that have taken both. thanks. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> i'm on methadone now. been at the clinic about 8 months haven't missed a day.  I can't say that methadone is a godsend but it's helping- i have relapsed twice very early on in my recovery.  At the dose i'm at now i wouldn't even feel any opiate so I don't bother.  I still am pissed when I think about that day at the doctors office though!!  I try not to dwell on it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> yeah i've been told that actually.  Thing is can't you go into a doctor that is certified to prescribe methadone for pain and tell him you want to be switched from your meds to methadone?  I guess he would just have to look at you and your history and see if you have dr shopped or been flagged at pharmacies before?  I was going to do this when I was on norco and wanted to stop taking it but I just ended up going to a methadone clinic. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> i assume your a guy. how old are you?  seems like a situation like me when i was referred to PM from my regular doc.  she had meset up 120 yellow norcos a month for a couple years so i thought i'd be getting stepped up since I was being referred. She even told me I'd get something better.  First thing when I walk in the head dudes office.  He reads my papers and his eyes just buldge out  " you've been talking all this norco for how long?!?!?!"  "Why?!?!?"  So I immediately knew I was over with ever getting narcotics again.  It was the worst feeling of my life actually.  I tried to hold in not crying.  He sent a note to my regular doc no more narcotics and that is that.  fuck that fucking guy.  The reason why I shared my story is that I feel its very similar to yours where I was doing good, felt comfy at my prescription and didn't feel like it would ever be taken away since my doc I'd been with for 10 years and was almost family to me.  So when I went to see her after the meeting with top scumbag at PM she just basically told me she has to adhere to whatever he says since he's a higher up.  Just so pissed man, one minute I had my doctor telling me that once I'm on PM they will bump me up to something better that Norco the next minute I am prescriptionless.

	<TEXT> Even my own doctor that cut me off last year told me it was crackin in the early 2000s then once about 2010 came around doctors are like WTF we are up shits creek here because we've been way over prescribing narcotics and people were popping them like candy.  That's exactly what my doctor told me as she yanked away my script that i had for 2 years for 120 norcos.  I believe her some but she also said the DEA are finally getting they're act togother after so many famous people died roughly in that decade due to narcotics prescribed by them from their doctors.  It sucks now because anyone with legitamite pain it's nearly impossible to get something past tramadol because doctors are scared they will lose their jobs.

	<TEXT> I was always scared of H because of the stigma that it has.  Since we were little kids I believe that the government, media, your parents, etc always would tell you never to do drugs but I felt that they put the most emphasis on H being that it was the strongest drug that could kill you the fastest.  Anyways I grew with that injected into my brain so that when I actually tried it for the first time I was kind of underwhelmed to be honest since I was already using norco and oxy, I was told its way cheaper to just go the H route and it is but If I had unlimited money i'd go withthe pharms over H just mainly cause its from a lab so you know what your exactly getting. </TEXT>
