My relatives take in kangaroos after they have been orphaned, abandoned or injured. 

They have been doing this for 10-15 years and have never asked for donations, but as carers across the state are running out of space they would like to extend their kangaroo yard to be able to take in more kangaroos in need.

Please help if you can, any amount will be accepted with enormous gratitude! 

thank you!

Also, please check out their facebook page to see where your donations will go to https://www.facebook.com/eyrepeninsulakangaroorescue </TEXT>
