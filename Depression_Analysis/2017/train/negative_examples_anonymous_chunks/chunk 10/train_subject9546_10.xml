Because he has literally had a handful of matches on the main shows.  He is still in the very early stages of his career in the WWE. 

I wish his character either had more depth or they just pushed him as an asshole that can have a really good match

He is literally that.  He is an asshole that has had amazing matches.

	<TEXT> Wow... there is so much wrong with that that my head hurts.  

You have no clue what was intended for Rusev if he hadn't gotten injured.  He was supposed to be in the IC title match and there was a good chance he was going to win. 

Wyatt has always been the character that wanders and randomly feuds with others.  This was happening before he ever started the Cena feud.  Also, the guy got to face Taker at Wrestlemania which is something someone who is doing poorly wouldn't get an opportunity for.  He is also in a meaningful feud with someone the company views as one of it's top stars, whom he also beat last night.  

Not everyone can be in the title pictures so there will be feuds with others.  People automatically view someone not feuding for a title as they are buried and just losers.  There is too much importance set on the titles being the only way a wrestler is not "buried".

All of these people are still on TV and getting stories and feuds so yeah... </TEXT>
