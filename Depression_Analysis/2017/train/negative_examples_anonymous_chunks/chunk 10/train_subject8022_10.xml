	<TEXT> The Eastern side of the state is getting hit particularly hard, including much of Idaho. It's really bad, but at the same time it's really interesting. If you like adventure, I highly suggest checking out some of the record low lakes and rivers around. Parts of the Snoqualmie river for example are a trickle right now in areas that'd be over a person's head in a normal water year. Keechelus Lake is another interesting place along I-90, and with its record lows right now it's a lot of fun to hike/explore areas usually under water this time of year. 

If we have another mostly snowless winter I think we'll be in super super bad shape. So hopefully checking out record low bodies of water is a limited time offer only. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It bothers me that you appear to be one of "them"... But the reason was to get away from the brigading caused by one stupid comment. I was very active in programming and financial/investing subreddits where people had a lot of questions. I'd contribute efforts to help those seeking help, but when all my comments were downvoted by the SRS members it was a bad deal because it made my advice look like the wrong advice, and could have an impact on those asking for advice. It still doesn't make sense to me... This was a couple of years ago so maybe SRS has changed, but back then their actions were completely inappropriate imo. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> SRS thrives on harassment and they really need to go... I had to create a new reddit account because I made a joke about feminists with my last one, not even meaning to offend anyone. There was a post about some misguided feminists at a rally that attacked a photographer for doing his job, and I posted a comment like "I volunteer to be the bus driver for the next rally... But our first stop will be a cliff.". SRS found out and followed me around downvoting me. They also doxxed me, found out where I worked, and tried to get me fired... All because I made a stupid comment which I don't think any reasonable person would associate with being serious.

This went on for months before I deleted my account, and it caused me a lot of stress. If that's not the definition of harassment I don't know what is. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think small drones with mounted projectile weapons will be the future of warfare. It won't be long before they start making appearances in insurgencies however, then regulators in the states will probably go nuts.

Or just imagine how much damage could be done with drones and explosives that have either encrypted / frequency jumping communication or pre-programmed GPS routes. It's a defense nightmare. About all you can do today is construct a giant net around what you're trying to protect, and even that isn't very feasible. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This doesn't seem like a bad thing. It's really easy to circumvent if you really want too, but it also offers protection to common users who want their privacy.

Imagine the scenario:


**With protection on the image and platform**: Person A sends a 'personal' image to person B via email. The image is set to be viewed only once. Person B saves it to his hard-drive, and then opens it. The client/platform allows person B to view it, but it also triggers the image to become protected/encrypted. It is now no longer viewable. Person B sells the computer but unwisely does not erase his data. The buyer finds the image but cannot view it.

**Without protection**: Person A sends a 'personal' image to person B via email. Person B saves it to his hard-drive, and then opens it. Person B sells the computer but unwisely does not erase his data. The buyer is cleaning up data on the machine and comes across the image, opens it, and can view it. Now the buyer can post it on the internet, keep it on his machine for viewing, and just be generally creepy. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> oDesk used to be very good. It has since been renamed to [UpWork](https://www.upwork.com/) . However with bidding sites such as that you'll likely find you are competing against many developers in other countries who are far more willing to work for less compensation.

If you don't want to start your own side project, one way to get side work is to post on sites such as Craigslist, and/or look for requests for help requests in the 'gigs' section. For example for Seattle, there are quite a few 'gigs' available: https://seattle.craigslist.org/search/cpg

Just be careful to not break any contracts with your employer, such as working on a project for competition.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've screened a lot of resumes and done quite a few in-person interviews as a developer.

My suggestions (Specific):

* Instead of listing "C++/CLI" under languages just put "Managed C++". 

* For frameworks just put ".NET" instead of listing 4.0 and 4.5

* Drop the Methodologies bullet point. It doesn't really add anything useful.

* "real-time streaming SQL queries" seems like a poor description. I'd suggest something like "using SQL integration to display data"
* For the second job, combine the 2nd and 3rd bullet points.
* "The end result of the project would be a poker bot". This is a big red flag for me. You say "would be"? So this is an unfinished project I assume? If it is, either finish it, reword the description, or remove it all together. Personal projects are a huge bonus when I read resumes, but a single unfinished project gives me a negative perspective unless it's actively under development. 

For the short jobs, there isn't much you can do about that, just be honest. 
 
My suggestions (General):

* If you can list some accomplishments for your last job. Did you improve anything greatly while there?

	<TEXT> While the implementation itself may be proprietary, the concepts themselves are likely not. This seems common, especially in companies working on enterprise-level projects.

As long as you aren't stuck in maintenance mode (ie: not adding anything new, and not learning anything new about the projects) I don't think it'll do much to limit your career growth potential. I would suggest keeping yourself busy with side-projects wherever you can, just so you don't fall into a rut of not being motivated to learn anything new.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think part of the reason ageism exists is because unlike the case with young hires, with older hires there is usually a much longer paper trail and job/performance history. I think a lot of interviewers see an older person's resume and think "they aren't as far along as I think they should be after so many years in the industry", and conversely upon seeing a young person's resume they think "this person has worked a couple of years on satisfying projects, his future is likely very bright"... But the whole comparison is unfair, because the vast majority of tech workers won't accomplish something that is front page worthy in their careers. Yet that does not mean they aren't extremely good workers to have by your side. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The FDA allows "compassionate care" use of previously unapproved treatments if it has a chance of improving the quality of life of someone who has a severely degraded quality of life or outlook. It's risky to drug manufacturers however, because if they attempt to treat patients too early, before doses/tolerance/safety are worked out in phased population studies, there is a chance it could make a patient's condition worse or even kill them. Such an event can put a real black mark on their ability to continue research and get approval in the future. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You would have been close to the recommended maximum payload for sure. Looking at your truck's specs its bed is 4.8ft long (usable space), 56 inches wide, and has a depth of 18 inches. Subtracting 4 cubic feet for the wheel wells (it's likely more), and 2 cubic feet for the unused space on top we come out to about exactly 1 cubic yard. Since your soil looks dry and also uncompacted it's probably a few hundred less than the typical 2,000 lb for 1 cubic yard estimate.

Your truck's manufacturer lists a max recommended cargo payload of around 1400lb, which is likely very conservative (because lawsuits). 

With the weight being evenly distributed across the bed there shouldn't be any extreme stress on one particular point unless you're cruising around sharp corners at 30 MPH. 

When I lived/worked on a farm we would regularly exceed max payload specs as long as we kept the weight uniform and drove carefully. We never had any mechanical issues related to weight, and I don't suspect you have anything to worry about either. But I wouldn't recommend packing it down or taking wet soil and filling it to the top =) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Then we should take those people out of the system with today's economics if we want to maintain a stable world. Our efficiency and automation is exploding, and so is our population... It's destined for disaster in the long term, and something will have to change, our economy is ripe for change, but nobody wants to be the first to do it, and I don't blame them. I think we'll start undergoing an evolutionary step in the way we work and function as a society. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Most of the process of 'cooking' the food at places like McDonald's is automated, but they still use people to move it along those steps and put it all together in the end. Those people likely won't be going away anytime soon.

Eventually they likely will, but there is a lot of regulation needing to be defined and cleared up before completely automated food (no humans preparing the food in the restaurant)  becomes a reality. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Seeing the lake 22 feet below it's regular surface would be an interesting sight for sure...

The locks raise the water level by ~20 feet so to lose all of that would imply there was almost no inflow at all. Is that expected? If so does anyone know if water restrictions are planned to maintain the Cedar River flows? I've lived here for about 10 years and there haven't been any water restrictions during that period, are watering restrictions super rare in this area?

	<TEXT> I remember reading somewhere that 2015 already has more units approved for construction than all of 2014 (which was already an active year). The boom is happening, but it's nowhere near enough to bring prices down. Seattle is now estimated to be adding nearly 30k people to its population each year, but suburbs are of course adding many more than that so demand for housing in the city is continuing to rapidly rise and likely will for a long time in the future.

Builders have every incentive to build right now, and I think they are building as fast as they can. There is just such an influx of people wanting to move to Seattle there is no way they can keep up with their current staffing and building capabilities. I'm not sure what more the city of Seattle can do to increase construction. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I know it is likely unethical, but is it actually illegal if there are no investors and the company is private? It's not for tax purposes either, but simply because due to the nature of the business a higher  previous customer count is incredibly crucial to gaining more customers.

For example, say I start a security system company. If I were to say "More installations than any other security provider!", is that illegal if it is not true? Just to clarify, I'm not asking about ethics here but rather the legality of it. </TEXT>
