	<TEXT> Only if you've supped the Tory Koolaid - the claim relies on parsing the IMFs economic language carefully.

- China grew faster than the UK in 2014 but it remains classified as a 'developing' economy despite being four times larger than the UK economy. 7.4% growth.

- India also grew faster than the UK but, despite being a top 10 global economy, is not classified by the IMF as a 'major' economy. 5.4% growth.

- Productivity remains lower than 2007, unprecedented since the war.

- The growth we're seeing is mainly down to cheap labour driven by migration and stalled wage growth. 

- Unemployment is falling overall but the new jobs are at the very bottom end of the pay-scale. 

- US growth is forecast at 3.1% this year, and will certainly overtake the UK, just as it has in the past.

- Our [Real GDP growth](http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.KD.ZG?order=wbapi_data_value_2014+wbapi_data_value+wbapi_data_value-last sort=desc) rate is 3.20 or 97th in the world. India and China are at 7.4, and we're being outpaced by Ecuador and Malaysia. 

- We are not even in the top [20 fastest growing economies](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-25/the-20-fastest-growing-economies-this-year) worldwide. We're being beaten by Poland!

- And we're not even the fastest growing G20 nation, but we are the fastest growing G7 nation for 2014 alone.

- Our [global competitiveness](http://www.weforum.org/reports/global-competitiveness-report-2014-2015) ranking is woeful, we don't even make the innovation list.

So the claim relies on ignoring many countries that most would think of as developed and leaning on percentage growth rather than real GDP growth.

	<TEXT> I doubt it. 

Osborne's policy, and the wider global Conservative movement's thinking, is to say that economic productivity is low because welfare-to-work programs and benefits are too generous. 

Essentially that workers are not properly motivated to work harder and get better paying jobs because they can get, in Conservative thinker's view, 'easy' money via welfare. To their minds this is why the recovery hasn't taken hold, treasury receipts are down and almost all new jobs being created are at the bottom end of the pay-scale - ergo this is why they were unable to meet their deficit reduction targets under the coalition.

The solution, in their view, is the removal of welfare-to-work policies and capping of benefits. This, they believe, will result in a more productive and motivated workforce. The result on the business end will be workers demanding and thereby receiving better paying jobs - which won't happen. Obviously they intend to remove the safety net without ensuring that business meets their pay objectives.

This same view is being expressed by Republicans in the US, Conservatives in Germany, and the UK - Osborne is blazing the trail.

	<TEXT> Yep. Government should step into the middle and ensure workers receive a fair deal, if for no other reason than to avoid the need for policies like tax credits. But political parties main customers are businesses and the wealthy (also because ordinary people are not prepared to donate to them in large enough numbers for it to be meaningful) thus policy is again skewed in favor of big business not the worker. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Its about who the customer is, not the end user or worker. For example Train Operating Companies offer poor customer service to the end user because the main customer of the TOCs is the Government, not the traveller. They agree what service improvements will be made 10 years ahead and won't change that plan no matter how the traveller's needs alter over that decade because it's fixed in the franchise agreement, as are the costs.

Similarly with companies the 'customer' of most companies is their shareholders. In capitalist thinking this is fine because the shareholders should be the public which should provide them with the proper ethical and social motivations, but in the modern globalised economy most voting shareholders are institutional investors and other organisations whose single motive is return on investment and nothing else. There is no motivation to invest in the social fabric of the business or the social fabric of the country in which that business is based.

So we have a widening disconnect between shareholder value and social value. Companies will not pay people more because staff are basically disposable and the shareholders will not countenance any policy which reduces their ROI even if it results in better productivity and innovation in the long term.

Equally the customer of political parties is, again, businesses and wealthy people, and that again skews policy. </TEXT>

There doesn't appear to be anyone who offers Crohn's specific grants but there are many that do offer help for people on low incomes even if many have extraordinarily specific missions (such as helping only people with the surname Forsyth), there are many more like the [Talisman Trust](http://www.talismancharity.org/) and [Newby Trust](http://www.newby-trust.org.uk/) who do help people in poverty, illness, or low income circumsanaces.

PM me if you don't have food.

Edit: If Chron's is anything like the illness I suffer from then the appropriate fourth sector organisation may be able to intervene or provide help to you with benifits so try calling [Chron's and Colitis UK](http://www.crohnsandcolitis.org.uk/about-us/contact-us).

	<TEXT> Read up about the [Burma Railway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burma_Railway) as an example of what was going on.

[During](https://www.forces-war-records.co.uk/prisoners-of-war-of-the-japanese-1939-1945) the World War 2, the Japanese Armed Forces captured nearly 140,000 Allied military personnel (Australia, Canada, Great Britain, India, Netherlands, New Zealand, and the United States) in the Southeast Asia and Pacific areas. They were forced to engage in the hard labour of constructing railways, roads, airfields, etc. to be used by the Japanese Armed Forces in the occupied areas. About 36,000 were transported to the Japanese Mainland to supplement the shortage of the work force, and compelled to work at the coal mines, mines, shipyards, munitions factories, etc. By the time the war was over, a total of more than 30,000 POWs had died from starvation, diseases, and mistreatment within and outside of the Japanese Mainland.

Which is not to say the UK is innocent, we also used 400,000 German POW's as [slave labour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forced_labor_of_Germans_after_World_War_II#United_Kingdom) during and after the war. We didn't, however, starve them to death or beat them - not that this would justify the practice in any way. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The point is that none of the companies I mention are actually 'cheating', thats a moralistic imperative implied by people who think that there is a fixed tax rate for everything that 'should' be paid, these companies are exploiting a loophole generated by a tax system designed for a less globalised world, and one that could easily be closed. 

The companies I mention are not cherry picked for impact, as you suggest, they are companies that either have the entirety of their tax base in the UK or have a trading entity with a tax base in the UK and retail products directly to the public rather than manufacturing goods.

Nintendo is not a direct-to-the-public-retailer, its a wholesaler, and save for its UK online store does not have its tax base in the UK, nor does it have an entity which does.

Reducing Corporation tax is the least helpful mechanism of supporting UK trading businesses as exists, as demonstrated by the government - when they want to provide subsidy to an industry they almost always do it through VAT - for example the print media receives 1.2 billion a year in zero rated VAT, similarly oil exploration to the tune of 400 million a year.

Even the 8% reduction in corporation tax made very little impact on my business or the size of its bill, but the flat rate VAT Businesses in my sector pay has a huge impact.

As I said, this move was PR. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They do - but you're not going to convince me that Starbucks, IKEA, the Daily Mail Group, Sky, Virgin, British Petroleum, Costa Coffee and Nero all have sufficiently low profit margins that they deserve to pay nothing or, proportionately, very little Corporation Tax compared to my business - in this way what Osborne has to say about CT is largely irrelevant to anyone with 1 million plus turnover (meaning they can afford good accountants).

How do you think small business owners feel when we struggle to pay the Corporation Tax bill whilst discovering that Starbucks paid nothing in CT because it structured its worldwide cost base to take a loss in the UK?

Merrill Lynch, for example, structured its cost base to take its entire global loss during the recession through its London office and will pay no tax here for decades as a result.

Essentially what you're engaging in here is pedantry. My complaint is perfectly understandable and valid. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> TBH the reduction in corporation tax is meaningful only to small businesses and even then experience suggests it won't do that much, but it sounds good when announced at the budget. 

HMRC often alter the soft rules around what CT applies to as a means of compensating for the headline rate reduction. For example they altered the rules for Directors Loans so they attract a higher rate of CT to compensate for the 8% reduction during the last parliament which resulted in my business paying 1,500 in retroactive taxation.  

Large businesses really only pay some corporation tax to look good, not because they have to. IKEA also has form on [this](http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/21/multinational-firms-tax-ebay-ikea)

My little business with its 10k corporation tax bill often pays more than companies with massive turnovers.

Edit: CT is a tax on profitability and therefore there is a direct relationship to turnover, its also true that the higher your turnover the better accountancy advice you can afford. Whichever way you look at it structuring your global business to take costs in the UK that were incurred outside the UK in order to pay no, or very little tax here, is just wrong and an affront to business owners who do have to pay the full ride.

A 1% reduction in 2017 and a further 1% in 2020 is basically nothing but PR. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The real problem is nobody is listening to a word any other candidate has to say - basically because they have nothing interesting to say.

As one headline suggested this week the tragedy is Corbyn is by far the best leader of those on offer.

If the election showed anything its that the parliamentary party isn't reaching Labour members let alone the wider electorate - Harman's benefits statement and Chuka's response to Corbyn show that.

I'm actually wondering if a party split might be on the cards. Even if it is I'll still support Corbyn. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You've found one example of a difficult bill and are claiming that single example of a contentious vote would have made 5 years of government difficult - you have very thin evidence.

Secondly you're attempting to cast a moral case over a bill in the National Parliament by comparing it to a Scottish Parliament Issue - where is it written that Scottish MPs should agree with MSPs on all issues. Personally the issue is moot MP's are MP's.

Were the result run under List PR for example the result (Lab/Con/Lib) would have been 239/207/140 and all further permutations result in a wide enough majority for the bill to have passed because there would be a proportionate reduction in the votes against. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We're discussing the election result, not intra party politics. Labour had a majority of 355 and this bill passed with 316 votes, 39 Labour MP's rebelling.

Firstly I really don't see how it's important that the bill passed with 'Scottish MP's' as there is no such thing as a 'Scottish MP' only an MP. Secondly how have you calculated that the bill passed with only Scottish votes, and what does that matter?

Had the election result been different the bill would have been approached differently, perhaps the whips would have made more effort to get people on board.

11,000 people decided the election.

By any measure this is the least representative election result the country has seen. Every system of PR shows a coalition or minority government.

	<TEXT> Ok. Try reading this very slowly and outloud - perhaps then it will penetrate.

Not a single fucking point you've made is correct.

Both gas consumption and gas production are falling whilst renewable consumption and production are rising. This is a decadal trend, UK gas production has been falling since 2000. This shows you are wrong.

Your new claim *'My original point, that wind companies, which generate electricity, are not competing with the part of the oil industry which generates gas is accurate.'* is **obviously bollocks** - of course they are fucking competing you moron, they both sell their product to the god damned generation industry - it's the gas producer's main business for the love of god, thats why the production/consumption trends reflect each other. Jesus!

The first paragraph of the report I linked to says this:-

UK Government has implemented massive subsidies to promote exploration and development of risky and unconventional oil and gas
in recent years, including deep-water offshore resources and
shale gas. 

Who the fuck does oil exploration - fucking Santa? - Oil companies.

I've been replying because I've actually been trying to educate you on how this works - you've provided no evidence to back up a single thing you've said whilst vomiting a bunch of semantic crap to pretend you have point. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Exactly what is it you're trying to prove by differentiating Primary Energy production from energy consumption? No matter which set of figures you look at they both show that fossil fuel production is decreasing while renewables are increasing - neither supports your original point - in fact both sets of figures disprove it.

Oil and Gas industry receives *direct* subsidy for exploration totaling 400 million a year out of 1.2 billion. Whatever the hell you've made up above is just nonsense.

	<TEXT> Sorry, but the graph I linked to is the official DECC estimate for Primary Energy Consumption and shows the same trends as production. Once again you're wrong.

Frankly what you've written is so ridiculous I couldn't be bothered to go point by point. However, since you invite it.

You've claimed.

Wind turbines are not competing with massive gas extraction.

Well, they are, as I outlined above on the generation output side they comprise 15% of current generation and that output has risen 13TwH in just three years and renewables will overhaul gas generation output by 2018, gas output has been on the wane since 2000.

The British Geological Survey reports that we've got shale gas reserves in the UK which would put us somewhere between number 3 and number 1 in the world for gas reserves.

Again as I've shown the report claimed no such thing because as little as 10% of that is accessible and they lack confidence in their assessment of the upper number.

That would give us a roughly equal amount of recoverable gas to Iraq's proven reserves

Nowhere near, I mean not even close to that. We have the 24th largest proven reserves in the world Iraq has the 12th. 

You're conflating electricity generation and primary energy production

No I'm not.

firstly, we don't subsidise the oil industry in this country

Yes. [We do](http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/624/media/images/74519000/jpg/_74519696_74519695.jpg). Around [1.2 billion a year in fact](http://www.odi.org/sites/odi.org.uk/files/odi-assets/publications-opinion-files/9245.pdf) and that number is expanding. Actually its the same size as the subsidy received by the print media.

Primary energy production is not the same as electricity production.

Funny that it shows the same trends then.

I don't know why you think primary energy production backs up your case at all, what it actually [shows](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/437455/Energy_Trends_June_2015.pdf) is a continuing downward trend in the production of gas since 2000 and a continuing increase in renewables as I suggested.

the fact that you're conflating the two suggests to me that either you don't really have a firm grasp of what's being talked about, or that you want to intentionally mislead or misdirect people reading your posts in order to further an agenda

	<TEXT> I'm really tired of people being complete dicks about this when discussing it online. Frankly fuck you - there is no need to be insulting.

The comment you've made above is simply garbage. Look at the estimated [primary energy production](http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/624/media/images/71060000/jpg/_71060672_71060671.jpg), over the next few decades where is Gas? Declining to nothing. What is the major future source? Renewables.

As for these *potential* sources being anything close to middle eastern oil reserves you are simply crazy to think that or you didn't actually read the report you're quoting. The extraction costs are barely supported now let alone in the future given the unstable global market prices.

The BGS survey said:

"Estimates of the amount of recoverable gas and the gas resources are variable. It is possible that the shale gas resources in UK are very large. However, despite the size of the resource, the proportion that can be recovered is the critical factor."

Furthermore BGS's OWN estimate was 10% or 130 TCF which is fuck all and basically means it's barely worth the infrastructure spending and subsidy. The paragraph above also suggests they don't have high confidence in their estimate of total reserve which was 822 TCF.

The figure I quoted was Cuadrilla's own estimate which was higher (for PR reasons) than BGS's much more detailed study. </TEXT>

To set that in context Nuclear produces 20% of energy output, Gas 27% and Coal 36%.

Output from fracking is basically zero right now and Cuadrilla estimates it can only access 10-20% of the resource available in some of the fields. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> FOM, and by extension the teams, has 5 sources of revenue. The race fees and the TV money represent 50% each of 1.4 billion of a total of 1.8 billion pre-tax revenue.

So, if you want online streaming you're not going to get it from FOM, you're going to get it from your national broadcaster because providing that would require the renegotiation of every TV rights contract in existence. 

A centralised streaming solution from FOM would also massively devalue the TV rights, meaning there would be little incentive to provide good programming around the races or pay for expert commentators. Furthermore such a devaluation of the TV rights would result in the teams earning less money each year because the streaming revenue would never match the kind of money broadcasters are willing to pay to repackage the product. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No. They offered an 'extra' 8bn over inflation spread across 5 years on top of the 2 billion announced last year, which amounts to an additional 2 billion per year. That makes projected *government* spending in 2020 122 billion, problem is we already have planned *NHS* spending for 2020 at 146.4 billion, and the existing deficit is running around 700 million per year so Osborne actually announced an extra 1.3 billion a year in funding.

The overall funding gap (planned spending vs funding) is 30 billion (6 billion per year) between now and 2020 and the NHS is expected to find 22 billion in 'savings' (i.e. cuts) to close that gap over the same period whilst moving to a 7 day a week staffing model and executing the Stevens Report modernisation programme.

Only way to do this is cut wages at all levels while increasing hours.

What Osborne announced was actually less than a third of the money the NHS needs to operate at current service levels whilst Hunt announced a massive increase in mandated staffing hours. Basically it will translate into a real terms cut because even the chancellor admits finding 22 billion in savings is 'challenging' at best.

	<TEXT> 'Apex Fallacy' is basically an example of trying to shift the argument and sow doubt, following in the well trodden footsteps of creationism, and as an argument is just about as ignorant as the idea that the Earth is 6000 years old.

MRASJWs would like to *assume* that the feminist concept of patriarchy relies on the idea that all men have the same power as those at the top of a given power structure. It doesn't. In feminist thinking a definition of patriarchy is this:-

Patriarchy is an unjust social system that enforces gender roles and is oppressive to both men and women. It includes any social mechanism that evokes male dominance over women. 

Feminism isn't claiming that the men at the top of any given power structure have the same power as all men in that power structure - hence the fundamental idea behind the Apex Fallacy is complete bollocks.

Essentially what you're trying to claim by the use of the term is that feminism's concept of male privilege doesn't acknowledge the suffering of the poor downtrodden men at the bottom of a pyramid of power - who, as they see it, have no power or privilege, therefore there can be no such thing as male privilege or the patriarchy.

The fundamental argument as expressed by Dr. Helen Smith herself in an interview on the topic is this:-

The error in their thinking arises from a collective refusal to acknowledge that the vast majority of male workers toil in the nether regions of our economy. These hordes of men-who make possible feminist lives of leisure-are totally invisible to the harridans who compare women, on aggregate, to the rich and famous alone. Indeed, when judging female progress, juxtaposition is only made with those males at the apex of our status hierarchy. It seems that feminists can discern none but the elite.

Her error in thinking is as obvious as her bias - she is arguing against what *she* sees as the feminist core argument, and her problem is that she doesn't understand that core argument in the slightest. She believes that feminists are elitists and consider only socially powerful men in their thinking and has constructed a nonsense argument against a concept of feminism that she has herself created.

Again this is not the fallacy of composition at all - you would like it to be because that would lend credibility to both your term and argument but it one simply has nothing to do with the other. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The Apex fallacy was coined by a Conservative/Libertarian psychologist in order to refute what she sees as feminism's central argument - lack of equality of representation is lack of power.

Its popular among the men's rights idiots because it was coined by a woman who agrees with their twisted perspective on the world hence it being shipped by MRASJW's all over the place.

It is *not* analogous to the fallacy of composition no matter how hard to try to wish it is so. </TEXT>

Speaking as the owner of that mind (I'm OP)... I thought it uplifting because, after seeing her grandparents die in front of her, a 16 year old had enough self possession to realise help was not on its way and find a way to save herself. It must have been an extraordinarily difficult two days for her.

She's one tough person and that deserves recognition - we should all aspire to such strength of mind when the chips are down.

	<TEXT> I've just submitted my question for the London party leadership hustings:-

Like many members of the party I feel let down by the IndyRef, European, and General Election campaigns. As a party we do not appear to have answers to the big questions facing the country and cannot put up a fight. How will you refocus the party and move us forward?

Because this is how I feel about our policy positions and thus far I'm unconvinced by any of the leadership candidates. Their campaign's seem to be more focussed on party factionalism than any uniting vision for the party much less the country.

What is your question and why? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Easily - they were able to track the last mobile phone signal from the plane but that wasn't enough to pinpoint its location. Without an emergency beacon there would be nothing anyone could do to locate them more precisely. Many planes have one that activates on impact, but either that didn't work or this plane didn't have one.

People have some very fanciful ideas about what phone networks and mobile GPS can achieve in reality. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Several things:-

This happened in Liverpool City Centre at 2am, there can't have been a great deal going on because the officers had time to be concerned with what they suspected might be a *minor* drugs offence - a 'crime' that most City Centre Police would ignore because they're there to deal with public order. 

The general policy is to avoid all but the most egregious offences in order to keep bodies on the street and keep the custody suite manageable in most *busy* town centres.

An arrest would put both officers back at the station for 4 hours while they dealt with the paperwork and if they were at the end of their shift they would get overtime - this was potentially their goal.

Don't disagree that both the officer and guy in question were being dicks, but the officers interest in such interest in such a common transaction and minor offence makes me very suspicious of their motives. There appears to have been no need to handcuff the chap to ask questions either - although we don't know what physical confrontation went on prior to the removal of the suspects phone. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Lovely attitude towards the many Type 1, 1.5, and Type 2 Diabetics who have inherited the disease through their genes - doing nothing to deserve this horrible curse.

Many diabetics of all types will tell you that their Diabetes was preceded by a serious viral infection - and there is a weight of scientific research that supports that view.

I wonder if your wholly ignorant attitude will change when Altzheimers Disease turns out to be [Type 3 Diabetes](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2769828/)?

The overwhelming majority of Diabetics are not, and never have been, overweight. Many Diabetics struggle with their weight after diagnosis because the two main drugs that treat T2, and insulin for T1/1.5's cause weight gain as a side effect.. 

While there is a correlation between [abdominal central obesity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_obesity) and Diabetes, it isn't a causative link, and no other types of obesity are linked to the illness. We still don't fully understand the nature of the link just as we don't fully understand Diabetes or [Metabolic Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_syndrome). 

There are plenty of fat people who are not diabetic, even in old age, and plenty of thin people who become Diabetic so your hypothesis that Diabetes is the fault of the person, inferring that it is a disease of overeating, is simply false.

	<TEXT> IMO talk of Manor not racing next year is just overblown cynicism and misunderstands the facts. 

The team's losses are down to 4.7 million from over 57 million the previous year while revenue is up to 60 million. The 2014 prize money they are due to receive does not equate to a sensible reason for Stephen Fitzpatrick to fund the team and he has committed to at least 12 months further funding (until June next year). In short they've survived the crisis and can now try and rebuild the team.

They're gaining sponsors, surprisingly Mehri isn't a pay driver, and they had a legitimate shot a points at Silverstone - its going to take at least two years but they're getting there. </TEXT>

All the new buildings are boring bordering on ugly or completely mad! </TEXT>

Cue discussion on cost caps: They don't work because any team can form and fund an outside company to develop tech and then sell it to the team for a peppercorn amount - the FIA cannot oversee the teams to the required extent that would prove this is happening or to prevent it happening. See salary caps in any sport. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There isn't anything wrong with radio communications and it's very hard to know whats going on with a modern car without information on whats happening with the tyres. Doing something like this will have three immediate effects:-

- The team *really* will make the cars easier to drive because there is only so much one person can do behind the wheel and you can't make the car work without knowing the tyre temps.
- The teams will change the tyre specs to make life easier for the drivers.
- The teams will just furnish the information now delivered over the radio in the cockpit displays.

Basically all of this is down to the fact that fans, at last, can hear some of whats happening on the radio (and has been happening since radios went in to F1) and in frustration are using that increased knowledge to draw spurious conclusions.

For the millionth time fans in this sub say the golden eras of F1 are the 80s and 00's and those are periods where the sport was a dictatorship and there were no limits on radio messages. This kind of information being delivered to the drivers isn't new or any kind of problem. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Uswitch is little more than fancy classified ads - their top recommendations are paid for promotional spots. 

MSE used to be good but the banks and energy companies are manipulating the results using their referral schemes (which is how MSE makes money). Basically they only allow the sites to advertise certain things which limits the possible recommendations.

You rely on the energy company for the data that makes these sites work, but they use estimated billing to inflate the figures which limits the recommended tariffs further.

Look into the business model that underlies this system. It's basically predatory. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> PSA: Update on tube strike: No service from 6pm Wednesday until early Friday morning. Disruption expected Friday </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-07-07 19:55:15 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> 
The ASLEF, RMT, Unite and TSSA unions are currently planning strike action, affecting Tube services. If this goes ahead, we expect the following: 

Wednesday 8 July
Tube services will stop running at around 18:00, so please complete any Tube journeys by that time. Services are expected to be exceptionally busy between 16:00 and 18:00. Please travel earlier if you can and allow more time for your journey. 

Thursday 9 July
There will be no Tube service all day. Extra bus and river services will run. Other public transport and roads will be much busier than usual, especially during peak hours. Please travel outside the peak times if you can. 

Friday 10 July
There may be some disruption during the morning as services resume. 

Staff on the bus network, the DLR, London Overground, TfL Rail, Trams, river services, Emirates Air Line and Santander Cycles are not on strike. There is separate strike action by the RMT on First Great Western services from Thursday 9 July for 48-hours. As always, we advise you to check with your train operator or national rail enquiries. All of these services are expected to be much busier than usual.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Really no - the supposed theory behind utility privatisation was that the companies through being more efficient would yield savings and these would be passed on to the consumer. They would also be pressured by free market competition into providing stable and competitive pricing rather than price gouging - but of course the economies of scale to allow this to happen didn't exist in the market as it was privitised.

In fact what happened is that the privatised companies were conglomerated by large european utility companies into near monopolies and, as there was virtually no real money in the consumer energy market, all became vertically integrated (owning generation as well as supply). They were successful in their efforts to craft legislation that benefited them because as both the supplier and generator the government was utterly beholden to them for a functioning energy market, so there is essentially no competition.

Ultimately privatisation made the government accounts look good for a brief period and the public was instead bilked for more money from its own pocket book rather than the government's. The Tory governments bathed themselves in their smug free market glow - but as usual the public paid nasally - the government still pays for the distribution infrastructure via our taxes, the public pays more than it should for energy. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 70% of all consumers, regardless of switching, paid more than they should have - basically the market is dysfunctional and operates to the benefit of the businesses, not the consumers.

In order to obtain the 'best' (whatever that actually means) deal you *have* to move every 12 months and you are entirely reliant on third party meta business for information on what is or isn't the best deal. Those third party businesses don't operate to the benefit of the consumer because their income stream is dependent on referral or product placement fees from the businesses they recommend.

At no stage in any of this is the consumer actually the customer, so the market responds to the needs of government and businesses, not the consumer.

Same problem in the rail industry - government is the customer not the end user. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Beginning in September, about 40 community meetings will be held across Australia, possibly culminating in a national convention. The aim is to reach consensus on precisely how the constitution should be changed, and to agree a question to be put to the electorate in 2017. Even Aboriginal leaders, though, are divided on issues such as whether a clause outlawing racial discrimination should be written into the document.

It would seem so, or at least there is a process in place that will hopefully lead to a referendum securing the double majority needed to change the constitution. </TEXT>
