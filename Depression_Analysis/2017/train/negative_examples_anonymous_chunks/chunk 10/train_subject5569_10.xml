	<TEXT> I just started reading Wool Omnibus Edition yesterday but really picked it up this afternoon.  It had been in my Kindle queue for a while and I travelled a bit recently so ended up grabbing it.  Talk about a roller coaster.  I'm not sure I can continue reading it.  Not sure if I'm hormonal right now but the first 60 pages had me bawling my eyes out.  Never had this reaction to literature before.  Ugh.  *deep breaths* </TEXT>

You seem very angry - I'm guessing it was jealousy or frustration that drove what you wrote.  Becoming who you're meant to be takes time.  It's quite obvious OP did a ton of work over at least two years to get to where she is today.  You will get there too, but you need to apply a little more patience.

	<TEXT> I learned something today that I wanted to share with you all.  When I was in college I was out and proud.  I knew I was gay and that was that.  Then I fell in love with a woman and thought maybe that wasn't that.  Since then, and this is nearly 13 years, I've dated men and women, and I've been single, but I've identified as bi.  I've been in and out of the "scene".  I've felt good and bad about myself, and I've been warm and cold when it comes to wanting friends.  

Today I went to DC Pride and I feel like I recharged my batteries.  I've been neglecting a part of myself that used to be very important, and this subreddit and the people I've met through it have, really, brought me back to life.  So thanks.  And let your flag, freak or otherwise, fly. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks!  I had wanted something different than the usual flat black.  The one hint I can offer is that the metallizer is like a must of metal particles - it can't really be sprayed in the same manner as normal dip.  I did three very quick swipes per wheel.  It also gets everywhere so if it's windy...Be prepared for your car to look like a faerie exploded nearby. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes, it sure does.  From my logged in account or on the app on my phone I can see individual mile times and it gives a profile at any given moment my pace etc.  However I've found on the IP6+ that Strava is kinda wonky.  I have been using MapMyWalk recently as it doesn't have any issues (nor do any other GPS apps I have; just Strava). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Your call.  I've seen lots of Mustang and WRX comparisons on a cost basis but they're never favorable from a driving dynamics perspective.  One quick example...Google has toooons more...

Oversteer isn't the only thing the 86 platform is capable of.

"But Ford, unlike Tesla, isnt opening up the patents for free. You have to pay Ford to license them." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You know, that song, "I Kissed a Girl (and I Liked It)" came on Pride Radio the other day and I was listening to it and it's not a very positive song as these things go...Yes, I'm taking these lines out of context but still:

"I kissed a girl just to try it...It felt so wrong..."
"It's not what good girls do, not how they should behave."

It's not wrong, it has nothing to do with being good or bad...I know that in the context of the song she's talking about it being "taboo" but still. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Eight and a half years?  Wow dude (I'm assuming dude).  That's a long time to keep a secret.  You were probably all psyched up for one or two different potential mind blowing reactions and when she was just "that's nice dear, I love you; please pass the salt" you didn't know what to do with yourself.  Props for finally being honest with the person you share your life with though.  They're always the hardest when they ought to be the easiest.  Funny huh?  I made it a point a long time ago to basically "come out" on the first date...My current (and likely final; going to follow Beyonc's advice one of these days...) girlfriend embraces it completely.  Hell - she'd watch if I'd let her (not that we have an open relationship nor do I believe in that sort of thing but it's a fantasy of hers).  And hey, if you can be someone's fantasy then that's pretty awesome ;) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> YES!!! I actually made a forum post about this years ago (before there was a reddit) and no one knew what I was talking about.  I have experienced this for years - actually, as long as I can remember.  It's like someone flips a switch and that ear is deaf - which is why the tinnitus sounds so loud suddenly (that's why the tinnitus gets loud - because it's always partially masked by environmental sounds).  For me it can happen in either ear and it usually happens several times a week.  Sometimes more often.  Doesn't seem to relate to anything in my life - diet, exercise, stress, etc. </TEXT>
