	<TEXT> I already try to talk to her, in my experience, time can heal you but can also drag you down very fast. This is something I want to prevent at all cost. I really do hope it's just a phase and she'll snap out of it.

I drove home for the night so we could have dinner and he seems allright, laughing from time to time and making jokes so I'm carefully hopefull :)

And glad to hear that you seems to do allright, I doubt I can make you a whole lot better but if it's any help, I have tough about you, that stranger from Reddit, quite a few times today and I really do hope you're good! *internet hug* </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi,

Thank you for your response.

I have indeed tought about the fact that it might be possible that she's hiding something. However, I do not think this is the case. She was never the type of person to hide stuff from her family, no matter how embarrassing/painfull.  

Plus, she also says that this is the main reason why she's so confused, she doesn't know why she is feeling so depressed. I believe that it is something she might be unaware of, or something she refuses to face..

I like the quote by your father since it adresses what I think is the root of her problem. Will definitely use this the next time I have a chance to sit down and talk with her about this. Thanks alot!  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Older brother seeking help for my sister. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-06-09 12:14:54 </DATE>

	<TEXT> Hi Reddit,

My little sister (she's 20, but I have 2 and she's the youngest, therefor my little sister) has been diagnosed with depression a couple of weeks ago.

I never saw it coming, she always was the most cheerful one out of our family of 5, has an amazing boyfriend who loves her, has tonnes of friends, popular, beautiful.. You get the picture.
Because of my work, I can't be home often and she's at uni most of the time anyway.

The last time I saw her it really shocked me how sad she looked, the light always visible in her eyes seemed to have faded away, she looked tires, didn't say much..
I went out to dinner with my dad and he told me it has been declining for a while now and I can see that it hurts my parents tremendously to see her suffer like this.

Now, I went trough something simular when I was in uni but got very good at hiding it and eventually got better because I got help and decided what was worth obsessing over and what not.

I'm afraid that she will not have this strenght, she never had any major troubles in her life and I can see she's not dealing with this well at all.
She is getting professional help but this can only go so far.

As her older brother, I alwasy felt like she looked up to me so my question now is, what is my best course of action? What do I do or say to help her in any way possible?
Mind you, I'm able to see her or meet up with her from time to time but this is once every 2 weeks max.

I already told her I was in a simular situation, what I did to help myself and how I eventually got out. The big difference between the 2 of us is that I kinda knew what was keeping me down, **she does not know**

Only thing that we can think of is that she sets really high (unrealistic) standards for herself, is perfectionistic and does not handle the stress coming from this very well.

So Reddit, what do and what say?

Thank you so much for helping me, I'm kind of lost and it kills me to see my baby sister like this. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Exactly! Plus, it would remove all the useless searching, just put in an order, decide howmuch you want to pay for it and wait. 

Prices are decided by the players and supply amp;demand.. I would be so happy if they implemented this </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Kendrick Lamar - Good Kid, M.A.A.D. city. It's more than an album, it's a lifestory told in the most fitting way possible

Edit: For anyone familiar with the album, so worth the read: http://www.kanyetothe.com/forum/index.php?topic=313845.0 
It's, in my opinion, a very good interpretation of the album and every song by itself. </TEXT>
