	<TEXT> I was 12, and scared like the title suggests. It was 1994, and my father married the love of his life. I was raised Christian and my Father was thrilled to find out that the 2 houses down neighbor woman was his age, single, and christian too. They met at a neighbors house for a neighborhood wine and cheese party (Sounds silly but this is Portland Oregon and this happens...) He dates her for a year or so then they get married, We go to church and everything's great. When they get married they both decide to keep their own houses and split sleep time between the two. Sweet! I think to myself. I had 2 bedrooms and 2 yards to play in, and now a wonderful little sister.

When Linda was here everything was great! We climbed the trees in the backyards, made perfume for her mother out of summer lavender plants, and went to summer camps and all that usual stuff. When she left to go back to her fathers house in Florida after summer ended, things would always turn dark. The light in the house would seem dimmer, sunlight filtration through the windows would be, I don't know, less like light? One particular night I was in "my room" at my step mothers, in the basement also know as the guest room. Do you know what it's like to bite into a real OREO cookie and how familiar and wonderful it tastes? Then eat a Safeway (West coast food store chain) knock off OREO and you can absolutely tell something is different? That is particularly what this night felt like. I was a fan of Archie comics, I was allowed to read until 10 PM on school nights. I was fully into a new Archie double digest when my flipper clock (Anyone over 30 knows what those are) said 10 PM. 

So being the always eager to please youth that I was, I set my comic down and pulled the string on my lamp and made the room dark for sleep. As many kids do, I gave myself a few minutes to reflect and think, I could not get in trouble for being alone with my thoughts, That was my time. About a minute into my contemplation's of the day, week, or whatever, I heard wind. Slow at first, then steadily picking up in sound. I could not feel it necessarily but I could hear it. I thought, "Fine!" no big deal. But when the wind noise stopped with a sudden veracity, followed by a brief audible "Hshhhh"  I got a little scared, hell, I was 12.

As all this is sinking in (Remember it's summer time and outside it's like 65.) I could visibly see my breath, Puff, puff, puff... I reached my  hand into the complete darkness. A blueish white glow surrounded my splayed fingers and The temperature I felt was cooler than a freezer, the light seemed to be flowing around my fingers like petting a passing furry animal, then it was like there was a vacuum that seemed to pull the anomaly into the abyss directly away from my outstretched hand. Wide eyed and scared, I managed to pull the cord on my night light, scared as to what I might see, I still managed to. The lights came on, and the room looked normal. the temperature slowly over the course of a few minutes returned to normal. 

I told nothing of my experience to anyone for a year or so. In 8th grade when I was 13, we were assigned to write a scary story for Halloween. I figured it had been long enough and I was not so frightened by the experience I would write about it. My teacher was really impressed with the imagery I used with words in the story, she read it to the whole class. Everyone told me it was a really good story. I had one friend I trusted. I told him it was true and he looked at me sideways and laughed and said " Sure Mike!" Later I come to find out my stepmother, after the divorce from my very Christian father, was a Luciferian. A tie maybe? I don't know. It is the most real supernatural experience I have personally ever had.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you have some bitcoin and some a-hole breaks in and steals your laptop/PC with your main storage wallet you are probably going to notice a computer is gone. The 64 key password will probably take some time to hack being the said a-hole even knows what the f*@k bitcoin is. In the mean time you restore your wallet (From an offsite USB) or whatever, transfer to an alternate wallet and change the encryption password.

	<TEXT> I have never been hacked, 64 key encryption on my Bitcoin core PC wallet. I have mined on the same PC as my wallet... since 2011. Max coin has been 22 BTC. Why is it that people have been hacked? I have a pc that is only online when I do my transactions that hold my coins. Mining for me now and for the last year is unprofitable. Am I wrong in suggesting that you purchase coins on one.. Boot "ye old PC" and transfer real quick, wait for confirmation and then shut down "ye old PC"? Its worked for me maybe you have an old laptop and only use it for BTC stuff. </TEXT>

If heat was a problem after my stress test I would have ordered a higher  CFM fan. Max temp at full 1080p for 2 hours it only got to 66 degrees f. With an ambient temp of 65 f. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I brew often(30 or so gallons last year), My highest yield was 10% ABV. A delicious Rye IPA. From what I understand more sugar more potential alcohol. [This guy](http://byo.com/boiling/item/51-21-alcohol-all-grain-beer) has a 21.4 ABV by his readings and he uses some pretty wonky methods I am not familiar with (I am not an aficionado) But it seems he pumps o2 into the fermentor with a welding tank... This is neat to me. I might have to try a super ABV beer for fun. </TEXT>
