	<TEXT> So what if Kanye did it, Kanye is a bell as well but doesn't claim to be a comedian.

Paul Kaye has done it, Sacha Baron Cohen has done it plus more I can't think of off the top of my head </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ran out with city players on a warm up, jumped in photos with the England team jetting off, stormed the stage at Glastonbury when Kanye was playing and I'm sure there are others that I'm forgetting. All those he was chastised for as it was twattish, he's done the same here but he's been lucky that's why I said he lucked out that everyone is saying it's funny. If it wasn't blatter everyone would just call him a bell per usual like he is. He's also the "star" of one of the worst shows ever produced called The Lee Nelson Show </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Because he lucked out, he has done several things like this over the last couple of years and its twattish, it's just that us football fans have been desperate for something, anything which is why this is seen as funny. He is at the very heart of it an unfunny attention seeking bell and one good thing doesn't stop the rest of them being shit. Broken clock etc </TEXT>

	<TEXT> He been trying this for ages, sneaking into the photo with the England team jetting off for Brazil, getting on stage with Kanye at Glastonbury. He's a prick, he's ladbible in comedy form. Genuinely hope he gets locked away in a Fifa gulag hidden under the Swiss mountains forever </TEXT>
