	<TEXT> A former friend of mine showed up at my house around 3:30am demanding I give his damn dog back.  He was yelling and cursing so loud the neighbors came outside.  He ripped the railing off my porch and the shutter from a front window because I wouldn't let him inside to get his dog.  I couldn't convince him to leave, so I called another friend to come get him, which he did.  I didn't have his dog because he never had one to begin with.  Cocaine. </TEXT>

What a harsh video.  If this is how he controls a 110 lb. drunk girl maybe he needs to rethink his effectiveness as a police officer. </TEXT>
