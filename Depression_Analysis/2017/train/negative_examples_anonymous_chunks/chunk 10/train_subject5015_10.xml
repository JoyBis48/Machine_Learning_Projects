	<TEXT> I admit I did misinterpret the article, only because I didn't actually read the tweets, maybe you can see how the article coupled with it's comments makes it seem serious. I'll take out the part in my comment about the article being serious.

On the subject of the 'comments', I wasn't talking about the tweets. It's extremely obvious to anyone that understands a laughing emoticon that they find it funny, and if I had actually read them and seen checked their names against the authors then I wouldn't have said that the article was taking it seriously.

What I was talking about: http://gyazo.com/7b8791a9050585d904fb622d1d21ada9 The very first and most liked of the article comments is about race culture and Blair's 'so called labour government.

Please dude, take a chill pill next time and scroll down the page a little more. Maybe re read someones post and the article they're talking about before calling them an idiot. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The Crone also said she would kill Geralt, which she didn't. Crone's were wrong about a lot of things. I doubt they thought they would all be killed by Geralt/Ciri, or that  Geralt would betray them and release the children (what I did). 

Also if you also look in the quest log for the final quest it say something to the effect of "well as for Geralt, that's another story.". Dandelion also dosen't say anything about Yen,Triss, etc (at least in my ending), he only speaks of the political situation. I don't think that's really implying anything.

I'm not saying he didn't kill himself, it's definitely possible. I just think CDPR wanted it to be open to interpretation. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sounds like a better ending than mine.

Ciri goes into a portal created by the Elven mage, crosses into another world and then walks into the White Frost, she has some flashbacks of Geralt and her (now that i think about these were all from the last 'chapter', like me giving her the necklace instead of burning down the laboratory, i assume all these event flashbacks are the ones that caused this specific ending). Then the Frost in Geralts world stops, so I assume she stopped it successfully. Don't know if she escaped it like she did in another ending or what.

After this Geralt goes to the Crone's house, kills the remaining Crone and gets Vesimirs wolf medallion. He then kneels inside the house, clutching the medallion. You see a ton of monsters approaching the house, and then it fades to black. No idea if he was sad enough to let them kill him or what. </TEXT>

In my ending, we get to know a bit about the political situation, but I can't really say I care about that that much. In terms of the characters, the *only* thing we know is that Geralt and Ciri may or may have not died. No idea what happened to any of the other characters. Was really let down. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah I don't even know what happened to Ciri. Pretty much a given that she died, though. And even Geralt, last we know in my ending he was just sitting in the Crone's house, clutching Ciri's medallion, with tons of monsters approaching. Don't even know if he let them kill him or if he killed them and got out. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Got the ending where she sacrifices herself to stop the Frost. Can't believe I don't get to know how the other characters reacted and what happened to them....wondering if this is just a CDPR fuck up (maybe they ran out of time like suggested below?) or if there's something im missing? On the other hand, I feel like this is one of the morally 'better' endings, as Ciri is saving an entire planet.

Also, did anyone find the boss fight with Eredin/Other Wild Hunt General really really easy? Like each one of his hits only took away about 1/20th of my healthbar, and each of my Quen signs absorbed two of his hits. I'm 99% sure even the wild hunt dogs were doing more damage to me.

I was using full master ursine armor/sword, specc'd mostly into the red skill tree, at around lvl34.

I just can't imagine why they wouldn't tell us what happened to the other characters (in this and other endings). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Those are all completely different games. With different engines, different amount of calculations running in the background, different gameplay goals, different core mechanics, different art styles etc etc etc. Not to mention GTA had a 265$million budget and their game still takes 5 minutes to load into multiplayer, compared to DayZ which was a free mod (initially) and is the most tense gameplay experience i've ever had.. Saying shit like that makes it sound like you have no idea what you're talking about OR like you're baiting. </TEXT>
