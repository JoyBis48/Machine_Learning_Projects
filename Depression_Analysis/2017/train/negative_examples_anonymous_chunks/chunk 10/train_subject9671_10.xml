	<TEXT> Hi guys - do Etihad offer a fragile baggage service? I remember a few years ago my little brother bought a digeridoo in Oz and BA had a designated check-in area for it as it was fragile...it got it's own special bubble wrapping and careful handling - do Etihad operate the same service?

If so does anyone know the cost (whether it's based on size, weight or whatever)? Or can direct me to the part of their website that has these prices? I can't find it myself!

Thanks to any and all! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Personally, I think you handled this well. Unfortunately, there are those of our gender who (as we so regularly see on this sub) can't take rejection, and either backpedal immediately (like your example here) or go straight on the offensive. Keep on sticking to your point- it's the right thing to do, though by his reaction I think it might turn more negative if he doesn't bend his mindset more. Good luck! </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Cheap holidays from Sydney? </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hey all,

We'll be going from Sydney, on or around the 23rd of September this year, there are two of us flying, and we'd like as much included as possible (all inclusive would be the best obviously).

I've had a look at various holiday package websites, but none of them allow you to search from a departing location without a specific destination. Cruises are allowable, but unfortunately they're pretty expensive.

Ideally we'd like something in the region of $500 total if possible. We've got a weeks gap in our itinerary that we need to fill, so any suggestions (links would be even better if you have them) would be helpful thanks! </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Australian Tax Return Help? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-06-06 11:29:54 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hey all,

My girlfriend and I have been living and working in Australia on a working holiday visa since November; we are currently working on a farm, and will be until the end of July.

Our question is, for the tax period that we'll be working throughout July, do we have to wait until next July (the end of the new tax year) to apply for the tax return, or can we do it once we've left the country (we're going home in November)?

Hope someone can help advise us! </TEXT>

Will try google translate to see if it gets the point across, and if not I'll speak to the Korean guy who runs our hostel- he might not want to get involved in inter-guest issues, but he may have to! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I know it isn't specifically a Korean issue, but they have trouble with English as it is, and I didn't want to confront them without knowing if just coming out and saying it would be ruder than saying it in a certain way (IDK).

I agree - the food labelling is just because we're already riled about the other stuff; as I said, the only reason that it feels really insulting at all is because they seemed to have suddenly decided to do it, we've lived for six weeks together without it being a problem *shrugs*.

We only do our washing once a week, in one big load, whereas they wash a small amount every single day - once again they've changed their behavior. The first couple of weeks, on the one day that we washed our stuff and used the clothes line and rack, they'd hang their small load from the bunk bed in their room and/or the dining room chairs - but now they just move our wet stuff into a pile. It boils down to the same as the music - the lack of consideration.

Thanks for the feedback both of you- I'll see if I can explain to them how it is from our point of view. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi everyone, not sure if this is the right place to post, if not please advise where to go!

We (my girlfriend and I) are currently living in a hostel-owned house with an Italian guy and a Korean couple.

We've managed to explain issues of shower usage to them, so that we all can have hot showers after working on farms, but there are still little issues cropping up here and there.

The main two are personal property and respect - for example we got up this morning and started listening to some low-level music in the living room (quite late in the morning, so not disturbing anyone by any means); the lady of the couple came down to start cooking lunch (the kitchen/living room is one big room) and put a tv show or video on on her phone and turned up the volume loud enough to smother our music. Similarly they put on their own music when they come down to cook or just sit in the living room and turn it up to cover our own without asking us to turn ours off or if we mind - there seems to be no form of respect or consideration in this respect.

The other is to do with washing - we have to share our drying rack and washing line outside, and they wash their clothes without checking the availability of the drying facilities - if we have clothes out when their washing finishes, they'll pile it up on one end of the drying rack, even if its still wet, to hang theirs out instead. Again there seems to be no consideration for others.

A smaller issue is labelling - we've lived in the same house for almost two months now, and two weeks ago the Korean couple suddenly started writing their name on EVERYTHING they own food-wise. The Italian always eats out, and doesn't bring any food home with him, and my girlfriend and I have plenty of our own food and have never used anything of theirs. As I said it's a small issue, but it seems insulting almost, as if they expect us to take their food (we all have our own cupboards/fridge/freezer shelves, so there's no chance of accidentally taking something not belonging to us).

Sorry for the rant; as I said, what's the best way to approach them about these problems? As they seem to have no clue that they as people can affect others (though seemingly they're very aware that we can affect them). Hope someone can help! </TEXT>
