	<TEXT> I travel about 175-225 days a year for work while keeping my health. It's not easy but my rule is,  decent filling breakfast (yogurts,  fruit,  etc).  Lunch is usually provided for me,  but keep it small. For dinner never a starter or desert. Just a main course and a coffee. Pick something light. 

Exercise wise: body weight training for at least 30 minutes a day,  if the hotel has a gym,  use it. I also go for a 30 minute run every morning before the start of the day (depending on location,  if it's a safe place I am visiting I will go for a run,  if not I will do it in the hotel gym,  if no gym available,  no run,  but 30 minutes of jump robe in the hotel room or garden). 

Take it easy with alcohol. Better yet,  don't drink during weekdays (hard in some cultures).  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> On that note. Many starting keto people don't eat enough fibres early on. 

Don't try to compensate by eating nearly 300 grams of linseed in one go.

	<TEXT> 3 years ago I ate at Jiro. Made reservations 3 months before and postponed my trip a week to make it happen as fine dining is my number 1 hobby and I aim at at least 2 Michelin stars a month (2*1 or 1*2) and know quite about about good food. 

I would like to point out that almost all of the quality is from his son. Jiro does some QA but that's about it. Honestly I believe his son will take it to a higher level when Jiro steps back completely. Jiro did the first 25 miles of his sushi marathon,  but his son did the final stretch. 

If you aspire to eat there bring between 400 and 600 USD a person (depending on the exchange rate)  and be aware that this is not a place where you sit down for hours. It's pretty much in and out. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When I was 15 there hardly was any Internet. Most of us didn't have a cell phone. Doing stupid shit would be categorised as "boys being boys". 

Nowadays you do something stupid you get in trouble with the law,  it's shared world wide and everyone can see your behaviour,  not just a select group of friends. Legends were born in that time. 


Being 15 in this day and age must suck.  </TEXT>
