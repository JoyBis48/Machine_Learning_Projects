	<TEXT> [It's not that subjective] (https://bouldercolorado.gov/newsroom/best-of-boulder-community-honors). 
The past decade was fallout of the sexual assault allegations, no names were ever named and nothing criminal ever became of it. The school cracked down on recruit visits so CU didn't get good recruits. The last AD didn't care about sports so he let everything get out dated. Then comes Rick George who makes it a priority. The future is bright for CU football. I could list a million changes and reasons but you've got your mind made up  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They would want to get the knife away from him. If he won't out the knife down, they must do it themselves. Tazer could work but if ineffective then he slices his own throat of still has a knife. Try to take it with your bare hands and he will kill himself or turn the knife in officers. Shooting is the only sure way to get the knife away if he won't cooperate. 
If she didn't call the cops he still could've sliced his throat and no one would be there to stop bleeding which would only even be possible if it wasnt arterial bleeding. 
Calling the cops was the only real chance the guy had. She regrets it because she blames cops for the death. If he would've been cooperative or not suicidal then he would be alive. It's a coping mechanism of grief to blame someone other than the deceased.  </TEXT>
