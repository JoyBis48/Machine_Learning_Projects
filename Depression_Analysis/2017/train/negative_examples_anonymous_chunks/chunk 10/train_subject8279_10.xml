	<TEXT> Maybe someone can enlighten me please,  Is wage "appropriately" adjusted to our current inflation? If minimum is $15, does that also mean the current minimum wage for jobs that require experience and education such as,  a nurse for example, need to rise as well? Facts , or opinions based on facts would be nice.  I'm just trying to explore through dialogue.  </TEXT>
