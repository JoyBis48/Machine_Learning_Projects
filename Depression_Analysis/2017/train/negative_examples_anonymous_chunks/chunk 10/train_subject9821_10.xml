	<TEXT> There is a theory on /r/fantheories that makes a strong case that Robin is actually Jokers son. So heres what i suggest





Robin is fighting crime keeping Gotham in order. Bruce and cat woman living happy in london or where ever. Robin eventually finds out his dad is the Joker. Kills him at his trial, that way we never hear the joker so you could cast a lookalike. Robin then takes a turn for the worse, no longer being able to mask the anger hes always had inside, the anger he tells Bruce about.





He forces Batman and catwomans hand. They come back to save Gotham. After a long struggle, Robin kills Batman. Then an epic battle between robin and catwoman transpires. Catwoman wins,barely, and returns to London. Where in the final scene we see her nursing a young boy, bruce jr.

	<TEXT> A shame you dont see more in the story of Avatar. An avid film fan you seem to be, there is so much more than eye candy. It highlights the flaws of the human race, it shows a world that has evolved without technology, has a wonderful love story, great characters in the brainy female scientist, hardenered war Captain, and the handicapped rebel. Makes powerful statements on war and the field of conscinoues. But if you cant see its more than eye candy i feel sorry for you as its such a joy.




How can the setting not be more original? Pandora is an orignal world. Cmon now. The theme and conflict in TWBB are very much the same as the Godfather and endless movies about rise to power. The characters and acting(didnt mention) are better but one film has DDL one doesnt so that shuts the case on those 2 aspects.




Again i love TWBB, but wish you could see more in Avatar. People tend to get lost in the CGI and not focus on the wonderful story or concepts. Sling blade doesnt even come close imo  </TEXT>

I love TWBB, i think DDL acting is the best ive seen in many years. But Avatar is more bold exciting and has a less dark feel. So you dont have to keep explaing the movie i get it, i love it, its a classic. But to say your opinion has a better case How?? </TEXT>

I disagree with you on BBM. Avatars love story prevails over species, race, war, betrayal, and bodies. Not just gender. But you are missing personal opinion here. How can your views and opinion dictate my personal list? How can your opinion of BBM make my opinion of Avatar wrong? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The end speech between Borden and Angier. Angier begins to tell Borden of shooting the first clone but there is a major inconsistency.




Angier is all alone in Teslas' lab seemingly after its been burned down. There is no Tesla or his assistant, as to imply they have already fleed Edisons men. But Edison burns the lab down that night. Only after Tesla flees does Angier have solo use of the machine.





Angier couldnt have gone to the lab alone beforehand, due to the electric fence. Nor do we ever see him there without Teslas company. So he couldnt be there alone beforehand alone and he couldnt be there after the machine was given to him, the lab has been burned down.




There are 3 possibilities. 




1)Ive missed something here and someone can make sense of this inconsistency.(possible although unlikely)





2)Nolan made a mistake.





3)Its a clue Angier is lying in this moment.





Lmk what you all think or what ive missed.




EDIT: i was wrong it does look like the scene is elsewhere than the lab. will leave the post up to rebutt the crazy suggestion there was two machines </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes you do. When you consider yourself right when you are clearly wrong thats a childish thing to do. Its not about your missused burning ship analogy, its about someone coming along and correcting your mistakes. When they do you accept the mistake, learn from it, and move on. You dont hold on to your mistake and now treat it as truth.





This is the way mature people deal with mistakes. But again like a child you want to hold on the notion im "righter" Lol. Unlike me i saw my mistake and said yep i stand corrected, grow up a little and accept the idea you will not always be right, you wont. Even Einstein was wrong, alot. </TEXT>

My point still stands, the older version of The thing much better than the new. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I thought it was great. A nice change for Scorcese as well.





I saw it as Leo was really crazy. His partner was his docter,etc, and it was an attempt to try and cure him. At the end he realizes he is potentially cured but instead of living with the pain hed rather be lobtomized. He says something like, "Live as a murderer or Die a good man." I believe his relapses dealt with him running from the pain of his murdered wife and kids. Thats how i saw it. </TEXT>

Your only response was some bias racist crap that made no sense, and directly reflects the type of mindset whites still have in this country as proof enough AA is nessicary. Mindsets, like yours, will always lean whites like me to support AA as the majority of this country does. Then you come back with i didnt say any thing racist LOL.

	<TEXT> Now your racism is becoming clear. But if AA is stealing all these jobs from whites and hires less qualified minorities why doesnt it show in the numbers?? You see how you are contradicting yourself





Someone has to be a minority someone has to be the majority. Its a technicality you are hanging on, if blacks were the majority AA would apply to whites. Its a number of population of race thing not a color thing. </TEXT>

So if AA is so unfair, why are whites still the least unemployed but most of the population? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No it has to do with minority, yesterday you had no idea it lent itself to women. This country is the most diverse we have to incourage equal opportunities. So 50 years is suppose to even out the 200 years minoritys didnt get to vote work, or were slaves?





If you were to employ every black person in America that would only leave 2% of whites unemployed. Yet with being a majority whites have the least unemployment, hence level the playing field. If we have 100 people 70 are white 30 are black 60 whites are employed only 10 blacks. Thats are country break down, to imply this is level is ignorant and just wrong. And this is with 50 years of AA lol </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Its to level the playing field. Blacks are still the most unemployed, women still make less than 1$ average than males for the same job. This country has only recently given equal rights to these groups, so outside help is needed. This policy has evoked positive change in culture and mindsets. You do realize it has very little to do with race. If whites were the minority it would serve them. Furthermore we are not the only country to adapt this policy.
