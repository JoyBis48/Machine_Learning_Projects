	<TITLE> Help me find a hobby for my dad. </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Hello!
My father is 49 years old and lives at home with his parents due to three suicide attempts.  He has been diagnosed with a mild case of schizophrenia, depression, anxiety, paranoia, and a mild bipolar disorder.  With his latest suicide attempt he had a minor stroke and now has difficulty speaking (slight stutter), and his hands shake.  He used to go bowling twice a week but insists that the people there talk about him and don't like him so he doesn't want to go back.  I am desperately trying to find a hobby for him to add more meaning to his life.  He doesn't like being out in the sun, he doesn't like crowded places, he can read but doesn't remember what he just read, and he doesn't have to motor skills to draw or paint (according to him).  He has a truck and can drive, and he used to go fishing a lot but doesn't want to do that anymore due to being out in the sun.  Please help me brainstorm potential hobbies that would be within his comfort zone!

*note - I am in the military stationed overseas, so spending more time with him isn't an option right now :( </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For example, if a person is laying down and someone asks "what's up?" Is the ceiling still up or is above the person's head up? </TEXT>
