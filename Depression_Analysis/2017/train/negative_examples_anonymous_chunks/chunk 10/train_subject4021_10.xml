	<TEXT> I've been on the sea my entire life you see. But worry not,the story of mine starts with no thunderstorms and ten foot waves splashing the deck of my fathers old catamaran. In fact, we made it through one of those last night just fine! Sure, there were moments when i thought the wind will send me flying over the borders and into a salty death, hell I even almost got my head knocked straight of by a rampaging crate that had gotten loose, only to be saved in the nick of time by my reflexes. My ass I'm too old to be on the ship, bet that must have showed them I can still walk that hard walk and talk that smooth talk, but sure they've been awfully quiet all day today, even going as far as complaining about it being cols every time I strolled around. But enough about that, what's been in the past should be left there, even if it was yesterday.


We got off on a tiny Italian harbor, looking just like the one I grew up in. Well I'll be damned, I said as soon as i got off, those church bells look just like the ones we used to throw rocks at to hear them ring, old Augustino and I! Been a long time since I saw him too, something along the lines of cancer or other bullshit they tell you these days when you go to the doc. None of the boys seemed to care for either what I was rambling about nor all the Innkeepers coming to see how our trip had gone, they just pushed through,shoulders wide and still soaken sailor hats in their hands.


I felt not the rush they did. I was just fine with walking around and taking a look at the masses that had gathered around our ship, as if something on it was different than all the rest that docked here every other day. Why on earth do you people take such a liking in the old lady,sure,she aint no pretty gal, but she knows how to keep her head high in a storm!



All these years and you still havent learned when to shut up?


I turned around towards the ship just in time to see two familiar faces, Augustino and Francesco, both my childhood friends.Sheesh, time sure didnt take a toll on either on them, they both looked as young as I remember them, even Francesko who I heard from some fellow sailors was battling some disease he caught going naughty in places he shouldn't have. Must have also kicked the shit out of it while at that, or at least proved those labcoats were just bullshitting again, judging by his looks.


The fuck are you two doing here?Is this some kind of a reunion I came late to?



Well you certainly are the last one to come Vinnie, but fuck it, you sure did choose a more fun way to go than either of have! Augostino said that through a grin that almost made him choke on his own words.


What do y-


As I have said that, a coffin was dropped from the Ship in front of me, making me realize my reflexes are nowhere near what they used to be. </TEXT>
