	<TEXT> According to Wikipedia, pump-action shotguns are illegal if they hold more than 5 rounds.

I'm not an expert, but in skimming how the Australian gun laws Wiki page, they break things down into different categories, and the higher the category, the more restrictive the regulations on ownership.

Since this is a lever-action gun, I'm guess that allows it to fall under the least restrictive category, which is what has the antis all pissed off, since it's a technical solution to a bureaucratically-induced limitation.

	<TEXT> The old paradigm, says Gross, who has a background in advertising, was keeping certain guns away from all people. (Assault rifles, for example.) The new one, which focuses on background checks, is about keeping all guns away from certain people. (People with criminal records, domestic abusers, the mentally ill.) 

This particular bit of bullshit jumped right out at me. If Dan Gross were the least bit serious about implementing this as a policy stance, the Brady Campaign would be suing the shit out of states and municipalities that have bans on so-called "assault weapons," magazines, and even calling for the feds to repeal GCA '68 and NFA '34.

I also find it highly amusing that the one state-level victory they point to; the background check law in Washington, is not being enforced, and is, by all accounts, being flouted on a continual basis. Yeah, that's a real win there, fella. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The 2 million stat is derived from studies undertaken by criminologist Gary Kleck.

His results are on the high side, but not necessarily unrealistic. Other studies have come up with numbers ranging from 60,000 (from the deeply anti-gun and highly partisan VPC) to 500,000, and 1,500,000.

As for people mistakenly using a gun illegally, this seems to be fairly rare, though I'm not aware of any specific studies. You could probably use the conviction rates of concealed carry permittees as a reasonable proxy.

	<TEXT> The long-term goal here is to spin up a machine designed to feed credulous members of the media gun control talking points while maintaining the cover of using a supposedly "impartial" source.

Think of it as a news media equivalent of the Bloomberg school of public health, but instead of using the public (and reporters') innate trust of the medical establishment, they're using the cover of being a supposedly impartial media source.

I expect that part of the reason for this is that the public has largely figured out that when the mass media quotes organizations like Brady or VPC in a story that they're lacking in credibility.

There was a similar attempt a number of years back where The Joyce Foundation threw money at academics to attempt to re-write historical and legal precedent on the 2nd amendment to redefine it as a "collective right."

Off the top of my head, the most notable academics to help perpetrate this fraud were Cornell West (yes, the Cornell West that had a bit part in The Matrix 2), and Michael Bellesiles, whose book on guns was so fraught with outright fraud that it essentially destroyed his career. </TEXT>

They're helping to fight the draconian laws that were passed there.

Incidentally, would you care to explain why you think someone should be thrown in prison simply for a grip?

I mean, it seems to be kind of cowardly to want to imprison people because of how they hold an object.

The state's response was that it was perfectly legal to have the magazine so long as you only used it with the cartridges that limited the capacity e.g. .458 SOCOM. 

Putting other cartridges in the magazine that would allow you to load more than the legal limit (.223) would result in a fine and a trip top the slammer. 

It's a perfect example of just how insane these laws actually are.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The issue, though, is that trying to separate "gun violence" into it's own special category is, in most cases, disingenuous.

Even if you work from the assumption that passing gun control works, and drives down "gun violence," without actually addressing the underlying issues of that violence, all that happens is that alternate methods of inflicting harm are substituted, with no real effect on the rate of overall violence. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So, out of curiosity, I went back and added up all of the donations to various pro-gun organizations that I've donated to in the names of the various graboids that haunt our hallways, and figured some of you guys would be interested in seeing the breakdown.

So here it is:
CALGUNS Foundation: $10

Second Amendment Foundation: $5

Virginia Citizens' Defense League: $5

The Independence Institute: $5

Students for Concealed Carry: $5

CALGUNS Foundation: $10 (I should have just done the $20 donation and reaped some swag...)

The Independence Institute: $5

Oregon Firearms Federation: $5 (and they sent me a couple stickers!)

Texas State Rifle and Pistol Association: $5

NRA-ILA: $10

Second Amendment Foundation: $5


*Total: $70*

I'd like to thank our resident trolls for enabling me to donate a grand total of $70 to various pro-gun organizations. Until now, I've always just been one of those people who sends off $25 once a year to the NRA and then feels vaguely guilty about not doing more to fight for civil rights.

Because of our pet graboids, I've now donated nearly 3x the amount of an annual NRA membership to various organizations working to advance gun rights, including some small, but deserving groups of people.

The old saying is true. Turns out it truly is better to give than to receive.

	<TEXT> What an idiotic proposal; even by the already drop-dead moronic standards of the average graboid.

Passing this law would be the death knell of the gun control movement, and here's why.

Let's say that this proposal is magically signed into law by Obama next Monday.

By Wednesday afternoon the NRA would spin up a program whereby they'd offer discounted liability insurance to any gun owner who becomes an NRA member*. 

By Friday morning, the NRA would probably have something like 10 million new members.

Two weeks down the road, their ranks would swell to ~30 million members.

A month later, the rolls would probably stabilize at a total of around 50 million new NRA members, making the NRA easily the biggest, best funded, and most cantankerous grassroots organization in United States political history.

The NRA's war chest would swell to record proportions, and not only would we live in a world where every gun control proposal would be utterly eviscerated, and their advocates publicly humiliated, but you'd end up seeing the repeal of every gun control law back to the Sullivan Act.

Sure, it would leave us in a situation where we'd all have to pay an annual fee for some piddly insurance policy**, but that would be a fairly small price to pay in exchange for being able to order a belt-fed grenade launcher via Amazon (Free shipping for Prime Members!).


*Remember, the NRA already has something of an insurance infrastructure already in place, as they insure most shooting ranges, as well as work with a company to offer insurance plans for gun collections.


**After all, the NRA wouldn't work to repeal the law that vaults them into the political stratosphere. </TEXT>

So donate when you can, but don't beat yourself up if you have more important financial obligations to take care of. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Respectfully, I must disagree, especially in this case.

Look at the historical symbolism (going all the way back to General Gadsden and Benjamin Franklin) inherent to using a rattlesnake for a symbol. It's not an animal that goes out of its way to attack; in fact, they're quite content to be left alone, and will typically only strike in self-defense.

Now, compare that to the symbolism that CSGV has added: a bare, human foot attempting to deliberately stomp, to death, an animal that simply wishes to be left alone.

Now, you can argue that this does reflect a facet of humanity, but it's not the "starry-eyed dream version" of humanity you spoke of.

Rather, the facet of humanity CSGV are symbolizing is arguably the worst part of human nature: the drive to dehumanize, outgroup, attack, and kill those who you disagree with. 

This poster isn't a representation of pie-in-the-sky hippy-dippy idealism. It's a representation of a wish to obliterate and kill what they irrationally fear and hate.

The one thing that I find heartening in the whole image is that they were evidently too stupid to bother putting on boots before trying to stomp a poisonous snake to death, which indicates that our foes fly their idiocy and lack of preparation right on their very own flag. </TEXT>

Control of the environment is a theme that shows up over and over again in these sorts of incidents, and frankly, is far more worrisome than whether the perp used a scary black gun or "high capacity" magazines.

All humans make choices based on emotions and feelings at one time or another, and in many cases, an individual may not have the ability or interest to weigh arguments based on logic and reason, and will instead opt to go with a feeling, or gut reaction.

As such, it behooves us to have arguments of all sorts ready to go, be they reasoned, emotional, psychological or sociological.

	<TEXT> Believe it or not, Wired published an article on the AR15, and it's a pretty decent primer on why the gun is so popular.

http://www.wired.com/2013/02/ar-15/

The bottom line is that the AR15 is no less dangerous than a regular hunting rifle, as it fires much weaker rounds.

In it's favor, it's a jack of all trades, and dominates a lot of applications from precision competition (Service Rifle, National Match Rifle), to home defense, to Action Sports, to patrol service, and even some hunting applications.

	<TEXT>  That part sounds super iffy, because how do you calculate the "burn" for either fat or carbs? I thought cells primarily "burned" glucose, not fat/carbs? Maybe I'm mis-remembering high school bio, but I thought that larger stuff like fat/carb/protein was broken down beforehand into glucose and other simple sugars to be "used"/"burned" by cells?

First off, I'm not an expert, don't have a background in this stuff, and have been trying to get a better handle on it purely as a layman who's interested in improving physical fitness. 

As I understand it, you're correct that the body uses glucose as a fuel for physical activity. However, your body only has a limited store of ready-to-go glucose on hand, and intense physical activity can rapidly deplete this supply.

Once your body's supply of glucose is depleted, in order to continue generating fuel for your exercise, the body has to switch over to breaking down fat and carbohydrates into glucose* that it can then utilize.

Evidently, one way to measure this is to determine what's called your VO2 max, basically the maximum volume of oxygen your body can utilize.

Here's an article that looks like it breaks down the process and machine used for testing that OP is talking about:

	<TEXT> I wonder how hard it would be to list a weekly running tally of the amount raised by each troll in their troll flair? 

It would be like a race to see which one is the best at raising money for gun rights! 

/u/whubbard is that something we could do?  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Take the /r/progun Charity Troll Challenge! </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-04-30 15:29:18 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Lately, it seems like the level of discourse around here has gotten worse, and this is due to an influx of graboid trolls who are only interested in disrupting the discussions, instead of actually trying to take part.

The mods here are big believers in the right to free expression, so the trolls don't get banned.

So I've decided to turn the aimless hate and vitriol of our trolls into a positive outlet for the 2nd Amendment.

Every time I come across a post from a graboid troll, I whip out my wallet and make a small donation ($5, or whatever the allowable minimum is) to a pro-gun organization that I pick at random.

Let me tell you, this feels AMAZING. Instead of being upset and crabby at some idiot troll (giving them exactly what they need) I now feel great because I'm helping out others. In fact, so far, our resident troll, tall_liberal2, has been responsible for me donating to the NRA-ILA, the Second Amendment Foundation, the Texas State Rifle Association, and the Independence Institute.

I didn't want to keep it to myself, so I figured I'd throw a post up and see if anyone else would be interested in taking part in a Charity Troll Challenge.

Here are the guidelines:

1.) Upon finding a post from a graboid troll, go to a website for a pro-gun group (bonus points for one that's in a state currently battling against Bloomberg's minions).

2.) Donate whatever amount you wish, via whatever means are available (credit card, paypal, bitcoin, time).

3.) If you can dedicate the donation to someone or leave a comment, say that it's for Reddit User (Troll's username.)

4.) Respond to the troll here by telling them which organization they've helped you donate to, and how much you've donated.

And that's it!

So, who else wants to help fight against trolls and for gun rights? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Dang. Look at that, another post from tall_liberal2!

So, I've just donated $5 to the Independence Institute in Colorado. They're currently suing the state over the universal background check law, and working with legislators to loosen the state's useless magazine ban.

Thanks for the reminder that I needed to donate to a pro-gun group! </TEXT>

Congratulations, you're now responsible for a $10 donation to the NRA-ILA.

	<TEXT> Interesting article. 

However, I think the issue if even more granular than the author claims. 

Even in states where new gun control laws have passed, (eg Colorado and Washington) it has only been in the face of massive popular opposition from those who don't live in large cities, and even a lot of law enforcement is refusing to enforce these laws.

	<TEXT> With high enough round counts, it's theoretically possible for the holes in a receiver that hold the pins for the trigger group to become worn and enlarged, as the pins will rotate and wear on the receiver. 

With enough wear from pin rotation, the holes can become so enlarged that the pins won't stay in place.

This is why KNS makes anti-rotation pins.

That said, I've never seen an AR with this problem. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> BATFE publishes an annual report listing every gun maker in the country, and how many guns they made. I don't remember if they break the list down by whether a given company makes pistols, rifles or shotguns though.

That said, you could probably get a decent idea of the number of semi-auto rifles made by running Google searches on company names.

It would be a lot of work, but that's probably your best bet for a reasonable ballpark figure. </TEXT>
