	<TEXT> I don't value human life all that highly, but I wouldn't do it. Even though I don't like overpopulation and think that to an extent tragedies, famines, and diseases are a good thing for decreasing the population, I still feel that 5.33 billion people have enough of a right to live that they shouldn't be killed intentionally. It's a weird idea to think about for me since I place freedom over lives and by killing them on purpose with no other reason than to kill them, I would be taking their freedom by taking their lives with no other reason.

Edit: But now I'm thinking about how this would effect supply and demand. Since most of the population will be gone, the homes, cars, and valuables that used that once belonged to them will end up being cheaper than before. There's potential looting to be done too. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I used to be and still sort of am one of those people you puzzle about. I really don't care about 30,000 deaths a year since that is still a small enough number that it couldn't put us at risk for extinction and I see it as sort of a good thing. I see it as sort of a good thing because that is 30,000 less people around to pollute, use resources, and reproduce to contribute to overpopulation. It also takes some strain off of Medicare and Social Security because most of those who die in the accidents die before 65. Basically, I see cars and motorcycles as "population control/natural selection machines", but that isn't a good enough reason to be against a new technology. I still do not really care about deaths from things like cars for these reasons and value freedom over lives and safety, but my view on autonomous cars is now neutral. If you want an autonomous car when they are available because you feel that is the better choice, so be it, but that doesn't mean I think we should ban manual cars from the roads. Maybe make licensing requirements and penalties for drunk or reckless driving stricter and make autonomous rental cars or cabs more readily available to those who don't have them but are in a situation where they shouldn't be driving though. </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2015-07-17 05:27:03 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I have always thought that this is one of those crazy ideas that may actually work, a sports team of cross-dressed males who play against actual female teams unbeknownst to them. I imagine that the male team would probably win an overwhelming amount of times due to their typically larger muscles, larger bodies, taller stature, higher aggression, and increased competitiveness due to testosterone. All this would probably mean they would pummel the real females. Also, how long could this kind of ruse last? I imagine that on an amateur level it would last far longer than on a professional level due to gender testing and media attention. However, even on an amateur level they might need to be careful which males they choose to play as females, as a team made up mostly of 6'3, 200lb "girls" with Adam's Apples would probably attract negative attention. I know that the Eastern Europeans used to do these shenanigans to some extent in the Olympics, but mostly not with team sports. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> From Wikipedia:
The GLK-Class is not sold in RHD markets, such as the United Kingdom and Australia, due to a driveshaft used to operate the front wheels on 4WD versions of the GLK. It is positioned such that it encroaches slightly on the right-hand-side footwell. In August 2014, however, it was announced the GLK-Class will be sold in the United Kingdom from Q4 2015.
 
It should be noted that Q4 2015 marks the end of production for the GLK, so this info hasn't been updated. </TEXT>
