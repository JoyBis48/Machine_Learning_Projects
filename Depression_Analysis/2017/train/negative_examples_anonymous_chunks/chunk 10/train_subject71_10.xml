	<TEXT> You do not base a restaurant upon a food trend because when that trend bursts there goes your restaurant. Happened to Cheeseology in the Loop unfortunately. That "Chef" apparently walked out of other kitchens as well from what I'm hearing. Thing is though that unless he was hired the day of the soft opening he should have already known that kitchen and menu before the soft opening. With that said it still sounds like these two guys have no clue on wtf they are doing. </TEXT>

Firefox can't find the server at cached.gq.

    Check the address for typing errors such as ww.example.com instead of www.example.com (Doesn't work.)
    If you are unable to load any pages, check your computer's network connection. (Works just fine.)
    If your computer or network is protected by a firewall or proxy, make sure that Firefox is permitted to access the Web. (It's not) </TEXT>
