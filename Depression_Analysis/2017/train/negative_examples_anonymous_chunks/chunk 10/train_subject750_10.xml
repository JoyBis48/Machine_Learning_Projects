	<TEXT> Haha. Hey, I figure if you're going to have a room full of 11-year old boys, you have to at least *try*. Surprising no one, the cake, bubblegum and cookies took a bigger hit than the veggie snacks. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It doesn't look much like marzipan (though I guess it's possible), but it could easily be modeling chocolate.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I really enjoyed the conversation about watching EVO and other e-sports gaming in this week's episode. A question for the uninitiated: Where does one watch something like EVO? And can it be viewed after-the-fact? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In general, you'll probably experience a happier internet if you insert the phrase "In my opinion..." at the beginning of every comment you read online. Speaking in absolutes is truly a conversation-killer, but it's not really intentional, 9.9 times out of 10. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We're pretty relaxed, but we do have some rules:

1. Drinks at the table are fine, but they need to be inside the cork inserts built into the table. To date, we've never had a spill (on the table), but wine glasses are the riskiest. Frankly, I'm generally more concerned about my table than I am about the games on top of it.

2. No food with your fingers. Period. We did not originally have this rule, but we play way too many games to adopt a laissez-faire attitude. Some are OOP or expensive, and it would frankly be more difficult to only have the rule *sometimes*. Also, replacing every $30-$40 game that gets grungy will add up over time. There are few things more disgusting than a playing card coated in a dull layer of pizza/chips/cookies/etc., built up over years of unprotected play.

3. I don't lend games if I care whether I ever see them again.
