It is insane to do the same thing over and over and expecting different results. When the rhetoric dusts settles down in the years to come, history will show Obama had the right approach and he will be remembered for it. That is unless we elect Scott Walker and he goes to war with Iran on day one of his presidency.

We have been doing this for decades and it had been a total failure. The time has come to put an end to this insanity. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Tahoe is very special in a lot of ways. 

* The water in Lake Tahoe could cover a flat area the size of California to a depth of 14 inches. This is enough to supply everyone in the United States with 50 gallons of water per day for 5 years. And believe it or not, the amount of water that evaporates from the surface of Lake Tahoe every year could supply a city the size of Los Angeles for 5 years.

* Tahoe has never frozen over. Waters are so cold in Lake Tahoe, staying a constant 39 degrees. The Lake Tahoe Basin has its share of below-freezing days and nights, but surprisingly enough the Lake itself has never frozen over. On occasion, Emerald Bay has been covered with a layer of ice, and ice also forms in cold protected inlets. However, Lake Tahoe's great depth and volume of water is always in motion and keeps it from being the world's largest ice rink.

This is the most right-wing twisting of a story I've seen today. What a joke. It will effect all government employees if the republican led congress does not pass a budget. Of course you are already trying to blame Obama for congress not doing their job.
