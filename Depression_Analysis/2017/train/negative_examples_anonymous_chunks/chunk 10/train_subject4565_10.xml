	<TEXT> You know how I got past this? I started reading the books. The show doesn't do as good a job setting the characters or stakes up as the books do. I never really felt connected to the characters when I watched it, but now I've nearly finished Book 2 and I kinda love it. Being inside the characters' heads makes it much easier to invest in and understand the gratuity. There's a lot of backstory the show pretty much ignores or makes confusing, but with the books, it's all laid out. </TEXT>

I'm sorry, but wtf was with that random sex scene? I can't believe Beast would be that naive. Why did we care that Cerebro was rekt, again?    
The original cut had something missing, but this one proved that what was missing was left out for a reason. I'm glad I saw it, but it's nothing special. Lightly disappointed. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> His first chapter and a half were dreadfully dull, but after the Asha reveal there's just this funny air about the everything else in it. Listening to him feeling insecure while everyone else has fun was hilarious. Asha is described as this cute badass chick, his uncles are cool and he's just completely intimidated. It really gets to him. I loved it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So you're saying that I have to get shafted to realise I was shafted?    
    
Kinda, yeah. There's a lot about this show that's worth watching. I definitely didn't call *you* pathetic, just the assumption you and many others have made - I worded that badly (and it made me sound like I was trying to insult you, which I wasn't. sorry). What I meant was that there's a lot of circlejerk over how Lost was or wasn't total disappointment, and then there's valid reasoning about whether it was or wasn't a disappointment. From your comment, you seem to assume that those who circlejerk over how *utterly offensive* the overall outcome and big picture of the show was, are correct. I never felt shafted, and plenty of people didn't. Season 1 was almost entirely character-centric, and expecting answers at the end of that kind of premiere season is, ya know, still valid, but nothing to be offended over. The show answers all of those questions in time, though with varying *relevance*. The relevance of those answers led some viewers to believe that certain answers weren't there, when they totally were - they were just pretty anticlimactic (in almost universally agreeable terms). This only speaks to several of the mysteries. And, like I said, they were not dead the whole time. Many people who even watched the show misinterpreted the ending. They all believe they were shafted and shout it from the rooftops. From hearing what aspects of the show you valued more, I can see you being disappointed in the ending, but you can never know. That's why I don't agree with you. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The reason I love LOST is because the awesome journey and extensive interesting and often heartbreaking character backstory and development made the ultimately pretty fucking silly destination feel worthwhile, because the characters got the ending they deserved. Yeah, it doesn't always feel "complete" and "all tied together" by the end if you look back to episodes like "Special" and "Dave" which try to make a big deal about things that ended up being irrelevant. There are plenty episodes that feel frustrating on rewatch because of this. However, I don't blame the show for that. Every series has its shortcomings (I love BrBa and GoT, but they certainly have their hits and misses). These are my favourite TV characters of all time. LOST accomplished so many spectacular things, and to completely overlook its achievements just to be salty about it missing small details, *especially if you only watched 24 episodes (/u/horsenbuggy)*, is a bit pathetic.    
I've heard fantastic arguments why the show is an ultimate disappointment, and I agree with many of their points, but...you can't assume one argument is right when you haven't seen the majority of what they're talking about. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not a fan of the on-island ending? I didn't mind it. I mean, the show gets silly very quickly. There's a massive turning point in season 4 where it goes from still semi-realistic to completely batshit insane, and they resolve that specific cliffhanger in season 5 with an answer which was even more batshit insane. It was around that point where they dropped flashbacks for good (except for the occasional episode) as a means for characterisation. That's where it dropped most of the viewers. I'd say if you missed any episodes before you watched the finale, you haven't given it a fair chance. As for the ending, it was just as silly as everything else had become on the show. That's kinda what I like about it - they committed to the lunacy they'd built up to. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Apparently when Carlton Cuse approached GRRM about why he didn't like the ending, GRRM said "I didn't like the fact that *they were dead the whole time*". GRRM didn't get the ending. I wonder if he would have liked it more if he understood it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> (Pilot does not mean premiere. A pilot is a proof-of-concept episode given to the network before a show is green-lit for series. Most shows use their pilots as their Season 1 premiere episode because of how expensive they were to shoot. Almost all of the footage from GoT's pilot episode was discarded, as was with the pilot for Sherlock.) </TEXT>
