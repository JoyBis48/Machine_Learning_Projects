Police are not required to explain themselves or their actions to you or any other person they detain or arrest. A failure to explain their actions to a citizen, either out of malice or ignorance, does not mean a lawful order can be ignored. They are only required to justify their actions in criminal and/or civil court. Do not mistake a lack of explanation for a lack of grounds. Only refuse to identify yourself if you are absolutely certain you stand on solid legal ground.
Do not attempt to stand up to police officers if you aren't equipped with enough knowledge to make a safe determination of what you're legally required to do and are prepared to endure a false arrest and charges. Any and all resistance must be passive. Never physically resist an officer (exceptions for extraordinarily extra-legal actions notwithstanding). If your rights are violated, seeking compensation will be hampered by any "bad" behavior on your part. Don't make your lawyer's job harder than it has to be. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This picture has been making the rounds the past few days.  No idea if this is real or a photoshoped, it was amusing enough to warrant sharing.  Our understanding is that the license plate on the truck is Belorussian.  The vehicle appears to be a [MT-LBu] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MT-LBu) of some sort.  Based on a quick search of the width of an MT-LBu and the height of the average semi-trailer, it seems plausible that the MT-LBu could fit inside a trailer as shown in the picture. </TEXT>
