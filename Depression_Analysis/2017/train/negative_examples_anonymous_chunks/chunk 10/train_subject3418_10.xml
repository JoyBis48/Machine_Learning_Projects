And now that gay marriage is "settled", they won't have to oppose it at every campaign stop during the primary and look wildly out of step with national public opinion during the general.

	<TEXT> I know the advertising (and my recruiter) say the reserves is "one weekend a month, two weeks a year", but how true is this? I've heard stories of longer/extra drill periods that come up. I'm more than happy to work extra when needed, but I live a few hours from the closest NOSC so I just wanted to get an idea. 

Also would officers be expected to work more hours/drills than enlisted?

Thanks! </TEXT>
