	<TITLE> HD Projector question </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-06-10 14:04:51 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I was thinking it would be fun to have back yard movie nights with my friends. I wanted to get an HD projector without going to crazy price wise (around $500). However when I started looking around I noticed projectors on places like ebay for 50-300 dollars that claim to be HD while other vendors charge 10 times as much. 

I was wondering what exactly the catch is. Why are they so cheap compared to proper projectors. Also any recommendations you guys have for projectors would be really appreciated.

Here is an example

[Example 1](http://www.ebay.com/itm/3000-Lumens-HD-1080P-Home-Cinema-Theater-Multimedia-LED-LCD-Projector-HDMI-3D-/161621153797?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0 hash=item25a15f1805)

[Example 2](http://www.ebay.com/itm/HD-Home-Theater-Multimedia-LCD-LED-Projector-1080-HDMI-3D-AV-DVD-TV-Paystation-/281633294609?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0 hash=item4192a70911)

	<TEXT> This post must be fairly new because I can see your awesome reply instead of 10 people bitching about their "asshole" parents and how they overcame it to become a top poster on /r/raisedbynarcissists. 

I miss my dad too. It never gets easier.  </TEXT>
