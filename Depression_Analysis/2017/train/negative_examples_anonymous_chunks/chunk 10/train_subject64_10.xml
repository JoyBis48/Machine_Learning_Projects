	<TEXT> From the story:  "Mrs. Clinton has made support for gay people one of the cornerstones of her presidential campaign."  This was a political act to attempt to secure the votes of the gay community.  If it had been "nonpolitical" then we would never have heard about Mrs. Clinton's post because she would have sent a private message instead.  And her campaign certainly wouldn't have publicized the missive by sharing it with the world on Twitter.

I noticed that you've only been on reddit for a couple of years and a moderator for far less time.  I think you should run some of the posts you propose to delete by a more experienced mod before you act.  It makes me think that you have a particular political bent and are simply deleting stories that don't fit within your bias. </TEXT>
