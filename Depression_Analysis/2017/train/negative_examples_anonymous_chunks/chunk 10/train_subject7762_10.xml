	<TEXT> I had an ex do me one better. We had a birthday, anniversary, Christmas happening 3 consecutive months. 

I bought her a flatscreen tv, 2 purses (LV   Coach), a bed room set, took her on a snowboarding trip to mammoth, bought her full snowboard, boots, bindings, clothing for the trip. 

She waits until after NYE to break up with me because we had plans to go to Vegas.

I spoke with a close friend after, who told me my ex was cheating on me for about a year, but my friend didn't want to say anything to me because she thought I looked happy, and she didn't want to be the one to break up a happy relationship.

Yay me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have a few British friends and at first I would talk politely with them and, to me, it would sound like they were being polite with me.

But they would laugh to themselves at certain things they would say. Or after I said certain things.

After a while I came to realize that they were making fun of me and I had not even realized it. The sarcastic fucks! 

Some of the slang they used were unfamiliar to me, so that could have made things more difficult for me to understand.

Needless to say, we get along better, but I know them for the sarcastic, wankers they really are. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I came here to suggest this. /u/Nukemi

By far the easiest option that would provide you with hundreds of thousands of songs. And it's relatively inexpensive. 

You can take any and all song requests all night.

Things you need:

- Djay app 

- Spotify premium

- Apple computer or laptop

- Reliable internet connection

- Compatible hardware controller

If you already have cdj 2000nxs and a mixer, you're good to go. If not you can buy an inexpensive controller, like the Pioneer DDJ-WeGO3 which is about $300. (You can always return it after the gig)

Good luck and have fun! Remember, the night isn't about you or your ability to dj, it is about the bride   groom, and what their guests want to hear. </TEXT>
