	<TEXT> Snarky? Matt isn't snarky. Well, maybe in the Waid run.

I love Daredevil because he's had some of the best character work in modern comics. Over a decade he slowly had a massive mental breakdown due to the death of a loved one and the outing of his secret identity. The Bendis/Brubaker era was like one really well written TV series with a main character arc comparable to Breaking Bad. All he wants is to protect the citizens of his city, but it all comes at a massive cost to his mental well-being. Frank Miller and Kevin Smith also touched upon this and I think that's part of what makes their books so great.

Looking elsewhere, there are a lot of fun stories. I've heard the Waid interpretation as a swashbuckler. </TEXT>

Edit: Seriously guys? You're downvoting me because I like a costume. I'm not asking for black Spider-Man or trying to say I'd prefer to see Miles. I'm just saying I'd like to see [this extremely badass costume](http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/portland-press-herald_3535489-674x1024.jpg) in a film. It's a great costume and it'd certainly help differentiate from other live-action incarnations. I thought this sub was better than downvote to disagree. </TEXT>

Red Skull wasn't great and the action is hardly memorable, but overall, it's very enjoyable. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Community - Tell Dan Harmon to make the show about the characters rather than himself. I enjoyed the first couple seasons a lot, but near the end the character's personalities were flip-flopping all over the place and Harmon was explicitly writing episodes to make fun of things he didn't like (even if most of his viewers do). I miss the days Abed was cute, now he's just an excuse for Harmon to say something meta. Honestly, I don't think it's even funny anymore. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Frankly, I couldn't stand this show at first, but complicated plotting, great character work and funny dialogue really made the show grow on me so I personally think Marvel's Agents of Shield is much more deserving than a 7.5. I don't think anything about an 8.3, but still, the show improved vastly, but I feel it took way too long to do it. The direction is still kinda bland and as a result, so is the action, but it's still a pretty entertaining show. </TEXT>

I've got volume 4 of Preacher lying next to my bed and I'm waiting for the last two volumes in the post. These books are both more deserving or movies than characters like Cyborg or Ant-Man (saying that as a DC and Marvel fanboy) yet they've spent so long in development hell. Thank God Preacher is getting a show and the fact it's replacing Mad Men's slot in the AMC line-up gives me high expectations. </TEXT>

Watching him torture people and use excessive violence to get revenge and deliver his own form of justice reminds me much more of Charles Bronson in Death Proof than Robin Hood (which is where most of his basic characterisation comes from). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Completely fresh start with a focus on telling great stories. We see everyone starting out again at the cost of some great supporting characters. Certain books will have interlinked storylines, but no company wide crossovers. Books will be aware of each other, but won't need to conform to match the main books or whatever. We slowly build to the Justice League for like a year or two in each characters respective books, then the first crossover is the formation of the Justice League. A similarly variety of books to DC's current line up. Only two books per character maximum. Origins are rebooted. Creative control is left in the hands of writers and artists and they propel storylines. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Please don't. They're both abysmal and contribute little to the characters outside of the book itself.

The only books starring Batman that are good are Batman and Robin, Batman and Detective Comics from #30 onwards. The rest are crap. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Honestly, the first four suck really bad. They're horrendous, but most gearheads I know love them for the exact reason you listed. Come the fifth one, they pretty much became heist/superhero movies. There's only about fifteen minutes of racing between the last three films. And they actually got some pretty interesting female characters which is more than I can say for most blockbusters. They're a bit like a racially and sexually diverse Mission Impossible, they just do ridiculous stunts and banter with each other and that's what makes it so entertaining. Watching the Rock and Vin Diesel have one-liner offs or Ludachris and Tyreese Gibson arguing is just so damn funny and the cast has great chemistry. The setpiece at the end of five is such a blast to watch I feel I have to mention that. If you must watch one, watch Fast 5. It introduces the Rock, has some of he best action (well, maybe 7 can rival it) and it has a pretty great villain. </TEXT>
