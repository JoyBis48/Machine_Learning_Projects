	<TEXT> Yeah and I agree, these videos are awesome! It does seem simple so it's cool to see how producers tweak their samples to get the sound they want. Those samples were pitched up 6/10 of a semitone. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've heard it's a bad sign when a dog starts doing that "I'll bite you but I'm not really biting you" thing. It's them testing to see if they can put part of Little Billy in their mouths and get away with it.

Convoluted but - I knew a guy who's Nan had a friend that had a big dog and it started doing this to the new baby. Not really a bite, just putting its mouth around the baby's hands and feet. They walked in the room once and the dog had the baby's arm in its mouth, somehow they thought nothing of it. Next day, the dog mauled the poor bab's face off.   

Edit: punctuation </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 91 minutes and 37 seconds is in the 92nd minute of the game. The first minute of the game is from 0-1minute.

Kind of how the years 1900-1999 are the 20th century. I hope that makes any sense.

	<TEXT> A guy I know makes a similar product and is set to hit $20 million this year. He created a marketable brand, then he hired a hot girl to follow other hot girls on Instagram and offer free samples. Rinse and repeat. 

It's a numbers game and I'm making it sound easy but social media is a really useful tool for marketing beauty products, especially if the customer uses the body scrub as part of their daily routine. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah they get taken down and re-uploaded. 

Ahh, I thought I recognised the name. It's interesting what you say about them helping to drag you out of a sad mood, they do the same for me, I guess it's a comfort thing.

I'll check out the animated stuff, watched some of it when it first came out. Have you listened to the bonus hour podcast they did, it's my go to! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALGFVxKv2f4

	<TEXT> I know it's a joke, but it seems that a large portion of users here resort to penis/ejaculation references to describe their appreciation of something. 

Look at a thread of a good goal or bit of skill, and at least one of the top comments will be "I came" or "My erection just exploded hrnggggg".

That's my observation, I'm not saying this is good or bad. 

Edit: maybe 'large portion' is a bit much, but these penis comments do get upvoted </TEXT>
