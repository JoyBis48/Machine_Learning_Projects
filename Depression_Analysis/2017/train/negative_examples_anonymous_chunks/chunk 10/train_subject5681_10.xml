	<TEXT> Words right from Sandra Bullock in 2013- 

"Well, think of a bidet, right? said Bullock. Theres several processes. You have number one, you have number two, and then the cleanup.

But it doesnt stop there. Turns out the seashells are also musical instruments. You can use them as little maracas as well, continued Bullock, giving an example of the sort of beat you can drop with the futures answer to toilet paper. See, its a musical instrument, and its a hygiene element! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you watch the very first movie, it kinda explains that every fighter in Mortal Kombat has a superhuman ability, that gets intensified multiple times over when they enter Outworld and the Tournament. So in this theory I would assume it would increase their ability to take more devastating hits and as you said, until they lose the will to continue fighting.
