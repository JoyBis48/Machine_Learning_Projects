	<TEXT> In the end, some idiots will buy it. Reminds me of the USB-C Apple made, a guy built a universal adapter for it and made [$800K+ on Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/nonda/get-your-macbook-ports-back) off their stupidity.

	<TEXT> Makes sense, we had accepted pre-orders after our campaign cause we had extra stock in the manufacturing run anyways, but yea you're right, nothing harmful comes if you collect e-mails and send out when you are ready. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Great analysis Dan, I agree of course on putting your backers first, but you can actually accept pre-orders in a good by charging the customer instantly through [Grandst](https://grandst.com/).
When we ran our [1Sheeld Kickstarter campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/integreight/1sheeld-replace-your-arduino-shields-with-your-sma), we accepted pre-orders afterwards, shipped to our Kickstarter backers first, then pre-orders, then got it on Amazon and in retail.
It's an interesting approach though as we are launching another product soon and it makes sense to fulfill your Kickstarter orders first then worry about other orders, I'll consider it in plan :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yea I read that, my first thought is to encourage backers who have doubts to pledge and not wait for retail.
Still you can accept pre-orders and announce a late shipping date, right?   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm trying to buy a couple of Tiko3D printers for the office, it's a $179 3D printer and hit well on [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/tiko3d/tiko-the-unibody-3d-printer), and I was surprised to find they are not accepting pre-orders on their [website](http://www.tiko3d.com/), any thoughts on why are they NOT making money? </TEXT>
