EDIT: now it's working again... kinda. Hola users can keep refreshing and it will work. Not sure about others. But clearly Netflix have stepped up their security. If you have a working VPN service that can access the US library, please share. I don't want to go outside. Tis a silly place. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Racism is the one thing in the world that makes me actually rage. This is not racism. I live on an island with a majority black population. While black people love the water just as much as us whiteys do, if not more, they really are terrible swimmers. I've seen black kids jump 40 feet off cliffs, do a perfect backflip jackknife, then pop up and doggy paddle their ass back to the dock asap. That said, it's not a rule, rather a trend. The armchair Freakonomics writer in me wants to say it might just come down to whose parents pay for swim classes, or where you grow up. I'm a super strong swimmer because I grew up on a beach with a vicious rip-tide and a father who'd chuck me into it then tell me to swim back to him, not because I'm white. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, I've TRIED to explain this in one of my articles, but really, I have no idea. Short story is that it's a combination of factors. The wing-sail exploits the Bernoulli principle, the same thing that makes planes fly. The foils then practically eliminate drag by pushing the boats out of the water. These two combinations mean the boats can get going way faster than anyone, even the designers of the boats themselves, predicted. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not only that, they are capable of reaching three times the wind speed in much shallower waters, allowing stadium seating for spectators. Historically only those with access to private boats were able to watch the races. The wing sail the boats are using is also a huge improvement as it allows them to not be at the mercy of the wind as much as they were in the past. This meant there were huge delays in the action, which is terrible for TV.

For the next finals though they've shrunk the size down to 48 feet. The AC48 while smaller is a lot more affordable to build (SF only had three boats competing because of the price).

	<TEXT> Strange memories on this nervous night in Las Vegas. Five years later? Six? It seems like a lifetime, or at least a Main Erathe kind of peak that never comes again. San Francisco in the middle sixties was a very special time and place to be a part of. Maybe it meant something. Maybe not, in the long run . . . but no explanation, no mix of words or music or memories can touch that sense of knowing that you were there and alive in that corner of time and the world. Whatever it meant. . . .

History is hard to know, because of all the hired bullshit, but even without being sure of history it seems entirely reasonable to think that every now and then the energy of a whole generation comes to a head in a long fine flash, for reasons that nobody really understands at the timeand which never explain, in retrospect, what actually happened.

My central memory of that time seems to hang on one or five or maybe forty nightsor very early morningswhen I left the Fillmore half-crazy and, instead of going home, aimed the big 650 Lightning across the Bay Bridge at a hundred miles an hour wearing L. L. Bean shorts and a Butte sheepherder's jacket . . . booming through the Treasure Island tunnel at the lights of Oakland and Berkeley and Richmond, not quite sure which turn-off to take when I got to the other end (always stalling at the toll-gate, too twisted to find neutral while I fumbled for change) . . . but being absolutely certain that no matter which way I went I would come to a place where people were just as high and wild as I was: No doubt at all about that. . . .

There was madness in any direction, at any hour. If not across the Bay, then up the Golden Gate or down 101 to Los Altos or La Honda. . . . You could strike sparks anywhere. There was a fantastic universal sense that whatever we were doing was right, that we were winning. . . .

And that, I think, was the handlethat sense of inevitable victory over the forces of Old and Evil. Not in any mean or military sense; we didnt need that. Our energy would simply prevail. There was no point in fightingon our side or theirs. We had all the momentum; we were riding the crest of a high and beautiful wave. . . .

So now, less than five years later, you can go up on a steep hill in Las Vegas and look West, and with the right kind of eyes you can almost see the high-water markthat place where the wave finally broke and rolled back.

EDIT: I went through an HST phase like everyone else, but I went a bit further. I devoured everything he wrote. Even copied his short stories out by hand. Without a doubt Fear and Loathing is his best work, but I'd really recommend people pick up The Great Shark Hunt, which is a collection of his short stories. That said, out of his entire bibliography, this quote still sticks with me the most. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In my 27 years I've learned dealing with assholes is a part of life. There's a family that's moved onto a sailboat just off my dock (I live on an island) and I initially said they could use it to move their shit back and forth as they made it into a place they were able to live in.

They've since torn the ass out of my favour, use it all the time, and disrupt the guests I have living in the vacation cottage I rent out when they're down on my dock relaxing/kayaking/gawking at the turtles. I posted private property signs, put a chain across the path leading to my dock, but they kept using it. Instead of going out to their boat and smashing it, I called the respective authorities, reported them for illegal mooring and trespassing without filing charges. The police spoke to them and they haven't used it since. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Then you get the list of registered license plates from the property manager, call the authorities, show them the unregistered license plate parked illegally, and have it towed. Not sure if property managers do that everywhere, but they do where I'm from.

Or you come up with a creative, infruriatingly annoying (but legal) solution yourself. Box them in. Cover the car in bird food. Have a stakeout and wait for the repeat offender to show up and don't let him park there. Cover their car in sticky notes. The reason they are parking there in the first place is because it's clearly more convenient. Make it inconvenient. 

My problem is that the punishment doesn't match the crime. This is an inconvenience. Smashing someone's window as a response is outright destructive, not to mention foolish because in the end it will most likely cause you way more grief than it's worth. I'd rather not risk the ball-ache that would come with being charged with destruction of property. I was a court reporter for three years and I can assure you that risking a legal battle over something like this is just not. worth. your. time.  </TEXT>

I'm bored and curious, so trying to figure out how much energy the racers in the Tour produce over the course of the event and how that compares to the energy consumption of a town or city. Ie: riders produce an average combined total of X watts over the course of the TdF, enough to power x for x amount of time. </TEXT>

The other one I got while sailing. I was in a two man boat with a weighted keel and we hit a rock, sending my crew overboard. As I tried to wheel the boat around to get him, I hit another rock and my leg slipped out from under me and wailed the traveller bar.

Excruciating. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I drive a motorcycle and I get caught in the rain from time to time, so I've always wondered this.

Driving fast means I arrive at my destination faster, reducing my overall exposure, but surely the faster I move forward the more rain I come in contact with. But driving slowly has the exact same problem. I reduce my overall contact with the raindrops, but increase my exposure time.

For the purpose of the question, I've made things simpler, and perhaps more applicable to the everyday person. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not seen What If, but Horns and Notebook were exactly what I was thinking. There are a lot of actors that would've killed those roles. Radcliffe merely fills them. He's a well trained actor, don't get me wrong, but he's only where he is today because he looked the part for Harry Potter when he was a boy. A Young Doctor's Notebook is extremely well written, and I think deserved more than Radcliffe alongside Hamm.

I'd just like to add downvoting someone because they don't like an actor you do is why this site is going down the drain soon. I think I'm contributing to the discussion by adding an alternative viewpoint, one that's been informed by experience in film and screenwriting.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> At least it wasn't comic sans.

Serious tip though. Pao was pre-packaged for redditors to dislike considering her history. The fact she has an easily punnable name didn't help either. Also, she isn't a founder of the site. The decisions made while she was in charge gave the distinct appearance that this was a CEO who didn't know what they were doing and was enforcing their own agenda on the company.

At the end of the day I'm blown away nobody stepped up to the plate to let Reddit know what was really going on, that Pao was not to blame. This could have been avoided entirely if someone had the stones to say: "This is what we all think should happen going forward, and that's been the case since before Ms Pao was hired." </TEXT>
