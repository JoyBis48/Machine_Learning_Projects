	<TITLE> Local ISP refuses to provide High Speed Internet. </TITLE>

	<TEXT> So a friend of mine built his house just on the edge of town and for over a year now local ISP (Eastlink and Bell) refuse to hook him up with high speed internet.
The issue arises from the fact that currently the house across the street (less than 100 ft away) has access to high speed. However, the ISP says they would have to run additional cables to allow my friend to be connected. The kicker...they want him to pay for their infrastructure.
I've got a home being build next door to my friend, even closer to the house with high speed access and doubt I'll be able to have access to it.
We've both been told, "You will be able to have access to our Rural connection, good luck."
Now, considering their current high speed connnectiong is 50 down/ 5 up and their rural is 1.5 down / 0.5 up.... there is literally no way in hell I can handel that bad of a bandwidth. And to top it all off the ISP is going to put a 15 GB data cap on their Rural connectiom starting in the fall.

Tl;dr - Fuck ISP's in rural Nova Scotia, they don't give a shit about their customers or the service they provide, and only care about their bottom line.
It ain't  only comcast that screws people! </TEXT>
