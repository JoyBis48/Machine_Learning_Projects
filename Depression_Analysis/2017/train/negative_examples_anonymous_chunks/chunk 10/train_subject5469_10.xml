	<TEXT> [USA Today Reported](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2015/07/20/collapsed--10-bridge-given-rating-just-last-year/30428515/) that the I-10 bridge that collapsed in Riverside County was given an 'A' rating a year ago. This is false.

There are two, 2 lane Bridges; eastbound and westbound. The newer westbound bridge was given an 'A' rating. *The bridge that collapsed, the eastbound bridge, was given a "Functionally Obsolete" rating by the National Bridge Inventory.* Functionally Obsolete ratings are given to bridges that are in such disrepair or old enough that the only thing to do is destroy them and start over. 

Why the USA Today headline stated that it had an 'A' rating was either extremely bad journalism or an attempt to calm drivers/avoid lawsuits. 

Story that notes the Functionally Obsolete rating of the eastbound bridge:

While officials had deemed the Tex Wash bridge on eastbound I-10 "functionally obsolete," its westbound bridge  also built in 1967  was listed as "not deficient."

	<TEXT> I'll use the example of my Apache friend. 

His family (especially grandma) are Traditional. They don't want electricity, they want to live in traditional housing, keep livestock, grow and cook traditional foods and make clothing- maintain their culture. The kids are taught the Apache language (my friend knows Apache and Navajo). 

BIA came on the rez and built these little modular homes and literally tried to force the traditionals to live in them and give up their gardens and livestock. The great grandmother had spent time in a BIA School where they were beaten for speaking their native language. To the family, this was the same sort of thing. 

To kill a peoples traditions and culture and homogenize them is cultural genocide. It has been done many times in the past; often by use of violence- especially in the name of Christianity. Right now Europe is trying to do this to the Roma Gypsy culture. 

btw- the BIA was not legally successful in making the traditional people give up their lifestyle.

And the segregation part? I am sure you have seen the 'whites only' drinking fountain pictures.

The important thing is to allow equality for all mankind while supporting and appreciating different cultural traditions. </TEXT>

My high school boy friend and his buddies had 

1968 GTO with flames up the nose - that they dropped a 455 in.

1965 Mustang - original Forest Green. They put a different motor in it too but I can't recall offhand what it was.

1964 gray Fury with a push button tranny that was a sleeper- they put hydraulic lifts under it and capped the headers - running a push button to the inside. So if some muscle car rolled up beside this 'grandma' car he could jack it and uncap the headers at the same time. 

It did an 8.5 quarter mile out at the airport (where they used to race).  We called it the Gray Goose.  </TEXT>

These people aren't expressing 'free speech', they are posting corporate sponsored messaging. 

Point 2: Building a sub is like building a house. Admin preventing mods from unwanted and unwarranted intrusion is like the police telling everyone they have to let people come in their houses at will and they can't do anything about it.

If they want to kill reddit- this is a sure way to do it.  </TEXT>

But if I could not remove bad posts or remarks from my own sub I would shut down immediately. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The *real* issue with gypsies is that they refuse to register via birth certificates, drivers licenses or any of the personal 'tagging' that states and countries do to individuals. They don't support massive economies and they aren't of the consumer class. 

They are one of the last 'free people' left on earth and a lot of negative PR is generated against them. Unfortunately, average people buy into it, rumors spread, etc. Kind of like how the Nazis successfully excoriated the Jews. I am not saying the gypsies are perfect, but it's interesting how all people speak about FREEDOM!! But when there is a population of people actually *living* it, they freak out. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you read the sticky you will see that we have posted storm warnings that have actually assisted people in taking cover or warning relatives. We try to stay on top of events such as PDS (Particularly Dangerous Situation) NWS Warnings for tornado outbreaks and post these ahead of time. [Here is a sample of one that was also xposted to the regional areas it was affecting](https://www.reddit.com/r/StormComing/comments/23rgt5/significant_multiday_severe_event_expected_across/?). Otherwise we archive the after storm story. 

I just happened to be following Dan Gottshalks twitter feed last night on his chase and caught that when it was posted, so popped the link in here.

Tornados are not exceptional in Ill, but it is late in the season and it kind of caught the NWS by surprise with only a 2% chance that day of tornados in the area.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> **For new members and a reminder to our veterans:**

/r/StormComing is simply this: an Archive of Earth Changing Disasters and Events, manmade or natural.
It's not a place for HAARPtards, Climate Change Deniers, Flat-Earthers, or Eschatology/Rapturists to post theorems. And as we want to attract sane, logical redditors, we don't want to hear about how radiation is good for everyone.  #3232;_ #3232;

This sub is best read using 'new' rather than 'hot' or 'top' as it is an archive of events.
If you want to add an Earth-changing or disaster story from the news or reliable source, please do. Since headline writers often fail, feel free to editorialize titles to fill in important details from the story- especially the location.

We have already heard from someone who saw a flash flood forecast here that saved them from swimming home from work. Other redditors have been alerted to Tornado Outbreaks and took safety precautions. So we feel we are fulfilling the purpose of the sub.

As /r/StormComing is an archive of events, there is nothing subjective about it. Downvoting anything here would be as stupid as downvoting an encyclopedia entry.

Feel free to x-post to other reddits, especially reddits that are geographically related to the area the event or warning concerns. Please insert the np when doing so. As in www.*np*.reddit.com/r/StormComing.blah.blah in the referral link back to /r/StormComing.

**About Flair:**

Huge thanks to kooldawgstar for developing our flair system.

*Extreme Weather*: (including watches/warnings), torrential rains, record breaking wind events, temperatures, tornados, hurricanes, etc.

*Geology*: Landslides, earthquakes, sinkholes, Floods and flood watches/warnings, wildfires, droughts and impacts of droughts

*Disease*: Disease outbreaks of all kinds, including rabies threats.

*Space*: Solar Storms that may have impact on Earth and anything related to space, and near earth objects like meteors

*Animal*: Anything related to animals, ex. animal attacks, mass animal deaths, etc.

	<TEXT> I have heard that comparison, and this is why it is bullshit: 

Video games *do not* actively encourage real-life, hostile behavior toward a minority segment of society by real human beings sitting in positions of acting authority. 

If you have ever been to a white supremacist website you will see constant, active discussions about how certain races need to be eradicated because they are 'dangerous' to the rest of polite society. 

To a young, impressionable or susceptible person lurking on these sites it could seem as if the majority of people, including people in leadership, feel this way and that by taking the sort of action the shooter took that he would be hailed as a hero.

This is not comparable to 'violent video games' in the slightest. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Roof said explicitly in his manifesto that he was not raised racist and he 'woke up' after discovering a white supremacist website online.

So basically he would not have found the sanction and encouragement to be as racist as he became - racist enough to go on a shooting spree.

What the hell can I say? It's a fucking shame, but it's a fact.

The real question is whether or not Reddit is willing to host the sort of 'free speech' that can lead to an event such as this. What would happen to Reddit if the kid had mentioned /r/coontown for having been an influence? Can you even imagine?

There is no debate in Germany, Italy or France. They have had experience with this that lead to a World War and the genocide of millions. Hate sites are banned in those countries. I can't judge them for that, knowing their history.

Quote from an article about a little boy studying by the light from a Mcdonalds in the street:

---------------------------------

 *Despite strong economic growth in recent years,* roughly one quarter of the Philippines' 100 million people still live on less than one dollar a day, and giant slums dominate all major cities.

Just a reminder that most of the time 'strong economic growth' means that some bastards are getting ultra rich at the expense of the majority.

	<TEXT> These were from the 1960's. The 1950's until the Russians invaded and then the Beardy Men took over were a renaissance for Afghanistan.

During the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan, the government of the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan (PDPA) reformed the education system; education was stressed for both sexes, and widespread literacy programmes were set up. By 1978, women made up 40 percent of the doctors and 60 percent of the teachers at Kabul University; 440,000 female students were enrolled in educational institutions and 80,000 more in literacy programs.

	<TEXT> Aquarist for 45 years. Was in the fish industry - wholesale and retail for nearly 20 of them. I have always let spot algae (if it grew) grow on my back glass and sometimes end sides of my tanks (if the tank were in a wall). I also let it grow on my driftwood and rocks to a degree if it showed up. I have never had an issue with this and it provides Ottos   Amanos a regular diet. I have also not had an issue of it 'transferring' to healthy plants. I think it provides a more natural microbiota in the tank and lends a more natural look until it runs it's course.

But that's just my experience. </TEXT>

Edit: in case you are interested- here is a [paper](http://plantcellbiology.masters.grkraj.org/html/Plant_Cellular_Physiology4-Absorption_Of_Mineral_Nutrients.htm) on effect of ph on plant nutrient uptake:

The degree of ionization of minerals and other nutrients depends upon the hydrogen ion concentration of the soil solution.  For example, most of the phosphate ions, at alkaline pH exist either as bivalent H3PO4 ions or trivalent H3PO4 ions.  Such ions are not favored for absorption.  On the other hand neutral pH favors the absorption of monovalent ions.  So the soil pH has a significant effect not only on the rate but also the kind of ions uptake.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A Prayer for Owen Meany- John Irving

The last paragraph utterly crushed me and the last line was like a spike through my flattened remains. I would spontaneously burst into tears for days after finishing the novel.

	<TEXT> No, they don't destroy brick and concrete structures as easily as wood and plasterboard. The EF rating system for Tornados is developed around the type of home or building that is destroyed and the level of destruction. Tornados that destroy brick or block structures are of a higher rating on the 1 to 5 scale than those that destroy frame homes. 

I lived through the '74 SuperOutbreak, have been a chaser and I have been through a few Hurricanes. You can always tell the wood built homes after an EF5 because those are the ones with scrubbed foundations. 

The long term after-effects of dealing with the standard wood frame, drywall and fiber insulation is also much worse than a block or brick home. When it is ground up into dust size particles it causes ['Tornado Cough' as a very long term after effect.](http://kfor.com/2013/06/19/tornado-cough-threatening-families-in-devastated-areas/) 

I lived through the eye of Opal in my Florida 'hurricane' house built in the 1950's of cement block with terrazzo floor and a cement and gravel roof.  A new neighborhood 2 blocks away from my house was built with wood and shingle homes. The destruction there was incredible. There was basically no destruction in our neighborhood besides someone who lost a garage door and a few overhang awnings that ended up in a golf course.  </TEXT>
