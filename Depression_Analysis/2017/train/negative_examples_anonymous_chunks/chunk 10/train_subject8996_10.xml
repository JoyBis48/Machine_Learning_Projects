	<TEXT> Reebok is complicit. They in fact did decide how much money the fighters would get. They came up with the ugly designs. They are the ones profiting from the fighters and not compensating them. They are the ones who have shown no effort in their product or the concerns of the fighters. They are just as guilty as the UFC. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Frank Mir is light years better than Stann or Florian. Florian's high pitched voice is annoying. Stann doesn't understand fighting and regurgitates random facts and his broscience (like lactic acid build up in the muscles which is pure fiction). 

If the UFC spends money on focus groups to determine who is the best, I have no doubt Frank Mir will beat out everyone on the B team.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Arizona is very diverse in terms of politics. A large majority of people are not racist. The state is independent heavy. In Maricipa County (location of metropolitan phoenix), the most populated county, the Republicans do win out. Down south in Tucson they're far more democrat. I know Arizona seems like a solid red state but that might not always be the case. With changing demographics we will certainly eventually go purple and very well could turn blue in a decade or two.  </TEXT>
