	<TEXT> So, we know it took at least PART of Rose to make Steven, and Lion has so many links with Rose... isn't it safe to say that the parts of Rose that weren't needed to make Steven, made Lion. I mean... HE'S FUCKING PINK! He had Rose's sword in him, and her battle flag. Rose told Pearl all her secrets, so if Lion was around before Rose died, Pearl would have known. There are also some BIG holes in this theory, like, wasn't someone there when Steven was born? Wouldn't they see Lion being born, and why would Lion be in the desert and not with the gems like Steven was his whole life? If I think of some more I will post in comments. </TEXT>
