(The pen-pin merger just means that when I say a word that has a "short e" before a nasal - that is, n or m - I turn it into a "short i", so that the word pen and the word pin sound exactly alike to me. This isn't universal in American English, and is more common Down South and among African-Americans, iirc.) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I suppose it depends on what sort of food you like to cook. 

If you mostly like Italian style cooking, I'd go with fennel, oregano, "italian seasoning", garlic powder (if for some reason you don't want to do fresh garlic) or rosemary, paprika.

If you mostly like "American, non-regional" style cooking, I'd go with nutmeg, cinnamon, paprika, cumin (or thyme, I forgot thyme is a thing), and bay leaves (or oregano).

If you mostly like Indian style cooking, then I'd go with coriander, cardamon, cinnamon, nutmeg, and cumin.

If you mostly like Tex-mex, then I'd go with cumin, paprika, smoked paprika (because smoked paprika is delicious), oregano, and something else.

You see the problem here? My top five varies depending on what sort of foods I plan to cook. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> True. Often, different populations will define the same word differently. However, that doesn't mean that either population is *wrong*. It just means that they are different, and perhaps that there will be some confusion between those two populations.

When you know what another person means, and they are using a widely accepted definition of a word, it is thus incorrect to tell them they are wrong.

Merriam-Webster, for the record, lists both definitions:

http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/factoid

The "untrue fact" definition comes first, however, that doesn't mean that it is used by more people. Merriam-Webster traditionally puts the older definitions first, whether or not they are the most common. I believe they are in the process of changing this, but they haven't gotten to every entry yet. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> How are you wrong? Let me count the ways.

1. Christians didn't "adapt" anything... and there are a heck of a lot of Christians who *do* take the Bible very literally. (Except when they don't. I know people who believe that the miracle at Cana was turning water into grape juice.)

2. Muslim society in the 11th century was far in advance of Christian society.

3. Muslims today are not generally "stuck in the 11th century".

4. Like Christians, Muslims hold a wide range of opinions and views. Just like we don't assume all Christians are like Fred Phelps, we shouldn't assume all Muslims are like bin Ladin.

5. Syrians do not universally hate the West, and it is doubtful they hate Uruguay specifically.

6. It is worth mentioning, again, that a good number of Syrian refugees *are not Muslim*.

7. It is not impossible to learn a new language.

8. You know darn well that if YOU were in THEIR shoes, you'd run to any country willing to take you and be grateful. Well, maybe you wouldn't be grateful, but I'm pretty sure they will be. Helping the poor is what we're supposed to do as a civilized society.

This list is incomplete. I ran out of energy, but you didn't run out of errors. Your comment is, indeed, fractally wrong. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Putting aside the fact that a good number of Syrian refugees *aren't Muslim* (seriously, how you've missed hearing about the Yazidis and the Druze, I don't know), not all Muslims take the Quran equally literally. You might as well say that Uruguay should expel its Christians because "Wine is a mocker, strong drink is raging: and whosoever is deceived thereby is not wise" is in the Bible. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Anti-abortion groups have been targeting Roe v Wade protections ever since, trying to find the argument that can bring it down.

Nothing is ever "settled". Look at Plessy v Ferguson. That was "settled" law for decades, but dedicated work brought it down smashingly in the middle of the last century.

(Now, I'm against Plessy but for Roe. I don't want you to think, by my citing both, that I look favorably on the work of those who campaign against abortion, nor that I think the civil rights movement was bad. I simply couldn't think of another example.) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, Salt Lake City spends about half the cost (IIRC. It's a heck of a lot less, anyway) on housing them than they were doing on ER visits and whatnot beforehand. Do you need me to cite that?

New edit: Of course I'll cite it.

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/01/08/daily-show-homelessness_n_6437644.html

Now, Salt Lake City has a population just under 200,000. And they have just about 2,000 homeless people (which counts those who are now housed by this initiative, as near as I can tell). Which means that about 1% of the population is homeless. Somebody ran the numbers upthread, and in NYC we have slightly less homelessness per capita, at .7% of the population. </TEXT>

With little alternative, of course they do. You might as well say that the victims of the Triangle Shirtwaist Fire *chose* to work under *those* conditions, for *that* pay.

Forcing our views upon the people of Myanmar risks the livelihood of all of the lower paid workers there.

	<TEXT> First, up until CoS, they always had at least one child home. And as she was homeschooled, they were doing it on one income - I don't think Molly would accept it if Bill and Charlie sent money home, do you?

Second, Arthur isn't paid very well.

Third, my guess is they're simply *bad with money*. Arthur spends it on old Muggle junk. Molly buys Lockhart books like they're going out of style.

(And fourth, I personally think Molly is a big ol' narcissist. I am NOT a fan of the Weasley parents. Some people thrive on playing "oh, poor me", and enforced poverty seems right up Molly's alley. So they could actually be doing quite well, and she could be exaggerating their poverty because that makes her feel better. It's sick, but some people do stuff like that.) </TEXT>
