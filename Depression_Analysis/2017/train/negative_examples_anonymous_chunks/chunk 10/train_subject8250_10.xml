	<TEXT> Possibly slice mozzarella cheese and put it on top of that! All the cheese might be a bit too much, I'm just trying to think off the top of my head.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks!! Oh jeez, you've got me stumped. I was going to say pita chips, but I guess that constitutes as bread as well. Honestly, if you really feel like eating it and don't have a substitute for bread, you can totally just use a fork/spoon and eat it! My sister dove into it after a while, she couldn't hold back! I hope that helps a bit, I can't think of much else besides bread or some type of chip! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Made a quick feta dip for my sister's birthday! I drowned it in olive oil a bit too much, but it was delicious.

	<TEXT> Exercise. I am by no means fat or overweight, and I've been into athletics and whatnot my whole life. I still to this day hate anything to do with exercising. I do not understand how people find enjoyment from it.  </TEXT>
