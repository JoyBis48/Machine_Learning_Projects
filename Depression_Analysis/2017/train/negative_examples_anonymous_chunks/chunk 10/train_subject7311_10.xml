	<TEXT> Well I'm glad to find someone that shares my enthusiasm! I'm really hoping this isn't a flop; it looks fun and isn't associated with a huge franchise like everything else nowadays!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've really enjoyed the trailers but as far as I'm aware there's not a lot of buzz around this film.. 

Am I wrong? Are there people excited for this movie? Or does this film just look "meh" to others?

	<TEXT> Buried 

ET (I've never watched it.. Hence why I bought it on Blu-Ray) 

Road to Perdition 

The Worlds End

I think there are a couple more.. I buy cheap blurays from CEX that I want to watch, but sometimes I end up going back for more and other films just get left out along the way!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Seeing a lot if these going around lately and got curious! 

*Give Reasons?* It's fun to discuss!

**1.** The Lion King
**2.** Beauty and the Beast
**3.** Princess Mononoke
**4.** The Iron Giant
**5.** Toy Story 

The majority of this list is because I've been watching them since I was a small child. But as I've grown up I appreciate the deeper themes, especially in The Lion King and Toy Story. 

Princess Mononoke introduced me to Studio Ghibli at a later age, and I love the art, the action and the mythology!  </TEXT>
