	<TEXT> They don't owe the IMF $242 billion like your title suggests. 

Greece accepted a loan of 30 billion Euros in 2010 and have been paying it back slowly ever since.

While they did use that 30 billion loan to bail out their banks, Greece still doesn't owe the IMF 242 billion Euros. 

242 billion euros is what Greece owes to all of its creditors, Germany, Spain, the IMF, etc. etc. ... 

I still think its fucked up that they had to take out an IMF loan at a usurious interest rate just to bail out the very banks that were engaging in criminal activity. 

However, this title is still misleading. The original title doesn't even mention the IMF, but it does mention the 242 billion Euro figure, incorrectly suggesting that Greece owes 242 billion to the IMF, which simply isn't true. 

If I left your post up unchecked, without the Misleading Title flair, it would've made the whole sub look bad.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've been waiting for someone to bring up Pennsylvania. Unfortunately it seems like we're going to have to get medicinal cannabis legalized first as a stepping stone to legalization. 

At least now we have a governor in Tom Wolf who has said repeatedly that he would sign a medical cannabis bill if one made it to his desk. Our old governor Tom Corbett has said in the past on numerous occasions that he would veto any sort of cannabis bill presented in front of him, be it recreational or medicinal, that guy was a real dick.  </TEXT>
