You have paypal protection buying that way if you're really concerned. Otherwise, use your credit card for vendor-direct purchases, which gives you charge back protection, though you'll pay extra for it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Let's run the math on a flat 25k contracts.

[One contract = 100 troy ounces](http://www.cmegroup.com/trading/metals/precious/gold_contract_specifications.html)

25,000 contracts x 100 oz = 2,500,000 ozt.

[29,166.6667 ozt in one short ton](https://www.google.com/search?q=how+many+troy+ounces+in+a+ton ie=utf-8 oe=utf-8).

2,500,000 ozt / 29,166.6667 = **85.7 tons**

Is that right? Someone dumped 85 tons of gold? Is my math working out? </TEXT>

Both are good, IMO, but gimme the Bisons.

	<TEXT> They've been selling that for a while. If you're really looking to pick it up, check back with them regularly. It's the lowest premium on a platinum coin I regularly see, though I'd personally rather have a platinum CML on a good deal. The "out of stock" may just be out of stock for this sale, again, I've seen the platypus in their store for a while.

They also have a 1 oz palladium CML.  It was $696 over this weekend, it's up to something like $721 when I was checking their current auctions earlier today. </TEXT>

A lot of front end *whatever* people nowadays *are* formal CS folks. This is the way front end has been moving so expect to see a lot more of this.

Most software "engineers" don't engineer anything, they build things.  The people who write the libraries and frameworks we use, those are typically engineers.  The people who use those libraries and frameworks are typically developers.  People like "engineer" in their job title because it makes them sound more important than they really are. See also "Senior".

At the end of the day, it's just a job title and doesn't matter. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It is getting nearly $800 million dollars from the feds for about 20 passenger rail improvement projects.

Amtrak has cost the government over $45 billion in subsidies over the last 44 years, allowing it to finance the upkeep of unprofitable routes, overstaffed trains, and the mismanagement of its food services.

Despite generous taxpayer subsidies, Amtrak has run operating losses every year since it began operating in 1971. Although these losses are declining, in 2014, the railroad reported what it described as a strong result, with an operating loss of only $227 million.

The operating loss is unlikely to continue to decline due to the losses in Amtraks long-distance routes, which bleed about $600 million annually. After factoring in depreciation and other expenses, Amtrak lost a total of $1.1 billion in 2014. 

Amtrak has had 44 years to become solvent without success.

Decent deals. I'm in the market for the gold eagle (or buff), but I'm holding out hoping for better prices.

I also saw a 1oz palladium CML on Bay Precious Metals ebay if anyone is looking.  Don't know if it's a decent deal, just the first time I noticed them selling palladium.

Anyone know of any other deals this weekend? If so, please list them up.

Never heard of them before and it looks like you have to call to order, so this is a nope for me. If anyone ends up calling, please post up the price for a tube. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You should continue to buy in small amounts according to how much discretionary $ you have.

Don't sell the house and "back up the truck" and use all your $ in one massive purchase.  Buy 20, 40, or 60 ounces today...no big deal.  You're just cost averaging down.

Then wait and see if the paper price goes down into the 14's again and then buy another 20, 40, or whatever fits your budget. 

There's no right or wrong about it as long as you can handle whatever you have purchased in your budget and aren't going to be a fucking cry baby if the price drops a dollar :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Batman is the best JavaScript framework!

There's also AngularJS which is similar to Ember.js but they have different names. Backbone and Cappuccino are similar in that they start only one letter apart from each other. Chaplin should get an honorary mention since we're in the C's. There is also EXT JS which literally shouts at you about how good it is, unlike Meteor and React, let alone SproutCore.  JavaScript MVC is near the top of the list as well because just by the name you know it's related to javascript.

But Batman is the best.

Also, if you have a cat, try hitting it on the head with the bar.  I can assure you cats do not like getting hit in the head with a silver bar.  If you don't believe me, try it multiple times.  Bottom line: If the cat doesn't like it, the bar is legit. </TEXT>
