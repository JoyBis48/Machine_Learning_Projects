TRUST ME: they truly sucked. And were officious jerks.  At least with TSA, you see some glimmers of professionalism.

Don't forget: private security companies like Argenbright and their ilk in NYC and Boston were the ones that let boxcutters and skeevy people onto the 9/11 flights.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You're missing my point -- the private security agents could do whatever they wanted.  

At least now they're somewhat accountable.

However I don't think a machete would've been allowed pre-9/11.  I flew from San Diego to DC in the 70's and I remember I took a clock radio with me.  They made me plug it in at the gate to make sure it worked.  I was perhaps a 12 year old boy. 

I live in DC now.  I hate the security theater.  Coming back from a Nationals game last month, there were all these DHS paramilitary police in black in the Metro.  WTF?!!!

But better them than the Argenbright Security Barney Fifes. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't think that's true.  Dialing 1 means securing an international line.

Maybe things are different now, but I grew up in the 70's and you would dial 1 for the international line, then country code, then the local number.

I have never been as proud of him as I was that afternoon.

Holy crap you're right, and they still seemed to have had trouble listing the clones properly:

 Tatiana Maslany
as Alison/ Cosima/ Helena/ Rachel and Krystal/ Sarah

Why the "and" in there?  For when one clone pretended to be another?

They missed the transgendered clone, too, but maybe he didn't appear in season 3?
