	<TEXT> I know this came out 24 years ago but I think it still applies, 1991's Career Opportunities. A nice little comedy i just saw on tv the other day starring Jennifer Connelly and Frank whaley, and written by John Hughes. Reception seems mixed to the film, but being someone who grew up watching John Hughes on vhs and dvd I'm surprised I never heard of this one because to me it's a good film. Not as good as something like Ferris Bueller but I'd still recommend a watch. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The only way I can agree with that headline is if "hungry for more" is followed by "new games".  I just don't see how an improved framerate and resolution warrants excitement for a game that came out almost six years ago.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You have a good point, Columbus knows what's he's doing. I think it's just my bias against Sandler speaking. But who knows, maybe the film  will meet the production value of its budget. We'll just have to wait and see.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I doubt a majority of that 110 million is actually going towards the movie. I say that because Jack and Jill had a **$80M** budget, and that film looks nowhere close to that figure.

	<TEXT> That's because Ubisoft delivered an inferior game than what they promoted. Bugs, downgrades, a story that's so meaningless that one of the "story" missions serves no purpose other than to introduce the multiplayer features of the game. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I know they've said this times before, but it's been almost ten years since Bully came out. I want another one. I know everyone wants another Red Dead. But Bully came first, and I think they should work on that. Ten years, man. I first played it in elementary school, and now I'm in college. I mean I know it's been five since Red Dead came out, but the gap between Revolver and Redemption was only like six years. I think the world can wait a little longer for some western action. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Alright, I seen the movie twice now and I'm still digging it. The only thing that stood out to me was after Max kills the blind warlord. After Max kills him and the rest of the party continue through the area it cuts to black. I'm bringing this up because it felt unnatural, like they cut out a scene. Did anyone else notice this? To be more precise it's exactly after you see those guys dressed like crows walking around on pogo sticks. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 2008's Alone in the Dark. The gameplay is kinda clunky, the voice acting and characters are not that great, and the story is cliche. But I love it because the game itself is fun to play. The inventory system is unique because you can combine all sorts of different items your guy is carrying with you and the game's set pieces are exciting. It's like a B movie if it was given the budget of a major blockbuster. </TEXT>
