	<TEXT> Being at the front for Kendrick a few hours early,  I got to see Alabama Shakes real close up. Being that close, I also was touching the VIP walkway. I had been keeping my eyes peeled for a few celebs to maybe have their fame melt off onto me, but ended up forgetting about that for a bit. That was until a man walked by in overalls and a straw hat, a man I immediately recognized as Matt Shultz from Cage the Elephant, one of my favorite fucking bands. I screamed,  CAGE THE ELEPHANT after he had passed and he turned around and gave me a huge smile and pumped his fists. I also yelled I FUCKING LOVE YOU and he did another wave. That was pretty fucking cool. Then Chance the Rapper walked by and high-fived me.  </TEXT>
