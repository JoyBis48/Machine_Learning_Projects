	<TEXT> I wouldn't say arbitrary, but heuristic. Scientists reject hypotheses that cannot be disproved, support hypotheses which have historically been successful at prediction, choose between different models by null hypothesis testing, AIC, BIC, maximum likelihood, maximum parsimony, maximum a posteriori probability, various regularization methods, and have heuristics such as Occam's Razor. As a culture, scientists converge on particular epistemological heuristics for assessing potential models. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I qualified for USAMO twice, though was never good enough to move beyond that. I started in between 7th and 8th grade, it took me 1 year to qualify for Mathcounts Nationals, and 1 year to narrowly miss the USAMO cutoff (was 1 AIME problem away). Didn't do well the following year, but qualified for USAMO the next two. My best Putnam performance was my first year in college, and declined after that since I got more rusty over time. I'm from a non-competitive region, so Art of Problem Solving was my main resource.

The first two years were spent going through the first two volumes of Art of Problem Solving, participating in the forums, doing practice tests, and doing competitions like AMC12, AIME, ARML, USAMTS, AoPS mock tests. AoPS has done a great job of democratizing the math scene by giving access to people who don't have local resources like math circles or strong math teams. I spent hours every day those first two years practicing or learning theory and tricks. I'd say it takes about 2+-1 year to get to a level where you can qualify for USAMO and maybe even solve 1 or 2 questions on USAMO, but to get the point where the first 1 or 2 questions on USAMO can be done in a few minutes so you have enough time to solve the rest of them, and can do it consistently with speed, takes years of additional practice. The people who are USAMO winners and IMO team members have probably put in a good 4-7 years of hard practice and over 10,000 hours.

Solving Olympiad problems is a matter of building requisite insight. The problems cover geometry (euclidean, projective, inversive), number theory, inequalities, probability, algebra, trigonometry, complex numbers, combinatorics and a few other subjects; calculus, statistics, and higher (undergraduate+graduate) mathematics are not required, though they can certainly be useful. Some of these topics aren't covered in high school or even many undergraduate curriculums. There's a kinda standard corpora of theorems and tricks and problem construction ideas that are common in contest problems, ranging from necessary even at the lowest level competitions to fairly advanced or obscure. However, combining these techniques to solve Olympiad problems is non-trivial and requires experience and insight. There is a kinda meta-gaming in that, unlike research problems, Olympiad problems have a solution of an expected level of difficulty, and there is kinda a limit to the breadth of problems that can be proposed, so familiarity with lots of problems is definitely helpful. At the same time, Olympiad contest writers must think of newer problems which aren't as easily solved by knowing similar past problems, so the meta-game moves forward over time--the present is always the time where the most past problems are available to students to study. The best problem-solvers have built great depth and breadth in the techniques, theorems, and problems they have in the back of their minds over many years of practice. They're self-motivated to do well and very passionate and generally start early, but there have been some people who have started later who have done very well. </TEXT>

Yup. But there are dozens of labels that are more informative and therefore should be prioritized over GMO labelling. The irony of your comment is that saying something is that labelling something as GMO or Non-GMO is very ambiguous. From the article: 

 GMO labels dont clarify whats in your food. They dont address the underlying ingredientspesticides, toxins, proteinsthat supposedly make GMOs harmful. They stigmatize food thats perfectly safe, and they deflect scrutiny from non-GMO products that have the same disparaged ingredients. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Patents and stopping farmers from planting seeds from crops they grow are the more scary side of the GMO industry.

But this is true of hybrid crop seed as well, farmers in general have been using commercial seed since before the discovery of DNA.

  the whole article seems to fall foul of the same cherry picking it accuses others off and seems to imply all GMO products are safe and the health benefits/risks seemed overplayed.

To quote the thesis of the article:

 The more you learn about herbicide resistance, the more you come to understand how complicated the truth about GMOs is. First you discover that they arent evil. Then you learn that they arent perfectly innocent. Then you realize that nothing is perfectly innocent. Pesticide vs. pesticide, technology vs. technology, risk vs. riskits all relative. The best you can do is measure each practice against the alternatives. The least you can do is look past a three-letter label.

So I think your claim is unfair, the article is arguing for nuance, and exposes hypocrisy in the dogma of a particular brand of anti-GMO organization. The article addresses the main classes of GMOs, of which there aren't actually that many: there are insecticide producing GMs, herbicide resistant GMs, individual disease immune GMs, and humanitarian efforts to increase yield, nutrition, and drought resistance. The only type of GM that I can think of off the top of my head that wasn't covered are the FlavrSavr tomatoes with increased shelf-life from the 90s. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A nice way to see this is a geometric interpretation of multiple regression. Let there be N samples, and M predictors X1, ..., XM, and response Y. Each of X1, ..., XM and Y are vectors in the vector space V = R^N. The M predictors X1, ..., XM span a subspace U with at most M dimensions (if linearly independent) but possibly less. The estimator Yhat is the vector in U that minimizes the euclidean distance to Y, i.e. it's the orthogonal projection of Y onto U. Since Y = Yhat+residual, the residual vector lies in the orthogonal complement of U, which has dimension at least N-M (equal to N-M if linearly independent); this is the degrees of freedom.

	<TEXT> There's probably a lot of talent that slips through, but that's true of any competition, whether sport, music, or math. Local opportunities (good high school math teams, good local math circles, high concentrations of mathletes) is a big factor. The online community ArtOfProblemSolving has done a lot to democratize the process, it's much easier for students in non-competitive areas to join the community. The most important factor is still practice and determination.

The selection process is pretty complicated:

 The American Invitational Mathematics Examination (AIME) is a 15-question 3-hour test given since 1983 to those who rank in the top 5% (or score at least 100) on the AMC 12 high school mathematics contest (formerly known as the AHSME), and starting in 2010, those who rank in the top 2.5% (or score at least 120) on the AMC 10.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Invitational_Mathematics_Examination

 AMC 12 based indices are determined by taking AMC 12 Score + 10*(AIME Score). AMC 10 based indices are determined by taking AMC 10 Score + 10*(AIME Score). Cutoffs, based on AMC 12 indices, are determined so that approximately 260-270 students qualify for the USAMO. Cutoffs, based on AMC 10 indices, are determined so that approximately 230-240 students qualify for the USAJMO. If a student took the AMC 10 and 12 (i.e. AMC 10A and 12B or AMC 12A and 10B) and qualified for both the USAMO and USAJMO, the student must take the USAMO.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_of_America_Mathematical_Olympiad#Present

 The main purpose of MOP, held since 1974, is to select and train the six members of the U.S. team for the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO). Students qualify for the program by taking the United States of America Mathematical Olympiad (USAMO). The top twelve American scorers from all grades form the "black" group. The approximately eighteen next highest American scorers among students from 11th grade and under form the "blue" group. In 2004, the program was expanded to include approximately thirty of the highest-scoring American freshmen and sophomores each year, the "red" group; this was later split into two, forming the "green" group, which consists of approximately fifteen of the highest-scoring freshmen and sophomores who have qualified through the USAMO, and the "red" group, which consists of those who have qualified through the USAJMO. The colorful designations of these groups were adapted from Karate. In 2013, the red and green groups were unified. Also, with the new system the Black Group includes more or less only the IMO team, which is not necessarily all USAMO winners.

 Until 2011, only Black MOPpers were eligible for the selection to the USA IMO team, determined by combining USAMO results with results of a similar exam called the Team Selection Test (TST). From 2011, a new test called the Team Selection Test Selection Test (TSTST) was established; this test is open for any of the participants of MOP, and along with results from the USAMO, determines the students who take the TSTs. This ultimately, along with the USAMO and MOP tests, determines the IMO team.

	<TEXT> It takes resources to maintain a body part that isn't useful, energy and resources that could be better used for building and maintaining other tissues and organs. So it's better to lose them, or coopt them for a new function. Neutral variation is more common at the molecular level. Development is all about trade-offs. </TEXT>
