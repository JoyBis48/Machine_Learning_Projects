	<TEXT> They sure are, but the second half of Man in the Iron Mask felt a bit too depressing for me, I'm still a bit bummed out from it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hmm, maybe, but the last time the two meet Aramis is described as a frail old man, and he even says goodbye saying he will die soon. 

I have a feeling d'Artagnan may have been condemning Aramis for some of the things he did, especially being responsible for Porthos's death, but I can't be sure. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The book ends just after d'Artagnan's final words:

"AthosPorthos, farewell till we meet again! Aramis, adieu forever!" 

I'm not sure how to interpret this, is he making the distinction between Aramis and the others because Aramis is the only one still alive, or because he doesn't think he will be seeing Aramis in the afterlife like the others? Anyone have a take on this? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Actually it looks like they just took Portuguese names for whales (since this was in Brazil, as she said) and threw them in google translate. We call one type of whale the ["baleia-franca"](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baleia-franca) which would literately translate to "frank-whale". There's also the[ "baleia-cinzenta"](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baleia-cinzenta) which I could see someone translating as "grayish-whale". </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  "One day," you said to me, "I saw the sunset forty-four times!"
 
 And a little later you added:
 
 "You know-- one loves the sunset, when one is so sad..."
 
 "Were you so sad, then?" I asked, "on the day of the forty-four sunsets?"
 
 But the little prince made no reply </TEXT>

They should have gone with "100% of math graduates can't solve this,"  would be a perfectly correct thing to say.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  The BS part was that both Brazil and Spain were included, but not Portugal. 

Brazil shouldn't be included, Hispanic and Latino are defined by the US government as "a person of Cuban, Mexican, Puerto Rican, South or Central American (except for Brazil), or other Spanish culture or origin regardless of race." They specifically exclude Brazil. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My less than 2 years old build is basically i5-4570, 650w PSU, 8GB and GTX760.

I'm looking forward to VR headsets but apparently my PC wouldn't quite cut it. Can I upgrade my GTX760 to a 970 and expect enough performance or would I also need to upgrade something/everything else?

Thanks. </TEXT>
