	<TEXT>  Pixar movies have always done that. Cartoonish characters on realistic backgrounds. 

But there is something about the background here in "The Good Dinosaur" that seems more real than it usually does. When you look at the trees, grass, water, mountains, and everything else it looks so much more real than it usually does in a Pixar movie. I mean not even the coral reef in Finding Nemo looked as real as the background in this trailer did (at least in my opinion). The contrast with this real background compared to the dinosaur really bothered me. Maybe the lack of dialog had me focusing on the background more than usual, or maybe it was the fact that the dinosaur is so cartoonish that he seemed out of place. I don't know. 

Other than that I liked the trailer. No plot given away, just music and scenes of a (possible?) budding friendship. It actually made me more interested in the movie.

His father is from Jordan so he likely went (possibly under the ruse) to see extended family and then snuck into nearby Syria or Iraq (this is of course assuming that the guy carried this out in the name of radical Islam, while all initial signs point to that there is still no statement from the FBI on why he did this). Also Jordan is one of the U.S.'s allies in the Middle East, it isn't crawling with terrorist groups like Syria, Afghanistan, or Iraq so visiting there wouldn't raise any red flags.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I know, unfortunately the GOP has run a successful union busting ring here for the past 50 years. The regional airlines here are separate companies that use non union pilots and are contracted out by the big 3 airlines (Delta, United, and American) to fly smaller planes ([40 to 80 seat planes like this](http://www.flugzeuginfo.net/acimages/crj700er_kp.jpg)) from their hubs to small cities, think Chicago to Green Bay. They are staffed by pilots just out of flight school so they are desperate to get their "dream job" and go to work for regional airlines because the larger ones won't hire you out of flight school. The regional airlines know that they don't have to pay a high salary because there are plenty of eager pilots in line to get a job. In a perfect world you spend a few years flying for a regional airline then get hired by the Delta's, United's, Southwest's and JetBlue's of the world. But that doesn't always happen.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They are probably employed by a company called Veritas that AT T hired to do door to door sales for them. I know this because I applied for a "Management Trainee" job at that company a few months back. I went to the initial interview and was invited back for a 7 hour "day in the life" event to see how the company operatives and was told it would be business professional. Get there having no clue what to expect. Told to go with this guy and  this girl (the girl had only been there a week). It quickly became clear what this job really was. I felt like an absolute idiot for not picking up on the red flags sooner, I had just graduated college so I was desperate and didn't think. So here I was walking around the poor/lower middle class part Akworth in dress shoes and a suit all day in the May sun sweating my ass off doing nothing but watching these people try to sell AT T U-verse to people who can't afford it. The whole thing was BS. The guy even said to the new girl "don't sell the cheap package sell the expensive one". And the whole spiel they gave to people was complete BS too.  Like you said, given a huge list of addresses in a certain area and have to cover it multiple times to make sure you catch the person.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Like /u/Coup_Soup said it's to make sure that you catch a person while they're home. Plus in some cases the person that answers the door will say that "I don't handle that stuff, so-and-so does. They'll be here around _____" so you go back to ask the "person in charge".  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Holtz retired, May is still under contract with ESPN, Cowherd probably got a better offer from Fox, Olbermann left because ESPN wanted to censor his criticism of the NFL, and Simmons was a mix of wanting too much money and ESPN trying to censor him from criticizing the NFL and ESPN personalities/shows *cough* First Take *cough* .

	<TEXT> They are also in the process of budget tightening. They have lots of personalities contract's coming up this year, so it's all about choosing who is worth paying. Simmons was a case of wanting too much money and being critical of the NFL, Olbermann was being too critical of the NFl, and now Cowherd is probably wanting too much money. FWIW they have already resigned Stephen A. Smith to a new contract.

	<TEXT> The Duggars are huge anti-gay bigots. They were instrumental in getting an LGBT non-discrimination ordinance in Fayetteville, Arkansas repealed last year. They said that Trans people were child molesters, which is ironic since their son was a child molester.
