	<TEXT> A buddy of mine got me a job at a movie theater and I met this beautiful girl that most of the guys who worked there had tried to date. Well after a month or two of carefully laying ground work to ask her out on a date she goes off to college. Well we lose touch but she comes back for Christmas break and it's like she never left. I finally get her to come over to my place we are laying on my floor listening to dispatch and we start making out. We have been dating for almost 2 years and I am counting down the days until I can ask her to marry me. </TEXT>

It's a bit hit or miss though, if you are unlucky it can be a slog or over too quickly, and if anyone isn't into the game they can easily ruin it for everyone else. </TEXT>
