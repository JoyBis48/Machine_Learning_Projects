	<TEXT> the first moon landing, Apollo 11, was certainly broadcast far and wide. But NASA only allowed the TV stations to film from their screen (instead of allowing the "news" stations to have a direct feed)--which made the film very grainy. 

as for your "rockstar" quote--Joe Rogan made a good point about the moon landing being a Technological God, something that no one is allowed to question. Others question the God Box--the TV--even Bill Clinton had a quote in his book in which Clinton himself questioned the moon landing by Apollo 11. 

The "press conference" the Apollo 11 astronauts held a few weeks after they came back is quite odd. In the Q   A portion a member of the audience asks the Apollo 11 team if they could comment on the long-term impact of their moon landing. Neil Armstrong (who spoke the famous "One small step for man, a giant leap for mankind") acts as if he doesn't want to answer the question and ends up going last.  Armstrong earlier had claimed he thought up those Historic Words during the trip--but in the Q   A Armstrong is tongue-tied and acts as if he is sitting at the defendant's table of a criminal court proceeding. Armstrong also retired from NASA after the "moon landing" and only gave a few interviews.

Look at how excited and giddy with JOY the Apollo 11 crew is at the press conference: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKl_oXxsQiA

WHY doesn't Neil Armstrong smile and shout out loud "We went to the moon!!!"

Instead he avoids using those words and calls the the moon landing an "adventure"

	<TEXT> BONUS: the 9/11 Commission DC offices were in a CIA managed office building (rent-free, of course)...oh wait--didn't the CIA get busted spying on the SSCI? How hard could it have been for them to spy on the 9/11 Commission?

-----------------

from Page 84 of *The Commission: The Uncensored History of the 9/11 Investigation* by Philip Shenon (2008):

The offices were in a seemingly undistinguished nine-floor federal building between the White House and Georgetown. The building was secretly owned and operated by the CIA, used as downtown office space by the agency. It was ideal for the commission because it qualified as a so-called SCIF, the acronym for secure compartmentalized information facility, which meant that it had security measures that allowed for the storage of highly classified documents. Apart from witnesses called to private interviews from the commission, only people with security clearances would be allowed to enter the commission's offices; all cell phones and other electronic devices had to be left at the door. Each of the staff members at K Street was provided with two computer hard drives--one for classified information, one for unclassified information. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> there is NOTHING in our lifetimes that has affected the entire planet more than 9/11...TRILLIONS of dollars poured out into the (MIP)^2 Complex.^#

highly recommend you watch [KILL THE MESSENGER](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT4pgoc6-0M) (made in Australia) which reports how Sibel Edmonds sent shockwaves thru the FBI, DoD, CIA, AIPAC, defense corporations, the 9/11 Commission--and the NeoCons.

pre-9/11 is interesting too: Operation Darkheart (DIA)...the warning which the U.S. supposedly gave to Afghanistan: it will either rain money or you will have bombs dropped on you (the energy companies wanted a pipeline built and needed Taliban approval...eventually Hamid Karzai, a former UNOCAL exec, was placed in charge of Afghanistan) see: http://whatreallyhappened.com/WRHARTICLES/oil.html

even Kenneth Feinberg is suspicious: he wrote an early version of what would become the Patriot Act--then he became the head of the 9/11 Victims Compensation Fund...was the intention to pay off the families and shut them up via the non-disclosure agreement?

Cryptome: What will this be used for?

A: It depends on who the user is. Law enforcement and private investigators will use the information to try to:

1. Identify individuals based on behavioral analysis of comments, etc.

2. De-anonymize individuals and leverage this information on other platforms, i.e. checking identical/similar usernames and using the behavioral analysis to predict other (online or offline) hangouts and activities in order to build a more complete picture.

Sociologists and psychologists will use it to build behavioral models for individuals acting as individuals and for ad-hoc groups of individuals without any external organization, goal, etc.

Members of the public and historians will use it to look at and for public figures and to better understand them. More importantly, the public should use this database as a wake-up call that the driving force behind Big Data isn't Big Brother - it's the masses. Between this and the Dark Net Market archives and some other releases in the last few weeks, it's becoming more apparent that the "right to be forgotten" may be recognized by some governments but private individuals and researchers, not just megacorps, remain major obstacles to it.

This is, simply put, the biggest example of open source SIGINT to date. The fact that it was done legally and openly, and not as the result of a hack or data leak, may make it seem less newsworthy - but if anything, it makes even more alarming to privacy advocates. It's not a one-off either, it's just one of the biggest signposts we've seen so far.

If the mods want to SLAM a post (keep it from the top position): The mods will MANIPULATE the posts at the top of the page--first, by inserting a post into the Top 5 and then add points to it to PASS the post which offends them...if a post does happen to reach the Top Post position which the mods don't like--they will turn the counter off early and make the post slide back down.

WhoWhatWhy has discovered that scores of young people have been denied their freedomand their Constitutional right to a speedy and public trialwhile being held in Chicago jails, some of them for years.

A Freedom of Information Act request revealed that dozens of detainees who were under the age of 18 when they were booked have been incarcerated for more than two yearssimply because they couldnt post bail while awaiting trial. Thirty one juveniles have been held for at least two years and another 33 have been awaiting their trial in jail for more than a year. Twelve have been in detention for three years or more.

The findings are part of a WhoWhatWhy investigation into the treatment of teenagers who are sitting in the nations jails because they cannot afford bail. The probe was triggered by the suicide of Kalief Browder.

The story of Kalief Browdera 16 year-old who was imprisoned for three years after being unable to come up with thousands of dollars in bail after allegedly stealing a $40 backpackcast a harsh light on New Yorks grievously flawed bail system.

While New York City announced this month that it would no longer require bail for suspects accused of low-level or non-violent crimes, this revamp doesnt go in effect until next year, likely leaving many minors to languish in prison while awaiting trial.

Worse, other cities continue to operate similarly flawed justice systems whose excesses have gone largely unscrutinized, until now.

Chicago is one of those cities, as revealed by a WhoWhatWhy Freedom of Information request. While Chicagos Cook County Sheriffs Office does not collect data on specifically why such detainees remain in jail, a follow-up with a Sheriffs Office official confirmed that it is fair to assume that individuals in the jail who remain in custody despite being given a cash bond are unable to afford to post the required amount.

The data from Chicago suggest that Kalief Browders case is not a tragic anomaly but an indicator of a larger, perhaps nationwide pattern. While we do not have information on the alleged crimes of the Cook County Jail detainees, we do know that they all received a set bail, and that bail is only set for individuals who are not considered a significant danger to the community.

We are continuing to investigate how Chicagos juvenile justice system compares to New Yorks. WhoWhatWhy has submitted a Freedom of Information request and is still awaiting a response from Laura Mello, the Freedom of Information Law Officer for the Department of Corrections, City of New York.

	<TEXT> I remember him from the *News Radio* comedy series on nbc, then the UFC...I was also first against the MMA when it first came out, but grew to like it and have watched it up until about 3 or 4 years ago. 

As for Rogan being a propaganda agent--I'd think it is far more likely he has been approached and commanded not to say too much regarding certain subjects. By agreeing (or being forced to agree) that would make him a propaganda agent. 

Alex Jones has made his Topic #1 OKC and 9/11 from Day 1, while Rogan is more of a conversationalist with jokes, drugs, and a truth chaser. Jones now presents everything as News and Editorial--attacking the NWO. I wouldn't doubt if Jones is seriously fucked with by the USG and pressured not to report on certain subjects. For example, infowars was all over the Boston Bombing from Day 1--then during the trial they were completely silent and only published an article from whowhatwhy.com until after the trial. Jones has also added a lot of main stream media links to his webpage--most likely to keep from getting fucked by google searches and the threat of losing his press pass...(Never really looked too close at Jones--I find him a bit abrasive). </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Victor Bout Theories... </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-07-15 06:17:30 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I think it may have been a missile that hit the Pentagon on 9/11...it's possible Israel (with the OK from the CIA-Wall Street) bought the missile from Victor Bout with the intention being to set up the Russians as having sold Al Qaeda a missile...maybe Victor Bout recorded his deal with the Israelis--so they had to get Bout outside of Russia to set him up and take him out of circulation...(maybe the video of Bout selling the Israelis the missile is the only thing keeping him alive).

I just have a feeling Deep in my gut that the U.S. was scared shitless by Victor Bout--the whole extradition seemed to be much more than some Russian arms dealer selling weaponry around the globe.

------------------

(from wikipedia, link below)

Viktor Anatolyevich Bout (Russian:   ) was born 13 January 1967, near Dushanbe, Tajik SSR, Soviet Union.

A citizen of Russia, he was arrested in Thailand in 2008 before being extradited in 2010 to the United States to stand trial on terrorism charges after having been accused of intending to smuggle arms to the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) to use against U.S. forces.[1][2][3] On 2 November 2011, he was convicted by a jury in a Manhattan federal court of conspiracy to kill U.S. citizens and officials, delivery of anti-aircraft missiles, and providing aid to a terrorist organization.[4][5]

A former Soviet military translator,[6] Bout had reportedly made a significant amount of money through his multiple air transport companies,[7] which shipped cargo mostly in Africa and the Middle East during the 1990s and early 2000s.[8] As willing to work for Charles Taylor in Liberia as he was for the United Nations in Sudan and the United States in Iraq,[7][9] Bout may have facilitated huge arms shipments into various civil wars in Africa with his private air cargo fleets during the 1990s.[10]

Bout says he has done little more than provide logistics, but former British Foreign Office minister Peter Hain called Bout a "sanctions buster"[7] and described him as "the principal conduit for planes and supply routes that take arms from east Europe, principally Bulgaria, Moldova and Ukraine, to Liberia and Angola".[11]

In cooperation with American authorities,[9] Royal Thai Police arrested Bout in Bangkok, Thailand, in 2008.[12] The United States ambassador requested his extradition under the Extradition Act between the Kingdom of Thailand and the United States, which was eventually mandated by the Thai High Court in August 2010.[3] Before his extradition to the United States in November 2010, he expressed confidence that this U.S. trial would eventually lead to his acquittal but this did not occur.[13][14][15] From January 2011 to June 2012 Bout was incarcerated in the Metropolitan Correctional Center, New York City.[citation needed] Following his conviction, he was sentenced on 5 April 2012 to 25 years imprisonment by a U.S. judge. In June 2012 he was transferred to the United States Penitentiary, Marion, Illinois.[16][17][18][19]

	<TEXT> Wow--never saw that Pat Tillman death info...Michael Ruppert said Tillman was shot in the forehead--but then seemed to indicate Tillman was a Hot Shot looking to win a medal (so his own crew took him out). Ruppert has stood by that version--its on Truth tv and on his Joe Rogan interview...

Odd that Joe Rogan has rolled back and no longer openly states "NASA didn't go to the moon"...In Rogan's interview with Neil de Grasse Tyson, Rogan definitely backtracks from his previous position. He argues just as a counter-argument (stating he doesn't believe it anymore) and still leaves Neil De Grasse Tyson looking like a fool quite a few times.

I could see that young cop being a PsyOp--and I could see Rogan having to make deals with the Pentagon (who sponsored lots of  MMA). I wouldn't doubt if about 1/3 of Rogan's audience are military. </TEXT>

To be clear: I think it may have been a missile...it's possible Israel (with the OK from the CIA-Wall Street) bought the missile from Victor Bout with the intention being to set up the Russians as having sold Al Qaeda a missile...maybe Victor Bout recorded his deal with the Israelis--so they had to get Bout outside of Russia to set him up and take him out of circulation...(maybe the video of Bout selling the Israelis the missile is the only thing keeping him alive).

	<TEXT> Allen Dulles at the CIA actually handled quite a bit of it by networking with the publishers and editors (*NYT*, Time, CBS, etc...)...By the 1970's, the CIA also Bought plenty of journalists as well (see Carl Bernstein's 1976 *Rolling Stone* article "The CIA and the Media")...

J. Edgar Hoover (FBI) was also networked--mostly with smaller newspapers...but both the CIA and FBI eventually made Hollywood sing their tune as well...Today, the Pentagon helps fund and often OKs the scripts of films--Top Gun, Pearl Harbor, Transformers, Black Hawk Down, etc...The FBI began their Hollywood propaganda way back in the 1930's...

The media have turned into conglomerates--so no one wants to publish stories which will end up hurting their subsidiaries...Going back to WWII, NBC was owned by RCA (which owned companies that made radio equipment for the military)...

Today, no one wants to investigate the missing $9 TRILLION at the Pentagon because: 1) it is expensive to conduct investigations; 2) the reporter could be killed like Michael Hastings; 3) the corporate board likely all invest in defense/intelligence corporations. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Recently watched *Kubrick's Odyssey* and *Room 237*...sounds like Alice (Bill's wife) may have had some relevant scenes cut out (possibly involving the man she dances with...possibly there was a dream sequence where she was also at the illuminati/orgy party)...also: the very end does show their daughter possibly being taken by 2 men (who appeared earlier in the background of the film) while they are at the toy store...

A couple things I noticed: while many people have mentioned the use of light bulbs in the background of "The Shining"--SK uses the light bulbs in almost every second of EWS. The light bulbs are supposed to represent the Scotch/Front Screen process which SK used in filming 2001 (and possibly to film the Fake Moon Landing). The lights, obviously have other allusions--but to use light bulbs in almost every second of EWS, and in such an over-the-top manner, seems to be screaming "LOOK--have you ever seen so many X-mas lights in a film?"

The other thing which stands out is that it is X-mas, yet there is NO SNOW...even though it is late December you cannot see anyone's breath or see car exhaust--not even a frosted window...the landscape looks more like fall than december...interesting that the college kids who push Bill around while he is walking--at least one of them has on a Yale sweatshirt (cough cough).

--------------

edit: re-watched EWS--all six of the drunken idiots who yell/push Bill have some type of Yale swag on them--one has a Yale varsity-style jacket, the rest of them have Yale sweatshirts (some underneath coats) and few of them have Y baseball hats on. (guess who played first base for Yale in the late 40's--GHWB) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I definitely feel your frustration, but The Cabal rules the media--they can sell any lie (or just force the media not to cover a story). Once in a while the media breaks a story--but ultimately there is no meaningful follow-up. Case in point: June 28th (a saturday) the Wash Post broke a story accusing the CIA of withholding 14,000 photos from evidence--no major network has followed up...

Even if there is an official congressional investigation--it ends up as controlled opposition (a Farce).  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Actually, there is quite a bit of evidence that the Cold War was mostly **THREAT INFLATION**.

-----------

**Q: Its 1961, the height of the Cold War, the U.S. has 40 nuclear-capable Inter Continental Ballistic Missiles--how many ICBMs did the Soviets have?**

According to Daniel Ellsbergs *SECRETS: A Memoir of Vietnam and the Pentagon Papers* (2002):

However, in the fall of 1961 a highly secret, dramatically revised national intelligence estimate turned the strategic world that had preoccupied me for three years upside down. The missile gap favoring the Soviets had been a fantasy. There was a gap, all right, but it was currently ten to one in our favor. Our 40 Atlas and Titan ICBMs were matched by 4 Soviet SS-6 ICBMs at one launching site at Plesetsk, not by 120, as in the latest national estimate in June, or by the SAC commanders estimate of 1,000 I had heard of at SAC headquarters in August. The specter of a deliberate Soviet surprise attack suddenly appeared, with the new estimates, to have been a chimera. 

...the new estimate was kept effectively secret from Congress, the press, and the public, and it had a comparably imperceptible effect on military programs. It was after this secret recognition that the Soviets  had deployed four liquid-fueled ICBMs to our forty that the Kennedy administration decided, in the late fall of 1961, on the appropriate size for the projected force of U.S. solid-fueled Minuteman missiles: one thousand. That was less than the 1,600 to 6,000 that the air force had earlier requested, but it was down only to the level that Secretary McNamara had earlier decided on *before* the new estimate. (pages 32-33)


------------------------

The 6 paragraphs below are taken from Chapter 7 of a free online book *The Pentagon Labyrinth* (2011). Full article "Follow the Money" by Andrew Cockburn (2011): http://pogoarchives.org/labyrinth/07-cockburn-w-covers.pdf

------------------------------

Recall that following victory in World War II, the U.S. rapidly disarmed, disbanding its huge conscript army and slashing weapons production. The economies of our allies and enemies in the recent conflict lay in total ruin. Although the Soviet Union controlled eastern European states overrun by the Red Army during the war, this was by prior agreement with the U.S. and Britain. Suddenly, in the spring of 1948, senior officials of the Truman Administration suddenly began issuing ominous warnings that the Soviet Union was bent on war and might attack at any time. A warning to that effectwar could come at any timewas solicited by the chief of army intelligence from the U.S. commander in Germany, General Lucius Clay, and duly leaked to the press.

Why?

The answer is clear for anyone who remembers to follow the money. The aircraft corporations who had garnered enormous profits during the war on the back of government contracts had discovered by 1947 that **peace was ruinous**. Despite initial high hopes, the commercial marketplace was proving a far harsher and less accommodating environment than that of wartime, especially as there were far more companies than required by the peacetime economy. Orders from the civilian airline industry never lived up to expectations while efforts to diversify into other products, including dishwashers and stainless steel coffins, proved disappointing and costly.

Something had to be done. In the spring of 1948 senior officials in the Truman Administration, including Secretary of Defense James Forrestal, suddenly began warning that the Soviets were on the brink of unleashing a surprise military attack against Western Europe. There was **no evidence** that the Soviets had any such intentions, a point, as declassified documents now make clear, that was well known to the senior officials. In fact Stalin, the Soviet leader, was enjoining the powerful western European communist parties from any revolutionary action and refusing to aid the Greek communists in their civil war against the U.S.-backed government.

This cause (need for stimulus in the aerospace industry) and effect (war scare leading to sharp increase in defense appropriations) was pithily summed up at the time by Lawrence D. Bell, President of the Bell Aircraft Corporation: As soon as there is a war scare, there is a lot of money available. And so it proved. The aircraft procurement budget soared **57**% as the overall Pentagon procurement budget exploded by almost **600** percent from less than $6 billion in 1947 to more than $35 billion in 1948 (in contemporary 2011 dollars). The industry, not to mention powerful institutions linked to its fortunes, such as **major banks**, was saved from collapse.

Apart from a brief relapse pending the outbreak of the Korean war in 1950, war scares, otherwise known as **threat inflation** would thereafter be a regular feature of the U.S. political and economic landscape. It mattered little what the Soviet enemy was actually doing, or in a position to do. All that was required was for an announcement that intelligence had revealed an ominous gap between U.S. and Soviet capabilities, and the money flowed. The missile gap on which John F. Kennedy rode to victory in 1960 yielded an immediate fifteen percent hike in defense spending. Years after the money had been appropriated and spent, **it was openly admitted by the relevant defense secretary, Robert McNamara, that in fact the gap had been entirely in favor of the U.S.** Similar, if less infamous episodes recurred featuring bombers, tanks, ships, anti-ballistic missiles and, most comprehensively, defense budgets themselves.

Embarrassing realities, such as serious shortcomings in our putative enemies capabilities, have generally been kept out of sight of the taxpayers. Equally, explosive cost overruns and technical disasters generate, at most, short term scandals. Pleas to cut the defense budget have rarely yielded much of a political dividend. Indeed, in former days, the very size of the budget, irrespective of its components, was touted as a necessary part of our deterrent. One of the more successful gaps of the cold war years was the greater size of the Soviet defense budget. **The Soviets didnt announce how much they were spending on defense** (even if they knew the real cost themselves, which is dubious); so the figure publicized by the military industrial complex was based on an ersatz calculation of the presumed cost to the Soviets of duplicating U.S. programs and systems. I.E., the cost of a Soviet swing-wing bomber would be assessed on the basis of the cost of a similar U.S. effort. Therefore, as Ernie Fitzgerald, the consummate Pentagon whistleblower of the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, once observed, every time the B-1 bomber has a cost overrun, the Soviet defense budget goes up! In other words, the more dollars we wasted, the more dangerous the other side became, which justified our wasting even more dollars, and so on.

Odd that the *Post* would publish the story on a Saturday--the lowest day of circulation for newspapers (there is no time stamp--not sure if this article ran in the Saturday or Sunday edition). 

But, coming on the backside of the CIA spying on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, the CIA lying about spying on the SSCI, the 6 year process of releasing the Torture Report--and, of course, the CIA destroying 90 videotapes of "interrogations"...You would think this story would have caused some shock waves in the media--but only one major media source has picked the story up: the Sydney Morning Herald (Australia). 

What the f#ck is going on here? The news is OUT--but the major media seem to be refusing to reprint or follow-up on the story...Did anyone even ask POTUS, the Pentagon or the CIA about the article on Monday?

	<TEXT> The whole things a JOKE: r/news and r/worldnews both pretty much turn off the counter for votes around the 5,000 mark...they both seem to manipulate the number of total votes according to their mods whims of what is "news"--an article which they favor will end up with a higher vote count...if the mods don't particularly like an article they will turn the vote count off early (and make it drop from the #1 position early). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> [WASHINGTON POST ARTICLE](http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/cia-photos-of-black-sites-could-complicate-guantanamo-trials/2015/06/27/7b1177bc-1912-11e5-93b7-5eddc056ad8a_story.html?tid=pm_world_pop_b)

Odd that the *Post* would publish the story on a Saturday--the lowest day of circulation for newspapers (there is no time stamp--not sure if this article ran in the Saturday or Sunday edition). 

But, coming on the backside of the CIA spying on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, the CIA lying about spying on the SSCI, the 5 year process of releasing the Torture Report--and, of course, the CIA destroying 90 videotapes of "interrogations"...You would think this story would have caused some shock waves in the media--but only one major media source has picked the story up: the Sydney Morning Herald (Australia). 

What the fuck is going on here? The news is OUT--but the major media seem to be refusing to reprint or follow-up on the story...Did anyone even ask the Pentagon or the CIA about the article? 

EDIT:  Just wrote a letter to the guardian...here's the US contact page:

	<TEXT> Wm. Casey was supposed to meet up with a commission looking into the records of JFK right before he died...the film states Casey spoke with Congress 32 times--way more than any previous director of CIA...

I linked an article which delves into Casey's death further--pretty good read...I stayed away from posting Casey's links to the Phoenix program in Vietnam (and other controversial aspects of his career).

It should also be noted who took Casey's place in the CIA: GHW Bush. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> it's actually easier to read that way...

As for the post...I started watching this doc from 1992 a few days ago [**THE PANAMA DECEPTION**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo6yVNWcGCo) which starts out by pointing out how slanted the US media was towards the US invasion of Panama...really shocking to see how brainwashed we are to have believed the US media for so long--"a free press"...i've come to realize maybe the media in Russia is less dangerous than the US media--at least the Russians question everything their spin machine churns out...while here in the US, most Americans just see a report on TV and accept the "official US version" of events (even when the lie is exposed a day or two later).

I assembled a few other facts--mostly about Pakistan, that I found interesting: 

---------

**STRANGE** that the CIA spent untold amounts on operations as well as untold amounts of cash bribing everyone they could in Afghanistan and Pakistan to find out where UBL was...then they finally get lucky--after spending BILLIONS--and have an informer  WALK-IN who worked for the Pakistani ISI come in and cough up UBL's location. 

**STRANGE** that the U.S. gave [Military Aid to Pakistan](http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/row/pakaid.pdf)--over $30 Billion since 9/11. 

**STRANGE** that [Porter Goss and Bob Graham](http://www.foreignpolicyjournal.com/2014/03/17/the-911-joint-congressional-inquiry-and-28-missing-pages/) were with the head of the Pakistan's ISI on 9/11 in Washington DC

**STRANGE** that the head of Pakistan's ISI quit about a week after 9/11 because a newspaper from India published an [article outing him as having sent the 9/11 hijackers money](http://www.propagandamatrix.com/india_helped_fbi_trace_isi_terrorist_links.htm)

...but most folks don't remember all that.
