	<TEXT> I'll actually put the first one ahead of dredd as the ultimate indicator of how stupid the average fanboy is.

When a film makes that shitty godzilla reboot look good you know you've done something wrong.

Weak ass premise. Shitty stock characters. Contrived love story (but not really, daddy issues). Awful dialogue. The acting was so fucking bad even the good actors were uncomfortable.

What a piece of shit.

And it somehow made enough to warrant another?

or something like that

but there is no one way

there is a writer/director on the front of reddit now who mentions some stuff

or go spend time on /r/screenwriting and read posts

but thinking it is just about writing a couple of scripts you think are good and just sending them to the head honchos and getting green lit is tremendously naive 

the fucking writing itself seems a fairly minor point overall
