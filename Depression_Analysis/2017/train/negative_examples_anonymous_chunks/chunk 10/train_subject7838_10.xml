	<TEXT> The track is 133.75 feet long and 6.1 feet high.  If a real roller coaster is about 100 feet high, then this roller coaster at 1/16 scale would be 2,192 feet long.  If it was 200 feet high, then at 1/33 scale it would be 4,458 feet long. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We bought 6 of the red track sets about four years ago, that's what you see in the gif.  I'm sure some people are selling individual parts online but I've never bought them like that.  The big sets are expensive but it's a very reusable toy. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's the whole point.  I think it is a good contrast to the all-out grittiness of 3. The environment appears a lot cleaner, brighter and safer, which provides a good contrast to the animatronics.   </TEXT>

	<TITLE> I dislike surprises, anyone else? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-07-13 06:03:46 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I don't like surprise parties whether it's for me or for someone else.  I enjoy mysteries, such as something unknown to me that will definitely happen on an expected date, but I don't think it's fun when others purposely hide something from you.

I also dislike when someone says "I have something to tell you!"  Again, this is witholding information when they could just tell you.  I always like to stay informed...

I'm all for the suprises and adventures of everyday life but I don't think it's enjoyable when someone is plotting something to surprise you with, especially if both the information and timing is unexpected and especially if they expect you to react in a certain way.

Maybe INTJs just like to be in control or aware of situations as much as possible. </TEXT>
