	<TEXT> We can't stop you from using our hotels for your "escort services" (seriously, what idiot is going to pay $250 for a 15 minute chat with a woman, unless there is sex involved), but don't post advertisements using our hotel rooms in the picture.

You're putting our logo out to the world, saying "come here and there are prostitutes", and that tarnishes our reputation.

And I'm not even gonna get into the **underage** prostitutes!

Show some god damned decorum, and at the very least take your photos in such a way that I can't tell it was my hotel by looking at it.

P.S. If I see **you** on Back Page, I may let you check in to the hotel, then tip off the police. Fair warning. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> So, they made a magical boys anime, seemingly a direct homage to Sailor Moon, and that got me thinking... </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-01-11 14:24:40 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> ... can they do a Magical Boys anime that isn't... girly?

I started doing a writeup of costuming and theme to make a more serious version, mixing elements of Sailor Moon with the live action Super Sentai.

I wrote out the whole thing, making suggestions along the way (I hadn't posted it, because I hadn't gotten the reference pictures for it), and realized that someone *had* already made a serious Magical Boys anime, that had certain parallels to Sailor Moon without being a parody of the genre...

Yoroiden Samurai Troopers, also known as Ronin Warriors, featured an all-male troop of young men who transformed into powerful ronin. The costuming was mostly angular (straight lines are more visually masculine compared to curves), had little frills or excess (especially in the sub-armor form).

Like Sailor Moon, they fought with their faces uncovered, but (as fitting for the more stoic men) focused less on battle speeches and more on weapons and attacks.

It was funny, I watched the whole series when it came out, and nearly forgot about it when it was most appropriate...

So, the real question is... can we do a show like this again? </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Yesterday, one of our regular, problem guests checks out of her room without saying anything. No big deal, happens all the time, but housekeeping needed my help getting inside the room.

On entering, I see ash from a cigarette on the nightstand next to the bed.

She comes back today (with the frequency that she does this, I'm sure she is a prostitute) looking for a room. I tell her flatly that she was smoking in the room before and because it was a nonsmoking room she would have to pay a cleaning fee.

 I didn't smoke in the room, though. I don't smoke cigarettes.  
 My friend might have done some marijuana...

I tell her that regardless of the kind of cigarette, there is no smoking allowed in the room, and she doubles down.

 My friend was probably just rolling a blunt...

I let the comment pass the first time, but I had to speak up.

 Don't tell me you're doing marijuana in the rooms, because that's illegal. If you want to stay, you will have to stay in a smoking room, and you'll have to pay a cleaning fee for smoking in our nonsmoking room.

 How much is that?

 $50 (our reg card says we can charge up to $250)

She left, and I doubt she'll return while I am working. (But, she'll probably try and see if the night guys go easy on her.) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sorry about the long one.

We had a power outage last night. Nothing major, just an idiot crashing into a pole.

Of course, everyone demands special treatment in the morning because of it. Most of the people were happy to get a $10 discount and be done with it, some didn't even ask for that much...

But there is always one.

He comes in around 10:30, and asks us to comp him the entire room for his stay. I tell him, "No. I can't do that. And with your room paid through a third party, I can not adjust your rate. But, if you stay over tonight and pay with me, I'll give the room for $69.95 ($15 off the current room rent)"

Well, that isn't good enough for them, because they use some weird referral system that pays out in room discounts, so they were getting the room for like $62.

So, they go off and decide to use that system to get the room again, asking for a little extra time to complete it. I tell them that I can give until 11:30, half an hour past checkout.

About 11:20 he comes back in and says that he forgot some paperwork in the room, and he'll need to get it to pay. At 11:45 he tells me that he needs until 12:30.

At 12:15, his wife/girlfriend/drug-addicted-crack-ho comes out, saying they need until 1... at this point, I tell her flat out, "we can not keep waiting like this. You need to take care of this right away."

"Okay, I know... But your Internet wasn't working right and you just need to give us more time! Oh, and can I get some fresh towels."

I reiterate that housekeeping is waiting on her to pay for the room, and that we will not provide housekeeping in any form until it is done.

1 PM rolls around... still no payment. I call her this time, and she tells me she needs another 15 minutes... That she is putting in the information right then, and it will be showing up on the computer any minute.

No such luck.

1:10 - I call her back, and she says that it is *literally* being processed and it will only be another 6 minutes.

Now, at this point, I'm tired of the excuses. I told her flat out that we need this done *now*, and if it doesn't happen, I'll be contacting the police to evict her.

Wouldn't you know it... nothing happens.

So, I call the police (non emergency) and have them send a uni. While waiting for that, the guest comes out "trying to get the room taken care of". Even though she already told me that it was being processed. Cops drive up, and she goes back to the room.

They talk a few minutes, and she gets them to admit that if I can be convinced to accept payment, she can stay, so she comes back to the desk.

I stick to my guns, but there is one factor I can't control.

My boss decided to walk out from the back. I kept him out of this for a reason. He has a pathological fear of confrontation with guests, and if you talk to him, you'll probably get your way. And sure enough... the guest waves cash at his face, even though it's 2 PM and the police are here to remove her, and he says just let her stay.

Every god damned time. Bring in a pet? He'll break his own posted rules to let you stay. Smoke in a nonsmoking room? Don't worry about it.

He's so interested in the online reviews that he would probably let someone rent a room with money that was stolen from him.

TL;dr guest refuses to pay until police are actually there to evict her 3 hours late, boss lets her stay anyway.  </TEXT>

They don't. They never come down. We call again, and go up to find that they simply took their time to leave and didn't bother saying anything after they told me they were going to stay.

I think the visual direction of the show is meant to mimic the personalities of the Doctor.

	<TEXT> I would like to use small videos for my store to give a simple demonstration of the cards in use, but I do not want a boring demo with two people playing the game.

If anyone can make a short, less than 1 minute scene with Jace directing his Tidal Warrior (or other blue creature less than 3/3) to attack Chandra, who blocks it with a Cinder Wall, and you would be willing to work on other short videos for the same purpose, please contact me.

Videos will be uploaded onto a YouTube channel and linked to my website at www.betonwhite.com, with links to your personal website or YouTube channel.

Edit: I forgot to spell out that I do intend to pay for the work performed, but would like to speak with the artist that volunteers for this chance before negotiating a price. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> We have a swim meet this weekend here in town, and of course that means that a number of teams are staying at the hotel. 

They *all* want to leave their stuff in the rooms, go to the meet in the morning, come back around 2, shower and get their stuff, and leave around 3 PM.

Naturally, with our checkout time at 11AM, I had to deny their requests.

At least one team just decided they were going to take it anyway. I might have to just charge them for tonight, a couple more want to complain to my boss, which won't do much good, though they will probably lie on me and say that I was incredibly rude (the standard when someone is told "no"), which my boss will believe and I'll get in trouble. 

But if I just let half a dozen rooms leave whenever they want, I'll get in trouble for that. </TEXT>

All this sounds like a sob story by a homeless guy to stay in the lobby, right?

Another guest comes in while he's there, asks about rates, etc, and when she leaves, he pops up with a rifle scope in his hands, saying "she wouldn't even know what hit her" and starts talking about his skills at killing people.

I'm wondering if I should put a tip into Mental Health once we have him in a room. </TEXT>

I'll be honest, I'm not exactly stoked to have to pay $15 to play Final Fantasy XIII again, when I own it for the PS3. I hope they would link PS Now to the SEN servers and let us play any digital downloads for free, as well as let us use the PS Now service to play games we have the disc for. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Lady came in with an Expedia reservation. I ask for her ID and credit card and she gives me the usual "They've already charged it." speech.

I remind her that we just need a valid card in case of incidental charges, and she asks if I'm going to run her card. Now, I don't normally run the cards, but 9 times out of 10 when they ask me that, they are giving me a bad one. So, I reiterate that the card just needs to be valid (basically, she just has to tell me it is, because we don't have a way of checking without charging).

So, she gets angry with me, and we finish the check-in, finally. I point out her room on the map, point out where she can park, direct her to the stairwell, and she leaves kind of hurried.

My manager, who was in the lobby to supervise the painters, asks me to go up to check on a room that had a problem reported, and as I am coming down the stairs, I end up meeting the family I just checked in.

 Where's the room, Mom?

 I don't know, that asshole didn't tell me.

She sees me up the stairs, looking at her.

 Yeah, I called you an asshole!

I say nothing and finish walking down the stairs, and I see them starting to pass the stairs to go into the first floor hallway. I step back closer to the wall and point up the stairs,

 Your room is up this way, ma'am.

 It's upstairs? Don't you have an elevator?

 No, I'm sorry.

She rushes past me, moving up the stairs with her 7 and 12 year old children.

 Stupid asshole...

 Ma'am, if you are not happy here, you can stay somewhere else...

I turned my back to her.

 And that's great parenting, by the way. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The mattresses, the nightstand, the microwave, the couch. They left the TVs only because they were bolted down.

I called the police and they tried to force me into a telephone report, instead of sending an officer as I requested.

Edit with updates - We found which guest had done this, they were checked into the room right next to the original crime scene.

After coaxing the police to come in, they said that they wouldn't be able to process the room for fingerprints or other evidence. They gave their case numbers and went to the car to file the report. 

Housekeeping calls me almost immediately to let me know that the neighboring room was having trouble with the lock, and that they had seen guests climbing in and out through the window. I open the door and find the room in worse shape than the first.

The light fixtures had been torn from the bathroom, the bed was simply gone, the television was on the ground and the dresser it had been bolted to was missing, the couch and recliners were gone, the second bed was wrecked, and naturally they took the mini fridge and microwave.

So I got the attention of the cop again, and now we have a crime scene tech going over the rooms. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is a warning for customers and businesses. I apologize if this isn't the best location for this.

Apparently, scam artists have found a way to tap into 800 numbers while they are queuing for an operator. When the call is redirected, a foreign operator will apologize for the long hold time and offer a gift card or other compensation, and ask for a credit card for processing fees.

Obviously, you should never give out credit card information for unsolicited items, nor should you ever give credit card information in order to get money from a company.

If you fall prey to this scam, make sure you advise the company that there may be unknown recurring charges, and treat your credit/debit card as stolen. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I work at a sunny motel, all but managing the breakfast area in addition to front desk, and recently Corporate made the unilateral decision to change all of the breakfast items to be "healthy".

They took out a lot of the sweet items, like danishes, and replaced them with better choices, like cinnamon raisin bread.

The problem was, our location had previously had the best breakfast we could manage for our class of hotel.

The changes meant that instead of hand-cooked scrambled eggs and sausage, we had to make precooked omelets with 'cheese'. Our breads were almost all replaced by the cinnamon bread. We had to stop giving out oatmeal in the instant packets, and had to cook oatmeal in a kettle daily.

Needless to say, our guests are not happy. The omelets taste horrible and take forever to heat up. The oatmeal takes an hour to be ready to eat. We have a much lower variety of food, thanks to getting rid of most of our breads.

I was planning on calling to the GM hotline to give them a piece of my mind...

When the breakfast director called me, asking how the new breakfast was working out. And I told her the truth. It stinks.

We at the hotel hate it, because of the time it takes to prepare. The guests hate it because they were used to a wider variety from us.

I told her that we need a waiver to allow us to go back to the sausage and eggs and to put out the instant oatmeal again.

I also told her that we need to be given discretion on extra items, not on the list.

Even though I was polite and conversational, she still meekly stated that she will talk to someone higher up to make the changes I suggested.  

I think we're going to have our good breakfast back. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [The Big Bang Theory] How to give the show an awesome sendoff. </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I don't know if this will happen, but this would be the best end that I can think of. The show has been signed for another three years, and this will assume it ends at that timeframe.

Over the course of the show, Penny has shown herself to be more and more interested in nerd culture and science thanks to Leonard and the gang. During the next two seasons, this interest can blossom into a full passion, leading to the second year finale, where she asks Leonard and Sheldon to help her start a show to make science more interesting to normal children, like Bill Nye or Professor Proton.

The third, and final, season of the show has her working with everyone to make the show-within-a-show, with her as the host and relating scientific concepts in a friendly manner, scripted by Bernadette and Raj.

The penultimate episode ends with Penny getting a call from Dr. Gablehauser, offering her an honorary doctorate for her work. In the last episode, Howard acts all steamed for a bit before getting over the fact that Penny gets to be called Doctor before he does. This also serves as a way of finally revealing her last name, which was carefully guarded over the series run. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Much shorter than my last rants.

Indian student comes into the lobby, asks if we are hiring and who the manager is. I offered my Indian boss's pseudonym "Bill" and proceed to hand him an application, like I do for any other person looking for a job.

 Do I have to fill out the application? I want a job under the table.

I look to him with a straight face, then to the line of customers behind him, and tell him that he does, and that it is illegal to be paid under the table for work. (I don't normally go that far, but I didn't want the guests to have the impression that we hire like that, even though my stupid boss does)

He persists for a minute, and ultimately leaves without filling out the application at all.

Guest walks up to the counter with a laugh, and I tell him the funniest part. If Bill wanted to hire him under the table after he filled out an application,  he could simply throw it away afterwards.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's Spring Break here, in a coastal town, to give you the background on this reservation.

Semi - regular guest comes in at 8, 9 in the morning and asks for a room right away. I explain to him that the room is not ready yet, as we had a full house, but I get him reserved for the night so he doesn't have to worry. 

He calls over and over again throughout the morning, asking for the room to be ready, parking in the back and bugging the different housekeepers, and generally being impatient. I tell him specifically not to bother housekeeping while he is waiting for his room.

2 o'clock rolls around, and he comes up to the desk again. I tell him that they haven't let me know yet, and that if I didn't know by the time my relief arrived at 3, I would find out for him.

He says okay, and walks off toward the back, then goes to one of the housekeepers and convinces him to let them into a room (that wasn't even the room assigned to him), saying that I told him it was okay.

I wouldn't even have known about it if the housekeeper hadn't thought to tell me after. I told them to leave. Period. We are busy enough that we will rerent the room, no problem. 

Turns out the housekeepers know that he was dealing drugs from the room during previous stays.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Simple story, constantly repeated in any hotel setting.

Guest makes their reservation through ThatOneInternetSiteWeKnow.com (fake name if that is actually a domain out there) and gets the room to arrive on Friday. She calls me afterwards to make sure everything is good.

Friday comes around and she calls back, saying that she will be coming later than expected. Again, no big deal. I note that she will arrive late.

By the night audit, she still hadn't shown up, but I left the note, so the NA checked the room in.

Guest arrives at 3PM, Saturday, and asks for her reservation. The poor Indian student (I was off) at the desk is temporarily confused by the missing reservation, as it was no longer reserved. It was In House.

Guest calls TOISWK, who calls the desk and assists him in finding the room. Problem solved, right? 

Wrong. 

She comes in this morning,  Monday, to make sure she was credited for the stay Friday night, saying that the person who had trouble finding her room told her she'd be refunded.

So, I told her calmly, carefully, that we can not credit her back for any reason on a third-party booking, as we did not charge her. I also explained to her that despite any difficulty in finding the reservation, it was in the computer the whole night and that the room was not rerented in any way. But i told her that if she wishes to dispute the charges, she must do so with TOISWK. 

She calls them, who calls me asking to refund, and I reiterate that we will not refund. The room was in house on Friday and was held for her to check in at any time. We also would have had to turn guests away, as it is Spring Break (not that you can tell from the weather).

Guest comes back to the lobby, TOISWK on the phone in her ear, and demands that I grant permission.

Now, at this point, I am stonewalling. I apologized for any mistakes or misinformation that may have been given, but I would not give in and remove the night's charge. I also refused to call the manager out from the more important things he was doing, as I know he doesn't like dealing with people. 

After the guest leaves in a huff to call corporate to try and get a refund, I bring the information to the manager so he knows what is going on.

Lo and behold, he was *there* when the FD looked for the reservation and he most definitely did not offer any sort of credit or refund. He told me that if she came back, he would talk to her, but she simply left the building. 

TL;dr Entitled self - important guest thinks she can dictate our refund policies. </TEXT>

I am also looking into a distributor for the Enterplay trading card series and the MLP CCG. I'll send more word when they are available.

Edit - I am getting a hoof full of 1 and 2 player starter boxes from my distributors. I'll set up pre orders for them shortly, so I can start shipping out as soon as they arrive.

 Marketing Requirements

 WeiB Schwarz is to be written with either a capital B or the german
character equivalent. Note that "Weiss", while a popular transliteration,
is incorrect, and should not have top billing. ("WeiB Schwarz / Weiss
Schwarz" is okay, simply "Weiss Schwarz" is not). This is a high-priority request from Bushiroad themselves. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Lady comes into the office, kids in tow, her husband starts making a baby bottle on my counter, and she interrupts my interaction with the person in front of her.

I make her wait the half a minute it takes to tell my guest where to go, and get her information and she decides to take a room. So far, so good, though she told me that she was going to be the only adult, when I see her husband right there. The kids aren't old enough, so it doesn't change the rate anyway.

She pulls out an absolutely mangled ID. It's been cut into pieces and taped back together, with the ID number, name, and photo on three different pieces. Huge red flags in my head already, with her trying to rush me and then the questionable ID. And then I see my out.

The piece that has the ID number also has an expiration date of two weeks ago. I told her I couldn't rent to her with an invalid ID.

Edit: Part 2!

She comes back in, her children in tow, and brings along someone else with a valid ID. We start getting her signed in and I ask for payment, and get the response, "Oh! She didn't pay you yet?"

Nope. She didn't. I give them the price and they make a huge deal getting out the money, hand me the money, then change their mind about staying.

I didn't even have to be an asshole that time,  and they left. 

My guess is that they were hoping I'd have forgotten about the fact that I didn't charge them for not taking the room.  </TEXT>
