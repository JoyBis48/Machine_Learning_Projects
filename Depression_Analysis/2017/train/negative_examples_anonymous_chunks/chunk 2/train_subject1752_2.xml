	<TEXT> While all developing countries  from the least developed to middle-income  can celebrate accomplishments in their progress towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), critical gaps remain. Despite vast diversities, African, Least Developed, Landlocked, Small Island and Middle-Income Countries share, to varying degrees, many common challenges on their path to equitable sustainable development. These include: poverty, growing inequality, hunger, food insecurity, improving public health and education, providing social protection, youth unemployment, migration, urbanization, changing age structures, growing pressures on resources, and climate change. Some countries also face conflict situations or post-conflict fragilities. In many, the globalization of inequality and social exclusion is leading to increased social unrest and dissatisfaction with current models and trends of development. In various cases, these challenges are aggravated and perpetuated by weaknesses in democratic governance and institutional capacity, weak infrastructure, debt burdens, economic crisis, corruption, funding shortfalls, and declines in development cooperation.

This brief focuses on three key pillars for achieving social, economic and environmentally sustainable development:

Advancing the human rights of women and girls and gender equality;
The rights and empowerment of adolescents and youth;
Sexual and reproductive health and rights for all.
These are essential, cross-cutting foundations for a post-2015 people-centred and planet-sensitive development agenda. They are mutually-reinforcing prerequisites for progress, relevant for all countries regardless of their stage of development. They are also smart, effective and cost-saving investments with multiple payoffs across a range of development objectives.

A human rights-based and holistic approach to sustainable development must address multiple dimensions of discrimination and exclusion, including for women and young people as the two largest demographic groups in the world facing inequality and insecurity. Sexual and reproductive health problems  which are preventable  take a huge toll on lives, families, productivity, economies and public budgets. They entrench poverty and erode development prospects, and represent costs and burdens that can and must be lifted. The limited investments in these key areas is a major reason why many of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) have not been achievedan important lesson for crafting the post-2015 agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The observed descent time of the upper 18 stories of the north face of WTC 7 (the floors clearly visible in the video evidence) was 40 percent greater than the computed free fall time. A more detailed analysis of the descent of the north face found three stages: (1) a slow descent with acceleration less than that of gravity that corresponded to the buckling of the exterior columns at the lower floors, (2) a freefall descent over approximately eight stories at gravitational acceleration for approximately 2.25 s, and (3) a decreasing acceleration as the north face encountered resistance from the structure below.

	<TEXT> Even though the lower undamaged structure was designed to be able to handle the upper damaged 18 stories, this is only true in a static sense. Once the loads became dynamic (due to gravity), the dynamic loads had already far exceeded the structural design limit and the failure had to propagate until all the energy is dissipated.

This is true for nearly every structure in existence, and certainly true for every skyscraper: once progressive collapse begins, it can't be stopped because the supporting structure below cannot handle the many multiplications of the load it was designed to support.
