	<TEXT> I often feel a lot of resentment to my past self. 

I like to think that it's because I'm becoming a better person every day (that is, moving ever closer to being the person I truly want to be).

Then I realise it's because I used to be a little twat.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This has scared me many a time. Lets say that at the time of the Big Bang, there was this 'point' that contained everything in the Universe. And one day it explode and expanded and here we are. BUT, where was this point? How did all that matter come about? Where did it come from? 

What I mean is, what was there before? If there was nothing, then how did it become something? Where did all these atoms come from? Where is the beginning of the story? 

That's the best way to explain my thoughts when I think about the creation of the Universe. I've just shit my pants.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My friend pulled down his jeans and boxers and farted in his girlfriend's face at her birthday party. She instantly gagged and threw her glass of wine in his face. We both collapsed with laughter, crying our eyes out and rolling around on the floor, hugging like little giggling babies. 

Still to this day I'll think about it and laugh out loud. I always tell this story whenever people ask me why I just laughed for no reason. 

Best memory ever. She was a bitch.  </TEXT>

Danielle is very sensible. 

Jerry, I can't believe I didn't think of that myself.
