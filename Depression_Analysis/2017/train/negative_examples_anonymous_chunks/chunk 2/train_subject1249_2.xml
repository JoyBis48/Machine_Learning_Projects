	<TEXT> If you look at the UK Royal Mail and Canada Post, there is a huge privatization scheme in both countries.  However, the privatization schemes are the direct results when you get conservatives to rule.  

The people who live in rural areas have to most lose if the post office get privatized because the corporations will significantly increase the price of rural deliveries.  And I read somewhere that UPS and Fed Ex rely on the postal service to deliver in some remote rural areas because it is out of UPS and Fed-Ex's area of service.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think the article is bit misleading because a lot of people that I know have not replaced watching TV for different hobbies.  I think people have switched to watching videos online as part of Netflix, Hulu Plus, and Bitorrent (which is illegal).  Also, people use DVRs now and watch TV at later dates.  The Nielsen ratings do not capture these statistics and therefore, they are understating how many people are actually watching broadcast or cable TV. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I do not like all of the social conservative talk.  I personally favor same-sex marriage and I hate all of the "family value" when it comes to homophobia especially when same sex couples are trying to form family units that the social conservatives value.

I can totally understanding when it comes to abortion when abortion is considered to be "abortion of convenience" and there is real no health justification for it.  I am beginning to oppose abortion in all cases where it is considered to be a "abortion of convenience" instead of health reasons or the women has drastic circumstances that make her to get an abortion. I am pro-choice but only for health cases or the mother is dire circumstances where having a child is not considered to be a feasible option. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The reality is that market does not "self-correct". It takes both investment from both the government and private sector to grow business.  

How is the private sector supposed to "self-correct" a horrendous labor participation rate?  If the market was to "self-correct" the labor participation rate, we would still see significant downward pressure on wages which would lead to greater inequity in the economy.  Greater inequity in the economy eventually leads to reduced consumer spending .  It is all a vicious cycle that will not end until we do something about income inequality.  Until the government changes the tax laws to incentivize companies from stopping hoarding cash, you are not going to see any future investment  </TEXT>

I think one of the major issues that should have been brought up at sentences was whether there was attempts to get her into a treatment program. If the evidence shows that nobody personally intervened to get her into treatment, this would be a major migitation factor. Once an alcoholic has been offered the opportunity to get treatment, the responsibility is on them to get treatment. It is also their job to remain sober. However, untreated alcoholism without the chance of treatment to me is a considered to be a major migitating circumstance on a criminal case </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I hope she wins, but it is long shot.  It depends how much of the vote that she can get from the Latino, African-American votes, and young, white voters.  If these groups turn out in high numbers despite Texas voter ID laws, she has a possible shot of winning. She needs to focus on these groups than trying to win the middle-class and upper-class white votes.  In Texas, winning a majority of white vote for a Dem is  just not to going to happen for a long, long time. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Look I am white guy that has lived or goes through Santa Ana almost every day. I shop at the local Walmart over Harbor and McFadden.  I use to live off Euclid and First and go downtown all the time.

Never once I was threated.  Sure, my phone was stolen when I left it on the bus, however, that would be expected in any major urban portion of the OC where people are struggling.

Personally, I believe that most of the danger is largely dependent on who associate with Santa Ana.  If you associate or family with gang-bangers or drug-users, you should expect your fair share of violence.  However, it is my  experience that there is little violence as long you do not associate with gangbangers. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think that Obama is getting a lot of pressure from the neo-conservative camp to do something on Syria and he wants to follow Clinton's footsteps in terms of limited intervention in foreign entanglements where whole-scale massacres of innocent people.  However, the Iraq War has permanently discredited the US use of force in foreign entanglements even the if the use of force was limited.  If Obama wanted to truly intervene the proper way, he should have gave arms to rebels a long time ago and sent special forces as advisors for training the rebels. I think that is better use of military resources than limited strikes that could potential escalate the war. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Personally, I knew people who in my social network who spew anti-Obama stuff, but I personally are wonderful and very nice people.  A lot of Christians that I know are very spiritual and really love God with all of their hearts.

I think that the media poisons the debate and makes charactures out of both liberals and conservatives.  Unless you know people personally really well that hold those views, sometimes the sterotype persists especially when you spend all of our time hanging out with one type of people.

People follow the echo chamber so much (including myself) and do not realize that reality is far different than the echo chamber that exists on the left.  Not all of right-wing and left-wing talk hosts reflect the craziness.  There is a lot of thoughtful conservative talk radio hosts (like Michael Medev) or Thom Hartmann who is a liberal talk show host.  I think Rachel Maddow and Chris Hayes are very thoughful people as well. 

Not everybody that you hear on the radio is bombastic, but the people are the bombastic tend to drive the highest ratings and advertising dollars.  The funny is that the most crazy guy on the left, Mike Malloy, gets rejected even though Mike Malloy is often right.

	<TEXT> If I were a judge, I would throw out the case and state it was excessive sentencing because the offender did not engage in the production of child porn.  Since the counts only involved the viewing of child pornography without any prior offenses, the sentence is unjustfied and the person needs to be sentenced to a term of years not to exceed 20 years and subject to lifetime supervision as a sex offender. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If the victims want truth-in-sentencing, develop a state sentencing commission and then create significantly lower sentences for all crimes except for child rape, aggravated forcible rape, and first-degree murder.  Offenders would only get 15%-25% off their sentences and  victims would know exactly how long the offender is serving in prison without seeing a huge increase in overcrowding because stiff sentencing requirements.  In addition, people that commit serious violent habitual felonies more than two times are locked on life sentence without parole subject to governor's ability to commute the sentence to a terms of years if the prisoner shows extraordinary merit and rehabilitation of mind,body, and soul </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There is needs to be a state-wide law prohibiting cities from shutting down dispensaries.  Until the state creates mandatory requirements from each city in terms of regulating dispensaries, this issue will keeping going on.  It comes to unfounded fear about crime and illegal activity.  Cops should stop raiding marijuana facilties and instead of spending time trying to bust people who drive stoned.  The fact is that you should right to smoke unless you get behind a wheel and cause an accident.  Driving while impaired is far bigger problem than people just trying to smoke to relieve some tension or pain in their body. </TEXT>
