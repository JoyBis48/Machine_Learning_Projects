So they may not feel pain, but they can cause some serious pain. Researchers discovered that after having the lobsters larger claw, the crusher claw, clamp down on a load cell, a pressure-measuring device.

On June 6, 1991, plaintiff sued defendant, a brewer and seller of beer and malt liquor, claiming that defendant had violated the provisions of the PAA by placing before the public advertisements for its products that contain "statements and/or representations which are untrue, deceptive and/or misleading." As a result, plaintiff claimed, he and the general public had been led to consume defendant's products, which defendant knew were dangerous and likely to cause serious health problems, including addiction and death. In support of his claims, plaintiff pointed to defendant's television advertisements featuring Bud Light as the source of fantasies coming to life, fantasies involving tropical settings, and beautiful women and men engaged in unrestricted merriment. Plaintiff sought monetary damages in excess of $10,000, alleging that defendant's misleading advertisements had caused him physical and mental injury, emotional distress, and financial loss.
Defendant moved for summary disposition, arguing among other things that it had no duty to warn of commonly known dangers. The trial court agreed with defendant's analysis in this regard, and granted summary disposition in its favor. We agree and affirm.

 Last July  I read a story about an 8-year-old girl, Abby Enck, who, in the most genuine of ways, came up with a plan to share her love of coloring. I encourage you to read more about Abby in the link provided, but in a nutshell  shes one of the most inspirational people I have come across. Abbys younger brother Cameron was born with Cerebral Palsy and she would regularly accompany him to Lutheran General Hospital on his medical visits. Abby noticed that the other pediatric patients liked to color, but many of the crayons were broken. Abby had purchased some crayons with her parents for the patients, but it didnt end there. For Abby, it was the obvious thing to do  think up a way to raise money so that she can buy crayons and other coloring materials for the patients.
Abby conducted a lemonade sale. Soon the 8-year-old came up with a plan to raise money by creating lemonade kits using bottled water with attached packets and tags with her very own message, When life gives you lemons, color!. She gained the help of family and friends and before she knew it she was on her way to a goal of purchasing 1000 boxes for the children at the hospital.

The precursor to Kool-Aid Man, the Pitcher Man, was created in 1954 by Marvin Potts, an art director for a New York advertising agency hired by General Foods to create an image that would accompany the slogan "A 5-cent package makes two quarts." Inspired by watching his young son draw smiley faces on a frosted window, Potts created the Pitcher Man, a glass pitcher with a wide smile emblazoned on its side and filled with Kool-Aid. It was one of several designs Potts created but the only one that stuck, and General Foods began to use the Pitcher Man in all of its advertisements. </TEXT>

It's one of the most common go-to reasons police use for a bullshit stop to provide reasonable suspicion. 

Source?

considering how often police have been proven to lie lately

You need to step away from the media machine.  Take into consideration the number of police officers there are in this country, the number of interactions each may have every single day, and then compare to the number of instances that actually get blown up.

That is not a reasonable attitude.

Sure it is.  Why?  Because there is nothing there to cause me to doubt it.  What exactly is there about this instance that makes you question the reliability?  Have you wondered at all about the man that was stopped at all and what he was/may have been doing or is the fact that he's not the police officer enough for you to not question his motives?

	<TEXT> Apply that logic to income inequality.

Because that's an entirely different subject.

The wage gap continues to grow and the lower classes do not resort to violence. But because they don't take drastic actions, they don't get results.

Occupy Wall Street certainly didn't do anything.

That's his point, America praises the Boston Tea Party in which America finally revolted and took charge. America fought a violent war to get change from Britain.

The patriots fought for independence, to become their own country.  What exactly are the riots doing and how is it going to change things?

Strictly non-violence is exactly what your opposers want you to use because it doesn't insight enough fear in them

Yet show your full hand right off the bat and it's not going to instill fear either.  Additionally, things like this have been played out before.  Someone fucks up, huge uproar, riots, riots, more riots but not as bad, less riots, and then eventually people go home and do whatever it is they do.   </TEXT>

And until anything else comes out this is all we have to go on.  I mean, that's how things roll right?  When a police officer is accused of doing something wrong then in the eyes of the public they are guilty.  Shouldn't it be the same the other way around?

The 2009 Pittsburgh police shootings was a shootout that took place on Saturday, April 4, 2009, at 1016 Fairfield Street[1] in the Stanton Heights neighborhood of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States, stemming from a mother and her 22-year-old son's argument over a dog urinating in the house.[2] At approximately 7:11 a.m. EDT, 22-year-old Richard Poplawski opened fire on two Pittsburgh Police officers responding to a 9-1-1 call from Poplawski's mother, who was attempting to get the police officers to remove her son from the home. Three police officers were ultimately confirmed dead, and another two were seriously injured.

According to Pittsburgh Police Chief, Nathan Harper, Poplawski was armed with a semi-automatic AK-47-style rifle, a shotgun and three handguns (a .357 Magnum revolver, a .380-caliber handgun and a .45-caliber handgun), protected by a bulletproof vest, and had been lying in wait for the officers. According to police and witnesses, he held police at bay for four hours as the fallen officers were left bleeding nearby, their colleagues unable to reach them. More than 600 rounds were fired by the SWAT teams and Poplawski.

The victims were the first Pittsburgh city officers killed in the line of duty in 18 years. The incident was the second-deadliest attack on U.S. law enforcement since the September 11 attacks, following a shooting two weeks earlier in Oakland, California.
On June 28, 2011, Poplawski was sentenced to death by lethal injection on three counts of murder in the first degree.

	<TEXT> So about those week long peaceful protets that were happening and noone paid any attention or could of gave a fuck. What did those do?

Well, you have [this](http://blackwestchester.com/2015/04/27/10000-peacefully-protest-bmore/):

*What they dont report was there were, Muslims, Christians, Jews, Blacks, Whites, Asians, Young and Old, Rich and Poor people all united and standing harmoniously against common oppression, shared one of the organizers Frank Sha Francois. The demonstration was sponsored by a wide coalition of social justice groups, including Malik Shabazz of Black Lawyers For Justice (BLFJ), Carl Dix of Stop Mass Incarceration (SMIN) and brother Ted Freedomfighter Sutton of Sutton House, just to name a few who came in support of their brothers and sisters in Baltimore. Support for justice of Freddie Gray, 25, who was arrested one week ago, in West Baltimore. Who died on April 19th, from injuries sustained while he was in police custody.*

Here's what that does.  It shows a united front of all different types of people.  It shows that people want something done and they are willing to be civilized human beings, sit and discuss the problem, figure out a solution, and fix the problem.


The police are not innocent people

Pretty broad brush stroke there no?  Are there bad cops?  Absolutely.  Are they in the minority.  Yep.  If we want to paint broad brush strokes, would you then agree that "black people are criminals" based on a small percentage that are acting out violently and criminally?

they need to be brought to justice and held accountable

The ones that abuse their power?  Absolutely.

it will not happen thru peaceful means.

Yet it's been proven time and time again that it does.  What do violent/criminal acts do?  They give the city a reason to increase the number of police officers on the street and hire more.  It creates and/or strengthens a stereotype that then turns into bias/profiling.

HAHAH fuck off with the mlk thing

Yeah, because that would go against your agenda and proves you wrong.

 like things havent changed since 9/11 that make peaceful resistance useless

You're right.  Things have changed.  Such as, this country is far less racially divided than it was during the time of MLK.  **HE** was able to bring change, peacefully, in a far more hostile environment.  The environment is nowhere near as hostile today, yet people cannot impact change peacefully?  This just sounds like sheer laziness.

Boohoo other people lives are being disrupted while others fight for their fucking lives

If that's the attitude you want to give, then expect the same attitude in return.  

It's time to stop using the race card and playing victim.  People want to blame others for their situation instead of pulling their own shit together and taking personal responsibility.  You don't want the cops bothering you?  Then don't give them a reason too.  You want to succeed in life?  Then work for it.  Harming other people's lives, ruining their livelihood, creating destruction, and not acting like a civilized human being has never caused progress. </TEXT>

Liu Kang was originally going to be a Japanese character called Minamoto Yoshitsune, but Mortal Kombat co-creator and character designer John Tobias stated that the staff could not "deal with the name." According to Tobias, Liu Kang "was originally going to be a traditional monk  bald and in robes  but he wound up resembling Bruce Lee." As stated on his Mortal Kombat: Armageddon bio card, Ed Boon mentioned that Liu Kang was designed to be the most easily "accessible" character, meaning that both casual and experienced gamers could play as him with little difficulty. According to Tobias, Liu Kang was purposely the only character that voiced his finishing move in the original game, and was "the best" in the first sequel. Liu Kang was the only character in the first game whose finishing move (Fatality) did not explicitly murder his opponent, and also without the background dimming. This was because Liu Kang was depicted therein as a Shaolin monk, who in general have strict beliefs regarding killing and murder. However, starting with Mortal Kombat II, he was given gory Fatalities as he was thereafter depicted as a renegade monk who decided to grow his hair back, and who had "strong Shaolin beliefs, but was no longer a part of the Shaolin monks." In response to rumors that Liu Kang would die in Mortal Kombat II and therefore not make it into Mortal Kombat 3, Boon said, "It'd be like doing part three of Star Wars and not having Luke Skywalker in there. You don't do that." His eventual death caused Dan Forden, the music composer of the series, to make a "funeral song" for Liu Kang as he felt saddened for his death. The track titled "Liu Kang's Tomb" would be used in Mortal Kombat: Deception in the arena that shows his tomb. </TEXT>

After practice, in the locker room, he was told there was a high possibility
he could be a bone marrow match for a complete stranger. Of the 12,000 blood
cancer patients who require marrow, 70 percent do not have matches in their
families.
When I got the phone call, I was so shocked, said Lyle. I totally forgot I
even signed up a couple of years before. Even then, I did not think I would be
a match. The odds are so ridiculous.
After additional testing, Lyle was confirmed as a definite match. There was
no time to waste. The surgery was scheduled immediately for April 25. There
was one catch: the surgery would take place one month before the end of his
college career.
Lyle never feared the actual marrow donation surgery. He worried the most
about telling his coach that he would be sitting out the final part of his
senior season because of the surgery. His coach, though, was supportive. Jim
Boulanger, director of New Hampshires track and field program, told Lyle that
sports do not triumph life, they are merely a part of it. If you have the
chance to save a life, do whatever it takes.
If Lyle chose to be a donor, his collegiate career would stop cold turkey
without the closure a championship win would bring him. As he threw his last
shot at the Stony Brook Invitational on April 20, his teammates surrounded him
to help bring one chapter of his life to a close. For him this was closure.
Hugs were shared and although it was not the ending he planned for, he was
allowing a stranger the chance to start a new chapter of his own.
Even with that elusive conference championship within reach, Lyle never had
any second thoughts about donating  especially when he learned about the man
who would be receiving his marrow donation.
Lyles 28-year-old match was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia a
few days before Christmas in 2012. He had a fianc and a nineteen-month-old
son. For Lyle, this information solidified his decision to donate.
I would have done it anyway, said Lyle. But knowing he is just starting
his life, he has so much ahead of him, makes it worth it. It hits home because
he is only a few years older than I am.

Art recalls, "It was a God awful accident and it was not very probable that someone would come through something like that - they figured. And, Yeah, I was reported being dead by one of the radio stations."
Art's left arm was severely bleeding from what appeared to be surface wounds. The doctors pulled out close to 50 pieces of glass embedded into his skin on his left arm, he said.
He also had four to five broken ribs and his hip severely broken in several places. Art spent eight weeks in a body cast and had a tracheotomy to help him breathe easier.
Because all of the blood was assumed to be from glass cuts and the hip injury was so severe, doctors failed to notice a metal rod  the T-bird's turn signal arm  was embedded in Art's left forearm.
Art and Betty met six months later on a blind date.
Let's fast forward to 15 years ago when Art discovered there was something in his arm because of a metal detector at the courthouse in Jerseyville, Ill.
His doctor checked it out and thought it was from the accident, but no telling exactly what it was.
In fact, the doctor thought it could have been a surgical instrument forgotten and sewed up inside his arm. But, because it didn't bother Art, the doctor said to leave it alone.
In early December, the arm started to pose a problem after Art carried a cement block. After feeling a little pain, days later he started to notice a protrusion. Art was referred to a specialist.
Doctor Lang removed the seven-inch rod on Dec. 31. The procedure lasted 45 minutes.

At this point it's very apparent that you're just a troll as you seemingly mock the issue of PTSD.  So with that, carry on with your internet bad self and [have a good day](http://i.giphy.com/fAGln5qp01U9q.gif). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> According to the [U.S. Census](http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/31/3103950.html), Bellevue's veteran population makes up 13.6% of the cities population which is actually a fairly significant amount compared to most of the country.  How many have PTSD?  I doubt that an accurate statistic would be found online.

I seriously question if you were even actually in the military at all.  It's real easy to say things on the internet that aren't true to play into your agenda and, you seem to have a large lack of knowledge on the subject of PTSD.  Situations like [this](http://www.sacbee.com/news/local/health-and-medicine/article2602806.html) are the reason for these things. </TEXT>

jury needed less than 10 minutes to declare him guilty

It took less than a day for a jury to convict George Stinney Jr. and send him to the electric chair

It was a jury of 12 white men

"He was convicted of the deaths of 11-year-old Betty June Binnicker and 7-year-old Mary Emma Thames in deeply segregated Alcolu, S.C."

	<TEXT> Huh, same with [Ted Bundy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Bundy#Childhood).  Though I don't know what age he found out.

For the first three years of his life Bundy lived in the Philadelphia home of his maternal grandparents, Samuel and Eleanor Cowell, who raised him as their son to avoid the social stigma that accompanied birth outside wedlock at the time. Family, friends, and even young Ted were told that his grandparents were his parents and that his mother was his older sister. Eventually he discovered the truth; he told his girlfriend that a cousin showed him a copy of his birth certificate after calling him a "bastard", but he told biographers Stephen Michaud and Hugh Aynesworth that he found the certificate himself. </TEXT>
