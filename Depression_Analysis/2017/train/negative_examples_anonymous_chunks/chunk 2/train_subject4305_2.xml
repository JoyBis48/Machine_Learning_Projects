	<TEXT> I had this problem for almost all my life, it just so happens that all my life I was overweight. Once I lost weight it went away slightly but what really did the trick was building my chest. Bench, flys, more bench, dumbbell incline. But also working the upper back will help even it all out. Kiss your puffy cone nips goodbye! </TEXT>
