	<TEXT> I guess it depends on where you live. Pretty much all of the schools near me have drug/bullying problems, nothing major but enough to garner attention. The short time I did go to a "real" school wasn't bad at all though. In fact I rather enjoyed the whole experience! All my friends who were home-schooled and went to school are very happy. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When I was younger my parents had a lot of input about what I was doing for school work. These past couple of years I've been overseeing myself mostly. No tutors per say, but my mom knows a lot of teachers and she sometimes gets them to do something like, a weekly math class for a month or so. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Worth it? Just from interacting with teens your own age everyday? It's cool that you stayed home-schooled for so long, a couple of my friends decided to go to school a little younger than that. Most of them went to school at around 11 or 12 years old </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Me, in an orange t-shirt and brown shorts playing tag with my cousins. I remember this because it was *the moment* I realized I existed. I know it sounds weird, but at that moment I stopped playing for a second and thought: "I'm here"

I then went on to win that game of tag. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The fact that no one knows if there's an afterlife of any kind. Thinking about this used to REALLY freak me out when I was younger, I mean full on panic attacks. It still makes me sick to my stomach when I think about it now.

We don't know and we'll never know what happens to our souls/thoughts when we die. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Finally! Me and my cousin have been making weird and wonderful flavor combos for ages. We've tried at least 2 dozen different things. Some of our favorites include  


  Potato chips + Cake frosting  
Jell-O + Mashed potatoes   
Asparagus + Raspberry jelly  
Bananas + Maple syrup  
Tomatoes + Baked Beans  

And cinnamon, lots and lots of cinnamon. We put that on almost everything: Pizza, salad, eggs, soup, sandwiches, hamburgers and even on fruit!
