Also, in the early 80's my family had a grocery store. I started noticing red   blue flakes on my Nacho cheese Doritos. I asked my Frito Lay rep   he didn't know. Then a couple months later, he brought in a new Dorito with the red   blue flakes (Cool Ranch Doritos)... They were putting the Cool Ranch flavor to get people used to the flavor.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Traffic is terrible. Quite possibly the worst complaint about the city. There's over a hundred people moving here a day. I'm sure there's other tax revenues that can pay for roads.

Toll roads are barely used. I won't use them, it's a luxury tax. I'm not convinced the $.25/mile (whatever the rate) they're receiving is more than the cost of people's lives being wasted in gridlock. 

How much does the TxTag system cost to operate vs it's revenue? In 2012, MnPass (Minnesota's version) cost $2.4 million to operate and only earned $3 million in revenue. 

If they'd just let us all use all the roads, it'll pay off in the long run. 

Bring in the rail system, quit fighting public transit options,   share the roads...  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> According to Mjr Nelson

- http://majornelson.com/2014/07/07/this-weeks-deals-with-gold-xbox-360-ultimate-games-sale/

Halo 4 DLC is going on sale tomorrow, right now it's $25.

Hopefully this'll spark some interest in H4 until this fall... The last DLC playlist was fun (4v4) but hopefully a BTB DLC playlist will happen (tired of playing same maps). 

Also wish this price drop was permanent, seeing how H4 is 50% off.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> How is XBOX (MSFT) allowing this app?

They phased out their own Windows Media Center (WMC) app because they are trying to encourage people away from physical media (audio/video) files. There is no way to pull media files from your PC/Network from the XBOX ONE. You can only push (Play to). Not much of an entertainment center (especially when the previous 360 could).

MSFT is trying to sell MUSIC/VIDEO digital rights   has partnered with major studios to do this. Also, they are trying to appease these studios that MSFT is actively fighting piracy is these tactics... 

Just don't understand why MSFT would allow this app when they have bent over backwards to make sure their own product can't pull files from their own Win 8 machines? 

On XBOX 360   Win 8, they nerfed their WMC. On 360, you couldn't view WMC as recent apps. You couldn't pin it to home. The only decent way to pull files was to hit the Guide, go to video, select from PC...

Cool to hear otherwise, much more of a XBMC fan myself. Have gotten away from files as well (why, when you can stream most everything?)

EDIT: Remember that just because you are in the ID program, doesn't mean it will be accepted by MSFT to the included in the Marketplace. Their apps aren't as easy to get into play as the apps for Win 8.  </TEXT>
