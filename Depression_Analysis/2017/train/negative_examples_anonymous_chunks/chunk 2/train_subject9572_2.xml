	<TEXT> I concur with what you're saying, but one point of correction:

 Many particles, such as electrons, are considered "point particles" in that they have zero dimension and take up exactly zero space. They have zero mass as well, and as such, travel at the speed of light.

That is not correct. You may be thinking of a photon. An electron does have mass and does not travel at the speed of light, maybe close but not equal to c.  </TEXT>

I would guess the overall mass of the proton is the determined by the quarks' direct interactions with the Higgs field plus the mass equivalent of the interaction energy between the quarks interacting with the Higgs field.

	<TEXT> I have a V shaped scar on my side just below my ribs. Happened when as an 8 year old I was climbing a tree with a friend.  He was out on the end of a branch and i was near the trunk on the same branch.  He climbed out a bit too far and branch gave way. We both fell.  He fell into a mud puddle and I fell onto a wire fence which impaled me in my side.  Luckily no internal organs were damaged but I received 32 stitches in the shape of a V.  I'm amazed I don't have a fear of heights and still like to climb. </TEXT>

It looks like a star since it's so far away and all of the stars in the galaxy appear to be collapsed to a single blob. Sniperchild is correct that the galaxy has a black hole in the middle, as almost all galaxies do.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The point of the article is that a mass of 3x the sun is sufficient, but just barely, to form a black hole.  This does not mean that all stars with a mass of 3x that of our sun are or become black holes.  It requires special conditions for a black hole of such a low mass to develop from gravitational collapse of a star.  Also, black holes with a mass much less than our sun are postulated to exist.  These primordial black holes do not form from the gravitational collapse of a star but are remnants from the big bang.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primordial_black_hole </TEXT>

That is one of the reasons the individual arrays are somewhat randomly rather than periodically placed.  

The toy comparison was a bit charged.  I am completely enthralled by the LHC and can't wait for full power operation.  I was only indicating it is small in size compared to this array. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's like saying "The pixel on a CCD would fit comfortably in this period."  But that's not the entire sensor.  Sure the central region would fit in the LHC, but the entire collection of arrays spans over 3000 km (see the end of the video).  The LHC at about 9 km in diameter is tiny compared to the entire array.  This array would derive its very fine spatial resolution from its large dimension.  That is what makes it impressive, not the central region by itself.  

Admittedly, this array may never be built.  But the scope would be impressive and the performance unprecedented if it were. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes, but in addition the odd shaped earth shows the strength of gravity varying around the globe with the yellow and red areas being the strongest and the blue areas being the weakest.  </TEXT>
