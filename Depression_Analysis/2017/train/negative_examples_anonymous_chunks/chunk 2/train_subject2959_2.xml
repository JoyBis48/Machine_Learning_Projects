	<TEXT> Just got a pair of Clarks Desert Boots in the mail, but I am confused on the sizing. I wear an 11 in Vans and dress shoes, so I ordered a 10.5 in CDBs. However, the shoes still feel somewhat big. Should I send them back and size down to a 10? Do CDBs usually fit loosely? (The fit of the shoe isn't bad, it just isn't perfect). </TEXT>
