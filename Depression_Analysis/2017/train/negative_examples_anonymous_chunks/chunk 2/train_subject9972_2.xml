**How the 4pack splitting works** 

+ I will trade the 4 pack for the listed price + a collateral 
+ You activate the 4 pack and the game gets added to your library and 3 extra copies in your steam inventory 
+ You trade the extra 3 copies for your collateral back 


***Collateral will the cost to cover the price of the full 2/3/4pack***     

*If you have a good steamtrades account / blue+ sgsflair , the collateral wont be needed*    



**Price for 4pack splitting**    

(Note: I value ToD as - 3 ref)

**How to check whether you are eligible for unpacking a 4pack**

First and Foremost, You MUST NOT own the game in your library  
Second, Follow these steps

+ Go to the steam store mainpage.
+ Add any game into your cart
+ Select Purchase as a gift

Your steam account is not eligible to open a 4pack if the page looks like this - http://i.imgur.com/nXTCSbt.jpg     
Normal Steam account with good standing will be directed to a page like this - http://i.imgur.com/odUbPpE.jpg

This is my currently build, and I'm afraid to buy Dayz thinking it wouldn't perform properly due to bad optimisations. 

Should this be enough to run the game without a hitch?

And I kinda want the game so leaving for a bit until they potentionally fix the optimisation is kinda not an option, since they may up the price a little bit then and stuff like that ... </TEXT>
