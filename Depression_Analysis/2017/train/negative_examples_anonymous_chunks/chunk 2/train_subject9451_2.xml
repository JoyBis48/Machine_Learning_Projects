	<TEXT> I feel like all the posts here are from non-Canadians. Here's a short summary of stereotyped Canadian culture from my experience living here all my life:

Yes we're usually nice. No we don't apologize for everything.

Tim Hortons makes the worst cup of coffee in the country.

Maple syrup is amazing. This is a fact.

We don't say "aboot" we just talk faster than Americans.

Our military is small because no one doesn't like us.

Tim Hortons coffee again. Seriously, they could burn iced cappuccinos. </TEXT>

Edit: Alterac and Isle are the only battlegrounds Alliance has a chance at winning in this battlegroup, so the other battlegrounds are fun. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Doesn't matter what demograph you fall under, if you perpetuate a negative stereotype, I have nothing but negative thoughts about you.

Not to pick on anyone in particular, but I used to see a guy in a wheelchair daily around my former place of work. Panhandled every single day, finally I got fed up with him. I asked why he can't work.

"I'm in a wheelchair!"

"How are your hands? Do they function?"

"Yeah, sure!"

There you go. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've caught myself doing this on a couple occasions, and its involved in political debates around the concept of separating religion and politics on a legal level. Making religious influence on politics barred comes up a lot in my circles, especially around topics of civil liberties.

Recently in the news, there's a athiest military pilot who is losing his contract soon because he won't make an oath to god. He has been willing to omit just the 4 or 5 words involving religion, but the U.S. Air Force is not moving on their position, and now face a civil rights lawsuit. </TEXT>

Poutine is trash. Waste of good fries. When you drown golden, crispy awesomesticks in gravy, and cheese curds *shudders*, all you get is an overpriced, soggy, disappointing meal. Might be better if any place can actually melt the cheese, or not use cheese curds (I really hate curds), but until that day, I'll take my money to buy a good plate of food, for probably cheaper. </TEXT>

One, the customer that literally can't shut up and let you work.

Two, the customer that barely acknowledges your existence, making it impossible to serve them.

Three, the customer that thinks "the customer is always right" justifies being a spineless piece of shit.

	<TEXT> Last time I went snowboarding, half the hill had some construction going on, but no one was checking to make sure the workers were staying in their area. Turns out they weren't, kicked up big rocks and shit, to be snowed over in a thin layer of white. So I go down the hill, hit one of the rocks. It knocks me over, I roll down into more rocks, nearly busting up my knee caps. If my aunt who was there wasn't a nurse, I probably would have gone to a hospital to see if theres any damage. I refuse to go down a hill again. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Running the same instances over and over to level cap is the reason I don't level tanks or healers anymore. I recently leveled a Forsaken rogue 1-90 in 74 playing hours exclusively with quests, give or take an hour or two farming what few low level (or any level) Alliance still play on Area 52. I try to visit areas I haven't been through in a long time, which dramatically improves the leveling experience.

As for endgame, Cataclysm, while having a few cool raid mechanics in some fights, was largely unchallenging; Pandaria is faceroll. Nearly cleared Mogushan Vaults in first week of raiding in 2012, which prompted me to take a year and half hiatus from the game, before returning for PvP this spring. Flexible raiding does improve the raid scene, while LFR is pure cancer (I haven't had a group that could clear any raid in months). Unfortunately, Blizzard doesn't know what the game needs anymore, and is leaving LFR while removing Flex.

If anyone decides to want to try WoW again, I would highly recommend avoiding any raids and switching to ranked PvP. Yes, most people are idiots and will throw games. Join a good guild, get some gear, and do some arenas and rated battlegrounds. At first it will likely be easy as you climb the rsting ladders, but around 2000 or higher rating, you'll get stuck. And that's where the challenged and the fun begins.

TL:DR; stop raiding, start beating up players, the PvE community is for filthy casuals. </TEXT>
