	<TITLE> Long term penny stock? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-08-13 15:15:43 </DATE>

	<TEXT> I'm relatively new to investing as a whole. So far in investing I put $1000 in GTAT at 16.50 and when it dropped to 13.90, I put another $1000 in. 

I know it's a big risk and honestly I don't really care. Not that I don't care about money but I'm 28 and I'm not tied up to any large financial burden. I would like to put $500 to $1,000 in a handful of penny stocks but not for day trading. I really would like to put my money in some up and coming companies.

I've been looking at a few weed stocks such as NGMC but also curious if weed does become nationally legalized if someone like Phillip Morris would just consume that market and change it's business model. 

Always curious about future tech companies; 3D printing, graphene, etc. 


- Penny stocks for long term investments? Speculative penny stocks with a real chance for a future?

	<TEXT> My listing package is a video virtual your ($200), Home Warranty Supplied for buyer ($400), agreement to have the house open every Saturday/Sunday for the first 6 weeks and I never use a lock box . If an agent wants to show the property I'm always present because who knows the house better, the listing agent or an agent that's never been inside. With that said I never negotiate commission and a lot of Realtors list for 1-2% and never do anything. Really get what you pay for. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's like 2-3 days ago on Shore Drive we had a helicopter, multiple boats, and 2 cruisers parked on the Lesner. I was listening on the police scanner from my place and they were looking for a kiteboarder until it was too dark to continue the search. My girlfriend works for WTKR and I asked her and she never heard anything and I never saw anything mentioning the search.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Great post for a newbie like myself. Question... If I still purchased $1000 when it was .10 and I sold it at $20.00 and I was an unknowing purchaser. Could I technically sell and walk away making a huge profit? Or because they are bouncing back and forth would it make it difficult for me to sell? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've put it down for clients before. As mentioned the preparation is everything. I spent 2 days cleaning (intense cleaning, acid etching to pull up the protective layer put on it) but actually putting the epoxy down only only took me a few hours (2 car garage). If you're interested I'll post some pictures of the finished product. We matched the shudders and people loved it. The house sold in 5 weeks, I'm not going to say that's why but it definitely helped the home show well.   </TEXT>
