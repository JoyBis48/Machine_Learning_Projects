	<TEXT> I agree with Krugman about being suspicious about bipartisan social program reductions to what are referred to as "entitlements," but the term should broaden to include subsidies to industry, transportation and energy sectors. Labeling government funds for these industries as subsidies wrongly places the funds outside the narrative of deficit reduction, particularly when energy companies are enjoying record-breaking profits on a yearly basis. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> After another viewing with special attention given to the archetypes and the director's explanation I've come to the conclusion that it ultimately didn't matter. From the minute the second lever was pulled, offering a blood sacrifice for a death that hadn't occurred, the final outcome had been determined. The director's explanation that in the rite the whore dies first, and the virgin last, but the order of the rest is left ambiguous. But it's a rite, and that means any step missed or taken out of order nullifies it. The big giveaway is when he pulls the second lever and both worlds experience an earthquake.

But leaving that aside, she fit the role of fool better than he fit it. In fact, of all the characters he was the least fooled of the group, and constantly called into question everything that was odd. His friends' odd personality changes, trying to stop the diary reading (drawing a line at the latin), finding the elevator - he recognized all these things. He could even be considered the virgin because of his uncomfortable reaction to the "whore" when she climbed on top of him. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I found the filmmaker's manipulation of longstanding societal sexual and drug norms especially interesting and funny. Just prior to all hell breaking loose, the controllers are popping champagne, while the girl, which they assume is the virgin, takes a horrible beating. The stoner is both the virgin and the hero, protected from manipulation by his weed. Sigourney Weaver tries to talk the girl into shooting the stoner, still believing the girl is the virgin, whose death the controllers are ambivilent about. The stoner as virgin was a smart twist to the story. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Let's begin with Meredith Vickers' role in the film, which is foil to David, the son her father never had, but remains imperfect because he doesn't possess a soul. She doesn't believe in the mission, but it offers her an opportunity to gain her father's respect, while also providing the means to out perform him. She, like her father, is obsessed with surviving, evidenced by the surgery machine, and her own living pod, which can operate independently of the ship. When the ship is threatened by possibly infected returning crewmen, she is willing to turn a flamethrower on them. As the ship begins its final push to intercept the "Engineer's" ship, she opts for an escape pod, knowing it only buys her a few more hours of life. When she discovers her father made the trip, she's lost her authority and any chance to out perform him, and all that's left is out living him. In the end, she had to die, crushed by the embodiment of her own disbelief. She dies soulless, like both David and her father. Of the three characters, David is the only one who really believed in the mission. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Good call on Roosevelt - he hated being called Teddy - because he was truly a giant in the fitness arena. He judged American manhood on its fitness, and overcame severe asthma to build a fit body. He was a good, if not great boxer, and rode horses for days at a time on cattle drives. He once threatened to "kick the balls" of a political colleague in the NY Senate, and knocked out a cowboy who called him four-eyes. He single-handedly captured and returned a cattle thief to the local sheriff, and during the 1912 election campaign suffered a gunshot wound by an assassin but still spoke for 1.5 hours before going to hospital. He also spent time hunting in Africa, and is the only American president to have ventured into the Amazon rain forest; he almost died on the expedition, and the jungle's effects remained with him for the rest of his short life. He was also our most mentally fit president who devoured books at an amazing rate. He is our most literate president, having written 21(?) books, and won the Nobel Peace Prize while in office for brokering peace between Japan and Russia. It's sad that the Republican Party doesn't recognize him, eschewing him as an independent instead, because he was truly a president who cared about the people. </TEXT>

The NAR issued guidelines designed to exclude African-american families from a community; also known as covenants, these rules included binding contracts signed by homeowners that declared the family would not sell their property to AAs. "White flight," assisted by the automobile, led to white middle- and working-class families moving farther from urban centers, and the development of suburbia. The rumors mentioned by the interviewees were fomented by the NAR because its members wanted to retain a monopoly position in setting housing prices. If class mixing became the norm, NAR representatives (realtors) could no longer charge customers inflated prices to maintain a white community. </TEXT>

David Stockman, the granddaddy of this movement, publicly admitted it was "voodoo economics" during a magazine interview, and stated it was the only way to sell the idea to the public. Dutch Reagan's greatest ability was as a shill, whether working for GE or the GOP, selling the idea of tax cuts for the wealthy to the blue-collar electorate. Sadly, this policy allowed industrialists and bankers to keep a majority of their profits, while moving their operations overseas to a cheaper labor market. Labor unions, the only real engine of change for the average working American, have been effectively rendered impotent. </TEXT>

Any argument regarding jesus's marital status is immediately suspect and subject to derision. A contemporary self-identifying christian would hardly recognize a 1st century christian, and they certainly wouldn't possess the necessary courage to die for it as did early christians. That christianity adopted much of the essenes's beliefs, especially baptism, is readily accepted by many roman history scholars, but remains a point of contention with religious fundamentalists.

The downvotes remind me that religion has no use for objective/subjective historical studies. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I took an undergrad Roman history class with a professor who told students on the first day of class that if they were christians, his lectures would offend them, and encouraged them to have an open mind. Invariably, he said, at least one student would complain to the dean and demand he change his lectures. In his lectures, he stated that jesus and mary magdalene were married, and offered as proof the biblical accounts of the Roman execution and the handling of jesus's body. Romans, he said, were very strict in the handling of dissident's bodies, and would only allow immediate family members or the wife to view the body. Roman leadership constantly monitored local attitudes to keep the masses in check, and restricting access to the dissident's body was one of those measures. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you, sir, for giving a very good example of the Republican voter; I, however, am an independent voter and offer analysis of the parties' messages to the nation. My generalization of Dems as inclusive is based in part on the conventions participants. Undeniably, the Republican convention participants presented a majority "white" conservative demographic, and on one occasion acted less than inclusive by shouting down a Republican Puerto Rico speaker. The Dems convention participants, on the other hand, offered a clear example of the "melting pot" mentality so proudly offered on the symbol of American freedom - the Statue of Liberty.

As for blaming Republicans on the credit downgrade, I'm going to repeat what I wrote earlier - Americans are not stupid. They also won't forget the Tea and Republican parties' roles in killing jobs bills that could offer American's employment. </TEXT>

During studies for my journalism degree, professors consistently insisted on objectivity in my writing, and that I backup my reporting with facts. Taibbi's writing is not objective, but it is substantive as he provides verifiable evidence. If forced to compare Taibbi to another historical figure, Will Rogers or Mark Twain jump to mind because they voiced opinions that spoke to their listeners/readers. Much like Rogers or Twain, Taibbi understands and voices the outrage experienced by the average American in relation to the contemporary political and economic situation.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I share your frustration with the sorry state of America's social system, and it's my major complaint with the Pro-life bunch in that any empathy for a child dissipates when it exits the womb. After that, it's the mother/father's responsibility to care for the child, regardless of the economic/social environment. Poverty is no longer confined to the urban landscape, as suburban cities are now experiencing the economic contractions and high unemployment. IMO the conservatives that agitate so strenuously for anti-abortion are also the ones that would cut social services because it encourages people not to work. I don't know one person who wants to be poor just to collect government assistance or health care. The poorest members of our society don't have the ready access to birth control, and may not even recognize they're pregnant. Having a child drastically changes the future economic options for parents, and if they're already in bad financial shape, the child will pay for it. I guess I'm angry that conservatives concern for children appears to stop at the womb. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So the contemporary U.S. is, by your definition, a fascist state? Corporate entities now represent America's interests, and the Supreme Court granted them personhood. In your representation of unions, you state the NRA "grouped workers into unions," however, in reality, unionization was a grassroots movement. It really began with the Wobblies in the late 1900s, but without government support, the movement went into hibernation. To aver that the government grouped workers into unions doesn't jibe with the research I've done the movement.

edit: I also meant to address your statement was not the same as the NRA, but it was an extension of the program. Now, the Supreme Court decided that portions of the NRA were indeed constitutional, in which case they were extended under a new program name. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My understanding of the Wagner Act is that it allowed the National Labor Relations Board to monitor union elections and assure no foul play. Prior to the Wagner Act, "workers could be beaten by supervisors and fired at will, and management determined the length of the workday and speed of the assembly line. (Give Me Liberty - Eric Foner p.813) As for the Works Progress Administration, it built 500k miles of roads, 600 airports, stadiums, sewage treatment plants, while also developing histories and guidebooks for all 48 states. The arts portion also painted murals in buildings, and compiled an oral history of the remaining slaves still alive.(Ibid, p818)

Now, that's my understanding of the Wagner Act and NRA. Before this conversation progresses any further, would you please give me your understanding of Fascism? And, perhaps the source from which you quoted, just so I can understand the context of FDR's words. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I believe the issue depends on who's doing the judging. For example, Theodore Roosevelt was extremely popular with the people, but the Republican party and industry considered his policies a disaster. When he declared large portions of land under federal jurisdiction in order to form the many national parks we now enjoy, Republicans and industry (railroads, lumber supply, mining) were enraged. By attacking the trusts, TR basically knee-capped the Republican fundraising machine. While historians still recognize the value of TR's policies in relation to the nation at large, Republicans still ignore him, or label him a Progressive. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> An attempt to explain Chicago's success and Detroit's decline is simply too restricted by the forum on reddit. I've listed three books below that explain in chilling detail the different routes both cities followed, and why Detroit languished. Vampire offers a general explanation but the books below delve into the social, class, and race aspects of the two cities. You may want to read Arc of Justice first because it is an easy and entertaining book about an African American man's dream to own a home, and white society's effort to crush that dream. Thomas Sugrue's book is for an academic audience, but it explains the socioeconomic blueprint for Detroit's urban decline. Sadly, this blueprint also explains the decline in what is now popularly known as the rustbelt. Finally, Cohen's book explains why Chicago grasped onto the New Deal programs which allowed the city to flourish. 

The origins of the urban crisis : race and inequality in postwar Detroit - Thomas Sugrue

Arc of justice a saga of race, civil rights, and murder in the Jazz Age - Kevin Boyle

	<TEXT> I've viewed some good answers below, however if we constrain the answer to "Cold War" and "communism", I can offer another opinion.
First, I'm defining communism as antithetical to capitalism, and a one party state governed by a single individual. Second, the Cold War is defined as the reaction to this struggle.

According to J.L. Gaddis, the roots of the cold war stretch to the brief American military intervention during the October Revolution. The distrust Stalin had for the US began during this period. Americans were seen as interlopers that embraced a capitalistic predation in order to control the masses. This is the view presented by George Kennan's Long Telegram and the beginning of US containment policy.

There is another much deeper element to this story however - the conflation of socialism with communism. In America's labor history, socialists play a very important role; they were great organizers and understood how to speak to the masses in relation to economic inequality and unfair working conditions. Socialists also created some very gifted writers. Often they recruited within the movie industry, a maven for creative writers. The socialist's impact on labor did not go unnoticed by the feds or Wall street. This conflation between socialism and communism was an ongoing process that accelerated during and after WWII. 

The cold war really caught fire with the House Committee on Un-American Activities in 1947. Former Hollywood notables (Ron Reagan) claimed the movie industry was rife with communists, resulting in HUAC and the Hollywood Blacklist.

On the government side, Joe McCarthy began a witch-hunt in the State Department. The American public had good reason to believe there were communist spies everywhere. During this period the feds uncovered the Silvermaster Group and the Rosenburgs, while the Brits nabbed Alger Hiss. McCarthy's hunt finally ended when he took on the Army; the backlash ended his political career, and alcohol took his life.

There you have it...I don't feel like typing anymore. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you decide to pursue a graduate degree in history, the seminar on historical methods is usually required in the first semester/quarter. Hayden White, Karl Marx, Leopold van Ranke, Jacob Burckhardt, and Immanuel Kant are usually included because they represent different styles of historical research. White's thesis in *Metahistory* is that when a historian writes about an event, they use a historical method of writing such as Marxist, post-modern, revisionist, Annales, big history, and so on. Contemporary historians can identify the writer's method by studying the linguistic properties utilized. What Mr_Quacky alluded to "when historians write 'History' with a capital H" is that the winners in a conflict will write the history of that conflict in a manner with which the reader identifies. By studying the historian's use of language, the reader is able to identify the objective vs. subjective argument that is the framework of the underlying narrative. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> He's correct on a lot of levels, but especially in relation to branding the "other." Racial politics and branding span the entirety of U.S. politics; Jefferson was smeared by his opponents for his affair with a slave. More importantly, most Americans are so limited in their knowledge of U.S. history that they believe race was defined in the white and black dichotomy. In *Wages of Whiteness: Race and the Making of the American Working Class*, David Roediger writes about the different layers of whiteness, with Irish and East European personages falling under the umbrella of the "negro." Home ownership became the main vehicle for this group to earn their "white" designation. Owning a home implied a person was trustworthy, hardworking, and stable.  </TEXT>

This is simply untrue. TR changed the Civil Service process to include an exam to qualify that the applicant was indeed fit for the job. Before TR's changes, civil service positions were used by politicians as a means of reward for their friends. He changed civil service by replacing a system where jobs were sold to the highest bidder with a merit system based on examination. His trust busting campaigns also earned him scorn from contemporary wealthy scions and his own Republican Party. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The major reason the South voted Democrat centers around the wide-spread use of voter suppression methods to restrict black voting. The Republican's waving of the "bloody shirt" and its moniker, the Party of Lincoln, resounded among black voters but the Southern Democrats used legal/extralegal intimidation to keep African-American voters at home on election day. Voter suppression remained a problem well into the 1960s, culminating in the "Freedom Riders" who actively worked to register Southern AA. Sadly, some of those who participated lost their lives to the cause.

Lyndon Johnson's welfare legislation was intended to help AA transition from a position of poverty with the Great Society programs. Johnson said, "You do not take a person who, for years, has been hobbled by chains and liberate him, bring him up to the starting line of a race and then say, `You are free to compete with an the others,' and still justly believe that you have been completely fair."

When Nixon arrived in office he began dismantling Great Society programs, a trend that has continued with every Republican president. Because AA are especially sensitive to the need for a strong social safety net, they tend to vote Democrat now. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Christian's argument is that the ability to increase productivity enough to sustain a large population was absolutely necessary to the formation of a civilization. An example of this can be found in the multitude of indigenous tribes that formed in early North America. Lacking access to draft animals for the plowing of land, indigenous Americans could only produce enough sustainable foodstuffs for a very small population. As a result, the impetus to join together into larger communities was almost nonexistent. The only North American example I can think of is the Anasazi (Chaco Canyon) and it fell long before the Spanish arrived.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I completely understand the author's dilemma, and her logic in the solution. I also understand why she'd want to finish a degree with Duke. I've spent a lifetime collecting degrees, but none of them come with a pedigree. Really, who would a HR person rather hire, someone with a BA from Metropolitan State College of Denver or from Duke University? Do I want an employee from Austin Peay State University or from Vanderbilt?

I also shared her belief that an education could lift me out of extreme poverty. In today's economic climate, an extensive education can also exclude an individual from a job's consideration. Employers believe that individuals with graduate degrees will jump ship the minute a better job appears, so they pass on them. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I predict:

With its supply lines cut by Pakistan, the U.S. pulls out all troops by July 2013. Seeing a power vacuum in the region, Pakistan exploits its ties to the Taliban, creating a puppet state. China and Russia extend support to Pakistan in an effort to offset the U.S.'s presence in Asia. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't believe protesters should just carry the American flag, they should wrap themselves in the flag as if it's a shawl. As a photojournalist, the imagery of kneeling protesters wrapped in the American flag and being beaten or pepper sprayed would be a dream photograph. It's a win-win situation because the cops will look horrible defaming such a powerful American symbol. It'd be priceless to see how Fox news would spin any violence directed toward the protesters, and Jon Stewart's Daily Show would eat it up. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I see the OWS as a blend of the Populist and Progressive movements. Progressives, such as Jacob Riis,Upton Sinclair, and Teddy Roosevelt, saw the economic effects of business trusts on poor and working-class urban/rural Americans and were appalled. The Populist movement was hampered by what the average American considered the socialist and anarchist threats. These fears of a eastern European horde immigrating into the U.S. resulted in the 1924 Johnson-Reed Act that restricted southern and eastern European immigration. This movement also had strong nationalistic tendencies, which I see as a direct correlation to the contemporary Tea Party movement. </TEXT>
