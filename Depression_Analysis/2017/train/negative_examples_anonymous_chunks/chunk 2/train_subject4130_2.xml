I got into a debate on r/halo about it. The thread about stop saying halo is dead. And I mentioned this exact video and got called on it. When people, especially YouTubers do this, it hurts halo. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> GOD DAMIT. I didn't really want her involved. 

Edit: Damn. I got negged to shit. They killed her off in halo 4 in an epic way. It would be cheap to bring her back and make the whole reason chief went AWOL, and by extension Locke's mission about cortana. So we're going to spend  that whole campaign hunting chief or playing as chief......   for cortana. Come on. That's so cheap and predictable </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Pertaining to MCC. They do deserve the criticism. But at this point its beating a dead horse. Going on about it at this point does nothing. They put their name on games like spartan assault, MCC, and others because they are the franchise. This doesn't mean they focused on it while taking away from the main project.

I wouldn't say their priorities are broken. They had a very specific timeframe to release things with two completely separate teams. Plus, they needed to have enough time to implement beta feedback. Why delay the beta and put that project at risk because of MCC. To many chefs in the kitchen isn't a good thing. And the overwhelming majority at 343 are on h5.

343 aren't the ones working on ODST and relic. Saber and certain affinity are the ones on that. They didn't even start ODST until after release.

They released Forge Island based on feedback, changed in game H4 settings for feedback, H5 is being changed based on feedback. They are listening to the general consensus on things

343 is a competent company. Only real fuck up this gen was MCCs release. Everything else has been fine. It's just that Dobbins is beating a dead horse. 343 knows that MCC had a shitty release and they know people disliked h4; they've heard it a million times. At this point it adds nothing to discussion and Dobbins perpetuates this attitude toward halo that doesn't help. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No, his anger and frustration are what is needed for 343 to get their head out of their wallets and realize what people want. It's the ignorance of so many people like yourself that just assume 343 is going to pull through when their record shows they have failed at everything they have done before. 

Halo 4, fail. Did they alter anything quickly to fix the problems, hell no, they were focused on MCC. MCC, fail. Have they altered and patched the problems accordingly, no. They have taken their time because the majority of their team is on Halo 5.

You assume that they fully developed MCC. It makes no sense to take people off halo 5 to work on MCC. None at all. Plus you assume they could have just altered some shit and and it would have been all hunky dory.

Now with that track record, the only record 343 has with games, what makes you think H5 is going to be any different? Dobbins and others who criticize them, like myself, don't wish for Halo to fail, but want people to stop accepting and promoting 343 to just keep doing what they are doing. All he is saying is don't listen to this bullshit 'Locke vs. Chief' hype and pre-order or buy this game before you know what you're getting. 

You assume people dont know what they're getting, even though they've played a beta that they enjoyed. One that ran more smooth than MCC. Criticism is fine. Making click bait circle jerk titles like "you hate halo if you pre-order halo 5" is not.

Look at it this way, Bungie took 3 years to produce each of their 4 games from Halo CE to Reach, 343 will have produced 3 games in 3 years with DLC already in the works prior to H5 release. Priorities have been set for 343 and it's worth betting that they have not learned from their mistakes with the way things have been going

You straight up assume 343 has hands on developed every halo title. They had other studios do them while they focused on the main title at hand (H5) You also assume they have DLC in development. The MCC dlc is being done by separate companies while 343 is focused on H5. They still stick to the 3 year dev cycle.

You also assume 343 hasn't done anything right. Even though we have HCS, good lore, and had a well received beta. 

You also seem to assume they aren't listening to any feedback, even though they have the feedback program and made a halo 5 update post where they flat out implemented community feedback. Just because they aren't listening to *your* feedback, and dobbins. Doesn't mean they aren't listening. 

Dobbins really is leading an overreacted crusade against nothing. And hurting halo in the process. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> At least that was black and white. Shoot the big blargy aliens. It was an epic struggle. 

But if the UNSC and humanity are flung into a legitimate civil war, the floods possible return, Halsey/Jul with the Janus Key, and covie religion making a comeback. I'd say that's pretty bad. But I doubt it'll happen </TEXT>

	<TEXT> - HCS is rising and the competitive scene is beginning to rise again
- Lore has been handled wonderfully with books, comics, and merch.
- Halo is gaining more content creators, YouTubers, and fan sites. Compared to the dying of Reach and 4
- Halo 5 is looking extremely promising so far. From a story perspective and MP
- MCC is functional, 343 is working around the clock to bring the next TU.
- no longer is this sub and every halo forum filled with anti 343 circle jerk. We are seeing discussion, awesome clips and more. 

Halo isn't dad. We just have to accept that halo isn't the top dog mainstream game anymore. And work to be a friendly community newcomers want to be apart of.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Dobbins posted a video called "if you pre order halo 5 you hate halo" the thumbnail was "do you hate halo?" And he acts like he's in some fucking crusade to save halo by bashing it.

His intentions may be good, but perpetuating halo hate is undeniably bad for the franchise. The comments on that video were just a huge circlejerk that said fuck 343.  </TEXT>
