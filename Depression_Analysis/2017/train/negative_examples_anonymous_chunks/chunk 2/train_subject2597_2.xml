	<TEXT> As seen in the [Construction cam] (http://www.cubuffs.com/ViewArticle.dbml?ATCLID=209458799) the beams are going up. The first beam was erected a couple weeks ago. The height looks odd because a good amount of the facility is underground from the camera angle. The facility is 80ft tall with a full sized track surrounding the football field.   </TEXT>

	<TITLE> why I stopped using protein/mass powders </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-06-11 01:55:19 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I had been using protein shake mixes for years on and off without much gaining. It finally hit me one day that I wouldn't eat for hours after having a shake, they made me feel too full and slightly nauseous. I instead started using preworkout and creatine only, I had used them with shakes beforehand. I drink 3-4 glasses of chocolate milk each day, two immediately after a workout. I noticed I was eating more and now have gained  20 lbs since giving up protein shakes a few months ago. I'm not sure why I'm posting this except to tell anyone who gets irritation from shakes to try something else. There's no universal meal plan for gainers, just meet you calorie goal and eat "healthy" foods.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I know nothing about the process of adding intramural sports but is anyone interested in intramural lacrosse? I'm guessing the only way to make it happen would be playing no-contact or possibly using women's sticks and rules. Liability comes with physicality. The school has the lacrosse field and goals. Participants would likely need their own equipment. The only real cost to the school would be more refs. 
If anyone knows more about the process or works with the rec center it would be great to get the ball rolling. Lacrosse is the fastest growing sport and Colorado could become the lacrosse capital of the West since the outlaws professional team is good and DU won nationals.  </TEXT>

[Fly through] (https://vimeo.com/91724467)

Construction of a 120,000-square-foot indoor multipurpose practice facility on top of Franklin Field, to include a 100-yard artificial turf football field and six-lane 300-meter track;
Refurbishment of the Dal Ward Athletics Center, completed in 1991, to include an Olympic sports strength training room in the sub-basement level and new locker rooms and equipment room on the field level;
Redesigning of Dal Ward's first floor for the expansion of Olympic sports/sports medicine, a leadership development center and an end zone club with club seating and loge boxes;
Transforming the second floor of Dal Ward to triple the athletic department's academic support system from its current 5,000 square feet to 15,000 square feet;
Building additional restrooms and concession areas on the east side of Folsom Field; and
Adding a 21,900-square foot high-performance sports center on the northeast corner of the stadium, as well as a rooftop terrace on the northeast corner, converting the south offices at Folsom Field to retail space. The rooftop terrace will generate revenue by being available for rent for non-game-day events. The high-performance sports center will host collaborative research conducted by CU-Boulder Integrative Physiology faculty and researchers at the CU Anschutz Medical Campus.

	<TEXT> CU is hosting its first field day tomorrow. Students can play yard games or compete against football players in skills stations such as throwing, kicking, catching, 40 yard dash etc. As a student I'm looking forward to it and was wondering if other schools do this. Specifically with CU, its a great way for the program to branch out to the students who have formed some hostility for the program.  </TEXT>

I cannot do both because of when classes are available and I am graduating in the fall. I want to get a job in health administration and possibly continue on to graduate school for a MHA. Which path above should I take? My major is in physiology which isn't direclty applicable  to Health administration but I do know some people who landed jobs with similar majors.  </TEXT>
