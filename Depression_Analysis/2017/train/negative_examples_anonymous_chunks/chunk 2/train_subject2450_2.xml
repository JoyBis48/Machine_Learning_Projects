	<TEXT> The idea that you want to be a mod r/politicalmoderation just bolsters the belief that all you are interested in is stifling discussion on Reddit. It doesn't matter how good or bad a moderator you are. By allowing you to mod this site you will successfully mute this community. It seems your only interest is in stopping people from fingering you for the damage you have caused to our communities. 

The name of of this website is Reddit not TheRedditPope. You want influence at this subreddit speak but leave the moderating to others who are more capable and honest. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Why are you getting involved in this discussion? I thought you are no longer a moderator of r/politics. It was pulled but it may be back now to save face. 

Here is the comment made to me by Luster in a response to mod mail.

[I did not remove it, but I agree with its removal](http://www.reddit.com/message/messages/1hy7uq)

You can see Luster later in the thread is looking to ban me for being a shill for the AP, the largest new organization in the US. He doesn't even know how AP works. I have never been paid by AP for writing anything. But facts probably will not be enough to stop the r/politics mods from doing what they are going to do. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My comment to them:

The man whose song, We Shall Overcome, was adopted to lead the Civil Rights movement; the man whose songs led the Vietnam War protests; a leader in the struggle for human rights, social justice has died but his death is off-topic for politics. I really don't know what country you live in. This is one insult too many. Please leave the stage now your judgement is flawed. Your rules are inane and your political prejudices are too big.

	<TEXT> Thanks for pointing out that some progressive/left sites are not stellar examples of journalism. That doesn't mean they should be banned but they should not dominate r/politics. It is sites like alternet and other fringe left sites that allow the right-wing mods to make false equivalents between left and right websites. There is nothing on the left that is equivalent of breitbart.com or Fox News. </TEXT>
