	<TEXT> nope...raised 3 kids for 20 years, and received child support until the youngest turned 8, and a whole whopping $3000 one time payment of alimony...I refused to fight about it in front of the kids and he got nasty so I just signed the papers...oh and since the divorce he has literally had NOTHING to do with the kids, not even a birthday card...and he earns roughly 100k a year, while I made $20,000...but I do know this, I am MUCH happier now

	<TEXT> Im no expert, but it sounds to me like you are watering too often...with my plants I water about once a week, being sure to let the top inch or so of soil dryout before I water again, and yes, remove all dead leaves, this will help the plant....when I water I water until it runs out of the bottom, making sure to let it drain well and not leave any water in the saucer, since many plants do not like their feet wet
Hope this helps

	<TEXT> I have personally worked with quite a lot of people who actually SHOULD have been on disability...bad knees...bad back...one lady who walked completely hunched over all of the time...mostly age related issues, but I had to bust my hump twice as hard when I worked with them, because even though they were trying, they just couldn't do it...I think SS needs to be expanded myself </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My charter bill for the same services was about 185 a month, I called a couple of times to see if I could get it lowered, no dice, so I cancelled my cable completely,about 2 months ago which dropped my bill to 95 a month, they called me tonight and offered to give me back my cable for $103 for the next 12 months.  I took it because my bf loves sports and it's only another $8 a month. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The Fact alone that 4 BILLION DOLLARS was spent on the Mid-term elections should be a wake-up call to everyone.  Just think about what that money could have done to make our country a better place to live!
Public funding only for campaigns really needs to happen.  Our representatives don't spend very much time working for us at all.  They are out fundraising most of the time.  I read somewhere recently that they usually are in Washington 2 days a week tops. </TEXT>
