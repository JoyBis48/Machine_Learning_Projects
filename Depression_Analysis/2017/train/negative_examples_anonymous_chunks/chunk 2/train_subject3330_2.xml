	<TEXT> Its your plans for the day using your preferred calendar.

If you have nothing on your calendar today then it will show no events. 

Create something for tomorrow at say 6pm and it will give you a notification / reminder close to that time. 

Or if you check your agenda manually with that option it will show up. 

TLDR; you have nothing planned in your calender today.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Cook in bulk and freeze portions to take to work over three days, after that you should have enough to alternate between for the next week or two.  Saving you both time and money if you don't like to cook. 

If freezing doesn't work for you just make enough for the following day and keep in the fridge. Stirfrys, pastas etc are quick, cheap and offer plenty of variety. 

Or get up earlier than you usually would  to prepare a lunch. Sandwiches and the like. 

Not only will you save money and eat better, you'll also learn new skills in cooking which is always a good thing later in life. 

Limit yourself to buying lunch to once a week.

Don't like any of the above advice? Then continue with what you're doing. You'll either get another job making more money or you'll change your lifestyle.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Witnessing the Next Step in Money. Maybe.

There have been payment options with your phone via NFC etc. available for quite a while now, just because Apple is now entering the ring does not mean they are the best or on the forefront. 

I hate articles like this and brand worship in general. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah I also ordered from Yatango as soon as it became available... Shortly after they changed the pricing upwards and demanded I pay the difference or cancel... Then they say the order is delayed for a further 30 days... then recently they said possibly another 30 days.

I cancelled, got a full refund then ordered from a Melbourne based ebay seller on Thursday for $300. It arrived yesterday. 

Yatango is horrible when it comes to importing.  </TEXT>

Uhh they're a bit behind there, Smart Watches have been around a while now, with the latest being the Moto360 touting Android Wear.

But hey, anything apple is on the forefront of technology right?

Guess Time is pandering to a certain demographic with this one.
