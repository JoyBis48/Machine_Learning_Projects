	<TEXT> Watchmen - a panel by panel adaption of the comics with the depth of the characters taken out and replaced with poor acting and an emotionless ending. Anything remotely clever in the movie is pegged from the comics, but there was cleverer stuff in there that they ignored. I dislike Snyder's visual style very much and the movie ended up looking like one of the numerous comic imitators of the 80s. Gilliam was right - it was unfilmable. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Y: The Last Man - it is my go to comic for proving that comics aren't for children or cape enthusiasts and don't have to be dark and edgy to be great. The characters are great and binge reading it reminds me of binge watching a season of an excellent TV show. The dialogue is smart and quippy and the plot - whilst a riff on a Mary Shelly novel - is quite original in this modern age.

I'd easily recommend it other one of Bryan K Vaughan's other works like Saga - which continuously falls into the trap of "we're allowed to do anything, so we shall." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Lord of the Rings - hear me out. I wasn't really enjoying it from the get-go, but I was watching it with a group of friends who kept insisting the next part of the trilogy was better. The films did get progressively better, but they still weren't *that* good. I was largely bored and uninterested in the characters, the only thing that really interested me was the lore. As a result, I felt like I wasted 9 hours on mediocre movies (and I know I could have skipped the last half-hour of Return of the King). I appreciate the love and hard-work that went into making them, it just didn't click with me.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree with you on everything, but generalising CBMs. I agree that some people are getting tired of Superhero movies, but I bet those people would kill to see more movies like Sin City, The History of Violence and V for Vendetta (even the Zack Snyder movies I'm not a fan of).

There are so many great comics I'd rather see get an adaption than a C-list Marvel hero - I say this a massive Marvel Comics fan. I'd like to see Maus, East of West, Saga or Y: The Last Man come to the big screen before Ant-Man.  </TEXT>

I love those movies, but most of them are quite dated and may seem kind of silly. I think that might off-put people. If they really enjoyed Casino Royale and Skyfall, they should backtrack to the Connery and Moore films (I don't like the Brosnan ones - the dialogue in them is pretty poor). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you must watch any two, watch Casino Royale and Skyfall. Casino Royale is a well-crafted thriller set to a backdrop of an extremely high-stakes poker game and Skyfall is a beautifullly shot thriller  about a man rebuilding himself after a great loss. Both have great action setpieces and surprisingly decent character work, but what makes them really great is watching the world around Bond change and grow. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't think I can give an explanation that can rival some of the other users on this thread, but can I recommend John Ostrander's Suicide Squad run? It has a different team to the movie, but I think that's the vibe they're going for. It's surprisingly good and worth a read. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, Supes is Invincible, but that doesn't make him boring - bad writing makes him boring. The best Superman stories involve moral conflict over his actions or the impact his presence has on other people. The bad ones just have him punch stuff for 22 pages.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes and I'm saying Marvel Studios, Warner Brothers, Fox and Sony need to mix it up much more.

You can either make Wonder Woman a boring, female Superman or you could create a Game of Thrones-style fantasy world for her to inhabit and have her face a more personal threat.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Astonishing X-Men. It's written by Joss Whedon (writer-director of Age of Ultron) and drawn by John Cassaday (who Disney had enough faith in to allow him to draw Star Wars). It features lots of quirky one-liners, great characters and a very similar team dynamic. It's 24 issues, then a Giant-Sized special.


If you have Netflix, I recommended giving Firefly a watch. It has far more in common with Age of Ultron than you'd think (beyond Joss Whedon). It's 14 episodes, then a two-hour movie. 

Edit: I feel the need to explain myself - despite, the fact no-one has explained why they disagree with me. Astonishing X-Men is the comic equivalent to Age of Ultron (which I've seen). It includes heavy themes, but handles them with genuinely funny humour and has a well-balanced cast of characters that is so perfectly Joss Whedon. There is no comic that comes closer to replicating the feeling of Age of Ultron in my opinion and frankly, it's better than a lot of other comics recommend here. Yes, it does star the X-Men, but it should still excite you so much more for the film than reading the (equally great) Hickman run as it's closer to what you should expect from the film.  The same goes for Firefly.  </TEXT>
