	<TEXT> Haha, well at least 50% is on something in that crowd, a friend of mine works in the camera crew of Q-dance, and his only job is to literally find people who look kinda sober enough to put in the aftermovie.

and ofcourse, you know... filming the hotties.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> didn't know i was talking to someone who knows what he's talking about, and i agree with everything you say its just a bit to much, on the one hand its all house remixes, and on the raw hardstyle hand its only hardcore kicks with screeches! 

But as far as the shows go (and thats why i posted it), you can't disagree that its pretty epic.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This can't be a coincidence. Two weeks ago i remember waking up in the middle of the night. Still dreaming i'm looking at my phone thinking "well its 02:00, time to take a shower". I'm showering, grabbing my bag for work, i'm fully clothed, i'm almost ready to go make breakfast. While i'm grabbing my phone for a quick look. THATS when i realize its 2 in the fucking morning and i can sleep for at least 4,5 hours before my alarm goes off... It was one of the most confusing things when i slowly started realizing what happened. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Look for Qlimax 2014, happened last weekend. Hardstyle maybe is a bit unknown in a very big part of the world. But its growing, and the shows they give in the stadiums are crazy. Lots of indoor fireworks.
