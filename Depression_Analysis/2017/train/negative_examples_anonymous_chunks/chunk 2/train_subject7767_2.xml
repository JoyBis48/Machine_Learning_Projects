	<TEXT> every car is black/white/grey.

We had to look forEVER to find the right car that wasn't black/white/silver.  Like a year or more (used car).

Here's a cool time lapse of cars in San Diego where they are all separated into color. http://vimeo.com/82038912 look at how many white/grey/black cars then count the rest of them.

There's like 2-3 seconds of blue and one pure yellow (sentra on the top) and one orange (WRX). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Back when game distribution wasn't that good, you had to pre-order games in order to ensure that when it came out, you could actually get a copy.  Now you can get virtually every new release in a digital download format, therefore there is an unlimited supply of games.

So, with that being said there is actually 0 reason to pre order a game.  Games will go on sale after they are released.  all pre orders do now is just give game companies money for stuff they haven't done yet.  They know they can just rush games out, un polished, buggy, and patch it up later if need be.  But they don't need to do that, because they'll just work on the next half baked big IP game and shovel in more money from those pre orders. </TEXT>

I like the sound of the [Stillen Exhaust](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw41sSRZ4mU) as well. 

Both of those combined should give you a 30+hp boost for about $2k total.

If you go big, then you can go with a supercharger or Twin turbo kit, but those can be upwards of $10k and get you to 500+ hp at the crank </TEXT>

They say they are working on it, but damn, they've been out for a year and nothing.

I'm sure they've done all they can, but Sony isn't letting them have the rights to it for some reason.  </TEXT>

I had THOUSANDS of points at the end of the summer and got SO much crap most of it was pretty decent. </TEXT>

There's a saying..."The more you pay, the less you get".  Take the Porsche 911 GT3 RS.  It's a stripped down light-weight, no frills version of the GT3, but it costs a lot more.

Friend of wife = MS in Biochem with 8 yrs exp making 48k/yr here.

The market is flooded here and companies are taking advantage.  Go elsewhere or do something else.

	<TEXT> There is a difference between a Skyline, and a Skyline GT-R (R3x).  I don't think they make a Skyline GT-R since the new platform in 2003.  It's just Skyline 350GT (G35) or the GT-R (R35).

If the kid has GT-R badges, then that's stupid.  If he swapped Infiniti for Skyline...there's nothing wrong with that. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Technically it IS a Skyline, but it's not an R35 by any means. Just because it was "imported" doesn't make it any better (even if it were true).  If I had a 280hp car in High school, i'd feel pretty damn proud of it too. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I did the same thing at Best Buy.  I was a hourly department manager (not a supervisor, only one in the store) and there were 4-5 Assistant store managers.  

I was making $21/hr + up to 40% bonuses.  They were flat 55-60k/yr + x% bonuses.

They weren't making their numbers to get bonuses, working 50hrs a week (60 for the holidays) and I was at 40 hrs/wk hitting max bonus numbers and had OT when I needed to work more.

After I left, one of the AM's "demoted" herself to my spot.  Same money, less work load. </TEXT>
