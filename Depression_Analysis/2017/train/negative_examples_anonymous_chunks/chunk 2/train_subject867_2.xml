	<TEXT> We get a 30% discount, but Amazon still sells their books cheaper. Amazon is my shit, but don't tell my manager. The 40% discount at the cafe is actually great tho. I started in October 2014, so I haven't been working here too long, and it's just a part-time job because I'm 18. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The weekdays are typically super slow, especially if you're back in the music/dvd section, where I usually work. Sometimes I'll have only like four or five customers within 4.5 hours. I don't even know why that section is even still open. The weekends get a little better. The B N I work at is part of an outdoor shopping complex and when there are special events at the complex we get a shit ton of customers, mostly annoying 13 year olds. 

At any time, our most requested books are ones that kids have to read for school like Macbeth, A Brave New World, Animal Farm, etc. This being Texas, bibles and American Sniper are really popular. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A couple week ago a young guy came in reeking of weed and pizza and asked if we had a Raising Farm Animals for Dummies book. We actually had something similar but he ended up just getting a magazine. </TEXT>
