	<TEXT>  These are two different things.

That's my point... you lumped it together. And

 Long story short, I've been writing "apps" since a decade before they were called "apps" and long before you had pubic hair

And another way you make yourself look like a d-bag by rubber stamping your authority. It sounds like you are over-compensating for something. Someone with 15 years experience doesn't tell you they have 15 years of experience unless:

* Their experience came into question
* They are lying
* They are insecure and worried no one will take them seriously

It can't be the first option, because you mentioned your experience before we even began talking. You entered a conversation and jumped in with an irrelevant opinion, and bragging of your experience. You reek with artificial superiority.

But please tell me how you were doing X while I was doing something only a child does. That really makes you appear mature and above childish arguments. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Who the hell refers to iOS apps as 'web apps'? Web app implies an app through a browser. So anything that gets information from the web is a 'web app'? Well that's new! (sarcasm)

 Edit: They are called fucking Fig Newtons, I'm reading it off the box you idiot.

wtf?

And I like how you bragged and gloated "I'm the shit and know more than you (even though I didn't even ask what you know) and I've been doing this for 15 years" - when your rant wasn't even relevant, neither was your AMAZING experience in 'app' development. Like who gives a crap? We are talking about naming conventions of the OS versions. If you didn't come off like a pompous douchebag, I probably wouldn't have said anything. 

At least I don't claim to know everything. I simply attacked your statements. At no point did I say, "I know more than you" or did I say I have "x years of experience and I am and expert in the field". You put yourself on a pedestal, so I tried to knock you on your pretentious ass. Maybe if you were more clear wtf you meant the first time around (and weren't a complete tool), then we wouldn't be here right now. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Opinion? Can you please tell me what web apps are coded in Objective C or Swift? Most web apps aren't even written nowadays in Java anyway (even though you could).

Either way you were complaining about *Android*, which has nothing to do with web apps or web sites. 

I Googled nothing. And again, your rant is irrelevant and seems to show your ignorance and blatant Android hating based on nothing. 

Have you ever even written an Android app? Sounds like you have not, which makes your rant really stupid. I say you have not written an Android app because you said:

 I've written websites and web apps for 15 years

As if that somehow makes you qualified to give an opinion on coding Android or iOS.

	<TEXT> Dude no one gives a crap about your rant here... go complain on /r/shittyprogramming or something. 

 TL;DR ~ I've coded both. I've written websites and web apps for 15 years. I've written apps since before you even knew the word was associated with something other than that small meal you eat before your actual meal.

Um who was talking about 'both'? And what do websites and web apps have to do with Android and iOS (and who was talking about iOS anyway?)

Last I checked Android is written in Java, iOS in Obj-C/Swift - web apps are written in CSS/HTML/Javascript/PHP/C#/etc. So either you are full of crap or too lazy to actually say what you mean. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  The cost of living is also above the national average. Relatively decent pay also prevents people from going to improved settings.

Not compared to other major cities where teachers make *less* money than Chicago, and their cost of living is *higher*. Chicago teachers have it **very well**, even the more so when accounting for cost of living. 

Example - cost of living is much higher in New York - yet they make less than Chicago teachers. In fact, if you account for living expenses, it makes Chicago salaries almost 50% higher than New York. </TEXT>

Well there are two years of garbage (humanities english history math you probably will never use, even in CS..). The other two years is a lot of concepts, and coding that you end up having to teach yourself anyway.

This seems really simple, and I feel like I'm going to be embarrassed when I find out how to do this:

I want to take a file, to a find/replace using sed - however I don't want to make changes to the existing file - I want to keep the original file, but create a new file (or overwrite an existing file).

This is an example I found, but it does it in place:

    sed -i 's/original/new/g' file.txt

However in this case, file.txt has now been changed. I want to keep file.txt as-is, and create a new file `newFile.txt` instead.

Help?

	<TEXT>  img{
     width: 100%;
     max-width: 900px; /*or whatever number you fancy*/
 }

So that makes it look better in the browser, but now on my phone it seems to default to 900px (which is wider than the phone). 

Why does that happen? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So on the phone I want it to expand to the edges, but on desktop, if it expands to the edges its simply too large. 

I guess ideally I would want the picture to expand to a max number of pixels, which I think someone else has made that suggestion. 

EDIT: I like how you restructured the CSS. Thanks!
I am actually changing the picture to a different Rabbi, which has a ratio that is taller, and not wider.

EDIT: Although why the specific sizes for the text? Why not just use h1, h2, h3 etc?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> [Here](http://www.askyourlor.com) is a simple website that I am working on. I want it to display some text, and then a picture. The problem I am having is that it either looks great on mobile or desktop: but not both.

I'm using the 

     meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"

line to help with mobile (although I don't completely understand what it does). However the following code seems to make the picture too large on desktop:

        img {
            max-width: 100%;
        }

If I change the max-width to 60%, then it looks great on desktop, but the pic is then too small on mobile (it doesn't go all the way to the edges). 

Any help out there?
EDIT: Any other suggestions on my website are completely welcomed. And don't ask about the content.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It says this about Free Transfer Ticket -

 Why is there no Transfer button on my event in My Account?
Could be one of these:

 The venue doesn't offer Ticket Transfer yet (we're working on that)
The artist or venue turned Ticket Transfer off for that event/section

So it's possible that you can't. Will you be able to return the ticket? That's what I'm wondering. Their policy says up to 7 days, but this event could be excluded.

I have an Amex Business Plat card, and they can protect returns up to a certain amount (not sure how much).

EDIT: Amex will only cover up to $300. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Powerball odds are around 1 in 170 million. I would probably say there won't be more than 10 million people trying to get the ticket at exactly 3 pm (and that is probably a gross overestimation). There are 500 tickets. So odds are 500 in 10,000,000, or 5 in 100,000, or really, 1 in 20,000. 

1 in 20,000 is significantly better than 1 in 170,000,000. 

So your odds of getting one of these tickets is 8500 times greater than winning the Powerball. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So tickets go on sale at 3pm ET. Three places to get them:

* Ticketmaster.com
* Mgmgrand.com/mayweather
* Calling 800-745-300 (only 9 digits?)

So I guess the questions would be:

* Way to have the best odds of getting a ticket (there are only 500)
* Which ticket will have the *lowest* demand?
* Which ticket will give you the best return (total return, not percentage)

Since there are only 500 tickets going on sale, it will be almost impossible to get them, even if you go to the website at exactly 3pm. 

My theory - call 1 minute early to the phone number, and visit both websites at exactly 3. There is a chance those website won't be able to hand the load, and only those on the phone will get the tickets.

Is it even worth trying?

	<TEXT> I definately got a bit lucky. I got an internship for the team I currently work for, because I family friend of mine got me the interview (but not the job). After the summer they offered me a position for $75k. I'm not sure if my family friend had something to do with the salary, as it's corporate, and it's not like he can just throw money at me.

Anyway I have friends straight out of college who went to Seattle and got $100k, so $60-$70k sounds reasonable. Have you tried looking at Motorolla in the burbs? Boeing? CME? I don't know if the BA degree would hold you back after 5 years, but probably did when you first got a job.

As for helping you out, I only know of a position for a serious Oracle DB expert.  </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2015-04-17 22:10:18 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi all!

I was wondering what is the best way to do the following (on Windows)

I have 4 .twb files (Tableau workbook - basically xml). Sometimes I will make changes to one workbook, and I want to copy the changes over the the other 3. The only difference between the workbooks is that they have different connection information. So really there is only a one line difference.

    connection authentication = myAuth schema='mySchema'

and so on. This line is different in each file, but everything else is the same.

How would I go about propagating all the changes from the first xml file to all four files - taking into account that the one particular line should not change for each file? 

Familiar with Java, so is there a simple library that can do this? Or maybe there is some script (scripting in windows?) I can write? I have Cmder, so maybe there is some utility for that I could use. Just need some direction. </TEXT>
