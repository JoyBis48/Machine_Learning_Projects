	<TEXT> You are ignoring the fact that going west would be a huge waist of energy to get to pretty much the same place.  Plus going into a polar orbit would be a big waist of energy because you would not be able to take advantage of any of the energy you used to get to LEO because you would be making a 90 degree plane change to start your burn to Mars.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This would possibly be kind of correct, if you were launching direct to Mars, but it is most likely they will launch to LEO and then to Mars.  But even direct to Mars you would still gain some energy by launching closer to the equator.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think this is because west coast launches are

1. At a higher latitude than the east coach making the launches less efficient (You need a bigger rocket to get the same mass to the same place.).
2. Need to depart over the pacific ocean for range safety which is perfect for polar launches, but not so great for anything trying to go into LEO, or LEO transfer to Mars because now you are overflying land and people.  

idk these are my best guesses why the west coast tends to be less popular.  Anybody knows more please tell me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> But the problem with this logic is it assumes people who vote know the issues and people who don't don't.  Right now there are plenty of people that vote that have no idea about any of the issues they just vote because the heard a comercial, or thats what the party is said to do.  You cant pick and choose who votes, and in my opinion I think requiring you to vote might influence some of those less informed people to actually pay attention and understand the issues a little better. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think the big thing here i when teaching students they need to start off learning how to use the less intuitive instruments like the VOR just as with most things in flying it is important not to get overly dependent on one thing.  The problem with the GPS is it is so easy especially for beginners to become over reliant on what the GPS says.  If the GPS were to cut out they would be completely lost.  That is why it is important to not over rely on the GPS, not because it is not a good and effective tool, but because it can make you a worse pilot in terms of ability if you let it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It is not necessarily the people fault for believing it.  Most people are not that into space stuff, and would not be able to tell the difference between a legitimate organization like NASA and a bogus one like Mars One.  It is really the media's fault.  It would have taken 20 minutes of research to figure out Mars One was sketchy at best and more likely a scam.  But as usual these days.  it seems like the media did zero research before publishing exactly what Mars One told them.  And they wonder why people are not bothering to watch anymore. </TEXT>

Mars One = We will have colonists on mars in 10 years.  No real explanation how.

SpaceX = We are currently working on developing cheaper reusable rocket technology, as well as a larger more capable rocket that will be able to go to mars.  If everything keeps going well we will be looking at developing a more firm Mars plan in a few years.

Huge difference, although the media wont really care. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yea thats how I feel, it is so refreshing to see the progress being made, and after years of getting used to the leisurely to snail pase of NASA's R D, it is amazing and almost takes your breath away to see how fast SpaceX is developing new technology.  

Don't get me wrong, I love NASA, they are doing a lot of cool stuff, like [STEREO A and B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STEREO) (Where all our cool sun pictures come from), [Opportunity Rover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_\(rover\)), [Curiosity Rover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curiosity_\(rover\)), [Dawn Ceres mission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dawn_\(spacecraft\)), [Messenger Mercury mission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MESSENGER), [Cassini Saturn Mission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassini%E2%80%93Huygens), [Juno Jupiter Mission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juno_\(spacecraft\)), and the big one coming up in only a couple months, [New Horizons Pluto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Horizons)!!! :D  and those are just the main active missions, there are tons that have come and gone in the last 5 years.   

But I feel like as of late they have been progressively been getting more and more starved for cash, and politics has been really affecting their ability to get things accomplished.  I hope that SpaceX pushing the limits will indirectly help NASA get out of the funk its in. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What do you mean?  I feel like bill gates made some huge revolutions in the technology market.  I feel like microsoft even though it is kind of clunky was the bridge between computers in the early 90's and the computer we have today.

Computers early 90s = No internet doesn't do much.

Computers today = internet, google earth, tablet computers, smartphones, indirectly the Ipod, and basically every other personal electronic.

Plus in the 90's computers were not that common and internet looked like a middle schooler made all the web pages.  Today virtually every household has a computer, and the internet is the place it is today.

I would say he had a huge impact.

	<TEXT> Hello I came across [this 1973 Beetle](http://auto.mercadolibre.com.ec/MEC-406684146-volkswagen-escarabajo-1973-_JM) here in Ecuador.  I have been tossing around the idea of buying the car and driving it back to the USA as an awesome road trip, and also because it seems like a great deal.  

I am wondering what I am going to have to do to legally buy this car in Ecuador so that I can drive it on this road trip?  I am an American on a student visa if that affects anything.

I also found an excellent website detailing the logistics of the road trip part of the journey. http://wikioverland.org/Pan_American_Highway

I have been tossing around the idea of buying the car and driving it back to the USA as an awesome road trip, and also because it seems like a great deal.  

I wanted to know if anyone has any experience "importing" a classic beetle like this what kind of paper work will be necessary at the border?  Are there any issues I might not anticipate?  

I am mostly concerned with the logistic issues of getting it into the US and having it be street legal.

They are getting this model glider up to some pretty ridiculous speeds, how are they doing it?  and what kind of maneuver are they flying?  its just hard to understand where the energy is coming from to accelerate the plane like this.  I understand it has to do with the way the wind is hitting the ridge, but i don't get what it is that is actually happening. </TEXT>

/u/terrymr brings up some good points, and I was wondering what people here thought?  I was not aware of the FAA ruling mentioned in the last post.

Please help resolve this dispute.
