	<TEXT> NPR interviewed Jules Feiffer yesterday and he said the following: 

"Well, I've had endless acts because I ran out of steam on one thing, because life happened on another thing, and I developed a resourcefulness ... where I would just look around for some other way to do what I wanted to do. If it happens too fast, you don't build these, what I used to call these "rejection deltoids," where you are so used to being hit in the face that you just get up again automatically. The kids who were successful in high school from the beginning didn't know how to do that. So they would take a couple of slaps and they'd go into their father's business."

We all need to learn to cope when life slaps us around. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Was on Saturday morning, have to admit that Signal 30 is one of my favorite Mad Men episodes. So much packed into that episode. Also, for some reason, I really like TV episodes directed by actors. Slattery kept that episode tight. As an aside recommend the "Walter Taffet" episode of The Americans, superbly directed by Noah Emmerich. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Just wanted to say I really enjoy the show. As someone who has always had an interest in the history of Colonial America and the Revolution it's been frustrating how little play the Revolution has had in popular culture. I know at one point, there were more movies about the French and Indian War than about the Revolution - I guess the turn (no pun intended) came with Mel Gibson's Patriot. Now, in the Fall I have Sleepy Hollow and it's fun with the Revolution and then in the Spring I get the more serious, but still entertaining, Turn. </TEXT>
