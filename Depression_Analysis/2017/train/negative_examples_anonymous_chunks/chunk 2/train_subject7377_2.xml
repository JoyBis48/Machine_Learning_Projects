Edit to add story: one girl, about 15 years old, asked him what subjects she needed to do do become a nurse, he told her to just do easy subjects because "let's face it, you're not bright enough to be a nurse" 

She's currently in uni studying to be a nurse    </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As a student with adhd and depression things were generally a struggle. 

I was falling behind in one subject, but one weekend I was determined not to fail and spent all my energy working on and finishing two assignments. It was hard, but I did it and I was really proud of myself. I handed the assignments up on the Monday. 

 After a week or so, I hadn't got any response from the teacher so I asked him if he'd marked them yet. He said:

"I haven't looked, I'm not wasting my time because I don't know if it's worth it" 

Crushing. It's been 10 years since he said that and it still brings me to tears.  </TEXT>

Maybe try a different doctor, some are insensitive, some are really good, I learned this though experience, it took me about 5 doctors until I found one that actually cared about me. You might be able to ask others from your area (online?) if they can recommend someone really good for you to see. 

Medical professionals aren't anything to be scared of, they really can help. please try everything, don't give up.

Suicide is not your only option.

Please seek professional help, you shouldn't have to live in fear and you shouldn't have to think that killing yourself is the only way to fix it.

	<TEXT> In South Australia hand raised kangaroos can not be released into the wild and males must be desexed. I dont know the laws in the other states.

They are loving animals, and make great companions but not great pets, they have poor immune systems and can die suddenly without presenting any signs of illness, so it can be difficult to treat them for illnesses, they cause a lot of heartbreak, my friends who care for kangaroos probably lose two to everyone one that lives, it doesnt get easier, it's awful every time. They also bite (HARD) a lot, and kick and can't be toilet trained or anything, and need a lot of space.  </TEXT>

As an Australian, I never learned much about the way aborigines were treated after European settlement until I started university. At school it was all "they do dot paintings and use boomerangs". In uni I learned about the massacres, raping, stolen generations, them being classed as fauna, so many horrors.

that's a lot of info, I don't understand much of it, but I will do some research based on what you've told me. and I'm currently downloading Stellarium, which looks pretty neat and might keep me up all night. 

I've edited my original post to include some photos. 

As I'm new to telescope use, honestly, just looking at the moon is exciting, but knowing there is so much more to see... I want to be able to see it. 

I'd happily save up to buy a new telescope, but because this one was my papas, I want to be able to use it but make it better.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My grandfather was a keen amateur astronomer, and owned a few telescopes, he passed a few years ago but only recently has one of his telescopes been found (no idea where the others are/ if they still work)

I know absolutely nothing about telescopes, but am interested in astronomy. 
the label on the telescope reads:

 Denkar Astronomical Reflection Telescope

D- 3" F=600mm 

coated optics

and the bit you look through says "H 20mm"

what does this all mean? I set it up last night and got a good look at the moon, but viewing stars/ planets etc is no better than with a naked eye. 

Are they any ways to increase its power? additional thingys or whatsits? 

Or would it be cheaper to just go out and buy a whole new telescope to get better viewing? 

thank you

Edit: "More recently, consecutive reviews of the state of knowledge on the management of kangaroos
have failed to correlate kangaroo control to meaningful damage mitigation to pastoral properties or
the landscape in general (Olsen and Low; Olsen and Braysher; Herbert and Elzer)."

and

"[t]he main reason
an industry is approved is almost certainly because of the extent to which kangaroos are regarded as
a pest (Pople and Grigg). It is this construction of the kangaroo as a pest that has facilitated the
growth of the kangaroo industry, yet the view is based on ignorance, mistaken assumptions, and the
influence of vested interests in current practices."

	<TEXT> Mine is a pretty boring story, but still confuses me about 3 years later. 
I was driving with my mum from one sisters house to the other sisters house, about a 40 minute drive. 
When we got to our destination, I went to the toilet, saw I'd pooped my pants a little...

No idea how it happened, didn't feel it happening, didn't feel the need to poop. Hasn't happened since, luckily.

	<TEXT> I also pick, mostly when I am stressed/upset/angry etc. I used to have to put bandages around my finger tips because I would pick at the skin around them until it became too painful to use my fingers. 

Also, my cousin who also has ADHD used to pull out hairs one at a time, mostly her leg hair and eyelashes. she also picked at pimples a lot when she was a teen. 

I still do pick at my fingers from time to time, but I used to do it without even realising, I somehow became more conscious of it, and would be able to stop myself before I caused myself pain, just by focusing on what I was doing and asking myself what it was achieving, why was I doing it, should I keep doing it or should I stop. It doesnt sound like much but its helped. 

I have also read that having something to fidget with helps, although I haven't tried.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not really obscure, but not common I guess... I have worked at grain silos, it was really very satisfying work, hard and tiring but fun also. 

My favourite thing was when the silos were being emptied and I got to climb inside and sweep out the remainder... even though it was like 40 degrees celsius and difficult to breath with all the dust. satisfying. 

Also involved a lot of draining of sludge after rain, picking dead animals out of the grain, sweeping, admiring views, imagining how if during a zombie apocalypse, the silos would be a great place to hide out..etc. </TEXT>

Hopefully what she said was just out of grief and shock and not a serious threat of suicide. 

I obviously don't know the whole story, but from her point of view (I am guessing) you've taken away a whole future she was anticipating and now she has to start all over...

	<TEXT> I feel exactly the same a lot of the time, I do have depression also, and if I forget my medication for that these feelings intensify. As someone has suggested, maybe get checked out for depression.

Although, I do feel like these thoughts, as depressing as they can be, are not necessarily the result of depression.

I try to not have these thoughts as a negative thing, but rather as a positive. Use them to inspire me to work through the dullness of general life while planning on doing more exciting things later. Eg. having a boring job now will give me the money I need to travel later. 

I would love to move to the country (overseas maybe) and set up a self sustaining property to live on one day. 

How about we put together all our money and resources and buy a tropical island! who's with me?! </TEXT>
