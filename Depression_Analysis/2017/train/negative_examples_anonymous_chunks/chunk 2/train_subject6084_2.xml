To get to 9261 cubic meters the tennis court would need to be filled to a depth of 9251 / 261 = 35.48 **meters**. Ahah! the old metric vs. imperial mistake strikes again. (edit: formatting and tldr)

The website and their [twitter feed](https://twitter.com/spaceplanes/) haven't been updated since 2011, shortly after the launch. If planes were really found a long way away, Samsung would be publicizing the bejeezus out of this!

Since chloroplasts are responsible for photosynthesis, you would think that in this species, which has literally never seen the light of day, the chloroplast genome would have been lost over time. However, Rhizanthalla still retains a tiny number (37) of genes in its plastid genome, suggesting that chloroplasts have functions beyond that of photosynthesis.
