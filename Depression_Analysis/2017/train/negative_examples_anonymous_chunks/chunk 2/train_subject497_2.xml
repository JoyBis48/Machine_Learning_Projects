	<TEXT> Oh I know exactly what you mean!
Some people do that to me sometimes, too. "Acting above me" as you described it. I actually think that's quite disrespectful to treat someones feelings this way, since they are what they are and there's always a reason why they are there. They are part of who you are and I think, no one should laugh at you. I also think, that this is not a good way to make somebody trust you. (Don't know if that makes sense outside of my head.)

When you play along, do you sometimes also think, that people think you're kind of stupid or silly things like that? 

There's no need to be sorry. :) Everything's fine. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes, I also think it should be used a little bit cautiously. :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you so much for sharing your opinion!
I agree that it takes not that much to be plain sarcastic, but more to put sarcasm sophisticatedly to use.
Overall I still think, "plain sarcasm" shouldn't be taken too seriously, when it's not used in a harming way. </TEXT>
