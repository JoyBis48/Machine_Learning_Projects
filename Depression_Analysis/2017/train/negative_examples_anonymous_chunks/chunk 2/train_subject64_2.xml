Is it really a challenge to understand that continuous bombings and civilian-killing assaults over many years, in many Muslim countries, will generate the same desire for aggression and vengeance against the US?

	<TEXT> The reason for the silence about such matters, and the reason commentary of this sort sparks such anger and hostility, is two-fold: first, the US likes to think of terror as something only "others" engage in, not itself, and more so; second, supporters of Barack Obama, the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize laureate, simply do not want to think about him as someone who orders attacks on those rescuing his victims or funeral attendees gathered to mourn them.

That, however, is precisely what he is, as this mountain of evidence conclusively establishes.

The Pacific Fleet commander Admiral Nimitz agreed: "The Japanese had, in fact, already sued for peace. The atomic bomb played no decisive part, from a purely military point of view, in their defeat." Admiral Leahy, President Truman's Chief of Staff, concurred: the atomic attacks were "of no material assistance in our war against Japan. The Japanese were already ready to surrender" </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The military has not tortured anyone legally, you are thinking about the CIA.

So, I guess you're saying the CIA is and has always been running Bagram Prison, Gitmo and Abu Ghraib where torture was routine? And, I don't think it was the CIA who tortured the Afghan taxi driver to death in the documentary *[Taxi To The Dark Side](http://topdocumentaryfilms.com/taxi-to-the-dark-side/)*.

President Roosevelt ordered the bombing of Japan

Actually, it was Truman, not the deceased Roosevelt, who ordered the destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

Japan (who was far from defeated).

Then I guess you [disagree with Gen. Eisenhower](http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Dwight_D._Eisenhower) who said about Truman's decision to drop the bombs:  "I was against it on two counts. **First, the Japanese were ready to surrender**, and it wasn't necessary to hit them with that awful thing. Second, I hated to see our country be the first to use such a weapon."

[Admiral Leahy](http://www.doug-long.com/quotes.htm): "It is my opinion that the use of this barbarous weapon at Hiroshima and Nagasaki was of no material assistance in our war against Japan. **The Japanese were already defeated** and ready to surrender because of the effective sea blockade and the successful bombing with conventional weapons."

[Gen. MacArthur](http://www.doug-long.com/quotes.htm): [MacArthur] replied that he saw **no military justification for the dropping of the bomb**. The war might have ended weeks earlier, he said, if the United States had agreed, as it later did anyway, to the retention of the institution of the emperor."

hatred of the military

I hate pointless mass killing and destruction.  Unfortunately, the U.S. military is an eager participant in both of these activities.  The U.S. military does not protect freedom, it endangers it. If I'm wrong, tell me how I am more free today than I was prior to 9/11 or the Iraq War.

	<TEXT> Sorry, but the U.S. military does what most people would consider "abhorrent" things every day.  You routinely attack countries who do not threaten America nor ever could, you've killed literally millions of people in unnecessary foreign conflicts around the globe, you have tortured and continue to torture helpless individuals at secret prisons at the behest of the President, and, to top that off, you dropped city-destroying nuclear bombs on a nation that was already defeated in WWII.  Look at your real history, not the fanciful mythology you've been brainwashed with, and my guess is that a military acting on its own won't seem like such a far-fetched idea.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Why don't you ask Indonesia or Ethiopia how well off they would be without the US military?

Huh?  I've never heard that our military saved Ethiopia and Indonesia.  You'll have to educate me on that one.

yes we do fight..we do it well.

This just isn't borne out by the facts.  The U.S. military hasn't won a war since WW2.  It lost in Iraq and will lose in Afghanistan.  There is a difference between sowing destruction and death and victory.

criticize the way those liberties are provided

Liberties are natural rights.  Govt doesn't provide liberty.  Govt can only reduce or destroy liberty.

Better men than you or I have died to give you liberty and while criticism is the duty of all in a democracy

U.S. military personnel do not die to preserve liberty or democracy and haven't since (arguably) the American Revolution.  In fact, their actions abroad only serve to reduce liberty and democracy at home (see the TSA and our pointless elections).   They die normally to preserve the financial interests of certain elite groups such as the oil industry or the military-industrial-Congressional complex.  If you don't believe me, then just read [*War is a Racket* by Smedley Butler](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_is_a_Racket).

We *create* disasters (see Iraq, Pakistan, Somalia, Yemen, Afghanistan, etc.), we don't stop them.  The world w/b a much safer place were we to bring our military back to our shores and drastically reduce the size of our forces.

If we didn't have those bases half the world would've fallen apart because we couldn't get to them fast enough.

	<TEXT> name one country that we have annexed or taken in the last 50 year.

We tried to annex Iraq (remember the 100s of bases George W. Bush wanted?) and we're trying to continue our "enduring presence" in Afghanistan.  We still occupy Guam, Puerto Rico, Hawaii, Japan, Germany, Italy, England, Djibouti and God knows how many other countries.

I have traveled extensively in many countries and have never seen any place where the presence of the U.S. military has had a positive effect.  Of course, nearly every country has benefited from American innovcation and technology, but this would have occured independently from American occupation and bombing.

places where American influence has a been such a good thing

This argument has been used by every imperial power in the last 150 years.  Ignore the trail of destruction, look, they now have basketball courts and flush toilets! Whatever "good" America may have done, is it really worth the piles of corpses we leave behind? </TEXT>

Its a shame. The important issue is [what] the two candidates seem to agree on. They dont really disagree with militarism overseas, they dont disagree with the Federal Reserve system and the bailouts, and they dont disagree on basically whether the role of federal government is wealth redistribution through welfare. So instead, theyre talking about tax returns and that to me is so disappointing, he said. Its all a charade, I think its all contrived to not have a debate. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Rand wants to eliminate tax "loopholes."  This is the equivalent of raising taxes and Ron Paul has said as much.

Rand wants more *govt* spending on infrastructure.  This is exactly what Obama advocated when rallying support for his $800 billion "stimulus" program.  And nowhere in the interview does Rand ever state that he wants to *decrease* govt spending of any kind.  Ron always brings up reducing spending, particularly overseas.

Rand wants to make sure the behemoth and unconstitutional govt programs Social Security and Medicare are around for another 75 years.  Whenever Ron is asked about these programs, he always states that we need to transition out of them, not keep them around for another century.

And BTW, no one likes a tattletale.
