	<TEXT> Sucks about Anakin but Hayden's Vader was always a little bitch amirite? And Ryan Dunn was a genuinely cool guy. Met him at SEMA Show in Vegas outside on a smoke break and mentioned to him my gf (now wife) were fans of CKY (pre-jackass) and she was good friends with his cousin. He told me to call her up and he talked with her for a few minutes, told her to say hi to his cousin and to make sure we come by at their next reunion coming up. Then we just talked about cars and what we saw at the show. He died I think sometime the next year and was genuinely sad. Plus he was vilified in the media for the crash. Sucked all the way around. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have even heard that his essay series on "The International Jew: The World's Foremost Problem" actually inspired Hitler to take action and create what he called "The Final Solution" with the extermination camps. It's quite insane. But how about that new Ford GT EH?! </TEXT>
