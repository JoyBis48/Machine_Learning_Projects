	<TEXT> 2015 is finally the year where Android users can choose between premium feeling Android devices with materials that include: glass, metal or leather. No more cheap plasticky-feeling flagship devices.

That said, what annoys me about Sony is that it launches its devices in a weird cycle like September. This means it will end up with an obsolete chip like Snapdragon 810 or 808, when 820 could arrive in devices in November. And this has happened more than once with the Z-series. Quite frustrating. 

Sony should be planning its devices according to when a next-generation chip comes out. Samsung, HTC and LG always do that. </TEXT>

What you need to do is use something like Signal for iOS or Redphone/Textsecure for Android. Also, if you root the phone you can install the SnoopSnitch app (Android) to protect yourself against fake cell towers they have installed to capture radio signals and intercept them. However, rooting also invites easier hacking on your phone, so it might be best you don't know that. Just use the apps I mentioned and careful what you say over the carriers' networks. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's also funny how so far they've been saying that they "can't" upgrade their networks any faster. And as soon as Google Fiber gets in  some place, suddenly they all upgrade by 2x, 3x, or even 6x their speeds - for free.

Huh, go figure. So it was possible to upgrade the networks and give customers much better Internet after all!

That said, I still believe they will be using shenanigans, and even if your connection on one of these ISPs is 200 Mbps, Netflix will probably still be throttled, or you'll get a much lower average speed most of the time. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I actually have no problem with you not using PGP, especially if your method is "better" than PGP (while still remaining end-to-end and having client-side encryption). I just want you to make it as clear as possible how it works.

Even for ProtonMail which has gotten a lot of publicity I'm still not sure it uses proper end-to-end encryption (I think it's server-side). But I'm not completely sure either way because they don't make it too easy to figure it out (perhaps on purpose in their case). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Tutanota is interesting, however I think they are making it *really hard* to figure out how they are encrypting their stuff. You have to scour through 50 small-font FAQ questions on a third party site where each has to open in a new window, and after you do manage to find the relevant questions 30 minutes later you're still not 100% sure you understood how they are doing it.

At the end, the best I could get is that it's *not* using PGP but some kind of custom RSA/AES based "end to end" encryption (?!).

Compare that to Whiteout, where you get a pretty good idea of how it works from a single page:

https://whiteout.io/technology.html

Also, any reason why tutanota.de gets a green HTTPS icon, but tutanota.com doesn't? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's hard to tell for now, really. I would say it won't be until at least Android M or even N, when we can really answer this question.

Stuff like ART or the Material Design didn't rise under Pichai, but Rubin. They were both 2-3 year old projects when Lollipop was announced.

If anything, Pichai is *limiting* Android, but not *allowing* the developers to turn it into a "desktop OS" as well and *really* compete against Windows, just like they used Android to create Android Auto, Android Wear and Android TV - all having quite different interfaces than the phone version of Android. They could do the same with "Android PC". 

Just add a taskbar, multi-window support and encourage developers to optimize their apps for the desktop and OEMs to put it on laptops/hybrid devices. Why do that through the "backdoor" with the browser-based Chrome OS, one app at a time? (Android apps don't work *automatically* on Chrome OS). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> uBlock is definitely the best out there now. However, I sometimes have issues with it, and I have to press unblock on certain pages. So they still need to work on the kinks. But that's expected considering it's not even version 1.0.

I'd also like to see a much more intuitive interface for unblocking certain elements. I don't understand what all the pluses and minuses mean there. It would be better if it would be marked what's allowed with a green icon and with red what isn't.

I've heard 2 of the main developers (including its creator) left the project. But I assume something as popular as uBlock already has a big enough community to support its future development.

1) Google's Fiber business is *sustainable* (if only 1% of the cable customers subscribe to Google Fiber in all cities, Google Fiber will fail, and we'll lose the main incentive for Comcast/TWC/AT T to keep upgrading).

2) Google Fiber continues to *expand* in other cities as well, so  the competition increases in those places, too, not just in some places.

Besides, it's very likely Google Fiber will either have the faster speed, lower price, unlimited bandwidth, or a better "constant speed" than these guys anyway, no matter what they're promising now. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  we're about to see much slower progress than we used to

Moore's Law is irrelevant in the grand scheme of things. The rate of progress will continue with or without "Moore's Law" (which specifically states that the number of transistors per die area will double every 18 months).

Here's an example to understand what Moore's Law is and isn't. Let's say we come up with a new type of transistor, like one based on graphene, and once we reach the physical limits for the size of tranzistors (close to an atom's size), we'll use something like graphene transistors to *increase frequency* every 18 months or whatever. Then, even though we won't have a "doubling of the number of transistors per die area" every 18 months anymore (so no more Moore's Law), we'd still have this "doubling of frequency" every 18 months (just an example). The point is we'd *still* have a good rate of progress even without Moore's Law. And that rate of progress would once again confirm the law of accelerated returns (even if we find another name of the "law of doubling frequency" - that would be just a *niche* within the law of accelerated returns). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It does remind me of this:

 The IPSEC standards also mandated support for the "null"
     encryption option (plaintext hiding in supposedly-encrypted
     packets), for 56-bit Single DES, and for the use of a 768-bit
     Diffie-Hellman group, all of which are insecure and each of which
     renders the protocol subject to downgrade attacks.

https://www.mail-archive.com/cryptography@metzdowd.com/msg12325.html

As we've seen with the recent SSL3 attack, it's sometimes easier to break an encryption scheme if you can downgrade it to weaker algorithms. It helps if you make the whole protocol overly complex as well to the point where it's *easy to mess up*. That sounds like a very sound strategy for the NSA to use within standards groups while still preserving "plausible deniability" and being relatively subtle about it. </TEXT>

But if we're talking about say a single PC chip, Moore's Law as you "understand it" is absolutely NOT true anymore. The doubling of transistors per die area *is*, but not the "doubling in performance" every 18 months.

	<TEXT> Microsoft puts a "lot of effort" into Android because it has no choice. As a platform, Android is bigger than Windows now (yes, you read that right).

Windows phones and tablet market share on the other hand are in low single digits market share.

And just like Microsoft, Google *also* builds apps and such for the desktop Windows platform - why? Because it wants to? No. Because it *has to*, since the Windows platform is still huge on the desktop.

None of them are doing it out of the goodness of their own hearts. That's just PR bullshit that intends to make Microsoft look good.

Apple doesn't give a f%#k because it makes 98% of its money from hardware. Both Google and Microsoft make their money from services and software. Of course Microsoft would want to build an Office app for Android. If Office is not popular on Android, then something else would become popular for soon to be 2 billion users. If it makes its app on Android, then Office still has a chance of remaining popular.

Do you understand now that it has nothing to do with "being a good guy" or being selfless?! If Microsoft was a good guy they'd stop harassing OEMs with bogus patents and extorting billions a year from them. But guess what? Microsoft only cares about what makes them money. And in this case, it's Android. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Interesting about DNSChain, I haven't seen that.

Lavaboom seems to have experienced some issues lately, including a DDoS attack and losing a developer:

https://twitter.com/LavaboomHQ

Peerio as well as miniLock are open source:

https://github.com/PeerioTechnologies/peerio-client

https://github.com/kaepora/miniLock

Audit of miniLock (although in this case an audit of Peerio itself would be preferable): https://cure53.de/pentest-report_minilock.pdf

I think what isn't open source about Peerio is basically the storage service. Their monetization model seems to be like: "Allow users to encrypt end to end with native clients, but they can store those encrypted files on our servers for easy access/transmission - 1GB free, after that you pay". So in that way it's kind of like Spideroak, except you can actually "communicate" through an e-mail like interface with Peerio.

Peerio without a "third-party" storage service is essentially miniLock (encrypt and send the file over whatever medium you want). </TEXT>

But this still ends up being bad for Intel in the long term, as 1) the gov may or may not continue to use Intel for DoE supercomputers in the future, and it may just be a one-time deal, while in China it would've been a longer-term deal, and 2) China will still end up making a competitor.

Also, this way the US gov screwed Nvidia, too, as it would've been Nvidia or possibly AMD the one to get this contract (as it did the last time). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> More competition and fewer opportunities for Intel to abuse its monopoly power in PCs and server markets by transferring the profits there to its mobile chips, so it can sell them under-cost to steal market share from ARM.

If the only way for you to be in a certain market and competitive, is to sell chips at 1/4 of their regular price, by subsidizing 75% of it, then you don't deserve to be in that market, let alone have any chance of "conquering" that market in this way. Because it just means that as soon as they "conquer" it and most ARM chip makers are dead, they'll go back to selling for 100% of the price again. So the consumer gets screwed. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Also, Alibaba is already building datacenters in the US. So now you'll have Chinese companies offering online services to Americans, and then the Chinese government gets to access the data on those American users. 

What if a Chinese company builds the next Facebook? Or Instagram? Or big chat app?

This is not even an argument that I'm making alone. Here's what a former NSA chief said about this just [last week](http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/dont-let-america-be-boxed-in-by-its-own-computers/2015/04/02/30742192-cc04-11e4-8a46-b1dc9be5a8ff_story.html):

 In a perverse way, as the saying goes, what goes around comes around. Precedents we set will be followed  or exploited  by others in an economic system that becomes more globalized and hence more interdependent by the day. Already others point to U.S. activities to justify their own, often nefarious, efforts. Witness the Chinese trying to create moral and legal equivalency between legitimate U.S. intelligence and their massive theft of intellectual property, or their placement of newly minted restrictions on U.S. IT firms. One wonders what the Russias and Chinas of the world will demand if U.S.-based firms are forbidden to create encryption schemes inaccessible to themselves or the government. Beyond the realm of speculation, the Chinese company Alibaba has announced plans to open a cloud data center in the United States. **How will we feel when a Chinese court orders Alibaba to send data on Americans back to China, citing our own behavior as justification?**

 These are serious, long-term questions requiring serious, strategic answers. Possible second- and third-order effects  such as **generating a stampede toward data localization or a Balkanized Internet**  need to be considered alongside a still-important calculus based on more transient, tactical advantage.

A Balkanized Internet will hurt the US the *most* since it's the US that has the most to gain from the Internet right now, yet it's the US directly or indirectly pushing for that Internet to become much more limited, just like it has tried to limit the computation capabilities of its own companies in the past so other countries can't have access to them (more about this in the article as well). </TEXT>

For the 2nd amendment, neither Democrats not Republicans dare to do much to restrict it - even though I believe the way most 2nd amendment defenders understand it is *wrong*. 

The 2nd amendment talks about a *regulated militia's* right to bear arms - not everyone's. It's more like how they gave weapons to militia in Mexico to fight against the cartels, and registered them as militia. It's not about everyone and their grandmother having the right to own a gun. </TEXT>

Just use "clean" PCs and phones when passing the border. Download your stuff later when you cross the border. It goes without saying that you shouldn't be logged into your browser (where you might also have tons of other login credentials saved).

And by clean PC I don't necessarily mean a *formatted* PC or phone. Remember that stuff can be easily recovered (if they want to go through that trouble), unless you've always used encryption on your hard drives. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Here's what I find ridiculous about prosecutor charges/plea bargains.

Let's imagine the prosecutor charges Aaron Swartz with 35 years in prison. But then the prosecutor wants a plea bargain that would put Aaron in prison for *only 2 years*. But let's not imagine, because that *actually happened*.

So which is it? Is he a terrible danger to society that deserves 35 years in prison - or is it a relatively minor offense that should only get 2 years?

In reality, it's neither. Because for all intents and purposes Aaron Swartz was "innocent", innocent in the *spirit of the law* sense, not in the "everybody commits 3 felonies a day" *letter of the law* sense.

But prosecutors can abuse this plea bargain power and get even innocent people to accept prison time that only seems *small* in comparison to the initial exaggerated charge. In reality, for someone innocent, even that is too small - but they have may no choice, and would rather take "only 1/15th" of the initial prison time.

Back to the point, I think the jury would start *cutting through the bullshit*, and if he's indeed dangerous and a real criminal, then he will get maybe not 35 years that the prosecutor initially asks, but 20 years. On the other hand, if he's dangerous, but the prosecutor once a "sure-fire" 2 years in prison "win", then again the jury will stop that from happening.

If the whole thing is bullshit, and the guy is innocent, then the jury may save him. I think that would be a lot closer to "real justice" (regardless of whether the guy is innocent or guilty) than leaving everything to the prosecutor. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The fact that when the Patriot Act was announced - just after 9/11 mind you - they said it's going to be used "against terrorism...and *drug crimes*" should've been a HUGE FUCKING RED FLAG!

So you're telling me that you're in a hurry to pass a "new" law that wants to prevent the kind of terrorist attacks that have just happened....and you took the time to introduce *drug crimes* in there, too?! What the fuck?

The aspect alone should've made everyone think that the Patriot Act  was just another way for the government to expand its powers and remove more rights from citizens.

Lo and behold, more than a decade later, the Patriot Act and "National Security" Letters are used in something like 97 percent of the cases for *drug crimes*, not for actual "national security" issues (and that's ignoring the fact that in many instances the feds just claim "national security" for no good reason). </TEXT>

So what we're seeing is basically a sort of Moore's Law for batteries, but instead of the performance "doubling every 2 years", it doubles every 10 years. 

Still not bad at all, and a rate of improvement far greater than what we've seen in gas-powered cars. If this rate of progress lasts for 2-3 decades, we could see batteries at a given mileage be 10x cheaper than they are today, or last 10x more at the same price point. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You're forgetting the keyboard isn't actually included. That will probably be another $130.  $630 is pretty pricey for a low-end notebook with mobile processor, with 64GB of storage and 2GB of RAM, no? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I see how it goes. So when Pentagon officials or other elites use strong encryption, then that's fine. But when the plebs use it, then they must be pedophiles. Because we all know the elites couldn't possibly also be [pedophiles](https://news.vice.com/article/uk-police-investigating-five-alleged-pedophile-rings-involving-highly-influential-politicians). 

As for Silent Circle - have they updated their warrant canary yet? Last I checked they made it sound as if they already received some kind of *secret* warrants to give user data. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Have you even tried to introduce them to Drive?

The problem with this is they will still run *Windows* and for tech illiterate people Chrome OS will still be far better.

Chrome OS is a much bigger advantage in simplicity than the disadvantage of not having Office and having to use Drive.

And doesn't Microsoft have online Office now? That should work on Chrome OS, no? Unless they're still requiring plugins for it like in the stone-age. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So Facebook's *future* is...Second Life?

I feel like we've "been there, done that", and it wasn't that great, except for a small number of people.

There are so many great things VR and therefore Oculus could do. Building another Second Life is not one of them, and it's actually *exactly* what I was afraid of when Facebook bought Oculus - that it would take it down this bad path. </TEXT>
