	<TEXT> If we were all defined by our extremists, I reckon we would be in quite a pickle. KKK members and white supremacists certainly aren't the norm in our faith, just like extremists aren't the norm in yours.

I was in Afghanistan. I have seen firsthand the difference between radicals, and everyday Muslims. I still do not understand why so many are so willing to propogate some kind of "new crusades". </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hello, Afghanistan veteran here.

I am curious to know whether you think the war/military intervention has made Iraq better or worse, from personal experience?

1. How has the country changed since Saddam's regime fell, in your personal experience?

2. How has U.S. intervention affected you personally?

3. What are your opinions about the war and the soldiers who fought it? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Some denominations continued using wine, and the producers of sacramental wine were able to get exemptions.

Other denominations who were at the head of the prohibitionist movement switched to using grape juice. One of the fellows who started Welch's grape juice company was a vehement advocate for teetotaling, and tried to advocate for grape juice being used at the communion table. 

That divide still exists today. Many of the more fundamentalist Christian denominations who advocate teetotalism use grape juice instead of wine at the Table. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> **OP**

1. I am in the Army. I work in a motorpool helping maintain trucks. 

2. I bring an old green stanley lunchbox with me to work everyday. It is usually filled with a bar of lava soap, moonpies or little debbie cakes, two sandwiches (usually bologna or salami on white bread), chips or a small green thermos of soup, and a can of coca-cola. I also bring a gallon jug of sweet tea that I consume throughout the work day and whatever book I am currently reading.  I get about an hour lunch break. I scrub my hands, sit down in my office, and eat at a back desk, taking my time.

3. I usually use my lunchbreak to either listen to a podcast (either *This American Life*, *How Stuff Works*, or *Planet Money*), or reading a bit of whatever book I am currently working on. After my break I am usually energized to finish the rest of the day (which tends to be long). </TEXT>

If it is a county wide thing, a crime involving several cities, or outside of city limits, the Sheriff will usually handle it. If it js a statewide thing, or something on state land, the troopers get it. 

That being said, there is a ton of cooperation between departments. There is also conflict. Sometimes Sheriff's and Deputies overstep their bounds in city limits, and vice versa. It is a more organic relationship.  </TEXT>

We are a hybrid of semi-free markets and government intervention. China, N. Korea etc are the same way. They started out totally communist.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I am a pretty staunch libertarian, strong advocate for decentralization, and near ancap. I have a few reservations though. Perhaps y'all could help me.

1. What happens to nukes in Ancapistan? Obviously worldwide anarchism is not going to happen overnight, so even if the U.S. becomes a voluntary society, Russia, China etc will still have powerful weapons, and might seek to take advantage of what they see as a vulnerable situation. How do we as a society of individuals protect ourselves against these weapons? Also, what happens to the nukes the U.S government owns once it disbands?

2. Along those lines, how does a voluntary society protect itself from a sadistic individual obtaining a WMD? Say someone gets the money and ability to buy a powerful weapon. How do we stop him from killing thousands?

3. If the U.S. government disbanded, do you not see it as likely that another nation would try to use coercive force to take over? How could we possibly arm ourselves well enough to prevent that without a professional military.


These are just a few of my reservations. I definitely think liberty wins, and that ancap ideals can be implemented over a small scale, but I have a really hard time seeing it as a large scale option... </TEXT>

I am an active duty soldier nearing the end of my enlistment. I am seriously considering the railroad as a post-military career. Maybe y'all can help me with some questions.

1. I am currently a shop supply specialist. I oversee the order of parts for the motorpool, schedule services, keep track of inventory etc. A lot of supply and maintenance management. How do these skills translate into railroading?

2. Are the hours as bad as I hear? Being in the military has gotten me used to long hours, being away from my family, but I have heard many horror stories about railroading. 

3. How are the benefits?

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> As the title says I am an avowed laissez faire capitalist libertarian looking to engage some socialists respectfully. I have some honest questions, I am not trying to argue or pick a fight, just looking for a civil conversation.

1. What do you think the biggest misconceptions are about socialism?

2. What is your opinion as a full socialist about mixed economies (like the U.S) where the market is neither totally free or totally socialist?

3. Do you see any difference between laissez faire capitalism and crony capitalism?

4. What books or media would you recommend to me so I can honestly understand the socialist perspective?

5. What would change in the U.S if it became a fully socialist country?

6. What things do people think would change in the U.S. if it were a socialist country, but would actually remain the same. 


Sorry to lump my questions all together, I did not know of a better way. 

Thanks! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 1. Did the TechnoCore remind anyone else of Asimov's MultiVac?

2. Did anyone else think Brawne Lamia came off sounding annoyingky similar to a 50's noir pulp-fiction detective character?

All in all it was a great book. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This sub is full of recommendations for *The Name of The Wind*. It's been on my TR list for a long time, but after hearing all the hype I moved it to the top of my list. I was very disappointed. Kvothe was really unbelievable for me. He was just too flawless. The magic system seemed heavily borrowed from Earth sea. I didn't hate it, I'm actually really interested to read the new book about Auri (the underthing was my favorite part) but the book only got three stars from me. </TEXT>
