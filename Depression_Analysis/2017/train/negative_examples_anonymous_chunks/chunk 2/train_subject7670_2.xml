	<TEXT> You know, as the story progressed I really started to enjoy Harper and Julia. I really liked the arc of those two characters, and how their own relationship with each other started to change. I started to look forward to writing their sections the most. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Wowie, there are some badass authors out there. I feel the need to give you a top ten list. But...I will force myself to answer your question: When I think of a favorite author, I actually think of Blake Crouch because I have yet to pick up a book of his and not like it. Simple as that. </TEXT>
