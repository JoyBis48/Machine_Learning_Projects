	<TEXT> I suppose IF in fact the statements are false he could. That is a big IF though. 
Also IDK if there is a warrant for the arrest of an adult is that considered open to public knowledge? I would think so; I'm not a lawyer though.

Edit many hours later, fyi:  ( yea from wiki:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_defamation_law)
"Defamation law in modern practice:
Defamation law in the United States is much less plaintiff-friendly than its counterparts in European and the Commonwealth countries, due to the enforcement of the First Amendment"....etc bla bla...
  "One defense is reporting or passing through information as a general information or warning of dangerous or emergent conditions, and intent to defame must be proven. Also, the truth of the allegedly defamatory statement will always negate the claim (whether because the plaintiff fails to meet his/her burden of proving falsity or because the defendant proves the statement to be true).[11]"

so you see? the burden of proof of innocence often appears to fall upon the plaintiff in these cases.  

"Libel is a method of defamation expressed by print, writing, pictures, signs, effigies, or any communication embodied in physical form that is injurious to a person's reputation, exposes a person to public hatred, contempt or ridicule, or injures a person in his/her business or profession." fromhttps://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/libel

I want to be real clear here that I am in no way standing up for a pedos nor anyone else's right to harm children. Nor am I presuming the perhaps defamed, originally accused (Joe if u lost track) man to be guilty.

	<TEXT> The entire story seems a fiasco! They seized Joe's computer based on his brother's say so? then...
 "For nearly six years, nothing happened. Its not clear why, but perhaps because the original detective retired in 2007.

The computer sat at the state police Computer Crimes Unit in Lansing without being forensically examined. A note in the file in 2007 shows state police couldnt find the search warrant or consent form to search it. By 2008, records show, state police were considering destroying the evidence after a review of the complaint showed issues over burden of proof" "

So for 6 years this accused pedo was allowed free reign!!! (on his upgraded computer no doubt). Outrageous.

The arresting the wrong guy part is the least of it almost, though I have to ask, if they thought  Dean was the man, they (thankfully as it turned out) allowed him to remain in a home with 4 children?  

ok brain is broken now, too much lack of logic for me in this story. </TEXT>

Though who the hell knows, maybe they both are innocent. Seems everything else was majorly botched, so I can't put a lot of stock in the supposed confession that the Billy Joe guy is purported to have made. This is one messed up story.  </TEXT>

None of the possibilities aside from perhaps #1 seem to make a lot of sense considering the effort.

There was a poppy nailed to the wall?   "Saunders said the tunnel appeared to be well-constructed and that there were still tools inside, along with a wheelbarrow and a pulley system, when it was found. Police also found a rosary and a Remembrance Day poppy nailed to a wall."  http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2015/02/25/388997201/toronto-police-try-to-uncover-riddle-of-mystery-tunnel

	<TEXT> When certain substances such as corticosteroids   opioids are introduced exogenously I believe the body decreases endogenous production in response over the course of time. 

Were we able to develop formulas for individualized optimum levels of various neurotransmitters, and introduce some sort of bio-sensor coupled with IDK, nanotechnology I suppose,  able to block/release the assorted neurotransmitters in response to the bio-sensors readings.. then we could potentially all be an emotionally stable, happy happy army I suppose. 

Sounds a lot like 'Brave New World' to me .

It is frightening to think of the extended lifespans of the 1% once the little issues regarding spinal cord connection are worked out.

	<TEXT> Yea I've seen similar situations where one among a group of irl friends  suddenly dies. It seems to sometimes spur others on to make improvements in their own world (I am thinking specifically of one young man that died of an overdose; not long after at least one of his good friends went sober, so yay to that). 
The online friends thing is slightly more difficult I thing in terms of mourning, although things like this happen: http://puu.sh/btytv.jpg  They are planting flowers in memory of a friend.

	<TEXT> Hi sorry if I have submitted wrong (hope not!)  

The original film dates from 1938, this version was released in 1942.

Film plot courtesy http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_Br...
Miss Carol (Diana Durrell) is an idealistic teacher in a remote one-room schoolhouse. A native of the Ozarks herself, she is determined to stop the practice of child marriage, in which older men marry teen or preteen girls. Her campaign raises the ire of some local men, led by Jake Bolby, who drag her into the woods one night with the intention of tarring and feathering her. Before they can do this, however, Angelo the dwarf and Mr. Colton arrive with a shotgun to save the day.

Following this, Jake Bolby comes across young Jennie Colton swimming naked. When her father dies, Bolby decides to take advantage of the opportunity to blackmail her mother into letting him marry the girl, threatening that otherwise he will see her hanged for murder. After he "courts" Jennie by giving her a doll, the two are married. It later turns out that this ceremony was illegal, as child marriage had been banned several days prior, but this point quickly becomes moot. Before Bolby can consummate the union, he is gunned down by Angelo. Jennie leaves his house with Freddie, and the movie ends. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have lost a couple of friends that I played with on a mmorpg.  It felt similar to losing rl friends:( 

I met the mother of a player ( I did not know that young man, but recognized his name when she used it as her email), and I felt such an immediate connection to her   to her loss, I think more so than had I not realized he was a player on that game. 

Internet mourning is a real thing.

Thank you for the reply, I was rather curious as to the question myself:)

	<TEXT> I think that the sort of 'magical thinking' of childhood extends a bit longer than most seem to believe.  
 
 That there is some sort of argument within the minds of semi-grown children as to whether "I wished my friend would die because I was mad, and she did, so it must be my fault' vs. " No that can't be correct, I didn't really want her to die   didn't hit her with that car". 

Just seems the magical thinking continuing must have some sort of contributing factors, be those drugs, isolation, wacko parents, idk.

ok just speculating here, pardon me. </TEXT>

 'Glad They Cleared Up That Mistake
February 15, 2015 by Hemant Mehta 

Boyd W. Thomas wrote a letter to the editor of the Lexington Dispatch (North Carolina) thats just gloriously weird. It begins like this:
God states that seven kings must come before the rise of the Antichrist. Revelations 17:10 says the seventh king will reign for a short amount of time. Is Barack Obama the seventh king?
I guess when the article ran, though, the headline said something like Is Obama the Antichrist? Which caused the editors to have to correct their mistake in an even more memorable way:
 *[here they duplicate the Correction as printed in the Dispatch, it made me chuckle]
So the headline is now accurate on the website. Even though the letter itself, which is the real problem, will never see a correction.
Because Murica.'

	<TEXT> arg ok I am adding this from wiki: 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Bell#Life_after_prison
Conviction[edit]
On 17 December 1968, at Newcastle Assizes, Norma Bell was acquitted but Mary Bell was convicted of manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility, the jury taking their lead from her diagnosis by court-appointed psychiatrists who described her as displaying "classic symptoms of psychopathy". The judge, Mr. Justice Cusack, described her as dangerous and said she posed a "very grave risk to other children". She was sentenced to be detained at Her Majesty's pleasure, effectively an indefinite sentence of imprisonment. She was initially sent to Red Bank secure unit in St. Helens, Lancashire  the same facility that would house Jon Venables, one of James Bulger's child killers, 25 years later.[1]

After her conviction, Bell was the focus of a great deal of attention from the British press and also from the German Stern magazine. Her mother repeatedly sold stories about her to the press and often gave reporters writings she claimed to be by her daughter. Bell herself made headlines when, in September 1977, she briefly absconded from Moor Court open prison, where she had been held since her transfer from a young offenders institution to an adult prison a year earlier. Her penalty for this was a loss of prison privileges for 28 days.[6]

For a time, Bell also lived in a girls' remand home at Cumberlow Lodge in South Norwood (in a house built by Victorian inventor William Stanley).[7][8]

Life after prison[edit]
In 1980, Bell, aged 23, was released from Askham Grange open prison, having served 12 years, and was granted anonymity (including a new name) allowing her to start a new life. Four years later she had a daughter, born on 25 May 1984; Bell's daughter did not know of her mother's past until Bell's location was discovered by reporters in 1998 and she and her mother had to leave their house with bed sheets over their heads.

Bell's daughter's anonymity was originally protected only until she reached the age of 18. However, on 21 May 2003, Bell won a High Court battle to have her own anonymity and that of her daughter extended for life. Any court order permanently protecting the identity of a convict in Britain is consequently sometimes known as a "Mary Bell order."

In 2009, it was reported that Bell had become a grandmother </TEXT>

	<TEXT> hmm. I tend to want to err on the side of the child.  I know there seem to be some that are born lacking the capacity to be empathetic.

I still hope that as a society we will take measures to ascertain the possible source of such horrifying behavior, and to remedy whatever may have been behind the fury   lack of control.

re the Mary Bell  case: http://www.theguardian.com/uk/1968/dec/18/ukcrime.childprotection
  "Dr Westbury's inquiries indicated that the matter was the responsibility of the health department of the Ministry of Social Security said the judge. But the department "require time to consider what they are to do and no specific time is indicated."

He continued: "It is an appalling thing that with a child as young as this one, one has to take into consideration such matters. I am not entirely unsympathetic but anxious as I am to do everything for her benefit, my primary duty is to protect other people.

"There is a very grave risk to other children if she is not closely watched and every conceivable step taken to see that she doesn't do again what she has been found guilty of. In the case of a child of this age, no question of imprisonment arises. I have power to order a sentence of detention and it seems to me that no other method of dealing with her in the circumstances is suitable."

Life detention, he said, did not mean that the person concerned was kept in custody indefinitely or for the rest of their natural lives. The position could be considered form time to time."
