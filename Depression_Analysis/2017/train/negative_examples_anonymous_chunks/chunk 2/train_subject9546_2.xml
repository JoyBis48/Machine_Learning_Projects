	<TEXT> But reasoning changes and they can very well change their minds on certain talents that they have previously said no to.  They can also bring in older guys like they have with Rhyno or Kendrick to give a little boost to the star power there and give these up and comers established wrestlers to work with. </TEXT>

You don't have to lose to someone to put them over.  Yes it can be done that way but it's not the only way.  But I don't expect you to take anything anyone says as legit unless they 100% agree with what you are saying so I guess I am wasting my time on a lost cause that is you. </TEXT>

Rusev had an extremely long undefeated streak and held the US title and is having matches with the top dog of the company.  That is thriving. </TEXT>
