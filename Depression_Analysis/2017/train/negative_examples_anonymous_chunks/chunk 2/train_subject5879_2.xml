	<TEXT> She hits a lot of asian stereotypes, but she sounds pretty narcissistic.

Keep in mind there are many different kinds of narcissism, for example my mother is a shy narcissist... Which is an oxymoron, but I cant describe it any other way.

The worst thing about narcissistic parents is that you need to get away from narcissists but youre supposed to stay close to your parents :/

I wish you luck. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Lets make a list of evil...

All their Laffy Taffy shall be yellow. Their audio when watching videos shall be .1seconds off. Mosquitoes shall bite them in awkward places. The shaving razor will cut them every time, no matter how careful the are. Nobody will talk to them at parties. Their shuffle shall always land on the same 10 songs. Telemarketers shall call every day. They will always get the 30 second ad on YouTube. AdBlock will not work for them. 500 ms of lag, no matter what. </TEXT>
