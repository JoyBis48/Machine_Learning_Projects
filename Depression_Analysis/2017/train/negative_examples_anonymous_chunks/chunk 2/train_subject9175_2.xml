	<TEXT> Heath Ledger slowly opens his eyes surrounded by machines and chemicals.

"What happened?" 

"Mr Ledger. You've been dead for fives years." says the scientist. "But, with the latest technology, we've been able to cheat death itself and raise you, like Lazarus, from your grave. We don't have long though. The process is only temporary."

"Oh god! Thank you! I'll have one more chance to hold my daughter. To say a proper goodbye to my family. I'll be able talk to Michelle. I always regretted how things ended between us. Thank you for this second chance!"

"I'm sorry Mr Ledger. There isn't much time and we need you to make another Batman movie."

The conclusion the films seems to be the exact opposite of what actually happened.

The Americans have had a non functioning alien spaceship since the fifties. What if they were able to study the ship and use what the learnt as a basis for modern computing.

This would make it more believable that the two systems work in a similar enough way to connect the ships.

*After the death of Brandon Lee on the set of The Crow, she had to return to the set in order to film the scene in which Eric Draven says "Sarah, I do care." with a body double in the character of Draven, but did not appear in another film until 2009.* </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I read that whole storyline when it first came out. I was 13 at the time and read it at my local newsagent/newstand after school. I'd finish school, go to the shop and read a couple of pages of the latest issue until the owner told me to get lost.

It was the first comic storyline I read from start to finish and has coloured all of my reading since.

	<TEXT> I work as a writer and consultant on con artists and scams so this is somewhat my specialty subject. 

Most 'real world' pickpockets lack the delicate skill of pickpocket entertainers or 'honest' pickpockets. After all, some one like Apollo will steal the watch off your wrist even after he's told you that he is going to. 

Street pickpockets rely on crowds, heavy misdirection and teamwork to steal your belongings. Entertainers have to do it under a literal spotlight.

Bob Arno is also very good but, if you're looking for a teacher, Apollo can not be beat. 

You might enjoy this annotated video I made of the opening scene of The Pickpocket (1954)

Its a pain in the ass. Who the hell wants to be with some miserable grump because he wants to get his performance right, so you have to call him this or call him that? 

"Its so boring. Ive been with actors like that and theyre a pain in the ass, they really are. Theyre unpleasant to work with and I dont think theyre always that good either."
