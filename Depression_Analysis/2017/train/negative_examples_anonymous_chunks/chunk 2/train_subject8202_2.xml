	<TEXT> You would miss Fox Sports 1   2, Pac 12 network, Big Ten network, CBS Sports Network. You would also miss any regional sports network in your area, going by your Umass flair you would miss NESN and CSN New England. Out of all of these the only networks listed here with "good" games would be FS1 and the Pac12 and B1G networks (which you already said you don't get). The RSN and CBSSN have some games but I think you can afford to not have them as it's usually lower tier games  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Today 5 more counties started offering gay marriage licenses after not doing so yesterday. 

Also it sounds like the governor has a sound head on his shoulders (never thought I would say that of an Alabama politician). 
It is important for people across the country to know that the governor of Alabama today is not the governor of Alabama 50 years ago. 

**and**

I dont want Alabama to be seen as it was 50 years ago when a federal law was defied. Im not going to do that, Im trying to move this state forward.

Of note: It is the 50th anniversary of the March on Selma in about 3 weeks, I think this is fresh on his and other Alabamans minds right now.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Also top voted comment on the article is as follows 


**Thomas:**
I walked into his chambers and could feel his steely eyes staring me down. His imposing figure loomed over me as I pressed my back against the wall. Roy dropped his judicial robes to the floor to reveal his well maintained body in all of its glory. His firm member showed a passion. It betrayed by his stone faced expression.
"I always wondered if you wore anything while you were on the bench..." I whispered.
"Shut up" Roy said as he advanced. He grabbed my shoulders forcefully and spun me around, bending me over his large mahogany desk. He drove himself into me from behind causing me to help slightly as I gripped the papers on his desk, moving them from the orderly piles there to be clenched in a fit of pain and passion.
"Oh, Roy!" I called out. "Shut up, Tommy" he insisted through gritted teeth.
Such was my first time.

**Response from Gary:** 
pervert

**Thomas reply:** 
Just when I thought my body could take no more, as I gasped and panted on the verge of collapse, Gary came in wearing a tight, wet T-shirt with a grin on his face.
"No, I can't..."I sputtered.
"You can." Roy said firmly.
"And you will." Gary said.
I lay back, ready to take whatever fate had brought me.
It was like kissing God.

**Gary again:** 
I take great satisfaction in knowing Hell is in your future.

**Thomas reply:**
"I take great satisfaction in knowing Hell is in your future." Gary said as he forced himself into my mouth. He arched his back as he did so before looking back down to me. "Now accept thy Lord..."

edit: For those that don't want to give the site clicks the headline is all you really need, also he said this on his facebook page so this is not an "official" order yet. It should also be noted the the governor said yesterday that he would not seek charges against judges who issue marriage licenses to gay couples. So once again Moore is alone in this fight.

And while I'm at it Chick-fil-A is just average fast food, people around here treat it like gospel

	<TEXT> I haven't been to that many games involving my teams, the worst experience that I can remember having is at the peach bowl (it was either 2002 or 2004). We live in the Atlanta area and my dad gets tickets through work every year to the game. So we usually don't have a stake in either team. We had some extra tickets and their was this family of Tennessee fans that needed tickets. My mom was like "oh they look like a nice clean cut family, why don't we sell our extra tickets to them". We did and they were so thankful, get to are seats in the Dome and they are right next to us. Well the moment the game starts these people turn into the most obnoxious drunk fans I have ever experienced. They were shouting so much that the people in front of us had to ask them to shut up because they were shouting right into their ears. The last straw was when the wife spilt beer on the guy in front of her, security was called and they were escorted out. We have never sold extra tickets to anyone since.  </TEXT>

When in reality  they are spending so little on domestic violence considering they make $10 billon a year. I'm also criticizing the fact that they partnered with NOmore, an organization that is not a nonprofit and is completely fake seeming to only be for branding http://deadspin.com/do-the-nfls-anti-domestic-violence-initiatives-actually-1682681513 </TEXT>
