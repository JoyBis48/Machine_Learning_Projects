	<TEXT> "I don't know much about beer and dislike the taste of most I've tried. Any recommendations?"  Yeah I have a recommendation- if you don't like it, don't drink it!!  I am not trying to sound/be a dick but if you honestly don't like it just stick to what you like!!  Everyone around where I live loves Sierra Nevada beer.  I have tried it several times but I just don't like it much. Its too heavy of a beer and I agree with you about light beer as I am not a huge beer guy myself and find that stuff easier to drink. I guess a lot of drinks are an acquired taste so I dunno I'm just saying if you have tried to drink beer quite a bit and still don't like it just skip it!!  haha I mean this in the best and nicest way lol.   Good luck in finding the right beer if you choose to keep trying!! </TEXT>

Btw I am on a legal prescription for norcos and I don't use any other drugs not even pot.  I just find that being honest is the best way to go. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> ok we sound in about the same place :)  I have had this doc for about 7 years now and we have a great relationship which I don't want to mess up but I feel like I do have a legitimate reason to get a bit more meds.  I've never done the doctor shopping thing and the pain managment clinics are very pricy since I am going thru Kaiser Permanente and its really cheap but which from what i have heard is the Wal Mart of hospitals but it is all I have I known.

	<TEXT> not sourcing whatsoever.....  i get 60 10/325s prescribed to me 1 month for legitimate pain from my doctor after being on 5/500s for about 5 years, yeah i know gross. i do have real pain and have the xrays/mris/etc to prove it.  I have been limiting myself to about 2 of the 10mgs a day just to get mobile.  I just feel like a junkie trying to get more opiates but at the same time i need them for the pain.  Problem is I am young (30) and I just don't want my trusting doctor to cut me off.....  Any suggestions?   </TEXT>

I only mess with pills- no H ever so its not like I could do the open air market deal is why I was mainly contemplating CL.  Sucks that it seems wayyyy easier to get heroin than some wimpy norcos haha!! I am not that hard up for pills so I doubt i'll actually ever get the balls up to do it. Still wish I knew how the SR worked 100% so I could confidently pull it off.  Anyways thanks everyone once again!! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> i hope so.......... i am trying my hardest as much as i love those opiates haha. like i said before i am trying to sound like a jerk or snob, i just hate withdrawls and really don't need a hell of a lot to get a nice buzz so I have always been very moderate with my opiate usage. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> only made mine better. cured my actual physical pain and also emotional.  i have a super cheap co pay and have rarely had to cop pills from the street(never touched anything stronger)  my tolerance has gone up a bit but I have been on the same program for about 10 years now and i'm only 30 so I feel that I have really good willpower. I understand how strong drugs are, especially opiates and I respect them never going on binges.....  I know i'll catch shit for what I wrote already saying i'm naive and cocky or whatever but I am this is how I humbly put it.  Losing both of my parents at a very young age from drugs has helped me pace myself with my addictions to put a long story short........ </TEXT>
