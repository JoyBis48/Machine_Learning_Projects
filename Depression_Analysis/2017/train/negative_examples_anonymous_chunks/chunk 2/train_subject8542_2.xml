	<TEXT> I'm probably a tad late for this one, but I'll post anyway.
Not even my story, either, but my Parents'.

I was 12, and I was staying out at a friends place a few miles away, my sister was also out at her friends just down the street.

Must have been about 11pm, my parents were sat on the sofa downstairs, watching TV and getting ready to go to sleep, when they heard a small thumping upstairs from my room, then nothing.

A minute or two later, down the stairs came 5 or 6 little bouncy balls (You know, the kind which are tiny, choking hazards to children and bounce like motherfuckers)

Now, in order for the bouncies that were in my room to come down the stairs, they'd have to roll out of my room, down a corridor, turn left twice and then bounce down.

Here's the funny bit.

*Mine were still in my room*

 My sister didn't own any. She wasn't awesome enough. </TEXT>

House for me. House overseas for the parents, when they retire, Spain most likely.
House for my sister and her boyfriend, just to shut 'em up

Clear all current loans. Buy a new car for me, nothing flash, though!

Buy a bunch of tailored clothes, because I'm sick of wearing Jeans and graphic tees. :( </TEXT>

Also, I'm looking forward to playing. I haven't read much into it, as I signed up and downloaded last night on a whim after seeing a billboard ad on the way home from work </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Whenever I go to the city centre, I usually park in a little car park just past Salford Central. Just off New Bailey Street, before it becomes Bridge Street

If you've got a satnav, put in Browncross Street. If not, when you go under the bridge with Salford Central, turn left down the side street just after Stephensons. 

Parked there a while back for a few quid, though it's a bit of a walk for the Arena.  </TEXT>
