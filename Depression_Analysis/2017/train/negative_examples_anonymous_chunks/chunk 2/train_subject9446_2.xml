	<TEXT> What he thinks... means nothing

To criticise with compassion is more skillful than to criticise with hatred. Hatred blinds. Someone doesn't need to be a degree-laden 'psychiatrist' to have meaningful things to say. George Lucas has created beautiful films (American Graffiti), and has self-consciously exploited the study of personality archetypes as successfully as anyone else (Star Wars). But more important than that - he is an elder of our tribe. Something tells me you had forgotten that. Correct me if I'm wrong.

All bodies pass through the universal substance, as it were into and out of a rushing stream; cohering and cooperating with the whole, as do our physical members with one another. How many a Chrysippus, a Socrates, an Epictetus has been engulfed by time! Remember this where you have to do with any man or thing whatsoever. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Wrong, wrong, wrong.

I was trying to discourage those, (perhaps you fall into this category, perhaps not), who stumble blindly in the hell-realm that is addiction to video-games. I know a man who is in his thirties and plays video games. People mock him behind his back about it, and he has admitted to me that he feels 'shame' (his word) about his habit. True story. I, out of compassion, would like to save others from his fate.

And, **I was trying to encourage** the rays of hope out there, (One must never abandon hope. It was not without reason some Catholic theologians called despair 'the one unforgivable sin'), the comparatively enlightened video game apologist (like rawkuts) into singing in this chillest of chill lands. 

I don't know what you are or aren't envious of. I can assure you however that the video game prison looks less attractive from the outside than from within.

Perhaps drugs can help one ['to strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield'](http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poem/174659), perhaps they can't. One thing for sure is that they make for a better [Lotos](http://www.bartleby.com/42/638.html) than does video games.

Yes. It might help you to understand where I'm coming from if I told you that I'm beyond Good and Evil inasmuch as I think instead in regards to that which is *kusala* and *akusala* or 'skillful' and 'unskillful'. The idea that some people know more and are wiser than others is non-negotiable and incontrovertible to my mind.

Relevant: 

"Abandon what is unskillful, monks. It is possible to abandon what is unskillful. If it were not possible to abandon what is unskillful, I would not say to you, 'Abandon what is unskillful.' But because it is possible to abandon what is unskillful, I say to you, 'Abandon what is unskillful.' If this abandoning of what is unskillful were conducive to harm and pain, I would not say to you, 'Abandon what is unskillful.' But because this abandoning of what is unskillful is conducive to benefit and pleasure, I say to you, 'Abandon what is unskillful.'

"Develop what is skillful, monks. It is possible to develop what is skillful. If it were not possible to develop what is skillful, I would not say to you, 'Develop what is skillful.' But because it is possible to develop what is skillful, I say to you, 'Develop what is skillful.' If this development of what is skillful were conducive to harm and pain, I would not say to you, 'Develop what is skillful.' But because this development of what is skillful is conducive to benefit and pleasure, I say to you, 'Develop what is skillful.'"

I've not played Final Fantasy 10 (DAE think that is a ridiculous name. Like, 'Last of the Mohicans 2: Back with a vengeance!'). Is there a conscientious objector option or does one have to contort oneself into 'killer mode'?

* It wasn't an arbitrary statement/belief, sadly. I'm trying to help people. The lives that I will 'save' and the potential I will emancipate is worth my time. Of course it would be better if nothing had to be 'put down', that better world does not exist. Here in this world is suffering and dissipation. There are those things that lead to suffering and dissipation. And there are those who encourage, and those who discourage, those things that lead to suffering and dissipation. Often the opposite of dissipation leads to suffering. As often, and arguably more dangerous, is when the opposite of suffering leads to dissipation which then leads to increased suffering.

	<TEXT> I can't imagine anyone who wakes up in the morning and vows to devote themselves that day to the common good of all sentient beings would decide to spend the day playing board games in front of the television. 

Nonetheless, I will say a few words in their favour. Board games at least (usually?) require human contact so they have that going for them. 

With television, the consumption of the content can obtain with the agent's agency comparably intact. I am presented something, and then   I am beholden to no-one (not event the writer or director or leading lady) as to what opinions, and conclusions I have. I can 'make of it' what I like. With a video game I have to acquiesce with its creator to consume the content. Whatsoever she considers a door, I have to see as a door. Whatsoever she considers a task, I must consider a task. Whatsoever she considers the goal, I must assume as the goal. Whilst, one cannot 'fail' at 'The Godfather' (1972: Paramount Pictures) through being aghast at the characters' misdeeds, one could never possibly win at 'The Godfather: The Game' (2010: EA Games) without having to replicate (via your *avatar*) acts 'fearsome' and cruel.

An insect is capable of making the sort of decisions involved in Tetris. A human life wasted on such things is a sad thing however. If I was feeling poetic I'd say (after [Blake](http://www.poetryloverspage.com/poets/blake/to_see_world.html), of course)

	<TEXT> * The first article you quoted was awful. 

 So the fact that video game players are better at
'using a joystick and looking one way while reaching in a different direction' shows they are better at 'laparoscopic surgery'? I'm glad that no one actually believes that playing video games makes one a qualified surgeon. I'd wager that the surgeons who play video games would be worse surgeons than those that don't because they would take life less seriously and value human life less.

* 'Brain flexibility'? What kind of newspeak is this? I'd rather have a strong intellect, or a keen perception than a flexible brain. Quisling had a flexible brain. If I was a military general, I'd like recruits with 'flexible brains'. All the better to turn them from men to animals.

 And, surprise, surprise! Look who funded the study:

This research was supported by Air Force Office of Scientific Research (www.afosr.af.mil) grant FA9550-10-1-0268, Army Research Laboratory (www.arl.army.mil) grant

Do I believe that with this precious human life, with so many different things to do, finding ways simply to 'pass the time' is a waste of time? Yes I do. The time will pass whatever we do. It is our responsibility to use it well. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> * I have played, seen, and can name a video game.

* I am talking about the universe in which this 'morality system' takes place. If one were to 'save a tribe of villagers from a volcano' on a video game one would, on one level of consciousness, associate saving tribes of villagers from a volcano with what you did whilst playing that game. The necessary meaninglessness of the video game world (i.e. its video game-ness) has a toxic influence on a 'morality system' that has to exist in the world outside the game console, television and gamer ecology. The difference between saving a tribe of villagers and not saving a tribe of villagers on a video game has no effect on the number of lives lost (except perhaps that of the 'gamer', but that's an argument for elsewhere). The difference between saving a tribe of villagers and not saving a tribe of villagers - in real life - does have an effect that can be equated in terms of suffering caused and human lives lost. The 'morality system' cannot be equivalent or comparable between the two 'worlds'.

* 'Brutality beyond the minimum' is a phrase that has been forged by video games, I'm sure. I'll leave you to work out the irony. Correct me if I'm wrong.

* I don't think 'concomitantly' is a particularly difficult word. Let me know if you still don't understand what it means.

* It was George Lucas. His comments can be read here: http://www.theverge.com/2013/6/13/4427444/lucas-spielberg-storytelling-in-games-its-not-going-to-be-shakespeare-usc  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> **The Ladder of St. Augustine**

BY HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW

* * *
     
     
     Saint Augustine! well hast thou said,
     
      That of our vices we can frame

     A ladder, if we will but tread
     
      Beneath our feet each deed of shame!


     All common things, each day's events,
     
      That with the hour begin and end,

     Our pleasures and our discontents,
     
      Are rounds by which we may ascend.


     The low desire, the base design,
     
      That makes another's virtues less;

     The revel of the ruddy wine,
     
      And all occasions of excess;


     The longing for ignoble things;
     
      The strife for triumph more than truth;

     The hardening of the heart, that brings
     
      Irreverence for the dreams of youth;


     All thoughts of ill; all evil deeds,
     
      That have their root in thoughts of ill;

     Whatever hinders or impedes
     
      The action of the nobler will; 

     

     All these must first be trampled down
     
      Beneath our feet, if we would gain

     In the bright fields of fair renown
     
      The right of eminent domain.

     

     We have not wings, we cannot soar;
     
      But we have feet to scale and climb

     By slow degrees, by more and more,
     
      The cloudy summits of our time.

     

     The mighty pyramids of stone
     
      That wedge-like cleave the desert airs,

     When nearer seen, and better known,
     
      Are but gigantic flights of stairs.

     

     The distant mountains, that uprear
     
      Their solid bastions to the skies,

     Are crossed by pathways, that appear
     
      As we to higher levels rise.

     

     The heights by great men reached and kept
     
      Were not attained by sudden flight,

     But they, while their companions slept,
     
      Were toiling upward in the night.

     

     Standing on what too long we bore
     
      With shoulders bent and downcast eyes,

     We may discern  unseen before 
     
      A path to higher destinies,

     

     Nor doom the irrevocable Past
     
      As wholly wasted, wholly vain,

     If, rising on its wrecks, at last
     
      To something nobler we attain. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> **A GURU - WOULD I TRUST ONE? (Analytical Meditation)**

- Did I educate myself, who taught me the things I know? 


- Could I have learned to talk, read, write without relying on a teacher? 


- Could a sceptical 6-year old ever learn to read, without having a positive and open attitude? 


- Is it possible that other people know more than me? 


- Do trustworthy people exist at all? 


- What qualities would I expect of a real spiritual teacher? 


- Would I recognise a real spiritual teacher when I met one? 


- Would I like to have a spiritual teacher to make good progress or just to get rid of the responsibilities for my own life?

	<TITLE> 'Nietzsche's Burst of Laughter'- Gilles Deleuze interviewed by Guy Dumur. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-04-08 14:28:16 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> 


**Dumur**: How was the new edition of Nietzsche's Complete Philosophical Works established?

**Deleuze**: The problem was to reclassify the posthumous notesthe Nachlassin accordance with the dates Nietzsche had written them, and to place them after the works with which they were contemporaneous. Some of them had been used in an abusive way after Nietzsche's death to compose The Will to Power. So it was essential to reestablish the exact chronology. This explains why the first volume, The Gay Science, is more than half composed of previously unpublished fragments dating from 1881-1882. Our conception of Nietzsche's thought as well as his creative process may be profoundly altered as a result. The new edition will appear simultaneously in Italy, Germany, and France. But we owe the texts to the work of two Italians, Colli and Montinari.

**Dumur**: How do you explain that Italians rather than Germans did the job?

**Deleuze**: Maybe the Germans were not in a good position to do it. They already had numerous editions, which they were fond of, despite the arbitrary organization of the notes. Also, Nietzsche's manuscripts were in Weimar, East Germanywhere the Italians were better received than any West German could have hoped to be. Finally, the Germans were undoubtedly embarrassed at having accepted the edition of The Will to Power created by Nietzsche's sister. Elizabeth Forster-Nietzsche put together an extremely harmful work that privileges many Nazi interpretations. She didn't falsify the texts, but we know well enough that there are other ways to distort an author's thinking, even if it is merely an arbitrary selection from among his papers. Nietzschean concepts like those of "force" or "master" are complex enough to be betrayed by a selection such as hers.

**Dumur**: Will the translations be new?

**Deleuze**: Completely new. This is especially important for those writings toward the end (there have been some poor readings, for which Elizabeth Nietzsche and Peter Gast are responsible). The first two volumes to be published, The Gay Science and Human, All Too Human, have been translated by Pierre Klossowski and Robert Rovini. This doesn't mean that the prior translations by Henri Albert, and by Genevieve Bianquis, were badnot at all. But if they were determined to publish Nietzsche's notes with his works, they had to begin from scratch and unify the terminology. On that note, interestingly enough, Nietzsche was first introduced in France not by the "right," but by Charles Andler and Henri Albert, who represented a whole socialist tradition with anarchical colorings.

**Dumur**: Do you think a "return to Nietzsche" is taking place in France today? And if so, why is it?

**Deleuze**: It's difficult to say. Maybe there has been a change, or maybe the change is taking place now, with respect to the modes of thought which have been so familiar to us since the Liberation. We were used to thinking dialectically, historically. Today it seems the tide has turned from dialectical thinking toward structuralism, for example, as well as other systems of thought.

Foucault insists on the importance of the techniques of interpretation. It's possible that in the actual idea of interpretation is something which goes beyond the dialectical opposition between "knowing" and "transforming" the world. Freud is the great interpreter, so is Nietzsche, but in a different way. Nietzsche's idea is that things and actions are already interpretations. So to interpret is to interpret interpretations, and thus to change things, "to change life." What is clear for Nietzsche is that society cannot be an ultimate authority. The ultimate authority is creation, it is art: or rather, art represents the absence and the impossibility of an ultimate authority. From the very beginning of his work, Nietzsche posits that there exist ends "just a little higher" than those of the State, than those of society. He inserts his entire corpus in a dimension which is neither historical, even understood dialectically, nor eternal. What he calls this new dimension which operates both in time and against time is the untimely. It is in this that life as interpretation finds its source. Maybe the reason for the "return to Nietzsche" is a rediscovery of the untimely, that dimension which is distinct both from classical philosophy in its "timeless" enterprise and from dialectical philosophy in its understanding of history: a singular element of upheaval.

**Dumur**: Could we then say this is a return to individualism?

**Deleuze**: Yes, but a bizarre individualism, in which modern consciousness undoubtedly recognizes itself to some degree. Because in Nietzsche, this individualism is accompanied by a lively critique of the notions of "self" and "I." For Nietzsche there is a kind of dissolution of the self. The reaction against oppressive structures is no longer done, for him, in the name of a "self" or an "I." On the contrary, it is as though the "self" and the "I" were accomplices of those structures.

Must we say that the return to Nietzsche implies a kind of aestheticism, a renunciation of politics, an "individualism" as depersonalized as it is depoliticized? Maybe not. Politics, too, is in the business of interpretation. The untimely, which we just discussed, is never reducible to the political-historical element. But it happens from time to time that, at certain great moments, they coincide. When people die of hunger in India, such a disaster is political-historical. But when the people struggle for their liberation, there is always a coincidence of poetic acts and historical events or political actions, the glorious incarnation of something sublime or untimely. Such great coincidences are Nasser's burst of laughter when he nationalized Suez, or Castro's gestures, and that other burst of laughter, Giap's television interview. Here we have something that reminds us of Rimbaud's or Nietzsche's imperatives and which puts one over on Marxan artistic joy that comes to coincide with historical struggle. There are creators in politics, and creative movements, that are poised for a moment in history. Hitler, on the contrary, lacked to a singular degree any Nietzschean element. Hitler is not Zarathoustra. Nor is Trujillo. They represented what Nietzsche calls "the monkey of Zarathoustra." As Nietzsche said, if one wants to be "a master," it is not enough to come to power. More often than not it is the "slaves" who come to power, and who keep it, and who remain slaves while they keep it.

The masters according to Nietzsche are the untimely, those who create, who destroy in order to create, not to preserve. Nietzsche says that under the huge earth-shattering events are tiny silent events, which he likens to the creation of new worlds: there once again you see the presence of the poetic under the historical. In France, for instance, there are no earth-shattering events right now. They are far away, and horrible, in Vietnam. But we still have tiny imperceptible events, which maybe announce an exodus from today's desert. Maybe the return to Nietzsche is one of those "tiny events" and already a reinterpretation of the world.

	<TEXT> At that sound the bent shape of the king sprang suddenly erect. Tall and proud he seemed again; and rising in his stirrups he cried in a loud voice, more clear than any there had ever heard a mortal man achieve before:

  Arise, arise, Riders of Thoden!

  Fell deeds awake: fire and slaughter!

  Spear shall be shaken, shield be splintered,

  A sword-day, a red day, ere the sun rises!

  Ride now, ride now! Ride to Gondor!

With that he seized a great horn from Guthlf his banner-bearer, and he blew such a blast upon it that it burst asunder. And straightway all the horns in the host were lifted up in music, and the blowing of the horns of Rohan in that hour was like a storm upon the plain and a thunder in the mountains.

   Ride now, ride now! Ride to Gondor!

Suddenly the king cried to Snowmane and the horse sprang away. Behind him his banner blew in the wind, white horse upon a field of green, but he outpaced it. After him thundered the knights of his house, but he was ever before them. omer rode there, the white horsetail on his helm floating in his speed, and the front of the first ored roared like a breaker foaming to the shore, but Thoden could not be overtaken. Fey he seemed, or the battle-fury of his fathers ran like new fire in his veins, and he was borne up on Snowmane like a god of old, even as rome the Great in the battle of the Valar when the world was young. His golden shield was uncovered, and lo! it shone like an image of the Sun, and the grass flamed into green about the white feet of his steed. For morning came, morning and a wind from the sea; and darkness was removed, and the hosts of Mordor wailed, and terror took them, and they fled, and died, and the hoofs of wrath rode over them. And then all the host of Rohan burst into song, and they sang as they slew, for the joy of battle was on them, and the sound of their singing that was fair and terrible came even to the City. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> *"If you started in the wrong way," I said in answer to the investigator's questions, "everything that happened
would be a proof of the conspiracy against you. It would all be selfvalidating. You couldn't draw a breath
without knowing it was part of the plot."*

*"So you think you know where madness lies?"*

*My answer was a convinced and heartfelt, "Yes."*

*"And you couldn't control it?"*

*"No I couldn't control it. If one began with fear and hate as the major premise, one would have to go on the
conclusion."*

*"Would you be able," my wife asked, " to fix your attention on what The Tibetan Book of the Dead calls the
Clear Light?"*

*I was doubtful.*

*"Would it keep the evil away, if you could hold it? Or would you not be able to hold it?"*

*I considered the question for some time. "Perhaps," I answered at last, "perhaps I could  but only if there were
somebody there to tell me about the Clear Light. One couldn't do it by oneself. That's the point, I suppose, of the
Tibetan ritual  somebody sitting there all the time and telling you what's what."*

[Aldous Huxley, 'Doors of Perception', 5758]


**I. General Introduction**


A psychedelic experience is a journey to new realms of consciousness. The scope and content of the experience
is limitless, but its characteristic features are the transcendence of verbal concepts, of spacetime dimensions,
and of the ego or identity. Such experiences of enlarged consciousness can occur in a variety of ways: sensory
deprivation, yoga exercises, disciplined meditation, religious or aesthetic ecstasies, or spontaneously. Most
recently they have become available to anyone through the ingestion of psychedelic drugs such as LSD,
psilocybin, mescaline, DMT, etc. [This is the statement of an ideal, not an actual situation, in 1964. The
psychedelic drugs are in the United States classified as "experimental" drugs. That is, they are not available on a
prescription basis, but only to "qualified investigators." The Federal Food and Drug Administration has defined
"qualified investigators" to mean psychiatrists working in a mental hospital setting, whose research is sponsored
by either state or federal agencies.]

Of course, the drug dose does not produce the transcendent experience. It merely acts as a chemical key  it
opens the mind, frees the nervous system of its ordinary patterns and structures. The nature of the experience
depends almost entirely on set and setting. Set denotes the preparation of the individual, including his
personality structure and his mood at the time. Setting is physical  the weather, the room's atmosphere; social 
feelings of persons present towards one another; and cultural  prevailing views as to what is real. It is for this
reason that manuals or guidebooks are necessary. Their purpose is to enable a person to understand the new
realities of the expanded consciousness, to serve as road maps for new interior territories which modern science
has made accessible.

Different explorers draw different maps. Other manuals are to be written based on different models  scientific,
aesthetic, therapeutic. The Tibetan model, on which this manual is based, is designed to teach the person to
direct and control awareness in such a way as to reach that level of understanding variously called liberation,
illumination, or enlightenment. If the manual is read several times before a session is attempted, and if a trusted
person is there to remind and refresh the memory of the voyager during the experience, the consciousness will
be freed from the games which comprise "personality" and from positivenegative hallucinations which often
accompany states of expanded awareness. The Tibetan Book of the Dead was called in its own language the
Bardo Thodol, which means "Liberation by Hearing on the AfterDeath Plane." The book stresses over and over
that the free consciousness has only to hear and remember the teachings in order to be liberated.

The Tibetan Book of the Dead is ostensibly a book describing the experiences to be expected at the moment of
death, during an intermediate phase lasting fortynine (seven times seven) days, and during rebirth into another
bodily frame. This however is merely the exoteric framework which the Tibetan Buddhists used to cloak their
mystical teachings. The language and symbolism of death rituals of Bonism, the traditional preBuddhist
Tibetan religion, were skillfully blended with Buddhist conceptions. The esoteric meaning, as it has been
interpreted in this manual, is that it is death and rebirth that is described, not of the body. Lama Govinda
indicates this clearly in his introduction when he writes: "It is a book for the living as well as the dying." The
book's esoteric meaning is often concealed beneath many layers of symbolism. It was not intended for general
reading. It was designed to be understood only by one who was to be initiated personally by a guru into the
Buddhist mystical doctrines, into the premortemdeath rebirth experience. These doctrines have been kept a
closely guarded secret for many centuries, for fear that naive or careless application would do harm. In
translating such an esoteric text, therefore, there are two steps: one, the rendering of the original text into
English; and two, the practical interpretation of the text for its uses. In publishing this practical interpretation for
use in the psychedelic drug session, we are in a sense breaking with the tradition of secrecy and thus
contravening the teachings of the lamagurus.

However, this step is justified on the grounds that the manual will not be understood by anyone who has not had
a consciousnessexpanding experience and that there are signs that the lamas themselves, after their recent
diaspora, wish to make their teachings available to a wider public. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>      Joyful to have
     Such a human birth,
     Difficult to find,
     Free and well-favored.	

     But death is real,
     Comes without warning.
     This body
     Will be a corpse.

     Unalterable
     Are the laws of karma;
     Cause and effect
     Cannot be escaped.	

     Samsara
     Is an ocean of suffering,
     Unendurable,
     Unbearably intense.
