	<TEXT> Circumcision is on that same line as vaccinating your child. It's your responsibility as a parent to make decisions for your child as they themselves are not able to. If you decide as a parent that the pros outweigh the cons, then get your child vaccinated, and vice versa. Any boys I have will probably be circumcised, and vaccinated, and put into a public school :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There's nothing wrong with it. Its a parents choice, just like vaccinations. It's a parents responsibility to weigh pros and cons and make the decision based on what they believe is best for their child. </TEXT>
