	<TEXT> Like any /r/Bitcoin anyone will tell you, If it's going to make you have to move back in to mom and dads if it crashes, don't do it. But if you live at home or have the extra money? Go for it! The latest DDOS attacks and the lack in value drop tell you a little something about the resilience and sheer Spartanism that is Bitcoin. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When I worked at Safeway 15 years ago or so, we would have employee parties and there would be way to much food, I'm talking in excess of 5 time to much. Instead of sending leftovers home with employees, or better yet, donating to a local charities. They had us (Courtesy clerks) throw all the food into the trash compactor. I asked my GM why they didn't donate the food or send it home with the employees and he said "If we send it home with you guys that's stealing, If we donate it we make less than writing it off as a loss." Fucked up as far as I am concerned. There's homeless people rite outside of where I worked.... GIVE IT TO THEM DOUCHES! </TEXT>
