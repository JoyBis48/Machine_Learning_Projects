	<TEXT> Hi folks!

**Sorry my power cut off yesterday. Choosing the winners now!** 

I'm giving away 18 games that I did not redeem yet from Humble Bundle. 

**How to participate**: Tell me a number between 1 and 18 in comments and upvote this threat which will be the game that you'll get.. with a little bit of luck! I won't publish the list with the games until the giveaway ends to make it a little bit more exciting for you. If you want you could be so kind and attach a kitten gif to your post. Or something else cute. 

**How I will choose the winners:**  I will choose the winner ~~via [RedditRaffle](http://www.redditraffle.com/)~~ [this little script](http://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/2b063y/meta_alternative_to_redditrafflecom_for_giveaway/)

**How long will the Giveaway last?** It will last until next Saturday. (30. August 2014)

**I wish you all the best possible luck!** </TEXT>
