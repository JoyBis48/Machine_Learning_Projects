	<TEXT> Hawaii and Arizona do not follow daylight-savings time because they recognize that it is a fraud, and a clear and present danger to the spacetime continuum.

When a program shows at 8:00pm Mountain Time during DST, the conflicting signals cause electrical arcs to surge from the ground in Arizona an hour into the future, killing anyone not wearing crocs or rain boots.  This is much like Tesla's experiments with pulling power out of the vacuum using a wet paper bag and a magnetron.  It was far too dangerous and the program was pulled. </TEXT>
