	<TEXT> I highly doubt it would be able to get a lucky shot. Modern tanks move and engage way too quickly. Even if a WW2 tank was lucky enough to surprise a modern battle tank it would not be able to fire quickly enough to engage. And no WW2 tank could take even a glancing blow from a modern 120mm. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've been watching the BBC show "Copper". It's a good crime drama set in NYC during the Civil War.

I watched the WWII drama "Generation War" and really liked it as well. It's a three part series with each episode running approx 90 minutes.

Both are avail on Netflix streaming.
