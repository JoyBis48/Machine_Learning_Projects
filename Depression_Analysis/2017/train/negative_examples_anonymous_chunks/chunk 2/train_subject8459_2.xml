	<TEXT> It does seem to be that way, all of the players I've used it with have been friendly and it really helps improve your teamwork, the only downside is when you go to chat and only one other person has it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Your job is to try and help teammates, whether it's bodyblocking basics to save them, or using abilities to help them. Another job of yours is to set up kills for people and try to help them obtain kills. On top of this, you must ward all around, steal objectives with hand of the gods rank 3 and rotate all around helping other lanes and taking mid camps. </TEXT>
