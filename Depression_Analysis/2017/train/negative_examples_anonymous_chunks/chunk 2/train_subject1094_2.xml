	<TEXT> You're right. However, most people I know, friends and family have bought houses close to work or/and in good neighborhoods. I don't think we in Holland have adopted the American way of buying a house an hour or 2 away from where we work. Also, from my understanding and I could be wrong here, there are a lot of houses for sale in undesirable neighborhoods.

So, I think we the Dutch choose to pay more and thus compete for scarce property.

EDIT: Here is some data from the Dutch Association of Real Estate Agents http://www.globalpropertyguide.com/Europe/Netherlands/Price-History


    In 2008, house prices fell by 5.3% (-7.5% in real terms)
    In 2009, house prices dropped by 1.5% (-2.4% in real terms)
    In 2010, house prices rose slightly by 1% (-0.7% in real terms)
    In 2011, house prices dropped by 3.8% (-6.2% in real terms)

As you can see, the drop per year is not really dramatic percentage wise. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Houses are scarce in The Netherlands and the pressure on prices has mostly been upward which is what keeps the house prices from tumbling rapidly. The cost of buying a house eats up a large proportion of income for an average Dutch citizen which is part of living in the Netherlands.

Volkskrant did a story about the Dutch economy. Here is the English version of it "10 misconceptions about the Dutch economy" http://www.dutchnews.nl/features/2013/08/volkskrant_10_misconceptions_a.php </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I lived in Marbella for over a year. I would go once a month to Gibraltar to buy cigarettes since they were much cheaper than in Spain. 

I remember the always crowded border crossing with Spaniards going over to shop and the hundred of tourists visiting. It would be a terrible blow to Gibraltar's economy.

I have a hard time believing this will even be considered by the EU let alone implementing it. </TEXT>
