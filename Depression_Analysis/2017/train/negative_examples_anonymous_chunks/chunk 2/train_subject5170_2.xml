	<TEXT> People who swear and get abusive in their posts are revealing the weakness of their arguments. Military-style assault weapons were developed for use in war, to kill people. They are inanimate objects that are used by people.

"Retired Gen. Stanley McChrystal came out in favor of gun control restrictions in a Tuesday morning appearance on MSNBC's "Morning Joe."

"I spent a career carrying typically either a M16, and later a M4 carbine," he said. "And a M4 carbine fires a .223 caliber round, which is 5.56 millimeters, at about 3,000 feet per second. When it hits a human body, the effects are devastating. It's designed to do that. That's what our soldiers ought to carry."

Said McChrystal, "I personally don't think there's any need for that kind of weaponry on the streets and particularly around the schools in America. I believe that we've got to take a serious look -- I understand everybody's desire to have whatever they want -- but we have to protect our children and our police and we have to protect our population. And I think we have to take a very mature look at that."

So I imagine the general is wrong, according to you. And you know better. </TEXT>

If you only want to look at murders, then find a report that only looks at murders -- that's not what this one does. But from a public safety standpoint, when talking about regulation, all deaths are more relevant than just murders -- including accidents and suicides. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have not been shooting but do have a family member who is a hunter. 

In my opinion, the previous assault weapon ban was ineffective because NRA-backed members of Congress inserted a lot of loopholes. 

I'm not an absolutist on an assault ban, though, and think we should get what we can on this issue, such as universal background checks and improved mental health reporting. I predict that the NRA will come out as strongly against universal background checks, though.

I agree on the gang violence -- I think universal background checks, and a trafficking provision, would help there. I live in the Chicago area, and recently read that a large percentage of Chicago gang guns are purchased from third parties who buy them in largish batches from our gun-lax neighbor, Indiana.

	<TEXT> So you acknowledge that the government has the right to regulate what kinds of arms people can have, and what types of people should be allowed to have them. We agree.

Also, you realize that corporations and the 1% get a lot of government handouts by means of tax policy, right?
