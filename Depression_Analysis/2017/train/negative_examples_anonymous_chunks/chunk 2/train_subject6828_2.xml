	<TEXT> It is important as an actor to convey a real performance.


In this case the director took it upon himself to force a genuine performance out of his performers. A bad director would do this right off the bat without allowing the actors a few takes first but this is a proactive method in my opinion. It shouldn't go too far to the point of abuse, such as Hitchcock on the birds or Kubrick on the shining. </TEXT>

An actor is an artist who would prefer you know them by their roles. Kevin Spacey is one such artist. He IS Frank Underwood. Kevin Spacey has made it a habit to stay out of the spotlight in order to better blend into his characters from the audiences' perspective. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would prefer a man-woman pairing with the man being jaded and cynical and the woman young and idealistic. An added bonus would be if he's a sexist but really good at his job, kinda like Dr. House. I am personally a bit tired of the rural setting so either a big city or a snowy locale. Both of these places can foster feelings of isolation. I think the villain should be an active serial killer who makes it a point to contact the police. Also, a twist would be nice but not that one of the detectives is the killer (lazy writing).

Edit: also we need more tracking shots. </TEXT>
