	<TEXT> So, I guess the bigger question is, when will it be over. It seems as though much of modern human history is about the rights of humans-Martin Luthers thesis seem to be in the same vain in a weird niche way, so how does it end? Does it just move on to something/someone else?

Anyway, this is a great article, full of lots of little history goodies. </TEXT>
