	<TEXT> Nice job, dancing around and twisting my words. I don't know either way if the levels of CO2 in the atmosphere is good or not (most evidence says its bad), but the way its extracted from the ground is definitely terrible.

Go look up about the Canadian Oil Sands, probably the ugliest scar in my country. Thousands of square kilometres of forests leveled and rivers poisoned to dig black shit out of the ground. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In a similar vein, Eight Legged Freaks.

8 year old me watching a "comedy" about your not-so-friendly neighbourhood spiders traumatized me into having arachnophobia.

Webs make me uncomfortable, if I see a spider I go apeshit on it with something heavy, and people who post pictures of common phobias on reddit and social media, fuck you.

Edit: just yesterday someone front paged with about bed checking in Dominican for spiders. </TEXT>

And I did not know he won on that platform, which in itself is pathetic on the candidates and voters part.

When said voters realize, "shit, we fucked up," all the changes made will take a while to correct. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It varies with every brand and type of knife. Cheap knives are made to not be sharpened, because they're essentially disposable. Good brands like Henckels, Victorinox, and Global are standard edged, so just put the blade 12* to the stone.

Some other notes, I prefer water stones because its a little quieter, but you end up with water all over the counter (not a big deal).

As well, there's two common styles of sharpening, European and Asian/Japanese. Basically European starts with the block lengthwise towards you, and sharpened by dragging the heel of the blade towards and to the side of you, to get the whole blade. Japanese is faster, but trickier. Take the knife in a good grip and use a chiselling motion from tip to heel (holy hell don't stab the stone and break the knife!).

I like to start Japanese on a rough stone to start with a new edge, then work up over three grades of stones with European. Every few strokes run your thumb perpendicular the blade to check for a lip. If there's one you oversharpened one side. And use the steel rod to finish. And keep using it when using knives a lot. I run my French knife over steel every 15-20 minutes of continuous use. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Professional cook here, if the knife in question makes a lot of noise during sharpening, the person sharpening is doing it wrong.

On rough grits it should sound quieter than walking on gravel, smooth grits shouldn't make any noticeable sound.

If you mean running the edge over the steel rods, that is the most satisfying sound we love to hear in the kitchen. That doesn't sharpen the knife, it straightens the blade, and should sound gloriously smooth if sharpening was done right. </TEXT>
