	<TEXT>  contrary examples are hard to find and they are

On this subreddit, yes. Not in the world.

  they are only human afterall

at least you concede that!

  but what with seemingly 9/10 jews claiming to be irreligious or atheist

Are you saying that being religious is necessary for being ethical? Because there are quite a lot of contrary examples of that as well.

Yes, it is complicated.  "Jews" means a lot of different things to different people.  Basically my point is, you can't pigeonhole people. If you go around assuming things about people and treating them based off of your ASSUMPTIONS about them, it's not only incredibly hurtful to people who don't deserve your scorn, but you are also missing out on some potential allies.

So you don't like racism right?  I'll leave you with the word's the late great MJ:
If you want to make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself, and then make a change

	<TEXT> Yes, it took me about 2 minutes of searching Google.  There are actually millions of stories of jews acting compassionately and peacefully.  I posted the wikipedia article to illustrate that it's actually something that's part of the religion.

	<TEXT> I certainly don't have a geocentric view of the world.  Rather, the center is everywhere.  Also, the shift in my view wasn't based solely on scientific discovery, though it certainly played a part.  I think most importantly was the profound feelings of connection I felt that I couldn't easily rationalize away (and really I no longer have any desire to rationalize these things away).  I guess I really don't understand why some people try so hard to remove all sense of magic from the world.  Is that really the world you want to live in? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> At the end of the day, there are many things that we don't KNOW.  So where do go from there?  We kind of fill in the blanks.  You can be agnostic about these things, and that's honorable, but sometimes entertaining a belief that you are not 100% sure of is not only harmless, but useful.  For instance, you might not be sure that you can run a marathon.  But you harbor this belief in yourself that you can, and this causes you to push yourself and train, and then lo and behold! you ran a marathon!  I think many things work this way.  Our thoughts actually create our reality.  I don't believe in objective truth and the process of belief to me is very much a creative one. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It absolutely led me to believe that my view of the world was too simplistic.  Part of that was realizing that a simple rejection of any notion of spirituality or connection to something larger than myself was too simplistic.  I accept that there is a whole lot that we don't know.  We will continue to learn more and more about the universe and our place in it.  I don't know if we will ever have a definitive answer to these really big questions, and for the moment I have to rely on what I *intuit* and what feels the best.  It seems to me like a lot of atheist are really uncomfortable with the idea of CHOOSING to believe something, but I think if they took a good look at their own thought process, they would realize they are doing the exact same thing. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Realistically, that probably won't happen, so my career plan at the moment for the future is to be a dietician.

I've got to stop you right there.  I was nodding my head through your entire post enthusiastically until I read this line.  You need to understand that you are the creator of your own destiny.  The cliche "whether you believe you can or can't, you're right" stands here.  Study and become a dietician if this makes you happy, it's a great thing to do, but never subjugate your dreams for something more "realistic".

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT>  I am an ex-atheist. I know what atheism is, I was very proud to ascribe this label to myself between the ages of 13 til about 18. I didn't call myself agnostic, I was sure. I took a completely mechanical, deterministic view of the universe. Everything was simply an unfolding of chemical reactions since the Big Bang and in that universe, there is no room for free will, let alone "God".

So what changed? Well, for one, I found out that this is not actually the universe we live in. The world we live in far far stranger than that. There are not 4, but 10? or maybe an infinite number of dimensions. Time is not linear, but more illusory. Zooming down into the most base levels of existence, we find not mechanical reactions, but "vibrations". There is a universality of a force that composes all things. The world of the physical and mental are one.

Today, if I had to label my believe it would fall somewhere between pantheism an panentheism. The psychedelic experiences I've had, as well as dreams, have given me first hand experience that we are tapped into something much larger than ourselves. I don't believe in the Judeo-Christian deity. I do believe that what we normally experience is only a tiny fraction of Existence. To be alive and conscious is to be Divine. We are co creators and experiencers of our own magnificence.

Is anyone else here an "ex-atheist"?  To me it seems like a natural progression to go from believing in the God in the Bible, to disbelief, to pantheism. </TEXT>

And this book [The Artist's Way](http://www.amazon.com/The-Artists-Way-Julia-Cameron/dp/1585421464) which is a workbook for tapping into your own creativity and to stop censoring yourself!

It sure seems like you are making that claim when you post a link to something that is clearly NOT about jews but about Israel and call it anti-semetic.

Like I said before, there are a few people on that sub who routinely turn criticism of Israel into anti-semtism. And I and others call them out on their racist bullshit.  But you are poisoning the well by pointing to the worst of the bunch and saying it is indicative of the majority.

 you know, like you're doing right now.

I'm not defending "thinly veiled antisemitism".  I'm defending the right of people to criticize Israel without being called racist (when they are actually not being racist).  It might seem like a tough distinction to make but it's really important to make that distinction. </TEXT>

BUT that does not mean that everyone on that sub who is critical of Israel is anti-semitic.  What if I told you that there are jews who are critical of Israel? Does that blow your mind?  I know you probably don't care about this because your agenda is just to make people on that sub look bad, but I think you are being disingenuous when you conflate anti-zionism with anti-semitism.

	<TEXT>  A quote from a speech he gave in 1938:

 I should much rather see reasonable agreement with the Arabs on the basis of living together in peace than the creation of a Jewish state. My awareness of the essential nature of Judaism resists the idea of a Jewish state with borders, an army, and a measure of temporal power, no matter how modest. I am afraid of the inner damage Judaism will sustainespecially from the development of a narrow nationalism within our own ranks, against which we have already had to fight strongly, even without a Jewish state. ... If external necessity should after all compel us to assume this burden, let us bear it with tact and patience.

Smart guy. </TEXT>

Nothing, that's my point.  You really can use your own definition of "superior" if you insist on using that term at all.  Why not make your definition include some of the things you think are good? </TEXT>

When will you learn that the actions of an individual is not necessary indicative of that entire group.  You can cherry pick examples of assholes all you want, and you can come here to read more examples of what you already believe.  Do you know how fucking ridiculously fucked up your sort of rhetoric is?  How about treating all people with respect regardless of their race or religion?  Do you know how many Jews there are that are against Zionism and speak out about it?  I know it's real easy to spout out your racist nonsense behind the anonymity of a computer screen, but would you say these things in public? Why not?

	<TEXT> How the heck do you figure that the ability to destroy one's own ecosystem is "superiority"?  As for "self-awareness" that is nearly impossible to define.

Try this on for size: superiority is a completely relative concept with no absolute definition.  It's just you saying "This is better than that" which translates to "I like this better than that."  Evolution does not give a shit about what you like better.  Complex does not equal better than simple.  The only metric of success you can use when talking about a lifeform is its ability to survive and proliferate, and by that metric, insects are surely doing better than we. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  And how much is it to fly a head of lettuce across the continent, or a crate of bananas across the ocean?

Transporting anything is associated with carbon emissions, yes.  But that's not the point and that isn't what causes the huge emissions of meat consumption.  It is combination of methane output of cows and deforestation to make grazing land.

  and what of the carbon cost of the fertilizer that their manure replaces? 

[Manure only makes about 5% of fertilizer.](http://appliedmythology.blogspot.com/2013/03/no-cows-dont-make-fertilizer.html)  This is a non issue.

 My point is that you cannot just take one part of modern society and blame it for all of the ills of modern society. 

No one is claiming that meat consumption is to blame for ALL the ills of modern society.  Rather, it's about 14 and 22 percent of a very challenging problem. (Not to even mention the other compelling arguments for eating a plant-based diet.) If we want to solve it, we need to break it down and figure out what we can change.  Eating less meat is part of that. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Edit: let me rephrase that.

You are right, air travel is an absolutely huge contributor to one's carbon footprint.

But Morrissey is right too.

[According to Scientific America](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-greenhouse-hamburger/):
The FAO report found that current production levels of meat contribute between 14 and 22 percent of the 36 billion tons of "CO2-equivalent" greenhouse gases the world produces every year. It turns out that producing half a pound of hamburger for someone's lunch a patty of meat the size of two decks of cards releases as much greenhouse gas into the atmosphere as driving a 3,000-pound car nearly 10 miles.

It's a fairly easy change to make with a huge impact, which is probably why he's touting it, but does it make up for the rest of the carbon emissions involved in his lifestyle? Probably not. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm travelling South America and I'm boarding a bus in Ecuador.  I have a plastic water bottle full of processed San Pedro cactus (which is a lot like Peyote, contains mescaline).  I also have some weed, which can also get you serious jail time in Ecuador.  As I'm waiting in line to board the bus, I notice a uniformed guard (perhaps a police officer?) searching people's bags before boarding.  I split off from my friend and walk around the corner where I down the San Pedro, not wanting it to go to waste, and put the weed in my sock under my foot....

Back at the bus, the guard is doing a really thorough job searching and it is taking quite a while.  By the time it is my turn I'm starting to feel the effects of the San Pedro kick in.  The guard asks me immediately to completely empty my bag.  I have a guitar, which he shakes, juggling balls, which he sniffs, and a little pipe which I've used to burn the herb that morning.  He examines the pipe for a long time, sniffing it, scraping tar with his finger, while my heart is pounding.  I mutter "para tobacco" as if that doesn't make me any more suspicious.  Finally he asks me to remove my shoes and it's all I can do to keep it together.  I step out of my my shoes and I'm now standing on top of the marijuana.  He shines a flashlight in my shoes and then finally, after what seemed like a half an hour search, tells me to get on the bus.

Needless to say, it was an interesting bus trip after that. </TEXT>
