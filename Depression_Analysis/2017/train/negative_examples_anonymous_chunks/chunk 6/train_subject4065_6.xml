	<TEXT> Not taking it as a put down, criticism is important.

1) it's a small state (Vermont) that I would do this in, so I feel like it's feasible to promote them internally and to visitors.

2) I own a number of premium local domain names that I would build sites on to promote all of the restaurants on (sites would have to be established first), and build relationships with other media outlets to promote them in exchange for online advertising.

3) I see the cost to the restaurants as that 12% (10% to the customer, 2% to the credit card company) with my 1% coming from the credit card. Yes, that's lower revenue for the credit card company, but in exchange for hopefully increased usage of the card.

Thoughts? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Credit Card that offers discounts at local businesses where I get a small cut. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-01-13 21:45:42 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi all,

I think I've seen others do this, but am finding it hard to find information on where to start.

To make a long story as short as possible, I'd like to start a business where I provide people with a credit card dedicated to local restaurants. If you use that card in one of the participating restaurants you get a small discount (let's say 10%, and in return the restaurant gets promoted through the program) and I would receive a small percentage of the transaction fee (1%).

Is this possible? Are there resources online on how to build this program with a credit card company?

Thanks for any assistance! </TEXT>

You don't just hire based on need, you have to look at the market. If a **proven** GM knocked on Ross' door and said "Give me the power, I'll give you a Super Bowl" he'd probably do it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have that feeling as well. Changing GMs like this, while keeping the coach, rarely works out. Look at the Browns, seems like every single year it's either the GM or the coach being fired.

You have to wonder how this sets up Philbin for next year. A GM may come in with a promise to keep Joe for at least a year, but you know he'll be heavily scrutinized, as will RT. So much for consistency. </TEXT>

For some reason people think you're supposed to walk away from the draft with a handful of top performers. That's just not reality. If 4 years after the draft you have 2-3 starters from it then it was a good draft. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not a lawyer, but this might help:

"Section 230 of the CDA specifically addresses the nature of information ownership by online users. The Section states that no provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.

Generally speaking, Section 230 protects website administrators from being held accountable for information posted by other users. The CDA is a federal initiative, which means that Section 230 trumps any state or local laws to the contrary."

From http://www.brand.com/review-sites.html

My work is entirely online. These threats happen. You could represent yourself and present this CDA. But again, I'm not a lawyer so do your due diligence.


Edit: Your site is being spammed by SEOs. They are commenting in order to leave links to their own websites. I highly recommend you turn off the ability of users to link. This will reduce the garbage on your site (thus making it better for your users) and reduce the threat of Google filtering it out of the search results (and then no one finds it). As an example, look at the link by "garbage disposal" on the front page currently, it links to a website. Don't allow that. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is probably the best article on the situation. I've defended Ireland in the past, and feel he does a very good job on the draft. This past off season, however, was a disaster. It's easy look back and say this (hindsight being 20/20), but Ireland should have known better. 

When was the last time a team made wholesale changes to their roster like we did? When has that worked? I remember the Redskins (maybe the 90s) making a number of changes and they won the Super Bowl, but they brought in proven and trusted vets, not a WR who was a bit of a diva, linebackers (don't get me wrong, I think Ellerbe and Wheeler are very good) and OLs who are still green.

This will continue to affect us. Next year won't be good either unless some leaders are brought in or miraculously emerge. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hmmm, yeah I see what you mean.

Did you use regular spray paint? If so, do you know the colors/brands? Maybe I'll pick up a used helmet and do this...just have it on display. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't have a helmet, nor a motorcycle. I just want to sit at my desk at work (I live in New England) and piss off all the Pats fans.

So, old or not...it looks sweet. Sell? </TEXT>
