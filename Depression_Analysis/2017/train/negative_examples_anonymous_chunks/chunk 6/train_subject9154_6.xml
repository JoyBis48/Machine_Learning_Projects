	<TEXT> 1920X 1080  but i never use this because it messes up trying to watch movies since it duplicates over to my tv screen. My TV is basically my monitor. 

When the resolution was high in the game I got the bad text. When I brought it down to 800X600 the text was fine and better.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well my monitor is connected to my 55inch 4k TV. I have an HP all in one 23inch monitor for my computer. 

I changed the resolution to 800X600 and everything seems fine now. 

I looked at screen resolution on the background of my desktop and it says 1024 by 768 so should i do that for the game too?  </TEXT>

This sniper was up on one of the pillars at Kelp Dome picking us off so, lol, I just went the long way around snuck up from behind and BAM. It's fun surprising people, it's why I like the Ink Mines. I always like running up to people and plopping it down for a suicide kill.  </TEXT>

And I played for like 10 hours once on a binge so I got A LOT of gold. I bought all the clothes. Don't know what else to do other than buy an amiibo to do those challenges. It's fairly easy to get lots of gold quick. There's nothing to spend it on so it keeps saving.  </TEXT>

12 Sea Snails is cool but what am I gonna do with them? I already have 500K gold, it's not like I need to talk to Spyke for anything.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Great. What is his proof besides "someone close to reddit?" Sorry man but you see lots of that stuff. It's all speculation. 

We don't deserve to know because it's not professional for a business to disclose why they fired an employee. It doesn't matter that we use the site and generate posts or not. That is irrelevant in the firing of an employee for a business. It sucks she got let go, was a big mistake by Reddit. But it is not our business to know why she was let go, it is our business on what they are doing to rectify the situation and their mistakes.  </TEXT>

Yeah, it's a shame the mods turned the community private, but so it goes.


It's not a shame some mods turned the community private. The shame isn't on the mods, it's on you guys. The responses you're giving back to people aren't positive it's just the same old BS. The firing of Victoria is not our business- I get that- we have no business to know why- just so you know, she was good at what she did and you will not find someone as good as her. 

I've been on reddit a while on this username and my others, but this has made me question quitting reddit. 

Again, it's not a shame the mods stood with solidarity over being treated poorly. Reading your official response, it's just so smug and arrogant. It's like you think you can easily appease people with that crap </TEXT>

fair is a veritable smorgasbord orgasbord orgasbord

After the crowds have ceased 

Each night when the lights go out

 It can be found on the ground all around 

Oh, what a ratly feast!

Melon rinds and bits of hotdogs 

Cookie crumbs and rotton cotton candy 

Melted ice cream, mustard dripplings

 Moldy goodies everywhere

Lots of popcorn, apple cores 

Bananna peels and soggy sadwiches 

And gobs of gorgeous gook to gobble at the fair

A fair is a veritable smorgasbord orgasbord orgasbord 

After the gates are shut 

Each night when the lights go out 

It can be found on the ground all around 

That's where a rat can glut, glut, glut, glut! </TEXT>
