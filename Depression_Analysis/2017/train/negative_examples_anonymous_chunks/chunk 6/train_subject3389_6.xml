	<TEXT> First, you are cherry picking. Oils outperformed the SPX in 2001-2011, but often lagged before and have definitely lagged since. 

Second, that was then. The global scientific community (all 97 national scientific academies, the UN IPCC, etc.) delivered the verdict on leaving most fossil fuels unburned only last year. The Saudi dumping of oil followed that announcement, not coincidentally. Meanwhile, coal stocks have been in decline for five years, and European utils are selling off their coal-fired generation businesses. This is no longer the *new* reality, but just the reality. </TEXT>

I've made this a cornerstone of my stock portfolio. Anyone else doing this? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> "First, the government should eliminate energy subsidies of all kinds  for fossil fuels as well as renewable energy."

A very false precondition. "The government" cannot level the playing field by eliminating fossil fuel subsidies, because the vast majority of them come from scores of *other* governments in developing countries; $550 billion annually. We would also have to eliminate much larger *indirect* subsidies such as public money for fossil fueled infrastructure such as highways, airports and utilities, not to mention the vast military costs of protecting oil fields and transport routes.

Fee-and-dividend carbon carbon taxes are beautiful things in themselves. However, until all the world's nations stop subsidizing fossil fuels, renewables will still need subsidies to compete. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ugh. If this blog lunatic had even *read* the Tyler Cowan article in question, rather than merely attacking its headline, he might have noticed its point: "Our more peaceful and  yes  more slacker-oriented world is in fact better than our economic measures acknowledge. Living in a largely peaceful world with 2 percent G.D.P. growth has some big advantages that you dont get with 4 percent growth and many more war deaths." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 1) Solar output peaks when much of demand does, during the afternoon air conditioning hours, so intermittency is less problematic than it may seem.

2) Battery storage costs are dropping quickly as well. For example, [this forecast](https://dqbasmyouzti2.cloudfront.net/assets/content/cache/made/content/images/articles/Storage_Cost_Drops_580_440.png) from three years ago actually *underestimates* the rate of improvement. 

3) While some think that solar or wind will be enough by themselves, most credible voices on the matter believe that we'll still need base-load generation from nuclear, biomass and the like. </TEXT>

After all, it takes many decades to really drain giant fields, future extraction technology will undoubtedly extend the life of those fields, and a global ban on burning oil is now inevitable, maybe even imminent. 

The only factor you haven't mentioned, and perhaps this qualifies as fresh thinking, is the degree to which the Saudi oil heartland is also the heart of the Kingdom's Shia population, and Sunni/Shia warfare is breaking out all over, so maybe the Saudis are also concerned about possible future national breakup and the loss of that territory. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  The climate changes during the pliocene are not well explained by carbon, it doesn't even account for a significant portion of the differential.

There is [little doubt](http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/v3/n1/full/ngeo724.html) that elevated carbon levels during the pliocene accounted for a significant portion of the higher temperatures and higher sea levels then. And that was merely one of [many such ancient episodes](http://www.whoi.edu/cms/files/zachos08nat_141144.pdf) that provide insights into what a high-carbon atmosphere does to life on Earth. And, in each of these episodes, the impacts to precipitation have been highly uneven, boosting extremes--drier here, wetter there--just as we now see developing.

We agree on the need for action, and on the need for credibility, but let's settle down with the knee-jerk attacks. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  See, there you go predicting doom if humans don't act soon to decarbonize. How can you be so certain of the stakes?

I'm not predicting anything. I'm simply paying attention to the united opinion of *all* of the world's major research bodies, which say we *must* decarbonize due to the extreme risks involved.

Here's an analogy: we now find ourselves playing Russian roulette, while forcing our children and grandchildren to play as well, all simultaneously, but we don't know with real certainty 1) how many bullets are in the guns, 2) at what part of our bodies the guns are aimed. We do know that, over the course of the next few decades, the number of bullets increases, as does the likelihood of the guns being aimed at our heads. Every decade is a pull of the triggers.

That makes the modest cost of decarbonization (0-2% GDP, net) an essential investment. </TEXT>

Look at the global cost of the Syrian drought right now. Needless to say, there is quite a range of possible costs, but any of them would be far greater than the modest cost of prevention. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 1) Very few "predict doom", because most believe that humanity will act soon to decarbonize. The stakes are simply too high not to.

2) The plea to decarbonize isn't coming from "a scientist" or "just *some* scientists"; this is the united judgement of the entire world scientific community, including endorsements from every one of the world's 97 national scientific academies, the UN IPCC, the World Bank, NASA and just about every other research authority one can name.

3) The fact that we don't know with certainty what to expect is exactly why these organizations and individual experts are all so concerned. Their position is that the likelihood of absolute catastrophe is too high to ignore, and growing higher as we dither, so the only reasonable action is to "buy insurance" by investing in decarbonization now. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's easy, because it has happened several times before and we have abundant evidence of the effects. 

For example, the [last time we had 400 ppm CO2](http://scienceblogs.com/significantfigures/index.php/2013/05/10/the-last-time-atmospheric-co2-was-at-400-parts-per-million-humans-didnt-exist/), as we now do, it led to sea levels more than 100 feet higher than today, global temperature 5F degrees higher than today, with large deserts in the North American Great Plains (complete with camels, no less). 

Let's just say that would now be highly inconvenient--except for the camels, which would be somewhat cool. Yet that was merely a moderate warming event, due to atmospheric carbon levels no higher than today's. [Much worse](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/348/6231/229.full) have occurred. </TEXT>

Acts 4:32-35 - "Now the full number of those who believed were of one heart and soul, and no one said that any of the things that belonged to him was his own, but they had everything in common. And with great power the apostles were giving their testimony to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and great grace was upon them all. There was not a needy person among them, for as many as were owners of lands or houses sold them and brought the proceeds of what was sold and laid it at the apostles' feet, and it was distributed to each as any had need." 

Luke 16:19-31 - There was a rich man who was clothed in purple and fine linen and who feasted sumptuously every day. And at his gate was laid a poor man named Lazarus, covered with sores, who desired to be fed with what fell from the rich man's table. Moreover, even the dogs came and licked his sores. The poor man died and was carried by the angels to Abraham's side. The rich man also died and was buried, and in Hades, being in torment, he lifted up his eyes and saw Abraham far off and Lazarus at his side."

	<TEXT> Meanwhile, low-cost oil producers like Saudi Arabia have responded by dumping their oil on the world market at half price, to unload their reserves before burning oil is outlawed and to delay the cost effectiveness of renewables.

That's the problem with fossil fuels: selfish-bastard nations with abundant fuel reserves can always undercut renewables if they choose, going by the logic that its better to sell those reserves now at low price than to see them stranded by the coming global bans.

The only solution is to ban these fuels sooner rather than later. The free market will *not* help. </TEXT>
