	<TEXT> I had dealings with Ray White about 18 months ago. It wasn't a pleasant experience and I would recommend them.

Since then, a man named Jason Voglis from the agency has not stopped calling me and emailing me with sales calls and spam. 

I tried calling his boss AND Ray White head office but nothing much seems to happen. 

EDIT: Had a call from his boss today saying I should have been taken off the list and that he couldn't explain what was going on. I rattled off everything you guys had mentioned below. He seem a bit rattled. Hopefully that's it. 

EDIT 2: Nope. Wasn't it. Still got more emails.

Any thoughts how I can stop this guy?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> With a lot of music, the words themselves don't require literal meaning. Instead it's how they *sound* that gives the song meaning or emotion.

A lot of hip hop is best compared to nonsense verse like Edward Lear and Lewis Carroll or even the experimental works of James Joyce. "

All mimsy were the borogoves / and the mome raths outgrabe." in Jabberwocky doesn't make a lot of sense but sounds great just like "scooby snack jurassic plastic gas booby trap" doesn't mean a damn thing when Ghostface Killah raps it.

In hop hop, the focus is often on the rhythm and lyricism of the words, not what they are saying. I would imagine the trend comes from freestyle rap where in order to keep up with the beat, the rapper drops in nonsense words or words that make no sense in that context.

TL;DR - "The sound of the words is more important than the meaning" said the whitest man ever.

There is currently a trend towards plain suits in magic. Trouble is, it makes them all look like bankers   lawyers and, in the eyes of bookers, interchangeable.

Also, while I am a magician, I specialise in a very specific area of magic and would like to stand out.

David Blaine is less interesting today because now we have so many people just like him. However, so many of those performers owe him and Paul Zenon (the man who introduced street magic to the UK) a debt.

Not a fan of Criss Angel. He uses camera tricks and stooges. I prefer guys like David Kwong and Justin Flom. Check out Wizard Wars. By buddy Rick created it.

Penn and Teller and amazing. The Amazing Jonathan also. I am none of them. I have Jonathan's beard, Penn's physique and teller's hairline.

	<TEXT> Thanks, that was brilliant. 

I struggle to find quality designers for my sites. The last great site I had was eight years ago and that company was bought out my a larger operation and their prices increased by 500%. Now, i'm stuck trying to find a good designer who can help me with what I want.

I feel like the only choices I have is to pay $2000-$3000 for a site that isn't what I want or $9 per month for a site that isn't amazing but that I can, at the very least, fiddle with until it limps into usable. 

It's a problem that others in my industry face with many designer their own sites. The two guys I know with great sites by great developers got mates rates from a friend.

	<TEXT> What about the templates are unprofessional? As a non-designer, I can see sites I do and don't like but I'm not sure what makes them unprofessional.

I have several people in my market with wix sites on the front page of google who've done only basic SEO. I've done a little reading on Ajax crawling and it seems to get the job done.

I've seen terribly designed wordpress sites, many using templates, made by amateurs out of their depth who just don't understand WP's complexities. 

What about a WP site helps non-designers make their own sites easier than wix?

	<TEXT> Wix seems to get a lot of hate here. As a non-designer, I struggle to nail people down on EXACTLY what is bad about the site.

For me, the big downside is that anyone can make their own site, which means people who don't know design end up with a dull template OR a design of their own that stinks.

It puts web design in the hands of people who have no business designing sites.

However, if a user has a keen eye for design and doesn't need to complex a site, what is the problem with using Wix?

EDIT: I think I have a better understanding now of the problems a designers have with. Broadly speaking, I see a lot of parallels between this issue and publishing/self-publishing. A lot of publishers get very annoyed with self-published books. The quality is low, they are packed full of mistakes and they price traditional publishers out of the business. However, publishers have had to learn to suck it up and learn to live in a DIY world. Perhaps web designers will too.

	<TEXT> I figured out the the big difference between Australian and American coffee, aside from the style, was the strength. Often, I'd dismiss coffee as being bad when, in reality, it was just week. 

My favourite coffee experience of the trip was at service station half way between LA and Vegas where they had 10 different pots of coffee on the boil, twelve different syrups, six different types of "milk", four types of sweetener and a selection of whipped creams, sprinkles, chocolate etc. 

It summed up the American experience for me. It's a country founded on choice, where they'd rather have a thousand terrible choices than two or three good ones. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Australians have a rep for being picky (i.e. assholes) when it comes to coffee. 

While I was in New York I tried to find the best coffee place I could. Some hipsters recommended this little hole in the wall near Chelsea Market. Just a counter, a coffee machine and beans. 

The Barista was a massive douche to every single person in line. Soup Nazi levels. 

When we got to the front of the line and he heard our accents his face went white.

"You Australians?"
"Yep."
"From Melbourne?"
"Uh-huh"
"Ok...well...I'll do my best OK?"

	<TEXT> Of course, there are several vaguely unsatisfying theories about how he escaped.

1) Few pantries can be locked from the outside. There is a handle on the door. He could have simply let himself out.

2) The axe. We never see where the axe came from. Perhaps he found it in the room.

3) He never escaped. He froze to death in the unheated room and the chase through the maze was his crazed mind created a reason for the lowering temperature.

4) Danny let him out and he knew the maze well enough to get in and out, leaving Jack stuck in the middle. He wanted to kill Jack.
