Seen a lot looking like this in NYC. They look tacky and sad, but I wouldn't be surprised if stance kids and hipsters start thinking this looks good in a few years. With the cost of running an old S class, I wonder how there can be so many like this. I still see some nice looking ones driven by older people in wealthier areas though. </TEXT>

Which is why I wonder why so many people like W123s and W126s so much. That's the basic description of those old Benzes, yet there seem to be far more people who still desire or feel nostalgic for those cars. I actually like these MBs and the type of U.S. cars that are seen in these ads. The difference must be the availability of diesel, manual, and better build quality. </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2015-05-23 02:19:54 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> If self-driving cars become a popular mode of transportation, will some places just have to stick only to manually driven ones? I thought of this when I was thinking about my vacation to the Bahamas last year. This is a place where the roads are terrible, the rust is extreme, and there probably wouldn't be any easy way to fix one. The roads aren't well maintained and generally don't have any markings on them, the salty island air and heat makes cars rust and malfunction very quickly, and there aren't many people outside of Nassau, the largest city, who can fix cars or electronics. Because of this, the only European luxury cars you see are older models that have been junked, and the SDCs must be even more complex. I could just see a self driving car down there being a travesty that only a rich masochist would try. In less than a year, it will rust, then the electronics and mechanicals will be shot, the road conditions will ruin the undercarriage, and when it breaks you'll have to have it shipped for service unless you live on the main island.

Edit: Most of the people are also relatively poor, but these would still be issues if they made more money or these cars became cheaper. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The V6 equipped Impala now gets 29 highway MPG and is lighter than an old Caprice. Even if this example has downsized from its older counterpart, 29 highway in a full size sedan with a V6 sounds extremely impressive. Also, don't forget about hybrids and electric cars. Efficiency has improved, but I see your point. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sure, they may save lives, but is that necessarily a good thing? More lives saved by self driving cars means more people around to pollute and use resources. Think about this, if 1.2 million people die of traffic fatalities, that will eliminate an amount of co2 emissions equivalent to that of a city and save a large forest because they won't be alive anymore to use electricity, oil, or paper. They will also aid in making the world more crowded.
