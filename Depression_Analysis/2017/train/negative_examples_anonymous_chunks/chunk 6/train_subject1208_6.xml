	<TEXT> There are a few German military dog breeders that are still in operation after being started by the Nazi's. IIRC they still breed shepherds with grey wolves every 18th generation to create new lines that don't have any of the problems the breed suffers from today.

My uncle has one of the breeder's dogs that were rejected by the military. Not sure how much he bought him for, he won't say, but he gets well over $500 from studding him out. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Former TV news presenter here. She deserves more than props. Karl throws her a segment ahead of time and she goes straight into it and delivers her lines straight into the camera, with only a brief glance at her script, before realizing the teleprompter is showing the script for different segment.

To break down the skill that involves: she's got her lede lines memorized, the composure to deliver them at any given moment without tipping the audience off, and the awareness to be reading the teleprompter, which would be showing Celeb Buzz's script, while delivering completely different lines.

There's a reason I'm a former TV presenter.... shit's HARD. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> How did the invention of the Bermuda Rig in the 17th Century change the course of shipping, trade, and naval war? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-06-17 19:10:54 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> My home of Bermuda is famous for a few things: shorts, that 2spooky4me eponymous triangle, and tax avoidance. But the biggest mark our tiny archipelago has made in the history books can be found in every marina across the globe: [the Bermuda Rig.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bermuda_rig)

The rigging allowed us, and subsequently the world, to sail upwind with precision around the reefs that claimed so many ships in years gone by. The design was so transformative, within a few decades of its popularisation, King Charles II would soon be sailing one. 

A poem published by John H. Hardie in 1671 described Bermuda's boats such: 

 With tripple corner'd Sayls they always float, 
 About the Islands, in the world there are, 
 None in all points that may with them compare.

I've always been curious to know what the wider implications of the Bermuda Rig were in the world of sailing, beyond piracy and competition. Did the ability to sail upwind alter shipping routes, or naval war strategy?

I'd love to learn more about my island's sailing heritage, especially with the America's Cup World Series coming to our shores this October. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Can't say I've ever encountered a girl that likes assaulting people, then specifically gets defensive when she gets assaulted back. You've met so many of these women, you can say confidently they're 1 in 15? Wow. You must come from a pretty shitty place if that's how people act. </TEXT>

Whether it's the Swedish stylings Gyllene Tider's '[Sommartider](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beFPoiNn0Bs)', or Righeria's impossibly contagious '[Vamos a la Playa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTsVJ1PsnMs)', my love for cheesy 80's summer hits knows no bounds.

What are some of your all time favourite 80's summer tunes?
