	<TEXT> The star passed through the Oort cloud at a distance of about 51,000 astronomical units (A.U.) from our Sun, very far beyond Neptune's orbit. Neptune is only 30 A.U. from the Sun (Earth is 1 A.U. from the Sun).  That huge separation combined with the star's small mass translates to its gravity having a negligible effect on Neptune's orbit. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes, but it is rarely a pristine reflection so the reflected signal does not completely cancel but usually partially cancels the primary signal. Also there are usually many signals from several reflection sources so the cancellation is highly position dependent and it gets complicated very quickly.   

WiFi is usually a 2.4 or 5 GHz RF signal so it bounces off of anything that conducts, like metal used in building materials.  It can also partially reflect off of and be partially absorbed by other surfaces like walls, floors, ceilings and objects in homes.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The low signal areas are generally caused by a combination of 1) blockage of the WiFi signal by materials that attenuate or reflect the signal and 2) partial/full cancellation by the WiFi signal as it destructively interferes with a reflected version of itself or other RF sources. 

Predicting the RF pattern caused by the many attenuation, reflection and interference sources in a home is a very difficult thing to do, which is why measurement is appealing.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The graphic shows planets (one dot per planet) discovered over time, initially in 5 year increments and later in 1 year increments when the discovery rate picks up.  The vertical axis is the planet's mass relative to the Earth's mass and the horizontal axis is the time it takes the planet to make one orbit around its star (i.e. the planet's year) relative to an Earth year.  The initial discoveries (dark blue dots) are planets within our solar system and the later discoveries are outside of our solar system.

	<TEXT> Yeah, they reported an avionics issue earlier and it's not clear it was resolved when the range tracking issue was reported.  But they clearly cited the range tracking issue as the reason for the abort.  Hopefully we'll hear more on this. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Summary from Wikipedia: L1, L2 and L3 are normally unstable but semi-stable halo (or Lissajous) orbits around the Lagrangian points do exist.  Since these are not perfectly stable, small amounts of thrust for station keeping are required to maintain these orbits over long periods. For most spacecraft, the preferred amplitude of the Lissajous orbit around Earth-Sun L1 is 62,000 to 124,000 miles.  This keeps the spacecraft off the direct line between the Sun and Earth and reduces solar interference when antennas on Earth are directed at the spacecraft for communication.  

I assume that since since spacecraft near L1 follow fairly sizable orbits around the point, there is plenty of room for many spacecraft to occupy those orbits. 

Answer to bonus question: Either "Lagrange point" or "Lagrangian point" are correct, but Lagrange is directed to Lagrangian in Wikipedia.
