	<TEXT> As a qualified electrician and lighting technician for film and television working on the likes of Dr. Who and such. I have to remind you that not all MCB's have the same breaking capacity and its' not just the MCB that dictates what can be run on a single circuit but the gauge and the type of the wiring used. Yes what you have said is typical of a standard 1mm lighting circuit but not a standard ring main used for power or anything else for that matter. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think I can simplify a lot of these answers. A wise friend once told me when I questioned him on his feelings of death and what he felt about dying. He simply said "Can you remember before being born and do you ever care about that? Death can be seen as the same" Made me feel better at the time and truth be told, surprisingly, I don't worry so much as before just hearing that one sentence.  </TEXT>
