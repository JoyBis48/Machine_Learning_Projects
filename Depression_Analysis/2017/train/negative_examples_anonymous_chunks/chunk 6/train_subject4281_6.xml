	<TITLE> I have a Bachelor's degree in Business and two years at a relevant job out of college. What is the most efficient career (not investment) path to obtain as high an income as possible? I'm willing to entertain everything from Lawyer to Oil Rigs. </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Main thing though is that my adjusted hourly rate needs to be as high as possible... i.e. I decided against law because I'd be working insane hours for the same salary I make now in 40 hours A week.

If I'm only in it for the money, and I'll pay whatever tuition it takes, what field of study should I go into for grad school to make a 6 figure income in the next 5 to 10 years almost assuredly, while working less than 50 hours a week? 

I've already ruled out medicine and law due to time sinks and opportunity cost.

What about software engineering?

I'd also really like to live out west.

	<TEXT> If you are on the fence about going to law school you probably shouldn't. 

I'm on the fence because I literally just started thinking about it as a possibility the other day.

I took some LSAT practice quizzes and did pretty well, drawing out the logical problems and solving them is second nature to me. Is there a timed one you recommend?

	<TEXT> We will own robots and take out a mortgage on them similar to how we have homes that take 30 years to pay off and most who didn't have special skills would run small robot staffing businesses (i.e. a family would own a robot) and then sell its services to a local business (i.e. mcdonalds) at a contracted rate.

instead of working a job the family would research new technologies repair and perform maintenance and save up to buy more robots.

	<TEXT> Are all 100k+ lawyers working 60+ hours a week? My job is stressful now but over petty things like getting yelled at for making minor  mistakes on a three week project we had 1 day to finish, etc. 

Can you give me an example of something that would stress a lawyer out?

I wouldn't necessarily mind long hours if I enjoyed the job. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's a good point. I was throwing around software engineering as well but I think I'd find law more fulfilling.

	<TEXT> .... that's really depressing then. I hate my job. 

I thought new lawyers made 60+ To start?

I make over 60 when you include my other income but I'd still be making that if I quit as its Army/Rental income (full occupancy = about 75).

This would continue if I became a lawyer obviously so that decreases my OC. I might have to sell my house though if I moved too far away to maintain/landlord it.

My office job for what it pays is not worth the stress of being the whipping boy at the intersection of two dysfunctional departments. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm interested in law because I'm extremely analytical. I've always stood out well above others at any analytical task. I also want a job that will pay a 100k salary, even if it means going into a lot of debt to do so.

That being said, it seems like my best bet is to work my ass off to get into a T14. How difficult is that?

I think my cumulative UGPA was around 3.6 or something, if you include classes from the community college I transferred from to my 4 year. GPA is about 3.7 if you only look at the 4 year.

My degree is in Business Management, I also have about 6 years in the Army Reserve (still in, do I get some type of affirmative action bonus for military status)?

Assuming I got a good LSAT score, how hard is it to get into a T14? I'm not worried about scholarships, I will borrow the full bill if I got accepted as it seems T14 is a license to print money if you make it through.

I currently make about $48k at a crappy office job I got right after college. (I graduated 2 years ago). I have almost no student loan debt, so I'm wondering what my opportunity cost will be to go to law school, and what kind of salary I can expect starting if I graduate from a T14 and place middle of the road in the class.

EDIT: I live near U of M, and they appear to be a high ranking school. Would I have a shot there? What kind of salaries do they see starting? I could literally go there with free rent as I have family in the area.  </TEXT>
