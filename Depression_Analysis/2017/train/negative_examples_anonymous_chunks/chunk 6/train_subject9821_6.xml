	<TEXT> Its pointless in the fact it, residuals, have no effect on why they would continue making movies after sucessfull ones. Your first reply was a technicality in this reference frame.





Your second was to confirm opinion on most actors receiving residuals which was to my comment most actors do not. Taking into effect all the extras small roles, etc in tv film and independent, it is more reasonable to assume that most do not. This also irrelavant imo.




Again if residuals is a small sum, it would have no effect on the topic at hand. I feel instead of trying to catch me on a technicality, which has no real bearing on the topic, just make your own post that goes directly to OP, so imo unproductive as we are literally back to where we started, but to each his own.




Furthermore my example, were you aware beforehand if the Godfather was a union shoot? </TEXT>

The point to the OP is just because your movie makes a billion dollars doesnt mean you become a billionare, ie you make a few good movies doesnt mean you stop working. You are hanging on a technicality, a weak one, and its unproductive to the topic at hand. </TEXT>

2.Power of the script




3.You dont have to spell everything out to the auidence. Its about a bank robbery you never actually see

Bad movies usually will overpay big names to get people to watch the movie. Sometimes sucessful actors try to expand their horizon and try new genres they are unfamilar with and pick a shiity movie in their ignorance. Actors could sign on to a movie with a great script and the director bombs. In jack and jill maybe it was a favor to sandler </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Fair enough. I could give a couple reasons for you but mostly system is flawed.





1 Ever get fired as a head coach and take a new offer else where? When you do your upcoming free agents are all unhappy(w/e it is they say when a player rejects your contract and cant be offered another one). So to say the computer rarely offers big money to these players, and replaces them with new ones, there are exceptions dealing with age and pos. Also notice some of the biggest FAs can be picked up on one year deals after the draft, first FAs group after




2.When you start moving picks around, teams are more likely to use those picks to fill needs as opposed to FA, and also teams take this into account with expiring contracts




3.All contracts in madden are front loaded. Meaning the later years of the contract is when you pay the most money so the first 3-4 years can be a breeze cap wise before a clean house process is forced and does happen </TEXT>

Every read the simalirillion, or any tolkien(ties into string theory)? Well anyway tolkiens middle earth universe is created by music, ie vibrations. Very similar to string theory and this book was written like 70 years ago </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yea we all do. But the exploits are a ton less than they use to be is my point. You use to be able to switch a 99ovr qbs' position to a 65ovr db during the signing process, and sign the qb for nothing then switch him back, etc 




Im not concerned about your team, im answering your question about the cap </TEXT>

He was obssesed with colors at one point. He was using a prism to experiment with light. White light goes in, rainbow colored lights come out. He made the assumption that the prism acted as a separator of white light. So effectively saying white light was a combination of all colors.

The trade/contract system is flawed but nowhere near as bad as before. 5 years ago it was so much worse </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think that the reason Chris is such an exceptional debater is because he was around someone 24/7 that could dish it back for most of his early life. He implies that during the debate.




Check it out tell me what you think.




When they get to the topic of the existance of God chris starts with, "Well i dont need 10 minutes to disprove God!". Classic. Whatever side you are on, gotta crack a smile, classic Hitch. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree with C hitchens for most of this debate, including his iraq war stance. But its not really a massacre, Peter hitchens is a bright dude, just as brillant as Chris imo but is literally polar opposite of chris, and i favor chris so i like him more. One of the best, maybe The best debate, ive ever seen, and i watch a ton of debates. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Drug addiction to certain drugs is deadly. Take heroin, a long time users' body will create a dependency so strong it can kill you if you stop cold turkey, unlike chocolate. In severe cases methadone is prescribed to a herion addict to ween them off the drug slowly and safely, never heard of that with chocalate fienes.




Yes in most cases its psycological OP, but certain drugs can cause a dependency in your body so severe your body can go into shock and shutdown. </TEXT>
