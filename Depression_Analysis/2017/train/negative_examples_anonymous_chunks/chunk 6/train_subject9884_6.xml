I have found this where it is described as an issue that sometimes occurs. Not sure why people would not be happy about it.

	<TEXT> Well, its doesn't actually use up the 5.9 GB. It just downloads all the files that have to be replaced on your current OS. Then, after you have downloaded it, the files on your OS will be deleted and replaced by the new "updated" ones. This way the update initially needs 5.9GB to save to files that were downloaded, but afterwards, you only end of with however much code they added, which is probably not going to be anywhere near 5.9GB. 

But, yes, if you do not have the 5.9GB available on your phone at the time, do it like you said. If you do have the space available, it makes no difference. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Its a 12 day thing:

* Day 1 thread: post the name of a country you would like to see in the contest. Top 10 countries compete

* Day 2 - 11 threads: Each day there will be a thread for one of the top 10 countries. In that thread people can post their favourite songs from that country. Top comment will represent that country in the final stage.

* Day 12 thread: There will only be 10 comments in that thread, all the songs from the past 10 days. Top comment/song wins!

I think it would be fund and would give all of us the opportunity to listen to good songs from certain countries. 

I hope this will work. Of course the rules can be adjusted.  </TEXT>

It is causing damage to the environment and humans. 

Edit: Some articles to support my claim:

[Financial damage is about 13 billion per year cause by plastic waste] (http://www.unep.org/newscentre/default.aspx?DocumentID=2791 ArticleID=10903)

[Here is what happens to animals that mistake plastic for food](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAL9Xvrg3hI)

[Plastic releases a substance called Bisphenol A that is suspected to cause cancer](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/01/080130092108.htm)

[Our planet (especially the oceans) are full of plastic and it does not bio degrade, which means it's not going to go anywhere](http://www.plasticoceans.net/)

	<TEXT> None of those will make you happy if you ask me. 

It's the same with men too. If you're looking for a longterm relationship you need somebody who is selfless, positive, independent, has their own friends and is not lazy. You can't live with a person who constantly complains, never does any work at home, is always sad when you do something by yourself and puts herself first no matter how funny or good looking she is. 

However if you have somebody who loves you, wants you to be happy, is going to do their fair share of work, lifts you up and let's you be yourself, she does not have to be beautiful of super funny but I guarantee you'll still be happy with her. 

Edit: If you're in it for the short term, then I agree with you 100% </TEXT>

	<TEXT> /u/nasebanaru pointed out that there is a wiki article stating how often Japan has apologised in the past. 

However in that same article there is a section "Controversy" which pretty much explains why this is not jet settled. This sums it up nicely:

Criticisms regarding the degree and formality of apology, issued as a statement or delivered person-to-person to the country addressed, and the perception by some that some apologies are later retracted or contradicted by statements or actions of Japan, among others.

	<TEXT> And my children will watch it too. For that exact reason. 

I believe Jack and Daniel together are perfect and need each other. As much as Daniel has perfect morals and ethics, he so often needed Jack to decide how to go about things. Because perfect morals only work in a perfect world. Jack was the realist who made sure to achieve the best, most ethical outcome considering the actual situation they were facing. He always understood Daniel and I believe always agreed with him. But he always pretended to disagreed with Daniel when he had to make difficult decisions. To Daniel it looked like Jack didn't understand but in fact he was protecting Daniel's unshakable faith in the good by taking the responsibility for the sacrifices they had to make.

	<TEXT> Well, I disagree. I am more likely to hire somebody who knows his weakness and will be mindful about it than somebody who thinks he is the boss and can't do any wrong. People like that are horrible to work with and don't want to learn. People who recognize they are not perfect and know where they need to improve are far better and will use more of their potential. 

Edit: Actually this attitude of yours is the reason people won't disclose their weaknesses. </TEXT>

If you are buying shit full price you are an idiot. Well, to be honest it is good for me, but all these companies are undermining their credibility by always selling everything half price.

	<TEXT> Well, I have no analysis. If that is how it works, then the movies is doing it right. I have no proof or argument. I understand your explanation and can understand what you mean. 

So in your mind he is travelling to a time that co-exists with the time you are remaining in, right? He is in the future, you are in the past but both of you exist at the same time, right?

In my mind, there is only "one time". Imagine it as a piece of string. 

--------------------A----------------B-------------------C--------------------

At any given point (A, B or C) in time everybody can be somewhere in space (3 dimensional space) e.g. London, Chicago, etc. Everybody can freely move in that space, but cannot move freely along the string. Everybody moves from A to B to C at the same speed, 1 minute per minute (if that makes sense). Now what the time machine allows the traveler to to is to:

a) travel backwards and forwards

b) travel at different speeds

However, whilst it is traveling through time, it does not travel through space (it remains in London). 

Now from my point of view, whenever two people are at the same point in time and space, they should be able to see each other. That means, when the traveler decides to travel from 8am on 1st Jan 1910 to 8am 1st Jan 1911 and we meet in London at that time, I will of course be able to see him, because we are at the same time at the same place. The only difference is that for me 1 year went by and for the traveler less time went by (however fast he was traveling). 

Now normally we assume that a time machine has to move fast to start the time travel (like in back to the future). When the Delorean starts his journey, he goes really fast before time travel starts. However he also moves in space which is why you cannot see him during time travel. You can only see him again, when he comes back to that same place that he has left from. 

But in The Time Machine the machine does not move in space whilst it is time traveling. I am sure you will agree with my example above where I said (*"That means, when the traveler decides to travel from 8am on 1st Jan 1910 to 8am 1st Jan 1911 and we meet in London at that time, I will of course be able to see him, because we are at the same time at the same place. The only difference is that for me 1 year went by and for the traveler less time went by (however fast he was traveling"*). But everything that traveling from 8am 1st Jan 1910 to 8am 1st Jan 1911 means is to travel from 8am 1st Jan 1910 to 8:00:01am to 8:0:02am to 8:00:03 am and so on, just faster than everybody else. So at each of these points you and the traveler are at the same place at the same time, just that he got there quicker than you. And being at the same place at the same time means, you can see each other.

This is as good as I can explain it.  </TEXT>
