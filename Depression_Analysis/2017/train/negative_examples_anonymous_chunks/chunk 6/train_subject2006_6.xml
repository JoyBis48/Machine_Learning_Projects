	<TEXT> She's probably thinking you're the oblivious one, op. 

Talking ad nauseum about another guy is probably an attempt at gently letting you know that she is not interested in you romantically. She likes you enough to not reject you outright, and is hoping you get the hint.

EDIT: To be clear, I am not endorsing this behavior - just pointing out her possible motivations.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This! I've been on birth control since I was 15 to control my periods - I definitely was not sexually active until much later. Even if she is using it for its intended purpose though, be happy that she is proactive in her own health and that she trusts you enough to be involved! 

Make sure she knows the importance of taking the pill regularly and at the same time as it can affect efficacy. And that it doesn't prevent STDs - there's a lot of really bad information floating out there. Knowledge is her (and your) best friend. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That would be awesome but no de-contamination chamber. In the most general sense, "closed" just means that it is only accessible to library staff and the public can't browse the shelves. Closed or not most libraries try to have climate control, as extreme temperatures, humidity, etc. are awful for conservation. This becomes more important for rare books/manuscript libraries.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Also the light is a big issue. If it were up to librarians, there wouldn't be any windows in libraries at all. Take for example [Herman B Wells Library](https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/u8bS2__uK8-jaeX1AM4xxg) at Indiana University at Bloomington. It was designed without windows because it was intended as a closed stacks library - meaning patrons would have to ask library staff to retrieve a book for you. This quickly didn't happen because most students wanted to be able to browse the stacks. So, they opened it up, but still no windows. Almost every rare book/manuscript library will be closed stacks though, and I find many European/British research libraries tend to follow this model as well.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This will likely get buried but it's a pretty bizarre story:

While I was in middle school and high school, my family lived in Japan as a result of my dad's job with an American based company that transferred him there. My mom, brother, and I were in the United States for one summer and had taken a trip to Cedar Point in Sandusky, OH - not our home town. It was a hot day and we took a break to sip some beverages on some "jungle cruise" type attraction. The host of the ride was engaging the passengers and asked where everyone was from. It came round to us and we said our city in Japan. The guy in front of us then turns around, and says, "Oh, are you with BlankCompany?" Which was correct, and odd as most people assumed military. My mother affirmatively; he then asked our last name. She then, somewhat hesitatingly replied. He then asks, "Where's Librarnox'sDad'sFirstname." After we got over the shocked silence, we find out that this was the guy who had been doing our taxes for the last 5 years. My mom knew his name from paperwork, but had never actually met him IRL. To add another layer, he wasn't from Sandusky either, I think he was from Pittsburgh or something.

Oh, and just the other week, my soccer coach from Japan showed up randomly to an event at my place of business - in the mid-western United States... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In an otherwise great show, they have a scene in *Orange is the New Black * when Pennsatucky gets picked up by a super-right-wing/Christian law firm and she walks into the court room, there are people with signs, cheering, etc. Would not happen in a court room. Though strangely enough *My Cousin Vinny* has some of the most accurate representation of court room procedure! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Level 5 and 9 are low enough that it wouldn't take terribly long to get back up there quickly if you just want to start a new character. You could play a new Siren - you're fully up on the skill trees and what works well. If you want something more long range, Zer0 is good, but I find that he works best when paired with another character. Axton's turret is bonkers, and can be used to good effect - much more in the thick of things. And I do have to put a good word in for Salvador - he is fun as hell to play. But I always love berserkers :) </TEXT>
