	<TEXT> PoliSci, plan was law school. Worked at a law firm, then later at the court. Dragged my feet for years, and since the legal field is dying somethin' fierce, I decided to go into healthcare which I'm pursuing right now. What are you thinking of doing? Criminal Justice field? Legal field? If the latter, I would advice you to be practical and look into it and be 100% it's what you want, because law school is not a good investment anymore. Back in the day (say before 2006ish) there were many well paying jobs out of school. Now, even people out of Ivy league schools in the top 10% of their classes are struggling. Partnerships in law firms are diminished. Plus, keep in mind something 90% of lawyers don't see a courtroom. They're in the office 12/hours a day doing paperwork. 

I think choosing something that will get you a well paying job out of school is the best route to go, regardless of what you want to do after your undergrad, be it law or something else. So if you did engineering, accounting, nursing, computer science, etc something practical like that, you'd still have  something to fall back on.
