	<TEXT> That's fair, but isn't there a difference between proving yourself 2-4 years in college and perhaps just 2-4 fights on the regional fight circuit?

I'm all for fighters making more money, but to me, the argument is more persuasive when talking about fighters who have been with the UFC for a while and serve a purpose -- while not champions, they are solid performers, gatekeepers, or even gatekeepers to gatekeepers.

20/20 for first time UFC'ers with marginal experience seems like a lot to ask, no?

Tennis players/golf players don't make $$ unless they win.. is that analogy too far off? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> But NFL teams make so much more money than the UFC. Also NFL players have proven themselves in college.

At a certain point its just economics. The UFC pays out a percentage to their fighters and a disproportionate amount goes to a) fighters who win b) fighters who can generate viewership and c) fighters who perform well in the cage i.e performance of the night.

Is that really that unfair?

	<TEXT> Am I nuts for thinking an unproven fighter on an undercard that brings in no revenue or fans has a right to earn 20/20 ? Just seems like a union would be more sensible than a lawsuit alleging that the UFC is a monopoly.. Look at what happened to affliction and their ridiculous payouts. Folded. Fighters are contractors who can determine how much they make based on performance. It's high risk high reward. That's the nature of the business </TEXT>

He once got super pissed off at me in gym class playing basketball when i blocked the shit out of one of his shots.. i was a nerd who was even shorter than him so hence the anger.

Supposedly, i heard from a friend, that in HS he once said that if he goes to hollywood and struggles and doesn't get his first commercial/break until he's 80, it would still be worth it.  Guess you can say he had a goal and was dead serious about it </TEXT>
