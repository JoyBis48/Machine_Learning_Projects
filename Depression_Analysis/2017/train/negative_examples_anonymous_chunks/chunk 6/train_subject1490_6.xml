	<TEXT> I am the Dank Lord, Lord of Dank, and I sit at the top of the throne with my gold and silver laurel of hempen leaves and a regal emerald cloak with brilliant ermine trim and silver lining.

At the foot of my throne are my two most loyal protectors, the great and formidable knights Sir Maxime Le Bouclier, Royal Aegis to the Hempen King, and Sir Eric Faucille, The Righteous Eradicator. Both are inhumanly large and wear highly ornate steel armour in the style of late 15th century German Gothic plate. 

As you may have guessed, they fight along side one another as a defender and aggressor, respectively. Sir Maxime bears a great bell mace and gigantic greatshield carved with all of the dope conquests of the Dank Lord, while Sir Eric wields a huge (15') halberd with a intricately carved axe blade on the top bearing the shape of a great hemp leaf. Both bear the kingdoms crest, a golden hemp leaf created using only the most sacred of geometry, upon their jet black tunics.

Beneath them is the Divine Cleric Aitor Laux, the greatest magic healer and sacred summoner in the kingdom. Very little possess magic, and he has been trained from a young age by members of the royal court to only use his magic for the good of the kingdom and his fellow subjects. He does not wear robes because even magic users find plate armour too dank to resist in my kingdom. 

Finally, we get to the main army. At the top is General Staffan Auriculaire, who is at the forefront of leading the Royal Aurian Knights into battle. His right hand man is known only as Sigha, and is one of the most deadly assassins in the realm. He is not known to make appearances on the battleground, but will oft be found alone and outnumbered deep within enemy territory, only to return intact and with his mission carried out. He is one of very few in the Royal Order exempt from wearing the standard royal plate armour, opting instead for tight fitting and dark armour of fine shadowmail, doing little to impede body movement while still offering great protection and camouflage. 

The Royal Aurian Knights are an order of dank knights recruited from every corner of the kingdom. In addition to the standard plate armour and kite shield, the lower ranking knights wear a great helm and carry maces, pikes, axes, and bows. The higher ranking knights wear an ornate bassinet helmet and generally are armed with greatswords and lances or rapiers and bucklers. In addition to the combat gear, each knight also carries a simple wooden gandalf pipe and a fat bag of loud.

	<TEXT> I've always been enamoured with the nightlife of the future. I like techno a lot, and I imagine in the future techno clubs (not EDM, there's a difference) will be vastly more popular, especially in North America. 

So while high tech automation deals with lots of the monotonous aspects of daily life, this frees up a lot of time for artists/musicians and party goers, leading to a more developed and sophisticated nightlife culture.
