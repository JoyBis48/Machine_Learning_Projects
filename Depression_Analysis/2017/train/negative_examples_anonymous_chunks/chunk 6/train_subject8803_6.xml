	<TEXT> You can keep a close eye on [Ticketswap](www.ticketswap.nl) Its a safe(ish) website where people sell their tickets if they bought one but are not able to go. Other than that you can search for the facebook event, at most concerts there is someone who tries to sell their ticket (mostly last minute though and there is a possibility you get scammed) 

Good luck! </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Get a lock that is more expensive then your bike.

This is gold advice (but a bit over the top) you can get a really decend bike for 50-80 euro's (or 10-20 form a junk) and a really good lock for +-40. 

also, a bike stealing friend of mine once told me: "if your bike is not attached to something like a post or a rail with its lock, then its not locked" </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was thinking why this line was so familiar to me.
It is actually used at the beginning of a PvP game of star conflict (f2p online steam game with spaceships), pretty cool! </TEXT>
