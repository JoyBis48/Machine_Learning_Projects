	<TEXT> Yea...  [about that](http://www.reddit.com/r/denvernuggets/comments/3aciqm/what_is_up_with_the_negativity_of_this_sub/).... 

r/kings is actually a super friendly and inviting sub.  But when you post stuff regarding a star player with no credible source either for karma *or* out of bad choice...  That's when they have come out.  We haven't been abrasive and we are open to all opinionated questions...  Shit I post multiple bad posts a month and still get treated well here.  It's how you may be coming across especially as a moderator or r/denvernuggets and judging another sub.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Cousins upside is huge as a scoring center.  I am overjoyed to have him for 3 years.  His attitude improved under Malone so I'm convinced he will be better again.  His contract is good for being arguably the best center in the league.  Many years looking forward boogie.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Little chance of effect?  Damian Lillard was the 6th pick?  A 7'0 defensive 5 has great impact...  You are making assumptions on notions you can't justify. We can't project anything about any pick.  If you are asking me if I would rather gamble on a franchise changer or take the sure thing at improving 1 step of my franchise,  I take the gamble because we can sign free agents with the money we save from Ty.  5s don't come very often.  Our post would be stacked and we could sign a 1 or 2 for probably cheaper than Ty or maybe attract an even better guard with all the talent we now have.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You are making Lawson sound like he is LeBron. (meaning he has the power to take us to the ship)  I agree that Lawson is great but it was known since last year that Lawson was on the trading block. I would rather hold the pick until 6th to see if WCS falls.  Call us on draft day.  You guys are dumping Lawson in my opinion no matter what. Winslow wouldn't be a horrible pick.  But you are right,  only time will tell if we are stupid enough to give you guys 6th + 7th + Stauskas or McCallum (you keep putting McCollum who is on the blazers)  while you dump Lawson and Hickson on us like you guys keep talking about on your thread.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> ^ Fuckin trippin

Edit: We have a capable point guard in Collison.  Lawson would be great for our team but over a defensive 5...?  You are insane. Lawson has shown what he can do...  WCS could be a future asset at a much more reasonable cost. Let's be frank...  You don't want lawson as much as lawson doesn't want you guys.  Just because you want a 6th and 7th pick doesn't mean you get to wish it upon yourself....  Hence my first statement.  </TEXT>

Some fat fucks cheered while most sneered. Blah blah blah freedom of speech and expression blah blah blah. They decide to flood /r/all with multiple subs and gild these genius ideas which give back to the imposing fat fucks. Dust settles and Reddits richer,  fatter and quieter.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Fair Oaks Brew pubhas craft beers. It's new so closes early. Around 10-11.

This place is in old folsom which is a nice place to go on weekends. Killer food as well.Samuel Hornes Tavernis great.

If your willing to travel,Low Brauis a mainstay for the "Hipster" crowd downtown and is always packed.

If your looking for just a place to blow off steam and play pool or something, Players bar and grill has a ton of options and sterling bridges is a nice place to just be in. All relatively close to gold river. (15 minutes)
