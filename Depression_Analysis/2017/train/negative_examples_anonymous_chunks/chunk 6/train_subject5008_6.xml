	<TEXT> I was in Afghanistan in 2010. We used to always ask a bunch of standard counter insurgency type questions: have the Taliban been around recently, have the local soldiers given them any trouble, have the Americans given them any trouble, have they heard anything about weapons/ieds, is anyone in their family in need of medical care etc. Our last question would always be "Do you know where Osama Bin Laden is?" This always got a bunch of laughs. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yup, if I was the boss I'd also want to know if any of my employees had excessive credit card debt, were cheating on their spouse, had any chronic medical conditions, used any illegal drugs etc. That doesn't mean it is the responsibility of anyone and everyone to inform me of these things. It doesn't sound to me like your friends are so terribly concerned with the reputation of the PI and lab as much as they are excited about "getting" the the heckler. They sound like petty, miserable people.....just like virtually every post-doc I've ever met. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It may appear that way when you see them used in COIN but things would look very different in a conventional war. That tank would be operating with infantry and artillery support, so anyone shooting missiles is going to be on the receiving end of artillery, auto cannon, and machine gun fire. Few (if any) high end antitank missile systems are disposable so you may get shot off but the system will likely be destroyed by the return fire when the launch signature is noticed. Disposable systems are very unlikely to score a hit and short ranged enough to be almost suicidal in anything but an urban environment. There also is the issue of transport. Man portable anti tank systems might be fairly effective in a static defensive role but then you just get killed from the air and by artillery. If you want to maneuver you need to be transported in trucks, which are not very survivable. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I wasn't intending to be hard on the French, my point was that things happen fast and the idea of "building up" in response to an invasion is a joke. Things today would likely happen much faster than during WW2 and at least then France was EXPECTING an invasion. Now Europe just has its head in the sand AND depends on Russia for much of its natural gas. Yes nukes are out there but I somehow doubt the willingness of France or GB to be wiped off the map for Poland or Romania...or perhaps even Germany. Yes there are satellites, but how long would it take the Russians to mobilize? Certainly less time than for the Germans to build 2000 tanks and train 500,000 men. Lets not forget that the first day of the war could involve Russian strategic bombers hitting high value targets all over western Europe...a move to which the allies would be incapable of responding in kind.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've got a scenario for everyone in this thread. Say the USA pulls out of Europe and says "not our problem anymore." If Russia turns off the gas, rolls through Belarus with a wink and a smile, and then heads into Poland....when would NATO stop them? Would they deploy their forces to the front in Poland, or safe them do defend their own borders? How about when they got to Germany? Yea, France and GB have nukes...when would they use them? If they did Russia would respond and put them back in the dark ages. Would they take that for Poland? For Germany? For Belgium? What if they Stopped at the Elbe and sued for peace...would you accept? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There may be people that can answer this a little better, I think unfortunately this may be a crap shoot to a degree. You could say something like, "I'm a very inquisitive person and I like to take an active role in my medical care, do you think your style of care is compatible with a patient who asks a lot of questions?" Unfortunately, I think that the vast majority of doctors would say "yes of course," even if this wasn't really the case. The best would be if you know someone who is very satisfied with their GP and go to that doctor. There are online review sites, but my personal feeling is that they are basically worthless because patients are far more likely write a review if they are unsatisfied and EVERY doctor is going to have some unsatisfied patients. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yea, age definitely could be a factor (culture can play a role as well). The truth is that some patients WANT an autocrat that will just tell them what to do (perhaps an older model), while others want a partner that will discuss options/risks and help them decide (perhaps a more current model), and others want someone who will just do whatever they tell them (probably not very safe/ethical/legal). It sounds like this guy doesn't fit you very well. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yea, that sucks. Out of curiosity (don't take this the wrong way) does this doctor work in an area with lots of poorer/less educated people? Sometimes doctors in that serve populations like this can adopt an autocratic style because they are used to passive patients who rarely ask any questions. Ultimately, it sounds like his bedside manner sucks. You should never be afraid to ask your doctor questions and they should be prepared to give you clear answers. If they won't/can't find a new doctor. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You're absolutely right. I've posted this numerous times but it doesn't matter. This is about feelings not facts. People simply want to be able to ride the T and have someone else pay for most of it....cause feelings. 

Those numbers are massively overstated because (from the MBTA)
Unlinked trips are the number of passengers who board public transportation vehicles. Passengers are counted each time they board vehicles no matter how many vehicles they use to travel from their origin to their destination.
Bus and subway ridership is estimated based on CharlieCard or CharlieTicket or cash transactions on MBTA fareboxes and fare gates. We then adjust for customers who transfer within downtown subway stations or who show their passes to an inspector, or children and others who do not use the fare equipment.). The adjustment is calculated from statistics from studies and inperson ridership counts. Currently, farebox and fare gate information is not 100% real time. It is not immediately available at the end of the month. However, the MBTAs goal is to develop daily real time counts in the future
In reality only about 300K people use the ANY FORM OF PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION for commuting in Massachusetts. http://i.imgur.com/5Mkdl4f.png http://i.imgur.com/8j3jG0O.png UNDENIABLE 100% TRUTH: MBTA riders make up a tiny percentage of the state's daily commuters </TEXT>
