	<TEXT> Bin Laden truly was like some goddamn James Bond supervillain. He took on the Soviet Union and (with lots of U.S. help) the Mujahadeen slowly bled the USSR dry and helped speed up its collapse. It wasn't the main cause, but it didn't help them. Then he turned his sights on the U.S. and with 19 hijackers set the U.S. on a course of war for over a decade, slowly bleeding them of trillions of dollars. Now the USA sits as a virtual police state, bailing out banks while the middle class disappears. He was an asshole, but he was a smart asshole.

	<TEXT> Thomas Frank has an excellent piece in the new Baffler about this:

http://thebaffler.com/past/academy_fight_song

Political scientist Benjamin Ginsberg tells the sorry tale in his 2011 book, The Fall of the Faculty. Back in the day, Ginsberg tells us, American universities were governed by professors, who would take time out from their academic careers to manage the institutions business affairs. Today, however, the business side of the university has been captured by a class of professionals who have nothing to do with the pedagogical enterprise itself.

Administrators: Their salaries are generous, their ranks expand year after year, and their work requires no peer review and not even much effort. As Ginsberg reminds us, most of them dont teach courses, they dont squabble like English professors at the MLA, and no one ever suggests replacing them with adjuncts or temps. As tuition balloons, it is administrators who prosper. In fact, their fortunes are an almost exact reverse image of the tuition-indebtedness of the young. </TEXT>

Why would he do it? He's Mike Tyson, the heavyweight champion of the world. He can get any one of a million women with a snap of his fingers, yet he has to rape someone? I don't buy it.

The fact that white America kills every black man who stands up for his rights like Medgar Evers, Martin Luther King, Malcolm X and Fred Hampton probably has something to do with it.

	<TEXT> Sigh.

Can a "boy" beat up a grown man to have such injuries as Zimmerman had? It's not slander if it's true and shows evidence that's relevant, such as showing that Trayvon was perfectly capable of violence.

You mean the ["very insignificant"](http://news.yahoo.com/zimmerman-trial-judge-tells-jury-ignore-detectives-description-163625943.html) injuries? Here we have the crux of the issue. Zimmerman was a coward. He had 25 pounds on Trayvon! Yet he couldn't handle him, and instead of fighting like a man, he shot an unarmed 17-year-old like a bitch. You just accept without question that Zimmerman shot in self-defense. I don't.

If your hero George had just been minding his own business, none of this would be an issue. Instead, he played cop and ended up murdering an unarmed 17-year-old. As a result, he will live the rest of his life in fear. Good.

	<TEXT> People can watch the entire interview and decide for themselves. What makes his answer particularly disgusting is that, as Cenk pointed out, he was being asked a question about how to bring people together, how to bring some healing to this situation. And he answers by bringing up the guns and drugs, which is just disgusting in the extreme. Perhaps the worst answer he could have given.

That George Zimmerman will live the rest of his life in fear, looking over his shoulder, bothers me not in the slightest. That's what you get for stalking and murdering an unarmed person. Fuck him. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes, all of that came out during the trial. You just don't seem to understand why it is wrong to slander a dead boy that your brother murdered. The links you provide are not evidence that he was growing marijuana nor that he was seriously trying to purchase a gun. How many 17-year-olds' cellphones have pictures of weed and guns? Probably most of them, but that is not evidence, and certainly not the kind of evidence that you would need to justify slandering a dead boy that your brother murdered after he got away with murdering him. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In the state of Florida, the season on African-Americans now runs year round. Come one, come all.  And bring a handgun. The legislators are fine with this blood on their hands. The governor, too. One man accosted another and when it became a fist fight, one man  and one man only  had a firearm. The rest is racial rationalization and dishonorable commentary.

If I were a person of color in Florida, I would pick up a brick and start walking toward that courthouse in Sanford. Those that do not, those that hold the pain and betrayal inside and somehow manage to resist violence  these citizens are testament to a stoic tolerance that is more than the rest of us deserve.  I confess, their patience and patriotism is well beyond my own.

Behold, the lewd, pornographic embrace of two great American pathologies:  Race and guns, both of which have conspired not only to take the life of a teenager, but to make that killing entirely permissible.  I cant look an African-American parent in the eye for thinking about what they must tell their sons about what can happen to them on the streets of their country.  Tonight, anyone who truly understands what justice is and what it requires of a society is ashamed to call himself an American. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> [Posner's answer]( http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/oswald/interviews/posner.html):

**Q: Can you explain what the House Select Committee on Assassinations (1978-79) found out in the acoustic evidence, and what happened afterward concerning the issue of the reliability of the evidence?**

A: The House Select Committee on Assassinations used sound experts to listen to a Dallas police Dictabelt. They concluded with a 95 percent certainty that there was a fourth shot fired at Dealey Plaza, and it came from the grassy knoll.

The National Academy of Sciences reviewed their work and found a multitude of errors and omissions. The most serious of which was that at the time that the Select Committee experts thought the shots were, [it] actually, [was] one minute after the assassination had actually taken place.

Dealey Plaza is a veritable echo chamber, and it makes it very difficult sometimes to analyze the acoustic testimony. However, by looking at the statements of a witness who gave an opinion as to the source of the shots, we can see certain trends.

Eighty-eight percent of the 179 witnesses who expressed an opinion said there were three shots and three shots only. The largest group that identified a location, 28 percent, said they came from the book depository. Only four witnesses, 2 percent of all the witnesses at Dealey, heard shots coming from more than one location. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I honestly don't see any holes in the Oswald theory. One of the books I read was *Oswald's Tale* by Norman Mailer, an exhaustive, 800+ page biography. By the time he was 24, Oswald had: joined the marines, gotten court-martialed, become a Marxist, defected to Russia, gotten married, moved back to the States, started a pro-Castro group, attempted to assassinate a General, shot the president and killed a cop. It was a crazy life that all points to a nobody who wanted to be a somebody and Kennedy's visit gave him the opportunity. Don Delillo probably put it best:



*"Oswald would not have walked two blocks to shoot at the president. The president had to come to him, and this is what happened, ruinously, on Nov. 22. This was an act of naked desperation. Oswald abandoned his claim to history and became the first of those soft white dreamy young men who plan the murder of a famous individual -- a president, a presidential candidate, a rock star -- as a way of organizing their loneliness and misery, making a network out of it, a web of connections."* </TEXT>

But you have yet to show me one single shred of evidence of any kind whatsoever. As I've said before, if Kennedy was killed by some conspiracy, it was the single most successful conspiracy in the history of mankind. So successful that every single piece of evidence about that conspiracy has been kept secret for 50 years. Not one single witness, not one piece of evidence has been revealed. That seems highly unlikely. </TEXT>

**Q: Can you give me the conventional conspiratorial descriptions of the "magic bullet's" movement, and what the four commissions which investigated the assassination concluded?**

A: Critics claim that the bullet came through President Kennedy, hesitated for a second and a half in mid-air, deciding where to go, then made a right turn, went over and hit Governor Connally in the right shoulder, came out of his right nipple, made another right turn to move over and hit Governor Connally's wrist. Then when it came out of here, decided "Where should I go?" and made a left turn, a 90-degree turn, and went into his thigh. Four government commissions all concluded that's absolutely false, that, in fact, it was a straight line right through the two men.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> [From the Posner interview:](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/oswald/interviews/posner.html)

**On the night of Nov. 22, where is Ruby emotionally?**

I view Ruby as very agitated from the night of the assassination, Friday. It continues to build through Saturday. A number of events take place that sort of seem to propel him at even a faster rate into what I view as this emotional deterioration.

One of them is the belief that the Jewish community in Dallas is going to be blamed for the assassination, based upon an ad that had run the day the president arrived, signed by a Jewish name. Another is when he comes across a billboard that says, "Impeach Earl Warren." [He believes] that it may be part of a right-wing plot connecting the billboard to the anti-Jewish campaign, furthering his excitability.

The third is that he runs into a stripper and a policeman together in a car on Saturday night. They talk to him for about an hour, and they carry on that Oswald should be taken and quartered; that if it was England, he would be carried through the streets, and he would be dead.

Ruby gets very worked up into this very anti-Oswald feeling. He is really at the edge of this emotional stability by the time Saturday rolls into Sunday.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> From the [Posner interview](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/oswald/interviews/posner.html):

**Q: Describe Lee Harvey Oswald's shooting ability.**

A: Just three weeks after joining the Marines, he's trained in the use of an M-1 rifle. He shoots on a rifle range [a score of] 212, which means he qualified for the second-highest position in the Marine Corps, that of a sharpshooter.

Near the end of his stay in the Marines in 1959, after being court-martialed twice and his morale was low, he went back to re-qualify himself in the range -- still shot a 191, and still qualified as a marksman. That meant that he could hit a 10-inch target eight times out of ten from 200 yards away. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Nope. It's suspicious as hell. As was the murder of Malcolm X, David Kelly, Gary Webb, and a whole host of others. Conspiracies exist. But the thing with JFK is this: in 50 years, not one single shred of hard evidence has come to light. Not one. Not even a little bit. Other than hearsay and conjecture, there simply is not one single piece of hard evidence at all. You know why? Because it doesn't exist. Seriously, check out "Oswald's Ghost." Excellent documentary.

	<TEXT> Sigh. The big one. Here's the thing. If you shoot someone in the back of the head, the bullet hole going in is small. The shot coming out is big. The explosive force out of the front is going to push the head back.


From the [Posner](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/oswald/interviews/posner.html) interview:

**Q: The head wound. Everyone looks at the backward motion of the president's head and says, "That's got to mean the shot came from the front and shoved the head back."**

A: When I first saw the Zapruder film, I thought that it was evidence of a shot from the front. ... I asked the experts, "What does that mean, that backwards head movement?" What they told me is, several things are happening. First, as the cortex of the brain is destroyed, a neuromuscular response shoots down the spine, sending a seizure through the body. The body's muscles twitch, with the large muscles in the back predominating.

Remember, Kennedy's wrapped into a back brace. It's wrapped right underneath his breast all the way down and wrapped around his legs. You can't tell from that seizure where he's going to move in the car. But then something happens. Out the right side of his head, an explosion takes place. On the [enhanced Zapruder film](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPdBXh-ltaA), you can see a cloud, a red mist of brain and blood tissue moving forward. It's almost a jet effect. As that propels out his head, it has much more force than the force of the bullet moving in, and it shoots him in the opposite direction. It shoots out to the right front and left, violently.

Two things. As the president's brain is destroyed, he goes into a neuromuscular seizure. His body starts to stiffen up. At the same time that the wound explodes out the right front side of his head and as that blood and brain tissue moves out, it forces him in the opposite direction, the jet effect, back and to the left, violently.  </TEXT>

(John Ali, the NOI's national secretary was an FBI agent.) But the problem with Kennedy is that there is no actual, real, hard, concrete evidence. None. At all. Not even a little bit. Just some hearsay. In 50 years not one single shred of hard evidence has come to light. It's because there isn't any. Seriously, check out Oswald's Ghost, probably the best documentary on the assassination. It answers a lot of these questions. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Two weeks past his 17th birthday, yes. I'm not assuming he didn't start the confrontation, but there is no proof he did and, I think, plenty of proof of how aggressive Zimmerman was: "Fucking punks", "Assholes", driving around with a loaded gun, following Trayvon (even after he was asked not to). Only if you give Zimmerman every benefit of every doubt does his story make sense, which I won't do. Not with Trayvon dead.

The thing is, even if every aspect of Zimmerman's story is true and we believe every single thing he says, I still think he should go to jail. If we let Zimmerman go, then it's just open season on people. It means I can go around with a gun, provoke people, yell "Help!", kill them and then claim self-defense. That's insanity.

	<TEXT> Posner addresses that in the interview linked above:

"The House Select Committee on Assassinations used sound experts to listen to a Dallas police Dictabelt. They concluded with a 95 percent certainty that there was a fourth shot fired at Dealey Plaza, and it came from the grassy knoll.

The National Academy of Sciences reviewed their work and found a multitude of errors and omissions. The most serious of which was that at the time that the Select Committee experts thought the shots were, [it] actually, [was] one minute after the assassination had actually taken place.

Dealey Plaza is a veritable echo chamber, and it makes it very difficult sometimes to analyze the acoustic testimony. However, by looking at the statements of a witness who gave an opinion as to the source of the shots, we can see certain trends.

Eighty-eight percent of the 179 witnesses who expressed an opinion said there were three shots and three shots only. The largest group that identified a location, 28 percent, said they came from the book depository. Only four witnesses, 2 percent of all the witnesses at Dealey, heard shots coming from more than one location." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Other communities face robberies yet unarmed sixteen-year-olds don't get gunned down because they don't have Zimmermans walking around.

Saying your life is in danger after the fact doesn't make it so. A few scratches and a bloody nose doesn't make it so. I think Zimmerman overreacted and a boy is dead. He should suffer the consequences.

Having a half-black man in the White House doesn't mean a thing for the majority of black people in the U.S. [The war on drugs is a disguise for a war on black people](http://davidsimon.com/a-fight-to-the-last-mexican/).

"One of every nine black families has a close relative in prison over aggressive arrests done by US law enforcement. Even though usage of illegal drugs are roughly the same along racial lines, the Drug Policy Alliance Network shows that blacks constitute 13 percent of drug users, but are 38 percent of people arrested for drug offenses, and 59 percent of those convicted. The Human Rights Watch supported this claim as well, stating that of blacks convicted of drug crimes 71% are incarcerated, compared with 63% of convicted whites. US laws have a much higher penalty for possession and distribution of crack cocaine, a frequently used drug among African Americans and this affects the Black community as well." - Wiki

	<TEXT> See, I just think you're giving Zimmerman way too much benefit of the doubt. The way you're presenting him is as a dutiful citizen going about his business and helping the neighborhood. From his comments about fucking punks and assholes always getting away and his suspicion of Trayvon (which in hindsight was 100% wrong), I think it's clear he's on the prowl looking for trouble. Why follow him? He was looking for trouble. Why have a gun? He's looking for trouble. If he was a neighborhood watch good guy, the police would've been called and that would be that. But Trayvon's dead and Zimmerman killed him, we can agree on that, and the idea that unarmed 16-year-old Trayvon posed such a threat that Zimmerman was within his rights to blow a hole in his chest is just absurd to me.

Frankly, if Zimmerman gets off scott-free, there *should* be riots in Florida. Black people are still second-class citizens in the U.S. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Actually, I took an interest in the JFK assassination a while back and after reading quite a few books on the topic, and watching several documentaries, I would have to say that I am more convinced than ever that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone. Crazy, I know, but I think you'll find all of the conspiracy theory is just that, theory. No concrete evidence of a conspiracy has ever been uncovered in the last 50 years because no evidence exists. This [Gerald Posner](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/oswald/interviews/posner.html) interview is pretty good at answering a lot of the questions around the assassination. Also, check out ["Oswald's Ghost"](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/oswald/). It makes an extremely strong case for Oswald acting alone. They also make clear that Jim Garrison was a loon. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No, it hasn't been settled. There are arguments on both sides. I think here is a clear case of reasonable doubt. The prosecution interpreted it as "fucking punks", you think it's "fucking cold", I think it's "fucking coons". Reasonable doubt.

[Prowl](http://www.thefreedictionary.com/prowl): "To roam through stealthily, as in search of prey or plunder." That's what he was doing.

[Vigilante](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/vigilante): "One who takes or advocates the taking of law enforcement into one's own hands." That's what he was.

[Fake-ass](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=fake-ass): "Describing or pertaining to one's inability to accomplish their motives. When one tries to be something they are not." That one's from the Urban Dictionary, but I think it applies pretty well!

I am using that quote to show his frame of mind, not who initiated the confrontation. His frame of mind was clearly, obviously, already confrontational. As for Trayvon's "drug use", that's the weakest shit I've heard about this entire case. The idea that marijuana is at all relevant is just more pro-Zimmerman nonsense. Besides, whether or not he was "on drugs" is different than if he had marijuana in his system, and I understand the latter to be the case.

Watch the O'Donnell clip, it's good.

So, we just have to agree to disagree. I think it's unreasonable doubt. I think he's going to get off scott-free and Florida will explode. We'll see.

As an aside, you seem like a reasonable person, doesn't it bother you that you're throwing your lot in with the FOX News/Breitbart/anti-black crowd? They're pretty much wrong 100% of the time. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If the prosecution didn't use it, it's probably because they didn't think it was clear enough to help their case. That's not proof he didn't say it. Maybe he said goons? Maybe it was tunes? Maybe it was dunes? Maybe.

Zimmerman WAS on the prowl. He WAS a vigilante. He WAS a fake-ass cop. Those aren't emotional terms. They're facts. What else could you possibly call him? His own words condemn him. "This guy looks like he's up to no good, or he's on drugs or something. These assholes, they always get away. These fucking punks." and, quite likely, "[fucking coons](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IKKqnF0WlE)". (A different link than the previous one. Lawrence O'Donnell takes apart the argument that it's "goons.")

I think the "reasonable doubt" standard is what we disagree upon. To me, to suggest Zimmerman should get off scott-free could only be arrived at by invoking unreasonable doubt. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You're letting yourself get emotional and sarcastic, that doesn't really help the discussion.

You're talking about one audio expert, I'm providing you with the fact that it was 16 degrees Celsius and he had a jacket on and the actual recording of what he said. You can continue to believe whatever you want, but I think you're stretching the facts past the breaking point. It wasn't cold and it's certainly possible, is it not, that he said coons? Surely there's some reasonable doubt there.

Again, he was on the prowl with a loaded gun and followed Trayvon, an altercation ensued and Trayvon is dead. Somehow, you're putting all of this together to the point of exculpating Zimmerman. You're not even allowing the possibility of him being responsible for the murder he committed. I haven't said any of those things about Trayvon, yet you're basically saying them about Zimmerman. Proud and noble defender of justice saving us all from the house-robbing darkies. More like fake-ass cop following people with a loaded gun who got in over his head and committed murder. But in America, you can get away with murder as long as it's black people you're killing. That's been true for a long time, and you refuse to see America's racial history as playing a part in this story. That's being willfully obtuse in my book.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I highly, highly doubt it sounds like cold to you. I think you can obviously hear him saying coons but your bias won't let you admit it. The thing is, it *wasn't* cold. [It was over 16 degrees Celsius at the time he made the call](http://www.wunderground.com/history/airport/KSFB/2012/2/26/DailyHistory.html?req_city=Sanford req_state=FL req_statename=Florida) *and* Zimmerman had a jacket on! "Cold." Bullshit.

The whole issue of who made the confrontation physical is a matter of pure conjecture. Trayvon is dead so we only have one side of the story. You don't know who made it physical and neither do I. All we know is that a self-appointed vigilante driving around with a gun murdered an unarmed 16-year-old. The majority of people on reddit think he should get off scott-free. That's fucking insane.

I'm not making this racial, it is racial. Black people are disposable in the U.S. and have been for a long time. This is just another example of it. As I said, if Trayvon was white and Zimmerman was black, this case would be open and shut. That's America.

That is the value America puts on the life of black men. Hopefully all four of those black guys go away for a long, long time.

	<TEXT> This is EXACTLY the kind of movie you don't want to know anything about before watching for the first time. Worry about "understanding" and "appreciating" it later. You only get to watch this for the first time once, and it is best to go into it knowing nothing. The analysis can come later.

	<TEXT> If I had to describe the way I survive its like vice squeezin

The reason I'm black and still breathin

Heathens will breed heathens so

Everybody's suspect I must check your ID

Cuz you lookin sheisty you might be intelligence

Someone that Del's against

Opposite or positive

When I drop the law against nature be faithful

Why should I hate you we ain't that different

We may act differen't in some ways

But we still grouped together like a fuckin survey

Sufferin and fuck em all's the motto

I'm trapped in a bottle

My music's gettin hollow

That's what happens when humanity you follow

Where every leak or info is hard to swallow

Sell your Marlboros and car insurance

Put niggas on the moon and can't pay your burdens

I smoke herb and rock a turban

Meditate on the world and whats occurrin

A lot of white boys like the style and copy

Dig in something deeper and youll peep that were not free

It's not about the seperation its about the population

	<TEXT> There is an excellent documentary on the Mafia called "Excellent Cadavers." I saw it a few years ago and thought it was quite good. Here's a NYT review:

	<TEXT> What a two-faced hypocrite...from wiki:

"In April of 2010, Fathers4Justice members backed Caroline Nokes for election as her party backed Fathers4Justices' campaign for change to family law. Nokes campaigned along side Fathers4Justice for her election, once elected in 2013 Nokes broke ties with Fathers4Justice and their campaign." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Word. Couldn't agree more. If only he'd had that budget. If only I trusted someone today to do it today...someone working with HBO? Fortunately, between the manga and the anime, what we have is a modern sci-fi story that stands among the best the 20th century has to offer. It's as good as Star Trek, Star Wars, Blade Runner, etc. Thanks Katsuhiro! Also, Domu is brilliant!

	<TEXT> I really, really hate to be THAT GUY, but as a huge fan of the anime, I just have to say, if you liked the movie, you'll LOVE the manga. As a comic book fan for many years prior to reading Akira, I was blown away. I just can't recommend it enough. I truly believe it will enhance your enjoyment of the film. </TEXT>

The people who read the books go to the people who can't read the books, the poor people, and say, "We have to have a change." So, the poor people make the change. And then, the people who read the books, they all sit around the big polished tables, and they talk and talk and talk and eat and eat and eat. But what has happened to the poor people? They're dead! That's your revolution! So, please, don't tell me about revolutions! And what happens afterwards? The same fucking thing starts all over again!" </TEXT>
