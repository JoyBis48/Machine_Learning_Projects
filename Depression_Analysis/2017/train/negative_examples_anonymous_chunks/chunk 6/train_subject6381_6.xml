I think it's a really good idea to use a festival as your reason to meet up, that works perfectly and totally makes it worth traveling for both of you :) i hope you guys keep raging together, you look like you have a lot of fun and i love to see that! Don't lose that with each other. Peace and love dear! :) </TEXT>

I feel like we dont really SEE enough of eachother here! A huge part of why I rave is to get to know a completely diverse group of people in a different setting. Its like we all become the same for a night but so many people have completely different stories! So I encourage all of you to post a pic with you and your favourite rave partner, ive post one of myself and my boyfriend to get us started! You can post a friend, boyfriend/girlfriend, or even a family member if youvhappen to be that lucky!

I also think it would be great if you posted a little blurb on how you met eachother/started raving together and what has made them so significant to you :) it'll be a little bit like a show and tell about your personal rave story! Alright go! </TEXT>
