	<TEXT> If it's saying your graphics driver crashed, then it'll be your video drivers. Try updating them or installing a different version. 

I have a 980 too, I haven't updated to the latest version yet (that hit yesterday). And you're a good example of why I don't update everything the second it's out. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> With the computer being years old, I'd **strongly reccommend changing the MB** out for a newer one, even if it isn't very good.

From personal experiance, older boards tend to catch fire MUCH EASIER. Mine set fire due to a very small (and I mean very small) amount of dust which overheated a capacitor, blew it up and caused an internal fire. If i'd of left it running while I was out, my house would be gone.

Not only this, but it may not be up to date with the hardware it's running, check and see if the MB manufacturer are still putting updates out for it and get the latest one ASAP.

Other than that, epic upgrade! ;) </TEXT>

Albeit I'm mediocre at making factual and logically thought out points though. </TEXT>
