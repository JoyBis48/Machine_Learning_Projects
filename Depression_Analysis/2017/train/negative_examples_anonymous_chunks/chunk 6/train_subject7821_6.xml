	<TEXT> Even as a kid, I felt Jedi kinda sucked... compared to the original 2. 

Lucas came back in the fold a bit with Jedi. It was originally 'Revenge of the Jedi'.

But then he got to thinking about his (new) children. He became soft. He didn't understand the difference between a movie being 'kid friendly'   'for kids'. 

He changed the name to 'Return'   the tone. He replaced a planet of wookies   replaced them with ewoks (easier to sell toys). He changed Luke's approach at Jabba's palace. He didn't realize his movies weren't kid movies, just movies kids enjoy. He did what he's prone to do   made it weak. 

Take the Greedo scene in IV. Greedo is a bad guy who's gonna kill Han if Han doesn't come with him. He's got a gun drawn on him (he's gonna shoot first, but Han beat him to it). Yet, Lucas became a Dad   suddenly thinks kids can't understand the situation. Even as a kid, I thought VI was crap (compared to originals)   wasn't surprised with the prequels... 

If you make something aimed directly at kids, it's gonna suck for adults.  The secret is make it something you can take a child to watch but made for everyone. Don't spoon-feed the kids, don't dumb it down, don't think they can't understand/appreciate it. 

(BTW: when will they include the Han/Leia wedding footage? When they test screened 'Revenge of the Jedi' there was a wedding at the end... ) </TEXT>

Objective matches are measured in W/L, therefore your K/D shouldn't apply. (so what if you had a perfection if you lost?)

	<TITLE> Postmates: company tells their drivers not to tip on food orders </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-12-12 01:03:36 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I work at a restaurant in Austin, TX. I have at least 5 togo orders / day from Postmates (a delivery service which operates in multiple cities). 

Over the past year, we have never gotten a tip from any of their drivers. I have spoken with other food service employees from other restaurants who gripe about how they never tip   come in multiple times per day. 

I have several years experience in food service. It's common for their drivers to brag about how much money they make (decent amount)   inquire how I should apply to work for Postmates. 

Today, a driver opened up   said "I'd like to tip you but I can't... I finally found out why they don't tip:

* Postmates instructs them not to tip...ever. 

This company who makes money from the food service industry in multiple cities explicitly instructs their drivers to never tip using company credit cards...

(BTW: If you are a driver, you can tip cash... I know it's togo, but at least a dollar. Most everyone in this industry tips, even on togo)

	<TEXT> OK, sounds like something from the National Enquirer, right next to the wolfman elvis...

I've been following these Romanian kids (the Stroes) for a couple years. Their father (a fitness freak) has been making these kids work out at least 2 hours a day since they were barely able to walk... I've even got a google news alert about them. I find it interesting (one of them holds the world record for vertical pushups   some other record). Of the numerous articles I've read / watched, this is the first mention of a 'mutation' I've ever read... I tried to cross reference that condition with results of the kids   came up with nothing.

I know that condition exists, but I'm sure their bodies are the result of hard work   not being mutants.

	<TEXT> I've always felt the US's 'war on drugs' should be protested by Mexico. It's a prohibition that has only created a huge demand for crime. US money has been funneled out of the country   into the hands of gangsters   crime lords. It's a huge violent fight to control this source of insane income. Mexico has crime syndicates that have to house US money is different houses it's so rampant   abundant. This prohibition has funded this criminal takeover of Mexico... the US has created it.
