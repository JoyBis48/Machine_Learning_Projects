	<TEXT> Wait, the charge of the light brigade was a historical event? I always thought it was a poetic allegory, or Tennyson was using a fictitious event as a moral exemplar for pre-great war british children, not a documentable historical fact.

Also, I hate to be the one to point this out, but if this were an authentic battlefield there would be a lot more debris than just a few cannonballs. Not saying this isn't genuine, just it might be fair to assume this was either a very selective and pre-organised photograph, or it was taken some considerable time after the event. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The principal behind this is called exponential growth; every generation you go back your number of direct ancestors doubles, so you have 2 parents, 4 grandparents, 8 great-grandparents, 16 great-great-grandparents etc. By the time you go back just 10 generations you already have over 1000 direct descendants! Extrapolate this over such a large time period as 1000 years and the number of  direct descendants you have will be so huge that it will be far more than there have ever been human beings.

There is a story in China that uses the same principal. A peasant puts a single grain of rice on a square of a chessboard and asks the emperor to give him two grains of rice on the next square and to keep doubling it across the board. The emperor agrees and by the time the peasant has made it to the last square he owns all the rice China has ever or will ever produce.

The family tree scenario works because after only a few generations your family tree will become so convoluted that it is inevitable that it will cross over many many times, so the same person will appear multiple times on your list. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm going to take a guess that you sought advice on circumcision from someone involved in the clergy? I'm sorry to disagree with you but it has been proven by the medical profession that circumcision does not hold any benefit, think about it logically. If it were beneficial for men not to have foreskin, we simply wouldn't be born with it. Evolutionary economy is ruthless, everything evolved on a human body either serves or has served a purpose, surely that is obvious. Also the idea of preventing infection is utterly ridiculous, how many foreskin infections have you heard of? Teach you son to be hygienic, don't mutilate his body. As for sexual pleasure, use your common sense please. It desensitises the penis, that is pretty much the whole point.

As to Mosaic law: Surely the obvious contradiction is why would one God set down the laws for man to follow in one book of The Bible only for the other God to disagree with the laws and use his own for the second book of The Bible. This is meant to be the infallible word of God remember, if you are a Christian. 

The idea that forcing such an irreversible act upon a unknowing child makes me nauseous. Why wouldn't you respect your son enough to wait until he is old enough to make such a unalterable choice for himself, in full view of the facts? Why is it normal to do this to children?

I say it again, circumcision has no physical benefit. If it did, we would not be born with foreskin in the first place. Use your brain. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I happen to know a great deal about Christianity. The only old testament law Jesus definitively refuted was was that man could work on the sabbath, which remember was one of Gods ten infallible commandments, which of course negates the whole list of ten. The concept of having the Old Testament of laws followed by a the New Testament which negates those laws is utterly absurd, surely anyone can see that? If you are a Christian The Bible is meant to be the infallible word of God, why would one God disagree so much with the other (and himself) and what laws men should follow?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Nowhere did I mention Africa, nor anything related to race or any specific culture. Yet you assign these labels yourself. I shall not go so far as to accuse you of racism in return, but you seem to be more guilty of that you might realise.

Again you use the euphemism of *tradition*. Again, I point out that this is misleading, as a more accurate description might be *religious* tradition. I will of course admit that not all traditions are the same, but the uniting factor is that the *purpose* of genital mutilation of young girls is to stunt and repress sexual pleasure. This is barbarism. Do not protect such cruelty by claiming it as tradition. Do not patronise the thousands of miserable souls tortured by it. Do not be so cold and uncaring as to imply that such a vile thing should be sustained for the sake of *tradition*. To do so is moral equivalent of sacrificing these wretched girls on a stone alter.

Sources: Much of my specific information on this comes from various essays and books by Christopher Hitchens, as well as my own research in various journals (I volunteer with Unicef). For example, the use of the sharp stone, or the twine to be broken by male force upon marriage is part of the 'tradition', not me adding colour to the argument. I will not be so simple as to link the first article a google search will give me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Many people here are saying tradition which is somewhat misleading. The honest reason is *religious* tradition, rather than cultural. It is a commandment that all jewish boys must be circumcised on a specific day soon after birth. The man performing the circumsision is called a '*Mohel*' in Jewish tradition and to complete the process he cuts around the forskin, places his mouth on the severed penis and sucks off the foreskin before spitting it out with a mouthful of blood and spit. 

Remember that the Old Testament of the Bible is the Jewish Torah, so in theory any Christian has to follow every law that orthodox Jews do. Many modern American Christian continue the practice for this reason.

Circumcision has been roundly proven to not improve hygiene in the male and lessens sexual pleasure (as is presumably the whole point). It does not serve any medical purpose.

Apologies if this seems profanatory, I have been as to the point as I can </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I feel slightly sick that this got so many upvotes. Female genital mutilation is a very real thing and affects millions of women world wide. It is a disgusting and inhuman practice in which the clitorus is cut off, often with a sharp stone and the vaginal opening is sawn up with twine, not to be broken until the dreaded marital night by male force. The reason and justification for this practice sits squarely at the feet of organised religion, I am not an fire and brimstone r/athiest but blame where blame is due.

It is barbaric and inhumane and, as it still ruins the lives of so many people and thus is a standing insult to our species womanhood, not subject for satire.

	<TEXT> The trick with Solfeggietto is to play it at a smart even tempo which should give it some texture. The story my piano teacher told me is that Bach left no instruction on how fast it should be played so it's up to the performer to work it out, personally I find playing it at a good even speed does help to thicken the texture so you hear the overall chords rather than individual notes </TEXT>

When you were bodybuilding competitively did you take any special protein or diet supplements? I'm trying to work on some bodybuilding and just taking whey protein, would love to hear your opinion/advice!

I just watched '*Pumping Iron*', respect to you sir! Motivated me to work harder at the gym, so for that I thank you! Was there really that much competitiveness between you and Lou Ferrigno?

Thanks again for another AMA! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> China has one of the most powerful militaries in the world, easily equal to the US army. Why do you think they get away with all the human rights violations, blatant fascism and the invasion of Tibet? Furthermore, why do you think NK gets away with starving its people and developing illegal weapons? 

It is because NK are backed by China who are too powerful in military and economic terms for anyone to do anything about it. If China side with NK and this goes to war, you can bet that will mean WWIII unless piece with china can be assured by the US. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The trouble is, because of the opaque nature of arabic, it is very difficult to translate arabic into other languages (hence the massively varied interpretations). I agree that reading it would certainly alter peoples perspectives, although much like the Old Testament (or Torah, call it what you will) the level of wanton violence might make people think twice about organised religion, if that is your goal. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was once very sick in India for about 4/5 days, I had no one to help me as I was pretty much locked in a crummy hotel room and the temperature was getting as high as mid-50s celsius (Northern India in April). After a couple of days I was extremely sleep and food deprived and suppose my fever must have been off the charts as I started to hallucinate that my body was some kind of separate hostile entity that was fighting me, or waiting until I was off my guard or resting to make me be sick of worse again. 

I recovered after a few days, then spent the next month hiking solo in the Himalayas. I estimate I lost somewhere between 20-30 lb. in the space of a month. Totally worth it. </TEXT>
