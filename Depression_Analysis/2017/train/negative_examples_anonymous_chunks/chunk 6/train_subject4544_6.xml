	<TEXT> Sorry you got scammed dude! I truly mean it! I've been scammed before and it hurts; however, please don't let this faze your opinion on the rest of Reddit. Most of us are truly good people who would never resort to scamming! With that being said, just as a precaution you should check how much contribution they have in their guild. If they have anything less than 100k contribution I wouldn't trust them. Generally people who have been in the guild for a long time wouldn't attempt scamming people in the risk of getting kicked out of the guild. Again, I deeply apologize for what happened between you and my fellow guild members but please don't let this ruin your image of our guild! I hope you get your stuff back. I know for a fact that our leader of the guild will do whatever it takes to help you! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> An air freshener. Many years ago I was on a road trip with my parent's friends and we were stuck in a small car. Since it was a really hot and humid summer day, opening the windows only seemed to let more hot air in. Overall, it was extremely uncomfortable. Then things seemed to escalate ten-fold when my friend decides to unleash his silent but deadly fart in the car after we ate a local Mexican restaraunt. The remaining 4 hours of the car ride was not fun! </TEXT>
