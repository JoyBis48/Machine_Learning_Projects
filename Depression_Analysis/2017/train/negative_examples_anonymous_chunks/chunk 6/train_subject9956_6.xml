	<TEXT> I hated playing it because of only one reason - it frikkin scared me. I don't like horror games - I can play some, though, like more action ones like L4D or KF -, call me a chicken but I can't do it. 

On my first playthrough I got scared shitless almost to the end of Ravenholm and I stopped playing there until two years later (recently), when I thought fuck it and finished the game with cheats - it made it much easier for me. Subsequently I made it through E1 and I have yet to complete E2.

I think best thing about HL games is the world itself, the lore, the story and the atmosphere - it is mysterious, alien, attractive, and desolate. I am no big HL fan, but there is much to be read about it on the internet. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I had always had obsolete PCs, mostly second-hand - I had spent a good amount of time gazing at screenshots in game magazines, drooling and dreaming. I had never thought I would ever play those shiny shiny games. I know very well the ails of lowest setting gaming and slow 90s PCs. The breaking point came a year ago when I knew I would have a part-time job and I was wiser and knew that my dream could come true, especially thanks to Reddit.

Prior to the building I thoroughly went through every BaPC guide and BaPC-recommended guide to learn how to build a PC, I even went through rookie-mistake-horrors threads. When I finally picked the parts after some googling and consideration, I asked here if it is good and subsequently changed over half of the parts according to advice. I am not a good picker, I guess.

The building itself went good, though I was nervous as hell and it took me all day. Like "Gosh, my fingers sweat so much, argh, my hard-earned two-month pay have just gone out of window it will all burn out on the first go" everytime I touched anywhere. I don't think I should worry so much about touching the components, should I? The feeling when it turned on was worth it, though.

The sad thing is, I remember how to connect and take out parts and whatnot (during building I was surprised that I almost didn't need a guide how to connect the parts together, it is very obvious - literally, as BaPCers say, like a Lego), but by now I have wholly forgotten what to look for when picking parts (unlike some people here who just go to the store and casually pick up good compatible parts), but I suppose I can consult the internet when the need arises. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I disagree a bit. It is now commonly thought that spirituality has to do with supernatural, but Saganian definition of spirituality applies to us all. I wish the word "spiritual" wasn't associated with the supernatural, superstitious or gullible.

 Spirit comes from the Latin word to breathe. What we breathe is air, which is certainly matter, however thin. Despite usage to the contrary, there is no necessary implication in the word spiritual that we are talking of anything other than matter (including the matter of which the brain is made), or anything outside the realm of science. On occasion, I will feel free to use the word. Science is not only compatible with spirituality; it is a profound source of spirituality. When we recognize our place in an immensity of light years and in the passage of ages, when we grasp the intricacy, beauty and subtlety of life, then that soaring feeling, that sense of elation and humility combined, is surely spiritual. So are our emotions in the presence of great art or music or literature, or of acts of exemplary selfless courage such as those of Mohandas Gandhi or Martin Luther King Jr. The notion that science and spirituality are somehow mutually exclusive does a disservice to both.

I think there should be at least an option to let rovers stick to terrain, because driving several tens of kilometers is just tedious with all the explosions and whatnot. It does not even have to be teleporting, I would love to be able to ride on planets discovering interesting locations, but as I say, riding rovers now is just terribly done. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Don't timewarp so much. Often there will be some miscalculation or whatever with SOIs and it may throw you out of the system.

I think you could alter your orbit a little bit and see if you still get caught by Tylo, if not, then wait for a good opportunity to burn to get an intersect with Bop/Pol. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes, I mean, if you read the Bible as a fantasy that it is, you can draw good lessons from that and discard the bad ones (like you can do with any other book). When you believe it is a innerant guide to life and morality, that is where the problem arises. </TEXT>
