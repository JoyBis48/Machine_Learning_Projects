Seriously, I dislike Christy more, but I lost so much respect for Holly this past episode. I couldn't believe her tooth and nail defense of that board! Nia is, in my opinion, the least skilled of the Original team. Her inability to take corrections shows with her performances, she scores low. Holly needs to recognize this, and she doesn't.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I find it interesting he won the election given this admission. In America he wouldn't have gotten off the ground in politics being heckled by public and media. What is the mood of aliens and abductions among the populace? Is there a general feeling of acceptance to the phenomena? How does their media report on it? 

Great chess players tend to be quite intelligent. If this is true and he isn't being facetious, I wonder what the aliens might use him for.  Do they run the typical abduction routine?  Or, might they give him knowledge?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> While I enjoyed many of my classes, I did find some of them to be full of 'woo'. My instructor was into energy ball making, discussing why AIDS isn't a real disease(she had the whole class convinced), and she was into using unproven techniques on the class and testing on it like it was a real practice. This bothered me, but what also shocked me was the gullibility of those in the class. They ate up that shit. Claiming they could see their energy balls or discussing how AIDS just couldn't be real. It was disturbing. I can see how some people might change in ways that might not seem normal after such a class. It's indoctrination in a sense. I guess when you pay a lot of money for something the bullshit seems better because you don't want to believe you've been duped. Common sense and critical thinking shouldn't go out the window just because your professor says something. </TEXT>

You might start with Tune-In, there is a free Android app, which has a easy navigation system and you simply search for genre based music.  Key words to try out: Big Band, War Era Music, 30's   40's, or Rat Pack.  You can also search for band(The Ink Spots), or artists(Ella Fitzgerald).  I hope this helps   happy listening!! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hmm... didn't know this was illegal, kinda thought it was but just...hmmm

This happened with me in a company I worked for, it was actually quite a high paying job, and I was the one doing payroll. One week the owner blatantly said "The hours are too high for all employees, fix them"

The result wasn't pretty (hours wise) but...no one actually quit their job and all the murmuring was done quietly. It didn't feel good to do it as I knew for a FACT these guys worked their asses off, but that is what happens when you work in a company where EVERYONE is paid under the table. You just buck up and continue working. Shit happens. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't know what got me into ufo's exactly. For me the best way to put it is I've always just had a internal personal knowledge that the Universe is teeming with life. I've always struggled to understand how it is that others simply do not feel the same way. I remember just learning to read and checking out all the ufo themed books in my school and library. I started listening to C2C with Art Bell while in 6th or 7th grade. Just anything I could get my hands on about the subject I actively seeked out. 

I have had sightings both personal and with others. I am not afraid of it and I don't see any reason to be. They exist. It isn't a belief, it's just something I've always known. I do not believe I have ever been abducted, so I couldn't make a comment about that.

As for what I feel about ufo's now? I feel that the whole phenomena is seriously being misrepresented and mishandled. The cheap shows about ufos on tv as of late is laughable. Who in their right mind  eats this stuff up? I can't stand a new show that claims to be all new present rehashed stories. It is a slap in the face to those paying attention.  I am sick of faked videos of ufos making it onto the screen as if they are real. Ugh. I'm not going to even get into ancient aliens. Not worth my typing. But I will say I had always hoped for the populace to get their heads out of their assets and recognize the vastness of everything that is around them. The space in which you and I live is great and we can't see it all. But! If we are here, then it only stands to reason that something else may be waaayyyy over there. And that something else could be anything, even a planet. And, if that planet is lucky enough to have had the right chain of events to spark life, as we were so lucky to have on earth, then maybe, just maybe, there's someone over there, too. 

Ahhh ufology, you have so much restructuring and building to do before I can take you seriously again. Til then, the truth actually IS out there.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I know this will be very unpopular, but...

Time Warner Cable is my provider and my boyfriend had been paying the bill with his phone monthly. For some reason, they stopped processing the payments thru his phone to a non-existing account. We kept a record of the confirmation numbers given at the end of those payments. We didn't know they weren't going thru because when he'd call they would say we owed the same amount as the month before. It wasn't until I received a phone call stating I owed well over $350 to TWC that we realized something was wrong. I spoke to 3 different departments before they got me to the right one, but when they did they took down all the information, including the Verification Codes we had. Today I received my bill and owe only $35! They reinstated not only all the money but they took off a portion of this month's bill. I'm not saying "I 3 TWC!", no. But I do appreciate they did look into the issue and found the missing money and really helped me and my boyfriend in the pocketbook. 

I have no comment on AT T. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes, Art, yes we do. We've been waiting patiently, catching you on Ham and ssb, hoping for a return. I have been a C2C listener since the mid 90's and definitely miss Art's distinctive voice. So, welcome back. I can't wait to see what topics and guests you bring in. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Right. But simply stating that they saw a light in the sky is not lying. For instance, two weekends ago my boyfriend spotted a red light race across the skyline, north to south, over the ocean at Myrtle Beach. I also saw it as did his sister and a mutual friend. When people ask us what we think it was, we say we don't know. I think using the term UFO is alright, however we do not mean to say Extraterrestrial, we simply mean its literal term. Lots of sightings have been reported recently over that area, if I were to speculate I'd say military. But I don't really know. I wish more people would be honest and say they don't know instead of making up a fantastical story. In any case, that light, man, it sped across the sky so fast. Incredible. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I know my idea is not very feasible, but I just can't fathom THAT MANY people misidentified flares. Maybe the real footage was suppressed or maybe THAT MANY people really don't know flares from a giant V shaped low flying object. To be totally honest something about that whole event never sat well with me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I can do that, but the initial way I feel (even if I know the situation is not bad), I still have that pang. It is very hard to not feel that emotion of "oh this is bad" even tho I know it is no big deal. Like the first time I wore a tank top, I felt bad even tho mentally it is not. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have been out of the church for a long time, but, sometimes I still fall back into my old way of thinking. I get offended by things I have been taught to be offended by. I am so frustrated as I am acutely aware I shouldn't be offended. It is difficult and I don't know how to stop it. I mean its been almost 10yrs since I've been to church actively. Anyone else deal with that? Also I was seriously sheltered, so being an adult and being around other adults, it is a marked difference. My boyfriend doesn't want to shelter his son, but sheltering is all I know and a knee jerk reaction, and really quite natural for me. I know sheltering hurt me in certain ways so I don't want to do it, but I don't know then what is normal? This is all so foreign for me... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Speculation is fine so as long as attempts are made to understand. Also, people tend to believe speculation, but it's simply uninformed hypothesis. Who knows what's in that photo, honestly. Could be space junk, reflection of internal components, or something unknown to us. Too bad we are unable to simply jettison out there for a peak. </TEXT>
