	<TEXT> Not exactly. Note that the study found a life expectancy advantage to being overweight but none for being obese:

 Overweight patients, with a Body Mass Index (BMI) greater than 25, had lower mortality than normal weight patients, that is, those with BMI between 18.5 and 24.9. However, obese patients, with a BMI greater than 30, had mortality risk similar to that of normal weight patients.  </TEXT>
