	<TEXT> I am average height (5'6 female). My arms are super long and skinny, I've never been able to do correct push-ups or pull ups. To make it worse, I have incredibly tiny hands. An eight year olds hands can span mine almost perfectly. That itself doesn't bother me, but my nails grow square like a kids too, which makes my hands look ridiculous when the nails are painted :( </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Best friend of three years continually used me to make herself feel prettier, smarter, and richer (we were in high school, love those awkward times). She ended up dating my ex just to get at me, and started picking fights with me because I ended up with a wonderful relationship and she couldn't keep a boyfriend. Last words that came out of her mouth to me were "wow, you actually look pretty today!"  </TEXT>
