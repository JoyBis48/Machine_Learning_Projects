 Higher speeds can be attained if the skydiver pulls in his or her limbs (see also freeflying). In this case, the terminal velocity increases to about 320 km/h (200 mph or 90 m/s), which is **almost** the terminal velocity of the Peregrine Falcon diving down on its prey.

	<TEXT>  but they also know this type of protest draws a lot of attention from the media and is a way to show the discontent of the population.

Exactly, I don't understand this posture of "stop protesting and just enjoy it now that it's going to happen."

	<TEXT>   It seems like the only people who were upset by it were white people.

Where did you get this from? The article doesn't mention the race of the people who were upset, and the woman who is defending the lecture is just described as "married to an African American," meaning she's probably white herself. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Weirdest thing, after making that post I went in search of it like I've done countless times and actually found it on ebay!

I didn't have an issue number, just [this image](http://i.imgur.com/ZyPecue.png) from the Stephen Fry documentary. 

Can't wait for it to arrive, today was a good day. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Nice!

I have a bit of an obsession with Last Chance to See, myself. Only thing I'm missing in my collection is the original Observer Colour Magazine that led to DNA writing the book. If anyone has any clue as to where I can find it, I'd really be thankful. </TEXT>
