	<TEXT> The point is, as soon as the animated white-out eyes start moving/expressing motion, they will appear animated, fake, cartoony, and silly. For Deadpool, that will work wonders and fit the character perfectly. For Batman, a more grounded and realistic character in more grounded and realistic movies, it work against the look, feel, and tone of both the character and the movies. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You'd either have white-out eyes that don't move and don't express emotion, which no filmmaker or actor would want, or you'd have animated white out eyes which would be goofy and cartoony. Either way, not appropriate for any remotely serious Batman movie.

	<TEXT> It's not an issue of money. Of course Nolan and others have had the budget to white out the eyes; they don't want to for reasons posted throughout this thread, but mostly because the filmmakers want you to see the actor's real eyes. 

Also, because Batman is a more grounded, realistic comic book character compared to Deadpool, they took a more grounded, realistic approach to the look. The white, animated, expressive eyes in the Deadpool movie will look cartoony, and for Deadpool, that's perfect. For Batman, it would be laughable. 

Now I can't stop thinking of Batman: The Animated Series and the [infamous squint.](http://media.giphy.com/media/14iEFCXZcJmfXq/giphy.gif)  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's kind of my problem with Superman and the Justice League. The X-Men work because they're a team with a variety of powers. Yes, some are more powerful than others, but there aren't really much in the way of redundancies. 

Super strength? Superman, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern (with hard light construct assistance), Aquaman, Martian Manhunter, Cyborg, and the Flash (infinite mass punch anyone?). 

Flight? Superman, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern, Martian Manhunter. 

Neigh-invulnerable? Superman, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern (with hard light construct shielding), Aquaman, Martian Manhunter (more likely density shifts through it, but he's still physically tough), etc.

Super Speed? Superman and The Flash, although Martian Manhunter, Cyborg, Green Lantern, and Wonder Woman are able to get to wherever they need to go quickly, including across vast expanses of space.

Justice League *with* Superman just seems kind of redundant. Superman is a one-man superhero team. </TEXT>

US did the same thing back in the 1930s to stop the dust bowls: "After the howling winds passed and the dust settled, federal foresters planted 100 million trees across the Great Plains, forming a giant windbreak  known as a shelterbelt  that stretched from Texas to Canada."

Actually this project was started first in Algeria in the 70's. It's called the green dam.You can see it in this picture http://imgur.com/E140PYS

They used to take the kids from school from all over the country to plant trees there once a year. Drafted soldiers participated too. The forests exist to this day, I remember finding mushrooms under the trees. You can even spot animals like rabbits there.

EDIT: and it does work and the best economical way to do it is to have the community participate in planting the trees.

This gets posted on TIL all of the time.

But nobody talks about the fact that it hasn't happened or probably never will happen.

They just like to reap that sweet repost karma instead of posting things they actually learned.

A friend of mine while serving in Iraq as MP got to escort him and a few others for more than one USO show.... She stated he is not only extremely nice in person; he recognized her and remembered her name on the 2nd.

Love him or hate him, John cena makes kids wishes come true.

He legitimately cares about those kids.

I was at raw about a year ago, there was a kid there in a wheelchair in the crowd you could tell that he didn't jut break his leg. He was sitting pretty close and John cena threw his shirt, his hat, and I think his wristband things to this kid, everyone could tell it was for him and when someone near him caught it, cena would look at them and motion to pass it to the kid. Everyone did. It was really awesome.

Did you leave the Make-A-Wish foundation part out for any particular reason?

The Foo Fighters wanted to release a cover of Prince's "Darling Nikki" on a b-side, Prince told them that they couldn't due to copyright, so instead they just played it at shows for a while in the early 2000s. In retaliation, Prince played a cover of "Best of You" at the 2006 Super Bowl. However, his revenge didn't work out as planned, as Dave Grohl was stoked to get covered by one of his musical idols.

TL;DR Prince is a pretty reliable copyright dick

A fellow commenter claimed this movie was postmodern. I disagreed politely and explained my reasoning. If that's something considered a "dick move" by the Reddit masses, so be it. Negative Reddit karma isn't going to keep me up at night.

And I'll keep "modicum." It's a lovely word when it's precisely what I mean. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So glad you asked! I think Memento is postmodern in its depiction of life and memories. It supports the postmodern claim that truth is what we believe it to be, and memories are not reliable because we sometimes lie to ourselves, sometimes even unknowingly. The underlying idea is that 'real' truth does not exist. If postmodernism is, at its core, questioning the certainty of things, surely our own minds and the way we lie to ourselves is valid. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Postmodernism *is* a vague category; it would be wholly ironic to try and define it with passionate certainty since that is exactly what postmodernism seeks to critique. That being said, I don't see it as a synonym for meta humor or any self-referential or self-aware comedy. That was the crux of my comment. I consider--as I suspect many do--that postmodernism carries deeper meaning than that. 

Obviously I haven't seen "A Deadly Adoption," but I would expect it to be like an hour-plus SNL sketch lampooning the Lifetime movie clich. If that's all it is, would you really categorize it as "postmodern?"

And let's say you would. Fuck me for having a contrary opinion? I have been under the impression that the point of these comments sections was for discussion. If everyone is going to just upvote everyone they agree with and comment the same thing worded differently, what's the point? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Explain to me how any of that was the least bit pretentious, rude, or how it could sound "awful." 

*I tend to reserve*

As in me, my opinion. Not saying the other chap is wrong, but here's what works for me. 

I list a number of fantastic films that I consider prime examples of how I interpret postmodernism. What a dick. I mean really, who does that? /r/movies is for discussing movies, not... discussing... movies?

Finally, I simply state the definition of postmodernism from which I am working so that /u/I_AM_LOOKING_AT_YOU and others can understand where I'm coming from, and then I offer another potentially more accurate term for the aforementioned Lifetime movie.

There's nothing "pretentious" about my post. I politely disagreed with someone and explained exactly why. If that's pretentious, you'd have an awfully hard time having any conversation that isn't. </TEXT>

Insofar as I may be heard by anything, which may or may not care what I say, I ask, if it matters, that you be forgiven for anything you may have done or failed to do which requires forgiveness. Conversely, if not forgiveness but something else may be required to ensure any possible benefit for which you may be eligible after the destruction of your body, I ask that this, whatever it may be, be granted or withheld, as the case may be, in such a manner as to insure your receiving said benefit. I ask this in my capacity as your elected intermediary between yourself and that which may not be yourself, but which may have an interest in the matter of your receiving as much as it is possible for you to receive of this thing, and which may in some way be influenced by this ceremony. Amen.

	<TEXT> Yes, but celery has "negative calories." 

As a plant, celery stores its calories throughout its body, just as every other plant does. There are plenty of food calories in celery; the difference is that humans cannot adequately process those calories.

The majority of energy that celery has locked within it passes through our digestive system without being processed. The cellulose calories celery has is irrelevant; all that counts is the six or so food calories we can get from each eight-inch stalk. Since it takes more than six food calories of energy to digest the celery, the net result is that digesting celery does, in fact, exhaust calories. In a very real sense, celery is a "negative calorie" food. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  I believe that exposure to hyper-realistic violence in a controlled enviroment is a practical approach to parenting

Can you read that again and tell me you're actually being serious?

A four-year-old has no ability whatsoever to comprehend what he or she is seeing. Why would you show them at that young and impressionable age where they're still trying to make sense of the world people intentionally and purposefully doing wanton violence to one another? That's the impression you'd want a young child to have of the world? Just dash their innocence against the rocks right off the bat?

As for citing a source, I don't know how to narrow it down from [these 386,000](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=exposure+to+media+violence+children hl=en as_sdt=0 as_vis=1 oi=scholart sa=X ei=wlFsVYzBGMaagwTQtoP4CA ved=0CBwQgQMwAA), but feel free to pick the first three you like and peruse.

Here's a quote from the [first one](http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2006-23323-000): Anderson, Gentile, and Buckley describe the reaction of the games industry to scientific findings that exposure to violent video games and other forms of media violence constitutes a significant risk factor for later aggressive and violent behavior.

Here's a more [recent one from 2015](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1876285914003325): Child-reported media violence exposure was associated with physical aggression after multivariable adjustment for sociodemographics, family and community violence, and child mental health symptoms (partial correlation coefficients: TV, 0.17; video games, 0.15; music, 0.14). This association was significant and independent for television, video games, and music violence exposure in a model including all 3 media types (partial correlation coefficients: TV, 0.11; video games, 0.09; music, 0.09). There was a significant positive interaction between media time and media violence for video games and music but not for television. Effect sizes for the association of media violence exposure and physical aggression were greater in magnitude than for most of the other examined variables.

Here's another [recent study](http://scan.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2015/03/09/scan.nsv025.abstract): Media violence exposure causes increased aggression and decreased prosocial behavior, suggesting that media violence desensitizes people to the emotional experience of others.

This really shouldn't surprise anybody. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  The notion that hyper-realistic violence should not be exposed to children is utterly arbitrary

Not according to the many, MANY studies done on the subject, and your anecdote is meaningless; anecdotes are not evidence.

There are hundreds of thousands of studies I could link to supporting what I'm saying: a young child, a four-year-old, should *not* be exposed to the kind of violence depicted in Mortal Kombat.

Like I said, I'll take the downvotes, because fuck me for caring more about the welfare of children than... what? I don't even know why this warrants downvoting. I've been a fan of Mortal Kombat since the original hit arcades in 1992. I was eleven at the time. I've owned the home console version of all of them including X, but I don't play them in front of my now 5-year-old daughter because it would be grossly irresponsible bad parenting. </TEXT>

There are currently about 20-30 bottles of delicious water in my refrigerator at about 34 degrees F that I can grab and drink at my leisure. The containers are also convenient, because even if I'm on the go, I can crush them down to almost nothing and screw on the cap. They fit right in my pocket until I can find a proper receptacle. 

So, back to my original point, I use bottled water for the same reason I use floss picks rather than spool floss. Convenience is king. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't even consider it "soft" atheism. Atheism is just a-theism, i.e., without theism. I'm irreligious and I don't believe in god. That's what an atheist actually is, regardless of how many people try to define it on their own terms or make ridiculous line graphs. 

In other words, I'm not making any extraordinary claims. In spite of tons of reading, research, and opening myself up to many ideas, I see no evidence supporting the existence of god, nor do I see the need for one. I stop short of saying there is no god because that's impossible for me or anyone else to say meaningfully. There's no proof either way. 

God either exists and it's wrong to say god doesn't exist, or god doesn't exist and it's impossible to prove a negative. I can't prove pink unicorns that eat rainbows and shit butterflies *don't* exist, but it's perfectly reasonable for me to not believe in them.

Therefore, rationally, "I don't believe in god" is the only sensible statement. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Neither is correct. 

Atheists don't believe in god, but in the same way that there is no evidence for god, one cannot disprove a negative. While I certainly don't believe in gods or anything else without proof, I nor anyone else can claim with 100% certainty that an improvable thing doesn't exist. That is logically impossible.

That being said, one should rationally say "I do not believe in god" rather than making any factual statement that they do not exist or cannot exist.

Taking that to OP's point, there is a semantic difference between "I don't believe in god" and "I don't believe in God." The capitalized "God" is a specific one, and, in the United States, most often assumed to mean the Abrahamic God, an even more specifically, the Christian trinity god based on demographics. An lower-case "god" could refer generically to any god, goddess, or similar deity and is therefore a perfectly reasonable substitute. You don't need to pluralize "gods" any more than you'd need to say, "I don't believe in God, god, gods, goddesses, or deities of any kind."  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  I know where you can begin, reading comprehension courses.

Really? Because here's what you *actually* wrote:

Exactly, making Sue black would have been a lot less confusing. Some people don't seem to get that it has nothing to do with race and everything to do with fucking with the character's for what seems like no other reason than to be "edgy".

making Sue black would have been a lot less confusing

How is making Sue black *less* confusing? The only way her not being black could be construed as confusing is if you didn't grasp the incredibly simple concept of adoption or step siblings. This isn't hard.

fucking with the character's for what seems like no other reason than to be "edgy"

The only "fucking with the characters" (no apostrophe needed there) the filmmaker has done was to make Johnny Storm black, so that's you thinking black = "edgy."

I'm not the one in need of reading comprehension courses. If anyone needs an education here, it's you. </TEXT>

EDIT 1: Which movie version of Horton Hears a Who! did the Grinch appear in? There are two.

EDIT 2: Actually, I have to insist this theory sticks to the books only as there have been two Horton movies and two Grinch movies. The movies contradict themselves and it cannot be sensibly said that one is canon while the other is not. This is strictly a book theory. </TEXT>
