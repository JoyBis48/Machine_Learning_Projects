	<TEXT> I live in Bel Air, the group is leaving from Annapolis. The original plan was to pick me up on the way but they mentioned some tolls on the way to Hull, MA. They're thinking in order to circumvent tolls they would go the way of the Bay Bridge. This would totally bypass my location and therefore would need to drive an hour and a half to meet them in Annapolis. If I new how much the tolls were I could pay those.   </TEXT>

I know the article states the child was injuring himself, but you can't tell me the police needed to be called to provide a bearhug, come on. There are adults that can provide a bearhug until the agreed upon action plan is floored through as agreed (ie) called the parents baring any significant safety issues.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes that is correct depending on the state. The only two states I know allow BCBA's to provide services in the classroom are Florida and Pennsylvania. I would not suggest an aide as they serve more as an assistant rather than a board certified behavioral analysts. Look into what BCBA's do and see if that is right for you and your son, I'm sure it will be. Additionally, if you don't feel the classroom has BCBA or principals there are centers you can go to where they provide BCBA play based services with other children. Your sons transition into adulthood starts now and the curriculum they go through know will set them on their way.

Feel free with any questions. </TEXT>
