	<TEXT> That's alot of "might" and "maybe" and it presupposes that the intelligence we create is both able to be modified in such a way, that we'd have the know-how to do it, and that it isn't able to bypass it by some means. That's a tremendous, enormous risk. 

I'd honestly rather have an AI that had zero safety precautions in it than one with half-assed ones, because the one with zero we at least *accept and know* is dangerous. It's just like how bicycle helmets increase injury: if you think you're safe, you take unnecessary risks. 

It also, of course, presupposes that we're not stupid enough to have it accidentally destroy us with our own, perfectly reasonable requests. Which i have no faith in, personally.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think that - among all the literary genres - horror is the most flexible and most pliable in terms of format. That said, i think most creepy pastas are basically in the same vein as lovecraft's "At the Mountains of Madness" - a "true account" from the perspective of someone who's discovered something abnormal and either wants to document it or warn others off.

The other big format would probably be the "letters" format - where people communicate back and forth about some strange happening. 

both are pretty venerable formats, although updated to the modern age in the form of web pages and text messages instead of scientific journal entries and letters mailed back and forth. </TEXT>

First, most biker hits are loud, messy, and obvious. Biker gangs survive on fear, so they tend to not be very subtle in how they kill people. They'd mow her down in a public place or fire bomb her house or something, not just shoot her in the head on a quiet road. 

Second, how would they know where to find her to do the hit? 

Third, if they were tied up with a gang enough to get killed over it, you'd think there'd be some mention of that somewhere. It's not something they could keep quiet.  </TEXT>

Firstly, it sets up a divide between gun owners: sporting users and self-defense users. divisiveness is not something to be fostered.

Secondly, it opens the door to excluding or limiting weapons based on their (perceived) sporting use. Anything that places a limit on the type and form of firearm that can be made or sold is inherently wrong. </TEXT>

[This is a fairly recent study on it](http://www.vpc.org/studies/amroul2012.pdf) - PDF Warning.

I think the most important thing to take out of that is this line, though:

"Currently, no comprehensive national database or tracking system exists to systematically document the toll in death and injury of murder-suicide in the United States."

as to gender breakdown, though:

Of the 378 homicides, 288 victims were female, 89 victims were male, and the gender of one victim was not identified.

 the Calypso was in the Singapore harbor when a barge accidentally rammed into it, sinking the boat to the seafloor. It took days to bring it to the surface 

I mean the boat's been severely damaged, sank, stripped of it's entire outer hull. All that's left is the inner frame and a few parts. I'm not sure that you could call it "The Calypso" and be honest if it was restored - it'd practically be a new ship! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> yeah, if Okinawa was any indication, an invasion of the home islands would have been a screaming nightmare for everyone. We'd burned most of tokyo down and were firebombing japanese cities left and right, but it still would have been an awful struggle (i recall hearing estimates of a half-million dead american soldiers!) 

I think by that time *everyone* was done with the war and ready for it to end.  </TEXT>
