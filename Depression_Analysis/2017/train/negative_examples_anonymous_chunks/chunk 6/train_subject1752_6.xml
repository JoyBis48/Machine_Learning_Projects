	<TEXT> In the past couples didnt have a choice about whether or not to stay together; they were forced to by circumstance and the need for survival. We glamorize marriages from the past by pretending that people voluntarily stayed together, instead of acknowledging that the majority of people didnt have alternatives. In fact, many marriages in the past were not only highly dysfunctional, but highly abusive. So feeling nostalgic for the perfect marriages of the past is like feeling nostalgic for the time when money grew on trees. </TEXT>

she basically describes how she gave up her own desires in order to make her husband happy. She also says that if she were to do things over again, she would guard the things that she enjoys and the things that make her feel like herself.19


Women do give up much of who they are, but the reason is to accomplish their dream. Yet after they get what they want, women forget this fact and mistakenly think that they have given up and sacrificed in order to make their husbands happy.

I agree with Armstrong that marriage is the greatest conspiracy in modern history. However, in truth men dont fare any better than women, and to believe anything else is merely to buy into the conspiracy. </TEXT>
