	<TEXT> They will ban you and then accuse you of having an agenda. 

I got banned there for questioning why the mods removed my documentary critical of the Israel Lobby. The mods reactionary response was to accuse me of having a malicious agenda. When I responded by saying that their censorship of my submission was the implementation of an agenda on their part I was banned instantly. I tried appealing but with little success. It seems like they have a narrative there that they don't wish to see disproved and that agenda would appear to be:

	<TEXT> This is a great article. 

NBC News is such an utter shit show.

This completely dwarfs the Brian Williams scandal. Richard Engel is complicit in implicating the Assad regime and the Iranian government in his kidnapping during a time where US intervention in Syria was being debated in Congress. Engel absolutely knew that this would sway the American public in favor of intervening in Syria on behalf of the "moderate" rebels.  </TEXT>

They are attempting to keep their own citizens fearful of Arabs/Iranians/Palestinians. Elements within the Israeli defense department, most likely Mossad, don't want average Israelis to feel that bilateral progress was being made in the region with a treaty. This hoax topped the evening news in Israel, relegating the real story, the US treaty with Israel's nemesis Iran, to minor coverage, prioritizing it to a lower status than it truly is.  </TEXT>

She also researched how to detect bugs.

Yet she and Siddiqui continued to meet with the agent in the months that followed. Siddiqui purchased several propane tanks and stored them in her basement, and discussed them during the meetings. "I got everything up in this joint, I already told you. If you guys... once we learn... I got everything up in this joint," she allegedly said. "Yo, she got everything. This is like the Home Depot," the undercover agent responded."

For one thing, Yemen's ousted governments are the ones asking for Saudi intervention, to say that Yemen is going to invade Saudi Arabia is misleading to say the least.

You can't equate Iran-backed Houthi rebels to the Yemeni government and military.  </TEXT>
