	<TEXT> I won't know the difference if you put veggies in your "stock?"  That is laughable.  There is a reason that people wonder why restaurant  food is so good and they can't replicate it at home.  Stock is vegetable based.  What you are talking about making is broth, which is quite different from stock.  Not that it is bad or wrong, just two different things. </TEXT>

I was accused recently of "helping" a shop into the ground to liquidate it.  Sure sure, I bought gear after they closed.  But they were closing before I walked in there and there was nothing nobody could do about it.  Simple fact, some places should close.  But when it happens intentionally... </TEXT>

If you don't mind, where are you located? I'm just curious as I thought it was fucked out here.  Wanna talk about theft?  One shop here was paying $38k monthly in rent.  Yes.  That number is correct.  They did for years.  How/why is beyond me.  But it's currently in court and they got the rent *dropped* to $12k/monthly.  I'm in New Mexico BTW.  Not even NYC...

Making bacon is easy.  Before you graduate to doing hang cures and pancettas, give your hand a try at some quick cures, salt box methods, smokes, etc.  It'll give you a better grasp of what is happening during the curing/drying process.

Which book did you pick up?

FYI.  Talin has awesome small chunks of skin on pork belly.  The 99  has decent stuff too, but you have to go into that store.  Also, if you ask nicely, the kind folks at The Alpine Sausage Kitchen *might* have some whole belly to part with.  Other than that, check the carnicerias in the area if you want belly and don't have access to restaurant wholesalers. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> there are a Handful of rooms sectioned off with several bathrooms.  One of the things I thought of when I looked at the space was some additional kind of production for grocery stores.  It is basically Halfway between Albuquerque and Denver.  I know for a fact that shipping pickup either way is easy and relatively cheap based upon previous work.   Just a restaurant can be made sustainable to make payments and a living, anything else would be gravy.

I see so much oppertinity in the place for the right person and little investment.  It is too bad that nobody really wants to do small town America anymore.  Then again, maybe someone will swoop this place up and do it right... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not the owner.  Just someone who has walked through of the property and has chatted with the realtor.  This was about 5 months ago.  They can't get anyone to take the property.  If we were ten years older with kids, we would jump on this place.  But the rural lifestyle isn't for us, we are actually looking to move back to the city.  However, I know for many people, this is a dream.

Random place in the middle of fucking nowhere.  Raton, NM has a population under 7K on I-25 between Santa Fe NM and Denver, CO.  In all honesty, a prime location that someone could make a mint at.  Simply because it is just off the interstate in the middle of nowhere and with social media, it would be easy to drive traffic.

There are so many benefits to this property is is crazy.  A rancher just across the way with organic certification who raises pig, cow, chicken, and goat.  Multiple hippie farms in the area growing veg.  The community would kill for an awesome cook to move into town and set up shop.  For what it is, this place could be had for a steal IMO.

It is right on a main shipping route corridor.  Traffic count on the freeway is huge.  The area is beautiful with great access to skiing, back packing, mushroom hunting, and everything else landlocked outdoors.  The kitchen has brand new stainless.  There are buildings to spare.  Which, to me would mean two things.  Smokehouse and curing room.

This place isn't for everyone, but it is looking for a new home.  Maybe I'm just trying to pay it forward in helping someone else out.  Or maybe I'm just killing time until the next piece of wood needs to hit the coals...

Happy smoking saturday r/bbq!

	<TEXT> You can stop talking about federal and state funding.  The argument behind it is invalid.  Simply because we already place those funds in other areas.  The money is currently allotted.  It is about application of resources.

It is called capitalism and economics inside the manufacturing process.  For sometime, solar has been at the break even point.  However, because it hasn't been inside the consumer marketplace, you can't even discuss how profitable it is.  The simple fact (and this comes directly out of the mouths of the manufactures) that over half of the built solar technology never sees the sun, refutes the claim that it isn't "profitable."  We honestly don't know if it is, or isn't.

But tell me this.  How can you say is not profitable, when I/you/Joe Blow can outfit a house to be off the electrical grid here, pretty much anywhere in NM, for around $10K in material?  Would you like to rephrase your statement and say that solar isn't profitable for the companies that currently run our energy exchanges?  Or would you like to hold onto the stance of being a fucking dumbass? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As long as the old guard is in power, we won't have things like this.  The current NM administration is against alternatives to fossil fuels and will fight them every step of the way.

For example.  When the new Walmart was proposed to be built in Santa Fe, there was a community cry to demand that if construction was to be built, that water cisterns and solar panels be required on the building.  It was in traction in the city and county.  Martinez's team came in and squashed it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> To a certain extent, yes.  Can you control the environment in that way?  No.  It is a good trick for at home use, I do it all the time.  For those experimenting and getting a hang of how salt works, it is a good trick.  However, I would call the consistency of the mush I make to be wet salt, rather than salted water. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Most states allow for curing on site and selling directly via retail, but have different provisions for wholesale.  Standard safety procedures and they don't care about pink nothing.

Start with bacon and pancetta first.  Salt box cures, smokes, and short hangs.  Easy easy.  Move to duck prosciutto.  These 3 cures you can do open air in your garage if you like. Than move to coppa and other small whole muscle.  After that, start dealing with grinds.

You can set up a curing chamber for under $350 if you have a suitable fridge.  Double doors are best, but a beverage fridge works just fine. Don't have one? grab a refab for $200.  Just make sure the seals are good.  If you need instructions to build one and where to order the humidifiers and what not, let me know.

This shit is a science. But is has also been happening in caves along the seashore of the Mediterranean for ages. As others have said, you can kill people.  But chances are that you won't.

Don't bullshit with the nitrate and nitrites.  They are necessary.  They are dangerous.  But don't listen to anyone tell you that they are bad for you.  Science says otherwise and some quick research will help you educate others on the matter.

Curing meat is fun. </TEXT>

Two things will happen, both of which will give you a better sandwich.  One, your cheese will be melted and it will be hot through.  Two.  You will get a nice crispy and brown butter crust on the bread.  Seriously, give it a try.  This technique will enhance your skills/palate as a cook and simply improve your life through better sandwiches.  No bullshit.

	<TEXT> Don't be scared.  It's not rocket science.  Don't fuck with the humidifier in the garage, it's not worth it.  Specifically if you have things that you don't want damp.  I can help you set it up to where you can slide a pan onto a shelf and you're good.  If you're interested.  As long as you have an under 55 degree room, a child can set it up to do open air month long cures.  I mean, if they can read.  I always tell people that if you can bake cookies you can make bacon AND beer.

I've been curing meat in my garage, spare bedrooms, fridges, chambers, at salumi makers, and hanging up in a damn tree outside in the middle of winter for years.  Don't be scared.  Worse thing that is going to happen (if you're not a fucking dumbass) is you get a little belly gurgle.  Live a little.  Take a fucking chance.  People have been dealing with food this way for thousands of years.  I don't understand why people are so afraid of germs and bacteria.  Don't be afraid of Darwin.  Know and understand him and you'll do just fine ;)

Smokehouse.  You said a magic word there.  That is a different beast all together, 100%.  But, it is some of the same principles.  And if you still have access to a smokehouse, good for you.  That is a piece of history and Americana that most people have never even heard of.  And yet was a staple on every farm until the early 1900's... </TEXT>
