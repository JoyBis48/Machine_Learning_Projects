	<TEXT> I had to come into work last night, after working 8 hours, to work for another 10 hours. By the time I got home I had been awake for 27 hours. And the work I do, if you screw up...you could kill someone.

So excuse me if I don't shed a tear for you retail workers who have to work 10 minutes over time because someone needed toilet paper real quick. 

Edit: Of course I get paid well for my time. I work hard in uni, worked hard to get where I am and worked hard to get good pay for overtime. I also worked retail when was young. It was easy but I complained about it because I didn't understand what a difficult job was. I was just trying to point out that if a retail job making you stay back 10 mins is the worst thing in the world for you, no matter the pay, then maybe you aren't cut out for a more stressful job </TEXT>

Or if they decide not use the pram and instead just decide to carry the baby? Or what about all the mothers who take up all the spots leaving other mothers in the lurch?

The point I am trying to make is unless there are clear rules, enforced and punishable you don't have to do shit. The world doesn't owe you anything because you have a pram.

It's nice to take another spot if you find one, but I sure as shit am not going to drive around for 1/2 an hour and then park on the street because some parent might show up and want it. As with he case of many parents I see park there, they don't even use a pram! Their kids are walking around. Free game I say </TEXT>

It just seems that it would be harder to claim that they were definitely going to donate the money unless it was in writing. Feels like he said, she said.

Who knows what kind of debt her illness left him with. What if he relied on her income? She might not have had health insurance. 
So the money was for treatment...now it'll be for the funeral costs, medical expenses and helping this dude actually move on with his broken life. 

If there was fine print to all those peoples' generosity and he has broken that, then fine....but personally you would have to be heartless to ask for him to give it up </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hindsight, of course, teaches us many things, especially the consequences of bad decisions. But the point I was trying to make (and other people in the thread) is that it should have been clear to her that Sydney Road is way too busy to use a child's trailer on. I didn't call her a bad parent and I didn't say she deserved it, I just said it was a fair statement to make. 

Of course, saying that she shouldn't have been on Sydney Rd doesn't help her now, but it is what people are thinking. Maybe if she was thinking to do it again, or someone else, the reaction here might convince them to reconsider that choice. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Because if I do something unsafe in a place where unsafe things can lead to accidents, then I must take some of the blame.

But I do something safe, such as wear a miniskirt and some douche decides to rape me on purpose, then I cannot be blamed.

A rape victim can't change her actions to disuade a rapist...rapists gonna rape. She can't be blamed because he is a horrible POS.

Do you see women in dark alleys and think to yourself "What a stupid woman walking around here...I might rape her"?  </TEXT>
