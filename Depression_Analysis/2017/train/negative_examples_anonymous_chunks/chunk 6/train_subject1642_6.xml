	<TEXT> I've only found a hammer of God at one store, but the Buddha zephyr is pretty popular. There's also the fat Buddha which is geared more for flavor builds and there's the mangala which is a short version of the Buddha. All the parts for those 3 RDA's are interchangeable too which is nice. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well I'll hit it for a good 4 or 5 usually, the awesome thing about royal wire is it heats up super fast but it takes forever to get too hot. I've used a ton of different wires and royal is my favorite by far. If you build you should try it out! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Better than I expected honestly. I mean a higher resistance would be better but I'm completely satisfied. It's a bit warm but its not bad.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My favorite build is the hammer of God box mod with the Buddha zephyr. The Buddha has a MASSIVE chuff cap and handles heat realllyyyyy well, and the deck has deep juice wells. Also, tons of building space. I run 4 vtc5 batteries in the mod but vtc4s are pretty fantastic too. I get a bit less flavor but the clouds are just massive. I'm going to get a lot of hate for this but I've got a .03 ohm build on it and it's never been even remotely a problem. All together it cost me about 300 dollars.

My build is a 6 wrap dual parallel 20g royal wire, so lots of surface area with a super low resistance wire. Flawless on every front. I've been in 4 cloud comps with it and never lost one. It outperforms my 26650 el diablo mod with the mephisto rda which costed me 350 dollars not counting batteries, wire, and cotton. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've heard the head gasket goes out faster after you fix it, so for the same money I can swap the engine and solve the problem for a lot longer... Right? Is it true that the head gasket wears out faster after repairing it? </TEXT>
