	<TEXT> I should have been a bit more clear. The biggest reason I haven't been able to use the 5D for a while is because a lot's been going in terms of school hours, LSAT stress, and work issues. I haven't been able to focus on photography as much as I used to. Having an iPhone 5 (and then eventually an LG G2) helped fill that void since it's something I always have on me either way. 

It wasn't because of the iPhone 5 that I stopped using the Mark II. But I did start using the phone more when I had to stop using it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was focusing more on scenic photography when writing that article. When you're at something like a dinner with friends and you want to get a group photo taken, I don't care at all about using the flash. Someone else commenting on the article brought up the iPhone 5S as a good example. Flash can be helpful as hell when it's used at the right time.

It's the same way using flash on a DSLR is appropriate when you're shooting something like a wedding. That would be different from taking taking a picture of a scene you want to capture in its natural look. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey, guys! I'm the author of this article. I just needed to address a few things:

This isn't really an article I wrote for photographers. I wrote this for people that don't know anything at all about photography. A lot of my friends that want to do some photog as a hobby don't tend to have actual cameras. I wrote this for them as some basic tips so they could get a kickstart with their phones, at least.

The way I see it is most of the time people don't tend to think of their phone as an actual camera so they just treat it like a point-and-shoot, where they would probably try going into learning more about actual photography tips if they had a DSLR. I remember treating every picture I took on my phone like that before I started using a Canon.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> *I FORGOT ABOUT AFTERLIGHT.*

Ever since moving to Android, I've been waiting for it to come out on that. Afterlight is fantastic too, but I wouldn't use it for filters. The editing tools are what I love on it. They're the best I've seen on an app. I always took my photos for editing there, and then to VSCO for the finish. But yeah, Afterlight is definitely worth it.

As for the filter pack, look through VSCO's website and see how they describe the filters and what they're typically used for. It gave me a lot of ideas to start off with. A really useful thing I've also learned is if you've got a bit of noise noticeable in your picture, choose a filter that has a good fade to it. It takes out the noise and gives it your photo a more solid look.

	<TEXT>  Color balance. If there are people in your pictures, do them a favor and move the color balance to the right (warm) 2 or 3 ticks. It will improve their skin tone especially if your photo was taken under harsh light.

There's also a skin tone pack you can download for free! It adds a skin tone adjustment in the editing tools. I've been using it every time i have a picture with faces. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> An artist is someone who practices forms of expression through different mediums. Synonyms for the word 'artist' include 'creator' and 'originator'.

There's no specific guidelines to what makes something art. We're all artists, and we can only become better at it by working on us. What I wrote in that blog were just small guidelines and steps that someone can take in order to get themselves in the hang of the game. If your pictures aren't turning out like the way you see it, then build on it and find a way that works for you. You can't lose from there. You only lose when you tell yourself you're incapable of it. </TEXT>
