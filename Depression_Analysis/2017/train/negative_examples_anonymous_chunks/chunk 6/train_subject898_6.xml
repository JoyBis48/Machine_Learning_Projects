	<TEXT> I disagree with your unhelpful perspective.  To consider one perspective of the world wrong (a perspective that when examining the source material at its core, is used to promote love and selflessness) and consider another to be true without definitive answers, and to raise it up through anger, is outright hypocritical.  </TEXT>

Let me just skip ahead and let you know your Pun Thread is terrible, uncreative, and utterly bottom shelf humor. Seeing these threads is worse than seeing 'Cops' on G4tv. Which is gone btw, and most likely will soon happen to Reddit, because of worthless content like this. The pencil art is good btw. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm watching this and I've gone back and forth for SOoooo long. I truly feel regret and sadness for my sexual sin, and i turn from it for a time, then I return to it.

	<DATE> 2014-11-07 00:06:07 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Wanted to just make a list of sins that I've committed/am committing/will commit and secretly just need reassurance of my salvation. Honesty both ways here, thank you.

1.) Daily regularly user of pornography
2.) User of Tinder with the desire to meet somebody to have sex with
3.) Not a regular church goer and don't often consider holding the Sabbath as of high importance
4.) Often find fellowship with Christians to be disappointing and the Christians themselves to be boring/annoying
5.) Constantly searching for the best future for myself, serving myself.
6.) Drug and alcohol user, and often participate in social situations with the use of drugs and alcohol with non-believers. 

As I'm making this list, I don't mean to come off whiny or anything really. I just want those spiritually more sound than I to understand that my heart is willing, though I just generally suck and I'm not sure if my life will ever be that amazing transformation that you always hear about. If I continue in and out of these sins, will I be damned to eternal wrath? Will I ever be fully out of these sins? Can you pray for me? What do I need to do to be in right standing with God? Is there anything I can "DO"? </TEXT>

With the PetroDollar continuing to lead the US towards Iran, when do you think the US will invade? How will the US go about it? False Flag? ISIS propaganda? And if an occupation of Iran does occur, how long before Russia and China intervene? Will this be the fall of the United States or am I just sensationally offtrack?  </TEXT>

For humans, we are born into darkness and know not the sin we commit and its implications spiritually. Therefore, we go from darkness to light and the devil came from light to darkness.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've known Jesus as my savior for quite some time. I love what God has done for me, what God has taught me, and who God has turned me into. I was blessed to have made it through nursing school and am a male nurse at my local hospital with a steady job at a young age. There are no legitimate, outright issues or struggles within my life that are observable to the outside world. My only issue is, I feel that I have very little satisfaction with life. I spend 40+ hours a week at my job, with very little enjoyment. In my downtime between sleep, I spend at the gym working out, where I have very few social connections. On my days off, working nights, I usually waste the first day sleeping. The weeks are flying by and I feel as if though this life that Christ has given me is being wasted on the mundane and conventional. 

What is it that brings you, as a fellow Christian, satisfaction and fulfillment out of life?  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> There are so many educated individuals to learn from throughout the entirety of the nation, with mountains of their media populating the internet. Why has this one particular character, Neil deGrasse Tyson become such a prominent figure throughout the Reddit consciousness? With so many articles and videos being posted to this website on a second by second basis, how does one particular niche professor maintain a presence on the front page of multiple subreddits on a relatively consistent basis? Is there an underlying hive mind that regulates the postings within reddit, that if not adhered to are buried in downvotes? Doesn't this frequent perspective from a single source, although intelligent, generate a recycled confirmation biased among the user base? What is it about this character that draws such a fancy from some many Redditors? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Themes of the game aside, it's still a game. When I play max payne or gta, it is just fun to kill people. To play a shooter of any sort and enjoy it, only to knock another shooter for its themes is outright hypocritical. Just because this game "appears" to be deriving meaning or purpose from senseless violence, does not mean that the character couldn't have multiple layers. No matter the outcome, this argument has long been played out on the mainstream media thousands of times and really isn't worth running in circles over. Mental illness or taking violent action is a choice and studies have clearly shown that an artistic form of game media will not abruptly perpetuate those murderous actions. If the game is fun, let it be fun. If it crosses a few boundaries, let it do so with pride. Just don't let your kids play it and we'll all be fine ;)     </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I apologize ahead of time for being so ignorant. 

I only watch the news in passing at work, and all I can say is, I'm so fed up with the lies and scare tactic propaganda that I feel almost all news outlets are force feeding down the American public's throats.

Am I wrong to say that men in black garbs and turbans with AK47s shown marching on television seems to be the biggest load of horseshit I have ever seen generated in the mainstream media narrative thus far? For the longest time, I was waiting for another 9/11 false flag to happen, enabling our military free reign to invade the remaining middle eastern countries such as Syria - and then a more prepared nation, distrusting of official stories would begin to stand against our misleading government. But now, there comes the story of journalists getting beheaded, and stories of "terrorists" murdering their own people, and that's all that's required for the U.S. to begin airstrikes on "select" Syrian targets? And not a god damn peep from the general public? And this all happens right around the 9/11 anniversary, when public "emotion" is at its highest. I just can't keep the story straight anymore. It's just all so ambiguous and makes no sense.

I also disdain the fact that our public still believes in fairy tales of good and evil, as if there exist no grey areas, and the ones WE bomb are the ones who deserve it. It's just so disheartening to know that I am part of  such a violent and uneducated public who still calls themselves Christian yet pulls the trigger everyday; and a government that would rather spew lies directly to our faces than ever considering standing up against big corporate business interests in foreign countries. 

It's almost like I'm living in a dream anymore. A dream where there is no hope for the people, and all there is to expect from life is small culminations of human hate and greed. How did it come to this? 

Please help me make sense of all this. All opinions are welcome. I just don't know who to trust anymore.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The validity of the text is essentially nullified based on the fact that the article itself states that the text was possibly authored 800 years after Christ's life on Earth. That's like me writing a document stating that Jesus had laser vision and someone digging it up in the year 3200 AD, calling it valid strictly based on the fact its now a document of antiquity. Can we seriously think for ourselves people? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Watch [Zeitgeist debunked](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFI6m6Icav4) , a lot of what you're stating is fabricated to fit the agenda of the Zeitgeist creator. Also, to say Jesus didn't exist, even as a historical figure is outrageous. And stating, "those who 'came to arrest him' could never find him because he didn't virtually exist" is a logical fallacy because you're pulling accounts from the Gospel source material to refute the source material. It makes no sense.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you've made it thus far, you're probably curious what happened to the rest of the puppies. Yup, dead. All dead. Eaten by Guildabeasts. Yeah, I know sad right? Should have listened to blazetheraze and stopped reading. What's a Guildabeast, you ask? It's a big gay guy with a tiny dick and hooves for feet used to carry out painful erotica bullshit. Yeah, I know, fucked up right? Should of just stopped reading like blazetheraze told you. But since you've made it this far, you should be aware that the Jews did 9/11 and you're retarded if you don't even question the official 9/11 commission. And by retarded, I mean you're a fearful bastard who probably will flag this comment, strictly on the basis that its "Stepped over its bounds" and will offend poor little grandma. Well, you know what? Fuck grandma. She was a dumb Slut just like mom. She got pregnant and fucked up her dreams before she was 20, but I suppose that was more "commendable" back then, huh? Well, sorry to break it to ya, but having kids, growing old and dying is a waste of life. You haven't even figured out your own self and now you wanna bring another life into this world so you can vicariously live through them and impart all your insecurities into their innocent heart? Also, make sure they go to college and get an "education". Because we all know 50k in student loans is the best way to teach someone that committing suicide would be a lot easier than this bullshit. So, the cycle repeats. What fun? Well, thanks for joining me and remember to stick your head in the sand when any real truth is placed in front of you. :)


tl;dr -  You should have listened to blazetheraze and just stopped reading. </TEXT>
