	<TEXT> "The FBI has been telling us only pedophiles use encryption, so of course we didn't use it..."

 Mike Rogers, the former chairman of the House intelligence committee, said last week that Chinese intelligence agencies have for some time been seeking to assemble a database of information about Americans. Those personal details can be **used for blackmail**, or also to shape bogus emails designed to appear legitimate while **injecting spyware** on the networks of government agencies or businesses Chinese hackers are trying to penetrate.

Interesting that he believes all of that. I don't recall him advocating against NSA gathering all of the same information about Americans because of those same reasons. Oh right, the "good guys" would never use that same information for those purposes. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The chip is more like ~1.3GHz with Turbo-Boost up to 2.3Ghz. The max speed isn't always activated.

Also, the fact that Intel has to do emulation for many apps means that the chip will perform less well than otherwise, and it will also [consume more power](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/05/02/arm_test_results_attack_intel/):

 The results weren't pretty: when using binary translation on this CPU-centric benchmark, power consumption went up nearly 90 per cent and performance dipped by over 40 per cent. </TEXT>

I don't think it would be complicated at all. They could probably just open up a special port on Android that only works for ads. Plus, Google owns Admob, which represents lie 75% of the ads on Android apps, so they could "force" the change pretty easily. </TEXT>

It's just that in the winter holiday season, the iPhone manages to get like 5% or so extra market share, and then Android drops to 47-48%, and many Apple-loving tech sites point to that as "Apple growing and Android losing" in the US. But then they fail to write about how the numbers jump back up to over 50% for Android a quarter later. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This happens all the time too - I mean those connected to the NSA for instance, leaking classified information to the media that makes the NSA or the government *look good*. But somehow nobody is calling for *those* people to be put for "endangering national security" in prison or even assassinated for leaking the data.

I think it's even emerging as some kind of litmus test. Are those in the media trying to discredit the personality of the leaker and call for his assassination or arrest? Then it must be great leak for the population. If not, then the government probably had a hand in it and is trying to manipulate us through that leak. </TEXT>

For instance, Cameron and Tories hardly mentioned their surveillance plans during the election, so they got elected for different reasons, but within a week of getting elected passing new surveillance laws seems to be by far the main priority of the party. So why wouldn't you think that's the main reason for killing the HRA too? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think it's important we at least make it explicitly clear in laws what they can and can not do. The problem is they may be using other programs or have different interpretations, which is why transparency and oversight is also very important. So we need to get more people like Ron Wyden in the Intelligence Committees, and fewer people like Dianne Feinstein, so we can know if they are actually obeying the laws as intended or not.

We also need to *actually cut* NSA's funding by a significant margin (at last half say over the next 3 years). I mean if we're going to stop some of the major "mass surveillance" programs, then they won't need as much budget, right?! Otherwise if we leave them that budget they could just restart the *same* programs under different names and in different locations. Starve the NSA of resources to the point where it *only* has the necessary resources for targeted surveillance. There should also be regular audits (twice a year) of NSA's expenses by the Intelligence Commitee's staff.

So it's not impossible to rein on the NSA. But it does require a lot of political will and some good systems in place to ensure that they *can't* now that they "won't" do some stuff.

We also need to *start punishing people*, even with prison, when they break those laws, which again requires political will, and therefore a lot of activism from us. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I wonder if in the past year or so, worrying that the Patriot Act might actually expire, the NSA/FBI started putting everyone "under investigation" just so it can continue spying on all when the Patriot Act expires, thanks to this "grandfathering" feature. </TEXT>
