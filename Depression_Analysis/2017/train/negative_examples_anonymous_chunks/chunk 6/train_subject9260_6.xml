	<TEXT> Here is the thing.

Sometimes a ban is necessary. If you post naked pictures of children, you should be banned.

If you post the name, address, and photo of a person, with a message like "someone needs to rape this bitch", you should be banned.

If you upload videos of yourself killing people, you should be banned.

Of course, they should also send the information to the authorities.

So, you can't promise "No Banning, whatsoever" without opening yourself up to legal liability.

The goal we should be striving for is "if it is legal, you can post it" </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I went down to the car dealership for one of these promotions. I brought in the ad, they did their high-pressure sale, then they brought me a scratch-off with like 20 numbers on it, and I got to scratch off 6 numbers.

If *all 6 numbers* matched a pre-determined list of numbers on a whiteboard, then I would have won the grand prize. And quite frankly, I'm skeptical that the scratch-off was even possible to win on. (The booby prize was a $2 bill.)

Does anyone know *anyone* that "won" more than a $100 product on these things?

The worst one I've seen has a prize listed as "3 golden coins" (They meant Sacajawea dollar coins.)  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  a couple of fries per day

That implies a restraint on eating that bodybuilders don't generally have.

[This](http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/the-abcs-of-a-muscle-building-diet.html) article on bodybuilding.com shows the "recommended" diet for a bodybuilder who wants huge muscles...

For the 180 lb person in the example, they suggest a 3500 Calorie daily diet, including 180g of protein, 450g of carbohydrates, and 120g of fat.

Compare that to the standard weight-maintenance diet for a 180 lb person, 2000 Calories with no more than 300g of carbs and 65g of fat. Protein doesn't have a recommendation, but 180g is the equivalent of 30 eggs or about 9-15 hamburgers. </TEXT>

Rome was built on a peculiar formation of 7 hills, where the Vatican sits today. The horns and crowns represented Roman leaders and countries they ruled over.

	<TEXT> You have things too convulted.

Timeline A: Sarah and unknown individual create John, Yadda Yadda. Skynet sends T-800 to the past. John-A sends Kyle Reese after it. (The events of Timeline A continue, so your Timeline B never occurs.)

Timeline B- Terminator 1. Sarah-B survives the T-800, has John, and is committed to a mental institution for claiming that robots from the future came back in time. John-B is raised by foster parents, and becomes more street smarts than John-A. John-B joins military service like many tough kids, and starts the resistance, along with Katherine Brewster. Skynet is accelerated by the remnants of the T-800, and sends a T-1000 to attack John. John sends a reprogrammed T-800 to defend himself.

Timeline C - Terminator 2. T-800 saves John and breaks Sarah from the mental institution, and forms a fatherly bond with John. T-800, T-1000, and all physical remnants are destroyed. (We assume.) Sarah trains John until she dies of cancer, John lives off the grid. Skynet is created in parallel construction by Katherine's father. John survives Judgement Day by not being in a major city, founds the resistance. Skynet sends a T-X, Katherine sends a reprogrammed T-800 to protect.

Timeline D- Terminator 3. T-800 saves John and Katherine from T-X, attempts to stop Skynet from launching, gets them to a military bunker, where John founds the resistance. This is a 100% stable timeline, as Skynet is not hindered or helped in any way. It is as if they never sent back the T-X at all.

Where things get wonky is in the fact that the new movie has Skynet and the Resistance send fighters to *before* the events of Terminator 1, removing 2 and 3 from existence entirely. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [Mr. Robot] Elliott is Mr. Robot. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-07-02 16:41:02 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Based on what little the show has told us so far, it seems to me that they are going full "Fight Club" and having the leader of the anonymous hacker group, Mr. Robot (played by Christian Slater) be a projection of Elliott's subconscious.

We have evidence that Elliott is an unreliable narrator. He is delusional, giving us narration as if talking to a voice in his head, goes on rambling conversations in his mind, and subconsciously hears every reference to "E Corp" (obviously a reference to Enron) as "Evil Corp", including in print. He is also a drug addict, who thinks his addiction is under control.

He encounters the hacker group when finding a file in one of his company's client's computers, and is almost immediately taken under the wing of Mr. Robot. Mr. Robot is cool, amicable, friendly. He gets along with others, makes plans, follows his goals. He is everything Elliott is not.

Almost immediately after this encounter, the CEO of Evil Corp is arrested based on evidence found in the hacker's program. Elliott, who only recently was let in on the plan celebrates as if he orchestrated it.

One of the girls in the group, seemingly second in command, is comfortable enough to take a shower at his place without telling him, as if they had known each other for a while.

All signs point to Elliott and Mr. Robot being the same person, with any direct interaction of the two (like when Mr. Robot pushed Elliott off the pier) being shown to us through the delusional filter of Elliott's mind. </TEXT>

And the statistics are not wrong, many men with body image problems turn to weightlifting. Why? Because we have to contend with amazingly large people! Arnold, Stallone, Lundgren, Farrigno, Tyson... the pressure isn't *usually* to get smaller, it is go get ripped.

When they work hard at the gym, and buy all the suppliments, and end up with only modest (realistic) gains, they turn to synthol and steroids to get bigger and better defined.

There are women with synthol and steroid problems, and men with eating disorders, but at least they are trying to address the overall problem. Body Image. </TEXT>

Of course not! They'd be dead quicker than you can blink.

Any reasonable person will admit that you can't claim personal freedom as an excuse to attack another person, and that includes passive harm.

Similarly, the First Amendment is not an absolute protection of your right to speak, specifically where such speech can bring harm to another party. You can not, for example, grab a bullhorn and tell an angry mob to break into a building and lynch its occupants.

Such exceptions to personal freedom are inevitable, and should be as limited as possible, but for vaccines to work *as many people as possible have to get the vaccination*.

If you don't want to vaccinate your kids, you will have to use alternative methods of educating them. You can find a private school that is willing to have a walking virus incubator attend, or you can teach them yourself at home. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Okay. The problem at heart is "personal liberty". If you have a deeply held belief that you should not be vaccinated, who are they to tell you otherwise, right?

Well, personal freedom only extends to your own person. If your freely taken action brings harm to another, then you can not take that action.

The Libertarian school of thought states that such limitations should be as narrow as possible, and that interpretations of harm to others should be imminent and foreseeable. In that regard, your child not vaccinating and spreading a disease is *foreseeable*, but not imminent.

The Socialist school of thought is that limitations should be as broad as is necessary, and that harm be merely reasonable, and not imminent. It is reasonable to the average person that an unvaccinated child could become the vector for an outbreak, especially as it has happened recently.

Any good government must weigh both sides of this, and in their opinion (whether they are correct or not is a different matter) is that the protection of the people, as a whole, outweighs the risks to any one individual and the infringement of the usual right to personal freedom. </TEXT>

Most people call any costuming "cosplay", partly because anyone who dresses up as a character is going to generally act like the character for pictures or among groups.

Those few who distinguish between them will generally draw the line at the dedication of the player. Buying a polyester, premade costume is just wearing a costume. Making or buying show-accurate or reimagined props and costumes is cosplay.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Actually no. The only gate with the appalation "Eye of a Needle" (or anything similar) was built in the 16th Century, and was named for the allegorical understanding that you mention.

The idea of large animals passing through a needle's eye as a euphemism for impossibility was used in Jewish tradition long before Jesus's time.

The point of the story was to say "Do what I (Jesus) say, and follow God, and He will do the impossible for you." </TEXT>

But it is extremely unlikely that it would result in human-compatible aliens.

Some things may or may not be inevitable, such as bipedal movement, but things like human skin color, hair patterns, and such are probably optional, even in intelligent species.

For example, elephants on earth evolved their noses to be able to grasp and manipulate objects while maintaining their mass and quadrapedal movement. The same thing could happen on a different planet.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think I understand what he/she was going at...

One of the big arguments in the gay community is that homosexuality is not a learned behavior, but a hard-coded preference. That men don't *choose* to like men, they just do.

The gay man in the argument said, "Who I choose to marry is none of your business." (I'm cleaning up the language because it isn't being told by a reliable narrator anyway.)

The bigot then has an a-ha moment, "But gay isn't a choice! So can you or can't you choose to be gay?"

The logic is there, if *and only if* you conflate the loving of a particular man with the loving of men in general. </TEXT>

If these were aliens that came to Earth to invade, they would have noted that the land was 90% incompatible to their lives... 75% of the land is covered in liquid water of varying salinity, and across most of the land, water falls from the sky.

But, going with the "demons" theory, and the idea that the little girl was creating and stashing holy water around the house (as opposed to it being simple human water), then it would explain why they are on *this* planet to begin with. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> [This article](http://www.ushistory.org/us/21e.asp) gives a quick and dirty idea of what was going on.

Britain was wildly interfering with American independence by way of naval blockades and forts within American Territories where they armed Native fighters against us. When Madison declared war in 1812, it was to gain economic freedom to trade and deal with other countries.

And we very nearly lost, if it weren't for important rallying points, like Baltimore and New Orleans. Granted the effects of a loss may not have ultimately included direct subjugation, but we still would have been largely dependent on the British Empire. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Go-Busters was fun, and had some interestingly serious parts interspersed. If OP doesn't know, they are a special ops team trying to save the world from an interdimensional threat caused by their parents. The comedy is mostly from their "weaknesses" and their Extra Members.

ToQger is a celebration of silliness with powers deriving from imagination.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you have seen Zyuranger and Kyoryuger, then pick up Abarenger and Go-Busters, then you'll be ready for Kyuryuger vs Go-Busters: The Movie (Abarenger is mostly optional, as they aren't as prevalent as the two titled Sentai). </TEXT>
