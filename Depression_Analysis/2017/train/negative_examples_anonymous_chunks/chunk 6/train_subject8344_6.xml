I posted about this before:

* https://www.reddit.com/r/Maine/comments/3bodcn/hey_maine_an_awesome_family_really_needs_your_help/


But now we are looking for something more permanent for them. They have good jobs, are good people and just need a place **immediately** to move into. We have the proper funds but need something affordable and right away.

Please help me find this family a place. They are currently in a hotel and need something to move into now. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If the clerk's office had another person that would issue the license there all the time, that would be fine. But that is not the case. These people are being told they have to go to another county. As long as the service is provided, then it would be up to the office there to decide if they want to keep her. But many places are not going to hire two people to do the job of one.

And with the McDonald's analogy, if the employer wanted to hire someone knowing that they would just do fries, that would be up to the employer. Not the employee. </TEXT>

 Its a deep-rooted conviction; my conscience wont allow me to do that, Davis said Tuesday. It goes against everything I hold dear, everything sacred in my life.

Well that is fine and dandy. I have no problem with that honey. But you obviously have to get a new job then.

If it is against my religion to eat cows, I can not work at McDonald's and refuse to sell people hamburgers.

	<TEXT> Thanks for your response. We are having some luck here and the people of Maine are impressing the hell out of me. Some very kind people there. 

They will arrive in the state tomorrow and hopefully one of these leads will pan out. If not they may have to so what you suggest. Having the four girls will prove difficult. they can't leave them in the woods while they go to work. But we are working on a solution.

And by-the-way:

Happy Cakeday!

	<TEXT> I am the head mod over at r/assistance where we help people in amazing ways due the the awesomeness of reddit..


Currently we have a family, one that is very dear to me and I will vouch for wholehearted. Actually it is one of my long time mods who has helped hundreds of others. The husband and wife worked at the same place and long story short they lost their jobs due to a very unruly owner.

The two have both found new jobs in Biddeford. They start Friday. They have packed up all their belongings and are currently in Vermont heading that way. But they have no place to stay. I have found arrangements for them and their four girls, and two small dogs as of July 7th. But they need a place to stay until then. Even someone's backyard. 

They start their new life but need help with a place to stay for the week so they can go to work. The last thing we want is for them to screw up on the new job. It was a magnificent break for them both to get jobs there.

Again these are good people and they just need to get through this tough time. For now, all we need is place for them to stay this next week. Maybe somewhere in Biddeford, Alfred, or Saco.

They really need your help. Please open your hearts and help me help them. I personally guarantee they are a good honest family. I am lucky to call them friends.  </TEXT>
