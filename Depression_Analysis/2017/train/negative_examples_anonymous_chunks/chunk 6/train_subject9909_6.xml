	<TEXT> From at least the perspective that humans are rational and have natural rights which extend from their capabilities rather than their needs, yet a government has to impose force to curtail those rights in favor of the needs of other humans for the purpose of civil society.

Society can be civil without central government, but people have a hard time imagining what it would look like since it has been so long since any group of people has lived like this. In the end, there is no central government tying the entire human race toether so we are all effectively anarchists, anyway.

	<TEXT> It is telling that instead of considering whether people should be paying taxes for this or not, you went straight to talking about how goosenecking money through administrative channels should not be forgotten when considering how people will be forced to pay for their healthcare through taxes, as if that was terribly different from being forced to pay any other way.

*The simple fact that healthcare is perceived, by you, like a universal public service instead of a commodity is really something.* I'm very interested that your reasoning is not purely ideological at the surface, and I have to agree with what you say in many ways.

But it is the way America has treated it's healthcare and nutritional guidelines which is horrendous. People treated healthcare like a public service and the public servants got it wrong (as humans are known to make mistakes and/or be corrupt). One set of rules across the country and a news service to back it up then made sure that nobody was breaking dogma and getting away with it. If deciding how to treat the sick and feed ourselves wasn't managed on a national level, we'd have shaken off our stupor by now through competition and offering more options. Instead we basically became a technocracy on the mental and nutritional health fronts for eighty years. The externalities of poor decisions in these areas is extremely dire, no doubt, but would not be so severe at the present period if the incorrect funding levels, subsidies, and programs had not been held above competition. Long before now, the evidence would have made it clear mental patients needed more supervision and less psychotropic drugs, saturated fats and cholerserol are not evil and are not well managed by statins, and the general state of medical insurance is a gaping wound in American finance practice no matter which way it is looked at.

I'm not going to say I haven't looked at the data, not that I should know exactly which data you mean from the perfectly broad statement, but why would data make anything more clear given what we agree on? You don't know me, but I have listened and read up on the different views.

What we have is a difference of philosophical opinion, and I'm not sure you accept that, nor understand the consequences.

You are opining government is the best and only way to provide healthcare, it seems. I do not share that conclusion. The place we really disagree is probably the definition of rights. I want to know how you think a democracy can operate when that most basic of assumptions is contested?

And, btw, you never asked me to "question the claim stated in the last statement of your first paragraph." I asked you a question and you obliged. Thank you for that. I kinda riled you up. I wanted an answer so I did that on purpose. Rand used very strong language, and was ultimately making a flawed argument as it is heard in the [video.](http://www.help.senate.gov/hearings/diverting-non-urgent-emergency-room-use-can-it-provide-better-care-and-lower-costsd) I just found the entirety of the video and will be reviewing it. Without the context of philosophical matter supporting it and cushioning it, which I am not sure he even provided in the hearing, the argument is laughable on the face. That doesn't mean the statement he intended was, necessarily. </TEXT>

Sweden: History of economic conservatism. The boat is slowly turning back that way, as well. Last decade it became apparent in policy circles that the honeymoon with socialism was ending.

Norway: Can you say oil? Oil.

To note how much these populations still pay in taxes is to realize how much the socialist state requires. Factor in the differences between us and them and you see the price would be higher here. More cronyism, more economic stagnation, less oil per capita. Americans are not prepared to give that much - just like our government is not prepared to handle it. </TEXT>

Did you alter your diet? Splurge on something?

Have you tried baking soda, vinegar, lemon juice, etc other home cleaners? Maybe your hair needed more than a hot water rinse, maybe it was actually dirty - or maybe your scalp was. Maybe you didn't brush for a day. Maybe the temperature changed with the season.

I keep a sulfate and silicone-free shampoo around in case my hair gets really bad, like if I decide to use Brylcreem and then need to remove it or I go swimming or to a construction site.Sometimes a day in the inner city or on the farm makes my hair dirty enough. If I need to clean, then a light application is all I use. </TEXT>

The plow has ruined entire civilizations. That doesn't mean nations or cities... it means economies. The Bronze age ended in famine and war because the plow created a technology bubble. But instead of money, it was a bubble of human population. The soil eroded away into the valleys and seas and then people died.

Go 31 min into that video and you'll see how not all agriculture decimates soil. Note that the graph only shows erosion, not soil growth. </TEXT>

Hi, I'm youngest member of the BCRCC! Make a comment in the comment box when you purchase online saying *Patron Vectras* sent you and that doesn't mean you have to sit with me, but it will be nice to say hello.

	<TEXT>  This is another case of creating more problems than actually resolving. By further limiting the already limited parking situation downtown and within the Inner Harbor, you place more vehicles on the road at any given moment whom are all actively fighting for already limited parking spaces.

I agree with you, here. Without ample street life, the city still requires weeknight and weekend injections of commerce and places for parents to park in the day to take children to attractions. Removing parking garages can be done after all the other problems are met and mass transit projects have been completed. Parking *lots*, however, are a blight. The ones in Mount Vernon seem to be hanging around because of management, profit margin, or fear of failure issues. </TEXT>

For instance, wherever you find a gathering of gentlemen with canes you can be sure at least some will tap it on the floor or a desk in applause rather than the relatively guttural reaction of hand clapping.

	<TEXT> I think it is very important to learn that carbohydrates either are already sugars or the human body converts them to sugars and that sugars are addictive. Sugars, particularly fructose, have various proven effects on the human brain and some deleterious ones which require more studies. What is known is that sugars trigger more "happiness" signaling chemicals. Eating them consistently makes the receptors matching these chemicals partially close, making the effect of all triggers lessen.

A calorie-restrictive diet based on carbohydrates will leave people hungry and lacking "happiness" chemical reception. Willpower is not possessed and/or planning is not accessible to everybody in the amount required to follow their chosen diet. I think being hungry *and* depressed at the same time is what causes people to fail to follow their own goals.

EDIT: Re-wrote second sentence, second paragraph. Original: "The willpower or planning that it takes to follow this kind of diet is not possessed and is not accessible to everybody." </TEXT>

They sterilize and get the scalpel... and boy, I feel that tugging. These guys are cutting my skin and I can't feel any pain but I can feel *everything else.* POP!

A little pus explodes on to the mat they have down. The guy cutting says "Oh, that was cool. A big one." His assistant just nods and mutters, "yup."

They milk more out of it and then clean it and stuff paper in it. A bandage goes on and I'm outta there.

It is really weird to experience things that would normally have one sensation. Like, if your finger wasn't frozen you probably would not have heard the sound. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The ACA has two main ideas.

* require every person to get insurance

* thousands of pages trying to make it easier for people to get insurance through personal means, employers, or state assistance.

Notice how it does not say that the state must provide health care; it says the individual must acquire health care.

IMO, health care is a debacle because of two things. Pharmacuetical, medical insurance, and hospital companies are protected from competition by lobbying the government and professional licensing associations. The companies are using the state to make mioney off us, which is not capitalism. The other problem is our perverse attachment to employer-provided healthcare. This started being a thing in WWII, but the job market has changed drastically and it makes no sense for offices and restaraunts to offer this when people might change jobs yearly. Every three years is common. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, this guy was all "We can do everything without a government, which even the founders called a necessary evil... so why have a government?"

Watched a bunch of lectures on Youtube and then /r/Anarcho_Capitalism .

But just like President Vit J. I'm willing to be practical. Hell, I'm a member of the local Republican Central Committee. They do not know me so well as to know my inclinations. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Professionals and biochemists, what is the process our body goes through to eliminate designated proteins? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> I have a coconut allergy. Why does it take so long for the rash to go away? Is the process the body goes through for eliminating proteins recognized as allergic inefficient? Is it hard for the body to designate a protein for elimination? Do our bodies make the molecules inert and then remove them?

If anyone has literature or links, I would appreciate them.

I know all about allergies up to the point where antibodies are supposedly attaching and capillaries have dilated to send in the white blood cells... but I can't find anything that tells me what happens next.

I think even if I got some keywords, I'd be able to find literature. </TEXT>
