Only 23 percent had a documented psychiatric history of any kindwhich means three out of four did not.] (http://www.psmag.com/health-and-behavior/actually-know-connections-mental-illness-mass-shootings-gun-violence-83103).

	<TEXT> Lurker making a post, forgive me if I missed answers to this. I played some lacrosse in high school, now finishing school in Boulder after deciding against the CU club team because of time restraints. I've been itching to get back into play and have come across some boulder leagues. I was wondering if anyone here plays in them and has recommendations. I'm not sure what gear I have left from high school but I know I'll need a new stick and helmet.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah our men's club could easily make the jump. I'm not saying they would be an immediate power house, but they could compete. They won nationals in 2014, lost in the final last season. Women's moved to d1 via title ix and do decently but were a shitty club team beforehand. We have everything in place for it to happen, they just need to navigate title ix restrictions. A rivalry would easily form between CU and DU. 

The Denver outlaws pro team won a title recently, DU won ncaa, Colorado and CSU have recent club titles, ncaa regional was in Denver, world games were here last year. It's getting big in Colorado  </TEXT>

You should look into mini packs. It's $77 for 3 games but you could get better seats if you pay a bit more money. I highly recommend going to the Rocky Mountain Showdown. It isn't a huge crowd but there is plenty of hate to go around, especially with recent years. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Are you in the Boulder area? Those tickets will be "harder" to come by. I say harder because season ticket holders and students won't be giving up their tickets, USC has a huge alumni base in Colorado, and Oregon has random fans everywhere. 
Best advice, don't get tickets in the visitors area, those are the worst seats in the stadium. I would just go to the Folsom box office web page and buy tickets before season starts. Sure you could get some scalped tickets a few days before the game but the could be more expensive.  </TEXT>
