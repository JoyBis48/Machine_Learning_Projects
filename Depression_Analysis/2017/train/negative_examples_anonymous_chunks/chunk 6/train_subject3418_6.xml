	<TITLE> [TOMT][MOVIE] Arabic movie about a guy juggling two girls. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-03-14 01:16:27 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> In December 2012 I was on a Saudia Airlines flight and watched an Arabic movie (subtitled in English) about a guy who had sunglasses and goatee. He was a concert promoter or something and got with a girl singer, but then later got bored and got with a new girl he hired. Then he ends up in the hospital with amnesia and the girls get together to trick him and pay him back.

For some reason I thought the movie was Egyptian, but I could be wrong. I also thought the main actor was a comedian named BoBo or BoPo or something like that...

Any ideas? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You should go to [SongMeanings.com](http://www.songmeanings.com )

Look up whatever song you're interested in, and there's usually some pretty good insights by people that post on there. 

You should also do "We Didn't Start the Fire" Billy Joel. People of his generation were being blamed by older generations for their lose morals and other social problems, and the song was a response to say "look at all this shit that's gone on through history...it didn't start with us". Plus teachers love Billy Joel ;-) </TEXT>
