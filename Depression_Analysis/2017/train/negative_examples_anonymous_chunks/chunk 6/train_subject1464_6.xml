	<TEXT> Please don't take my realism for pessimism. I just want you to understand your own goal. And yes, there is no reason you can't be published by the end of the year. Start collecting small presses and indie publishers  email adresses right away. The more places you can send to, the better your odds of a follow up and perhaps a publication.

P.S. I know all about the 40 thing, turning 41 in a few months. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You sound like me 2 years ago. First lesson I had to learn was, publishing traditionally takes a long time. Up to 2 years isn't unheard of. If someone accepted your work today, you might be lucky for an end of the year release. 

If you want to send me a sample, I would be happy to look at your work. But my opinion is only as good as you want it to be. Your opinion is the only one that really matters. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Everyone is a bad writer.

To someone.

Hell, there is a redditor that went out of his way to DL one of my free works just so he could leave me a terrible review. Just for spite. 

Does that make me a bad writer? Of course not. It just shows the point that no matter what you write, someone is going to not like it. 

Take any one of Kings work for instance, and pull up the one star reviews on Amazon. I will bet you an e-book that he has dozens of them. 

Thing is you really can't tell if you are a bad, good, or great writer until you have written something. Then written something else, and something else. 

So get to writing. </TEXT>

That's when you have no choice but to stand on a street corner, hold your own work in the air and say to the world, "Am I good enough?" 

Even though the act of doing so will open the flood gates to those who will shoot you down, unplug you from a distance, just because they can. </TEXT>

It only took five beats from the moment he jumped, but those seemed an eternity.


One.


The wind punished Aiden, shoving, and wrenching at his ruined clothes.


Two.


His arms stretched out, the magic building around him forming a bubble in time.


Three.


The scene of a potential deadly future burned themselves into his memory, even with eyes closed against them.


Four.


In an instant, a tunnel opened, seemingly to pass through the air itself.


Five.

	<TEXT> Yes, your training as an industrial electriction obviously makes you an expert at singing.

At least in my first post I admitted I can't sing. Never once said I was an expert. All I say is that when you sing a word and you miss the last letter, it sounds off. 

She sings great. I noticed she missed the last letters often. If I notice, odds are others will. But I forget I am dealing with an expert in the field so I humbly step down. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sorry but THIS is not actual advice at all. In fact, it has no point. Listen to a profesional singer and notice they sound out the last letter of words. It was the first thing I noticed with this young singer and it is a very simple fix. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I can't sing worth a damn. You can.

Only advice I could offer is to remember that words have a last letter and it's important to make sure you sing them to. Keep it up, you will do well! </TEXT>
