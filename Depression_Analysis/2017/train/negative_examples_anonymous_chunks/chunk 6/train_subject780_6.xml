	<TEXT> From what I'm reading California has a Points system like we have here ... these are basically demerits that go on your record in addition to the monetary fees.  If they accumulate too high, worse things happen.  Depending on your insurance, they may only look at the points on your record.   

Sometimes even for a simple speeding ticket by appearing in court you can explain the circumstance, that it's your first ticket, etc and perhaps get the points reduced or removed.  It's extremely doubtful you'll get out of the monetary pentalties though. 

Apparently for CA if you just pay the ticket online than you get hit with the points.  As a young drive you're already starting from a ditch in terms of insurance ... I would find and insurance sub and ask if your insurers looks at anything other than points.  If they only look at points, I'd go to court and try to get the points removed at least. 

You definitely don't need a lawyer.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I have a buddy who's never spent the night outdoors and he's working up the courage.  We've agreed to start with car camping, let him ease into it, and then hopefully by fall he'll be backpacking with the rest of us.  I figured I'd take him to any of the nearby State parks; with the showers and potable water on demand plus other activites it seems like a great starter. 

In our State  parks they put you on defined sites that are really gravel pads, about 10 feet away from the next site.  I've only ever car camped on multi-family trips, where we all had sites side by side and even if multiple groups split out playing, hiking whatever there was a group behind to watch over things. 

In this case with just the two of us, if we want to go for a hike think it's ok to leave the gear out, or should we pack it up into the car ?  Or perhaps pack up only stuff that's easy to take (like the stove, cookware, etc) and leave the tent standing ?

	<TEXT> I would call those backpacking tents, where you're really paying for reduced weight and pack size as much as anything else.  If  you're only car camping, and particularly if you're just getting started, you may want to consider a cheaper tent like Eureka.  They'll be roomier, but  bulkier and heavier (as in not recommended necessarily for backpacking) and they'll last forever.   Many of us have 20-30 year old Eurekas that are still holding up fine.   

For waterproofness, the big thing to look at is the fly design; make sure it comes down nice and far and has plenty of lashing points - you want to tension it out away from the main tent walls so they don't touch.   Also consider a footprint or a tarp to go under the main tent floor, particularly if  you'll be in state parks where you may end up setting up on gravel.   If you use a tarp, keep it slightly smaller than the tent's floorprint - you don't want the tarp to stick out past the tent collecting water and funnelling it below you.

Sorry, the intent wasn't to move the entertainment center up there to use it as an entertainment center.  She wants to use it as the  new linen cabinet, placing it in the same space as the linen closet. 

I realize there's painting, drywalling etc involved.  I've done some pretty large scale work in the house (like completely rebuilding the master bath from the joists up) and I'm not afraid of this tiny job.  

I'm really more concerned over whether it's the right move - ripping out a built in feature of the house that seems to work perfectly well only to replace it with an entertainment center.  This could be received as "cool, nice design touch" or as "what the hell, you ripped out your linen closet ? " I'm definitely in the second camp, but don't want to assume anything so was hoping for more opinions on it. thanks !  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hello, we live in a very small 60's house with really very limited storage.   The wife would like to rip out [this linen closet at the top of the stairs] (http://i.imgur.com/BJGilwW.jpg)  and replace it with [this entertainment cabinet] (http://i.imgur.com/XH6D8wG.jpg).  

The Space:  The door to the left  of the linen cabinet is the smallest bedroom which we use as an office.  To the right is a full bathroom.  I'm standing in the hallway that provides access to the other 3 bedrooms to take this photo.  

Do you think this would be a wise decision, or are we best off keeping the linen closet that came with the house ?  Thanks

You likely don't have have tax problems ... while you're making great money for a kid it's not huge in the overall scheme of things and not like you need to worry about AMT or shelters, income from other sources and other complex scenarios.   

Working at home you may qualify for home office deductions perhaps ... go ask about that in a tax sub.  

But the most important thing is to figure out what you should look like financially; debt free, emergency savings, large retirement contributions, savings towards goals, etc.   Make sure you're saving correctly.  Don't be the dude who make great money and puts it all into a BMW. 

And stay single.

	<TEXT> As a shop owner you have a responsibility to keep your store free of nuisance people, but I can understand how as a human you'd want a nice way of going about it.   One idea is to look for local resources in your area, so that when you approach the person you're not just turning them away from your store, but pushing them towards something better. 

If the shop owner doesn't mind hiim coming around, but just doesn't want him harassing customers, than something else you could also consider is telling the person to only come by at closing.  Something to the effect of "look man, we realize you're having a rough go and we'd like to help, but you can't harass the customers.  We know you need a restroom like anyone else, and you like doughnuts ... if you can keep yourself from hitting up the customers you're welcome to come by at closing time, use the latrine and grab a doughnut.  But I'm sure you understand that people don't want to be panhandled while shopping.  We want to help you out, but we can't do that if we have to close our shop because noone wants to shop here anymore.". 

In other words, you can still take the high road while asking him to move along.  Of course, if that doesn't work there are absolutely trespass laws that your police will enforce.  Or just find someone to manup and tell hiim straight "look bro, can't come in anymore, customers been complaining".  May have to do it a couple times a row, but eventually he'll get the message... but someone has to man up to it first.

	<TEXT> We're mulching for like the first time ever.  Have a lot of large tree trunks- anywhere from 1 to 2.5 feet in diameter.  We're putting down that black weed barrier; should we put that over the remaining trunks and mulch over them, or cut around ?  Seems like it might be better to know they're there.  And that we could put potted plants on them or something till they rot out.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> thanks! I try to drink minimum once a day, but if I run or lift I'll drink as recovery as well.  I've been considering laying back off it a bit, but it really does seem to help with growing muscle while losing fat, and with muscle recovery.  The appetite suppresant aspects of protein are a great help too.  I also have a very, very sporadic schedule and may end up missing meals on a regular basis.... try not to let that happen, but it's a reality I have to deal with.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I found that doing alot of ab and core work helped me tighten the belt.  Situps, planks, leg lifts, air biking and other lower body/core/ab stuff ... improved my posture which made my belly stick out less, and pulled my belly up and in. It's not reducing the fat - you can't "spot reduce" fat, but it just holds everything up in place better. 

If I stop the ab and core work, even while increasing running, the belly makes itself known again, even though it's getting smaller. 

Now, combine all that with cardio and better nutrition, and you'll be doing really well. my two cents, downvote as you will. </TEXT>

Yes, a phenomenal location that must be insanely expensive - I've never seen the visitor volume I would imagine necessary to keep them going. I do know they rent it out for corporate events though, and I'm beginning to suspect it's the corporate events that keep them going, not the museum visits itself.

	<TEXT> I feel you... but using  Hotwire and other websites you may be able to say closer in for that money.   Being on the Metro in Shady Grove is a good backup, but honestly man, that area is the most boring suburbs there  is.  Not like upper East side boring, I mean like LI boring.   Not saying doint do it, just realize that once you get back to your hotel each night you'll have nothing to do.  Probably literally won't even be able to walk to a restaurant, so really I would just do everything downtown, and Metro back north when you're ready to pass out. 

Arlington and some of the closer Va suburbs will give you more nightlife, more local dining, and save you a ton of commuting time that you could spend in our great museums instead.  Really, after hoofing around all day you may regret a long commute. Also, don't underestimate the ability of our metro to get packed shoulder to shoulder, break down, etc. It doesn't leak rainwater or smell of urine though;) 

Another commenter found a room in the city for a hundred bucks a night; you can't beat that. 

How experienced are you with digging out cheap hotel rates ? Are you comfortable using stuff like Priceline, Hotwire, etc ?  You realize that going straight to the hotel to book is often the most expensive way right ?   What time frame are you looking at ?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I take a lean isolate protein as a nutritional supplement as well as a recovery.  It was suggested I add dextrose to it for carbs when using as a recovery drink.  My question is ... do I want to add the dextrose to the whole tub, and have the carb/protein mix the whole time, or mix it separately on the side and only use the dextrose-added mix for recovery purposes only ?    I use the lean isolate because fat loss is a goal.   </TEXT>

If it's safe to travel alone in the wilderness (and I understand in many, many countries it isn't) than I'm willing to be there's all sorts of spectacular sites to be seen right in your own country.  If you really want to "backpack  the world" than I would  find a travel sub, and start inquiring about the process to get Visas.  Yes, Visas take time and money to get, but you'll also be spending money on airfare, supplies, transportation, probably even some lodging, so you'll need plenty of dough anyhow. 

I would also seek about blogs by folks who have done multi-country backpacks and learn from them.    </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Correct.  I have mostly leveraged funds and had one issue. The issue dipped below principal and I sold it.  Keep it on a watch list and it continued diving, so I'm glad I got out when I did. That  was chump change for me, like hundreds of dollars.  My real money is in funds that of course ebb and flow like anything else, but have always remained above my principal balance.  I learned to just make sure I wasn't losing money.  NOT losing opportunity cost, but actual  money.  That was a psychological trick that helped me resist the temptation to jump in and out, and I'm glad I took that approach as my multiyear return on them has been great.  </TEXT>
