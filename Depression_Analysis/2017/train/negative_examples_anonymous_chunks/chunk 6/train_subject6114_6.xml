	<TEXT> Using the thing to scroll on the computer while cooking is kind of useless since she stops fixing the salad to do it. Might as well just use the trackpad on the computer at that point... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There seems to be a lot of Hispanic people saying it isn't part of the culture to think someone dying is funny, and it isn't. It also isn't sad though, at least not in Mexican culture. Death is a happy thing, and celebrated on holidays like `Day of the Dead` so maybe it isn't taken to hard in their family. People saying they are assholes seem to be pretty quick to judge, and are telling you what you want to hear. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Trigger IFTTT Recipes </TITLE>

	<TEXT> It currently is very difficult to make a recipe that is complex and robust. Sometimes, it is even harder to link recipes with events that you want to happen because it is a three step process where the middle step is disjoint from the final step. 

I wanted to have a recipe that every day at 12:30 PM grabbed the top post from a subreddit and posted it to the GroupMe. Now, I may be wrong - but I did look around and can't really think of a way to do this. However, if there was a way to make IFTTT recipes a trigger, it would really open up the possibilities for this. It would allow for hugely extensible recipes that could do huge amounts of work for you or even just provide some really cool functionality. Just a thought.

If someone knows how to do what I'm asking I would love to know since right now I'm pretty lost. </TEXT>
