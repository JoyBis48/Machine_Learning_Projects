	<TEXT> You can tell if a shot is a zoom in/out if the background and foreground change at the same rate.  If background is staying the same but the foreground is changing, it is x-axis camera movement.  Only exception is when you combine movement and a zoom, when it is possible to make the foreground stay the same while the background changes. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think that the final psychiatrist scene in Psycho is crucial, because it offers the audience the false hope of fully explaining the plot.  It gives the audience a chance to laugh at themselves and relax, convinced that the whole ordeal was simply an illusion... only to find themselves face to face with the gruesome reality after the psychologist is done.

Using Hitchcock's roller coaster metaphor, the entire movie is a ridiculous roller coaster that leaves the entire audience out of breath.  If you cut out the psychiatrist scene, you cut out the brake run and dump the audience off in the station before they've even got their wits back.  It would be like hitting a brick wall while going sixty miles an hour.  So the psychiatrist scene slowly brings the audience's energy from sixty miles an hour down to a slow crawling speed for a minute, and then gives them one last jerk as the train comes to a stop and we see Norman's face superimposed with the skull/car.

The same rules apply for movies and roller coasters: you want to push the boundaries as far as they can go, but you want to keep people reasonably comfortable in the process.  Unlike roller coasters, movies won't kill audiences if they are designed poorly, but it's important to remember that you never want to leave a bad taste in people's mouths.  While modern directors like to end a movie right when the audience is still on the edge of their seats (Nolan's Inception is a good example), I kind of admire the classic directors who were able to use their filmmaking power to efficiently guide an audience in and out of an intense movie.

Also, Hitchcock considered the psychiatrist scene one of his "icebox scenes".  His theory was that when moviegoers come home, they are inevitably going to grab some snacks from the fridge and talk about the movie for a bit.  This scene gives moviegoers something to talk about, or at least a springboard for understanding the rest of the movie.  It's the old "audiences are stupid" scene that Hitchcock was fond of; it explains the plot of the movie so that viewers can't complain afterwards about the its logic but can just talk about their favorite parts of the story.

If you think this scene really is bad let me know, but for me it's one of my favorite scenes in the movie because of the delicious irony of "modern" psychology attempting to explain what almost seems to border on the supernatural.  My non-film roommate enjoyed the movie and said afterwards, "Isn't it nice that they explain everything for you?"  I had to laugh because the scene hardly explains anything.  Other similar dissonant ending scenes would be the "isn't nature beautiful" helicopter ride at the end of Jurassic Park or the nonchalant "we've got top men working on it" government scene from Raiders of the Lost Ark.  These scenes tie up the pretty little bow of the story all too neatly, making the audience want to watch it again and get to the heart of what the movie was really about. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's true. The first game is still the creepiest for me just because it's harder to keep track of four animatronics than just one.  Also the first game is the only one with doors, which gives you that false sense of security, while the other two games keep you on edge almost constantly and thus have less suspense </TEXT>
