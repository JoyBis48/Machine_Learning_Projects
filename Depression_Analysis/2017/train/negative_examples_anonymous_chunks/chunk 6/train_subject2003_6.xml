Drawing a contrast to the present economic system, how would you go about creating a social balancing system from scratch which would have a chance of being practically efficient over 200 years? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I see where you're going with this. You're saying that the current economic system is still far from fully mature. Hence any attempt to emulate it with a reputation system would be beset by the same imperfections. Hmmm, good points.

Here's where I'm coming from. I'm an investor/analyst working for a billion dollar fund. Basically, I've noticed that broadly speaking, optimal capital allocation is a balance between allocating resources for maximum financial gain and achieving the best social outcome for all stakeholders. I'm not sure what the equivalent is in economics, but that's what it is in investing. However, while it is intuitive to strive for the maximum financial gain on the resource end, typically striving for the maximum social gain is counterproductive to finance. So my conclusion is that there is a lack of accountability for the social side of things in the present economic system (i.e. currency) which fails to take into account the social balance of things, which is why a positive social action is reflected as a negative in a financial context - where optimal capital allocation is represented by something in the middle. If we could create some kind of system of accountability which comprehensively describes both sides of the equation, we might be able to increase productivity by leaps and bounds, as it might reflect in full what financial accountability (i.e. economics) only represents half of. Think of it as what general relativity was to gravity - the former being a more complete representation of reality than the latter to describe reality. You could even win a Nobel prize for it, as this would have immediate and discernible impact on every large company on the planet. 

What are your thoughts? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> you make very good points. We can already see how karma, even without financial incentives, have bred karmawhores who upend the system with reposts. I get what you're saying that the difficult part is tracking down the perverse incentives. Hmm. But perhaps the reputation market will right itself to a significant extent, as the financial market has to at least offer a utilitarian system. Do you have any personal "secret" insights about economics which you wouldn't mind sharing? (for instance, one which might not stand up to peer review) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I understand where you're coming from, but I don't think you have where I am coming from. I'm suggesting a complete change in perspective. You mentioned this:

 How would social value not be arbitrary? You're talking about picking a way that things "should" be and providing an incentive to bring reality more in line with that ideal situation, no? Well, the problem is that people don't agree on that ideal. They're never going to precisely agree.

Well, putting aside the 'how', my suggestion is *to* find a way to make social value not arbitrary. Yes I know it sounds impossible; I'm just putting forth an axiom. *If* we were able to do that, then we could make social goodwill accountable and hence tradable as a form of currency, right? And there would be innumerable good resulting from having such a system. So how do we do that - make social value accountable? 

Again, I realize how impossible it sounds, but my point is to find a way to make social value as accountable as financial value. I was wondering whether someone of your stature might have any ideas, or would be interested in such a discussion. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You'd just be invaded by a coalition of governments and be forced to produce potatoes under torture. 

A more feasible plan would be to build a mercenary army with potatoes as trade. Potatoes are the cheapest form of calories, so controlling the supply would guarantee you a stream of loyal soldiers in poverty territories. Trade potatoes for favors and arms with the most corrupt people on this planet. You could then trade those as currency. Protect yourself by surrounding yourself with your zombie horde (until they decide to drop a nuke on top of you) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes, but if we were able to institute a system which provides proper accountability to social value, then it wouldn't be arbitrary. The problem now is that such accountability doesn't yet exist, hence we turn to financial measures to record them, which obviously doesn't provide adequate incentive. If we could work out an economic system which rewarded social value as much as currency  rewards trade value, I'm sure we coild start working something out. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was thinking more along the lines of creating accountability for social value. Some way or currency we could use to recognize goodwill so that we could store it and reward it a realistic manner. Like you said, recognizing social standing as a currency would incentivize socially positive acts by individuals in society. It would make charitable acts feasibly economical on a large scale where financially it may not. </TEXT>
