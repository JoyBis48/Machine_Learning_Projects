	<TEXT> Damping is basically the more reliable version of ECM. Personally I prefer ECM to dampening, purely because it's more rage inducing. You're right, things like the scorpion do tend to get primaried. I'd suggest going into the tech 2 frigates for small gang (Keres and Hyena are the most favoured) and the Recon for fleet/black ops fights (although even those tend to die fast, as they're not very tanky at all). Something to note too, techinically the Armageddon (Amarr battleship) is an EWAR ship as it gets very good bonus' to neuts. I even think BRAVE might have it as its doctrine.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah i'm relatively new to the game, I don't think i'm in a position to suggest nerfs or buffs. If it was so easy that I could suggest something (or even you, having used them extensively) to 'fix' it then CCP would have done it already.

Granted too most of the bitching i've heard is either from reddit or corp mates, i've never actually flown one. I can see however why they're considered OP. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You should take out those pictures of the GM conversation, pretty sure that's against the rules. Not sure what that GM's on about either. At least from my interpretation Rule 7 just states that you can't *list* items for sale, not that you have to return them if the owner forgets them. The FAQ pretty clearly states you lose those items afterwards. I could be missing something, however, and this is just my uninformed opinion.

Edit: I see how you could interpret that rule to mean that you're not allowed to leave any assets in the character, this does however seem to contradict that FAQ. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You're right, he should, if he has concrete proof on that, which he probably dosen't. Getting someone to verify his identity is really a service to the community, more than anything, so that we know for 99% sure that          the titan kill was wrong, and that anyone trusted at alliance level in CFC is likely to be doxxed illegally. It would be a huge blow to the CFC. </TEXT>
