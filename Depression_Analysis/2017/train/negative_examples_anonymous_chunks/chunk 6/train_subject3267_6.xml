	<TEXT> It was in an actual court of law.  But that doesn't prove Ray's innocence, just that they found him not guilty. He is innocent because he didn't do it. If you take a look at the evidence, it will probably not change your mind, but it may keep you from saying things are are dumb and unfounded. 

If you understood civil court you wouldn't say it was anything like Judge Judy. 

And to this day the King family doesn't believe Ray did it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Exactly. People are so afraid of being alone, that anyone will do. 

It reminds me of what some comedian once said: that marriage for him will probably be like in gym class when the instructor tells everyone to pair up. Everyone shuffles around real quick and finds a partner. He's just standing there looking around. Then before he knows it everyone is paired up, except for some girl on the other side of the gym who, by default, must be his partner.  </TEXT>

I'm going back and forth, and forth, on Williams/Cooper/White.  I tend to end on White or Cooper because we could then better realize Carr's potential.  But then they got Crabtree, so are they thinking this isn't as much of a need.  Then I remember Reg is a former LB, so maybe he prioritizes defense somehow.  

I want Williams *and* either Cooper or White.  Too bad we only get one.  I guess I'd be most happy if Reg saw it my way and got a receiver.  But if he didn't I'd be OK too maybe. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Exactly.  And it explains why anarchists/libertarians have trouble organizing (if we are to see that as "trouble").  Natural freedom entails what appears to be disagreement, but is only difference.  The words keep us apart, because we get fixated on them instead of human-heartedness.  To continue the example of politics:  Democrats and Republicans group themselves in opposition to each other based around artificial concepts, platform planks - pro-this, anti-that - which have nothing to do with real reality.  So they are in perpetual war for their own supposed benefit.  Gay marriage, for instance: Why is any kind of marriage anything more than an agreement between two people, or between two or howevermany whatever?  The powers that be have seized on this artificial issue to the detriment of us all. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hogwash.  Praise be to Almighty Science....er, peer review.  Ignorance of experts on full display here.  Why such zeal and dogma?  Where is your skepticism?  Why make a judgement call?  Why not hold global warming as a provisional possibility?  We haven't even gotten to whether it is caused by man or not.  If it is naturally occurring, apart of man, or not.  Or the question of if it is happening, in this giant universe, why the necessity for alarm as if we humans can do anything good to save ourselves.  All our saving of ourselves has only resulted in more wars, theft, etc.  I think it was a scientist who said if bugs go, life on the planet will have about 50 years, but if humans go, life on the planet will thrive.  So the enlightened are supposed to save us from ourselves?  So the tyrants who spout what they want to to justify taking our money for their own benefit are going to save us???  Get real.  

So at least you admit that consensus can be wrong.  You don't hear that from the rest though.  And even you say that if you have a "convergence of data", it is very unlikely to be wrong.  Oh the chances are slim.  I see.  Again you drift into non-science really fast.  If you guys are all talking about likelihood, then say so.  If this is a Pascal's wager thing, say so.  But none of you do.  You say it is happening, and anyone can see it, even though no one can see the data or interpret it properly, etc.  This is how you don't do your cause any service.  But you are the enlightened one, adored by academics and the tyrants.  Make a fucking prediction.  What's the temperature going to be in 10 years?  Al Gore should be able to put $1,000,000 on it.  I'm sure someone would take his bet.  But you can't even tell me the temperature next week.  But that's probably because I'm not a scientist.  

All the great scientists had skepticism and doubt and uncertainty, and were certain of their own ignorance, perceptions, etc.  They even doubted the fucking data.  NONE of the climate change zealots EVER express this.  They are religious extremists.

EDIT:  Nothing personal.  I don't want to be this harsh.  Forgive me.

	<TEXT> Here are the [reading lists](http://www.sjc.edu/academic-programs/graduate/master-s-liberal-arts/reading-lists/).

Henry Hazlitt - [Economics in One Lesson](https://mises.org/library/economics-one-lesson)

Irwin Schiff - [How an Economy Grows and Why It Doesn't](http://freedom-school.com/money/how-an-economy-grows.pdf)

[Fredric Bastiat collection](https://mises.org/sites/default/files/The%20Bastiat%20Collection_4.pdf)
Including "The Law", which you should read too.

Murrary Rothbard - [What Has Government Done to Our Money?](https://mises.org/library/what-has-government-done-our-money) Maybe read this first.  Incredible book.

Ludwig von Mises - [Human Action](https://mises.org/sites/default/files/Human%20Action_3.pdf)  The first books are short.  This one is long.

I don't know any good nutrition books.  Just wish I had learned it. 

Regarding philosophy:  I would start with the existentialists, and among them Soren Kierkegaard.  Because he was such an incredible philosopher, but also because his philosophy, and that of the rest of the existentialists, is so human.  It is not abstract, is not about concepts exclusively.  It will engage you and bring you in.  A lot of philosophy is difficult when initially confronted by a novice - but not always.  Also read the philosophy on the St. John's list.  Those are the basics.  Perhaps Plato and Aristotle most basic.

[Lao Tzu](http://www.amazon.com/Tao-Te-Ching-Lao-Tzu/dp/014044131X) (Tao Te Ching) and [Chuang Tzu](http://www.amazon.com/The-Book-Chuang-Penguin-Classics/dp/014045537X) are the 2 basic Taoist texts.  Dating from 600-400 BC.  They are poetic and beyond words, literally and figuratively.  It would also provide a basis for other philosophy reading, though Taoism is not per se a philosophy or a religion.  Plus, it is eastern so it has a different angle.  Many parallels between Taoism and existentialism.  But read these alongside Alan Watts' ["Tao: The Watercourse Way"](http://www.amazon.com/Tao-The-Watercourse-Alan-Watts/dp/0394733118).  It might blow your mind.  Excellent stuff.  And not esoteric at all.

	<TEXT> You need some training in basic epistemology.  It isn't a "hard science", but give it a try.  

The point with Galileo, which you probably get anyway, is that the *established consensus was wrong!*.  In your world, the "consensus" can't be wrong, and ignorance doesn't exist.  Let alone the questions of what a consensus is, who establishes it, etc.  You try to dismiss my example and say that they weren't scientists, that Galileo was the "first scientist".  What unscientific, purely rhetorical, nonsense!  "Considered by many" ?????  You and your ilk can keep parroting this considered-by-many delusion as fact in some way, but not only is it meaningless, it is misleading and *unscientific*.  

You argue against yourself when you say that no one but Galileo was a scientist in his time, so all the naysayers get a pass.  But nowadays you heap scorn on all the non-scientists if they don't take on faith what is supposedly established as consensus, though not 100% of course.  Because how are they supposed to process all that data and evidence, if it is so difficult for real scientists to do it?  Oh, by faith.  I see.  Now it's a religion.  Consensus becomes herd mentality.  Science is determined in the comments on reddit.  If I agree with you I understand how science works.  If I don't, I don't.  I'm afraid you don't understand how science works.  

If global warming is happening, you aren't making any good fucking argument for it.  You're making a pathetic, unintentionally unscientific argument not to listen to a goddamn word you say.  

One simple question for you:  Can the consensus be wrong? 

EDIT:  By the way, what's the consensus now?  Is it 90% or 95%?  Unlike with temperatures, the exact number is hard to determine.  Maybe we should just find out what the consensus on the consensus is. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sure most people would say SK is anti-Hegel.  And we would know what they mean. In some circles, where people fear being seen as too simple, perhaps they would elaborate. Usually not here on reddit though. 

Like with a lot of philosophy there are layers and there are indirect influences.  And there are contrarian books out there for everything. 

But to say SK was not anti-Hegel is the point that is untrue on its face, and only might be partially true with serious explanation, none that could be derived from what SK himself said, however.  </TEXT>

You, in your zeal and righteous indignation, try to come down on me for a quote made by someone else. Something deep inside you must have been triggered. It is this kind of reflexive animal religiousity that is a threat to rationality and real science. And, like any religion, entails massive hypocrisy and denial.  </TEXT>

I think Woody Allen addresses existentialism in most of his movies. A lot of the humor comes from the absurdity of life. Also, 'One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest' is very Taoist-existentialist. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> **Keys to the Game**

The Spurs defense is messing with our flow.  They are picking CP3 up at just across half court.  CP3 has to work to get around it just to the 3 point line to get the offense going, get a pass off, dribble anywhere.  And they give him different looks with Green and Leonard switching it up. It takes precious time off the shot clock if nothing else.  Hence, we haven't been rotating, cutting, moving, creating opportunities like usual.  When CP3 moves and passes, we are much better.  This should be obvious.

Blake can't be defended by any single Spur.  He needs to just dribble down to the post and shoot a bunny every time, or turn around and make a move.  He will either make a shot, get fouled, or pass to someone else open if he gets doubled.  But last night he didn't do this.  Heck, Splitter is playing him like a little bug.  

Barnes needs to cover Leonard like a blanket.  Don't help anyone else out.  Stay less than one arm's length from Leonard *at all times*.  Don't let him *receive* a pass.  Don't let him touch the ball.  It can be done.

Reddick and/or Barnes and/or Crawford need to be on.  When these guys all have an off night, or even 2 of them have an off night, we struggle big time.  

In the off-season we need to acquire a serious bench.  Hedo, Big Baby, and Spencer Hawes can barely even run.  They seriously look like they are in some geriatric condition, hobbling around everywhere.  And Baby shoots the most blockable shot in the world.  Hedo - at least he does no harm.  Remember when we had Eric Bledsoe, Caron Butler, Lamar Odom....? </TEXT>

It tells what the sage would do or not do.  Most of it comes down to wisdom and seeking harmony, not coercion, not impatience.

	<TEXT> If there are good cops out there, why dont they speak out against their murdurous colleagues? All - yes, all - police unions are corrupt. We have an epidemic of police abuse and cover up. Check out r/bad_cop_no_donut and see for yourself.  People getting KILLED everyday for doing nothing. Then the DA's dont prosecute. And we have the prisons full and overflowing with non-violent offenders. The US justice system is fucked up.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> there is something in ch. 2 of Chuang Tzu. about not wasting one's energy with others who dont get it because they wont get it. it is referring to leaders and authorities, but still applies. there are probably other references too. 

i try to tell myself to let the substance of what i am saying speak for itself and not be wedded or identified with what i am saying. if i say it, that i will be ok with however it is received, knowing that its reception isnt up to me at all, but only to say it. people are really up against reality and not against me. i try to present it as impersonally as possible. not to say that this is always how i do it though.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ive been there. One thing I had to realize is that existence doesnt mean stasis. Things grow and change and learn. 

I would highly recommend checking out Taoism. Discovering it has done wonders for me. The two primary texts are The Tao Te Ching and The Book of Chuang Tzu. But also get The Watercourse Way by Alam Watts as a primer. Taoism shares much with existentialism, but not everything. It is not a religion or philosophy. Essentially, it is the way of nature. Becoming aware of it has helped me realize my place in the world, and helped rid me of existential angst, etc. Anyway, I cant do it justice here, but very strongly recommend it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> thanks, to say the least. 

im leaning toward cooper or white because they would make carr better able to reach his potential. by getting a WR we tap into that synergy they would have with carr. it is a synergy that would otherwise remain underutilized, if carr doesnt have a WR weapon. though we did just get crabtree, i think the point still stands. looking forward to see what reggie does. we have a lot of good options.  </TEXT>
