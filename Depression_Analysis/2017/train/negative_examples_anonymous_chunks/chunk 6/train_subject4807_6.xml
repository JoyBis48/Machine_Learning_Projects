	<TEXT>  I read everything else below and think you are getting an unreasonable amount of shit for your post.

Thanks for your reply. I never meant to be rude but I was careless in my phrasing. I'm glad and proud that Columbus finally passed this law -- that's what I was trying to convey, but the way I said it completely undercut the intent.

You should also know that this sub has a reputation for being so brutal that it once was near the top of the list in a discussion of most toxic local reddits, and that in particular that I have a small posse of haters who downvote and disparage almost anything I say. That doesn't account for all the critical comments-- some were right on target about how unwelcoming my original comment was -- but a couple of those people hate me so much they'll come into a thread on /r/aww to snarl at me. So it's not all about this discussion.

Anyway, I hope you find what you're seeking here, and add that the weekly "Bar Thursday" gatherings listed in /r/ColumbusSocial are reportedly very friendly. I won't be there, because I don't feel welcome. </TEXT>

I don't know how close a relative this is, but you might want to consider the likelihood that what's happening with the dog now is a preview of what will happen with the human eventually. The ties you make or break within the family now may be even more important later...

I'm now convinced of your sincere concern for the dog, and wish for you all the best outcome, whatever that is.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not really. I know a lot about Suprynowicz. The Drega killings happened in New Hampshire. But you did detect something there: the reason I paid extra attention to Dennis Joos and the Drega rampage when others were looking at Diana's death is that I was a journalist, too.

BTW, there's a new book about this coming out this summer from Beacon Press that may finally correct the public record about Drega. I've talked to the author, and it looks like it will be an excellent read. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The Review-Journal is unfortunately Nevada's largest newspaper, but the more reputable choice is the Las Vegas Sun.

What would be excellent is if you could never let anybody forget the Colebrook story, and Suprynowicz's role in its aftermath. The attacks happened before most people understood the danger of lone wolves motivated by Sovereign Citizen crackpottery, so a lot of people wrote it off as a singular event with no political significance. (It was also the week Princess Diana was killed, and that ate the newshole almost everywhere outside the affected local area.) But Supryowicz took this horror, turned it upside down and spent years touring the backwaters of the US using his book to mobilize anti-government RW crazies. 

More people should know about the reflexive heroism of another newspaper editor, Dennis Joos, who threw himself on Drega when he attacked the newspaper office. Joos was killed trying to save his staff and friends. The local library is now named for him.

All of which is by way of saying, too late, that deleting this post might not have been the best choice -- although I understand the logic. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If the pet is still eating, it's not time yet. When the pet stops eating and *won't* move (as opposed to having difficulty), that's the end. Until then it's at the discretion of the owner, for better or worse. It's not animal cruelty to be unable to say goodbye to a beloved friend, and your eagerness to report what should be solved within the family undercuts your asserted compassion. 

You might want to explain to your family member that many pets stay alive for their owners' sakes, and that past a certain point that's not really fair to the animal.

Finally, if the owner once allowed someone else to take the pet to the vet, would s/he allow a third professional assessment now? </TEXT>

The new law applies only to enclosed areas. As that term is defined, however, it includes more than just indoor spaces. Decks or patios that are covered overheadby a roof or even umbrellas or awningsand on more than two sides are also enclosed under the law. Smoking is not allowed if members of the public are invited or allowed into these areas, or if anyone works there as an employee, an independent contractor, or even as a volunteer. Business owners still have the option of making their entire facilities non smoking, both indoors and out.

They can even help you [find out who in your area is working with feral cats](http://www.alleycat.org/FeralFriends), which may lead you to the individual who is feeding them. (Because this is dubiously legal in some municipalities, they may be working at night.)

You could also try posting in your local and state reddit communities to ask how to contact local feral cat caretakers.

One thing you can do immediately is make sure they have access to clean water. Sometimes feral cats are fed, but not given water -- and that's a big deal.

	<TEXT> Yeah, that's part of the problem. There are union democracy movements particular to many national unions, but most don't have a high enough profile to reach down to the local rank and file unless there happens to be a member who has wide general knowledge of and interest in unionism in general. Some such groups, like Teamsters for a Democratic Union (TDU) have been so well-established for so long that they have actually wrought major changes. I'd suggest that anyone who is a union member should go looking for their union's rank and file oppositionists, because there usually is help to be found. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  That is their job. they have to defend every single worker.

No it isn't, and no they don't. Not all complaints are legitimate greivances; the job of the union steward is to sort them out and decide whether/when to file a grievance.

The biggest problem workers have with unions is foot-dragging on filing and aggressively pursuing grievances. The most annoying problem for unions is members who don't bother to read the damn contract and thus either don't bother to seek redress or do so for ridiculous complaints.

	<TEXT> [Progressive Democrats of America](http://www.pdamerica.org/about-us/history) is essentially the faction within the Democratic Party that doesn't want Clinton to be the nominee. They are not the problem. 

Many PACs serve a legitimate purpose and do good work. Super PACs, which don't have to disclose who their donations come from, are the biggest part of the problem. The "Ready for Bernie"/"Bet on Bernie" PAC is another sort of problem: they disclose, but although they claim to be supporting Sanders, there's no way to tell whether the uses they put donations to are helpful to his campaign.

I say "they" when referring to this PAC (which is a hybrid form, but not a Super PAC), but right now [there's no reason to think it's more than one person, with unclear motive.](http://np.reddit.com/r/SandersForPresident/comments/37xffz/this_website_claims_to_be_a_bernie_sanders_super/crql9z6)

No, it's just a ["political entrepreneur"](http://www.reddit.com/r/SandersForPresident/comments/37xffz/this_website_claims_to_be_a_bernie_sanders_super/crqlleo) who serially uses whatever issue he can raise money around to bolster his resume and, not so incidentally, pay himself as Treasurer.

It will be exactly as much of a problem as Sanders' supporters let it become. The way to avert that is to educate ourselves and teach others how this system works and why they should only contribute to the official campaign. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There is, but it's not what you think. 

The PAC is real, and apparently registered with the Federal Elections Commission. That doesn't mean its existence has the approval of the Sanders campaign. 

This PAC, which is in no way connected to the Sanders campaign, is the project of a middle aged lobbyist named [Carey L. Peterson](https://sites.google.com/site/caryleepetersonprofilearticle/). 

From a quick survey of this lobbyists' history and other projects, he appears to be a political entrepreneur -- he's in it for the money. I don't see anything that suggests he's a true believer, and sending money to this PAC is not a good idea.

EDIT: [**Here's an article from Bernie's hometown paper that explains this PAC.**](http://www.burlingtonfreepress.com/story/news/politics/2015/05/30/sanders-unable-superpacs/28184005/)

Yes, and how that happened deserves a lot more attention.

OP, while you're doing background research, be sure to look into the movement that *preceded* second-wave feminism: Women's Liberation. Based in an internationalist, class-based analysis, this is a perspective that simply could not ever be warped into the grotesque caricature that academics made of feminism. And the women who considered themselves part of a global women's liberation movement were the ones who shook the world in the late 60s/early 70s. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> ...  a reporter is considering doing a brief news story that might negatively portray one of the sponsor companies and the company prefers they minimize coverage...

I don't know how much of a problem media corruption is...

The kind of corruption you cite is infinitely less common than you imagine. The vast majority of reporters and editors in serious news organizations are honest. The problems you see are primarily due to the model of journalism being practiced: a blind belief in "objectivity through balance" combined with a skewed agenda favoring what readers want to consume rather than what they need to know, all dialed up to 11 by the concentration of ownership that happened over the past twenty years. Investigative teams all over the country were disbanded and defunded as marketing experts convinced the new beancounters to chase reader/viewer eyeballs with increasingly salacious clickbait.

This isn't something that's going to be fixed anytime soon -- especially not by non-journalists after the main players have spent two decades trying to figure it out.  So focusing on this instead of on-the-ground organizing would be a serious mistake.

	<TEXT> I thought this was an interesting intellectual debate -- until I learned more about the "poet" in question. As a *real* poet informed me after I stupidly Tweeted this story without researching further,

Place is a white conceptual artist and lawyer who has published the documents (all of them) from a criminal case and called it poetry. She wrote in Joel Chandler Harris dialect, and her appropriation of this has been the subject of extensive debate. She says, "Authorship doesn't matter. Content doesn't master. Form doesn't master. Meter doesn't matter. All that matters is the trace of poetry."

So the answer is, no, tweeting GWTW doesn't make this poet racist. That ship sailed long ago: she was a consolidated, intentionally provocative racist long before this project.

EDIT: ...and damn the Daily Beast for omitting that critical context.

I just have a fixation about this because PP is the result of the abandonment of investigative journalism teams at major newspapers in favor of outsourcing to free-standing groups dependent on foundations for funding. It's a terrible model, and the transition cost a lot of very good reporters their livelihoods. So I want PP to succeed with its mixed-funding model, and right now it still needs to demonstrate support by showing public support via clickthroughs and shares.

You did more good than harm by posting any version at all of this very important story. I was speaking mostly to other readers, not you, and I thank you for taking this seeming criticism so well. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If that's true, the mods need to reconsider. Buzzfeed is gearing up and becoming a serious news org. It recently got a seat in the WH briefing room, ahead of reporters from better-known news orgs, and that happened because of their new commitment to serious political reporting. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's everywhere on reddit right now. It would take a lot of swatting, even with the best possible answer, to deal with all of it. I suggest ignoring the venues that will always be hostile to Sanders, and focus on dealing with it in general discussion forums.

And, frankly, this WILL make it to the venue that still determines how a lot of people vote: your local daily newspaper. You may not usually read it, but during the next 18 months, it's a must-read and an important place to speak up, through letters to the editor. </TEXT>
