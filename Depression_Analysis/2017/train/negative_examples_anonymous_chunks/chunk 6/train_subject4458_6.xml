	<TEXT> I'm liking the new interface and all but Nintendo really needs to step up when it comes to naming their products. I bet there's going to be a good amount of disappointed children getting the regular 3ds model because of uninformed parents.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The only complaint that I would have to make with this.  
[Spoiler](#s "Bigby mentions in his first meeting with Faith(which was before meeting Nerissa) was that he feels like she had a sense of familiarity to her.  Maybe the realization might be what you said but what irks me still is what was the connection of his initial familiarity with Faith")  
Correct me if I got anything wrong. </TEXT>
