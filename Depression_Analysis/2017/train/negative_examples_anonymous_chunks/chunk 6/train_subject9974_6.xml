I support the abolishment of the Federal reserve, welfare state, the IRS, ending the drug war, opening the borders, and introducong a flat tax. The dems don't support decentralization. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thats because most of us young Republicans are actually old school republicans (as in pre-prohibition Republicans).

The new identity of conservatives is remarkably unconservative. The whole point of conservatism is less government involvement. State regulation of marriage, the drig war, an aggressive foreign policy, strict border control; none of these things are truly conservative at all. There is a new wave of liberty loving Republicans though. </TEXT>

2. Gardening - I love trying to be more self sufficient, and enjoy working with my hands. 

3. Fishing -Nothing more relaxing than a day on the river/lake with a cold sixpack and a few sandwiches.

4. Hunting - Again, I love being self sufficient. I love the thrill of taking down game, I love preparing fresh game. 

5. Camping - I like being out in nature, retreating from the modern world. I am not a big technology buff, and like the simplicity of being alone in the woods.

I don't really watch tv or play videogames. I do enjoy interacting with people via the internet, but otherwise I am a pretty unplugged guy. I like nature, working with my hands, and doing things for myself. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Monopolization is extremely rare in the free market without big businesses using force. Since we (Right Libertarians) oppose all acts of aggression that would be nullified. Monopolies are usually created by the government through corporation friendly legislation. There is no evidence for a natural monopoly occuring in the free market. If you are so adamantly against monopolies, why do you support the government's monopoly of force?


The government did "technically" invent the internet. But in keeping with my previous statement, it did so shittily. It created Aparnet, a network which only communicated between 37 computers. Only when the internet was privatized in 1995 did it flourish and become usable for the average person. Even while the government was "inventing the internet" it was done through private sector research. Why didm't the free market create the internet on their own? Because the government heavily regulated the research though the FCC and blocked out private sector attempts.

I am originally from Baldwin County, but I have been in the Army for the past few years. I am nearing my transition date and preparing to move to Birmingham to attend UAB. I had some questions about the city.

1. What is the city vibe like? I enjoy artsy stuff, indie bookstores, theatre, live music, etc. 

2. What is the job market like? I will be looking for a blue collar job while I attend school. I have experience in logistics, plan on looking for work with either the railroad, UPS, FEDEX, manufacturing, or anything else I can do to support my family. I am really open to anything with decent pay. 

3. Anything else you wanna tell me about Bham? get me excited to move there? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Actually, I do have the same attitude about focusing on Democrats namecalling. As a Libertarian-Republican I agree with Democrats on a good many issues, and don't buy into the two party hostilities. I have no respect or support for establishment politicians at all regardless of their party. I think Giuliani's comments were pointless, but just about everything he says is. I just think it is a waste of time to cover this as actual news, other than a passing reference. </TEXT>

A crypto safe always has a list of specific people who are allowed access to it, so that would be the standard the guard will follow.


To answer youe larger question, an order can be disobeyed if it violates human rights, or basic military values. Basically if an officer tells me to do something morally wrong like rape or shoot a baby, I can and will refuse it. On murkier issues if you refuse an order, you will have to present a case before court marshall and they will judge whether it was moral or not. </TEXT>

One guy says someone else "doesn't love America" and we have to discuss it for an hour and a half, with panels of experts commenting on the implications of such comments on the GOP's 2016 race? 

Why does this remind me of an analysis of an argument between toddlers?
