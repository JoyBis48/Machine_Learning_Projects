	<TEXT> My bus journey to work was 1 hour so I always had the best naps before and after work. I remember waking up one time with dribble hanging out my mouth and a big wet patch on my t-shirt and the old lady next to me just staring like I was the filthiest pig she'd ever seen. 

Also I jerked awake and kick the chair in front and cut my shin.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I used to work in a busy store and once overheard some coworkers saying that they hate it when I fart next to them when they're with a customer and walk away. 

Also my friends' impression of me involves a lot of pointing but I had no clue that I did that.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This song was the hold music when I was on the phone yesterday. Sang by a female, it had a 90's feel to it, like TLC or something. It sounded like a black girl, all up and down. 

Google doesn't return anything with those lyrics apart from Macy Gray and some rap songs. It's driving me crazy. 

Please help me! </TEXT>
