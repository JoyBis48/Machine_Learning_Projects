	<TEXT> I enjoy PC gaming and spent over $2,000 for my gaming desktop. I sold my desktop because I rarely use it. I like the fact that all my required work is on my MacBook Pro for work. I would 100% be one of the people purchasing an external graphics card solution so I could just switch to Windows and game and switch back for work.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Is there a forum or place to join a keeper league. I have a league with some friends but my last three years but I've wanted to do a keeper league similar to franchise building with a large amount of keepers for position players. 

I would prefer head-to-head total points but that's not really a must for me. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Do I have to 'Ask for a response' before I can submit an offer? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-01-14 23:20:05 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Submit an offer is greyed out until I make an agreement with the player. I accidentally put my game on vacation mode at the very beginning and the CPU signed many players for much less then what they demanded. 

It's annoying because if I ask for a response and it's low they raise the demanding price. Just out of curiosity I kept asking for a response and a player demanding 2 million got up to 12 million dollars. I simmed ahead 2 weeks and tried to resign him and he was still asking for 12 million even though he was only demanding 2.

Thank you

	<TITLE> When most comments receive gold, people typically edit their post with an additional remark. So giving gold is equivalent to asking the person posting for an encore. </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Very frustrating but I ended up pulling up OOTP on finder and was able to delete it from there. I went back to the App Store and redownloaded the game. Surprisingly (or maybe not if you're more advanced in Mac's/Safe Files/etc) my saved games were still present. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> First off I know this is my fault. I know I'm an idiot, and I know I'm not worthy. Ok now that I have made my peace this is what I did last night. 

I own OOTP, purchased VIA APP STORE on my macbook pro. I downloaded patch #6 from the official forums. I did not read the disclaimer not to do this. I downloaded and added to my apps. Now I can't delete the game from my apps list and it thinks I'm using a demo version of the game. Please help </TEXT>
