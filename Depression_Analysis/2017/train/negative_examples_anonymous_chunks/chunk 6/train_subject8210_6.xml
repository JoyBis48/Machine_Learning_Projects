	<TEXT> Still don't see the importance though, I'm not quoting the source.

Because it gives fuller context to the quote, as well as highlights what site is reporting on the article so you can immediately notate the likelihood of bias. Additionally, merely because people may have said something, does not mean they witnessed it firsthand. They may be repeating something that an unknown person told them or have heard about elsewhere potentially making the information circular anyway and ultimately all from one source.

Quotes like these are easily verified.

Then verify it.  Show me links.

You want to dismiss them without consideration, fine.

I'm asking you to support your posts.  Apparently, you are unable to do that.  Speaks volumes about the credibility of either the quote or the source you used.

Since you're supposedly so adept at looking things up on Google, maybe you should do the same with this.

That stuff is all bits I've saved in my tinfoil, conspiracy nut folder.

[Seriously?](http://i.giphy.com/i4OfVOFke0jxm.gif)  You save quotes on your phone about this?

Why's a link so important,

Because it gives fuller context to the quote, as well as highlights what site is reporting on the article so you can immediately notate the likelihood of bias.  Additionally, merely because people may have said something, does not mean they witnessed it firsthand.  They may be repeating something that an unknown person told them or have heard about elsewhere potentially making the information circular anyway and ultimately all from one source.

just copy and paste 

You mean like what you should do with the links for the quotes you provided?

and look it up

We've been through this before.  You provided the quote, you provide the source.  Not my job to support your case.

 it's pretty easy to trace this shit to its source. 

Then it should be pretty easy for you to provide the links to the sources you provided.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> credible

Here's the thing.  How do you know they are truly credible?  Because someone threw it up on the internet and said they were?  What you did is you searched "credible" and looked for things that supported your already held ideas.  Ever seen [this](http://www.challengefuture.org/static/upload/uploads/abe-lincoln.jpg)?  There is a reason that was made.  Because too many people believe what they find on the internet to be true just because it's on the internet.

sorry if I've been rude with you, but I find it extremely insulting to be called nuts for exercising basic logic.

I don't recall calling you "nuts" but when someone wants to be a jackass and make statements like:

And that sir, is the marvelous way in which the masses give themself permission to exercise zero logic rather than consider a potentially uncomfortable truth. Go back to sleep America.
 
and

Gomer, what, now you can't fucking read either?

and 

I gave you the name, find it yourself you lazy cunt.

You can then take your "I'm insulted" and shove it up your ass sideways.  Hell, you already said once you were done with this topic but you still came back.  Why?  I guess you lie and are thus not a credible person.  [Take care.](http://gph.is/14hiivF)

This is a line of crap right here and an example of the attitude as to why laws won't change, because people accept defeat without even trying.  If you want laws to change, it can be done but time, work, and effort need to be put into it.  Hell, look at where things are moving with cannabis.  Change can happen.

What if the crimes are victimless and the laws are unjust? 

Prove to a solid majority of people in your area with unbiased information that supports your point that the crimes are victimless or laws unjust.  Simply saying it doesn't make it so.  It just sounds like one person stating an opinion.

Like selling cannabis or sex? 

I personally believe, and this is only my opinion, that there are more crimes and "victims" with these two items being illegal in most places.  The only reason I can figure why they haven't been legalized is because the people in office haven't yet figured out how to make more money off of them with them being legal yet. </TEXT>

Two studies published in 2013 and 2014 have found that people who are identified as trolls tend to have dark personality traits and show signs of sadism, antisocial behavior, psychopathy, and machiavellianism. The 2013 study suggested that there are a number of similarities between anti-social and flame trolling activities and the 2014 study suggested that the noxious personality characteristics known as the "dark triad of personality" should be investigated in the analysis of trolling, and concluded that trolling appears "to be an Internet manifestation of everyday sadism." Their relevance is suggested by research linking these traits to bullying in both adolescents and adults. The 2014 study found that trolls operate as agents of chaos on the Internet, exploiting hot-button issues to make users appear overly emotional or foolish in some manner. If an unfortunate person falls into their trap, trolling intensies for further, merciless amusement. This is why novice Internet users are routinely admonished, "Do not feed the trolls!" The 2013 study found that trolls often have a high expectation of what it means to be successful, which is higher than they are able to attain, and this results in them resenting others who think they are successful but who fall below their standards. </TEXT>

In 1791, partly as a result of the Copper Panic of 1789, Congress imposed an excise tax on distilled spirits, which led to protests in frontier districts, especially Pennsylvania. By 1794, after Washington ordered the protesters to appear in U.S. district court, the protests turned into full-scale defiance of federal authority known as the Whiskey Rebellion. The federal army was too small to be used, so Washington invoked the Militia Act of 1792 to summon militias from Pennsylvania, Virginia, Maryland and New Jersey. The governors sent the troops with Washington taking initial command. He then subsequently named Henry "Lighthorse Harry" Lee as field commander of the troops being marched into the rebellious districts. The rebels dispersed and there was no fighting, as Washington's forceful action proved the new government could protect itself. These events marked the first time under the new constitution that the federal government used strong military force to exert authority over the states and citizens and is also the only time a sitting U.S. president personally commanded troops in the field. </TEXT>

And one more question, do you enjoy looking at all of the other racy subs? Did these ones just strike a nerve with you?

You very clearly don't understand why these specific subreddits were removed.  Instead of following the mob mentality, go out and educate yourself as to why it was actually done. </TEXT>

I really don't get the uproar.  This site is free to use, as is imgur and others of the like.  Reddit has no obligation to allow you to do whatever the hell you want.  If you were paying them to use their services I could see an argument but as it stands, you're not.

Raccoons can carry rabies, a lethal disease caused by the neurotropic rabies virus carried in the saliva and transmitted by bites. Its spread began in Florida and Georgia in the 1950s and was facilitated by the introduction of infected individuals to Virginia and North Dakota in the late 1970s. Of the 6,940 documented rabies cases reported in the United States in 2006, 2,615 (37.7%) were in raccoons. The U.S. Department of Agriculture, as well as local authorities in several U.S. states and Canadian provinces, has developed oral vaccination programs to fight the spread of the disease in endangered populations. Only one human fatality has been reported after transmission of the rabies virus strain commonly known as "raccoon rabies". Among the main symptoms for rabies in raccoons are a generally sickly appearance, impaired mobility, abnormal vocalization, and aggressiveness. There may be no visible signs at all, however, and most individuals do not show the aggressive behavior seen in infected canids; rabid raccoons will often retire to their dens instead. Organizations like the U.S. Forest Service encourage people to stay away from animals with unusual behavior or appearance, and to notify the proper authorities, such as an animal control officer from the local health department. Since healthy animals, especially nursing mothers, will occasionally forage during the day, daylight activity is not a reliable indicator of illness in raccoons. </TEXT>

In 1840, Lincoln became engaged to Mary Todd, who was from a wealthy slave-holding family in Lexington, Kentucky. They met in Springfield, Illinois, in December 1839 and were engaged the following December. A wedding set for January 1, 1841, was canceled when the two broke off their engagement at Lincoln's initiative. They later met again at a party and married on November 4, 1842, in the Springfield mansion of Mary's married sister. While preparing for the nuptials and feeling anxiety again, Lincoln, when asked where he was going, replied, "To hell, I suppose." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> read the news report dude

I did, three times now.

Some lady neighbour came over, shouted racial slurs at the black kids, and slugged a teenage girl in the face

And it didn't say this at all.  So, again, source?

The first video starts when she's pulling hair with the girl. 

Ah, so it **STARTS** during the fight?  And doesn't show what actually happened prior to the recording starting?

Every person said the lady started it. 

Surely you have a source for *every* person stating this.

The "statement I can't back up" is the word of every fucking person there.

*Every*?  Surely you have a source to support what *every* person there said?

I'm not doing your homework just try reading a paragraph or two from a news report or two.

Ah yes, the good old reddit rebuttal of "Damn, I can't support my own claims with cited source so I'll put the onus on the person asking me to back up my words."   </TEXT>

Source?

there's actually video evidence that it was a neighbourhood lady coming over to fight with the kids

First, where is the video for this?  Secondly, what were the actions going on before the video started?

but I don't think her racial slurs were caught on camera

So a statement that you can't back up? </TEXT>

So, this opening sentence to the article, combined with the title of the article (also the title of this post), leads me to ask:

What is the abortion rate doing-in regards to those that are now being done "off the record"-in the states that make abortions more difficult to get?  Yes, this is impossible to know but something to consider anyway.

Does anybody ever actually bother to wonder what people were doing that caused the police to be there in the first place?

Title and in the article are 2 different things, **It seems like he was charged for the drugs and the launcher** google mcgruff arrested none say guns. 

Yet the title doesn't say he was arrested for any of that.  Hell, the word "arrest" isn't even in the title.

Click bait is making something seem worse then it is.

Well, the title is exactly what it is.  He was sentenced to 16 years.  Prior to that, authorities searched his house and found that stuff.  Is it wrong?

OK smart guy I am sick of looking, please provide me with a list of all 27 weapons found my google skills are not finding them

Not my job.  I posted the article that supports the TIL.  If you'd like to learn more, do your own research.  Get to it champ.
