	<TEXT> Regardless of what happened. When someone pulls a gun on you and does not seem to be an imminent threat, you DO NOT argue with them no matter how wrong you think they are. Someone pulling a gun like that in a situation like this probably isn't too stable, and the best thing to do is to move along and call the police. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Just about anybody that improves their diet, sleep and health habits will likely see both physical and mental improvements. 

This study seems a bit odd. Reported results were subjective, and there is nothing substantiating that the patients were not still at a major cognitive deficit. It seems to me it is less about 'reversing' Alzheimer's losses and more about reducing the number of other factors that lead to cognitive impairment (like stress, sleep deprivation, malnutrition, etc etc).

	<TEXT> I have a neuromuscular disorder that causes severe pain and this is the way things are for me. I'm still quite young, but I don't feel things like I should because the background pain masks it. Somehow I recently got a gigantic bruise/abrasion on my leg that covered my whole thigh, but I have no idea when or how it happened because the pain never broke through the existing pain. It sucks. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There is a certain type of bot that is 100% indistinguishable from a human user when using Reddit. They cannot be feasibly detected outside of requiring non-software-trivial manual intervention (like captchas) on the part of the users of Reddit. Even then the captchas can be farmed out to real users for solving.

It's Reddit's Achilles heel. Such bots could network together or use embedded upvote/downvote logic to wreak havoc on Reddit. The "solution" would likely involve invasive captcha style validations paired with two factor authentication, but as a solution it also ruins Reddit simplicity in other ways. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Lakes like this can be so freaky and misleading when it comes to depth. I remember going to a clear alpine lake like this when I was a kid. Being a kid I had a little toy boat and had it attached to kite string so I could put it on the water and have it blow out towards the middle of the lake.

It only sank once, and it wasn't very far from the shore, out where I expected I could wade out and get it. But as I watched the crystal clear waters it kept sinking, and sinking... and sinking.  I watched it sink probably 15 feet all the way to the bottom. From the shore it looked like the water would only be a few feet deep. Nope nope nope nope. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Localized in the sense that it was not an organized group perpetrating the attack.
 
The Canadian attack was considered terrorism related because it was an attack against the government, and the ideology behind it was driven by a call from ISIS for lone wolf attacks against governments. It was not a hate crime.

The Australian attack was similar, and was directed towards the general public of a country labeled an enemy by ISIS. In that case too the man behind the attack was driven by ISIS, and even had victims hold up an Islamic State flag.

	<TEXT> Cocaine and other stimulants work very well in increasing dopamine levels for a short while, but long term they will wreak havoc on the dopamine related systems (and others)... especially when you try to quit and your body is still expecting very high levels of dopamine (but has suppressed more natural production due to previous excesses).

I would definitely not recommend it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's due to levels of neurotransmitters in your brain changing due to large variety of physiological, environmental, and emotional factors. There are likely a lot of neurotransmitters in play that have a huge impact on motivation, but currently the most well-known is one called "Dopamine". 

People who have disorders involving dopamine regulation dysfunction (such as Parkinson's, some forms of Depression, MS, etc) have severe disruption in motivation. The lower the dopamine production/uptake, the lower the motivation. They lack what would be considered a normal motivation drive, and typically see improvements in this motivation when undergoing pharmaceutical therapy to increase levels of dopamine.

So what can you do to influence dopamine? Well, the field is still very young and is full of unknowns, but it seems that one way to increase dopamine in healthy individuals is to have them partake in activities they **enjoy**. Exercise also has an effect on dopamine levels and as a result may increase levels of motivation. 

So if you're feeling unmotivated, perhaps it'd be wise to spend some time among friends or go for a quick jog/walk/bike ride before returning to your work. It could have a very positive impact. </TEXT>

If they are estimating the collapse based on the dwindling number of new malls being built that seems like a poor metric. Many of those malls built prior to 2008 were bad ideas, and now the backers realize that... so why would they build more? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Because of rising nationalism and the perception that people are willing to sacrifice more to expand their country. If he backs down now Russia will look weak, mostly because of the language used by both sides in their "demands". Russia leadership has to make it look like they've won something, and they likely bit off more than they can chew when they weren't satisfied with Crimea. If they lose ground Russia will appear weak and nationalism will fall, and meanwhile the economy will still be in tatters. 

I think they also want to make a strong statement for why Baltic states should not move towards NATO, and it's because of the threat of "separatism" (aka being invaded by Russia under a guise).  Imposing fear of demise (country, person or otherwise) is a tactic that works well. Just look at the case of former KGB agent that was poisoned with plutonium in Western Europe after publicly challenging Putin and his ways. You can bet your ass such people will now be much more hesitant to publicly criticize Putin if they previously served with him or were in a position of power.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Interesting. I wonder how this will affect the job market. From my perspective things are starting to slow down in the engineering market, or at the least becoming saturated. When I used to do interviews as late as 2012 for my employer it became a bidding/benefits war to get the top talent... Now we often have many very high quality candidates to choose from that have been looking for work for months, usually after jumping ship from startups.

Even though those 100k IBM employees being let go surely aren't all engineers, it's gotta have some impact on that already changing market. It's going to be interesting times for sure... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's becoming clear that Russia is not going to back down. NATO really isn't standing up for Ukraine outside of harsh remarks. Even though Ukraine is not a member of NATO, the threat of Russian advancement and land grabs is a major threat to members, especially when it's done in a way that's so hard to prove (with Russia claiming the Russians there are "volunteers").

NATO should begin providing Ukraine with better defense and anti-tank equipment and if necessary more offensive weapons too. Russia is not going to wave the flag of surrender, so the best thing to do is forcefully halt the advance and deal with the consequences of previous incursions and land exchanges. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> "Confirmed on twitter?"

That link isn't even the same thing. Their report says there were unconfirmed reports on twitter of an execution and the hostage situation is still unknown. Your "article" AND your spammy reddit submission from yesterday both stated that the hostages had been executed.

All your posts are for the same damn spam website.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No. That's a ridiculously large amount of grain. It must be at a major port? We took in about 40 loads daily during the Summer with the average load coming out to around 700 bushels per truck (our trucks weren't semi's, but they were still fairly large). That comes out to 28,000 bushels per day. Let's say we had 60 days of loads coming in at that rate, though it was actually over a longer period due to different source regions and grain coming out of other neighbor's storage. That puts us at 1,680,000 bushels of incoming loads per summer.

According to Google the average weight per bushel of wheat is 60lbs, which gives us a grand total estimate of 100,800,000 lbs coming into the elevator (and also eventually leaving it) for a total of ~50,000 tons per year. That's a drop in the bucket compared to what your elevator has coming in. 

With the physics of heat and aging aside, one year at your elevator is equal to 60 years in ours. Which means we shouldn't have to worry about replacing out chutes until... oh... about the year 2240 =)

	<TEXT> Most likely the chutes are poorly engineered, and/or perhaps the metal is softer than it should be? My family has a grain elevator that has functioned with very high traffic every summer/fall, and spring. During the summer when everyone is harvesting, it's in constant use (neighbors use it too) from about 7AM to 11PM. 

It was built in the 40s, and I've never seen anything like the damage to your chute, especially after 5-10 years. Our chutes and pipes are shined up for sure, but structurally sound. Where was your chute located? At the end of a **very** large and high angled drop perhaps? </TEXT>
