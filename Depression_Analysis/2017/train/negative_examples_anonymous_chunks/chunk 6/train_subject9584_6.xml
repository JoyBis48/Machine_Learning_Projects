Dad yells at him to not hit, 18 month old waddles over to Dad, and with a sad face puts his arms up to picked up. Dad picks him up, kid open hand smacks him in the face. 


Later that day he took the kids to a play place for kids. They have a big sandbox there. 18 month old would go around and throw sand at all the boys and kiss all the girls.

I was reacting to 1. the quote in the link trivializing and marginalizing soldier's emotions and reactions to war; and 2. on why the movie was and to what aspect of war it chose to focus on. I never said that war movies have no affect on their audience. That's an entirely different debate of whether that is a responsibility film makers should choose to bear or not. Similar to 'athletes have influence on youth, thus they should be required to act like a role model' whether that athletes cares to or not. Clint Eastwood wanted to make a movie about Chris Kyle's life. What people think when they leave the movie is up to them. But it's not wrong to make the movie.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> "Wrong people" is a completely subjective opinion. The director of this movie wanted to focus on what a soldier (who I'm pretty sure is an "actual" person) goes through, so he focused on exactly the right person. There are other movies that focus on the citizens of a war torn area. If you prefer those, that's fine. But don't say something is wrong or broken because it looks at an immensely and impossibly large scope through a specific lens to tell the story they want to tell.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This again? Shit like this comes up every war movie. Remove the political biases from it and whatever motives governments may or may not have had to enter a war and continue a war. It's a movie. Soldiers enlist for many different reasons, and during their service, yes, things "make them sad" and a million other feelings as well. Humans enjoy seeing stories about the human emotion; at heart we are empathetic creatures, and are pulled to stories that pull that out of us. People like this "comedian" are infuriating.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I live in Buffalo, NY so I have some insight. Buffalo has an insane amount of infrastructure to prepare for winter conditions. The city and each surrounding town has an incredible number of plows and salt storehouses. They can clear highways and main roads in no time. 2 feet of snow on a Tuesday night? Bet your ass you're going to school on Wednesday morning. 

Other cities just don't have the infrastructure for it and, just as devastatingly, people don't know how to drive in the conditions, which clog up roads so those few plows that do exist can't get through. It basically comes to cost for these cities: is it worth it to purchase millions of dollars of plows, storehouses, salt stock and pay workers for the 1 storm a year or every few years? Generally, no </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Boston said the same for Seguin. He's doing ok for Dallas. 

And regardless of where you stand in the trade, if you think our GM and brass didn't do proper research when pulling off a trade like this, you're delusional. Is it a risk? Maybe. But "attitude" stuff is so overblown. Seguin got run out of Boston because he partied and supposedly had a bad attitude. If Kane scores 30 goals, I don't care where he travels to.  </TEXT>

Acquire as many prospects and picks as possible and use those assets to trade for proven young talent and get as close to the top of the draft as possible. Elite talent wins.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> **Castles of Mad King Ludwig** is loads of fun. I like it better than Suburbia as it's less fiddly without the population/income tracks   checking other peoples' towns. Plus the theme is great. Castles are awesome! And the Master Builder mechanic adds some nice depth and strategy to it. Easy to get to the table, easy to teach and fun to play for newbies or experienced gamers.


Of everything you listed, **Dominant Species** would be the hardest to get the table. It's heavy and a really long game. Can easily be 4 hours. 


**Terra Mystica** might be hard if people aren't into heavy games. This game is heavy. There are a lot of rules and sometimes they're a bit scattered in the rulebook. That said, it's #2 or 3 on bgg for a reason. It's a masterpiece of a boardgame. Everything works together wonderfully, it looks incredible and has loads of replayability.


**Machi Koro** is definitely light, but it is fun. If you get this, get the Harbor Expansion with it. It evens out some of the OP strategy. 


For Co-Op, you can't go wrong with Pandemic. It's a classic, and you can uprade the difficulty if you want to to make it more challenging. Same with lots of Co-ops.  </TEXT>
