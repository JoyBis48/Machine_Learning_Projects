	<TEXT> This is very true, you said it so well too. I do appreciate the effort it takes for my cats affection, It's like playing a really hard level to beat in a video game. It's frustrating but when you actually beat the level you feel accomplishment. But instead of a feeling of accomplishment you get affection. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am a "break even-er" And still mine. I own a few BTC and hash happily at 90 GH/s and still at about 6 dollars profit a day for the last 7 months. I have been in the game since 2011 and have a petty good understanding of how the price fluctuations go. This is the calm stage with the uncertainty if it will still be a viable currency. My "Gut" prediction is that it will be in the 3k-6k (US$) range in 6 months~ So I will not sell. </TEXT>

His was essentially over production of calcium on the wounded spot. they took a doctors rotary rasp thingy to it and shaved it down. he got a band-aid and one stitch and they sent him on his merry way with a lollipop. No big deal brutha! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you love your dog, bring him/her inside to sleep in your bed. Animals cannot tell you they are scared, but they get scared the same if not more so than we do as logical thinking individuals. Example: My cat is scared of floating balloons, She doesn't know how or why they float so it scares her (Cat Mind Fuck), we know why they float, helium is lighter than air etc... But get a picture if you see it again. Trail cam perhaps. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm pretty sure the old cases took AT style motherboards. The new standard is ATX so that case is no good. And the power supply was probably like a 230 watt, not to mention Windows 7 takes 35 gigs (For 64 bit) 7.5g is too small, That old AGP card couldn't even run angry birds. Try finding games and software to install on "CD rom". So, New case, new mother board, new hard drive, new DVD rom drive, new graphics card, new power supply, Oh and ram, lets not forget that= New PC. Your old CRT monitor should still work. If Emachines honored all that for 99$, They most certainly would Rock! </TEXT>
