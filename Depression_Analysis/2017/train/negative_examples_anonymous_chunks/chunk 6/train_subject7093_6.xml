	<TEXT> Serious question and all respect to this guy (rip). 

But does anyone know or have records of what this guy was earning on these peelers and how he had distribution rights?   Or can you buy them online?  

Has anyone ever used one over the years?

	<TEXT> I'm an upstairs neighbor and I always drop my metal oney? sp.  and the tv remote and a lighter.    Sometimes a glass pinchy too.     I always feel bad for the girl below me, but she has a black lab that barks from 8am to 2pm.  
Really sucks when I have a day off of work and try to get some homework done or relax.     Can't say anything to the landlord tho cuz I have two dogs which I'm not paying for.   I think they know anyway.

	<TEXT> I love you and I need to tell my scary moment.  

I was in 10nth grade and went to Mexico for 10 days for my Spanish class.   Anyway one destination was Playa de Carmen?   If I remember correctly.    The class was looking for something to do when we stumbled upon snorkeling.    We all had to pay and watch a quick tutorial on the Do's n Don'ts.     We took boats out to our location of course and the whole class jumped in (20+).    We were rushed on this whole situation cause a storm was coming in and no one wanted to go thru the process of getting refunded.       

Anyway a girl n I were swimming around a pretty neat spot with coral
Reef just a couple feet under us.      Which was scary cause the waves started pulling me down into the reefs and u learned you didn't want to touch them.       

The waves started increasing in size and rain started to pour.      I took a quick glance up while trying to float myself away from the reefs to see the whole class dispersed amongst the water.        It got pretty sketchy quick when lighting and thunder arrived along with a heavy down pour.     With the waves increasing I kept getting hurled to the coral reefs that were inches underneath me.   I kept my head under to make sure I could get out of this clearing and not get hurt.    As soon as I made it out I looked up and couldn't see any of my classmates nor any of the boats.   I could barely even make out where the beach was.    
This is when I went into complete panic mode and started swimming frantically to
Just a dot in my vision.    As I swam and swam
All I could think about was drowning or getting washed out to sea.    I finally made it close to a boat and started yelling.     Turns out the boat I swam to was not a tourist boat but a couple Mexicans just doing their thing.    They helped me on and brought me to land.    

The teacher started doing head counts after that.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No he just experimented and had fun like every other person in their 20's.   But when you are a public figure no one likes dealing with those questions.

I'm sure he will do it as long as the drug related questions from his earlier years don't flood the AMA.    </TEXT>
