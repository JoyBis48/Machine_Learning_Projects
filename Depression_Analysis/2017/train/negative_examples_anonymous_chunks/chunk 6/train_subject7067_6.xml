	<TEXT> Too bad playing sports or competitive games with pinoys happens to be the most unenjoyable way to spend time.  arrogant, loud, self-centered.  I have not had very many pleasant pinoy encounters in my lifetime. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I hate to admit but, he suffered from some powercreep, so he ends up a lot weaker now in this patch.  I think it will be sorted out now that 6.82   6.83 is done with, hoping for 6.85. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> you could say it was the fault of comeback mechanics overwhelming everyone, and TB took the brunt of the pitchforks/kneejerk.  But no one is going to see the fault of comeback mechanic, it was clear TB would have been fine had people known about Sniper/Storm/Troll at the beginning of 6.82.  At this point he's not the strongest hero, either a STR gain nerf-revert, or illusion dmg taken revert is necessary just for sake of not being so squishy.

Overall he's an okay hero, there are many shittier heroes, it's just the repeated nerfs to his squishiness make it awkward to play.  The full toolkit is not bad, silly weird nerfs like the movespeed on meta were really annoying, hopefully he can change that and nerf something else less annoying.  Only real TB players would understand why he's in such a bad position, so there's not much point in bringing up TB anymore.  Fuck comeback mechanic era, caused so many unnecessary nerfs to heroes that ended up shit now. </TEXT>
