	<TEXT> I'm dual enrolling my junior and senior year, but I'm taking all my classes there so by the time I graduate HS I will also get my AA. Will I enter a 4 year school as a freshmen or a transfer student? Will applying as a transfer help/hurt my chances of acceptance? Some of the schools I want to go to are UC Berkeley, Stanford, MIT, and Duke. My AA is in Mathematics.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I reeeeeaaaaally hope this wasn't a hate crime purely because I don't want to deal with the backlash from society. Why can't it ever just be about a psychopath being himself? Why does every murder have to be about race?
Edit: Of course I feel bad about it happening, just saying... </TEXT>
