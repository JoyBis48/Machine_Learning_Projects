	<TEXT> I've listened to NPR since the late 1980s, and haven't felt any burn out. But, I don't listen to it exclusively. In the mornings I mix my Morning Edition with local sports talk radio and sometimes Howard Stern. During the middle of the day I listen to podcasts of my favorite NPR shows or stream the music oriented WFUV out of The Bronx. I love ATC and Marketplace in the late afternoons and on the drive home. Compared to most other news media out there, NPR still serves up better news coverage of national events and world events. The other "news" radio station in Houston is just a delivery vehicle for Fox. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> [This is a fairly long legal article about the use of bear gallbladders in Asia and the development of laws in the U.S. and Canada concerning the hunting/poaching of bears solely for their gallbladders.](http://www.legalaffairs.org/issues/November-December-2002/story_todd_novdec2002.msp) For those who have licenses to legally hunt bears, things get tricky. They (or their taxidermist) can possess and sell a gallbladder (often with license/permit) attached only to those licensed to buy gallbladders. I get the impression that a lot of licensed bear hunters just destroy the gallbladder at the site of the kill so as not to accidentally run afoul of the laws. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> My BIG request for Season 4 of OITNB - A Native American Inmate (or more) </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-06-13 16:59:25 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> The federal government has major crimes jurisdiction over Indian Reservations in non-PL 280 States (though there are exceptions). I remember one Native American activist (probably Russell Means or John Trudell, or could have been Leonard Peltier) saying that the federal correction system is the biggest Indian Reservation in the United States. Litchfield is part of the federal system so while it could get Natives from any Rez across the country, there are several nearby in New York and New England. I'm pretty certain that there are way more Native males in the system than Native females, but, plenty of Native women end up behind bars for the same reasons the current inmates of Litchfield are there. I've done a little work on accommodating the religious needs of Native inmates, and I'd just like to see OITNB address, even to a slight degree, the existence of Natives in the federal system.

EDIT: TL;DR - Because of Federal Jurisdictional Issues, OITNB should have Native American prisoners. </TEXT>
