	<TITLE> Particle Playground Smoke Effect Help (Beginner) </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-01-27 01:27:28 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hello folks, I am pretty new to after effects so bear with me. 

I followed [this guy's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx0bKB9aL08) tutorial on how to make smoke in after effects, using the particle playground effect. So I got my desired smoke effect, and all is well, except for one problem. At the start of my 5 second composition, there is no smoke, but as you play the composition, the smoke emerges from the position at which I put the producer (or whatever you call the point of origin for the particles). What I want is for the smoke to already be at its maximum height at the start of the composition. I can't figure out how to do that. 

I hope you guys understand what I mean by that, and if not, I'll add screenshots from my composition. Can anyone help me out and let me know how to make it so that the smoke is already at maximum height at the start of my composition?

Thanks in advance. </TEXT>
