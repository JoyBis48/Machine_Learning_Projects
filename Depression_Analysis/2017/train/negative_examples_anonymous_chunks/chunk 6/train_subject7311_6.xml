	<TEXT> Hey, so lately I've been watching a lot of **Miyazaki** films, such as **Spirited Away**, **Princess Mononoke** and **My Neighbour Totoro**. I've also watched **The Raid** and **Raid 2**, and I think they're pretty awesome. I was wanting to get more in to Asian cinema as a whole. 

I like a wide variety of movies, and have no idea where to start. Are there any **large blockbuster** asian movies I should check out? And any **small/independent** films worth watching too? 

If you could give **reasons** to watch these films too without spoilers then I would appreciate it greatly.

**Preferably** no horror suggestions, as I am a massive wimp, however I do hear that some great horror films have originally come out of Asia.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I personally hope he does, he was one of the only redeemable qualities of the prequels, and it would be interesting to see what obi-wan did between 3   4. Unless it's just adventures on Tatooine. </TEXT>
