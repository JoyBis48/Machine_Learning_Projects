	<TEXT> On the face of it, yes. However, government and charitable services in most areas have already got their hands full with the housed poor in public housing and section 8. Very few places have anything left over for the homeless.

Ideally, we should close tax loopholes for the bourgeoisie, cut military funding, and use the surplus to fund mental health clinics and social services and education so that the homeless problem can be dealt with in the long term; but the powers that be have decided that this won't be done. Therefore, I stand by my belief that feeding the homeless isn't necessarily a good idea. A short term solution is to donate whatever you can to your local homeless shelter and community centers. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ah. For some reason I had thought that the Quebecois had a flag wholly distinct from the provincial flag. I was wrong. Anyway, the South should have a flag because we're culturally distinct from the North. We've got a distinctive dialect, cuisine, styles of music and more. We've got a rich cultural history distinct from the rest of America and in most places, that's enough to warrant a flag. 

That you look down on the South as simply being distinct for slavery is rather telling of how much you know about us. I mean, by this *flawless* logic: 

The only difference between the South and North was slavery, so any flag that separates the South from the rest of the country will be looked at with considerable disdain. A regional flag would be looked at as a desire to be separate from the rest of the country, which is a pretty shitty message to send considering the reason for doing it the last time.

German nationalism is a bad thing, considering what it caused *last time.* American patriotism is a bad thing because of what it's caused. The South deserves a flag just as much as the US and Germany do, I think. You've not given me a single compelling reason why we don't. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> True story, backed up by my grandma and his album of pics from the occupation in Japan: he made Tech Sgt (or some other rate, I can't recall which at the moment) three times. He would often fight and box off hours and get busted down as a reprimand when their unit commander found out. Made decent money at it and to this day has good bone structure, so I imagine he was really good at it. 

So Hirohito had plenty to be afraid of. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not denying that Russia's helping them out *a lot* more than they're admitting, but I think that the rebel movement did indeed start out from within. After all, Russians in Donetsk have been campaigning for independence [since December, 2005](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donetsk_Republic_%28political_party%29); so it's not without merit. People had obviously wanted it from within, so it really matters little if Russia is helping them out.

Similarly, most Crimeans wanted no involvement with Kiev since 1992. What Russia did there was liberation, not annexation. The people wanted it, so Kiev's opinion is really moot.

With all that said, Russia's play in Novorossiya is really quite difficult to predict. Many experts in the field of defense analysis see them as wanting to fuel a perpetual destabilization of the region, a-la Abkhazia, Ossetia or Transnistria, in order to keep the Ukraine as a buffer state, as are Georgia (which I really wish we'd call Sakartvelo in English, but that's another matter) and Moldavia. Others see Putin as a Hitler-esque landgrabber who will add every former Soviet republic back into Russia and cement his place amongst the Tsars and Premiers.

It's really hard what to tell. He's made a lot of moves in a lot of different directions. I believe he thinks he's doing what's best for ethnic and linguistic Russians all over Eastern Europe and sees himself as a protector and restorer of [Greater Rus'](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Russia). There's no doubt that he's deeply patriotic and his strong moral initiatives, however deeply wrong and misguided they may be, show a deep desire to guide the future of Russian society. 

My prediction is that if he could, he'd bring Russia's borders back to where they were in 1917. Since that's incredibly unrealistic, however, he'll likely be content to sieze parts of the former Soviet Union and destabilize neighboring countries as deeply as possible to keep NATO off his border while expanding the membership of [CSTO](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_Security_Treaty_Organization), the [EEU](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasian_Economic_Union), and the [CIS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Independent_States) while expanding Russia's role and prestige within these groups for as long as he possibly can. The extent of that timeframe, however, is something I have no projections for.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's an adequate sentiment. I'm pretty sure camouflaging munitions flies in the face of some treaty or another, but I'm also pretty sure Russian armed forces weren't a party to said treaty. 

Anyway, I wasn't aware of such a kill record for the Bradley, but considering how many of them we had in theater and how outdated Iraqi armor was, I could quite believe it.

And you know, thinking about it, a lightly armored, upgunned, high speed tank that could be dropped out of a low flying C-130 to assist airborne infantry in rapidly destroying hostile objectives would be a sterling idea. I'd quite like to see that. It would be much more persistent than CAS missions or drone cover and the psychological impact of tanks in infantry warfare would make it a splendid piece of backup to augment any air deployed mission.

The only problem I could see would be getting it past acquisitions without having them butcher the thing.

Again, armchair military enthusiast. You probably know more about such things than I. Thanks for your service, by the way. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's fine as a light tank, I guess, but isn't its place in modern doctrine somewhat dubious? Light tanks aren't really a thing. Their role has been filled by so many other systems that the whole armor thing was surrendered to main battle tanks. Therefore, the Bradley hasn't really got a tactical niche available to it that it can really excel in.

At least, that's my completely unprofessional armchair general evaluation. </TEXT>

The guy is a bigoted loon and his remarks show what I think is great insight into his thinking. Oh, and when you consider that most gun laws in the United States were enacted as tools to keep slaves and freedmen from liberating and protecting themselves, it doesn't set the best moral foundation for gun control as a movement.

NINJA EDIT: Let's not forget that these anti gun campaigners have armed bodyguards and famed anti gunner Dianne Feinstein not only owns a revolver but even has a concealed weapons permit. I think they just want to keep guns out of the hands of common people, the same sort of people who just so happen to often be asian, black, brown, and of other non-white ethnicities. Gun control is far more racist than gun rights. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There was anti-black sentiment everywhere. Still is. The South is just a lot easier to pin it on because it was much, much more visible here and because the Klan was founded here and lingered here a bit longer than it did in the Northeast. That's not to say that the north was free of racism, however. You've seen [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynching#/media/File:ThomasShippAbramSmith.jpg) famous picture of a lynching, right? Marion, Indiana. 1930. 

Further, Martin Luther King, Jr led a famous march against housing discrimination (again, the main form it seems that non-Southern racism seemed to take) in Chicago, delivering this quote:

"Northern blacks were forced to live in a white man's democracy, and while not legally enslaved, subject to definition by their race. In their all-black communities, they continued to build their own churches and schools and to develop vigilance committees to protect members of the black community from hostility and violence."

[Here is a Wikipedia citation that has further examples of yankee racism.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racial_segregation_in_the_United_States#In_the_North)

Now, again, publicly overt racism did linger a while longer in the South and persists still today in many parts south of the Mason-Dixon. However, the stereotyping of the South as the only racist region of the US is tremendously unfair to the region and all that we've done to bury these outmoded social mores.

I'd like to wager that we've come a long way, at least in my home state of Georgia. We've had black mayors in Atlanta for many years, black politicians elsewhere in the state, many of our wealthy and famous citizens are black, and we also sort of gave the world Martin Luther King, Jr. 

But this is all with somewhat scant research and just based off of conversations I've had with my grandparents about the era. While my expertise is history, I tend not to study social forces and racial dynamics as much as I study military history (principally of the US as a whole, the South, and Europe), so I will freely admit that I've got some details wrong. Therefore, you shouldn't consider this authoritative by any means. After all, I don't consider the Confederate battle flag by itself to be an evil thing and many take umbrage with that. (Note: the Confederate *national* flag is another matter and we really made a step backwards in Georgia by replacing our old flag with that.) That's another discussion, however, and I'm willing to bet that my premise of widespread racism is still quite certainly sound.

	<TEXT> They certainly did in the north. They seemed to have a problem with that everywhere. But they didn't seem to get upset with how much money they had as long as black people weren't near them or around them. 

In the South, where pretty much everyone was poor anyway, it didn't seem to matter as much how close they lived - just as long as they weren't better off than white people *EDIT: or pursuing relationships with whites*. From what I've read and heard told, northerners were much more keen on keeping white parts of town white than that. But not knowing any old people from the north, I can't independently verify that. I just have my grandparents' stories to go off of. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not to mention that the Star Wars missile shield's efficacy is extremely dubious at best, at least according to several skeptical analyses. It's essentially a feel good tax pit. I mean, it takes the finest minds in rocket science to come up with solutions for taking out satellites with fixed orbits. That we could knock a MIRV ICBM out of the sky - fast moving, unpredictable missiles with variable targeting, mind you - is a very fanciful notion. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Just another day. I've been on it since yesterday. It's not some sort of religious thing or anything, but my girlfriend is out of town and my own cooking is sufficient to make Chef Excellence himself retch, so I decided to see it as an opportunity to test myself and save the money that would ordinarily go to takeout for more constructive things.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's sort of the era when firearms technology wasn't *quite* fully matured, so we still saw a lot of experimentation and whatnot. Even cooler were some of the Soviet bullpup designs of roughly the same era. (Later, sure, but as I said - rough.) I mean, [look](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ee/TKB-011_rifle_1963_mod_Tula_State_Arms_museum.jpg) [at](http://41.media.tumblr.com/7a72e28a1515ba0c05c2bc27b8e75a19/tumblr_mt4turqlda1s57vgxo5_1280.jpg) [these](http://41.media.tumblr.com/47a9c5766f8652bdc6973df59d3a0377/tumblr_mt4turqlda1s57vgxo3_1280.jpg) [fucking](http://i.imgur.com/XJiuspE.jpg) [things!](http://i.imgur.com/OWju4GN.jpg) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not quite sure where to ask this, but this may be the best fit. Has anyone seen any reliable sites crop up with Donetsk People's Republic, Lugansk People's Republic, or Novorossiya conflict artifacts? I'm interested principally in flags, patches, and medals. 

As a side note, I've been looking for Transnistria militaria, too. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> To be fair, we haven't totally phased it out. Yeah, it's in a DMR role now, but it's still used.

Also, perhaps they didn't think to use a prop futuristic rifle? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A gentleman I once knew worked in law enforcement. He told me to answer unusual phone numbers with "task force" or some variant thereof. It's sufficiently vague to make scammers shit themselves and go away - possibly delisting you, but not concrete enough to be incriminating or a legal offense. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am a huge fan of Ashens - have been for years. Recently, I decided that as a test of will I'd go on a fast. Well, times got tough. In search of reinforcement to my fortitude, I turned to the [All Day Breakfast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueah-mOjDI) review. And then to the 30 Year Old Food Parcel. And so on in that fashion.

Fast saved.

You're a champ, Ashens. Keep doing what you do with your ungodly, cast iron stomach.  </TEXT>
