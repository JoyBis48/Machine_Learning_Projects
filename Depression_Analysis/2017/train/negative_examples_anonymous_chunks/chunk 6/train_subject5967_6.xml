	<TEXT> It took a bit for me to realise this. I initially dealt with those 10pm cravings you get by having an apple. That did the trick, but now I realise that this 'hunger' I feel isn't that big of a problem and while that apple is fucking delicious, I ask myself "Is this superficial hunger really worth the 100 calories this apple will give me?" The answer is invariably **no**.

My daily intake budget is set in stone so that those extra calories are just that, extra. Still love me some fresh apples though. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The 'fuck Jenny' thing was a massive TIFU post about a man who accidently discovered that his wife Jenny was cheating on him with another man, he then documented his clandestine discovery of her infidelity with the help of a private detective. It was this whole indepth thing a while back. He ended up deleting everything shortly after and people started noticing holes in his story, it was likely just some dude making shit up.

The 'F' thing is an injoke about a Call of Duty game. There is a cut scene where you're at a funeral and to progress the scene you have to press 'F' to 'Pay your respects'. This is of course the butt of  all jokes because of it being a stupid example of 'game immersion'. So when someone posts 'F', they're 'paying respects' to the poster. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I did and I feel rather crappy about it.

Many years ago I met and hooked up with this gorgeous girl who was on a 'temporary break' from a guy she was dated (he has the same exact first name as me lol). Anyway, we had a insanely strong connection and she contacted me after getting serious with her BF. So we started a platonic friendship and we had the absolute best time. We became fast friends. Would talk most days and nights.

Things with the BF had always been on the rocks, he was emotionally distant and she couldn't date him anymore. She ended up leaving him for me and we had the most incredible relationship I've ever experienced in my life to date. 

I've always felt kind of responsible for it, but I've been assured that the relationship would've been over even without my existence.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Lets look at this issue in context. Let's say you meet a guy and go out for a few dates. Are you going to be talking about how many guys you've dated at this stage? Not likely, I doubt he'd ask and you'd tell.

So in essence, it's not relevant. 

However.

It's important for you to know yourself. What I mean is, following the above example, let's say you guys date for a few years and get engaged and married.

Is your inexperience likely to affect your relationship with someone that you're now fully committed to? Do you think that you could settle down with someone when you've never seriously dated anyone else?

These questions are important for yourself because I could think of little worse than being married and having kids, then realising "Oh shit, I *need* to play the field". Which causes problems in the relationship.

Sorry for rambling, but I have a close friend whose girlfriend of 10 years left him because "she wanted to fuck around and didn't get to do that in her early 20s". Completely fucked him up, they were about to get married. </TEXT>

It's easier than you think.

I drink nothing, maybe water if I'm thirsty. Our culture dictates that you need to get drunk to have fun but that's total nonsense. I'm not going to stay away from drinking for ever (I love the taste of beer still), but my view on alcohol and the obsession people in their 20s have with it has changed over the past 4 months. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I compare any sort of past time to the most common past time.

**Seeing a movie**.

In Australia, an adult movie ticket costs $20~ AUD. That $20 provides 90-120 minutes of entertainment.

So if I spend $18 for a month of wow and get literal weeks of entertainment, I consider it worth it, by comparison.

Using a better example, I played competition 8-ball 6 months out of the year. So every week, I pay my $12 playing fee and I attend 3-4 hours of practice on Mondays and I play for 4 hours on a comp night. When you take a step back and look at it, the cost vs entertainment duration factor (for me) makes me consider a hobby as *worth it*.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think on of the problems is equating exercise with weight loss. How many times have you heard someone say "I would like to lose weight, but I don't have enough time for the gym'. I was one of those people not that long ago, we need it to be common knowledge that weight loss is primarily done with diet. Exercise is recommended but not wholly necessary. 

Also people find dieting hard because they think a diet should be excluding food instead of the better option - eat the foods you want to eat, just less and with better balance. 

I love me some steak, I really do. I'm not going to give that up. So I just buy smaller and more lean cuts and make sure that I have something green in my sides. It's so easy that I'm kicking myself that I didn't start sooner.

The final scene we have with Jesse in Breaking Bad. Where he's in the car, we get that close up of Jesse doing a mix of crying, screaming and laughing. It's an incredible moment which required no words. It was all in that facial expression - amazingly well acted.

He had been in captivity for months, saw his girlfriend executed and had finally been given his freedom after confronting Walter and gotten closure against Todd. He perfectly expressed that incredible mix of emotion to the screen. It was so emotionally solid that it didn't need a follow up "X months later" scene. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The fondest memories I have growing up was when my brother, myself and my father spend 6 months putting 3 broken 1980s dirt bikes back together. We would spend hours **every** weekend slowing building them back up. I learned so much and loved it. They were all in such disrepair. One was launched into a river, one had caught fire and my one had broken in two.

For those interested, two of the bikes were 1981 Suzuki TS185 and the other was a 1982 Suzuki DR250. We ended up having those bikes for many years. My TS185 sadly was destroyed when our shed caught on fire and the DR250's engine finally gave out. My brothers TS185 is still kicking around though :)

	<TEXT> They're so fucking different. I loved Oz and I love OITNB, but they're totally apples and oranges.

With OITNB there is no where near as much tension, it's more about the characters and their back stories. It definitely leans more to the drama and comedy side.

Oz is a brutal crime drama, holy crap do they deal with some real issues. There is always a sense of doom and worry with most scenes. Oz is definitely not for the faint hearted. It is an excellent show however.

To be honest, I probably wouldn't watch OITNB if it weren't as R rated as it is. This isn't just because of the nudity, it's because of the language and the subject matter. They could've easily made it a PG tv series, but that would've taken the realism involved with it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is actually a concern for me going into the future. I'm in the process of losing weight and getting fit again (40 lbs down so far, yay!). Knowing what I know now and doing what I'm doing now - I'll be keeping this lifestyle for the rest of my days.

But with that comes the fear that I won't meet someone else who is as health conscious as I am now. I've been on the receiving end of this topic and it fucking hurts. Sorry I don't have an answer for you, it's a tough thing to bring up. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So going into this episode I was concerned about Taylor Kitsch's character. The pilot has alleviated those concerns. He was the character I most empathised with.

I have a sneaking suspicion that this bribery lie will come back to bite him in the arse. To us, we can see that he most likely didn't accept the sexual bribe (since he cant get it up), but he's probably going to have to accept the potential consequences of the accusation **or** he will have to prove that he couldn't have done it due to his impotence.

I loved the pilot, I'm so fucking amp'd for the rest of the season.

Edit: Alleviated not elevated lol </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When I was 12 I accidentally stole a penguin eraser. I was in a souvenir shop and I accidentally bumped into a shelf which had all of these novelty erasers on them. I turned to try to catch what ever I had knocked over. But as I looked down, I saw nothing fall. I was sure something fell.

Anyway, fast forward 25 minutes on the next leg of our drive. I reached into my jacket's side pocket and found a penguin eraser. Turns out my subconscious is a slight of hand master and when I bumped into the shelf, the eraser fell perfectly into my jacket pocket.


Yes, I have had a boring and legal life. </TEXT>

I don't know of a single person in my generation who has teeth problems. There are some (mainly who don't do any dental care), but most of us have strong and healthy teeth. Look at the baby boomer generation by comparison.

Fluoride addition has saved the average person hundreds and thousands of dollars worth of dental bills.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Another week, another loss. 40 lbs down in 15 weeks :)

But that's not the main reason I'm posting. I'm also posting to remind everyone to **take a day off once in a while from exercising** .

For the past few weeks I've kinda gotten a bit obsessed with getting into shape, so much so that I was not really giving my body a chance to recover. So what did I do yesterday as far as exercise is concerned? Absolutely nothing and it felt great. Having an exercise cheat day is as helpful for the soul as having a cheat meal is for a diet.

I'm giving myself a day or so of rest, then it's back on the horse!

**Edit:** For the sake of clarity, I exercise on the weekends. Friday through Sunday. What brought on this break was adding extra days during last week. This meant by the time it hit yesterday (Sunday), I've been at the gym almost everyday. I could tell my body needed a break. So when I say *take a day off*, I mean take a day (that you would otherwise be exercising on) off. </TEXT>
