	<TEXT> As you said it, it does require a lot of commitment, especially mentally, because you have to treat the kids deliberately and need to listen carefully. I think, if someones not able to fully concentrate on the kids (for whatever reason), the person of reference is more likely to act pedagogically irresponsible... and since they are more or less responsible for the kids  development, they must thrust aside their personal problems. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's been awesome! Although it was tough sometimes, because either some of the kids where quite suspicious and had problems with opening up at least a little bit (which is quite understandable, since they were neglected for the most part of their life and don't even really know what trust means), or because they wouldn't listen. But after a while, when they knew I was there with the best intentions, that I cared, listened and that I really liked spending time with them, I had the best experience in my life!


May I ask, what exactly do you think you're not sure you would be able to handle?

	<TEXT> when it comes to every day life, I just try to be nice and understanding. and I smile a lot for positive forces.

in my school years I guided new students, to get along with everyday school life, showed them in which project groups they can become involved etc. I also volunteered in a protectory and now I'm going to volunteer in a home for physically and mentally disabled people, which I'm really curious about... this is probably going to be a decent challenge...
