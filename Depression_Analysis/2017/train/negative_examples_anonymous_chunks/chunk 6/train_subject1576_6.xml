	<TEXT> I can only speak for myself--but, early only (and thankfully) I got involved in AA, mostly because I was afraid of what I mistakenly imagined AA to be--a bunch of old men shaking over styrofoam cups of coffee on folded chairs presided over by the Jayzus-cult.  I was so willing and open minded at that point in my life I was willing to try anything to get and stay sober.  So AA meetings worked for me--and, it was at an AA meeting that I encountered the idea of getting a sponsor (mine's like a Big Brother) and more importantly I found the [AA 12 Steps.](http://silkworth.net/aa/12steps.html)  Working with my sponsor and support network I "did the Steps" which is a systematic way of addressing guilt, shame, misdeeds, and my fears about my damaged relationships.  Oh, and I didn't catch religious cooties--in fact I suspect that to the consternation of some in AA meetings when I hear too much God-talk I aggressively shoot down the notion that belief or non-belief in anything or any God-like being is prerequisite to successfully working an AA program--it's not.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Cravings are a powerful desire for (in this instance) alcohol.  By definition a craving is an emotion which if I give into it, I reinforce.  The way to combat a craving is to substitute other reinforcements--like recovery meetings, socializing with dry people in dry places (coffee houses), pursue an athletic endeavor or other interest.  If I don't give in to a craving, the powerful desire will disappear over time.   </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Personally, I treat every day, no matter the occasion, no matter the event, no matter the friends who are there or not, no matter who's drinking or not--as one more day in which I will make a decision not to drink TODAY no matter what AND doggedly persist in the commitment to myself.  It is not lost on me that many of you are struggling, maybe even obsessing over this holiday weekend (it's Independence Day in the US)--that's natural in early sobriety.  But if you can win the daily SOBER victory future holidays, or upheavals will be much easier to handle.  Let's celebrate our independence from alcohol this weekend!  Who's in? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Let me be clear--life is not BORING.  Boredom is a common *emotion* in early sobriety that with sustained time sober most of us get over.  My experience is that we are well-advised to be on guard around all of our emotions in early sobriety since our alkie-thinking can use any of these sensations as an excuse for relapse, especially anger and resentment.  Good work on the 15 days sober! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It takes practice but I try to never borrow tomorrow's concerns.  In fact even in the midst of a shit storm, if I can find the presence of mind to inventory my exact situation, I can manage pretty well.  I'm not perfect, but a lot better than I was just a few years ago.  It's how I handled being criminally prosecuted for tax evasion, how I handled being sentenced to prison, how I handled prison and the aftermath.  I can handle the challenges of  TODAY, sober. </TEXT>

BTW, alcoholism is often defined as an obsession in which the compulsion to drink is but a symptom of our mental disorder.  Put another way, my drinking was only slightly less concerning secondary to my thinking disorder.  Sustained time sober changed all of that. </TEXT>

What other people do, what other events occur, good news or bad--none of it matters to me in terms of alcohol.  I made a commitment to myself this morning, end of story.  And as far as I am concerned there is NO FREE BOOZE or beer--somebody always pays.  The alcoholic pays with body, brain, and sometimes immediate tragedy.

I am not going to drink TODAY. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am so sorry that you are dealing with this illness but the recommendation of Al Anon *is not* a meaningless gesture.  It works.  Let me explain how it worked in my life as THE ALCOHOLIC.  My wife started going to Al Anon meetings without saying one word to me about it.  I could see and sense some sort of change come over her that I didn't understand.  When I did confront her about where she was going and what had changed she explained that it was Al Anon meetings.  Amazed and genuinely clueless, I asked her who the alcoholic was?  When she said, "You." I was floored.  The seriousness of my situation had in an instant become real to me.  And while it would be some time before I finally got sober, I could never shake the message.  In her actions to take care of herself, she communicated what ultimately I needed to hear--the unshakeable truth.  

Good luck to you. </TEXT>

After I make my daily decision not to drink TODAY no matter what--alcohol is out of MY movie for the day.  Others drinking has NO impact upon me, and if it did I would leave the vicinity.
