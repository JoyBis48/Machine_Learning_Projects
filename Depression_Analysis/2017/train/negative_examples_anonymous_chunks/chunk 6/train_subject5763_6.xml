	<TEXT> I live in the south and I'm not originally from here either. The only thing I can say is that you can see the difference very clearly. In the south they naturally segregate each other blacks with blacks, whites with whites, hispanics with hispanic, etc.. Now for the hispanics  I can say they tend to stay with each other because of the language barrier but if you meet one that's fully bilingual they would interact with everyone regardless of the race. In the northeaste is completely different you can go to the mall and you see groups of teenagers mingling (whites, blacks, hispanics, mixed, etc.). Trust me there's a big difference.  </TEXT>
