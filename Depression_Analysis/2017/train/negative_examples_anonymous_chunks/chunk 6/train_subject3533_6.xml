	<TEXT> I recently started playing Crusader Quest about less than a week ago and I already have a 5* No. 9 and a 4* Alex, I heard about the Alex/Susanoo/No. 9 combo and I'm almost there.... problem is that every time I promote a warrior, I get Joan. Four promotes in and all I've gotten is Joan. I pulled Joan from a Premium too. Do the RNG gods hate me or.... is this some secret bug or something :( or is this really normal?? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They'll get DS once DST is off Early Access, but for previous owners of DS, does that mean we're just paying 5$ for two copies of DST? Did you get a copy of DS to gift or was it just not there? </TEXT>
