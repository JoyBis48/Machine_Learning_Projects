Look up how much unions contributed in 2012 to the general election (presidential and others). Were talking about hundreds of millions. Corporations didn't spend much more than that (recall that both Obama and Romney spent around $1 billion) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Anytime I hear the sound of a WRX, I always know. I'll be sitting with my wife, and I'll hear the faint sound and I'll say, "Hey honey there is a WRX somewhere".

But to be fair, I'm not always certain if it is an STI or not. But I also can tell when there is an Impreza. I don't know that much about cars, but I can just *hear* the Subaru. I just *know* when it's around.

Am I special, or is there something actually distinct in Subaru engines that everyone notices besides me?

EDIT: this could also be because my Dad had an old Forester, then a Saabaru (Saab 92x), my brother had a 2004 WRX (maybe it was 2006, don't remember), and I had a 2008 Subaru Impreza. Now I drive a stupid Ford Focus (darn you wife for not being able to drive stick!) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is really an emotional ploy to grab our attention and get us riled up. But really, who cares? 

Walmart has what, almost 2 million US employees? And the CEO makes $20 million. Who freaking cares. That's $10 *per employee per year* if we spread that around all other empoyees. That would end up being **less than half a cent per hour**. I mean really, when you are talking about a CEO, that is one employee in a company of hundreds of thousands. 

I understand how it bothers people, but practically speaking, it doesn't make a bit of a difference. It really seems more like an argument based on envy/anger/resentment than actual logic. </TEXT>

First of all, the difference is that mass murders is a **tiny percentage of murders**. Forget that murders is a small percentage of all deaths. That's not even the point - and that's what you dwelled on.

If there was something that accounted for .2% of all car deaths - it would be quite silly to spend all our time focusing on how to fix that problem - when there are much larger contributions to car deaths - like drunk driving and distracted driving. 

  The percentage of car fatalities compared to the amount of miles traveled safely is equally small

That statement is not really applicable to what we are talking about here. You have made some strange false equivalency using some bad logic. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I live in the Orthodox Jewish community in Chicago, and there is kind of a debate of whether or not we should have members of our synagogues be armed. Now, we would only want a few people in each synagogue to have a gun - we don't need 20x people to carry. It seems pretty split. Some thing it won't help, some do.

Considering where gunmen have to enter to start shooting (they have to enter from one side - the back, or the front), it is quite easy to kill them without killing others. You can keep 2x armed members by each door. I think having all of us completely unarmed is quite stupid, and asking for trouble. It's not hard to get into these places and kill a lot of people if no one is armed. 

And the people who have the guns would be people who know what they are doing. Like I said, I don't think anyone who wants to should bring their gun, but designating a few people by the doors I think is necessary at this point. </TEXT>

2. Medical fraud - 15%
3. Workers comp and disability - 40%

EDIT: renter's insurance can cover expensive personal items, like diamond rings. Easy fraud there. People also intentionally get their cars stolen (or simply give them to someone who will dismantle the car), so that's why I say auto/property is so high. It's easy for anyone to do. And since you said you spend most of your time with workers comp, I've bumped up that number.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  What if the armed individual is shot first by the gunman?

Who says there is one? And what are the odds that even happens if there are 100 people in the room? If guns were allowed in the church, there would be multiple people with guns. Not 1.

 What if he misses?

Then he shoots again.

 What if he shoots another innocent church goer on accident?

1. The attacker comes in through the *back* of the church. He isn't standing in front of a bunch of church goers. He is likely standing in front of the main door. No people behind him - no chance for hitting an innocent.

2. Even with the risk, the church goer now has the attacker focused on him. And with multiple people trying to shoot the gunman, he is down in seconds. **The odds that at least 9 people are killed - basically 0**

The evidence is on you to prove that this is not logical. I would be shocked if you could find evidence that suggested having armed civilians when there is a crazed gunman *would yield to more deaths*. Here are some examples:

  Mayan Palace Theater, San Antonio, Texas, Dec 2012: Jesus Manuel Garcia shoots at a movie theater, a police car and bystanders from the nearby China Garden restaurant; as he enters the movie theater, guns blazing, an armed off-duty cop shoots Garcia four times, stopping the attack. Total dead: Zero.

  Winnemucca, Nev., 2008: Ernesto Villagomez opens fire in a crowded restaurant; concealed carry permit-holder shoots him dead. Total dead: Two. (Im excluding the shooters deaths in these examples.)

  Appalachian School of Law, 2002: Crazed immigrant shoots the dean and a professor, then begins shooting students; as he goes for more ammunition, two armed students point their guns at him, allowing a third to tackle him. Total dead: Three.

  Santee, Calif., 2001: Student begins shooting his classmates  as well as the trained campus supervisor; an off-duty cop who happened to be bringing his daughter to school that day points his gun at the shooter, holding him until more police arrive. Total dead: Two.

  Pearl High School, Mississippi, 1997: After shooting several people at his high school, student heads for the junior high school; assistant principal Joel Myrick retrieves a .45 pistol from his car and points it at the gunmans head, ending the murder spree. Total dead: Two.

  Edinboro, Pa., 1998: A student shoots up a junior high school dance being held at a restaurant; restaurant owner pulls out his shotgun and stops the gunman. Total dead: One.

These are just some examples. *There is, in fact, absolutely no evidence in existence that suggests armed civilians leads to more casualties in these situations*. Of course, armed civilians can't prevent everything, and of course, there can still be casualties. 

There seems to be a logical disconnect when it comes to evaluating the usefulness of guns. If you want gun control, then you cannot admit that a civilian owning a gun could ever be useful. That would hurt your argument. For some reason, people believe you can't be anti-gun rights, and admit guns can sometimes be useful - at the same time.

What you claim, is not only non-verifiable, but it goes against logic - and no amount of anger or name calling can change that. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well I wouldn't say you can 'blame' the pastor.

 Where's the logic in that

Logic says that if you have armed people in a church, vs. unarmed people in a church - less people will die. This is true, and quite difficult to prove otherwise. However 'blaming' the pastor is not what we need to be doing now. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So it looks like it's $1.2 billion, **over the past 20 years**. 

That's chump change. Seriously. That's $60 million a year in subsidies. Based on number of employees, if we gave all that money to employees instead of Walmart - that would be less than $1 per week for each employee. About *two cents an hour*. 

Not to mention many of these subsidies disappear over time and are not renewed.

**For a company that has revenue of over $100 billion per quarter, $1.2 billion over 20 years is a drop in the bucket.  </TEXT>

That is a subsidy indeed. Although almost all of these are relatively small and temporary, or one time. I picked a few stores and they were either 1 time bonuses, or limited time tax breaks. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Some things I agree with, some I don't.

 Many of these smaller grocery/specialty/department stores pay their employees (50-60% of which are full-time) a livable wage, including benefits

Isn't that more of a factor of the time? Back then 'minimum wage' was much closer to a 'livable 'wage'. Not sure about that benefits part. I think you are kind of reaching. Small mom n pop stores didn't provide benefits. 

The Walmart employs somewhere between 200-350 people with 15-25% of those employees working full time. Each of the 10 businesses that were pushed out of the market employed 50-150 people, with 50-60% of those employees working full time.

Ok seems like you fudged the math a little bit, although your point is not completely off. Many stores that Walmart knocked out were very small (10 employees) shops, whose employees may have ended up at Walmart, and some not. 

 The Walmart employs somewhere between 200-350 people with 15-25% of those employees working full time. 

I'm not sure why you decided to pick numbers out of a hat. It is very unlikely for only 20% of employees to be part time. It is closer to 60-70% [source](http://www.pbs.org/itvs/storewars/stores3.html)

Is there a net job loss due to Walmart's pushing out of smaller stores? I think that's the question we are trying to answer here. The answer is probably yes, but it's not so clear by how much or how little.

You also forget to mention that prices for virtually all consumer goods drop tremendously because of Walmart, and both the middle/lower class benefit tremendously from Walmart's low prices. 

Also, those people who had experience in those small stores (that are now gone), probably aren't all making the lowest wages at Walmart. They either moved onto to something better, or might be managers at Walmart, or at least making more than new employees due to their previous experience.

I think it's logical to ask the question, "How much would it cost taxpayers if Walmart employees were not employed by Walmart?". It's a legitimate question. It can have a simple answer, but it is a question that should be answered, instead of condescendingly disregarded. 

Think I'm an idiot? Great. Tell me why. Leave the petty shit at the door. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No. That's not a subsidy. That is welfare, for employees. A subsidy would be if Walmart gets $10,000,000 for every store they open.

We hear this all the time about paying for Walmart's workers. Tell me, how much would we be paying those people if they were unemployed? The answer: **a hell of a lot more**. If anything, Walmart saves the taxpayer money by providing jobs - even if those jobs still require welfare, those employees **require less welfare than if they were unemployed**.  </TEXT>
