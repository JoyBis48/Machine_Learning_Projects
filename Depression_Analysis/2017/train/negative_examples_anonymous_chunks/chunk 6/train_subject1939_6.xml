	<TEXT> I like King--see username--but I think the whole "no one respects King!" line is pretty rubbish at this point: 

* He won a National Book Award (THE lit snob org in America) "Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters"

* He has been published in the New Yorker, McSweeneys, and other snobby lit mags. 

* He edited an issue of Best American Short Stories

* He has won lit awards like the O. Henry

I could go on and on, but basically, the lit world is not afraid of Stephen King anymore... if they ever were.  </TEXT>

Questions of race and sex aside, this doesn't really address the problem. Sales are highly correlated with marketing. Sure, anyone can self-publish, but when all the marketing is behind the John Grishams, Stephen Kings, and Jodi Picoults of the world those will be the authors who get read.  </TEXT>

I guess to me it seems odd to say you "don't care" for the artistic output of 50% of the human population (or more, since you are including black authors with women.) That just seems really odd to me. The range of writing by women is huge, just as the range of male writing is huge.  </TEXT>

Well you probably help alleviate that by making everyone conscious of these issues so they can't just be subconscious about it. You know? 

I always thought I read widely, but when I was in college and got into these conversations and I actually counted my reading list and... it was overwhelmingly white men. Now, since I'm conscious of it, my reading list is more diverse. No one forced me to do anything.  </TEXT>

Yeah it seems silly to be concerned when publishing is still dominated by Fraznen, Lethem, Gaiman, etc. The SF world, where the sad puppies got all mad, is still like 100% white men as far as sales go... and even awards. Scazli, VanderMeer, yada yada. 

White male writers are not a dying breed.

	<TEXT> There were a bunch of articles posted on /r/books and /r/writing about how someone analyzed the last 15 years of award winners in the major lit awards and not only were men much more likely to win, but the women writers who won did so for books that were written ABOUT men. Point being, sexism and racism are pretty pervasive and their effects reach really widely. 

You might THINK that sex wouldn't be relevant other than memoirs, but in reality people judge women to be inferior writers off the bat, publishers are far less likely to publish fiction by non-white writers, judges will unconciously favor classic straight white male writers, and so on.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well "essays" encompass a lot of things, including creative nonfiction. But there is definitely a difference between say a lyric essay and a high school English class essay. 

Basically, roughly, "creative nonfiction" is trying to be art of some sort while your average school essay is not. In the former, you want style, voice, formal experimentation, and anything else you'd associate with artistic writing. In the latter, you want to strip down the style, use a very rigid formula (intro paragraph, thesis sentence at the end, body paragraphs with topic sentences, conclusion summing up previous paragraphs, etc.)  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Man, 3.4 million doesn't seem like much? The cut-off for the top 1% is under $300k a year. Scalzi is quite literally the 1% now, and his actual yearly income will be a lot more (as he gets royalties from already published books, film option money, and so on). 

 I assume he still gets royalties from sales and stuff?

From past books, yes. From these books, probably not unless they become mega best sellers. It would take a lot of sales to earn out 3.4 million advance, but it depends on how the contract is broken down. 

In general, the way advances work is you get money upfront and your royalty earnings go against that until you pass it. So if you get $1,000 in an advance and you earn $1 dollar every book sale, then your first 1,000 books sold would go against the advance. You'd start making money after book sale 1,001.  </TEXT>

http://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/37i2og/sexual_violence_in_george_rr_martins_novels_is/crmx99n

Essentially, the storyline just puts Sansa back int he same position she was for most of the series, which isn't that intersting. We've already seen Sansa tortured and locked up with no place to go. It's just repetitive. So it bothers me in the same way that Dany's redundant storyline bothers me. The rape itself doesn't offend me personally.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  I guess I don't get what separates this particular plot line from any other horrible occurrence in this series. Why does the writing on this get second-guessed when horrible stuff happening to all the other Starks gets an ok?

I explained my reasoning above! It has nothing to do with it being horrible--I'm one of those who fully thinks the books are MORE rape-filled and that the show is not a particularly bad example of sexual violence on TV. In fact, some rape victims I know like that the show actually presents rape as a horrible and ever-present thing, as it is in life for many women, instead of white-washing everything.

She's locked in a tower and never let out (except to show her flayed women). I think he knows.

 I mean look at Tywin's attempts to control who Tyrion does or doesn't have sex with, 

Tyrion and Tywin are almost never together, not normally even in the same region. When Tywin DOES come to King's Landing he DOES break up Tyrion's relationship. 

 Regardless, this all comes across like backseat writing because people don't want bad things to happen to the characters they like. 

You've got me pegged wrong. I'm a total character sadist. Just think this particular plot line is stagnant.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  The problem is that what media you enjoy cannot possibly hope to participate in the most interesting mode of its own expression without forgoing some other or later "interesting" gratification.

I honestly am not sure what you are trying to argue here. I'm saying that some of the storylines this season have gone in boring, redundant, or nonsensical (ie Dorne) directions. That's a criticism of the narrative and the storytelling. I'm not complaining about individual scenes, but the narrative and storytelling failures. 

Obviously you can disagree with me about the storytelling, but this isn't like... "SJW" complaining.

	<TEXT>  For the character to remain consistent with how he's been defined, yes. What else would you recommend, that his character suddenly change overnight to be someone completely different?

There are myriad ways this could have gone other than raping sansa. Off the top of my head: 

* Roose could have forced Ramsay to not torture Sansa (he'd had several "stop just torturing Northern lords" speeches this season, so that would be consistent) and as a result, maybe Ramsay starts torturing Miranda or forcing Sansa to watch that. 

* Ditto, but Ramsay takes his frustrations out on someone else. 

* Or the wedding could have been delayed until after Stannis attacks. 

* Or Brienne could have gone on a rescue mission. 

All of the above would be consistent with Ramsay's character. 

 Or that the rapes all happen off page, out of sight out of mind?

Well I DO agree  that it is silly for people to be like "Raping Sansa is sexist! It was so much better when Martin wrote him raping and torturing a poor girl instead!"

But the storytelling and character arcs and stagnant right now </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Agree, BUT I do think there are legitimate criticisms of that plotline. I thought Sansa's assault was, um, tastefully filmed compared to many other rapes on the show. Obviously the Jamie "we didn't mean for it to be a rape" rape is the worst example. 

But at the same time, the character arc for Sansa was that she was developing into her own, learning how to manipulate via Littlefinger, and becoming confident. For her to just go back to being abused and locked up with no agency just returns her to the same state she was in for most of the series. It's kind of lazy storytelling. 

Similarly, we've had plenty of scenes to show us that Ramsay is evil. Do we really need yet another rape and/or torture thing with Ramsay? Even as his father is telling him he needs to keep the North in line by making people think they are aligned with the Starks? 

There were more interesting ways for the show to go. Even having Ramsay force Sansa to torture Miranda or something would have been more interesting.  </TEXT>

Like lots of people think that Dany wasn't raped by Drogo, but the actual book depicts her crying into her pillow every night as he takes her from behind and she writhes in pain afterwards. They think that because there is ONE scene where Drogo asks permission--nevermind it is a 13 year old girl literally sold to him without wanting to be--that he never rapes her, but that's some poor reading comprehension.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The specific Jeff VanderMeer work you cited is SF :) But yes, he's done fantasy work too. Agree it's "weird fiction" but it's also about an alien entity creating a mini apocalypse while a crumbling but near futuristic bureaucracy of scientists tries to probe it. Pretty sf!

 IMO the prevalence of the mega novel isn't really important when there are plenty of non-mega novels. And anyways mega-novels (aka series) can be great fun.

Sounds like we both agree the main thing is the author needs to read wider, as there are plenty of great short fantasy works.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> To your first point, let me quote her: 

  **If the usual big-fantasy detail is taken out and you only sketch a plot, you get a fairytale.** If you write real high fantasy in 4,000 words, details and all, it tends to be a snippet, not a story. **If its something set in a basically real world but with a fantasy element, its not fantasy so much as speculative fiction**, or alternative history, or a ghost story. That means that there is an **incredibly narrow taxonomical window in which short fiction can be recognised as fantasy at all.**

So I really do think she's defining everything that's urban fantasy, fable-like, short, magical realism, etc. as "not fantasy." She says the "taxanomical window" is super narrow. 

 As for the likes of Jeff VanderMeer, he's a SF writer and I've said a few times in this thread the "mega novel" is nowhere near as prevalent in science fiction as fantasy.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Walter is a completely idiotic critic, that's true. Every SF/F writer thinks he is a buffoon. So, yeah, both of these people wrote bad articles. 

 High fantasy is defined as works taking place in imaginary worlds

Her problem is in arguing that only "high fantasy" is "fantasy" though. I think that's what people are reacting too. She defines urban fantasy as "speculative fiction" and other kinds of fantasy as "fairy tales." If she had just said "epic high fantasy requires long books" that wouldn't be quite as problematic. 

 I mean fantasy publishers have always enjoyed the trilogy, but it's not just a crass commercial desire, it is what high fantasy is good at.

I don't blame publishers, I blame writers. But keep in mind that modern fantasy epics are way longer than the classics. 

The gold standard Lord of the Rings is a trilogy, but it is only 470,000 words in total. For comparison's sake, A Dance With Dragons ALONE is 420,000. ASOIAF will probably end up being six times as long as LOTR. 

The Wheel of Time was 7 times as long as LOTR. 

Modern fantasy series have bloated to pretty crazy proportions. Nothing wrong with it, but I don't think you can look at things like ASOIAF and Wheel of Time and say that's how high fantasy has to be. It didn't use to be that way.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Disagree, because what I'm saying is that the "world building" is plenty complete in one book. Like, only reading Dune or The Left Hand does a fine job of building the world (pretty sure the Hanish books all take place on different planets with different aliens, so they literally build a new world each book... at least Left Hand does). 

I mean, I don't think this is unique to SF though. The Hobbit does a fine job world building by itself. So do other single novel fantasy works.

	<TEXT> The Left Hand of Darkness is purely self contained, and so is Consider Phelbas. 

wikipedia: Le Guin herself has discounted the idea of a "Hainish Cycle", writing on her website that "The thing is, they aren't a cycle or a saga. They do not form a coherent history. There are some clear connections among them, yes, but also some extremely murky ones.

And the Culture books are all pretty self contained to. Dune is the first book of a series, true, but it's 100% self-contained. It has a complete narrative with traditional arcs and a classic ending. 

Like, you can't just read book 1 of the Lord of the Rings, Wheel of Time, or A Song of Ice and Fire and get a full story. Those books follow the same characters through long periods of time, often with a specific quest or series of goals. 

Le Guin's Hanish books don't follow the same characters or stories, they just technically take place in the same universe. 

It's like the difference between an episode of a TV show and a movie that years later gets a sequel. Sure, the movie is technically part of a series but it's still a complete narrative in the way an episode of narrative TV show isn't.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  I do think that sci fi gets to short cut a lot of world building because it is by-and-large our world, with some significant differences.

Honestly, I think this is not true on two levels. 

1) Plenty of SF takes place on totally alien worlds (The Left Hand of Darkness, Dune, Consider Phelbas, etc.)

2) Plenty of fantasy is by-and-large our world in the past plus some significant differences. Like, is A Song of Ice and Fire any further away from Medieval Europe than Do Androids Dream... was from 1968 America? </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  the author certainly does have a point that the worldbuilding that makes up the backbone of a lot of fantasy requires a pretty significant page count.

My counter: science fiction uses just as much world building, but--although big series certainly exist--it is far more common for SF novels to be totally stand alone. Even in a lot of the series out there--Dune, the Culture novels, etc.--you can just read one book and have it be a complete narrative. 

So why does fantasy require more pages than SF? I think it's just convention of the fandom. Tolkien started modern high fantasy and the other big pillars like Martin and Jordan followed his lead with huge epic series.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>   but what book should I just NOT read yet if I don't want to spoil any major plot developments in the show?

This is a funny reversal of the normal problem. But here's the answer: 

Books 4 5 are concurrent and cover same time span, so think of them as one for your purposes. The TV show right now is about halfway through the material of books 4/5 (while completely changing many of the storylines.)

So if you truly want no potential spoilers, wait till the end of this season to read 4/5. 

But since the show is already much of the way through those books and changing so much, you could probably read both without spoiling anything terribly major. It actually seems like the TV show will end with several scenes from the unwritten book 6.

	<TEXT> Depends on what we mean by plotless. I posted this article after it was mentioned in a thread (on r/fantasy) where someone was claiming that Station Eleven was plotless and prentious for not having a plot. 

Station Eleven though does have a plot and borrows from pulp sources and was a best seller. So the fact that someone could read that and think, "where's the plot?" seems to be telling for how overly focused many readers on on traditional classic narrative arcs.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not really saying depth is in the eye of the beholder, I'm saying that texts that invite many meanings and interpretations are richer than those that don't. 

Like, a children's book with a very clear moral ("Listen to your parents!" "be yourself and people will like you!" or whatever) is a shallower kind of book even when the message is a good and important one ("Racism is bad!"). When adult books are written like that, with very clear morals or a very simple overall point, I think that makes them less interesting and, yeah, I guess less "deep." 

I certainly agree with you that many works of supposed avant garde work fail by being simpply meaningLESS as opposed to inviting lots of different meaning. Some random art school kids banging on bongo drums naked while covered in paint might invite no real meaning or thought at all.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Work which cultivates an illusion of depth--whether that depth is inherent or interpretive is aside from the point.

By my metric, it isn't an illusion: depth of meaning comes from the text's ability to support and suggest multiple meanings, whether in Shakespeare, Philip K. Dick, or modern lit fic. Works with simple, clear "points" have less depths of meaning than those that suggest more complicated and contradictory points.

But I do think that you are conflating a lot of different things here that make your argument less sturdy. For example, I haven't really seen how anything you say is unique to literary fiction. All of your claims seem like they could just as easily apply to Gene Wolfe, Ursula K. Le Guin, Samuel Deleany, or any other number of celebrated science fiction and fantasy writers.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  I'm talking about it in terms of a feeling that you comprehend everything that occurred and the meaning underlying those events.

Well, I think you are mistaken in thinking that most adult fiction has "meaning" underlying events. Fiction is an artistic object, and the "meaning" is in the totality of the work and the experience reading it. The work that tends to get celebrated in any medium or genre is the work that is rich with meaning... in which many different interpretations can exist. Think of the one million different interpretations of every Shakespeare play that have been written or performed over the years. 

Certainly Shakespeare's plays have very clear plots, but they don't have clear simplistic meanings, which makes them rich experiences. 

Here's another example: 

The Shining. 

The Shining book and the Shining film (both of which are great) have the same plot, more or less. But many people find the Shining film to be more imbued with multiple meanings and interpretations, while the same events and the same character decisions and the same plot points (more or less) in the books feel less interesting because Stephen King has a more simplistic framework to convey those plot points and actions. 

What makes the Shining film better, at least to some, has nothing to do with avoiding conventional plot elements. 

Also, now that you've defined your terms more, i really don't see why you think what you are saying is unique to lit fiction. Le Guin, Delaney, Ballard, Wolfe,... most great SF/F authors have "unclear" points behind the action. That's not about literary vs. genre. I think it's true that most literary fiction has less dramatic action and less clear character arcs, but that doesn't mean that literary or genre have more or less clear "meaning" behind the actions and events that occur. 

 yet the entire book insists there is a point.

Speaking as an author who knows many authors, I don't think many fiction writers think there is "a point" to their work anymore than there is a simple, singular "point" to an orchestra piece or a painting.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They are very different books, but my point is that books can have a strong plot and still have much of the book not deal with the plot. (and yes, I read Station Eleven). Someone else mentioned Moby-Dick in here and that's a perfect example. It has a very strong, very clear, very simple plot. But at least half the book doesn't deal with the plot, but instead with side characters, side adventures, or just literal scientific descriptions of whales and ships. </TEXT>

I don't think anyone would say the depth or meaning of LOTR has to do with hobbits throwing a ring in a mountain really.

I'd understand you if you were talking about a confusing postmodern book where events and action are unclear, but Station Eleven and most lit fic has very clear plot, action, and events </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Here's another thing about lit fiction that might be the cause: MFAs/teaching. 

In MFA classes, you focus on sentences, voice, and character. I went to an MFA and there was almost no talk of plot. I guess this is still a chicken   egg question, but I think part of the reason is that workshops take place for an hour or so, so you have to read short stories instead of novels, and it's much easier to talk about the voice and style of a short story than the plot... at least in a way that would translate to a plot of a novel. You know?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I hear what you are saying, but there is a counterpoint: using a familiar plot is EASIER. It's already there ready for you to use, and people are way more likely to appreciate it. 

Sure, maybe some snobby high brow people will scoff at something formulaic, but you only have to look at the list of recent blockbusters to see how lucrative--and even acclaimed--you can get just recycling the same things over and over. Basically any movie can make millions by using a standard plot and buying the rights to a famous name (even if there is like no relation to the original property and the movie like in GI Joe or Battleship)

In general, people love what is familiar. Hell, that's what genre fiction is based on: using the same tropes and themes with only minor variation so that readers know what to expect. (There are forward-thinking exceptions of course)

So I don't think you are wrong, but the opposite is true too. 

 I think, in part, literary fiction tends to be plot less because it allows them to maintain that vague air of depth and meaning that could come under fire if it were forced to conform to a concrete conflict/journey.

I'm not sure I totally follow you here. Does depth only come from plot or lack of plot? Often "depth" has to do with the themes and presentation of ideas much more than plot, even in genre fiction. Like, Do Androids Dream... might have a standard noir plot, but the digressions and exploration of AI and such were new and "deep" </TEXT>

	<TEXT> "Plot" is no more essential to a novel than anything else. Lots of great books have classic, standard plots. Lots don't. 

I like a good conventional plot, but they are normally pretty unrealistic and rest on coincidences, unrealistic character triumphs, and other artificial devices. Because of that, lit fiction probably tends more toward plotless books since it tends to want to be more "realistic." (The non-realistic literary fiction works: postmodern, magical realism, whatever, tend to have more plot than the domestic realism stuff.)  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> yeah it's an interesting topic, that we obviously talked about on here a lot with the Ishiguro / Le Guin flap. 

I do think that it's very possible to absorb genre tropes in today's world without ever reading genre. You know? Like I knew the tropes of noir from Calvin + Hobbes comics and kids cartoons when they did parodies of them. It would be very easy to write a novel that incorporated tropes without ever having read a book in that genre (but just watched films and TV shows and what not).  </TEXT>
