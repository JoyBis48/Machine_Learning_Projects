	<TEXT> I'm not a very active user and most of my comments hardly ever get seen. I'm used to having 1 or two people upvote my posts every once in a while. I got suspicious one day when I made what I thought was a good comment on a new thread and got nothing. So I went to /r/shadowban and confirmed it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Its a way reddit originally fought spammers. They make it so none of your posts are visible to anyone except you. You can't tell that you where banned. It was a good way to fight spam bots because they wouldn't know they where tuned out and go on doing their thing without bothering anyone. 

Now they use it for anyone they don't agree with. You get no message or warning. I didn't know it happened to me for at least 2 months. </TEXT>
