	<TEXT> So, many people have their theories.
My guesses are:
Victoria Argent and The warden at Eichen House

This list has narrowed as the season continued, but I feel like these are strong candidates.

Care to share your theories?

	<TEXT> Sam Trammell wasnt even in this episode. I think this may be the first episode that he ever missed on the show. Its such a waste of the character and all because of how some fans responded to him in the last book. I guess if the fans wanted Sam to be a random stranger who had no connection to Sookie, thats exactly what True Blood now turned him into. Sam Merlotte was Merlottesthe living pulse of Bon Temps. Now I dont know what he is. This just makes me sad. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> `The Knick' is a look at the professional and personal lives of the staff at New York's Knickerbocker Hospital during the early part of the twentieth century.

I think it`s a pretty good show if you dont mind blood and such. I totally buy Clive Owen as an asshole surgeon. The music is pretty awesome as well and I appreciate the setting and time in history a lot.

Have you seen it yet? What are your thoughts? </TEXT>
