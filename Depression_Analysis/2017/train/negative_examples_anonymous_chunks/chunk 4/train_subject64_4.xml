	<TEXT> The NYT article makes depressingly, horrifyingly clear that we remain very, very far from becoming adults, if by "adult" we mean recognizing certain unalterable facts of our existence. Our politicians, our military personnel, and many Americans still refuse to face honestly and completely the reality of what the U.S. did in Iraq, just as they refuse to recognize the blood-drenched reality of U.S. foreign policy in general. It is inconceivable that any of the catastrophic consequences of our actions, including the suffering of U.S. military personnel, should be our own responsibility. We therefore blame anything and anyone else, including the victims of our own crimes. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You're actually wishing that the Axis had conquered Eastern Europe 

Actually, if the USA had never entered the ETO, it is less likely Stalin would have "conquered Eastern Europe."  Hitler then could have concentrated more forces on the eastern front thereby preventing Stalin from advancing to Berlin.  Over time, the Russians would have pushed the Germans out of the USSR but probably wouldn't have had the political or military will to set up the Communist eastern bloc buffer zone that eventually rec'd the Allies' tepid blessing.

the wholesale extermination of Eastern Europe

If you're talking about the extermination of the Jews and other minorities, please remember that the USA did not go to war with Germany to stop what became the Holocaust.  In fact, [FDR was turning away ships with Jewish refugees as late as May of 1939](http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005267).  Here's one passage from the article:

"Sailing so close to Florida that they could see the lights of Miami, some passengers on the St. Louis cabled President Franklin D. Roosevelt asking for refuge. **Roosevelt never responded**."

So perhaps the "miserable racist fuck" you're thinking of is one of America's most beloved presidents.

put a bullet in your head, you fascist fuck

In fact, as a libertarian anarchist I'm the exact opposite of a fascist.  My guess is that your views are much closer to those of the Nazi party.  You probably support torture, endless war against Muslims and other suspect non-white peoples, rendition, domestic spying and the collaboration between govt and corporations in advancing the interests of the state.  I seriously doubt that you have ever advanced the notion that American society would be much better off if it embraced the principles of liberty. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> From the comments section:

Take an 18 or 19 year old.
Send them off to a needless, futile war in a country and culture they know nothing about.
Force them to observe brutality they had never conceived.
Have them watch their buddies be slaughtered and or maimed for life.
Send them home, where life goes on and no one really understands the profound change in their life and perceptions.
Let them deal with the VA bureaucracy that is consistantly overwhelmed and underfinanced. Have the VA delay or deny their rightful claim to disability.
Have republican members of Congress vote against a Veterans Employment Bill.

Combinatons of the above can induce suicidal ideation and action.

Most effective solution? Stop perpetual war for oil and private profit

Two days after the invasion, Keller wrote the column 'Why Colin Powell Should Go' arguing for US Secretary of State's resignation because his strategy of diplomacy at the UN had failed. In contrast, Keller was much more sympathetic to Deputy Defence Secretary Paul Wolfowitz, describing him as the 'Sunshine Warrior'. </TEXT>
