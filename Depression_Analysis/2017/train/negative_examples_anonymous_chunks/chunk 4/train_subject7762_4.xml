	<TEXT> Let's say you borrow 100k and end up not paying for it. The company that you borrowed money from would rather get some money than no money, so they sell your 100k debt to a collection agency for 10k. 

Now the collection agency "owns" your debt of 100k and can come after you for that amount. Since they only paid 10k for your 100k worth of debt, they may try to offer you a "deal" by saying they will settle with you for 50k. 

If you end up paying the 50k, you think you have a good deal and the collection company makes away with a cool 40k profit. 

This is how many private loans and credit cards work.

Learn from this and grow from this. They're not worth your trouble being bitter over this. Think about what you gained: the knowledge that life does go on after a "serious" relationship. You got rid of 2 shitty people in your life.

	<TEXT> It's very difficult to "force" genres on anybody. Especially when it's something as subjective as music.

You should try to stay true to music you enjoy or you'll find that you get bored very quickly. 

Try building your own following and then try finding some underground promo groups that like dnb. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hmm, I know exactly what you mean by being cliquey. You just have to put in time and get to know them without actively trying to get a gig with them. Build the relationship first before trying to ask for a gig. It's also difficult if they don't like the genre you play. You might as well go another route if that's the case. 

About the cd thing. I find it more effective than telling people to visit your SoundCloud  (or whatever). Because let's face it, how many times have you met a dj that you liked and then remembered to visit there page the next day? Now imagine a dj you don't know asking you to visit their page. You'd probably politely say yes, but never comply. If you hand them a cd with your info on it, they might actually listen to it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I make the same observations as you. I know a lot of mediocre djs who shamelessly promote themselves online and have managed to garner a decent following. I say shamelessly because their mixes range from awful to decidedly mediocre, yet their audience does not seem to mind, and neither do they. Maybe the audience is not knowledgeable enough to discern the mistakes?

Out of respect for myself and the art of djing, I hesitate to release mixes that contain amateurish mistakes such as trainwrecks, extended periods of off-key mixing,  or uneven eq-ing of tracks.

I'm not any way hating on them. We all have to start somewhere. I like to think that they don't know they are bad because they are ignorant to what "good" is. They don't even know that they don't know. 

I think if your goal is to dj to a larger crowd then you have to market yourself. Create an online presence, network with other djs and promoters, attend club events and mingle with the crowd, pass out demo cds. If you are as good as you say you are, naturally you will gain a following because you are offering a superior product compared to the other (worse) djs.  </TEXT>
