	<TEXT> Forget water stocks and other commodity plays. Human ingenuity consistently finds ways around materials shortages of nearly any kind, and you definitely are not the first investor to read popular stories about future water shortages. 

Instead, I invest in technologies and systems that will endure, making money now as well as in the future. Renewable energy is one of those industries, by the way; especially solar (read up on "Swan's Law"). Others include railroads, insurance, consumer staples, technology, health care, urban real estate and energy efficient buildings. 

To a large degree, it's not a question of what you invest in as much as what you *don't*. For example, you'll do well with a broad basket of stocks that just avoids fossil fuels, so you could get into a sector ETF focused on something else like consumer stocks, healthcare stocks, insurance, tech, etc..

But beware of fad sectors. Look for reasonable PEG ratios, good ROE, strong competitive moats, durable product lines and good management. That usually means larger companies.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It depends on two things: 1) how easily labor is displaced by technology, 2) who owns the technology systems and their output.

This is the "elasticity of substitution" debate that is such a hot economic topic now. I'm not optimistic about labor's value in a world bent on replacing workers with machines, and I'm even less optimistic about owners of those machine systems sharing a penny of their profits with their fellow citizens. Instead, we're seeing a retreat of the rich behind various kinds of moats: guarded, elite residential buildings in a few wealthy cities like London, Tokyo, New York and Hong Kong; wealthy tax havens like Switzerland and Singapore; gated compounds and neighborhoods; remote, expensive resort towns, etc..

	<TEXT> Iraq has been in the grips of a three-way civil war for generations. Saddam represented just one of those three factions and brutally repressed the others. So, when we destroyed Saddam and dispossessed his Sunni Baath followers, we naturally heard some limited gratitude from their enemies. But that wasn't enough to prevent many Sunnis from continuing the war, linking up with Syrian Sunnis, creating ISIS, etc.. 

To be clear, there was probably no way to prevent this escalation of chaos and fanaticism once we had invaded Iraq. Keeping Baathists employed and in some degree of power many have helped, but it is doubtful. The horrific regional drought was also a trigger that would have been hard to overcome. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> After being installed and cultivated by the US for decades, Saddam Hussein broke with the West in the late 1980s after he (and we) learned that the Reagan and Bush administrations had been secretly selling arms to Iran during his bloody war with that country. He then become the Middle East's worst bad boy, invading Kuwait, launching missile attacks against Israel and Saudi Arabia, brutally killing his own domestic enemies in an ongoing civil war, etc.. 

After his defeat by the US and allies in the 1991 Gulf War, Saddam turned to spouting Islamic religious rhetoric and threats against Israel in a ploy to unite Iraq's warring Muslim factions behind him, which further alarmed the West. He also threatened to sell his country's oil only in Euros, undermining the US Dollar. And, to deter attacks from his neighbors, he also hinted that he manufactured chemical weapons and was building a nuke, which, although untrue, gave GW Bush a flimsy excuse to push the US into invading Iraq.  </TEXT>

I dunno. Maybe a well-equipped, belligerent rogue nation spanning most of their northern border, just a few hours' drive from Ghawar and Riyadh? A rogue nation that had already demonstrated its ambitions by seizing Kuwait and spraying missiles all over the region, including more than a few at SA itself?

"Iran wasn't the target, it was Saudi Arabia." 

Tell that to the American and British conservatives who crowed during the Iraq invasion, ["Boys go to Baghdad but real men go to Tehran"](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2003/04/21/war-without-end).

Basically, a greedfest for an American-run military-petroleum complex.

Much also has to do with the American conservative hard-on for World War Two, which led to the ignorant delusion that Iraqis would "greet us as liberators", and that the occupation would go as smoothly as in postwar Japan and Germany.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Washington benefitted a lot from attracting higher middle class people

Cite? I would argue that Washington income averages are skewed by its incredibly wealthy elite and relatively small population. The state also has a fortunate mix of hot companies in tech, biotech, aerospace, healthcare and consumer services, as well as the largest export economic share in the country.

Still, poverty rates have risen over time and inequality is extreme. Once you get beyond the glow of Seattle, there's a lot of life on the skids. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> More evidence that voluntary savings will never provide enough for retirement. Hell, [half of American workers have saved nothing](http://www.providencejournal.com/news/economy/20141122-how-will-you-retire-half-of-us-have-nothing-saved-and-many-others-far-too-little-interactive.ece). They think they'll just keep working until they drop, as if any employer wants a creaky octogenarian tottering around. In many industries it's now nearly impossible to find a job after age 45, let alone in one's failing twilight years. Even Walmart employs few of its ancient greeters any more.

This is why the vast majority of employee benefits *outside* the United States are *pensions*, and, in rich countries, those are generally in addition to public safety nets more generous than those in the US. Let's face it: the American abandonment of pensions, with nothing sensible to replace them, has become an unmitigated disaster. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This has been underway for many decades in the more desirable corporate marketing departments and their ad agencies, where many senior employees once literally started in the mailroom, with no more than high school educations, then worked their way up into great upper-middle class positions, with plenty of company-paid training and mentoring along the way. Now the path to those great jobs is through selective graduate schools that cater to the privileged.

The result is a growing wall between less educated people and opportunity, with the scales tipping heavily towards those who can afford the high price of entry. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The social cost of carbon is very likely much higher than $50/ton. It's been repeatedly revised upward, and the longer we dither the higher it goes. [This recent Stanford study](http://news.stanford.edu/news/2015/january/emissions-social-costs-011215.html) estimates the cost to be $220/ton.

I know that economists generally prefer carbon taxes to caps, but it's a false choice. The intense need to completely quit carbon within our lifetime means that we will have both taxes and caps, on graduated scales over time, with taxes rising while caps clamp down from above.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's all about the oceans. If any temperature data would falsify the climate change consensus, it would be extensive evidence of prolonged cooling at all depths in the oceans, which we could only get from a huge network of deep sea thermometers that we don't have. However, we *do* now have a pretty good network of ARGO floats measuring temps in the upper half of the oceans, and they show definite long-term warming proceeding from the top down. 

The PDO is only recently confirmed and remains poorly understood, but that appears to be the key to understanding long-interval warming cycles. </TEXT>

That's why carbon taxation won't be enough. Sure, the dividend scheme solves the regressive nature of carbon taxes, but, ultimately, carbon pollution must end altogether within a few decades. Yes, fee-and-dividend taxation will be helpful and popular. However, in the end, the need here isn't to *reduce* fossil fuel burning but to *eliminate* it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The main benefit of this is that it solves the regressive nature of carbon taxation. 

However, carbon taxes will never be enough because, ultimately, carbon pollution must stop altogether.

Carbon taxes help, but they can't replace the need for that coming ban. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This. Most builders build energy efficiency only to the degree that code requires, so the key is to upgrade building codes to something like "passive house" standards. Airtight construction with heavy insulation and sophisticated ventilation. The beauty of it is that this doesn't cost a dime more than ordinary construction, due to eliminating big HVAC systems. It generally makes a better building, too; very quiet and durable, with much cleaner indoor air.

As for this article, I was disappointed that the author didn't really address insulation and temperature efficiency much at all. That, not electrical management, is most of the efficiency story. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  No one expects rooftop solar to power the entire country. However, quitting fossil fueled power as soon as possible may be the greatest need that humanity now faces, so *all* economically viable alternatives need immediate development. Most economic estimates put the net cost of decarbonization at around 1-2% of GDP, but it won't be free. But erecting price barriers to distributed solar in order to shelter life-threatening polluters is unconscionable.

 Fossil fueled energy is indeed far more highly subsidized than rooftop solar is, and that's without considering pollution and health externalities, which add several multiples to that cost.

 Granted, the taxpayer buildout of the national grid was decades ago, but it remains one of the costliest national projects ever undertaken. It wasn't merely the BPA and TVA, either. It was the Rural Electrification Act, the construction of mammoth projects like Grand Coulee and Hoover dams, and much more. I have no idea what the total value of all that is in today's dollars, but it's probably in the trillions. And then utilities were given monopoly control of these market areas, which has enormous value in itself. It's no stretch to say that utilities are way out of line extorting fees from taxpayers who do the right thing in net metering. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A few questions:

 Quitting fossil fuels is an urgent priority, and switching to solar provides a low-cost means to do that, so why erect barriers to solar that preserve the fossil fuels monopsony?

 Fossil fueled electricity is much more highly subsidized than solar is, so why compound those subsidies by erecting cost barriers to distributed solar?

 Much, if not most, of core grid infrastructure was built at taxpayer expense, and ongoing maintenance by utilities has already been compensated by granting those utilities market monopolies, so why are they due anything more?   </TEXT>

Prime terroir is now a quickly moving target, so the window of profitable production in any region will shrink. Still, it seems clear that the Columbia Valley and northwestern Europe will be among the best bets.

Still, for every new wine region opening there will be another closing, losing massive investments in infrastructure and old vines. This is likely to be a net loss to wine producers and consumers. </TEXT>
