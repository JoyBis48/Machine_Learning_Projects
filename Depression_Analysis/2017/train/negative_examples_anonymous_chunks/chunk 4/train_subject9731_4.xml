Buy your juice locally if you want to, I use Steam E-Cigs in Sydney, then go to nicvape.com and buy your nicotine.

Mix it up yourself dude and you'll never go back, you'll enjoy great tasting juices and can make them as strong or weak as you want.

Careful with liqua as there are a lot of fakes out there. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A couple things here mate..

The juice has nicotine in it, as your tank is not airtight, the nicotine is oxidising, this makes it go brown.

The other thing that might happen is that the cotton or wick is so dirty in old coils, it may discolour your juice a little.

My first scenario would be the main cause though  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My Aspire Nautilus always used to gurgle and definitely muted the flavour production. Even with the holes opened full pelt the vapour was low compared to the standard Kanger tanks you get with the starter kit. 

Later versions may have fixed these issues, but for me, it sits in a cupboard and gathers dust.

I should be thankful, the Nautilus is what pushed me over the edge to try mechanical mods and start building my own Kayfuns. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> HTC Folio Cover review </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-12-30 12:40:04 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So, I just received the folio today from Google, and bought the indigo colour.

Colour is beautiful, not too bright, not too extravagant, just a nice mint / blue mixture, like putting toilet blue in an algae infested pond.

The fit:
This is where it fails miserably, it does everything you want an original cover not to do.

1) it doesn't sit on the device properly, it constantly moves and shuffles over the device.

2) the magnets are WEAK. It will constantly fall and pull off as you use it. 

3) the folding of the rear tabs will almost certainly pull it off the device.

4) for what you're getting, its expensive.

The good.

1) If you leave it in the TV watching position and don't touch it at all, it works fine.

2) Google ships it in a box that can fit 80 of these cases in there, it won't feel suffocated or uncomfortable in the box during shipping.


Overall Score: 3/10

Release a new phone: make it gigantic and unusable with one hand. Make it overly expensive.

	<TEXT> Fight or Flight.. 

And this guy had the balls to fight, what a champion, and will be remembered as a champion.

I hope his family and friends find solace in knowing that he saved many lives at the cost of his own.

The other positive is that the cunt holding them hostage was shot dead.. As usually they'd arrest him, then hold him in prison where tax payers will feed him and clothe him, along with some fuckwhit lawyer that would be fighting for his innocence. 

Secondly, what's up with the bonehead news reporter from the US claiming this wouldn't have happened if we had more relaxed gun laws?

Let's compare the shooting / murder rates between Aus and the US per capita. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The N9 contrary to everyone else bitching and moaning about it, is actually a fantastic tablet.

Coming from a N7, the 9 is blisteringly fast and with 5.0 is a perfect match.

The only down side to the 9 is the crappy power and volume buttons that are sunk in too deep, and the screen bleed. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Why are the greens in general such a negative impact to Australia and its society?

You always seem to team up with the worst government at the time and do nothing but slow the economy down.

How are you going to change this and actually be more productive? Along with breaking the stigma that you're just another bunch of tree hugging hippies?.

We know all about global warming blah blah blah, what are YOU actually going to do about it rather than just telling us what you WOULD do if you ever had power..

Why would you even join the greens knowing well that you'll never stand alone as a party and will always be a tag along?

Sorry for the multiple questions, but you're the one on the stand doing an AMA, and this is my 'anything' I'm asking. </TEXT>
