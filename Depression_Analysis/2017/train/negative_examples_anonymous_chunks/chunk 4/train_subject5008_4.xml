	<TEXT> My parents (near retirement age) have far more than this saved. They both drive cars that are more than 10 years old and hardly ever go out to eat. My dad uses a prepaid cellphone from 7-11. My mom spends most of her time at work running a cash register. For them a 50 dollar dinner would be an extravagance. They may be "rich" in a global sense but it certainly doesn't look like it in their daily lives. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'll quote myself from another thread on this:
Doctors just can't win with opioids. 20 Years ago they were taking all kinds of flack for under-prescribing pain killers and not properly assessing pain. Now everyone accuses them of using too many opioids. Ten years ago they were getting flack for under-assessing pain in women and under-prescribing them opioids. Now they prescribe too many. How about let doctors treat the patient's pain to the patient's satisfaction and if that patient can't handle their meds responsibly it's their own fucking fault. All the opioid addiction hysteria is moronic. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Where was PB Woqab in relation to the DC? We didn't have a position named Woqab when I was there. Our positions consisted of OP Himmel, OP Lakeside (across the west wadi from Himmel), the DC, PB Habib (north of DC in the city), Roshan Tower, PB Kunjak (East of DC in the middle of a wadi), and PB Griffin and OP Panda Ridge (both north of PB Habib and I think built after the Brits left.) There was also "Post 6" which was a huge hesco fort built out east of the DC and run by the ANA, and an abandoned compound near a bridge in the green zone that had been blown all to hell (the locals said the british used it for a base). </TEXT>
