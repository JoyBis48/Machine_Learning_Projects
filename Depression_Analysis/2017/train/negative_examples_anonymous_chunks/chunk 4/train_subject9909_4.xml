	<TEXT> There are many names for the blank template of a felt hat. That is the basic form for everything from a tricorne to an akubra. There are two which resemble it in wikipedia: [capello romano](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cappello_romano) and [galero](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galero).

Most people are just going to call it a "pilgrim's hat" where I am from (and then say, "not the turkey pilgrim, the religious trip pilgrim!).

We moved to Maryland and after living in a townhouse and then single family home (and gaining three siblings), we bought a farm... Four miles from the northern border of Maryland.

In my parent's house there is both pork roll and pecan pie. The tea is sweet, but the bacon is crispy. </TEXT>

The linked story is a good example of what you could expect from a Sith "hero." There is a short intro plot in the first five minutes and a then a longer one which goes for the whole.

	<TEXT> I keep seeing mentions that ["...replacing saturated fats from red meat and dairy with vegetable fats high in polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats will reduce risks of heart disease."](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/12/03/fat-carbs-heart-disease-diabetes_n_6262590.html)

But I have not seen any studies differentiating between *replacing* sat fats and simply *increasing* unsat fats.

One would expect that in any diet the existing dietary fats would have to be replaced t omake room for the unsat fats to not simply increase calories.

The only problem is that people are using the studies to argue for less sat fats when that may not be the motive force behind the benefits.

I still need to find and read the studies but wanted to ask. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Then you should oust all democrats for making the state do more with less. They lied and told you they were doing great, we only need little tax raises (and huge municipal bonds). The education budgets grew and the transportation fund was used.

But nobody got a raise except the people with nameplates on the desk. Some people, like the county council in Baltimore County, gave themselves a raise.

So I don't know if you are a person who says "well, both parties are shit." Even so, tell me if there is another option: 

* Cut what things the state does.

* Cut the cost of how the state does things.

* Increase money available to the state to do things.

Then ask yourself whether the last two are remotely possible.

You'll find yourself in denial, or maybe start wondering if the state could do a little less. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I will give you that his definition of planning is restrictive and punitive.

 Urban planning is the idea that you need some sort of central authority to guide the development of cities, economic investement, and private development

I don't see why he would not make a broader statement which is more inclusive to the need for specialization in the understanding of planning no matter the existance of a central authority or not. He might just be a little exited or has an unreasonable stance on this. In any case, I think it is an extreme and odd statement that stick out from the rest of what I see as a sensible set of statements and arguments.

 Rather than understanding the suburban growth movement and smart growth movement as differing ideas that served different needs at different points in time, he tries to paint them as the same thing, dual aspects of this imaginary ideology he calls "interventionism," as if planners were just sitting around, thinking, "How can we best intervene this year?" The truth is, planners are almost entirely beholden to public opinion. Their job isn't to hand down decisions from on high, but usually just to try to make some compromise out of all the competing needs of a community, according to open, democratic processes.

This is something I want to respond to. Sorry this isn't a full response comment, I should get back to this.

 Ok, so I watched to the end of the video, but I still don't know--what are the unintended consequences?

Unintended consequence of Natl Highway system: solidification of car as dominant means of transport, bringing us car-dependant planning and relegating railroads to second-class land use.

Unintended consequence of car-dependant planning: Social stratification, urban decay, an institutionalized poor understanding of efficiant and dense planning. Also, excessive pollution.

 And what would the consequences be of not planning cities?

As I said up top, it is hard to believe he doesn't believe in any planning. The idea behind a free market is not to have no regulation whatsoever, but to have decentralized regulation. We discriminate against quality and waste, foresight and foolishness, health and disease, or find privately organized advocates for sensible positions on these. A sensible advocate for planning in a city would be well worth consulting. He is either wrong, or misrepresented his own position. I might read more of his work as I linked below to find out. Judging by how much they cut the interview, he seems much more composed on paper. </TEXT>

* In Baltimore it's illegal to block the sidewalk with a box. But the offense only carries a $1 fine.

* In Baltimore it is illegal to throw bale of hay (or of anything else) out a second-story window. That gets you a $20 fine.

* In Baltimore it's illegal to play professional croquet before 2 p.m. on Sunday. The law also applies to professional quoits.

* In Baltimore it is illegal to mistreat oysters.

* In Baltimore it is illegal to wash or scrub sinks no matter how dirty they get.

* In Halethrope, MD, kisses longer than one second are illegal.

* Ocean City: A law from the early 1900s prohibits men from going topless on the Boardwalk.

I have quoits. Anyone want to start a professional league? </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  The capitalists dont care about these cities fortunes as such, and they are happy to displace and exploit local populations. 

And just how do these "capitalists" do that? Through political force. You do not see political force as part of the problem, but you should consider that. If these people did not have politicians and bureaucrats who can use the force of law and supposed "public interest" at problems for relatively cheap buyoffs, then there would not be so many problems.

	<TEXT> The cold fact is that everyone did experience a higher standard of living. Inequality may have risen (not sure, just saying it might've) but that doesn't mean blacks were less able to feed their families.

The state of de facto and de jure oppression is separate in most part.

Besides, if you grew up in the depression, then fought in WWII, then raised your family in better economic conditions (though probably not better social conditions) you might have lived to see MLK and the civil rights movement.

	<TEXT> Only from 1 hour after sunrise to 1 hour before sunset. A sword classifies as a "dangerous weapon," even if it is not specifically called out. Exceptions include hunting trips and transport.

It must not be concealed.

The charge of "Disturbing the Peace" is what I would expect to see if a police officer saw someone with a dangerous weapon.

The interesting part, for me, is that it does not saw anything about use. If you want to go practice /r/wma with a friend you can do so in public with real swords (but even training or wooden swords would be considered "d.w." imo). One would have to look up the rules for parks to see what restrictions are present. </TEXT>
