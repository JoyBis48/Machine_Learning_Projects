	<TEXT> I haven't watched it straight through from Season 1, because I didn't catch on in time, but man, what a great show.

Strangely enough, it's on DLife here in Tokyo, and D means Disney.

Anyways, I digress, I really like the stories on an individual basis, but there's an ongoing arc involving the Aaron Hotchner character and boy....

I'm not going to go into any details, because spoilers for anyone who hasn't watched it but would like to, but I'm into Season 5.

Wow. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Went over to Kawaguchi (Saitama) for dinner and it seems as though they're having a Tanabata candle festival going on right now in Nishi-guchi Park! Yay! A little late to promote this, but if I recall, usually 4 or 5 days before Tanabata, they have an street festival on the east side of the station.
