	<TEXT> I was thinking (instead of catching frisbees) about support. From others. I started to relate it to a bed of nails. Have you ever laid on one? It's painless (unless your hair gets caught!). Why? Because there are so many nails to rely on. Think of your supports, whether drawing, or a friend, or a sibling, destroying bubblewrap, painting, whatever those supports are that stop you from self harming at that moment, as the nails in the nail bed. It REALLY hurts to lay on just one nail alone, and if the bed of nails is just in the sky, you will fall without support. The more you have, the better and easier it is. I'm getting somewhere with this. And where I'm going is, find something. Some type of support for yourself. You can talk to someone, draw, sing, listen to music, or do something silly like wear as many shoes as possible then make noises, it doesn't matter! If it stops you from hurting yourself or others, do it! I'd like to find someone who went to the ER for drawing their cat as the Mona Lisa. 

* **TL;DR:** The more nails (supports) you have, the less it hurts.  </TEXT>

2: I've always thought they open in front, but then again it's right and left with robes and cloaks with me. 
3: I think the plain robes are a requirement for first years, as your crest and colors get added once you're sorted. 
4: Maybe the hoods attach? I think it might be the cloaks that have a hood.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I actually agree with this a ton. Harry was quite the asshole in the last book. Ron and Hermione were *constantly* trying to help and instead of contributing to the suggestions they gave him, he decided to do what he wanted and argued with them about why they were wrong. We get it Harry, you have no family. No need to start all of the angst so soon. Leave it in the fanfiction please. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Other than that I've spent the past fifteen minutes trying to catch the snitch, I actually ended up seeing Dumbledore in a new light going for round two of the books. I was completely with Snape when he said Dumbledore had practically raised Harry like a pig for slaughter. I don't know if I didn't see it the first time because of all of that Dumbledore sparkle or what, but it took a second reading of the whole series and some movie watching to see how that worked. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I had a [horrible] friend that was homeschooled. She entered public school in 7th grade. Bad move. Her social skills were HORRIBLE. As in, she had her own cell phone, but left it at home (which was across the street from school) so she would use one of our cell phones. I'm fine letting my friends use my phone if their's is dead, they don't have one, or they forgot it that day. But she does it intentionally. She also had a bad habit of being...stuck up? Nosy? Acted like she was better and knew more because she skipped a grade. Not to mention, all of the times I have invited her over, she never slept over. Once she had a mattress to herself, a lamp on, all the pillows and blankets necessary, and then insisted on turning a fan on (in October!). Two of us were already sharing a mattress and one was on a pile of blankets, so we were ticked. Then she left at about 11 to which we were all happy. Sorry if this seemed more like a rant, and I could go on, but from my experiences, many of the homeschool (even private school) students I've met have not been pleasant. I have met a total of one homeschool student that was nice, but she also has been in sports, therefore, interacting. </TEXT>

Anyone who volunteers, no personal information will be shared (except my teacher of course)!
