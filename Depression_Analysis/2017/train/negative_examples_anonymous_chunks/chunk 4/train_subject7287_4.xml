	<TEXT> I'm a rising Junior in high school and am taking all my classes at a local community college next year. Part of the process for me was taking the CLEP college algebra exam because I took Calc 1 last year and want to go to Calc 2. It's scaled from 20-80 points. I winded up getting 75 and a couple hours later I got an email from Quest Bridge about them. Coincidence? Is this because of that score? Is that program even something too look into. I am in need of financial help for college and many of the schools I'm looking at are on their partner list. 
TLDR; Is Quest Bridge legit? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I understand completely. It's like you could be talking with a group of 30 people and yet you still feel alone because nobody is on the same "wavelength" as you. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've been relatively recently diagnosed and I feel like there is now this thing inside of me that is controlling everything about me. There were things about me that I used to like and now I just think I'm only that way because of my condition and it's not really me. Anyone else feel this way, if so how do you cope with this? </TEXT>
