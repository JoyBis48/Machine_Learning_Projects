	<TEXT> I never claimed that cutting taxes are to be blamed for falling oil prices, I have no idea where you get that idea. The only thing I cited was that the tax cuts made things bad, low oil prices (a completely different issue from govt funding) made things worse because it means lower revenue than what they would have had if the prices were higher. To be clear low taxes didn't cause low oil prices, and I never claimed as such. Low taxes on high oil prices brings in more revenue than low taxes on low oil prices, that is it. Also I never said that there can't be cuts, my issue is that so much has already been cut how much is there left? 


also I never laid all the blame on low taxes, I lay the majority of the blame </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well that isn't because of a tax cut, is it? I mean, can you show me how LA tax cuts have cratered the world wide price of oil? If not, then placing all the blame on taxes is just silly.

Of course falling oil prices aren't because of taxes. The point is that Jindal was banking on high oil prices to help the state out of the huge hole they put themselves in and didn't have a plan B just in case. 

Again, raising taxes is only one option/tool there. The other option/tool is to address the spending that has increased $2B from 2012 to 2014.The fact that they choose not to question the spending side of the equation doesn't mean that it doesn't exist or that it is automatically all because of less taxes.Call me crazy, but I doubt that the tax increases somehow magically caused spending to rise by $2B in 2 years, but I'm happy to look at what you've got.

First this statement doesn't make any sense to me. The state is in a $1.6B budget gap, you don't get that way by just increasing spending you get that way by cutting revenue as well. You can't get out of this mess by just cutting everything, you need to raise revenue as well. If you cut everything you end up with shitty road, schools, government services etc. You keep sighting this $2B and yet I can find that figure in the document you provided in another comment (could you at least cite a page or pages, I don't have time to read a 120pg document). Also how could tax increases cause spending to rise? More to the point they didn't raise taxes at all, they cut them or let them stay as is. This contributed to the mess they are in.

	<TEXT>  Year after year, Louisiana didn't have enough money to cover its expenses, yet Gov. Bobby Jindal refused to roll back income tax cuts or ever-increasing corporate tax breaks. Instead, he raided reserve funds and sold off state property.Jindal suggested job growth from his economic development wins would replenish those assets once the recession ended. It hasn't  and money from the lucrative oil industry has taken a nose dive with crude prices. Now, the Republican is running out of short-term patches and is struggling to plug a $1.6 billion budget hole just as he tries to build support for a possible 2016 presidential run.

[source: The (Baton Rouge) Advocate ](http://theadvocate.com/news/11576704-123/out-of-tricks-how-louisiana) 

Most blame the $1.6 billion budget gap on Jindals rigid refusal to raise taxes, which originates in a pledge he signed with Grover Norquist, sultan of the GOPs anti-tax wing. For years, Jindal has been siphoning money from dedicated funds or one-time payouts to make up for the states lack of revenue.Now, even members of his own party are criticizing him for his management of Louisianas finances.

	<TEXT> It is a title loan place. 
In the United States, a car title loan, also called an auto title loan, vehicle title loan, pink slip loan, or simply title loan, is a type of secured loan where the borrower can use their vehicle title as collateral. Borrowers who get title loans must allow a lender to place a lien on their car title, and temporarily surrender the hard copy of their vehicle title, in exchange for a loan amount. When the loan is repaid, the lien is removed and the car title is returned to its owner. If the borrower defaults on their payments then the lender is liable to repossess the vehicle and sell it to repay the borrowers outstanding debt.

	<TEXT> The Chattahoochee River is damed in North Georgia (Lake Lanier) and is a vital supply of drinking water for the Atlanta area. Naturally Georgia doesn't like to let too much water out because we need it. However Alabama and Florida also claim the water, and would like more released for their own needs. Alabama needs it for its nuclear power plants along the Chattahoochee.  Florida needs lots of water because the more water released from Lake Lanier the more rich nutrients are realized that shrimp feed on at the mouth of the river in the Gulf of Mexico. These shrimp are an important part of the fishing industry there. Without the nutrients the shrimp population suffers and so does the fishing industry.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They were taken down because of cost. The station wasn't willing to invest in CC for the videos online. If you look at the economics surrounding the show and the market (Marquette, MI ) you understand. The station is the 180th TV market (out of 210) so the station isn't making bang by any means do to its small viewing audience. On top of that the station has gone through multiple owners who have had no interest in investing in the station at all. It's actually a miracle that it lasted this long and it is unlikely that the show will continue without him. If you notice the video in the WSJ link at the top the youngest people there seemed to be in their 50s. A lot of the Finnish culture/language there is slowly eroding as time goes by.   </TEXT>

Though a part of me thinks that this was conservatives retaliating against Delta for blocking the "religious freedom" bill last year (though that's just speculation on my part). Regardless the reason it's quite obvious that Delta doesn't need them.  </TEXT>
