	<TEXT> A bit of both, really. My home city was ravaged by a plague, forcing survivors to flee. 

During my escape attempt, I was confronted by a wolf. I didn't really learn I was cursed until my 3rd transformation, at that point, I had gained some control over the beast inside.

I have since made it to another city, but the situation here is so tough, I'm merely making ends meet by doing odd jobs here and there, before leaving the city at night, just in case.

And, for my dietary needs, I have been eating a lot more meat. Rarer, too. Comes with the species, I suppose. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's pretty easy, It was one of my first.

I was hired by a Canir - A canine-looking race of people - to find her husband - who had gone missing a year or two ago, who was a Human. Now, I'm not one for interracial relationships - but hey, who am I to argue?

Anyway, after a month or two I found the poor guy begging in one of the slums on a Purseus station. He'd come here to get some "Augs"

Unfortunately, the guy didn't read the T Cs correctly and got filled with untested Augs. Became a Guinea Pig. It was like looking at a Picasso Painting. Didn't want to go home to his partner, so he spent years on Purseus. Took him back after a lot of persuading. 

He wasn't the only guy affected by these cowboy implanters. Station #7 is filled with them.

But what got me the most, was despite his grotesque appearance, his partner still took him back without so much as a second look at him.

Love is a helluva drug. But you won't ever catch me with Augs, even though every other D in the Universe is rocking them. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Toan is pretty robotic, really. He's a little boring, but he's really helpful! I should really get a fun AI one day, just to see his reaction.

Travelling times between galaxies are pretty instantaneous, the gates enable this - it's just the travelling _to_ the gates that take time! Most gates are a few days travel from the more popular areas, thanks mostly to FTL travel. 

So in short - Average is a few days.

None of us really know how the gates work, though. </TEXT>

Up until this month's renewal, I was paying 2,200 for my insurance - I drive a Toyota Aygo. A reliant robin could probably go faster than me on long straights.

Seems like I'm plugging, but Insure the Box have brought my premium right down - my renewal this month is 1,011. Sure you're getting tracked, but I look at it this way - if it gets nicked, the insurers probably know where it is. </TEXT>

Was heading down Hacken Bridge Lane in Farnworth. (Connects Little Lever to Bolton, pretty much) and there was a lady looking a little confused pulled over by the side of the road. There's an albino Ferret bouncing about the place.

After a little while, the little guy jumped in the lady's hand. A quick box was made and she took it home - She said she'd call the RSPCA once she got home.

The little guy was definitely a pet. He was scared, but very friendly and ran all over my back and shoulders.

If you know anyone who's lost a Ferret, the RSPCA probably has him/her! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not sure, really - I'm not too in depth with the technical stuff - might wanna check for a virus or something.. Might have fuddled with your settings or something. But yeah, /flushdns pretty much makes your DNS server get its shit together.

Glad it worked for you! Didn't work for mine, though! Your DNS server is what "decodes" www.google.co.uk into 74.125.131.94 

Bash that IP into your browser, and it loads google. If your DNS is malfunctioning, if you put in a website's IP, it'll still load fine.

If your computer's DNS is screwy, there's a few public ones you can use, too. Normally a flush usually fixes problems. </TEXT>

From what I played last week, it didn't seem too bad - the combat was a bit standard really, but I liked the "Class" mixing you could do. I was running around with a hammer and a shotgun and was doing pretty well.

I did a solo dungeon and it was more based on infiltration and disabling security rather than tanking and spanking your way through the place. If the group dungeons kept this up, I could see it being really interesting!

My main issues were with the combat and the quests.

 When an NPC offers two kinds of the same quest, it gets annoying having to run back to the same guy, then probably run back off to where you came from </TEXT>

I was about 500 meters to the exit slip road I needed to take, and the road I was on was a sweeping right turn and my tyre burst. 

I tried as hard as I could to keep the car straight by gripping the wheel as tight as possible and trying to hold it right, but the damn thing was rocking harder than a metalhead at a Slayer gig.

Eventually, one of the other tyres blew, and I was sent careering into the barrier seperating the two directions at 60MPH. Head on.

Hit the barrier, but it didn't totally stop me. My car did a full 180 and hit the barrier with the back end. This stopped me. 

I was now facing oncoming traffic, whizzing past me at 65-70MPH.
Luckily, the lunch rush hour was done, and a fellow road user had pulled up on the hard shoulder when he saw me fling off the road. He waved me over, I was good to quickly drive over and hang on the hard shoulder.

Come to think of it - I was lucky to even start the car and move across lanes without getting taken out again, never mind surviving and having not even a single scratch or injury. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> but I h(av)e no urge to have sex with them, at least at this point.

That's generally the basic definition of Asexuality - A lack of Sexual attraction/desire

Asexuals still have a _romantic_ attraction, and are labelled much like their "Sexual" labels. (Hetero, Homo, Demi, Pan), (Just replace [X]Sexual with [X]Romantic)

Aromantic Asexuals on the other hand have no desire for sex, nor relationships. They'd much prefer to have no relationships whatsoever and just do their thing through life.

That's the best way I can put it - if anyone else can explain it better, read theirs! I'm fairly new to the concept of Asexuality myself - only known about it for a few months (I also identify as a Hetero/Demiromantic Asexual) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In my school, we had the normal kids, the chavs, and us. We hung around the same building every break we had. At first, There was just the 5 of us. We were pretty nerdy. 

We just hung around talking about games, and D D stuff. We were also into metal and rock, so we were outcast from the rest of the kids, who were mostly into Dance and R B and all that kinda stuff.

Anyway - 5 grew to 10, which grew to 20, which grew to the point where a few years after the inital 5 had left, the entire building would be pretty much swarmed by kids who were like us. They had to be dispersed at one point, I think.

They called us "The O-block crew" </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm overweight. Been so for about 6 years.
I'm 19stone (266lbs - 120kg), and I'm 6'2". 22 years old

 I was an avid swimmer in my younger years and took part in meets and races. Due to this, I had a ravenous appetite which I appear to have kept for the last 8 years since I quit swimming to pursue studies. One minute I was a healthy weight, next I was just getting bigger and bigger. Luckily, the fat has spread around my body, rather than being focused on one part - though I'm very concious about my thighs when I'm sat down.

I've started to cut down on my intake, as well as go for long walks with the dog. I can walk for miles and miles just fine, but I can barely manage 1 minute of running.

I'm trying the C25K program, but my lungs despise me for it, though I'm going to keep pushing! 

My ideal weight is about 80lbs away. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This one might need a bit of backstory to understand

Okay, so, back in September 2010, I had a tyre blow out on me on the motorway. I spun out and collided with the barrier twice, car was totalled.

Shortly after, I shaved all my hair off (It was a big deal, it was halfway down my back, had been growing it for about 6 years) I think I might have had a slight mental breakdown.

Anyway, I work with some very lax guys, not at all afraid of offending.

When I turned up to work with no hair, they fell off chairs laughing. Serial Killer [Raoul Moat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Northumbria_Police_manhunt) was all over the news, and I apparently looked like him.

I am now nicknamed Raoul. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not sure what it's called, I played it last year at Download Festival

It's fairly simple.
Stick a 1/4 filled bottle between 2 teams. The teams can be any size. Try and get the space between the teams about 20ft.

Each team takes turns throwing the "ball" to try and hit the bottle. If you hit the bottle, your team grabs your cans, opens 'em and starts chugging. The other team has to run, stand the bottle up and retrieve the ball and get back to their line, and shout STOP!

It's made slightly difficult, as the "ball" is off shaped (We used Toilet Roll wrapped up in Duct tape) and is prone to bouncing all over the place.
Also, if that wasn't bad enough, if you somehow knock over one of the other team's cans, you gotta run and pick that up.

First team to get ALL their cans chugged is the winner! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Me and my sis were helping my dad pave the new bit of garden he was working on, so there was a huge pallet of bricks, and a huge bag of sand. I was throwing bricks onto the bag of sand, and my sister was running back and forth from my dad to where I was throwing the bricks.


I was throwing faster than she was carrying, but I stopped for a minute to take a breath.

I start throwing again, and I hear this pained scream, and "MUM! MUM!" 

It's my sister, running at my Mum with her middle finger raised. I'd thrown a brick right onto her awaiting hand, and it had made a pretty nasty gash right on her finger where the edge of the brick had landed. Needed stitches.

(I was about 13, sister about 9) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Alright, at my computer now, I can type without driving myself insane.

I can't really explain asexuality, since it's all I've really known sexuality-wise. All I know is, I have no attraction to anyone really. I can walk down a street of the hottest people in the world, and I probably wouldn't bat an eyelid or turn around, stare at chests, etc. (Well, maybe a little)

There's the various types of asexuals - Aromantic Asexuals (No interest in sex or a romantic relationship) and then there's the various Romantic Asexuals: Heteroromantic, Homoromantic, panromantic, etc.

I specifically identify as a Heteroromantic Asexual - I desire a relationship, but all that relationship would ideally consist of is hugs, cuddles, maybe some kisses, and generally sharing life together.

I know for a fact that won't happen unless I'm extremely lucky.

Some Asexuals in relationships might maintain an active sex life just because of their partner's needs, but won't pursue them to return the favour, so to speak.

That's probably the best way I can explain it. there's a subreddit ([/r/asexuality](/r/asexuality)) and [AVEN](http://www.asexuality.org/home/) (Asexual Visibility and Education Network) which can give _waaaaay_ more info than I can.  </TEXT>
