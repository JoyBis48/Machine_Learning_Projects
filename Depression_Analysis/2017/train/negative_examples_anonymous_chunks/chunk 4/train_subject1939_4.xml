	<TEXT>  They make it sound like every actor, musician, painter, or other artist has it easy. Well guess what, it's the same in the other entertainment industries. 

I think it's wrong to act like some periods aren't better or worse for different types of art. Musicians income peaked in the 80s or 90s and has been plummeting. Authors have been doing much worse over the past 15 years and advances are shrinking. 

Just because it's always "hard" doesn't mean it can't get harder or there can't be fewer spots. 

Being a tenured professor at a top college was always hard, but in the 70s or 80s there were far more tenure track spots. Now 70% of all classes are taught by low-paid adjuncts. 

Point being: things change.  </TEXT>

I dunno, I never got the impression that authors were super loyal to their specific publisher in the past. For one thing, editors and publicists move around frequently, so the houses aren't stable either. There's no real reason to stick with a specific Big 5 imprint if the money is the same. 

I'd would be more interesting to see how many authors would opt to stick with their current editor.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> According to this: http://file770.com/?p=21708 

the Rabid Puppies placed more candidates than the Sad Puppies, so it seems they had more support. (Unless it was all in the categories with low votes overall)

You can say he's a random quack, but then how did he get 9 noms for his publishing house, 6 for his author, and another 2 for himself? Plus other ones that weren't on the SP slate? (And why did SP nominate works he's edited?)

I don't see how stating the facts of who got nominated suggests I'm a conspiracy theorist. What conspiracy? Vox Day openly campaigned for those nominations, nothing hidden about it. 

note: I am NOT suggesting that Vox set anything up at the beginning. I'm suggesting that he jumped on the SP bandwagon, but pulled in a bunch of other voters to get himself and his publishing house a ton of nominations. </TEXT>

Well my understanding is that some SP and RP supporters did reach out to GG types, and there were a flood of new voters this year. So Larry himself may actively dislike GG and may have had nothing to do with it, but that doesn't mean that the Sad Puppies campaign overall didn't. 

It's like if GOP presidential nominee hates homophobic evangelical Christians, but the GOP supporters drive tons of them to vote... can you not say that the Republican party is associated with homophobic christians?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't like that either unless the ideology is currupting the work. Like, someone like Ayn Rand, to me at least, reads very poorly as fiction. Her characters are all flat and clear representations of her opponents, and then the characters that represent her viewpoint just go on 50 page lectures about the benefits of her philosophy. 

But if someone writers a great book, but outside of the work has bad opinions, I still read them. Hell, I love HP Lovecraft and he was a big racist.  </TEXT>

There are people who think that women should be nominated 50% of the time every year, etc. I think that's extreme... because the quality of work isn't constant (and probably 50% of SF writers aren't women) So I'm not one of those, but I do think that systematic bias exists and that when the nominees are almost always men or always white year after year, that's not a great sign.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I mean, I don't think there's a static number. Women are 50% of the population. Does that mean that women should be 50% of the nominees? Not necesssarily. If it was 30% one year, 40% the next, 25% the next, 60% after that... that seems right. 

But if it's 15% or less year after year after year it's a problem. 

So I dont' think it's about the numbers in a specific year, but over time.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I just have a hard time believing that's the case. Like, I'd be interested in an official survey of political beliefs over hugo nominees in the past 10 years. I doubt that there haven't been some conservatives. 

I definitely think the SP are 100% wrong when they claim that the Hugos have become "more liteary" and "less popular" and that their picks are the "popular" picks of fandom. It was posted in one of these threads, but the official bookscan sales numbers show the Sad Puppy authors doing worse in sales than the "literary" authors they decry.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You asked me:

 Follow up question, if we disallow writers from being nominated based off their skin color isn't that discrimination?

And I said I don't believe that. No one shoudl be "disallowed" because of any skin color. But... why are you asking that? no one is saying white people should be disallowed, nor are the hugos at risk of losing white nominees... they've been almost entirely white every year since the Hugo was founded. 

 What does their skin color have to do with the quality of their writing?

You are looking at it wrong. It's not that skin color determines quality, it's that a third of the US is non-white. The MAJORITY of the world is non-white. So if you are only nominating white people, that means you aren't really reading the breadth of literature out there.  </TEXT>

A) I don't think that "everyone who isn't a conservative Christian Anglo-American" is part of the same political disposition! There is a huge range of ideologies, political opinions, and stances outside of Christian UK/US conservatisim. So... I don't buy that the Hugos weren't diverse politically before, nor do I buy that the SP slate is politically diverse. 

b) Even having said the above, most Hugo nominees are not writing political fiction! And most probably aren't especially political themselves.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The Sad Puppies CLAIM their list is very diverse. I'm saying that's just a lie. It isn't diverse. 

Your other questions are much larger, but not something I'm addressing there. If the Sad Puppies want to say that their 90% male, nearly 100% white list represents the best fiction regardless of politics that's fine. We can debate that. But don't pretend the list is diverse because you put a few token women and non-whites on it.

I'm obviously not suggesting that white men be disallowed from nomination! That's a weird straw man. I think it's bad for a major award to be almost entirely white men, but I'm cerrtainly not saying there should be NO white men.  </TEXT>

https://bradrtorgersen.wordpress.com/2015/02/01/sad-puppies-3-the-2015-hugo-slate/

Best Novel: all white men

Best Novella: all white men

Best Novelette: all men, 4/5 white

etc. 

I only count 7 women (one listed twice) on their ENTIRE slate of 50+ names. 

If they want to say no one should think about gender or race or anything when voting, fine. But don't pretend that a list almost entirely made of up white American males has racial or gender diversity.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There's a bit of confusion about all this because there are three lists: The actual Hugo nominees, the Sad Puppies ballot, and the Rabid Pubbies ballot. 

I said that the actual nominees were largely conservative white men, with Wright getting six nominations and a brand new publishing house, run by Vox Day, getting 9. That's 100% true. 

The Rabid Puppies list was done by Vox Day, who is openly racist and was kicked out of the SFWA for calling a black author a "half-savage" and other things. His list was not diverse in the least. 

The Sad Puppies list was slightly more diverse... but only slightly. I think it's funny that the SP got EW to issue a correction, but we can actually judge the diversity for ourselves: 

https://bradrtorgersen.wordpress.com/2015/02/01/sad-puppies-3-the-2015-hugo-slate/

The Best Novel category is 5 white men. (Note: some people on reddit have been saying Correia is Latino. He's a white american of Portuguese descent)

Best Novella is 3 white men. 

Best Novellete is 4 white men and one non-white man. 

So... no, the Sad Puppies are not diverse. There isn't a single woman until the fourth category, and there are a only a handful of non-white authors on the whole list.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I hear you BUT what's funny/sad about all this is... the Hugos really haven't been that diverse. Like, just glancing at the last 10 of best novel winners it appears to be: 

10 white authors, 7 of which are men

100% white and 70% men is hardly affirmative action quota land. 

I'm also pretty positive the film and TV awards have been super white and male too. Granted, it's likely the case that the Hugos are more diverse than 100% whiteness if you get into some of the smaller awards like short story or novellete, but we are a LONG way away from racial quotas or non-white authors even being mathematically represented to their size of the population.

Basically, it seems like the Puppies are fighting a non-existent problem.  </TEXT>

Sure... but that's not what happened here. Vox Day and co went outside of the normal voters and got a bunch of new people to vote who most likely didn't read any of the books/works. (The voting numbers increased a bunch.)

It's not like there were some acclaimed big conservative books. Rather, a bunch of totally obscure books that didn't sell many copies got on because of outside voting to "fuck with the social justice warriors" </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I gotta question the idea that the Hugos have been completely dominated by "a single definable political skew." 

I can buy that the Hugos have maybe been slightly left leaning, but there is a HUGE swatch of ground between "social libertarian who is okay with gay marriage," "centrist Democrat" and the anarcho-anti-capitalism of like China Mieville. Like there are huge historic ideologies that fit in that range. 

I also think most of these writers that get nominated are not especially political. 

It seems like basically a lot of SF writers think there should be more gender balance and more racial diversity. That's not a horribly political stance... women make up half the population, and like 30%+ of americans are non-white.

	<TEXT> This is a great summary BUT you are missing a huge piece of the puzzle. 

This year Vox Day, an openly racist and sexist (talks about blacks as subhuman, advocates assaulting women) guy ran a "rabid puppy" slate full of 

A) openly racist or extreme right wingers

B) himself and his friends

(A and B completely overlap of course)

It was actually Vox Day's  slate that dominated the Hugo's not the Sad Puppy one. For example, Vox Day is on there twice, his author Wright is on there 6 times, and his publishing house is on there like 10 times. 

I imagine even Torgersen and Correia are embarrassed by Vox Day

 The Sad Puppies group say that it is odd that their motives are considered to be racism or conservatism, given that they recommended works by authors with diverse racial and political background.

Right, but what I said above is what everyone on both "sides" is missing. Correia and Torgersen's slate might have been pretty white and male, but at least somewhat diverse. But the Rabid Puppy slate was decidedly not. It was conservative, racist, and almost purely white. People are making a mistake conflating the Vox Day victory with Correia, but Correia and co are being silly pretending that the Hugo nominees aren't fully of extreme conservatives this year thanks to Rabid Puppies.  </TEXT>

So if the books are all great, the adaptations have a high bar to pass. 

There are some movies that are almost universally thought of as better though:

* The Godfather
* The Shining (okay this is debatable, but...)
* Psycho
* and so on

But that's not a great solution either. The point of awards, from my point of view, is to bring attention to fantastic work that may not have had great sales.

 push a progressive or preachy message in lieu of good storytelling

No one can read the SP slate stories and think they are against preachy storytelling. They just want preachy storytelling that preaches their POV

 Popular authors who didn't push a progressive message were being shut out of nominations.

The authors on the Sad Puppy slate are not popular, except Jim Butcher who likely would have been nominated anyway. Just factually, their books don't sell well: http://www.jasonsanford.com/blog/2015/4/yes-people-do-read-the-novels-up-for-the-hugo-and-nebula-awards </TEXT>

Not really in practice. In practice, everyone nominating different stories they truly loved means that small political voting blocs, like the Sad Puppies, can completely dominate. The actual solution is to have rival voting blocs so the SP can only get one or two noms on in each category, while the other voting blocs each get one or two as well. 

But, really, the solution is to change the voting system.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm just basing it on what the Sad Puppies themselves said: 

 while the big consumer world is at the theater gobbling up the latest Avengers movie, fandom is giving science fictions most prestigious award to stories and books that bore the crap out of the people at the theate

 Ill say it again: the Hugos (and the Nebulas too) have lost cachet, because at the same time SF/F has exploded popularly  with larger-than-life, exciting, entertaining franchises and products  the voting body of fandom have tended to go in the opposite direction: *niche*, academic, overtly to the Left in ideology and flavor, and ultimately lacking what might best be called visceral, gut-level, swashbuckling fun.

Those are just from one blog post from organizer Torgensen https://bradrtorgersen.wordpress.com/2015/01/16/why-sad-puppies-3-is-going-to-destroy-science-fiction/ but the Sad Puppies are always talking about how their "popular" fiction is being replaced by "niche" "literary" work. 

But looking at actually numbers, it's all a lie. The big literary Sf books that win awards outsell the nice Sad Puppy books. They are more popular, not less.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> How is saying "totally obscure?" addressing my point? 

I'm not misrepresenting the slate. The Sad Puppies claim to be defending the popular fiction that people actual read, the book versions of The Avengers film (their comparison), but instead they picked a bunch of obscure books. Station Eleven, Annihilation, even Ancillary Sword sold way more copies than the non-Butcher books they picked: 

http://www.jasonsanford.com/blog/2015/4/yes-people-do-read-the-novels-up-for-the-hugo-and-nebula-awards

and the the shorter awards are dominated by things like John C. Wright and  Castalia House? Just factually speaking, they are not very popular. Wright is a completely nobody next to Gaiman, Scalzi, Martin, or a dozen other people you could name off the top of your head. 

ETA: I'm not advocating for big name authors like King, Gaiman, and Martin to win every award. I'm only saying that the Sad Puppy slate does not represent the popular authors despite their claim.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  This is probably true. But the "Sad Puppies" also have a valid point that the more political nominations of the past weren't going to highly-read or especially good works, either.

but why counter that with... work that wasn't widely read or good but happens to share your viewpoint? 

If the Sad Puppies wanted to actually promote the most popular work, they should have had a best novel slate of Station Eleven, Annihilation, Skin Game, The Martian, and Lock In... or something like that. (Maybe California?) Anyway, only Skin Game was the only one they nominated that was actually popular.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  This would democratize the Hugo. It would make it, finally, a real fans' award. It would remove the gaming-the-system loophole that now exists due to low numbers of voters. Just, make the numbers of voters huge. Overwhelm all the factions. No lit faction, no sad anything, no political anything, just lots and lots of voters.

Is that much better though? In those kind of awards, it just goes to whatever book sold the most. Most people don't actually read many books, so there would only be a couple bestsellers who could even be in contention. And we don't need awards that recongize the bestseller list.... we can just look at the best seller list.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's never been this nakedly political before. There have always been groups, but the Sad Puppies voting bloc voted on a unified slate of mostly totally obscure white male authors. 

So instead of one or two surprises with, I guess, liberal politics getting on, you have literally entire categories entirely dominated by the Sad Puppy voting bloc. 

Politics aside, having basically a few people pick who gets nominated for most categories isn't a great way to do awards. I'd think it was gross if one or two liberal SF writers came out with the Politically Correct Slate and then the PC slate dominated every category.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah totally. Today there's tons of "serious" fairy tale inspired writers (Oyeyemi, Karen Russell, etc.). 10 years ago there were tons of genre benders (Chabon, Lethem, etc.) Before that there was Marquez and the Latin American magical realists. Before that there was the postmodernists who used magica elements (Coover, Barthelme). Before that there was Italo Calvino and the fabulists. Before that, Borges. 

etc. 

Magic in serious fiction is nothing new.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I wonder if the plot twist is just something he is trying to do to distinguish the books from the TV show, so that it can't be spoiled... rather than something that he'd write without a TV show over his head.  </TEXT>
