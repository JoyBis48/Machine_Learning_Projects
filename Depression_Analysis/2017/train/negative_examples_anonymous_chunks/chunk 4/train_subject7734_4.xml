	<TEXT> Saturday while I was on the highway all of a sudden my truck slipped out of gear revving the hell out of my engine. Now, It wont work in D or R. 1st and second still work manually. They kind of go into D and R and feels like it starts to go but not really. It moves a tiny bit.
I went and pulled the codes

P0735

P1270

B1600

P0171

None of this looks good.
In have had a strange electrical issue for a while. Says door is ajar when its not, engine light go on and off, blinker is sparatic and makes a gritty noise half the time. After all this went down now the blinker works absolutely perfect while it hasn't since I've owned it.
Anyone advice on where I should start besides of course bringing it the shop. Im going crazy not knowing and nobody is around until tomorrow. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Last week redditgifts sent us mods a message informing us that a user would be posting clues to the secret box in this subreddit, and to keep it a secret. 

It somehow ended up in /r/hartford. Nothing against /r/hartford (they are a fine upstanding subreddit) but they have about 8,000 less subscribers. 

To ensure that the rest of connecticut gets to partake in this I am doing my own. 

**THE SUPER DUPER SECRET SCAVENGER HUNT THING**

To keep it relevant and not lose steam I am having it this Sunday (11/23). Be sure to keep your eyes peeled to /r/connecticut Sunday at around 8AM for the riddles/clues/etc.

The first clue will point towards the general area of the state and the next clue will be given after there is ample time for anyone from any corner of the state to make it to that area...ensuring everyone can get in on it.

I promise the box won't suck. </TEXT>

1. Garageband
2. Magellan
3. DM1
4. Funkbox
5. MusicStudio 2
6. Loopy HD

What I am wondering is what should I get for an audio interface and vocal/acoustic guitar mic? Thinking of getting a mixer for the acoustic drum recording. (want to make sure what I get is compatible)

I am going to use my bestbuy credit card to get the interface and mic. 

Whats my best bet guys/gals?

Thank you. :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I just had a nightmare last night (not something I normally have) that I watched a friend from high school get mauled by a grizzly.


I haven't seen this kid in 20 years. I've never seen a bear in real life. 

In the dream I was hanging out with a bunch of friends from high school (in high school times) and there happened to be a bunch of bears around. We all notice one that snuck up on us. I bolted for the car and got in along with a few of my other friends. My other friend, Dan didn't make it and I watched him get torn apart by this bear right up against the car.


I woke up as the bear had begun prying/tearing the door apart next to me. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> [Here are my stats](http://www.rundouble.com/user/fb:604245161/E4jLy5cB)

W2D1 was very rewarding and fairly easy. Today was a beast. I may be getting shin splints, I'm not sure. The pain was almost unbearable. Also, all of the other days I felt really good and after each workout and even sometimes got that extra burst of energy. Today afterwards I really hurt, felt exhausted and almost sick to my stomach. What am I doing wrong? I stretch before each workout. Maybe not enough? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> I am 36, soon to be 37. I just recently attended Beck's Providence show. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-08-04 06:02:26 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I have for many years claimed he is my favorite musician/songwriter. I was introduced to him through a friend who got some shit from some skater magazine back in early high school. That is where it began. 

Long story short...it stuck.

This last show in Providence was the first time I saw him perform in over 10 years. Life just happens. We miss simple things. This performance reminded me to never let them slip by. I don't mean just Beck but any band/musician you are into. Just make it fucking happen. 

I had such a blast, enjoyed every minute of the show and just became  even more of a fan of his catalogue. 

Side note. I became a musician because of Beck and now that i have settled down and have some stability in my ,life I am slowly gathering equipment again to produce.  </TEXT>
