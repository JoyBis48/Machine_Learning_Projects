	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> We will continue to ignore political and economic forecasts, which are an expensive
distraction for many investors and businessmen. **Thirty years ago, no one could have
foreseen the huge expansion of the Vietnam War**, wage and price controls, two oil
shocks, the resignation of a president, the dissolution of the Soviet Union, a one-day drop
in the Dow of 508 points, or treasury bill yields fluctuating between 2.8% and 17.4%.

**But, surprise - none of these blockbuster events made the slightest dent in Ben
Graham's investment principles. Nor did they render unsound the negotiated
purchases of fine businesses at sensible prices.** Imagine the cost to us, then, if we had
let a fear of unknowns cause us to defer or alter the deployment of capital. Indeed, we
have usually made our best purchases when apprehensions about some macro event were
at a peak. Fear is the foe of the faddist, but the friend of the fundamentalist.   ^([emphasis added]) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Since the purpose of the CFS is to act as a check on the income statement, just look for anything which might indicate manipulation via timing of cash flows. e.g. unusual investments, refinancing patterns, funding dividends from loans, etc. It's also useful to pick out any abnormally large adjustments. Stuff which skip the income statement and go straight to the balance sheet are also red flags, like unsustainable principal repayments. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm going to explain this from the perspective of the income statement, but it should help you understand the cash flow statement as well. 

When a company earns cash, it goes into its wallet. Now if this were a 'project' instead of a 'company', the cash earned would immediately exit the sphere of the 'project' and go straight to the 'owners'. Thus the cash earned attributed to the project is obvious. 

However, a company might choose to retain the cash and reinvest it into a second project instead of giving it back. Now this is a large investment which drains your cash. When investors look at this, it has the wrong effect of attributing your empty cash balance to dismal performance of the first project - when in fact it did very well.  So to record actual performance, you match the expense against the revenues of the appropriate timeframe, i.e. future revenues and not past revenues. This is the concept of the income statement. 

However, companies are not static entities; they're constantly in a state of flux. The moment more cash comes in, they reinvest it. Thus it becomes exceedingly important to maintain a record of past performance (i.e. past cash flows earned attributed to past operations), so that past performance is correctly attributed to past operations. This is the net profit amount, and is accumulated in the retained earnings figure. 

This also has the great advantage of allowing more complex cash movements like loans, receivables etc. Basically, divorcing the actual cash flows from performance allowed companies to delay or speed up their expenses, which facilitated the liquidity of money itself. We would later recognize this as "float". 

That's why in the beginning, the SEC only required income statements and not cash flow statements; because given enough time, the cash flow statement eventually catches up to the income statement. The cash flow statement was therefore effectively redundant for making long term decisions. 

The problem arose when companies started to take advantage of this divorce from cash flows to manipulate earnings. For instance, constantly refinancing at higher and higher rates until the Ponzi scheme collapsed. Basically, the authorities realized that only allowing investors to observe the tip of the pyramid - and not the base on which it rests - allowed management to hide stuff for a long time before reality caught up. This was why the SEC reintroduced the cash flow statement - to provide a check and balance against the income statement which was built on top of it. 

Remember, the income statement merely matches cash flows across time; so in perpetuity both eventually converge. Thus, even though the cash flow statement was redundant for long term purposes, it made apparent the steps which were taken to arrive at the income statement. So that when the time comes to realize the retained earnings amount, the cash will be there.

	<TEXT> Of more practical importance is the question whether or not investment
can be successfully carried on in common stocks that appear cheap
from the quantitative angle and thatupon studyseem to have average
prospects for the future. Securities of this type can be found in reasonable
abundance, as a result of the stock markets obsession with companies considered
to have unusually good prospects of growth. Because of this emphasis
on the growth factor, quite a number of enterprises that are long
established, well financed, important in their industries and presumably
destined to stay in business and make profits indefinitely in the future, but
that have no speculative or growth appeal, tend to be discriminated against
by the stock marketespecially in years of subnormal profitsand to ***sell
for considerably less than the business would be worth to a private owner***.


Note that we have applied the touchstone of value to a private investor to justify two different
types of *investment* in common stocks: 

(1) purchase of issues thought to have exceptional
prospects at no higher price than would be paid for a corresponding interest in a private business,
and 

(2) purchase of issues with good records and average prospects at a much lower price
than the business is worth to a private owner. 

See Appendix Note 45, p. 778 on accompanying
CD, for the exhibit of an issue of the latter type (Swift and Company).

They're bigger versions of the batteries that power your iPad, but for your house. Many ugly old men have been selling the exact same thing since the dinosaurs died, but because they were ugly no one wants to buy them. Now this nice handsome man is wrapping a shiny wrapper around them and your daddy can't come home because he's working so hard to buy one. 

But here's a secret: this handsome young man doesn't really care about selling you the battery so you can store power for your house in it. He just wants to sell more of it so they become cheaper because he's selling so many of them. Then he can reduce the price of his gigantic toy cars which are powered by those same batteries, so one day your daddy can buy one. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> The new-era investment theory was conspicuously reticent on the mathematical side. The
relationship between price and earnings, or price and trend of earnings was anything that
the market pleased to make it (note the price of Electric Power and Light compared with its
earnings record given on p. 363). If an attempt were to be made to give a mathematical
expression to the underlying idea of valuation, ***it might be said that it was based on the***
**derivative** ***of the earnings, stated in terms of time***. In recent years more serious efforts have
been made to establish a mathematical basis for discounting expected future earnings or dividends.
See Gabriel Preinreich, The Theory of Dividends, New York, 1935; and J. B. Williams,
The Theory of Investment Value, Cambridge, Mass., 1938. The latter work is built on the
premise that the value of a common stock is equal to the present value of all future dividends.
This principle gives rise to an elaborate series of mathematical equations designed to
calculate exactly what a common stock is worth, assuming certain vital facts about future
earnings, distribution policy and interest rates. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That is all good and fair, and if they are applying conservative accounting policies by immediately expensing R D then I commend their professionalism. But if that's true then the bigger problem is why are they expensing so much of it? R D can only be capitalized when there is a reasonable expectation that it will eventually yield profits - so if they are expensing nonessentials at this order of magnitude, you really have to wonder whether they are allocating capital wisely. 

In fact, if I were to give you the benefit of the doubt and accept this as truth, it might be even worse - since it signals that they are desperately trying to come up with something new, which could mean they *know* that their current position is unsustainable. Which is simply dumping water out of a leaking boat. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Actually I took a cursory look at their 2013 financial statements. It seems that the reason for their losses are twofold: firstly gross margins are very low, which is fine; but they also have very high administrative expenses which eat up everything left. I dug into it and found that two aspects were the leading causes: Sales   Fulfillment. Sales is the commissions etc. to bring revenues, while Fulfillment refers to affiliates-related activity. There is no further drill-down analysis.

Now, the main argument for Amazon actually being wildly profitable if they stopped reinvesting is that the cash flows are being "sunk" into CAPEX, right? Since the bulk of SG A are Sales and Fulfillment, the increase in net profit if they stop reinvesting will have to come from either of these. I did a little more research into what Sales and Fulfillment means. Sales apparently is quite straightforward - commissions etc, so there's little room for interpretation there. But Fulfillment is a little trickier - they mostly relate to warehouse activity. As the cost of building new warehouses and scaling their SaaS segment makes up most of their reinvestments, these "sunk" cash flows are being attributed to Fulfillment expenses. 

But remember that CAPEX does not flow through the income statement - it goes straight to the balance sheet and is reflected as depreciation/amortization, and is insignificant compared to both Sales and Fulfillment. So Fulfillment expenses on the income statement doesn't actually relate to reinvesting activity, but rather the ancillary costs of building new warehouses, e.g. hiring more people, or paying for rights to inventory. Or they could just as well be amortization of Goodwill from their robust acquisition spree, like the impressive Kiva robots. In any case, this means that Fulfillment expenses do not actually go down when reinvestment stops - they simply stop scaling up. Thus, the net profit figure that you see now is the actual future free cash flow if they simply stopped investing today. 

The point I'm trying to make is that I do not see how the argument that they would be profitable if they stopped reinvesting makes sense. The income statement matches cash flows across time, so it reflects how future cash flows will look like assuming Amazon remains as a going concern. Which means that cash flows will eventually catch up with profits; which means future cash flows = net profit. Which is bad news for Amazon. Cash flows may appear strong today, but that is just "float" which has to eventually be absorbed by future outflows. 

edit - Tl;dr: Amazon is not sinking money into future growth. It is sinking money into upkeep of past growth activity, which is correctly reflected as expenses. Therefore the net profit figure IS the correct amount of free cash flow. Unless I'm missing something else, the net profit/retained earnings figure is all the future cash shareholders will enjoy from present day business. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  One of the great mysteries of today's market is the way Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock trades at such a huge discount to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock. In terms of price-to-earnings, Apple trades at a forward 2012 P/E of 12, while Amazon trades at a forward 2012 P/E of 193. This happens despite Apple growing revenues faster than Amazon, growing earnings, and growing estimates. Amazon not only has revenues that grow slower, but its earnings have been falling for two years straight. Amazon's earnings are also predicted to fall in 2012 vs. 2011, and its next-quarter earnings are predicted to fall 95% from the year before. Finally, Amazon's EPS estimates for the next quarter were slashed 90% just days ago.

 Knowing this, it's hard to understand how Amazon can not only trade at a premium to Apple, but indeed trade at an earnings valuation multiple that is a full 16 times larger than Apple's. To put things into perspective, if Apple traded at Amazon's earnings multiple, it would trade at $9,000. Or if Amazon traded at Apple's multiple, it would trade for just $14.16.

So is there any explanation for this absurd disconnect? Yes, there might be one. </TEXT>
