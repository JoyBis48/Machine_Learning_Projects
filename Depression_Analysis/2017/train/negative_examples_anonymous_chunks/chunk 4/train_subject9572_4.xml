	<TEXT> Estes FTW!  I had many enjoyable launches and (more than I would like to admit) crashes using Estes rockets. The real crowd pleaser during my 7th grade rocket club was my Estes Saturn V rocket with 4 engines.  Unfortunately only two engines ignited, and even more unfortunately the ones that ignited were not diagonally opposed but adjacent engines.  The result was a launch that went from vertical to horizontal then started dipping downward, ending with a parachute ejection into the ground.  I will not forget the applause to this day and that was 44 years ago.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> After a little reading it appears the most currently favored cosmological model for the universe's expansion is the Lambda-CDM model where Cold Dark Matter and Dark Energy dominate the energy-density of our universe (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda-CDM_model). This model appears to support observations that our universe's expansion is accelerating, although I can't determine what the model predicts for the end state of the universe, but it does not support a Big Rip as you indicated.  However, if the acceleration of the universe's expansion is left unchecked, it would appear the Lambda-CDM theory model is inconsistent with the theory proposed by Dr. Padilla and the resulting Big Crunch.  Am I missing something here? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I thought it was an interesting theory, but I'm dubious. The theory Dr. Padilla describes directly contradicts the generally accepted theory that the universe's expansion is accelerating and the end result will be a Big Rip (where even subatomic particles are torn apart due to the expansion of space) rather than a Big Crunch. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is a result of particle/wave duality.  Quantum theory says that energy carried by a field (or wave) can be broken down no further than its quantum component.  In other words, all fields have a corresponding minimum energy particle and vice versa.  It's like the difference between the electromagnetic field and the photon.  They're the same but exhibit field (wave) behavior or particle behavior depending on how they are observed. </TEXT>
