	<TEXT> I agree to a point.  It is tough though because there are too many people out there that will like the bad guys no matter what and will not boo.  But yes, there needs to be a resurgence in the amount of heel tactics in matches like eye raking/gouging, cheap shots, low blows, etc. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In essence yes, you are giving them a reaction.  But, there is still a fundamental difference between booing and cheering.  Booing shows your disdain for a wrestler while cheering shows your support. For example, if Barrett is facing Neville and he hits him with a Bull Hammer, he should not get a standing ovation.  He should get a rousing chorus of boos because he is the bad guy. </TEXT>
