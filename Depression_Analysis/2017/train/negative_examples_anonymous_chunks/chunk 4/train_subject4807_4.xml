	<DATE> 2015-04-22 20:11:55 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Columbus residents are fortunate to have curbside recycling -- but how well are we doing it? I thought I was being good by saving even scraps of clean cardboard and paper, washing out food containers before putting them in the bin, etc. But then I saw that a friend is saving every plastic bag (although I don't know where she plans to take it), and now I wonder. Do you 

-- empty and wash jars at the back of the refrigerator with contents that have turned into slimy science experiments?
-- tear apart pizza boxes to save the clean cardboard?  
-- refuse styrofoam takeout containers?  
-- use only cloth kitchen towels, rather than paper?  

Bonus question:
Do you urge your friends and relatives to work harder at recycling?

And of course:
Why or why not? </TEXT>

May other pollworkers here also find themselves facing such an embarrassment of riches! </TEXT>

If there's a [dead skunk in the middle of the road](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uu5hzc2Mei4) just west of Linworth, I'm afraid that's my fault. It just came out of nowhere. Take care that no animal, car or pedestrian does that to you this morning! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No kidding: dozens of volunteer organizers have been trudging through this rottten weather for months now, preparing the groundwork for three days of fun in the sun together at Community Festival next June. Now it's your turn.

[Applications are online for performers and workshop presenters](https://www.comfest.com/perform/signup.cgi), so nudge your favorite local band to apply soon. Ideas for workshops are especially timely: send these to lithag(at)aol.com with a subject line "ComFest workshop idea". 

[Street Fair Vendor applications are also now online.](http://www.comfest.com/street-fair-vendors.php) Categories in this juried fair include community organizations, arts   crafts, global village, contemporary commercial, and food. 

[Sign-up  for onsite volunteers is already live online](https://www.comfest.com/volunteer/signup.cgi) to help run central Ohio's all-time favorite festival. Whether your thing is pouring beer, wrangling band equipment, recycling or helping visitors find their way around, be sure to get in your request early to get the shift you want. 

And believe it or not, [the Logo Contest is just two weeks away -- March 5](http://www.comfest.com/logo-contest.php) at the Shelterhouse in Goodale Park. If you have an idea but aren't a great artist, try a collaboration with someone who is.

And as always, the [General Planning Meetings are open to all.](http://www.comfest.com/calendar.php) So if you're interested in building this volunteer-run, [mission-driven](http://www.comfest.com/purpose.php) work, c'mon down and introduce yourself! There's plenty to do, and lots of good people to work with to get it done.
