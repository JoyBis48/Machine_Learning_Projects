[$31.24 @ APMEX](http://www.apmex.com/product/85992/2015-rwanda-1-oz-silver-african-buffalo)

Playing around with various counts:

* $544.85 for 20 @ Gainesville, this is with my rapey quoted USPS shipping of $19.45!
* $585.00 for 20 @ APMEX with free shipping

If you're looking for this coin, might want to take a look at Gainesville.

* They need to move inventory, that's the business they're in.
* They have sales, this part of the prior bullet point.
* You don't know what they paid for it.
* It may be a loss leader, i.e., it gets people to their site (new/recurring) where they buy other shit that has a bigger profit margin.
* Their sales have no effect on spot price, they would have to move massive amounts onto the market to have any impact on spot price.
* They are no doubt massively hedged. Spot could go down, sales could go down, but they could conceivable make more $ because they're hedged (they make the $ up elsewhere).
* APMEX has more Illuminati reptilians in shipping/receiving than in management. There is no conspiracy here until The Super Blood Moon Shemitah happens this September 23rd, thus the sign of Gozer's coming. WAKE UP!!! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They do not.

Sometimes price differences between the two sites are negligible (even with shipping charge), sometimes they're quite surprising. I usually load up carts between those two with the same items and then start whittling them down based on respective prices. Well, actually I do that across all my regular vendors. Instead of one order with one vendor I can end up with 2 or 3 separate orders with 2 or 3 separate vendors.  There is $ to be saved this way.

As always, you should do some price comparison before ordering.  </TEXT>

Bears are very smart and have been known to roll rocks into bear traps to set off the trap and eat the bait in safety. Smart like the legal team at Dewey Cheatum   Howe, LLP.

Canoeists have to keep their centre of mass low, so they dont capsize the canoe. Same strategy can be applied to tort law.

	<TEXT> Impressive collection.

For cost he says he's in for everything on a per oz basis of $34.21. I'd be more curious as to what each year cost, not everything averaged out.

Also says total oz is 461.4 so he's all in for **$15,784**. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I recently placed an order and it was $hipped out UPS, which really sucks for me as it's a 20+ mile trip (one way) to go pick it up. And I live in a major metro area....And of course you don't find out your carrier until you get the tracking number.

I wonder if UPS is their exclusive carrier now. That would definitely be a show stopper for me as saving $20 on an order isn't worth the inconvenience of UPS. I doubt I'd ever save enough to make it worth my while. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> One thing you need to keep in mind is the percentage change in silver to the percentage change in gold (per metric ton squared), when the latter has a causal influence on the former.

Think of silver spot price given in terms of differential calculus. In other words, it is a tool for measuring the responsiveness of one variable to changes in another, causative variable (silver to gold). Silver has the advantage of being a unitless ratio (excluding the troy ounce), independent of the type of quantities being varied. 

In empirical work regarding silver forecasting, you'll find the lows are the estimated coefficient in a linear regression equation where both the dependent variable and the independent variable are in natural logs.

You also need to factor in the percentage change in silver output induced by a percent change in silver input. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> What's the easiest way to file my federal and state taxes online? H R Block seems to have best reviews </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-02-23 22:38:11 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I have pretty simple taxes:

* W2 wages
* Mortgage insurance
* 1099 misc income (from interest)
* No Obamacare
* No kids or any other deductions - as I said, pretty simple taxes

I've been going to a local guy for years but I'd like to save some $ and do them myself. He charges me around $100.

TurboTax and H R Block look to be the big players out there.  From my limited research, H R Block seems to get better reviews.  It looks like their Deluxe + State would be the best for me.

Some questions I have for those who have filed your own taxes online:

* Do I need to get electronic copies of my W2, mortgage insurance and 1099 that get sent along with my e-filing?
* If I need to print out forms, does something like H R Block Deluxe let you save those out to PDFs for printing? I don't have a printer at home so would want to be able to print it out at work. For example, if I have to pay state taxes, I don't want to pay to e-file that, I'd want to print out and mail my state return.

Any hidden gotchas I should be aware of?  I would have nothing to import from previous years, so this would be brand new tax filing for me. </TEXT>

http://www.apmex.com/faq

*How is my order shipped?
*American Precious Metals Exchange orders are shipped Registered/Insured U.S. Mail,   UPS. Each package is fully insured and may require a signature upon delivery.*

The "may require a signature" is probably determined by your order amount, which they could verify.

You could also be seeing a bug on USPS' tracking display.  If APMEX confirms they were sent with signature confirmation, it sounds like you have a problem with your postal carrier. In which case you'd at least know where the breakdown occurred and where to go to get it resolved in the future. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> **I would steer clear of goldmart.**  I've ordered from them once.  **Once**...I really think they sell what they don't have in stock (like Amagi), despite claiming they have it "in stock, ready to ship".  I also think they drop ship orders because when my order finally arrived, it was covered in multi-colored stamps.  [Imagine this, but literally covered in different colorful stamps](http://www.sandafayre.com/stockimages/26343163.jpg).  It really screamed unprofessional to me, but maybe that wouldn't bother anyone else.  I really wish I would have taken a picture of it to post whenever I share my goldmart experience.

Goldmart was the lowest price I found, but I will never do business with them again.

[Silver.com is 40 cents more per coin](http://www.silver.com/2015-1-oz-silver-canadian-maple-leafs/) and I can't recommend them enough.  They're the same folks as JM Bullion.  They're awesome. Silver.com is the cheapest I found doing some quick price comparisons. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There are a couple with some tiny dings, but I don't really care as they're generic and they were like 10 cents over spot.  The tube ran me $340.01. Hard to say no to that, IMO. 

One had what almost looked like a diagonal score line across the back.  I'll try to get some photos up tonight, though sadly my camera isn't the greatest.  They'll go off to the safe deposit box Monday so if I can't get good quality photos tonight, the photos ain't happening :(

They look fine to me, again, generics, don't really care!

[**Photos of by far the worst two**](http://imgur.com/a/orgQl) and it sounds dumb, but they actually look worse in the photos than in person. Being generic as generic gets, doesn't bother me at all.  It's hard to photograph coins with my crappy camera....Subject matter is highly reflective, don't have the best lighting, camera macro isn't the greatest and the auto focus tends to do its own thing, sometimes half is in focus, half a little blurry. </TEXT>

Just got home from work Monday pm and there was a delivery attempt notification. This was literally coast-to-coast shipping as well. I wasn't expecting anything before like Wednesday, tracked the ebay shipping # to make sure it was the ASEs and the delivery attempt was indeed the ASEs.

I've only purchased from them 2x (both via ebay, both ASEs tube sales) and this purchase is absolutely bananas!
