Sure not not all games were available, but the selection they did have wasn't exactly subpar either.

If you didn't like the PSPGO you either didn't have one or never took advantage of all its features.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Eh, I bought it at launch based on what they were advertising / hyping and that was a handheld that plays games that rival that on the PS3.

Games like Uncharted, Wipeout, Gravity Rush. As well as the announcement of titles like Bioshock, Warriors Lair etc. And showing the tech demo of MGS4 touting how easy they could scale back games to port across... which was pure hype to garner sales and line their pockets. 

These are hardly anime/jprg titles that plague the handheld market... But they are what we now have because Sony fucken bailed shortly after release and did nothing to push western developers to continue working on the Vita and burning bridges with the ones that wanted to.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Fuck that noise, that may be fine for some / you.
I play my PS4 when I'm at home and I can wait 5-10 minutes to go take a shit 
without the need to pick up a Vita to continue my gaming session on the throne.

Myself and allot of other people bought the Vita because it was sold to us as a "portable console". Ya know, to play games on the go, not at home.

But where are those portable console quality games now? Far and few between. 

Where are the shovelware / indie titles?  Fucken everywhere... Not too mention they have already been on every device. I dont want to spend $15 on a game I played 2 years ago on my toaster. I'd rather spend $40 for a portable Resident Evil, Infamous or a new damn IP... 

My Vita has been gathering dust for some time and thats even after risking purchases on the slew of Anime/JPRG schlock thats prevalent on the Vita just for something new to play.

But hey I guess I should be grateful that Sony allows me to play PS4 games remotely all the while passing them off as Vita exclusives right?

	<TEXT> Yeah it came part of a bundle, but not the Left Behind DLC. 

It was The Grounded Bundle and it was for multiplayer maps, perks and weapons, not single player related at all. 

They also sold it stand alone at $4.99 USD. (Seems like the price went up, it's now $7.55)

I mean cool, It's nice they sorta threw it in along with multiplayer DLC and gave other people the option if they want it or not... 

But again they are charging for a level of difficulty, something they could just patch in.  

Let the circle jerk continue I guess?

transparent backgrounds / pngs a few updates ago, it no longer does that weird flashing thing when you change screens. 

So you can have a background like yours with the flowing background color of your choice instead of a pain black.

	<TEXT> Serious question, what the hell is up with the current trend of releasing "teasers" for a trailer of an upcoming movie? 

"Oh hey, you know that movie you know is coming out? Well here's a teaser trailer that the actual trailer will be out soon..."

What's next? They're going to do a press conference to announce an upcoming teaser of a teaser of the trailer for their movie... Why not just skip the bullshit and just release the trailer...?

It seems people care more about the hype and publicity surrounding movies / entertainment than the final product these days.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I love players like you, you guys give me something to do outside of the jobs. 

I hunt you guys down using the same tactics, sometimes inviting friends along for the fun griefing players like yourself. That's until you either rage quit or finally get bored of dying within seconds of spawning and leave the server. 

I hope we cross paths sometime, I think we'd have fun.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It can play Vita games, PSX games, PSP games and remote play PS4 games. So it has a decent library.

It's not actually a bad little device,  it's just that the memory for it is way too expensive, the native Vita games library is very JRPG heavy with little else available. 

It's not something you'd buy without research... otherwise you'd be somewhat disappointed.  </TEXT>
