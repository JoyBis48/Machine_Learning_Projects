	<TEXT> Well, looks like I've got some reading to do. I agree with you in the functioning of militaries in the modern world, as well. Sadly, armed forces are more often sink pits for surplus population and wealth that could be much better used in much better pursuits. This is not unique to the DPRK. The US does it, most European nations do it. Sure, there's military actions in these states, but it's often to the ends of amoral puppet masters and not to the ends of the national interest. Rather like the DPRK, though in a grander scale and different guise. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Absolutely. For example, I'm sure that whoever founded Nestle had no idea they'd become the amoral bastards they are today. I'm sure that the founders of the Republican and Democratic parties had no idea they'd allow America to become what it is today. And I am abundantly certain that the old Bolsheviks came to rue what became of their revolution. Movements can certainly lead quite far from where they're intended to go. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I can understand the moral side to this, but from a practical perspective, the North Korean military isn't a fighting force. It's a social institution which rarely wields martial power as it knows that any sort of war they fight is a losing proposition. Instead, it's an internal control mechanism which exists to scare people into line and run camps. I highly doubt that 16 year olds are given rifles and told to shoot people. More likely, they're learning to shoot and parade around and basically nothing more.

Further, the military is likely the best route most North Koreans have for getting regular meals. To say nothing of medical care and possible opportunities for education and social advancement within the wretched *Songbun* system that military service affords. 

So, while I abhor the DPRK regime, letting 16 year olds into the North Korean military is acceptable.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The Philippines has a claim on the islands there too. If it was still part of the US, that means the American Navy would be there to enforce those claims.

I agree entirely. However, we could also look for the Communist Chinese to build a much stronger navy. The [PLAN](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Liberation_Army_Navy) has, until recently, been something of a red headed step child amongst the Chinese armed forces. Naturally, the Military Commission had been rather keen on the advantages of a true blue water navy for some time, but until very recently the technical expertise and vast resources necessary to create and maintain such a force had eluded them. 

However, in the past twenty years, China's economy has exploded and (coupled with the opening up of former Soviet technical expertise) the Chinese have been able to acquire the backbone of a true blue water fleet. Where once they had been able to field a token submarine force, they're now able to field carriers and light cruisers. 

Now, back to the What If. One imagines that with a US territory not too far off and their Nationalist rivals licking their wounds on Taiwan, Mao might look at a Navy as a much more vital asset. The Communists might even have looked to their friendship with the Soviets in a more careful light and worked harder to placate Khrushchev in an effort to avoid the Sino-Soviet split, thus ensuring that Soviet naval power (which was far from inconsiderable) would come into play in the West Pacific. This is all highly speculative, naturally, but the naval situation alone could pose for scores of HistoryWhatIfs. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Underwater, you mean? Andrew Ryan was an incredibly successful businessman topside. In a museum located at Ryan Amusements, the story of the voyage (and subsequent refitting for ocean floor construction) of Ryan's private ocean liner The Olympian is detailed, along with the hard work of Ryan's private army of laborers. These laborers were given places in Rapture for their trouble (and, one assumes, to preserve Rapture's secrecy) but were forced to settle in the maintenance tunnels beneath the Atlantic Express rail lines, now known as Pauper's Drop.

In other words, a lot of the Family Splicers that Delta murdered there are the men who built Rapture. Thanks, Delta. Jackass. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Rapture employed a system of fog emitting shrouds to keep people from finding the lighthouse which served as its entrance. Of course, during the initial startup phase, there were problems: mass dieoffs of fisheries, oil slicks, and the like. However, as Rapture's defensive systems (torpedoes, mines, inferred anti-air capabilities) resulted in disappearances of shipping and aircraft that remained unexplained to the wider world - coupled with the extremely inhospitable nature of the frigid North Atlantic meant that a large swatch of sea was left quite avoided: cursed to the superstitious and commercially dead to the rational.

As it was never a particularly well travelled region of ocean in the first place, nobody really felt the loss for this and, by design, Andrew Ryan's shining utopia achieved perfect isolation from the outside world... barring the errant daredevil diver or a domestic situation that would make Jerry Springer gasp. Otherwise, Rapture marches on. </TEXT>

For these reasons, the Communist party is not without its supporters.

Not sure why communist is used as though it's a bad thing. Ever read Marx? Communism is, at its heart, a very good and benevolent philosophy - much moreso than capitalism.

	<DATE> 2015-01-14 03:34:43 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Basically, I have a shitload of obscure music from the Communist world of varying vintages, a level of skill at writing stiffly propagandistic radio copy, and a degree of experience with voice work. What I'd love to do is make a radio station for either FNV or FO3 that broadcasts as a service of the irradiated ghouls shambling around in the old Soviet embassy.

If this sounds like something you'd like to be a part of, let me know. I really only need someone with enough GECK know how to make all the audio that I level and produce to come out fine in the script and in game. As I have no plans to make any in game content, it should be a modest undertaking at its most difficult.

If such a mod already exists, I apologize for the seeming redundancy, but I'd dare to venture that my effort would make a worthy and immersive addition to any play through of either game.


UPDATE

I've recorded several DJ quips and have a nearly finalized selection of tracks I'm putting in. This is subject to change, and if you have any suggestions feel free to speak up. Chances are that I probably have it.

**Soviet:**

My Army

There, Far Beyond the River

If You'll Be Lucky

Lenin is Young Again

On the Hills of Manchuria

Russian Sailors Dance

Pesnaya

Lenin is Always With You

War Century

Na Strazi Mira

Anebopok

The Rockets Are Always Ready!

Ne Plach Devchonka

Kiev Waltz



**Chinese:**

When That Day Comes

Chen Sisi: My Dear Chinese People

When The Motherland Calls Upon Us

The East Is Red

Socialism is Good!

Unknown Mao Zedong Red Opera



**East German:**

Ernst Busch: The Left March

Erich Weinert Ensemble: Spartakus In Berlin


**North Korean:**

The General Is Seen at the Outpost

Don't Ask My Name

We Will Follow You Forever

Korea Does What It is Determined to Do

Footsteps

Where Are You, Dear General?


**Hungarian:**

A Parttal A Neppel

This list is very much in flux and open to suggestion. I may add or remove things in order to create the right tone for the station. Additionally, if you have requests for things you want to hear the DJ talk about and put a commie spin on, feel free to suggest them here. 

**Preview**

A preview of the mod is located [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkC6gsMCLzY)


**UPDATE 01/15**

Principal recording of DJ lines is complete. Track listing is complete. All that remains is placing and some audio post-production. I'm quite pleased with how everything has come together, and I'm pretty sure it even plays nice with canon and lore. I'll make another post once the whole thing is done, and I hope you all enjoy it.

To celebrate this milestone, [here](http://vocaroo.com/i/s1wZJvPoQRxa) is another preview of the DJ copy.

	<TITLE> Cockney people: the tragic, untold story </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-12-02 20:32:49 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Britain's cockney culture is characterized by a charming accent that is famous the world round for evoking images of chimney sweeps and Dickensian orphans. HOWEVER, there is an untold tragedy behind this distinctive brogue.

You see, the cockney tradition of calling strangers 'guvna' does not, in point of fact, stem from rhyming slang and the archaic term 'scrivener.' In fact, all cockney people suffer from a terrible and debilitating condition that leaves them unable to properly identify the current governor. Therefore, in a mixture of respect and a fear of terrifyingly draconian British laws regarding the failure to pay proper deference to government officials, cockneys are left with but one recourse:

Greet everyone as 'guvna.' </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For all those currently relying on Skype and the like: hang in there! It gets better! My girlfriend and I met online and the day we met each other was the happiest day of our lives. We've been living together for over two years now, but we still look back to our days of falling asleep on Skype and chatting online fondly. Hang in there. You'll be together some day, and let me tell you: there's nothing more rewarding than that final visit to the airport.  </TEXT>
