	<TEXT> When I ask for a nickel-free earring because I noticed that nickel causes a rash and inflammation on my ear, no one hysterically accuses me of being "anti-earring". When you are evaluating the messages here, which you must do for the sake of your child's health, think about this:


--98% of people who want to get thimerasol out of vaccines are NOT "Anti-Vaccine" they want vaccines to be safer


--And yet, you will notice that there are hysterical straw men arguments made accusing people who want safer vaccines to be 'anti-vaccine'.
Start there. Why would ANYONE slam the parent of an autistic or brain-injured child and misrepresent their story and their wish unless they had an either religious fervor about vaccines or a financial interest or a desparate wish to hide the truth? If they are really concerned that people will stop vaccinating if they learn that vaccines have dangerous ingredients, then why not join us in making vaccines safer? There is no explanation for their rabid denial that poisons in vaccines are not a good idea, and their continual misrepresenation of this. Excpet a desparate wish to avoid blame or financial loss. Or simply a desparate wish to be correct.

 But what motivates parents of vaccine injured children and environmentalists like RFK Jr? Common sense and dozens of studies you can find in his book. And a wish to never see another babbling child anywhere in the world, become silent, as so many parents of mercury -poisoned have. It's a poison. Its in vaccines. Get it out! Enough said!!!! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Indeed, despite the often-decried undercurrent of Social Darwinism in Heinlein's science fiction, there also exists a significant dallying with transnational political organizations. Heinlein's idealism and pragmatism concerning international relations constantly temper each other, often producing entities that, if not necessarily ideals of charity and brotherhood, at least are not mindless predatory organisms but instead are commonsensical and neighborly. Heinlein seems to suggest - correctly, I believe - that without collective security we could find ourselves at the mercy of the real Social Darwinists.

 Heinlein's work with transnational organizations can be grouped into four main categories: the earlier, more idealistic novels such as Space Cadet (1948), which incorporate fairly successful transnational organizations that often attempt not only to keep the peace but to do other good as well, saving lives and protecting individual rights, all the while supported by generally democratic political infrastructures; the later, more cautiously internationalist novels exemplified by Have Space Suit - Will Travel (1958) and Glory Road (1963), wherein organizations consciously limit themselves to an often more pragmatic peacekeeping; the infrequent warnings against governmental intrusion, like Stranger in a Strange Land (1961) and The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress (1966); and, of course, the occasional pieces like Farmer in the Sky (1950) and Time for the Stars (1956), which merely employ some basically unexamined form of world government as a conventionalized science fictional backdrop. Though in 1958 Heinlein wrote to his agent decrying the naivete of the "starry-eyed internationalists" who urged disarmament and who longed for a "world state" (Grumbles 210), in his own work Heinlein himself apparently cannot help longing for some sort of transnational peacekeeping entity, albeit often a more practical one.

Citizenship could be revoked if:

A person obtained, retained or resumed citizenship by false representation, fraud or by knowingly concealing material circumstances (for example, information that could have impacted his or her eligibility for citizenship or permanent residence).

And could be revoked from dual citizens if the person:
served as member of an armed force or organized armed group engaged in an armed conflict with Canada;
was convicted of treason, high treason, spying offences and sentenced to imprisonment for life; or
was convicted of a terrorism offence or an equivalent foreign terrorism conviction and sentenced to five years or more imprisonment. Note: Revocation on these grounds would only apply to persons with dual citizenship, to comply with Canada's obligations under the 1961 Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness.

...


The vast majority of cases (those related to residence fraud, concealing criminal inadmissibility or identity fraud) are decided by the CIC Minister. More exceptional cases, such as those involving war crimes and crimes against humanity as well as cases regarding security, human or international rights violations and organized criminality, would instead be decided by the FC.

	<TEXT> One can show that every developed country was aware of the risk of harm from continued emissions, as early as 1992 and in a number of cases even earlier. And therefore have a moral obligation to help those who have least contributed to the problem, and are most vulnerable to the risks, to adapt to climate change.

Not like the brazen giant of Greek fame,
With conquering limbs astride from land to land;
Here at our sea-washed, sunset gates shall stand
A mighty woman with a torch, whose flame
Is the imprisoned lightning, and her name
Mother of Exiles. From her beacon-hand
Glows world-wide welcome; her mild eyes command
The air-bridged harbor that twin cities frame.

"Keep, ancient lands, your storied pomp!" cries she
With silent lips. "Give me your tired, your poor,
Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,
The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.
Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me,
I lift my lamp beside the golden door!"

What I'm saying is that we are all going to need help. /r/postnationalist Were in this together. </TEXT>
