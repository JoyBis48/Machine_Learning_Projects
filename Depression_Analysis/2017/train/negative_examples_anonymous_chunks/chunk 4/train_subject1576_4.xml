I slide out of my bed onto my floor and I spend a few minutes reflecting on the AA 3rd Step and my wishes for family and friends.  I log on to /r/stopdrinking and record my commitment in the daily Check-in or later in the morning depending on what time it gets posted. Then I do a few things around the house and I'm off to coffee and to read the New York Times at a local Starbucks with my pal, "the Dude" where we solve the problems of the world, flirt with the women customers and hob nob with the other regulars.

	<TEXT> 1.  I didn't "quit drinking" which implies "forever."  Instead, using the [ideas at the Baby Steps post I stop drinking by making a renewable resolution to not drink TODAY, only no matter what happens good or bad.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)

2. I was in professional and criminal trouble, and I was seriously considering killing myself; 

3.  I needed to extinguish the old reinforcers--friends, bars, clubs, events that fed my need to drink.  I found new reinforcers in recovery, morning rituals as I described in the [Baby Steps](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) and by participation on r/stopdrinking.

Good luck to you. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My advice is very simple: 1. you aren't qualified to run a sober house so don't try; 2. keep alcohol out of your premises; and, 3. go to al anon meetings.  You might also try asking your question at r/alanon.  I don't mean to be unsupportive but the situation sounds untenable in my experience. 

Best of luck with this and thank you for caring so much for an alcoholic to dare to undertake it.  I hope I'm wrong but it does not sound like a good idea for you, your family or your friend. </TEXT>

That's great but that brings me to the [least popular advice in early sobriety: dry people, dry places.](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2szkp8/the_least_popular_advice_dry_people_dry_places/)  Obviously, this is your sister's wedding, so you must attend, but what compels you to sit through a drinking reception and all that nonsense beyond an initial appearance and pictures?  

What I did in early sobriety was insure that I was at an AA meeting before and after the event.  That my transportation away from the event wasn't blocked-in, and I WALKED the moment I felt stress or temptation.

Good luck to you and keep us posted. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My sponsor is a gentleman I met at one of my first meetings and who was familiar to me as an acquaintance from my professional life.  John G is about 10 years older than me, and I see or talk to him on average once a week.  He's like a big brother.  He's more conservative re: AA than I am, but he's also the primary source of the information that makes up [the Baby Steps.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) I too shared the /r/stopdrinking website with him and he really doesn't get it, but toi be fair he really doesn't understand his cell phone, either--although I told him that lots of info that I communicate originated with him. 

I get SUPPORT and good information from John G about recovery and someone who will pick up the phone when I call.  I couldn't ask for more.  If I need friendship and running buddies I can find that too, although they don't need to be sponsors.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Excellent post, /u/yurikovski!  But, my friend, this is far from unusual. Coming to see and value the lifestyle changes in alcohol abstinence is really the point of the push to sobriety.  And the insight that alcohol use is merely a symptom of a larger problem, is classic recovery dictum.  So, here's my cautionary note: an object in motion tends to stay in motion, a drinker who is not making progress often as not falls back into the drinking abyss.  I did after 15 continuous years of sobriety.  

Good luck, my friend. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Great post /u/big_mac_heart_attack.  I will say that when I was at 20 days sober I was in no position to judge whether I had lost a social life or not.  I was in no position to make any judgments about what the future held.  I was on an emotional roller coaster and it was going to takes some time before I could fairly assess anything.  I do know this--when I got sober I had to stay in dry places and with dry people to improve my chances of staying abstinent since in my experience and in the experience of my support network bars, clubs, and concerts were too close for comfort to my old reinforcers to my abusive drinking.  I needed new reinforcers which is what I got when I jumped into recovery which for me meant AA meetings and activities.  Good luck to you. </TEXT>

When I've established enough mental space around this, I'm going to suggest that we talk about how I must have made her feel when I did these things to her in the past because of how badly I felt.

Your friend sounds like she's reaching out to you to be helpful, but don't misconstrue what she's saying that seems to minimize your "qualifications."  She's merely trying NOT to judge you or proselytize--letting you judge for yourself if I understand your post.  Go, have fun.  Let us know if you think you related. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I made a decision this morning that I am not going to drink TODAY no matter what--consistent with [the Baby Steps;](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/38ohrj/new_here_the_baby_steps_are_a_pretty_good_place/)  I went ot an AA meeting; I communicated with friends in my support network; and, even though I've had a pretty tough and anxious week I am going to bed sober.  If I thought there was any risk that I was going to drink tonight, I'd be in an AA meeting talking about it, but that's how I approach the issue.  I'm not going to throw away my continuous time sober because experience teaches me that no matter how bad I feel about anything if I don't drink it will get better.  This was true for me when I was in prison, this is true for me NOW. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Recently I've been reading a scholarly work, *A Natural History of Alcoholism, Revisted* by Dr. George Vaillant, a Harvard professor of psychiatry which makes the point about "alcoholism" that academic research supports the view that alcoholism (and by definition alcoholics) deal with a "unitary disorder" or disease.  It is a disorder of some complexity and that alcoholism is NOT a matter of binary diagnosis, e.g. you got it or you don't. Instead alcoholism is often a *matter of degree* a lot like heart disease, or a diabetes.  To call it a disease is to simply underscore that once an individual has lost the capacity consistently to control how much and how often he or she drinks there is a sufficient basis to conclude that they are alcoholic and that treating the conditions makes considerable practical sense.

I don't know if that all comes off as clearly as I can see it--maybe because I'm an old guy and I get this whole heart disease/diabetes metaphor.  I'm a diabetic.  Consistently food of all sorts push my "A1C" as found on daily blood tests into a range that my chronic disease endangers my health: eyesight, heart, and puts me at risk of neuropathies, and amputation loss of extremities.  I can remain healthy and live a full life if I make proper daily decisions about my diet and exercise.  When my diabetes blood-sugar is consistently in the normal range it's easy to think I'm not diabetic, but I am.  I'm not powerless over my disease and in fact I am RESPONSIBLE for self-treatment.

The same with my alcoholism.  I am a real alcoholic, I've proved that to my complete satisfaction.  I am not afraid of the word at all.  I find it empowering.  No physician ever diagnosed me as alcoholic, and despite my several decades of recovery in AA, no one in an AA meeting ever "labeled" me as alcoholic.  I can not consistently control how much or how often I drink, if I drink even one drink.  Recovery via AA has given me a whole new way of life, and it has helped me find a path through the chaos of my life.  Finally, I've been able to put to rest the debating society in my own head about who I am and what I am responsible for. </TEXT>
