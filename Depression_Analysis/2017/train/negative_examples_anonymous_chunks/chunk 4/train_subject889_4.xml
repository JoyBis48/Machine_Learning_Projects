	<TEXT> I am going to assume that you have not experienced any of the type of catcalling I am referring to.

That single occasion wasn't the only time I have experienced something like that. I have been called a slut because I didn't respond to one man. I have been told I am ugly anyway because I didn't respond to another. 

So excuse me if I make a few assumptions about men who call out to women on the street. They aren't all out to rape me, but even if it is just a wolfwhistle, it is very clear that they just don't understand how stressed out it can make women feel. What if that simple appreciate wolfwhistle I ignore is just the prelude to something more horrible? I stick by my saying "most men" because if you are a man, you would have little idea of what it is like to have strangers ogle you, call out to you, or whistle at you since you were 13 years old almost *every* time you walk down the street. I have spoken to people about this and it is common for men I speak to about it to brush it off, calling it a compliment. I did not say most men DO call out, and I did not say most men threaten to rape me, I said most men think the mild forms of catcalling are OK. If this generalisation offends you then...well that's not my problem.

On top of this, I really don't appreciate you telling me "I hope you don't have sons". I probably will have sons and I will certainly make a point of teaching them what behaviours I feel are unacceptable, which I feel includes any kind of public singling-out of women based purely on their looks.

For the record, I never once went on about "the patriarchy, the patriarchy", "rape culture" or "male privilege". I simply shared my personal experiences. They aren't wrong and you can try all you like to dismiss them, but I will use them to teach my children what is acceptable and what is not. If you think that will mess them up, then I don't want to think about what you will teach yours </TEXT>

Reality isn't meant to flatter, it just is. You can't sprinkle glitter on a turd and call it a diamond. If parts of your town are as bad as this doco makes them seem, then serious change needs to happen...and I am not talking about the show producers </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Great read.

Time and time again it just floors me that most men think it is OK to shout things at women, even if they have a wife, gf, sister or daughter.

I was getting catcalls early in my teens because of my big chest, even when I was in school uniform. At first I was flattered, then annoyed, then eventually I found out what happened if I ignored these men...I was threatened.

Once, I was walking home from uni and was catcalled by a neighbor down the street. I ignored him...so he threatened to rape me.

What. The. Fuck?

I had to change my walking pattern home. I usually walked through a park with little lighting because it saved me 15mins...but I had to change that because some fat wank didn't get his ego stroked when I ignored his caveman-like advances.

It makes me sick, and I hope to one day have sons and show them just how horrifying this behaviour is. Maybe change will come eventually. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> One time, sitting out the front of my house in rural Queensland Australia, I was absentmindedly staring at the trees across my yard when suddenly, one of the branches moved.

For some stupid reason my brain instantly decided there was a monkey in our tree, but then I remembered I was in Australia, so it changed and decided it was our cat.

We don't have a cat.

It took one more moment, during which my brain contemplated the possibility of ninjas in our tree before the branch moved again and I realised I was looking at one of [these]( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/79/Tawny-frogmouth.jpg).

	<TEXT> A comment I wrote a while ago to another post:


One day, my husband and I were out the front of our house when a little streak of white came out of nowhere and disappeared under our car. After a little bit of coaxing and calling, I pulled out the smallest, most frightened ball of fluff ever. Poor little pup was shaking so bad. He didn't have a collar on, and he was so cute and frightened I instantly decided that he was mine. My husband, however, was more practical and insisted I take him to a vet to check for a chip. Reluctantly, I did, and unfortunately there was a chip. It was registered to an address right around the corner from ours.

With a heavy heart and an armful of wiggly, fluffy puppy I went home and then set off down the street. As I turned the corner I saw a girl in her mid teens sitting out the front of her house, crying. As I walked up she looked at me and then her face lit up with the most joyous smile. With no hesitation I handed back the fluffball and the girl burst out with tears of joy.

Man, I wish I could have kept that puppy, but no amount of tiny puppy kisses were worth having to see a heartbroken girl mourning the loss of her new friend. 

TLDR, found puppy, found microchip, found joy in returning it to its owner


Edit: I am going to be one of those people who say "Holy cow! My first gold!" Thankyou anonymous stranger for popping my gold cherry! </TEXT>
