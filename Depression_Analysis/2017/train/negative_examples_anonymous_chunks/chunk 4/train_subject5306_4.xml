	<TEXT> To be fair, the mobile phone menu system was used first in Saints Row, and worked much much better. Plus I'm prreeeetty sure the first Saints Row was the first game to use the whole circular bars filling up around the circular mini map thing that GTA 4 and tonnes of open world games now use. Maybe. </TEXT>

But I thought District 9 was very overrated and just as flawed as Elysium so I guess I'm just crazy. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 29 isn't really true. Of course the actors in Alien knew an alien was going to burst out of John Hurts chest. Unless they somehow left it out of the script and none of the actors noticed when halfway through the scene the director yelled cut and they brought on a prosthetic body cavity and spent hours prepping the animatronics. In the making of on the special edition DVD they say they didn't know exactly how it would pop out and what it would look like, and they said they were surprised by how much blood there was.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I like it a lot, but I dunno, I think it's moving a little too fast. It's only a ten issue series so it might not have the time it needs to really flesh out the story.

I love the premise, I love the build up, I love the mystery, I love this huge epic storyline they're trying to craft, I love all the ideas, but whenever something really spooky or interesting or atmospheric seems to be coming, the issue either ends, or we have some monster movie horror action jammed in. I feel like this book would be perfect if it was allowed to be a little slower and more tense and restrained. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No way. The suit is fine for the Toho films, but it simply wouldn't work at all for modern Western Audiences. I love the suit and the miniatures, they're really fun and great to look at, but CGI can do so much more than a suit can. It can move so much more realistically and perform in a much more advanced way. For the direction the 2014 Godzilla movie is going, a suit would not work at all. CGI is the best possible way to make a serious realistic and dynamic modern Godzilla movie for a wide audience.

The problem with the 1998 Godzilla movie, wasn't the CGI, it was everything else. CGI is a great amazing tool that can do mindblowing things that couldn't be done otherwise. It's all about how you use it. </TEXT>
