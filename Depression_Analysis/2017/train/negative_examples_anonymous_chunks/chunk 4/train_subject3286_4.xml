I was eating a maximum of 1400 calories on a ketogenic diet and started eating less and less until I wasn't eating anything at all. (yeah I was joking when I called you a pig; you really shouldn't go down the same path as me, but if you have bellyfat and boobs, you should keep cutting, as it is much healthier to be underweight than overweight) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> you need to hit the gym and bulk up. also take some martial arts classes. then if he hits you, you can kick his ass.

or you can call the cops on him for domestic assault

either way, lift weights and learn martial arts. there's nothing wrong with gaming, but it shouldn't be your only hobby. I also like inline skating, reading novels, and trying to get laid at bars. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> ok let's get this over with. my gamertag is Magoo Senior. I need this shirt because I love pugs and if I express my love of pugs I will most definitely get laid. I'm kind of broke so I can't buy it myself. A pug shirt would be a great conversation starter, and I am a very charismatic guy. I am quite handsome, but I need to work on my body. I used to be fat, so I have some loose skin. I probably need loose skin surgery, and I should start lifting again to look aesthetically pleasing to the ladies. I don't imagine that chicks like looking at underweight guys with tits.  </TEXT>
