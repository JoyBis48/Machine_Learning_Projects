	<TEXT> I was always disappointed that they didn't reveal who the marauders were, I always thought the twist reveals at the end of PoA were amazing, I couldn't believe how they left so many out of the film. 

I also would have loved to see Dobby and Winky in Goblet of Fire, as well as the Sphynx. 

I would have loved to have seen Wormtail have his hand choke himself to death.

Peeves. 

I always wish they would have included Nearly Headless Nick's birthday in CoS. 

And my biggest pet peeve with the movies is when Snape just shushes Harry before he goes up to kill him. In the book, Harry's under the invisibility cloak and is completely immobile, he would never have just let Snape shush him, he would have fought right away. Plus, it's so much more dramatic with Harry wanting to fight but not being able to... And when you find out it was Dumbledore's plan it just makes that moment so intense for me. One of my favorite moments in the books, devastating, but riveting. The movie's version was pretty lame compared to the book.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So... I start off by slicing the mushrooms into little slices and chopping the onions up to the size I want. I then take a pan and spray some organic olive oil spray, I use spectrum, but there are many brands. I usually have it at a high heat at first, then bring it down and up according to what else I'm doing in the kitchen. I put the mushrooms and onions in. I let them cook, sometimes with a lid, sometimes not, depends on how fast they're cooking, the onions seem to dry up before the mushrooms, so I usually put a lid after a minute for 3 -4 minutes, then take it off so they dry up a little. Then once they're all brown and a little burnt (I like them like that), I put a new pan on the stove, put the onions and mushrooms on after giving it another spray, then add the egg whites and broccoli and voila.  </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2013-08-01 22:36:10 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I was just discussing this with a friend and he didn't read the scenes at the academy the way I did. I really felt that the dialogue was alluding to some sort of sexual history between Frank and his pal. "Pleasing you" and "Yeah, but have you got somebody special?" and the "Come chill and let's go boating alone wink wink", really made me feel Frank was either gay or at least bisexual. The friend seemed to have some hardcore longing for Frank, and Frank, seemed too intensely into his job to even be willing to put something as dumb as lust before his career. As we know we haven't had many if any openly gay politicians in high places. I really liked it and I don't care if it comes back or not, but I was wondering if any of you read it that way too. My friend was kind of convinced after I told him and he said "Oh, maybe Zoe will uncover it or something" which could be interesting. What do you guys think? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I read this earlier today when I was in a place where fapping was not a viable option, and it resonated more and more through out the day... I guess, I technically have 20 hours now... I'm not gonna wait till Monday now. I was in some social scenarios today and I wish I was more on my a-game. Thanks for the wise words.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In Glendale, California there are luxury apartments in a mall. People sit on their balconies, living their lives, with their epic views of people buying shit. Always makes me WTF. You can kind of tell in this photo. On the weekends this place is PACKED.

	<TEXT> I get that. I just don't see how SanCorp can afford to seize enough property to affect Tusk if they're not as powerful A, and B, if Tusk becomes VP, they're still going to own nuclear companies... The more I think about it I get it's in SanCorps interest to derail Tusk becoming VP, it's just, how. I guess buying some of his companies makes sense to make him make sure things dont go into a blind trust...  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think what I'm a little gray about is what Underwood wants SanCorp to think they're gaining by overtaking these subsidiaries? Stopping Tusk, controlling Tusk (would that do that?)? It just sounded like a waste of money for SanCorp and a desperate plea from Underwood who isn't really one to beg, and is now, all of a sudden on SanCorp's side.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Underwood tries to get Danton to convince SanCorp to initiate a hostile takeover of the subsidiaries of Tusk's nuclear organisations.

That part, how / why would SanCorp seize Tusk's property if they're separate corporate entities? And substantially smaller than Tusk's business? And why would Remy have SanCorp seize these subsidaries all for the benefit of what? To have leverage over Tusk if he becomes VP? Perhaps that's it. Or perhaps to block him from becoming VP...? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think the VP thing was just blind luck. At the time of the DUI he wasn't thinking he would be able to get Russo to run for Governor and then kill him and get the Vice President to run in his place to secure the democrat majority in the house and then become the new Vice President. Maybe, in a crazy, 15th possibility of the events that were possible when he found out about the DUI, but at the time of it he just needed somebody who would do anything for him. He was mad about things early into the Presidency, needed to show he has power by having control over major events, and by the end of the season, luck had it that he was able to orchestrate such a big power play that he ends up in an even better position than Secretary of State.  </TEXT>
