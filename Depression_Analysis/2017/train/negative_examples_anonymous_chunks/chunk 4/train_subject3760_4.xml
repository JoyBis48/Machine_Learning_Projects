Pirelli were asked to get us to three stop races, and they've done a pretty good job of meeting that target. Speeds always increase through time as the teams find engineering solutions to the constraints of the rules. </TEXT>

"There are small improvements, but the road is still very long."

This a woman who is extremely close to the family and who has spent each day since the accident fending off almost any media speculation or stories about Schumacher. So for her to actually comment and say something positive (however small) is really good news.

With the type of injuries suffered by both Schumacher and Bianchi all you can really expect are (very) small improvements. A member of my family, sadly a child, suffered serious brain trauma and it took four years for any real progress to manifest itself. </TEXT>

The innovation was the mounting of the engine at 3.5 degrees to assist ground effect - something [copied more sucessfully by the Ferrari F10](http://www.auto123.com/en/racing-news/f1-the-striking-1979-arrows-a2-that-inspired-the-2010-ferrari-f10?artid=115830). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> True, but more recently the wind-tunnel issues demonstrated where their real problems lay. 

The engineers said we need a new 60% scale wind tunnel, management said make do with what you have. Basically the next four years were a write off! Management simply didn't understand the needs of the team - using alternative facilities whilst fixing their own basically cost five times as much.

It's one example, but it highlights the problem. The decision makers just didn't get it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 6 points is almost half the deficit! That Ferrari also wasn't as good as the McLaren in fast corners and was hard on its tyres. He could have won Monaco had he shown more patience.

You also forget Schumacher stalled it on the grid in Japan before the puncture. As I said, if he and the Ferrari had performed better he would have sealed it, but the car let him down and he made too many unforced errors. The DC crash hurt, but he had plenty of chances. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Several reasons:-

- Voting for this may allow them to make a deal on something they want now, or in the future.

- The extra engine might be helpful to Mercedes.

- Sporting considerations - everyone wants a competitive series.

- Having several teams able to test new engines (which may have upgraded components compared to race engines) allows Mercedes plenty of room for development and curing reliability issues.

	<TEXT> I doubt Ferrari are a serious factor in Mercedes decisions on this one because they seem to have good reliability, and Merc want/need the competition for the sake of the show. 

Its more likely that Mercedes would be influenced by their customer teams needs. Down grid, RBR and McLaren are a potential threat to Lotus and Williams - both teams where money plays a more significant role and data gathering is helpful (though not dramatically so). </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  James Allison tried his damndest to keep Alonso

He and Alonso have a relationship going back to Renault, but [I always thought that](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/formula-one/22470411) it was Alonso that wanted Allison rather than the other way around.

James Allison starting at Ferrari on Sept 1 as chassis tech direc will likely help pacify a certain Spaniard today, bet the phone's been hot - Martin Brundle

Of course Vettel had a stated preference for Kimi.

Id prefer Kimi. I need to be careful now. Nothing against Fernando, I respect him a lot as a driver but I think I respect Kimi on track and off track because hes always been very straight with me and from that point of view it might be a bit easier. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Seb's always talked of being a Ferrari driver, even when he was in the German BMW formula, there is an interview somewhere but I can't lay my hands on the link.

Interesting though, I'd long suspected that Ferrari had an informal deal with Vettel [because of his relationship with Schumacher, and Schumacher's dislike for Alonso] that when he was ready to move they would open the door. This also confirms that Ferrari left Alonso rather than the other way around.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ferrari just seem to have pursued a completely different car concept. 

If I understand RBR correctly they relied on the short nose solution to deal with the turbulent air over the front wheels, couldn't get it through the crash tests, and the car is a dog without it. Hence their thinking that they will see major gains now they have it working. 

Ferrari appear to have focussed on unleashing last years aero-compromised engine, improving the suspension geometry, and getting the cooling right, rather than expending staff time and money on the nose. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It was Ron's second F2 team, Project 4, that took over McLaren rather than the other way around. The MP4 designation [originally meant](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren#Sponsorship.2C_naming_and_livery) 'Marlboro Project 4', and was later changed to mean 'McLaren Project 4'. This only goes to show how deep the relationship with Philip Morris was.

Even now their current logo is a [stylised version of the Marlboro Chevron](http://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--usxchzXG--/c_fit,fl_progressive,q_80,w_636/18z0w45eftossjpg.jpg) - because that's what they're most remembered for. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No problem - my context wasn't clear in any case.

My partner is Black as is my closest friend and as a result I've become more aware of the subtleties of racism, or what could better be described as racially motivated criticism, than I otherwise might have been. 

Much of the commentary directed at Hamilton carries a tone of 'otherness' with it - its seeking to highlight aspects of his character, tone, style, and personal behavior that are different than what is perceived to be the 'norm' if you see what I mean. If you want to undermine something you raise questions of validity and highlight things that are seen as outside the mainstream of opinion.

For example. You could say that 'Schumacher was a great driver, but not a great sportsman' - if you wanted to acknowledge the greatness but undermine the validity of his considerable achievements by attacking his character. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My example wasn't specific to Moss's comments - I had meant in general, sorry if that didn't come across. 

I'm also not labelling *any* criticism directed at Hamilton racist, much of it clearly isn't and I share your feelings on this. But, there is quite a lot flak sent in his direction over the gold chain he likes to wear, certain celebrity friends, flat peaked baseball cap, 'hip hop' (i.e. not specifically music but black music), etcetera. I do feel has a racial motivation behind it because, broadly, its highlighting behavior or ways of dressing that are common in the black community but not in others, and the tone of such commentary is always critical.

Equally when you compare the media and fan treatment of Mansell, Hill and Button (basically national treasures in this country) with the way Hamilton is spoken about the contrast is quite stark. Hamilton is arguably the most successful British racing driver ever to have hit an F1 track, yet the validity of his achievements is constantly questioned in a way that other recent British champion's haven't been. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The point is that such things are used as a form of criticism of Hamilton, as /u/jimbodeeny demonstrated above when he said:

Probably something more like a racing driver Dan Blizerian than #blessed hip hop star Hamilton.

This kind of thing wouldn't be said in the same way about a white driver, its being used as a 'dog whistle' for less pleasant language and is clearly racially motivated. 

Damon Hill, for example, played guitar with George Harrison and Def Leopard while he was driving, in fact he appeared on the opening track of Def Leopard's 'Demolition Man' album. He and Eddie Jordan regularly played music together at post race events - this was never used as criticism at the time or since. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yep. To be honest I'm disappointed in him, every time Moss opens his mouth on Lewis or women in motor racing something crass comes out. 

When people like the English Defence League are putting your quotes on T-Shirts you should wonder if your views aren't a little out of touch. 


"In those days we were proud to be English. It's different now, there's probably only about ten million of us Englishmen left. All the others have come in here from God knows where....."

On women in motorsport:

"We've got some very strong and robust ladies, but, when your life is at risk, I think the strain of that in a competitive situation will tell when you're trying to win. The mental stress I think would be pretty difficult for a lady to deal with in a practical fashion. I just don't think they have aptitude to win a Formula 1 race."

The colour scheme was shortlived: McLaren only ran in orange F1 livery between 1968 and 1971, incorporated a notional orange streak into its Yardley-liveried cars of 72 and 73 and phased it out completely when Emerson Fittipaldi brought the full red-and-white might of Philip Morris Tobacco onboard when he joined for 1974.

	<TEXT> The [video isn't any less terrifying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1pJo3sLpVk) than the photos.

Only yesterday I was pointing out that of the 29 regular drivers that started the 1968 season alongside Jacky Ickx, 13 died racing or testing in the 7 or 8 years that followed (though only a few in F1). Driving was a brutal career in those days.

They were: McLaren, Rindt, Clark, Solana, Schlesser, Rodrguez, Spence, Scarfiotti, Bianchi, Siffert, Bonnier, Courage, and Moser.

In May 1967 Bandini was racing at the Monaco Grand Prix, running second to Denny Hulme on the 82nd lap, when he lost control of his car at the harbour chicane. He had just entered an S-turn when his Ferrari's left rear wheel hit the guard rail, sending him into an erratic skid. It impacted a light pole and overturned. The car hit straw bales which lined the harbour side, rupturing the fuel tank, and sparks ignited the fuel as the car rolled over, with Bandini trapped beneath it. Marshals flipped his car upright and pulled Bandini, unconscious, out from the flaming Ferrari. It is thought that, during the effort to right the overturned car, gasoline leaked on the hot brake line or the exhaust pipe and exploded. A second fire occurred when the gas tank exploded after Bandini had been pulled away from the Ferrari.

Bandini's burns were extensive, with third degree burns covering more than 70% of his body. The worst burns were on his arms and legs with slight burns on his face. Doctors were forced to wait for twenty-four to forty-eight hours before resolving to move Bandini to a hospital in Lyon, France, which specialized in the treatment of burns. Other options considered, by the doctors, were flying in skin grafts from Italy or a specialist burns unit team from East Grinstead in England. The burns caused severe lesions. He also sustained a chest wound and ten chest fractures.

Three days later, Bandini succumbed to his injuries. He died at Princess Grace Polyclinic Hospital in Monte Carlo. There were concerns about the promptness of Bandini's rescue. However, investigators from the Principality of Monaco ruled on 10 May "that the security operation had functioned properly." The straw bales, having been banned from all Formula 1 races in response to the accident, were replaced by an extended guard-rail the following year.

Bandini was buried in Reggiolo on 13 May. 100,000 people attended the funeral. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Mercedes dropping away, or other teams catching up on their development depending on how you view it, in general thats the long term effect of the rule changes on the engineering side. There is basically one or two good ways to get the best out of x rule inside x car concept, and the competition is to see who can find and balance that against the rest of the car more quickly.

According to legend Hamilton was convinced by the factory tour, just as Alonso was by the same thing at Honda. Both appear have felt the engineering commitment sufficient to put them in contention for wins.

30 odd years watching says you can never count Ferrari out (for the first time in those years I have a positive view of Ferrari), and they appear to be on track for a good 2016. Personally I don't take the potential move seriously - but you never know. </TEXT>

Also its Ferrari, even Hamilton said that only a fool wouldn't consider driving for the most successful team in F1 history, no matter the circumstances.

- Schumacher to Ferrari (Ferrari 3rd, Benetton 2nd in 1995)
- Hamilton to Mercedes ~~(Mercedes 4th, McLaren 2nd in 2011)~~ (Mercedes 5th, McLaren 3rd in 2012)

The engine installation seems to be off, mapping, brakes, balance, the car seems to be a dog. I also have to say that IMO the attitude of the team management is helping their cause at all, and it may be time for a change.

I do hope that you're right though. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Absolutely, but it appears to me that its the power delivery rather than than the bhp that is the real difference. Merc had by far the best power unit in the two years preceding 2014, but didn't have the chassis to match it. But they were focussing on 2014 and little else.

I'm not counting RBR out in the slightest and I believe they'll get a lot out of the B spec car, but I don't think they'll be racing at the front because of it. Will certainly enjoy finding out though. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'll bet Ferrari are holding their updates until after Monaco - the package they have right now seems well optimised for the hotter races and could do very well there, especially with their excellent cooling setup. 

Interestingly Ferrari don't seem [bothered by the short nose](http://www.espn.co.uk/f1/story/_/id/12622228/james-allison-explains-ferrari-nose-design). Red Bull were having issues with the crash tests and, I guess, built the car with that kind of nose in mind. Perhaps that's why they're expecting such large gains from it. Ferrari seem to created have a different car concept entirely, rather than investing a lot of staff time into a crash tests and such.

I do wonder if there wasn't a price elsewhere on the RBR car for getting the short nose done. </TEXT>

Obviously you're correct. I'd tried to phrase it so it was clear-ish (i.e. racing or testing without qualifying the series) that relatively few died in F1 cars but didn't succeed! It was commonplace, even expected, in that era to drive in multiple series though. 

Its an awful list, and that was just one season's drivers, almost all were dead before 1975. Sad. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's because SAP is a team sponsor, but they're one of a shrinking number, and only three of 10 teams on the grid have a title sponsor right now (Sahara don't count as they own 40% of the team).

What SAP specifically get is proof their cloud solution works in one of the worlds most data intensive professions, and their competitors in that field, Microsoft, also sponsor F1 extensively. But SAP's real involvement is with McLaren Technology group and their F1 and road car computer systems.

However none of that is what we're talking about at all. Sponsors are increasingly funding younger drivers as a low cost, high value, route into the sport. Santander for example funded young Alonso - he took their personal sponsorship to McLaren (and left them there, where they picked up Button), and to Ferrari, where he again left them. Maldonado bought in PDVSA who are major sponsors of his old team and new one. Teams very often give slots on the car to drivers management to place, and increasingly so. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Most of the drivers that competed alongside him died that way, in that era you had less than 40% shot at surviving your racing career. Many successful drivers walked away after a WDC win, not wanting to chance their luck any further.

Ickx, started in F1 1968. Of the 29 drivers that completed more than one race in that season 13 died racing or testing in the years that followed - 46% of them. They were McLaren, Rindt, Clark, ~~Hill,~~ Solana, Schlesser, Rodrguez, Spence, Scarfiotti, Bianchi, Siffert, Bonnier, Courage, and Moser. 

Edit: As /u/meowlong points out, not all of these drivers were killed in F1, but its worth saying that this is because it was commonplace at the time to race in multiple series. This isn't a comment on F1 safety specifically. </TEXT>

Fangio won two drivers championships with the team.

The 'Silver Arrows' name came from their domination of the old Grand Prix series in the 1930s, and they entered F1 in 1954 with Fangio switching from Maserati to join the team and immediately dominated the 54' and 55' seasons winning everything in sight. Sterling Moss partnered Fangio in 1955.

This should also sound familiar, past is prologue for Mercedes!

Sadly it was the Mercedes-Benz 300 SLR that [went airborne and killed 79](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMoh5hZAaZk) people after hitting the back of Lance Macklin's Austin-Healey at the 1955 Le Mans, their Magnesium Alloy body work increasing the severity of the post accident fire.

	<TEXT> Nope, that's failing to understand what Ron actually said.

Why would the team go *back* to a livery that they have barely used in the modern era, in fact a livery that they only used for two years, and has little association with the team for most fans - what would it get them? 

Even now their current logo is a [stylised version of the Marlboro Chevron](http://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--usxchzXG--/c_fit,fl_progressive,q_80,w_636/18z0w45eftossjpg.jpg) - because that's what they're most remembered for.

However, most people now associate the team with the silver/grey livery so they made a decision to stick with it and add in some Honda branding, the black appears to have been part of a deal with Johnnie Walker or SAP that fell through looking at their previous sponsor branding. But really the whole thing was a message to Honda and to sponsors - we're willing to change it, but you need to get on board and pay us in order to do so.

FYI the silver colour is for Mercedes, West's branding always appears on a white background. </TEXT>

Basically the driver's 'brands' have become more important to the sport than the team brands and one thing F1 can do to support that is increase the association between drivers and their helmets thus strengthening their brands. Fixed driver numbers is a tilt at the same thing. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There were 4 other 180 mph crashes at Tamburello in the years leading up to Senna's crash - all drivers survived with the worst injury being a severe concussion. Its a flat out corner with a river behind it, hence the concrete wall. Arguably the severity of Bergers crash foreshadowed Senna's but all of the crashes involved some kind of technical failure, and all look very similar.

- [Piquet 87'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLyAKkeA25Q); 
- [Patrese 92'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCcf_aTuldY) ; 
- [Berger 89'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVxnkaqqO2c); 
- [Alboreto 91'](http://flatoutcombr.c.presscdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/alboretocrash.jpg). 

Which is all by way of saying that Senna crash led to F1 managing downforce and thereby speed, but all of that was really a consequence of the driver aids ban. In many important respects the FW14B remains the most technically advanced F1 car ever created.

Both deaths led to the HANS device as they were both on a [long list of drivers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HANS_device#History) that sustained basilar skull fractures. Senna's death wasn't caused by the skull fracture though. </TEXT>
