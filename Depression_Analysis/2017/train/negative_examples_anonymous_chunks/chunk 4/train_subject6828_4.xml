	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> The Tesla machine that Angier uses for his ultimate trick creates a duplicate of Angier. One remains in place at the machine and another several feet away. My question is if the "real" Angier is at the base of the machine isn't that certain death in regards to the glass tank beneath him? This is assuming that the original Angier is at the base of the machine. If it isn't then the original Angier dies during the first usr of the machine back in Tesla's house. So what was it?  


=calibrating the machine to Copy Angier the base of the machine and teleport the real Angier to a different spot.

=or Angier is fine with dying over and over to best borden


=Or maybe another possibility I haven't thought of. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, it's been accepted that Wash's death is the most brutal and emotional in the Whedonverse. It really hurt and was done ultimately because Serenity was a last hurrah for Firefly(as was River's rushed character development). However, if we were to get Firefly back, we would want Book and Wash back, even if it meant in a parallel universe. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I expected this insight, I know it's kind of a cheat but Firefly itself was cheated and fans would look over this if it meant Wash and Book could come back. It's the writing equivalent of saying,'we're starting over because we didn't get a fair shot the first time.' And quite frankly it seems less sci-fi that we Unkill wash than Firefly coming back (please Netflix).

Joss has said that when he is done with Marvel and Nathan is done with Castle he might revisit the 'verse.


I don't think it's so outlandish to accept a universe tear, even in today's world we are experimenting with particles that could erase everything. I will concede that it's a bit of a coincidence that wash be near the crash site.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Batman's footage is very interesting. He leaps from rooftop to rooftop, when decending upon the criminals of Gotham you can see him systematically pick them off and beat them to a pulp.


However, Tony Starks footage is just more fun to watch, he zooms through the battles and shoots at folks while cracking smart ass comments.


In this respect, the thing to remember is that Batman probably suffers from a mental disorder since he habitually goes out to fight crime and takes no pleasure in doing it. Tony Stark can notice the danger in what he does but will make it fun to watch all the same. </TEXT>
