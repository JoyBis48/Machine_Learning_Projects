	<TEXT> I am inclined to agree with brightbrightfish. My grandpa came here from Germany in the 30's and while he loved his heritage he never bragged about it. He played harmonica and acordian,made willow crafts, was an acomplished wood worker in the old ways ect, but first and formost he was an American.  if anyone referred to him as a German he would let them know that he worked hard to get here and even harder to learn the language and pass the tests to become a citizen of the USA and he was proud of that.Whatever happened to that way of thinking? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Music evolves first from imitation then inspiration then inovation.The blues came from African spirituals . Blue grass came from colonial spirituals.Combine them and write risque lyrics: Rock N Roll! Combine all that with a Europian accent:The British invasion of the 60's. Any musician that whines about another copying his "style" is a douch.Never heard Muddy Waters complain about other artists playing electric guitar,and never heard Hound Dog Taylor complain about George thorogood playing loud distorted slide. </TEXT>

I agree that racism is alive and well in this country, but when I see this kind of shit it makes my heart sink. If you really care about the issue then adress it intelligently. BTW Zimmerman is some kind of Hispanic and the victem was black.These guys have seperate gangs that hate each other,no whitey involved. In the end it's the money that wins every time.

Had some good friends there and miss alot of things about it, the prices at Millers,take a drive to Hastings and pick up free taters along the road,my friends at the Clock,the river(Georgia sucks!)Palatka song writers,pig races at the fair,tales of the Bardin booger,The Oasis(I got freinds in low places) and so on.But my original post is true,not rumor and not the only story I could have told.

	<TEXT> I love my Shuns,great steel,great looks and no heel,I hate the heel.
The handles are also a joy. Would I use my Shuns at work in a super busy 20 seat tourist town diner? ARE YOU CRAZY?! They hang on the wall in their bamboo "Shrine" and I use them for special dishes. I also love my original Pure Komachi set,cheap but very sharp and look nice.
I use these daily at home for light duty stuff. My home beater is an old high carbon forged that I had professionally reground. The point being,
buy what you like and don't listen to self professed experts,most of them are not experts.If you like it get more,If not,well now ya know.
I agree Vics are the best buy and always recomend them to my home use friends but they're not for me. "Far better than Shun for less"?
DON"T YOU BELIEVE IT! Those are German brands trying to imitate Shun. As far as the edge holding debate goes,serious Japanese chefs
sharpen their knives on a stone EVERY day. The knife I use at work?
 A gaudy tv personality signature knife that I bought on a whim and turned out to be perfect for what I need at work. Ha Ha! enjoy your Shuns! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Saw the origanal Lynyrd Skynyrd band back in the day at an amphitheater with a huge lawn for outdoor seating.Security in those days was just some rent-a-cops to keep people from jumping over the fence.this was THE biggest party I have ever been to, probably 16 to 18 thousand people,booze,all the illicit stuff,everyone just having a rowdy good time and Skynrd were spot-on kick-ass JAMMIN!
But wait...there's more! They played just about all their stuff except Free bird and Sweet home Alabama and said good-night,crowd is really nuts with encores, lighters,(remember that?) and rebel yells.
They come back on and do a short set and finish with Free bird then say good-night again.Crowd is now going nuts again and this goes on for about 1/2 an hour, the stage is dark and people are starting to get ready to leave.A loud voice from the darkness says, "What song is it you wanna hear?"and then,dun dun dada da dun dun dada,and the stage lights up like a Christmas tree.A confederate flag big enough to cover the entire back-stage drops and they launch into Sweet home.
I have never seen anything like it, it was raining beer cans, the screaming could drown out a jumbo-jet,just...nuts. One last thing, this was in upstate NY.
