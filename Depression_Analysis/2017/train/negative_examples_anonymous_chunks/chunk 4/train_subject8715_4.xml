	<TEXT> This might get buried, but I wanted to share my Christmas tradition with you guys now that it's officially the Christmas season. Since high school, my friends and I have done this crazy marathon. We buy a shit-ton of terrible food, laugh, and enjoy all the best that Christmas has to offer. Even though my friends live in different states now, they're flying in for this crazy ritual.

I've seen a lot of posts about marathons/traditions here, but I have never seen anything as crazy as this. So, hopefully you guys appreciate this and feel free to ask questions!

Here's our schedule: [CMM Schedule](http://i.imgur.com/q0wZ8ou.jpg) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We decided that whoever wins the loser's bracket gets 1st pick. The champion is last pick and everyone else is random. It keeps the consolation players involved and it's more fun that way. </TEXT>
