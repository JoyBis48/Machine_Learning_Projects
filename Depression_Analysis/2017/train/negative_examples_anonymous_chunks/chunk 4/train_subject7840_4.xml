	<TEXT> I've hired lawyers to do routine things three times in my life. Every time I end up angry at cost overruns and feeling nickle-and-dimed.

Maybe it's you.

In all three cases, the final costs have exceeded the lawyers' own original estimates by a factor of 2-3, even though none of the tasks had any surprises that might explain additional costs.

In your opinion.  Evidently the work was more complicated than either side thought.

I mean, seriously? $27.55? It took you twenty seconds to compose that and your secretary could have done it.

Lawyers charge for their time in 6 minute increments.  You should not expect to get any free work from your attorney at any time.

In the end if you feel overcharged your state likely has a procedure to dispute a fee. </TEXT>

No.  16 year olds eventually become 18 year olds.  There has to be a line somewhere between letting children and adults vote.  Children cannot vote because they are young.  They will eventually, by completely natural processes, be old enough.

	<TEXT>  I am seeking advice from anyone familiar with NJ and the municipal court system here. Is it appropriate to attempt to contact the county DA/ADA in advance of the hearing to try to plead?

No.  Wait until the court date.

If I go to court, pleading not guilty to the charges on the citation, and the municipal prosecutor refuses to offer a plea bargain, am I then able to seek a continuance from the municipal court judge to seek legal counsel? 

You will go to court and get in a line to speak with the prosecutor.  The prosecutor may or may not offer you a deal.  The deal will almost certainly still involve pleading guilty to speeding at a lower rate, perhaps 14 over.

If you are unhappy with the deal, or are not offered a deal, you can request a postponement to obtain an attorney. </TEXT>
