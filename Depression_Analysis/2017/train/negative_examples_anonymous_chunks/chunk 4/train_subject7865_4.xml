This notion that you have to pick now and be stuck with it is outdated at best - people will certainly ask you what you want to do, but there is nothing wrong with not having a simple answer.

For now, though, make the most of it and enjoy the time you do get with them. </TEXT>

This is particularly key - if we give people a basic income but don't improve education it won't have a big impact. I don't think it is the income as DerpyGrooves says, so much as the fact that people's (particularly women's) time is taken up with other things  </TEXT>

If you need treatment and think it may be more severe than the docs are saying, demand blood tests! </TEXT>
