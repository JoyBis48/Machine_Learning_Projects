	<TEXT> I had this crush on a girl in high school for years. After we graduated she said to me, "I really like you and wished you would have asked me out."

I told her at that time my feelings for her and about the crush and she said, "oh I was just kidding around I didn't really mean that" and she walked away laughing. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The bathroom at Lafayette Coney Island in Detroit.. 

Anyone who has been there knows what I'm talking about.. 

The walk to the bathroom is terrifying. If you survive the trip you must then attempt to avoid hitting your head on the pipe that is in the bathroom. Once successfully completed beware of the cockroaches coming to take advantage of you with your pants down.
