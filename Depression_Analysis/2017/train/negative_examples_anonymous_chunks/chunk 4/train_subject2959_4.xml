	<TEXT> Going to homecoming this weekend (I'm a senior in high school) and I was wondering if it's appropriate to wear a knit tie with a 2 button suit. Aren't knit ties supposed to be more casual? Also, what is the appropriate width of a knit tie? I know they're supposed to be skinnier, but what is the correct width? 2 in or 2.75 in? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Chrome Resolution/Sizing Problem </TITLE>

	<TEXT> I recently updated chrome along with a bunch of other windows 8 updates and now my browser sizing is off. The resolution is blurrier and larger than normal. My laptop is 1920x1080 and it feels like I'm back at 1360x768 when using chrome. For example, here is my new tab page, clearly something happened to the resolution as this image used to be full screen: [Here](http://imgur.com/DofT7ca)

How can I fix the resolution of chrome? </TEXT>
