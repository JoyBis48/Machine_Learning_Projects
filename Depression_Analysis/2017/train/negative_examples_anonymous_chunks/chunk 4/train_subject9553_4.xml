	<TEXT> Okay, while I agree with the sentiment of the submission and am not a Zionist apologist whatsoever, I think its wildly irresponsible; not to mention very misleading to make up fake quotes. 

I know Elizabeth Warren came out in support of Israel during the Operation Protective Edge last summer, I was very disappointed when that happened, I felt it exposed Elizabeth Warren as just another Zionist. 

However, she never said these words, and this meme submission is circlejerky to say the least. Find me a reputable source of her saying this and I'll retract my statement, until then I'm calling bullshit.

You can't just go around making up fake quotes for people you dislike or disagree with on global issues. If that were the case I could just put up a picture of Netanyahu saying how he'd like to wipe out all of the Palestinians and drink the blood of their children. 

Do you honestly think that a savvy, liberal politician like Warren is going to give such a ham handed, blunt statement like that ?  </TEXT>

He defamed Jesse Ventura in his book and Ventura took him to court and won $1.8 million in a jury settlement, so thats a pretty ironclad, confirmed lie. 

Not for nothing, these weren't little white lies that the average person tells. This is a case of this guy writing a book about his life and lying in the book about his life and then selling the packaged lie to the American consumer, so its a little different.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It whitewashes the fact that Iraq had nothing to do with 9/11, none of the hijackers were Iraqi, 15 of the 19 were Saudi Arabian, the US's second best ally in the region after Israel. 

I love it, Saudi's attack us, so lets deploy troops to Iraq, foolproof logic. Clint Eastwood linked Iraq to 9/11 with the way he set up that sequence in the film. Eastwood needs to stop making films, this film was a 2 hour celebration of jingoism and xenophobia. 

Did he at any point in the film have any of his characters say:

"Hey, why the fuck are we even here ? Weren't we attacked by Saudis ?"

No, he didn't.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Simple solution:

Don't enlist. 

Problem solved. 

At the very least don't enlist, go over there and wantonly commit atrocities just to come back and here throw your service in my face, I didn't ask you to enlist, so don't act like you did me a favor.

The worst thing returning veterans say to civilians that question the motives for the war they participated in is:

"I fought so that people like you could have freedom"

Or something childlike to that effect, completely oblivious to the fact that they are just mere pawns on some billionaire banker/industrialist's chessboard. The war in Iraq was NOT about defending our freedom, or about 9/11. It was about taking out a dictator whose policies no longer reflected the US's best interests. 

Saddam was going to start pricing his barrels of oil on the international market in Euros and not in dollars or petrodollars, which would've adversely effected the dollars status as the international reserve currency. That more than any other reason is why we went into Iraq. Don't delude yourself into thinking it was about protecting our freedom here at home. I certainly can't remember the last time an Iraqi tried to curtail my freedom, even the notion is ridiculous.  </TEXT>

They made him into a Christ-like saint who gave it all for his country. The film will without a doubt increase enlistment. [Besides Clint Eastwood is US veteran, do you think he would honestly make a film depicting the army or a marine in a negative light ?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clint_Eastwood#Early_life)

Look at Clint's other military film, *Flags of our Fathers*, its unabashed positive depiction of the US military in Japan in World War II, it might as well be a recruitment film.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Really ?!

I think starting a war on what was later proven to be manufactured, phony evidence and bombing a country back to the stone age would make the United States the savages in that situation. 

The US left a power vacuum for religious strife to take place, they created a platform for it. Then you have people like Chris Kyle blaming the victims of war for getting sucked up in a power vacuum that he helped create. The idiocy and ignorance looms large in that mans worldview. 

Furthermore you have the US army engaging in brutal torture on Iraqis in Abu Ghraib prison, setting dogs on them and electrocuting the prisoners genitalia to get perverse pleasure. That's pretty savage if you ask me. Good luck justifying the atrocities committed by the occupying US army in Iraq, you have your work cut out for you.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yea but its 2015, we shouldn't treat people that are outwardly racist as the heroes of our society. 

All this movie does is encourage young Americans to enlist in the military and continue an unending war overseas. It simplistically displays the complex reasons we went to war in Iraq. 

For instance, in the film they show the events of 9/11 and in the very next scene 18 months later, Chris Kyle is miraculously in Iraq, a country that had nothing to do with 9/11. The film attempts to whitewash US history. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Here are some Chris Kyle quotes from his book *American Sniper*:

*Savage, despicable evil. That's what we were fighting in Iraq.* 
 Chris Kyle, *American Sniper*

*But I wondered, how would I feel about killing someone? Now I know. Its no big deal.* 
 Chris Kyle, *American Sniper: Memorial Edition*

*Savage, despicable evil. Thats what we were fighting in Iraq. Thats why a lot of people, myself included, called the enemy savages. There really was no other way to describe what we encountered there. People ask me all the time, How many people have you killed? My standard response is, Does the answer make me less, or more, of a man? The number is not important to me. I only wish I had killed more. Not for bragging rights, but because I believe the world is a better place without savages out there taking American lives. Everyone I shot in Iraq was trying to harm Americans or Iraqis loyal to the new government.* 
 Chris Kyle, *American Sniper*

This is the hero that the American people are lionizing and holding up so high. This movie is pure propaganda and I refuse to be anyone's useful idiot and support this jingoistic, xenophobic film. 

He referred to people protecting their homeland from an occupying army as savages, I guess that would make the founding fathers and the soldiers who fought in the American revolution savages too then, right ? Wait no, those people were white so they can't be savages, they were patriotic, red blooded Americans.

	<TEXT> Did you see the recent report that said that the US has already spent 3 trillion in the global war on terror ? 

Who do you think that 3 trillion is owed to ? 

The bulk of it is owed to a slew of defense contractors. Who do you think makes the bombs, tanks, fighter jets, ammo rounds and body bags ? General Electric and their ilk. War is business and business is a booming. 

Do you know who General Smedley Butler is ? He is one of the most decorated General/marines in US military history. He wrote a book in 1933 called *War is a Racket*, in which he atones for his past sins in the US military and admits that it was all for the United Fruit Company, Brown Brothers banking house and a few other major corporations. Here is a link to War is a Racket on YouTube:

80 years later its still true that War is a Racket, now more than ever. Listen to what General Butler iterated 80 years ago.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Max Blumenthal is the author of *Goliath*:*Life   Loathing in Greater Israel*. Anyone interested in the plight of the Palestinian people should seriously consider reading this book. As a Jewish person, Mr. Blumenthal is allowed to really critique the quagmire in the occupied territories without the fear of being labelled an anti-Semite. 

We should try to support his work, because he is really putting himself out there on the forefront of this debate with this book which I would consider to be his most important piece of writing. He gets called all types of things by the Zionist crowd, self-hating Jew, etc, etc. 

I think writers like him are the most important advocates for a Palestinian state, after all he grew up in a Jewish home and took the birthright trip to Israel so many young Jewish people take. He has an indispensable perspective on the situation in Israel and Palestine.  </TEXT>

The only thing you'll see change is wedge issues, if Bush goes in you'll see abortion rights limited. If Hillary gets elected you'll see marriage equality advance. All of the truly substantive issues will remain the same, we won't leave Afghanistan, we won't end the war on drugs, we won't curtail the global war on terror, we won't do anything about the growing economic inequality and the death of the middle class, etc, etc ...

	<TEXT> They also haven't passed a resolution condemning India for warring with Pakistan in the Kashmir region. 

If Palestinians who are Muslim, haven't condemned India for the actions taken by India against Pakistan in Kashmir isn't that enough ? 

The fact that India is not a Muslim nation and they still haven't drawn any ire from Palestine, a Muslim nation on the Kashmir quagmire, is evidence enough of their appreciation of India.

Furthermore, what can Palestine do for India when they have Israel breathing down their neck, constantly encroaching on their own land and reducing life in Gaza to an open-air prison. If India would stay the course I'm certain the people of Palestine would reciprocate India's many good deeds if only they could. 

Israeli's are violating a slew of international agreements and UN mandates when they continue to violate Palestinian's human rights in the future Palestinian state. The parallels between what Palestinians are going through now and what Indians were going through under the British Raj are endless. 

Palestine first needs to be in a situation where they can pass some sort of mandate that would be substantive on the Kashmir quagmire. Right now, they are just getting by, surviving on what subsistence Israel allows them. In these troubled times for the Palestinian state, they are using their religion as a pillar to strengthen their resolve. Much like Gandhi and Bhagat Singh did in the face of British oppression. 

They shouldn't be punished for being Muslims, like many of the other Indians on this thread would like to do. The Palestinians are the unabashed victims in this situation and India is flip-flopping on their proud humanitarian history and turning their backs on the colonized to appease the powerful the Western countries (US   UK) that would like nothing more than to see Israel take over all of Palestine. That is what Modi's vision for India is, an appeaser of Western imperialism.  </TEXT>

India was once a great example of a burgeoning power that cared about humanitarianism. Now under Modi, we just do what America and England tell us to do, and turn our back on other people that are being colonized my Europeans. This change in policy is rife with hypocrisy.  </TEXT>

India was once a shining beacon for shaming the rampant colonialism taking place in Palestine and the occupied territories. Modi is ruining that great legacy of humanitarianism. He's turning India into a vassal state of the West, rubber stamping their colonialism at the UN. India might as well just turn over its UN vote to England, with Modi in charge.

Modi is turning India into a puppet state for the West. India has sovereignty, so they should act like it.

	<TEXT> I posted this in the comments section of the other submission about /r/documentaries and Monsanto so I'll just copy and paste it here:

I've had bad experiences with the mod team over at /r/documentaries.

For a few weeks I posted great documentaries there that regularly made it to the top of the page. I posted a documentary about Monsanto and it made it to the top of the page and the comments section got wiped out. The shills lost the PR battle in the comments section so the mods took it upon themselves to remove all of the comments.

The straw that broke the camels back was when I posted a documentary about Israel and Zionism and Palestine.

	<TEXT> I've had bad experiences with the mod team over at /r/documentaries. 

For a few weeks I posted great documentaries there that regularly made it to the top of the page. I posted a documentary about Monsanto and it made it to the top of the page and the comments section got wiped out. The shills lost the PR battle in the comments section so the mods took it upon themselves to remove all of the comments. 

The straw that broke the camels back was when I posted a documentary about Israel and Zionism and Palestine. It was removed and when I inquired to the mod team I was accused of having an agenda and attempting to use /r/documentaries as my personal soap box. When I countered by sayng that their censorship of my documentary was evidence of the mods of /r/documentaries having an agenda, I was banned. I never did attempt to appeal my ban. Why ?

I even messaged them selected paragraphs from the article that demonstrated how this article dealt specifically with US politics and the IAC (Israeli American Committee) which is basically another AIPAC, and they still said that the article was "Off Topic". 

Pretty poor judgement, something tells me they didn't even read the parts of the article that I messaged them. They had their minds made up, regardless of what was in the article.  </TEXT>

You feel like those are your words, thoughts and iterations that are being ridiculed by a seemingly endless cadre of shills, trolls and conspiratards. Try to look at it this way, your iterations are provoking this response from these shills because they don't want the users here to be emboldened enough to submit their own original content to this sub. They don't want this place to be one that is friendly to original thoughts, they want you to be scared of criticism. 

In short, they don't want anyone here to get enough confidence in themselves by way of positive feedback from the /r/conspiracy community because then they might have another James Corbett on their hands to worry about.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Content control is a slippery slope, I see plenty of things that I would like to remove, but that would lead to inevitable cries of censorship. What we like to do is let the users decide what should make it to the top of the page. If you want to do a good write up/self-post encouraging more users to visit the new submissions page then I would definitely present it to the other mods for a sticky nomination. I think you make several valid points here. 

If I had my way I would remove the majority of UFO/ancient alien submissions made to the sub, but I can't do that without alienating some of our userbase or being accused of being some sort of malicious government censorship agent, when in reality I just find UFO conspiracies to be childish and amateur. As a matter of fact I would even go as far as saying that some of those UFO video submissions are submitted here by the conspiratard crowd and brigaded to the top of the page to make us seem like a less serious sub, of course I have no way of proving that. 

But I digress, write up a good self post encouraging users to visit the new page more often and I'll nominate it to be stickied atop the page for a few days and if its agreed upon your sticky will go up and you'll see the quality of the front page go up drastically. That way front page submissions are better and the mods won't hear cries of censorship either.  </TEXT>

In the first 2 seasons you only got to see angry Darryl or impatient Darryl, of course in season 3 his brother Merle's passing let you see angry/sad Darryl. In this past episode you could see that he was inconsolable. I would like to think that what got him is that an innocent, young life was cut down so suddenly right in front of his eyes.  </TEXT>

1. 2 guys in the Nebraska episode in Season 2

2. Shane in Season 2

3. Tomas at the prison in Season 3

4. A few (approximately 2 I think) of the governors people in Woodbury in Season 3 

5. Rick killed that member of the marauders in the house that he, Michonne and "Coral" were staying at, in the bathroom upstairs in Season 4.

6. At the end of Season 4 Rick killed the guy who tried to rape "Coral" and the guy he bit, so that one was a twofer. 

7. Rick began Season 5 putting up some numbers, he killed according to my estimations 4 people during the great escape from Terminus, remember he sneaked up behind them with an automatic rifle and took out their legs, leaving them to be killed by nearby walkers. 

8. Then Rick killed Gareth in the church because he made him a promise, and what good is a man who can't keep his word ? 

9. And of course this past episode started with a bang with Rick taking out that cop who wouldn't listen to him. 

So according to my estimations, that makes a grand total of 15 people that Rick has turned into walkers.  </TEXT>

This store owner is an Indian immigrant, he came here with nothing and tried to make something of himself. He doesn't have a dog in this fight, why are these rioters attempting to destroy his livelihood ? These convenience store owners don't even make that much money in the first place. My friends dad owns a convenience store just like this one and he's not exactly raking in the dough, this store owner probably makes most of his money from selling lottery tickets and tobacco products, just like the Swisher Sweets Michael Brown strong arm robbed from this very store.  So first he gets robbed by Michael Brown, then rioters and looters attempt to upend the way that he provides for his family in a vain attempt of misguided and misdirected anger. Their solution for police brutality is to rob someone who came here from a very poor country to earn a living, good job protesters /s.

2 weeks ago Jon Stewart spent the entire first segment of the Daily Show, making fun of the fact that Charlie Crist put a fan under his podium during the debate and that Florida Governor Rick Scott wouldn't debate him while the fan was there. This led to a 10 minute segment about dick jokes featuring the map of Florida.

John Oliver on the other hand will spend 15 minutes on one ACTUAL topic, and thoroughly discuss it, presenting both sides of the debate, as irrational as one side of the debate may be. Jon Stewart's bit is hackneyed and with Stephen Colbert leaving to host the Late Show next year, the path is clear for John Oliver to take over as the best current events/political comedy show on television.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There was also record low voter turnout this year. We haven't had voter turnout this low since World War II. You can't complain about kicking all the bums out and simultaneously sit at home on election day. 

The underlying issue is that access to voting in America is not easily accessible. You have to increase the hours of voting, and place more polling stations in higher population density, low-income, urban neighborhoods to truly address the issue. I'll cite a purely anecdotal example, myself, I leave work at 5:30 and then have to take a train   a bus home, leaving me just 45 minutes to vote after I get home. I got it done, but I imagine if I had to wait in line, instead of simply walking into my suburban polling station.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What I'd like to know is why Matt Taibbi *really* left Glen Greenwald's *The Intercept*. Back when I had more faith in Greenwald, I was initially excited to see that Taibbi had joined them as well. Then all of a sudden he dropped out from the fledgling news magazine last week, without writing one article. I wonder what happened behind the scenes between Taibbi   Greenwald ?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> TL;DR ? 

The answer is 14, 14 countries, that we've either bombed or occupied since 1980.

The definition of insanity truly is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Nah, I wish. 

If you're referring to the fact that he used a screenshot of my submission from /r/conspiracy about censorship on /r/worldnews, I did let out a tiny, audible squeal when I saw that. I can't believe that something I submitted to /r/conspiracy made the CorbettReport. If just goes to show you that even James Corbett realizes blatant censorship when he sees it.  </TEXT>
