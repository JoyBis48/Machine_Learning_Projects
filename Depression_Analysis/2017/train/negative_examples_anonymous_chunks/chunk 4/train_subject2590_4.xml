	<TEXT> Selfie actually means something though. That's like saying "I wish people would stop saying the word 'rap'". Rap is a word that describes a genre of music. Selfie is a word that describes a type of picture. It's not some stupid buzzword that people are throwing around. It actually means something.  </TEXT>
