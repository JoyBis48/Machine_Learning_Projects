The Muto were just trying to reproduce and feed, perfectly natural behaviour that we humans, like ants, got in the way of. 

Godzilla on the other hand came out of nowhere, killed the creatures and went home. He didn't even feed on them like a real 'apex predator' would have.

	<TEXT> Wordpress, I believe the visual editor, keeps removing linebreaks from some of my posts.

Sometimes it removes everything leaving me with a single block of text.

Sometimes it removes all line breaks from just tables.

I've searched high and low and not been able to find a solution.

	<TEXT> Sorry, that won't work.

The mentos reaction occurs because the surface of mentos are covered in tiny simples. Each dimples serves as a nucleation point for carbon dioxide in the coke. The gas gathers around each little dimple making a bubble.

If the dimples are filled with water/ice then you'll get no bubbles.

Try filling a DRY glass with coke. You get lots of foam because there is lots of dust and other imperfections. Now fill a WET glass with coke. Very few bubbles.

Stupid jerk science ruining my fun. </TEXT>

That film was lovingly hand animated. Each frame consists of layer upon layer of beautifully rendered art.

It is a homage to classic animation that has stood the test of time better than any CGI.

	<TEXT> I'm not really interested in ranking them. Even the weakest film is still pretty damn good. 

Also, each move builds on the strengths of that which went before. By itself, The Avengers would be a bit of a mess. Wait? Who is this doctor and why is everyone scare of of him? Why is turning into a monster? There is a norse GOD and no one is surprised? 

But, as a part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, it's amazing, a calumniation of years of work and billions of dollars invested. 

There really has been nothing like it in the history of cinema.

	<TEXT> As I mentioned in another thread, a good twist is one were the twist is entirely natural and, in hindsight, makes perfect sense but still blindsides the reader. 

In most cases, a good twist also changes how we FEEL rather than what we know. For example, we HATE the evil Jekyll in Jekyll   Hyde and feel for the put upon doctor. When we find out they are the same man, it changes how we feel about the two characters.  

Chuck Palanuik reused that same twist in Fight Club but, because he changed how we felt about the characters, in felt fresh and not cliched.

There are many stories in which we learn the hero is, in reality, dead. The only successful ones are those in which we care about the hero and his or her plight.

	<TEXT> My editor described this to me as 'gotcha' moments rather than 'a-ha' moments. 

A 'gotcha' moment is one where the audience is surprised with a new piece of information that they could not have seen coming, one that appear as if from nowhere. For example, the end of the 2001 Planet of the Apes film. 

An 'a-ha!' moment is one where the twist or development is surprisingly but, with the benefit of hindsight, makes perfect sense. For example, in the original Jekyll and Hyde, the twist that the two men were, in fact, one, is laid out through out the text.
