	<TEXT> Most of my experience was satisfiyng my domme sexual fantasies and desires, but there were also other tasks I loved to do, like going to the shop or helping her painting the room. Once she ordered me to write some tale very quickly in the typewriter while she was having a shower. She knew I like to write, so she wanted to make me practise and improve. That was nice.

I'm too lazy to cook. Maybe a domme that forced me to cook, learn more recipes and be more disciplined in my daily life would be great for me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Nice to know. I have been in a couple of dominant relationships. I've been dominant and submissive. Definitely I prefer to be submissive. You feel so great when you please your master! You have him/her in your mind all day long thinking about ways to please him/her, and that fills you with love. I miss that in a certain way.

Also, Honeybee, that's a cute nickname.

Have fun! </TEXT>

I wanted you. And I was looking for you.
But I couldn't find you.
I wanted you. And I was looking for you all day.
But I couldn't find you. I couldn't find you.

You're walking. And you don't always realize it,
but you're always falling.
With each step you fall forward slightly.
And then catch yourself from falling.
Over and over, you're falling.
And then catching yourself from falling.
And this is how you can be walking and falling
at the same time. </TEXT>

Places out of public access. Some huge, long basements where you have to go down all alone, long silent corridors, an attic where the light turns off automatically after a certain time and let's you there in the middle of the almost absolut darkness and silence. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I played my No Love Deep Web record while practicing a method my therapist taught me for releasing my anger and anxiety. It consists in hitting a phone book with a piece of plastic pipe while you scream.

So, No love was blasting, and I was hitting the phone book as hard as I could, following the ryhtm of the beats, shouting things like "I'm not gonna be sad!" and "I'm gonna be happy!".

Later I got interested in magick and occultism, so one day I tried to practise my own purification ritual. I wrote in my arm "Do what thou wilt, shall be the whole of the law", and in my leg "Love is the law, love under will" (both quotes from The book of the Law by Aleister Crowley). I cut my hair while listening to Beware. Cutting my hair had always some kind of symbolism, like leaving the old stuff behind and starting a new phase. 

I can assure you I felt quite powerful, like I was doing something really meaningful or, at least, different, as Manson spoke in the intro. Then I took a shower. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Me and my best (girl) friend are huge fans of AT and sometimes we meet and watch the new episodes. After that we use to discuss and get to the same point: the show is getting more adult. AT started as a children show, but it got a lot of young adult fans, and they have to adapt to that. Adults want more complexity, more mature themes, deepness, sub-plots, story arcs.

But I wouldn't worry. I think the show will always preserve its touch  of innocence and be children likeable. Even in the most serious episodes, a lot of fantastic and absurd things and jokes happen. </TEXT>
