	<TEXT> My fraternity house is literally a minute walk away from the stadium for Georgia Tech in Atlanta and a ton of people would drive by it to park on gameday. We would stand out in the road(not blocking traffic obviously) with a beer and a sign saying you honk we drink and basically every car that went by would honk. Whenever cops would roll by all the time and do their little *woop woop* siren and we would finish the can. It was awesome.

I was also only 18 at the beginning of this and looked about 16 so basically the cops didn't give a fuck/ </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Pulling the old Sir John A. Macdonald, only Canadian Prime Minister to win six majority governments.

  One famous story is that during an election debate Macdonald was so drunk he began vomiting violently on stage while his opponent was speaking. Picking himself up Macdonald told the crowd, "see how my opponent's ideas disgust me."

In another version of the story, he responded to his opponent's query of his drunkenness with "It goes to show that I would rather have a drunk Conservative than a sober Liberal.". </TEXT>

This is the same kid that got my car stolen by leaving my keys in my unlocked car outside a party in a sketchy area. Luckily I found my car at 7AM next morning parked just around the corner from where I had parked it. The keys were sitting **on my hood** in plain view so I guess someone had a fun joyride in it.

	<TEXT> No he sensationalized it pretty heavily. I can't see anything constructive about adding 2 base pairs to DNA, when life seems to do fine with just 4. Maybe it will give us more choices with amino acids, etc. but considering we can't even really design our own proteins now due to post-translation modifications and not understanding folding and a whole number of other issues.

This is pretty cool I guess but nothing super ground breaking and I believe it implies that we are close to things like designing our own proteins that nature could never design when in actuality we are pretty far away. It also really doesn't seem like this author understands the whole transcription and translation process and how this applies to building proteins

	<TEXT> So it's a 2d game where you control various types of ships using only the key board. Tab is shoot rockets, ctrl is bullets. It's basically like that old school asteroids game where you except multiplayer with 8 different types of ships, objectives(CTF, king of the hill, etc.) and ton of different weapons. The objectives on the maps are super fun, the game has a great community and it's really easy to pick up but hard to master. It's definitely worth the 5 minutes it takes to install it and try it out.

	<TEXT> I would periodically move things around their desk around while they are focused on something else. Maybe move a notebook from a drawer onto the desk. Maybe move a pen they just had in their hand onto the other side of the desk. Things that would be physically impossible to happen. This would be very subtle, maybe once or twice a month at most. Gradually I'd start doing more obvious things, like unplugging their monitor or making a stapler fall off their desk for no reason. 

Maybe after 6 months of this, I would start writing messages to them, either using a pen and one of their notbooks that is out of sight, or distracting them enough to write something like **LEAVE THIS PLACE** OR **WAKE UP** on their computer. Maybe I would do this with notes or if they are working on something in word, just type it in the middle of their document. Eventually they would begin to doubt their sanity. As they neared the breaking point, if I sensed they we're going ot loose it soon, I would draw dickbutt in paint and tile it as their background. I would then write "turn around" and have a couple hundred thousands dollars in my hand(which I had stolen using telekinesis) and give it to them to maybe make up for the torture. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I seriously think they should make a tagpro type game with a 3d engine. Maybe something a little like LoL, you would have skills(like jukes or spins or sprint) which would be on a cool down. Maybe even different classes(scout, defender, etc.) too but you would move with WASD.

Edit: Just to clarify how I'm picturing it: It would still be CTF. The only way to die would still be running into each other, or maybe some type of special move. Maybe there would be some projectile type attacks you could aim with the arrow keys, but of coursee they would have cooldowns.

Can anyone elaborate on why this would be a bad idea. I don't care of downvotes I'm just curious

I wouldn't want to have sex with the queen but it could be kind of hot if she watched. She has always seemed like she has a "wry" sense of humor and has always struck me as a woman of intense curiosity. How cool would it be to bring a chick back to your place and she sees the queen sitting in a chair in the corner as you frantically undress each other and she stops and says "oh gosh, it's you!" "It is an honor your majesty!" and she awkwardly curtsies while covering her tits with one hand, "charmed my dear, now start fucking!" At first she is really demure and tries to be as tender and "proper" as possible, missionary only etc. and the queen starts shrieking "none of that, when I said start fucking, I meant start FUCKING!!!" and maintains steely eye contact with her </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Maybe it is that simple, but I'm sure there are other factors at play. Yes 3 legs on the ground at all times is great but what about for walking over things? What about getting away from predators? Etc. Is it the most efficient for all these factors which highly influence the life and death of the insect and in turn the strength of the colony. 

It obviously is because insects have 6 legs but what I'm trying to say it's not just basic geometry by any means.
