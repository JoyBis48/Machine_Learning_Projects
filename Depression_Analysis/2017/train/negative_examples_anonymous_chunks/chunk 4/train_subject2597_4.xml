	<TEXT> I would like to reinforce that it's the insurance companies that screw up costs, not the hospital or clinic. The purpose of insurance is to collect as much money while paying out as little as possible. The hospital will charge $100 for an advil pill but will only get $10. That's why bills are so high, it's a negotiation game.  </TEXT>
