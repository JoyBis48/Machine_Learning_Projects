	<TEXT> Hey! Thank you for the honest feedback. I 100% agree with you on everything you are saying, and if it was something I was used to putting together I would totally be going for high end components. But my big concern is that this is the first one I am working on, period, and if I screw it up I'd rather have lost a 105$ piece of junk than several hundred dollars worth of gear. I'm looking at this as a hobby, and this is just me cutting my teeth, and in the future they're probably going to have way higher end gear.

I'm not expecting amazing results, and I fully expect a few mistakes, but I'd rather screw up cheap bargain-bin parts than really nice choice components. I see this guy being a schlepping instrument, that will be retired to a nice case on a wall when I build another one with really nice parts.

Plus this lets me trace the body blank on to some graph paper so in the future I can hopefully make and route the body myself. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Simple but good example: Food service.

Not paying sick days essentially forces a low income earner (the sort of person who would be working at a food service job in most cases) to choose between taking sick days to get better, or sucking it up and going to work. They don't have the option of choosing to go to work or not because they likely live paycheck to paycheck - losing a day of pay could literally mean no food on the table or not paying rent.

So, they go to work sick. While there, they then expose food and other workers to their illness. They also are less productive while working. Other coworkers become sick, and you lose even more productivity as the sickness spreads through your workforce. Customers potentially get sick, and if it's bad enough that customers track you down, you are exposing yourself to massive lawsuits.

Between a multimillion dollar lawsuit worst case scenario and giving a worker the day off with pay when they are sick - well, which would you rather pay?

I have a personal theory that many people have a difficult time understanding indirect consequences of actions, or maybe they understand them but have a harder time comprehending the spidering-out chain of effects that their actions create. Because sadly, there are dragons in those effects. </TEXT>

If I have to wipe them down with a wet cloth already, i may as well make the cloth wet with soapy water and just spend 2 seconds more scrubbing and be done with them.

	<TEXT> Hey everyone. I have been curious about this for awhile. The actual act of buying/selling is easy. My big concern is making sure that packages get out to customers in a timely way.

I am still starting, so any volume that I would generate would be miniscule, and likely way too small for a fulfillment center to be interested.

Did you pay for custom packaging? How do you handle boxing and adding packing material? This stuff, if you go to office max or even the post office is absurdly expensive. Enough so that I lose any kind of competitive edge. The post office offers free shipping boxes, but the flat rate is really high - $9+.

So far I have just been saving boxes and as much packing material as possible from Amazon. Some guy I know also tried getting a bunch of free boxes from USPS and inverting them until he found out it was a felony :( </TEXT>

Kinda like hearing about a murder on the news - it's ethereal and doesn't really have much impact on you most of the time. So instead to them it's just lost time that they're stuck on the train.

If they actually saw the body or if they're on the front of the train and they see the person hit, that would probably change their tune a bit. But maybe not.

The drivers and ticket takers are always really on edge though - it hits them pretty hard (as you would expect). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, it may not be quite what you are looking for, but I have been on several trains where a person has jumped in front of the train (you didn't specify the kind of accident). Usually you just feel the train screech to a halt. The ticket takers start going nuts and run to the front of the train. About 10 minutes passes and an intercom message plays that there appears to have been a fatality, and to please be patient. At that point you realize you are stuck for the next minimum of 30 minutes until another train can be redirected towards you. They pull the trains side by side so you can't see anything, and then move you over to the other train.

Other passengers usually flip out about how "selfish" the person was to screw up their day, and you question why exactly it is wrong to punch complete strangers for being such assholes who can't realize that their minor inconvenience was a day in someone's life that was so bad that it made them jump in front of a train.

There have been 2 times where I have seen the body. There's a lot of blood, and not much recognizable as a person. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I understand what you are saying, but I have to disagree somewhat. You're ok with raising for food lifeforms whose evolutionary path diverged from ours 50 million years ago, but not lifeforms whose evolutionary path diverged from ours 10 million years ago (dates are wrong obviously, but I think you understand my meaning). I don't agree with that distinction.

As for the land - most studies of the least harm doctrine have asserted that a mix of both animal and plant agriculture minimizes the actual loss of life. Remember that when land is used for plant agriculture, there is still a staggering loss of life. Native plant species are cleared en masse, and that often leads to mass starvation of native animal species. Rerouting waterways for irrigation can cause further damage in similar ways. The act of preparing soil, tilling and harvesting kills massive numbers of soil-dwelling mammals. The word pesticide is a portmanteau that means "killer of pest animals." So, even if we switched to pure plant agriculture, animals will still die as a direct result, even if we haven't raised them for it. And sadly, it's often in larger numbers than in animal agriculture (I'm only talking about direct impact, not indirect where the numbers go all over the place on each side of the fence).

There's not a simple answer to this one, as much as I wish there was. </TEXT>

Honestly, I suppose it isn't that far off.

Still, it's far better that the animals be treated well than forced to put in restrictive enclosures. I mean, ultimately, they are being raised for food. At some point, they will die. There is no way to sugar coat that. It's the brutal truth. But at least while they're alive they can be treated with dignity and given a modicom of respect, you know? </TEXT>

Do you feel that a lot of videos similar to yours that are heavily publicized purposefully forget to mention that this is factory farms that perform these practices, and NOT all meat processors or, worse, farmers?

I have family who work in the farming industry, and take their animals to be harvested at small processors. The animals are treated extremely well until the end. But watching most of these videos, it seems like names are often replaced with blanket terms. So instead of "Smithfield meats does this" it is advertised as "Farmers do this!" or "Meat processors do this!" Instead of showing the more truthful message that this isn't how it's done everywhere, the videos seem to specifically omit names to create a sort of "everyman" out of the industry.

PETA is notorious for this.

I understand that the bulk of Americans get their meat from factory farms (and these videos ARE necessary to prevent abuse), but painting the entire industry with the same brush also hurts those small farmers and meat processors who really do treat animals properly until the end. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I know several cops. Most of them perform the minimum amount of range time required because they'd like to actually spend time with their families when not on the clock. Sure they may visit every now and then to hang out, but it's usually more camaraderie than it is for focused training.

Remember, cops aren't intended to be soldiers, they are intended to be civil servants. Not all of them want to be dirty harry. The problem is when you place someone who hasn't had that much range time or, more importantly, live fire training in a high pressure situation, their trigger fingers can get itchy - hence police racking up over 5000 civilian deaths since 2001, while only 1800 police officers have been KIA. In January of this year, 176 civilians were killed by police in the US alone. That's more than the average number of officers KIA for an entire year. That's why we're seeing sweeping criticisms coming down from the justice department because of how bad training is for cops to deal with those situations.

If we insist on arming cops with firearms (which is the only sensible course since civilians can have guns in the US), they really should require live fire training.

I wonder what ratio of those 5000+ civilians were shot by a cop who was a combat veteran, vs cops who weren't? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Molds are weird. Some science fir you...

If you have a layer of good mold, and a spot of bad mold, the good mold CAN overtake the bad. Or vice versa.

The real problem is that mold spreads through something called "mycelium" which is kind of like a plant's root system, except far more efficient at moving chemicals from point a to point b. That is a big concern. If the bad mold produces any toxins, they can absolutely get picked up by the good mold and transported through most of the mycelial network. 

So even if you cut off "bad mold" the "good mold" may now be toxic. </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2015-03-24 15:35:06 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Pretty simple question I hope. I have an extremely long commute to/from work (about 2.5 hours each way). Along the way, just about every day I see several old pieces of furniture on the curb.

After seeing the prices of some hardwood, I can't help but think this would be a great way to get free source materials.

My biggest concern though - pests. For instance, if it's upholstered, there is a chance that it could harbor bed bugs (they're rampant in our area). If I put it in my car, the bed bugs could take up residency there, and from that point it would just be a matter of time until they made it into my house. So, upholstered stuff just isn't worth the risk given that problem.

What about wooden furniture? What kinds of pests could I be bringing into my house if I brought, say, a desk? What mitigation can I do to ensure I don't bring anything unsavory home? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Just want to bolster this. In any time you are dealing with chemical exposure to living things, some are going to be more robust against the chemical than others. This is why in humans, when talking about material safety we refer to it in terms of LD50 (lethal dose for 50% of the people exposed). The same applies across all living things. Those who survive are by definition more robust against that chemical (for one reason or another). If they are capable of reproducing, at least some of their offspring will likely inherit this trait.

This is a textbook case of how evolution works.

	<TEXT> That's great - but I think you're missing that Acadians WERE French. They were some of the early settlers on North America, and they brought Beignets with them. They then migrated southward where, etymologically speaking, Acadian transformed into "Cajun." So, like I said above, the French can still probably claim Beignets, but just not in mainland France. They're the state food of Loiusiana. Whereas in France... they're just another pastry. The level of emphasis placed on them is considerably different. I'm not saying this out of disrespect to the French culinary tradition, but Cajuns place beignets on a pedestal the French simply don't.

Further, France didn't "invent" them per se. The French beignet, like most carnival doughnuts, is an evolution of the Roman pastry scriblita. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You would think that, but check the wikipedia article for beignets - while the french invented them, New Orleans is the place that's famous for them (specifically Cafe du Monde). Heck, just google "beignet" and you'll see what I mean. They're the state food of Louisiana.

And remember - Cajun culture IS French culture, at least originally - Cajun came from ["Acadian"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acadians), early French immigrants to north america. So technically the French are still the most famous for it, just not from mainland France. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is going to be a long post, sorry! I agree it is most likely a variation. My point is people are going after OP because it isn't "authentic," but this is one of those cases where you really have to question "authentic". Lots of other doughnuts aren't entirely authentic - especially not this style. It's a carnival style doughnut (made with all of the crap you had to clean out of your pantry before lent so you wouldn't get tempted). Just like fasnachts, beignets, kinklings, malasadas, and so on.

So does it match what you'd see all over Poland? Probably not, but that also doesn't mean there isn't a single baker there who doesn't prepare it differently. For example, here's yet another form, pczki serowe from a polish baker, in Poland:

http://sprawdzonakuchnia.pl/wp-content/uploads/ewpt_cache/960x640_50_1_c_FFFFFF_cfe767548249254abeae462fa0b2627d.jpg

That's still Polish pczki but appears completely different. Like I said - all of these pastries are variations on a theme: big fatty pastries that you eat to clean all of the lard and other naughty goods out of your pantry before lent. They show up all over Europe, so I'd expect to see massive numbers of different variations. Just because one family does it different from the norm doesn't really make it incorrect, just different. Most of these doughnut recipes were dictated by what was in the pantry. If one family was incredibly poor they may not have had fruit/cream on hand regularly, and so developed their recipe not having any fruit or cream. If one family was wealthy but still wanted to participate in lent, they may have had to cut the pczki so they could stuff everything from the pantry into them (a la OP). Most families would probably fall somewhere in the middle - stuffed fruit inside of the pastry, matching what most Polish folks are used to (a la the traditional pastry you mentioned). That's how these recipes developed. They're a big festival food that served a specific purpose (cleaning out the pantry) so variations are bound to happen based on all kinds of factors.

The whole "It's right!"/"It's Wrong!" argument in a recipe like this is like arguing there is a set ingredient list for ratatouille. In reality it was a dish made by poor people who made it with whatever they had on hand. Fighting for authenticity is a fool's errand because the ingredient list was determined entirely by what was in the garden.

I agree that there is a common notion of what the pastry should be, but that doesn't mean that other family's recipes for the same pastry are inherently wrong - they might just have a different evolution than the popular one. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> TIL that most cultures have their own fat tuesday donuts. I have only ever heard of having fasnachts on [Fat Tuesday](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasnacht_%28doughnut%29) but apparently these guys serve the same purpose for the Polish culture. 

And if the dough is anything like fashachts (which, based on the description it is), it is going to be relatively high in calorie (about 500 calories) - they're made from potato starch water, flour, sugar, milk, egg, salt, yeast and lard, and then deep fried. That is just the dough before you add any kind of filling. In the case of fasnachts, they're usually either served plain, or covered in powdered sugar/sugar glaze/granulated sugar, and often people cut them open and spread molasses/table syrup on them. </TEXT>

[Biegnet in Paris](http://voyages.ideoz.fr/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Berliner-boules-de-berlin-beignet.jpg)

All of these are donuts/zeppole/biegnets. They're just either different family recipes, varieties, or regional interpretations. I mean, New Orleans is supposed to set the standard for beignets, but every time I've been to Paris beignets look extremely dissimilar, and the dish in New Orleans evolved from French Beignets. Both are legitimate. Same goes with the donuts and zeppole. </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2015-03-23 15:03:43 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hey everyone.
I really want to begin woodworking, specifically with an eye towards instrument making. However before I start getting into really expensive tonewoods, I want to make sure I have an ok collection of tools and have some experience woodworking under my belt. As the title says, I am a complete newbie. Beyond a pinewood derby car, cutting some crown molding, and shop class in high school, I don't have much experience at all with woodworking. I want to change that.

I had wanted to start by making an end-grain cutting board, but when I saw the price of hardwood (moreso when my wife saw it) there was a very loud lack of enthusiasm. In addition, every plan I've seen required a planer which I don't have. I was looking at the prices of them and it seems like a hefty jump for a first project.

So, can anyone recommend some simple projects for someone who has very few tools and very little experience? I don't mind picking up one tool, so long as it can be purchased reasonably.

I have a 10" miter saw, a table saw, and a jigsaw (outside of the normal tools like hammers/drills/etc). Any advice would be really appreciated. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> First, I'd see if you are near an Indian grocer. A lot of times they have spices in whole form that can then be ground fresh in the home. Whole spices last MUCH longer than ground. Plus at ethnic markets you can buy them in reasonable bulk for a fraction of the price. For instance, instead of buying ground ginger (which could already be a year or more old when you pick it off the shelf so it has very little flavor), go to the indian market, pay a fraction of the price for whole dried ginger and throw it in a spice grinder when you need it.

The same goes with turmeric, dried chilies, cinnamon, black peppercorns, nutmeg, allspice, cloves, etc - there are a bunch available. Just eyeball what you think you'll need and grind up a little more. Grab a few spice containers (or save the ones you have now) to put leftovers in.

You end up paying less for a more stable product that produces superior results. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ahh, I too have to deal with the non-dairy non-gluten vegetarian challenge every time our friends get together. Here is a personal favorite (recipe based on the 2nd issue of Co-Operative magazine, but with some personal flare). The whole thing takes maybe a half hour with prep.

**Citrus Curd**

* Finely grated zest of 3 citrus fruits (at least 1 lemon)
* Juice of those 3 fruits (again, at least 1 lemon)
* 3 large eggs
* 2 free range egg yolks
* 175g caster sugar (just throw regular sugar into a food processor for 1 minute, don't waste money buying it)
* 100g unsalted butter cut in chunks

**Optional meringue:**

* Reserve the 2 whites from the yolks above
* 100g additional caster sugar
* pinch cream of tartar
* 1.5tsp cornstarch dissolved into 2 tbsp of water

Bring a pot of water to a boil, and grab a large mixing bowl that can be set over top. A double boiler works well too. Whisk together the juice, zest, 175g sugar, eggs, and yolks and place the double boiler/bowl over the boiling water, making sure it is not in contact with the water. Add the butter and keep whisking. Once the butter has melted, keep stirring until thickened (the specific term you are looking for here is nappe, when the curd can coat the back of a spoon, and when you can see trails where the whisk has been). This should be about 175 to 180 (do NOT go beyond that).

Use your eyes and see if there are any chunks of curdled eggs. If so, strain through a sieve. Serve into single serving ramekins or cups. Allow to cool. 

**Optional:** Before serving, whisk the reserved eggwhites with the cornstarch slurry and a pinch of cream of tartar until they are at soft peaks (cornstarch will prevent the meringue from sweating if it sits out for awhile). Add the remaining 100g of caster sugar slowly while whisking. Bring to stiff peaks. Place a dollop on top of the curd and and hit with a blowtorch to brown the meringue. Be really careful if doing this in plastic serving dishes. It may also be a good idea to use pasteurized eggs if you take this route. </TEXT>

Can they be dried? Can I freeze them?

After getting frustrated by reading people who placed their orders a week ago get ship dates a month sooner than me, I called amazon to find out what was going on. Apparently their order systems are overloaded and aren't really built to handle this sort of massive backorder. They're working to resolve it, but if you ordered in the past 2 weeks your shipping time may be off quite a bit. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey everyone. I really want to take a stab at a kit guitar to get started. I've been looking at Blues Creek guitar kits, and they seem to have fantastic support.

I know I need to get some hand tools, but the one thing I am most concerned about is either buying or building a binding jig. Is this necessary? I'm trying to make my first build as affordable as possible because there's a good chance I'll cock it up somehow :)

Are there any other required tools that I really need to get started? I know i need to get a jigsaw - I have a tablesaw to build some of the jigs if necessary (even if they won't be beautiful). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> First, I'll probably get rated down for this, but frankly my karma is skyhigh and I really don't care.

Is anyone else a bit frustrated with how this rollout is going? I ordered as soon as I realized an invite was available to me (it went into my spam bucket for a few days), and was given an estimate of May 27th to July 2nd. Now, I see posts [like this](http://www.reddit.com/r/amazonecho/comments/2ygdx9/question_about_wait_time_for_echo_invite/) that show an estimate from May 20th to June 15th. I placed my order on January 12th. Why the hell is a user who ordered a week ago receiving a unit ahead of me?

Last night there was a post that Amazon is [making refurb units available](http://www.reddit.com/r/amazonecho/comments/2zn7s4/fyi_refurbished_units_are_available_for/) but there are still tons of users who haven't even gotten new units yet.

If they have refurb units available, why aren't they making it an option for users who have been waiting for months now? Especially when they're going to let new buyers seemingly get bumped to the head of the line.

On top of it, when I and another user "dared" to comment on that thread about how it was frustrating, we both got downvoted to hell.

This rollout is incredibly frustrating, and it seems like people on this sub are perfectly happy to downvote anyone who mentions it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, that's basically how it tastes. It's an interesting cheese because unlike most other cheeses that are made from curd, gjetost is made by simmering leftover whey down for hours until it turns to sludge. The caramel flavor and sweetness comes from the whey caramelizing. It should be sliced really thin. It goes great on crackers or with toast for breakfast, but I'm a cheese geek, lol.

If you don't have it, see if you can get a copy of the Fannie Farmer Cookbook (or if you're really lucky, a copy of the Boston School of Cooking Cookbook - they're the same thing, but the Boston one is the much older name).

Another thing you could try - see if there are any library or charity book sales in the area. A lot of times you can find tons of cookbooks for cheap - you can grab a bunch and see if any tickle his fancy. </TEXT>

Seriously though, it goes excellent in soup. Make some chicken broth and bring it to a simmer. Slice escarole into 1/4 inch strips and add into broth (you can also wilt it in another pan, but meh to extra dishes). Season with salt and pepper.

If you want to go really fancy, you can add some pasta, chunk up some parmesean/ramano rinds, and small parbroiled meatballs (place them under a broiler for about 1-2 minutes, not long) to your soup. You'll have essentially created a very simple italian wedding soup. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Your recipe seems correct. However you are missing one last step - you have to "fluff" couscous after you have cooked it. Take a fork (or rice paddle) or two and start to toss it around in the bowl and then transfer to another container. 

If it seems really dry, you can boil more liquid and pour it into the couscous and re-cover for a few more minutes. Then fluff again. This becomes important when you're making really large amounts of it (like if you are using it to stuff a crown rack or something) because the ratios get weird.

It's really easy stuff to work with. Try not to overthink it :) </TEXT>

Honestly, a lot of it comes down to semantic arguments. There were gas chambers. They were used. People were gassed to death. Whether it was carbon monoxide or HCN, it doesn't really matter. Fact is, folks were murdered en masse.

Edit: Interesting - it looks like both were used. Auschwitz/Birkenau used HCN, most of the others used exhaust. I guess it really supports the reputation of auschwitz being a death factory :( </TEXT>
