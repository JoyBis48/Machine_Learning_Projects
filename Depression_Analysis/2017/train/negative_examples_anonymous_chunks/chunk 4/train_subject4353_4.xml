	<TEXT> I've only gone primarily mid lane eve this patch. Her clears are just too painful, and she doesn't really benefit from any other jungle items. (Devourer is nice, but farming the stacks isn't effective on her.) 


BOTRK is absolute core on her. It increases her burst significantly, and gives her strong sustained damage and sticking potential. Manamune helps with her mana problems (you can't consistently use your passive in lane), plus it gives a massive damage increase when it's it's completed. You then have a choice between IBG or Triforce next, 90% of the time I go iceborn, as you often need that little extra tankyness to survive teamfights. From there it's more situational, but I usually go banshees, and I often pick up a last whisper as the majority of your damage is physical. Boots are an odd choice, as literally every single boot in the game will work on you. I often go Mercs, but I think sorcerer shoes might be better due to it giving a large damage increase on your R and Q. Take a couple points in Q for easier farming/harass then max E </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've found success with BOTRK, Muramana, IBG/Tri, Banshees, and either last whisper or another tanky item (depending on how you're playing her). The last whisper may sound odd, but the vast majority of her burst will come from her E and the autos after that, so the armor pen makes it a good pick up. Muramana helps with her early mana problems, and gives her the most burst +sustained damage out of any other item in the game, at the cost of a slower ramp-up time. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey man, try solo lane assassin evelynn, I've been stomping with it since last patch. You can go mid for the better roaming, or top for the better matchups. Your main build is BOTRK, Muramana, and IBG (you can go Triforce for more damage if you want). A Ult-E-Auto-Q-Auto will blow up a squishy in under a second. It's actually ridiculous. Take 2-3 points in Q for better farming/harass in lane, and then max E. </TEXT>

(Tri for more damage, iceborn for stickiness and being more tanky). You completely delete squishies in under a second with a ult-E-Q plus a couple autos. You are also a strong splitpusher, (over 2.0 attack speed with BOTRK and maxed E, plus sheen procs and waveclear). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's a combination of high damage, and gapclosers/sticking potential. Give two early kills to an akali/riven, and they can just jump on you and 100/0 you anytime you go near them. They can just go around and kill anybody they want. Meanwhile, getting two kills on someone like a orianna or Karthus won't let you snowball as hard as you can't force your advantage like you can on Fiora or Katarina. And champions like rammus or nautilus don't have the same damage output as the aforementioned champions, so even though they can push their advantage, odds are the enemy will be able to make it to their turret, or escape in other ways before you can kill them. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hey summonerschool. As you may know, evelynn is getting a buff next patch to have on-hit effects apply on each strike of her E. I have a couple questions on how various items would effect it.

1. Would ravenous hydra's cleave (passive) damage apply to the target hit? Since its not considered a basic attack, I wonder if the target hit would take any damage from the hydra itself.

2. Would muramana proc 4 times? Muramana currently procs twice on her E, due to it being a single target ability with two strikes. With it applying on-hit effects, would it now proc 4 times? or is it restricted somehow?

Thanks! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> (This is single target build)

Her lvl 18 base AD is 106. With 2.0 attack speed that is 212 dps.

Devourers will be at around 100 stacks by full build. That is another 200 dps.

Wits end gives 42 magic damage on hit. 84 DPS

Her E + nashors gives 75 magic damage on hit before ratios. 150 dps

With rabadons, void staff, and nashors you should be at 351 ap. .4 of that is 140. 280 dps.

212+200+84+280+150= 926 damage per second. Close enough. 

With a hurricane you will have even higher attack speed, but you'll do slightly less damage, to multiple targets.

EDIT: forgot to add E base damage beforehand.

	<TEXT> I've had some experience as AP bruiser Cho vs gnar, he is fairly annoying due to his mobility and kiting in mini form. However, if you rush double Doran rings, you can harass him very hard with your W. Odds are you aren't going to be able to hit many Q's against him, but at 6 you can occasionally try when he is committing to a cs. He's so squishy in early mini form that you can 70-0 him if you land your Q (You'll most likely have to flash to get on him). Gnar is also not amazing at farming under his tower in mini form, so if you know it's clear you can shove him under and harass him for every cs. Just take care as if a jungler ganks you are basically screwed when you try to waddle away. Admittedly full tank cho would have a much harder lane . </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Vlad is strong late game due to having high AOE damage, on low
cooldowns. He also has an is deceptively tanky due to his passive, and is basically impossible to kill until he gets 3 spell rotations off (REQ-Pool-EQ-Zhonyas-EQ.) His ult also gives a quite large damage increase for his entire team if he lands a good ult. If he can get to the back like, he can blow up the ADC and APC, and still be basically full health. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Adc Ahri. You have a good auto attack range, passable attack speed scaling, and insane kiting/self peel ability. You build much like Corki, with the Triforce rush. You have a crazy good mid-game, and can snowball like crazy. With a sheen you can basically take half an ADC's health with just a Q auto. A hit charm is a guaranteed kill in lane with your ult up. You fall off fairly hard late game damage wise (like all Triforce ADC's though), but you make up for it by being incredibly safe, so while your dps might not be as high, you should be able to actually attack more often. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hang in there man, about a month ago I was in b4 too. Now I'm in silver 3 and still climbing. Just keep focusing on improving, and find a champion that can A) hard carry games B) Can punish opponents mistakes C) You love playing. All I mean by this criteria is that while someone like Nunu, Lulu, Mundo, etc. might be fun to play, odds are you can't carry a bot lane that gave up 5 kills to a Lucian at the 10 minute mark.

For me those champions were Irelia, Nocturne, and Kassadin (For top, jungle, and mid respectively)  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The buffs don't fix what made him considered a weak pick just last patch, rather they help his already strong late game. While the dragon and baron buffs help, the odds are the team that has a rumble sitting on a haunting guise, or a gnar with a brutalizer, will win every early dragon fight compared to the team with a Jax with a sheen. The new turrets do make it harder to dive the enemy laner, and the majority of the picks now are safe enough to avoid it in the first place. Jax is one of my favorite champions, and I'm happy to see him back. I just don't see what makes him a priority blind pick now. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I haven't been able to watch any of the competitive games for 4.21, but I have noticed from the game threads that jax seems to be becoming a very popular pick again. I understand he got some slight buffs, but those don't make up for his previous weaknesses that caused him to fall out of favor ( mostly his weak early game). He should be getting bullied by the meta top laners (gnar, lissandra, rumble) plus he is also a late game champ, with a weaker teamfight, in a mid-game teamfight focused meta. Splitpushing is also not as effective a strategy compared back to when he was in his heyday. Could someone explain why he rose again in popularity? </TEXT>
