	<TEXT> Transformers - I've been reading the current comic series and it's actually quite thought-provoking and very interesting. The films are anything but.

Also, not a big fan of Looper, I found it a bit slow and the mechanics of time-travel didn't really sit well with me. I also had a hard time agreeing with a lot of the characters were doing a lot of the time. I can see why a lot of people like it though.

Funny, I just criticised one movie, by saying I'd prefer it to be thought-provoking Sci-Fi, then proceed to criticise a movie that was exactly that. </TEXT>

Is it the dated style of filmmaking, the clunky dialogue or the iffy acting?*

	<TEXT> For me it's Lord of the Rings.

Here's why:

* The characters are uninteresting and dull (with the exception of Boromir).

* There's way too many characters. It wasn't hard to follow, I just didn't want to.

* (Only really a problem with the Fellowship) The first one seemed to be aimed at young children with lots of childish jokes and dumb slapstick and dialogue - which then seemed really odd because of some of the darker things in that movie.

* The action is really boring. I spent so much time waiting for something interesting, but it never came.

* It's so slow and so long. There's just so much that doesn't need to be there (like the last 40 minutes of RotK). You could say these moments enhance the world, but it already is so rich and vast those moments just drag.

* The lack of an interesting villain. I don't even know why I should care at times.

* The plot revolves around a MacGuffin and is full of Deus ex Machinas (an army of ghosts? WTF?).

* Too much exposition. 

* Too many subplots that just don't matter to me. Why should I care if Aragon found love or didn't or whatever? I don't care about Aragon.

* There isn't actually that much plot there. Just look at how little Sam and Frodo's story progresses from the end of the Fellowship to their encounter with Gollem in RotK. If you cut out all of their story up to that point, you could still follow along just fine.

	<TEXT> More female Superheroes, so probably White Tiger, Spider-Woman and Ms Marvel.

I'd add a few YA movies like The Runaways and Young Avengers. I know a lot of people think The Runaways would work better as a TV series, I'd prefer to see a female-led franchise on film.

I wouldn't hire D.B. Weiss and David Benioff to write Inhumans as this season of Game of Thrones has proved they're not very creative.

I'd introduce Dick Rider in an Annihilation movie.

I'd try and make the movies have more personal and emotional climaxes. I'm not interested if Spider-Man ends with him beating Doc Ock and winning, what made the end of Spider-Man 2 interesting was Doc Ock's sacrifice.

I'd make every sequel a team-up movie a la The Winter Soldier. How cool would Doctor Strange is Spider-Man 2 be? Or Black Panther in Thor: Ragnarok?

Hawkeye miniseries based on Fraction's run.

And of course, Dark Reign and Seige must happen.  </TEXT>
