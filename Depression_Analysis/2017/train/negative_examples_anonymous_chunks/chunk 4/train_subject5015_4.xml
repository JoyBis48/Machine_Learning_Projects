Also, can I see your Widow fit? I'm training up for one now :D. </TEXT>

And Jim's reply

They're apparently upholding a copyright claim that prevents him from monetizing it.

	<TITLE> WB Games has DMCA'd multiple Shadow of Mordor YouTube videos, including the work of Jim Sterling. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-10-01 18:18:58 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> TotalBiscuit explains (possibly) why here: http://www.twitlonger.com/show/ngk4v1 

Tl;dr; looks murky because they only gave out pre-release codes to people they sponsored, but the DMCA claim makes it look like WB Games registered the cutscenes with Content ID, and they're being taken down autotmatically.

Although this is still only speculation as to why the videos were taken down, I don't think we can know exactly if they were DMCA'd manually, or be Content ID. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> From what i've read that dosen't matter because the essence or the "heart" of my video was contained in that 7 seconds. 

http://youtube.com/yt/copyright/fair-use.html#yt-copyright-four-factors

http://publishing.wsu.edu/copyright/fair_use/ (See Amount of the Material Copied.)

The precendant for that 1% was set by  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wright_v._Warner_Books , but that was in conjunction with the fact that it was an educational piece. 

I'd appriciate if you could come up with a source.

Edit: Not only that, but 1% of 174 seconds (the length of his video) is 1.74. seconds. My clip was 7 seconds long. </TEXT>

The only thing's I care about is this:

He made no attempt to contact me. He had to have downloaded and reuploaded the video, hence the shitty quality. I could have even provieded him with a clean copy through something like dropbox, but he's too big to care I guess.

He's monetising my content, making a shit ton of money through my video, with zero credit. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [Suggestion] Player made clothing </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I just read the devlog and Garry stated how he liked creating the tool for the clothes previewing and disliked not many people using it. This lead me to thinking about something lke what Valve has to implement player made gun/clothing models. 

Possibly we could have something like that, something that goes through a strenuous review process then gets added to the game. Alternatively something that just allows for a server to install a limited ammount of extra textures, a la modding. 

At least then the tool's he creates for the devs will reach more people (don't get me wrong though, the usage of the tools is an extension of the whole modding/community created content, not the other way round).

This is still a really open ended idea, and i'd love to hear peoples thoughts on it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not sure why people are saying this is impossible. A possible vector of attack includes, for example, impersonating someone that got something wrong. "I sent you x, but really meant to send you y. My boss has been on my ass all day, would you mind changing it really quickly for me?". 

Most techniques like this require inside information into how they run things. What lingo do they use? How do they use it? Possibly you're an intern who dosen't know what they're doing.

 The bottom line is, impersonate someone in their chain of command, then use empathy or fear to get them to do shit for you. If you're looking for straight up SE discussion you might be better off in /r/realsocialengineering , generally people care less about morals or why you're doing something over there. </TEXT>
