In the United States, thousands of wildlife crossings have been built in the past 30 years, including culverts, bridges, and overpasses. These have been used to protect Mountain Goats in Montana, Spotted Salamanders in Massachusetts, Bighorn Sheep in Colorado, Desert Tortoises in California, and endangered Florida Panthers in Florida. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is really true. I always find that if I can get off to a good start in the morning, the rest of the day takes care of itself.

I also think it's a good idea to get as much done the night before to make the morning easier. I always make my lunch, pack my bag, and lay my clothes out at night. That way in the morning I'm not rushing to get everything ready. I just grab my stuff and go.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I totally second this. If I don't stick to a routine every time I work from home, it just falls apart pretty quickly. "Just 15 minutes" of video games/reddit/distractions quickly turns into hours.

So just like u/arrant_pedantry said, I just automatically wake up, run, shower, and then sit down with my computer in a room without a TV and start cranking out work.  </TEXT>

I've seen the physical copy that has all three games (2, 3, and 4) but when I go to the Xbox site or get on Xbox live, it only has an option with two games (and Peace Walker as a separate game):
