	<TEXT> I have only been in Dubrovnik so far but I am going to Split next Tues. So far Dubrovnik is one of the most beautiful places i have been too with loads to do and I have only been here for three days. The city has a massive hill to the left and beautiful sea and islands to the right so gives it a look that is very hard to find in other scenery's. It is also very cheap over here as well so would highly recommend it for travelling. I could message you when I get to Split and let you know how it is over there if you would like? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah her character is meant too be unattractive by Westoros standards. She is in fact really thin, with a soft spoken British accent and so friendly. Yeah she is about 6"3. When we saw her we double taked as she did not look like Brienne apart from the height but she is really tall. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It is one of the most beautiful cities I have ever been too. Once you get past the loads of locations they use for GoT, there is still plenty more architecture, history and natural beauty to admire. I really recommend it and it is quite cheap.  </TEXT>
