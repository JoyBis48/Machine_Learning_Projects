	<TEXT> I post this article to stir discussion. I do not agree with the author on everything in this story.

I take particular objection to the authors assessment of seasoned journalists. We are not lazy nor hacks. There are good and bad journalists of all ages. Flat out statements about the abilities or inabilities of older journalists are ageist.

	<TEXT> From Wikipedia about Byrd's record after his vote on the 1964 Civil Rights Act:

For the 20032004 session, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP)[62] rated Byrd's voting record as being 100 percent in line with the NAACP's position on the 33 Senate bills they evaluated. 16 other senators received that rating. In June 2005, Byrd proposed an additional $10 million in federal funding for the Martin Luther King, Jr. National Memorial in Washington, D.C., remarking that, "With the passage of time, we have come to learn that his Dream was the American Dream, and few ever expressed it more eloquently."
