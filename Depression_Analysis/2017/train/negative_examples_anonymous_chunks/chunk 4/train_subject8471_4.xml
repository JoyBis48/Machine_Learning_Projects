	<TEXT> This woman goes into a funeral home to make arrangements 
for her husband's funeral.  She tells the director that 
she wants her husband to be buried in a dark blue suit.

He asks, "Wouldn't it just be easier to bury him in the
black suit that he's wearing?"

But she insists that it must be a blue suit and gives
him a blank check to buy one.

When she comes back for the wake, she sees her husband
in the coffin and he is wearing a beautiful blue suit.
She tells the director how much she loves the suit and
asks how much it cost. He says, "Actually, it didn't
cost anything.  The funniest thing happened.  As soon
as you left, another corpse was brought in, this one
wearing a blue suit.  I noticed that they were about
the same size, and asked the other widow if she would
mind if her husband were buried in a black suit.  She
said that was fine with her. So... I switched the heads" </TEXT>

March 18, 2008

Trees talk to each other at night.

All fish are named either Lorna or Jack.

Before your eyeballs fall out from watching too much TV, they get very loose.

Tiny bears live in drain pipes.

If you are very very quiet you can hear the clouds rub against the sky.

The moon and the sun had a fight a long time ago.

Everyone knows at least one secret language.

When nobody is looking, I can fly.

We are all held together by invisible threads.

Books get lonely too.

Sadness can be eaten.

I will always be there. </TEXT>
