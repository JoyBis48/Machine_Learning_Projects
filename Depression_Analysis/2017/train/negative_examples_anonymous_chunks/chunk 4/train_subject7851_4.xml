Reddit is tiny as it can be and none of these decisions are made without C-Level involved.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> BBQ Ribs. Some soy (tbsp per 2 lbs  5g net carbs), honey (1 tbsp per 2 lbs  10g of net carbs). Smoked paprika, garlic and a smidgen of cumin. If you're feeling naughty, 1 tbsp of liquid smoke.

Total carbs under 10 grams per lbs of ready product (most of it will drain off or burn off).

Let it marinate. And then either in the slow cooker or on the bbq for quite a bit of time. Awesome. Next to no carbs, still a sweet taste. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think you've been living under a rock. Most of their services and products are top notch now.

Surface tablets are incredible. Windows Phone is actually working very well (albeit with a small app store). Holo lens is the same as black magic. XBOne, like it or not, is very good (then again, so is the PS4), Outlook.com works well. OneDrive is better than most alternatives. Office is still king in both home user and corporate environments and works very well next to it being industry standard. On top of that, Windows has been very stable for the past few years and besides thinking that a mobile inspired UI would work on desktops (later fixed) I have very little qualms about it. At least it's more innovative than regurgitating OSX iterations. </TEXT>

Then again, I am much more proficient in doing stuff in the Windows 7 control settings than in the OSX settings.

Might be preference, who knows, to each their own. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Actually according to Dante the most "terrible" hell is pretty much an ice lake.

 Ninth Circle (Treachery)
 The ninth and last circle is ringed by classical and Biblical giants, who perhaps symbolize pride and other spiritual flaws lying behind acts of treachery.[55] The giants are standing on a ledge above the ninth circle of Hell,[56] so that from the Malebolge they are visible from the waist up. They include Nimrod, Ephialtes (who with his brother Otus tried to storm Olympus during the Gigantomachy), Briareus, Tityos, and Typhon. The giant Antaeus (being the only giant unbound with chains) lowers Dante and Virgil into the pit that forms the ninth circle of Hell (Canto XXXI).
 
 The traitors are distinguished from the "merely" fraudulent in that their acts involve betraying a special relationship of some kind. There are four concentric zones (or "rounds") of traitors. These rounds correspond, in order of seriousness, to betrayal of family ties, betrayal of community ties, betrayal of guests, and betrayal of liege lords. **In contrast to the popular image of Hell as fiery, the traitors are frozen in a lake of ice known as Cocytus, with each group encased in ice to progressively greater depths**.
