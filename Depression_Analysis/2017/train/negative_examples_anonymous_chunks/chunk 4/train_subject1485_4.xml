	<TEXT> What the hell does retiring or standing down have to do with representing one's constituents in Parliament. Either they're people's MP or they're not. Are you saying they get to stop early becasue they're not after people's vote next time and so don't have to do their job properly? They should be supporting shared parenting becasue it's the right thing to do, not just to get votes.

I suppose you make a fair point about minister's sometimes tending not to sign, though in most cases the sexism accusations still stand for those MPs, particularly Lynne and Lorely (and increasingly so for Jo too). Lynne has a very long history of terrible sexism against men and it's a scandal she's ever been allowed near any equalities position given her obvious contempt for half the population. How often did you actually see her actually do her job and pushed for shared parenting (or for any significant equal rights for men and boys for that matter). I hear that Lorely is quite the sexist too, with Jo now also getting in on the action and actually campaigning against any progress toward equality when it doesn't benefit women: http://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/womens-life/9764984/Womens-very-unfair-Christmas-present-car-insurance-price-hike.html </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  This is an issue that disproportionately affects men, so it is unsurprising to me that it would attract proportionally more male signatories.

Except we're told that the reason we need female MPs is that they'll all be far less macho, and instead of focusing on big engineering schemes and the military, they'll push for equality and for breaking down gender roles. Thus, were the female MPs to act as we were todl they would, then their support for shared parenting woudl be significantly igher than the support from men.

Furthermore, this is not simply a men's issue. Child are damaged hugely by a lack of relationship with their fathers (both boys and girls), and wrongly exclusing the father from a child's life almost always goes in hand with excluding grandparents, uncles and aunts etc

Anyway, thanks for checking the stats, there seems to have been a rounding error and so 12 looks to be the correct figure. (BTW  60% represents how many extra female MPs would have been needed were the number of male supporters adjusted downwards - i.e. if the 104 figure was fixed) </TEXT>

	<TEXT>   the fact of the matter is that vast majority of domestic violence is male to female

Utter nonsense, literally hundreds to studies show gender symmetry in terms of perpetration of domestic violence. Yes a lot more males abusers are found in police statistics, but that's simply due to the failure to seek out, report and arrest females perpetrators. When you actually look at more reliable indicators such as crime surveys you find huge numbers of male victims and female perpetrators.

http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.372.5578 rep=rep1 type=pdf

To further emphasise just how false your remark is, just think about all differnet types of domestic violence out there that we ignore. For example there's domestic violence against children, a notable aspect of which is the tendency of mothers to abuse boys much more than girls. also think about homosexual relationship, which many studies note are the most violent of any type. The idea that domestic violence is almost always men abusing women is quite simply a lie. </TEXT>

What we have is a set of laws that refuses to protect innocent male babies from dangerous, non-consesnual and irreversible mutilation, with such barbaric practices even funded and supported by the taxpaer! On the other hand, the same laws are  over-protective of females to such an extent that the laws becomes concerned with mere piercings on consenting adults.

It's obvious that males are subject to extreme discrimination by the government, yet the BBC has to pretend it's females are the victims despite the reverse obviously being the case. </TEXT>

For a start you can share J4M B links and videos, follow them on Twitter and retweet them. Comments on articles about J4M B help too.

Donations from abroad are also permitted just as long as they're not thousands and thousands of pounds.

Feedback is good too, for example you can suggest improvements and submit better academic sources for any weaker parts of the Manifesto.

They don't' even have a Wikipedia article yet either so perhaps someone could help with that also. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not familiar with Symantec's politics, although I found one person involved to be a feminist (though she was only responsible for defending the sexism and not in charge of the actual filter technology).

It does occasionally block really extreme feminist sites, though generally it does seem that the "hate" classification gets triggered by  the transphobic content on those sites and it generally doesn't appear to be programmed to block  sites containing hate speech directed at men. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I saw that censorship of men's human rights sites was a hot topic right now so best re-post some of my investigative work into the matter. I wrote this article over two years ago but it's all still 100% accurate today becasue nothing has changed, 

I'm probably the foremost expert on the censoring of men's human rights sites by web filters and I've written 5 or 6 articles investigating exactly what's going on and which companies use the filters.

I'll share more of those articles later or others are free to post them. If anyone has any questions on this issue I'll be able to answer most of them fairly easily and accurately.

Some further reading of my research into the matter:

	<TEXT> Hi, I've written more about the blocking of men's human rights sites than probably anyone else out there.

There are actually quite a few school who use the Symantec filtering system. It blocks men's human rights sites as "hate sites" so your school is probably better than a lot of others and at least only censoring instead of also defaming organisations. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The Bloodstained Men are a excellent and extremely long running intactivist group who campaign against male genital mutilation in America.

They're great at raising awareness and confronting those performing and endorsing MGM. They're targeting the north-east this year due to it's higher than average rates of MGM (over 70%!) so its' really important to challenge attitudes in such states in order to protect children from this form of abuse.

A few videos of them in action for those who haven't seen them yet:

* [Protest in Denver] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSsdPE4AC0g)
* [Interesting exchange in Tuscaloosa, Alabama] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-PujOfGYZ8)
* [Protest at the AAP convention in San Diego] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGPu4jB_L2g)


They're looking to raise $5K and at the time of making this post they are at $2,140, here's the donation page:

http://www.youcaring.com/nonprofits/help-fund-the-2015-northeast-bloodstained-men-tour/294627

These guys work hard and have even been wrongly arrested while protesting, so they deserve our full support.

	<TEXT> Any supposed benefits of MGM will never outweigh the risks and harm caused. It's obvious that important body parts should never be amputated unless they are diseased or damaged beyond repair.

Butchering kids genitals just for the hell of it and without their consent is sickening child sex abuse. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I too was suspicious about the likelihood of a genuinely right-wing party proposing such a thing, and it's actually almost completely false to categorise this party as right-wing. It was true at one time, but according to Wikipedia they've shifted over the last decade from being right-wing towards the center:

 "Under the leadership of Jyrki Katainen, chairman from 2004 to 2014, the National Coalition Party shifted from a socially conservative, neoliberal party of the upper class towards a socially liberal, centre-right catch-all party.[8][9] It is now moderately liberal and reformist,[10] and supports, among other things, multiculturalism[11] and same sex marriage.[12"
