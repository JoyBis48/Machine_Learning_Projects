That seems quite optimal and I hope other OEMs follow that. Unfortunately even if they do it, it will only be for high-end devices. That's why Google still needs to push a plan to update *all* devices, at the very least for security updates if not features. </TEXT>

WP users should be the most upset about that, as they'll be lied for years more by Microsoft that the company will totally continue to support the platform, while in reality it will focus more on Android and iOS and starve Windows Phone/Mobile of development resources, until it goes out with a whimper rather than a bang.

I just feel it's very dishonest and unfair to do that to current *and future* Windows mobile users by misleading them this way. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Intel still has a lot of "x86 baggage". You know how we can find that out? It's easy.

ARM chips:

1) cost less per die area

2) same performance or better (usually better) at high-end for instance, or mid-range or whatever level you want to compare

3) yet they are like 1-2 process nodes *behind* Intel's process nodes.

How is it possible for ARM chips to cost significantly less, have at least as much performance at a given level, and yet do all that on a 1-2 generations old process node? It's possible because Intel's chips are bloated. 

If Intel would put the latest high-end ARM core on its own 14nm process and compare it with latest Atom, at the same power envelope, it wouldn't even be close. The ARM core would be like 2x faster, while still costing half as much. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not really. Intel is not competitive on a "performance per price" metric. Not even close. The only way it has been able to *look* like it's competitive on that metric so far is because it would heavily subsidize its chips with profits from the PC chip business.

Now they've said they won't do that anymore, but it will be hard to verify since they've just unified the 2 divisions (mobile and PC). However, there was already an announcement that for the next version or something of the Zenfone 2, Asus would use a *lower performance* Snapdragon 615. 

Why? Because Intel is not selling that Atom or its successor at the *same price level as the Snapdragon 615* as it's doing now. So if Intel raises its prices, Asus can't sell a "mid-range phone with a high-end chip" for $250 anymore. It will have to buy a mid-range chip for a *real* price, not a subsidized one.

And if Intel has to compete with other high-end chips in high-end phones with real prices, it loses, because high-end Arm chips like the Snapdragon 820 for instance will have better performance for *half the price* of a high-end Atom (Cherrywell or whatever they are calling the new one). </TEXT>

Lol, I like how the H-series is now "high-performance".

Even without that, they could just ask for a "bigger budget" for some *other programs* in the future (without actually telling the whole Congress what they are - after all even the Intelligence Committee doesn't know about most of them, as per Dianne Feinstein) and then use that budget to restart it under some other name and authorization. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> How many times have they "closed" programs in the past, only to rename them to something else and not only keep doing it, but *expanding* it.

Room 641a (AT T cable tapping) comes to mind where they got "caught", promised to shutter it, and yet the Snowden revelations show us that they have *cable access* to *all* traffic in the US.

Anyway, this isn't even their largest program - not even close. The Patriot Act accounts to less than 5% of their mass spying. The rest is done through the FISA Amendments Act Section 702 (bound for renewal in 2018 I think) and the Executive Order 12333.

The Patriot Act Section 215 was *mainly* about phone records (although they probably interpreted it to mean Internet records too in some cases), but the FAA 702 and EO1233 allows them to capture *all web traffic*, including content, which also includes your Skype calls, emails, SMS, chats and so on. Those are far my dangerous than the Patriot Act 215. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If *it is* because something like this, they probably wouldn't want to tell us anyway, because that would show how reckless and incompetent the airline companies were to connect the entertainment systems to the critical systems, even if there is a "firewall" between them (because hackers have never bypassed those before...).

This is precisely what worries me *greatly* about "smart" cars and self-driving cars. If the companies don't *completely* separate the two types of systems through an air gap, and give *absolutely no network connection* to the critical system, we could see a lot of hacks happening, even mid-driving.

 The "no network access" part probably won't happen, though, as with self-driving cars they will be pushing V2V technology, which means for it to be effective the critical system that includes breaks and engine and whatnot will need to communicate with that network. But at least I hope they put the two systems on *different chips*. 

Make no mistake, though, the vast majority of "self-driving car accidents" won't happen because the self-driving AI is not good enough. They'll happen because of hacks into people's cars. 

Combine that with virtually unaccountable spy agencies (not just US, but everywhere) and that future is quite terrifying indeed, considering we only know about most of their hacks from a whistleblower, not because they were *detected* after the fact. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What are the most likely battery technologies to succeed in the next 5-10 years, though?

From what I've read there are [quite](http://www.forbes.com/sites/aarontilley/2015/01/28/your-smartphone-battery-sucks-this-mit-startup-could-change-that/) a few [startups](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/secretive-company-claims-battery-breakthrough/) that promise to "commercialize solid state batteries" by 2018. Both [Apple](http://revolution-green.com/solid-state-batteries-apple-and-toyotas-next-big-thing/) and [Google](http://www.slashgear.com/google-is-working-on-solid-state-batteries-that-last-longer-than-typical-batteries-12378543/) also seem to be researching them and Apple wants to launch its electric car in 2020 or so. 

Solid state batteries also seem to have 50-100% higher density (up to 1200Wh/liter) than regular li-ion batteries, higher life cycles, and they are safer too (due to lack of liquid electrolyte), which could be great for electric cars.

I can't find the link now but there was some li-ion Nobel prize winner or something also working on solid state batteries. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm inclining more and more to believe that Tor needs to become P2P where everyone is an exit node.

That seems to have worked pretty well for torrenting/piracy. Imagine if torrents didn't work the way they do now and only a few "special" nodes would upload the content to others. That would make those targets much more appealing to law enforcement and seeders wouldn't be able to "hide within the masses" as they do now.

This has turned out to be such an insurmountable probable for the anti-piracy guys that they just prefer to focus on other *centralized* places such as websites that keep the torrents.

So we already have proof that such a P2P strategy "works", despite the fear of many that they don't want "all the illegal stuff" to go through their computers. 

Also, perhaps the client could make everyone an exit node by default, but somewhere deep in the settings it could still allow people to disable their client from being an exit node and make it only a relay node. Then those who are really terrified about the prospect of being an exit node can just turn that off. Win-win right?

The current strategy of having a few thousand nodes will never work, and it's only going to become worse as NSA increases its budget and capabilities. Those thousand nodes will be overwhelmed by NSA's own nodes.

Even if we turn millions of relay nodes into exit nodes I'd still worry the NSA has the capability to mess with that, but at least it would be a much smaller chance. Also, if Tor ever gets to something like 100 million users (you never know, especially with more oppressive countries going online in the next decade) that should make it almost impossible for any agency to cryptanalize the Tor traffic - but only if we make everyone an exit node. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm saying support for obsolete protocols should be *dropped* at some point (in this case by browser vendors, but it could be OpenSSH maintainers, and so on). Those who drop it should announce ahead of time, but after that it's everyone else's responsibility.

If as you say the problem is some incompetent IT admin configured the security to use an old protocol and didn't pay attention to the latest security news, then eventually he should notice that his sites just stop working. However that *didn't happen*, for example in the case of 512-bit DHE, which should've been dropped a *long time ago*. 

People in charge of security at browser vendors decided to "be easy" on the incompetent IT admins and leave 512-bit DHE in there for another 10 years, even if it could be broken with a few PCs. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What bothers me most about decisions such as "Well, we can't dump this protocol yet because 30% of the servers still use it" is that they don't also present a deadline for when they'll stop supporting that protocol.

Fine, keep 1024-bit DHE support now. But where's the deadline for when you'll drop it? Maybe they didn't want to rush such a decision and perhaps we'll still see Google announce a plan like they did for SHA1.

However, I really do believe that's how the security industry needs to think from now on. Will a protocol start to look weak in 5 years? Prepare a 3 year plan to get everyone off it. Is the protocol *already too weak* to be considered very secure? Create an even more aggressive plan to phase it out. 

This kind of mentality needs to permeate everything security related on the web from now on. No more using 2 decades old broken crypto because it just happened to remain in the software and nobody bothered to push it out "because it might break some things". That excuse would not be valid if the security industry was a little more pro-active. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, because we're just going to build 100,000 robots, send them to a war zone and say..."Uh...so do what you guys do best...alert us when you're done. "

Or option 2) we're still going to control the robots by giving them the algorithms which they're supposed to use to kill people (kind of like how the CIA kills people now with drones based on NSA's metadata/SIM card location information).

Which do you think is more likely?

	<TEXT> You might want to take a look at:

https://github.com/ricochet-im/ricochet

https://pond.imperialviolet.org/

Both work only over Tor, but they are still experimental. Otherwise see if you can find something you like here:

https://www.privacytools.io/

And you might want to give Peerio a try. It uses https://minilock.io/ to encrypt everything on the client side, and keeps the data for easy access on Peerio's servers (kind of like Spideroak in that regard, except it's a messaging/email-like client).

On mobile Signal/TextSecure is your best bet. </TEXT>
