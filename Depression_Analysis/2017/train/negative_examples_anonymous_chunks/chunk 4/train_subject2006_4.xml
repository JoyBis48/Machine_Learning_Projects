	<TEXT> There is a [May Festival performance](http://www.mayfestival.com/festival.html) that evening - Wagner and Verdi! Definitely fancy, and great, classic song selections; one of which is the Bridal March, so you know, romantical (if you don't actually pay attention to the plot of the opera.) If you used that in your wedding, it might be double romanticals.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sorry to see a business close its' doors, but I don't think they'll have issues filling the space. Didn't have a great experience there though - it was for a bridal shower and the hostess had reserved their "party room." It was not totally closed off, which was fine, but then they kept seating other patrons in the area, even though the rest of the restaurant was open. Just...odd. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I found an article when [Reggie Sanders charged the mound in 1994](http://articles.latimes.com/1994-04-14/sports/sp-45939_1_perfect-game). I don't have any evidence that this is the most recent occurrence, but that's the latest I've found with minimal research. 

I don't think Choo will though. He seems too even-keeled for that. And I don't think anybody wants another [Carlos Quinten](http://i.imgur.com/kKzlslW). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Almost everyone. Votto and Frazier were definitely there, but they seemed to be only taking pictures with kids. I was standing next to two cute kids, so I was able to take creeper photos. The only players (excluding DL) I didn't see were Heisey and Chapman. And they had said in the invitation that the day's pitcher and catcher wouldn't be out, so no Bailey - though I did get one with Mesoraco! I also got pictures with Paul, Simon, Ondrusek, Broxton, Cingrani, Hannahan, and Robinson. Latos and Arroyo were there too, but I was busy getting another picture and I didn't manage to catch them.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Season tickets! They sent us a invitation/ticket and you had to rsvp. It started at 10:30 before Sunday's game. You entered the park near the bullpen, and could get a spot anywhere around the outfield. Then the players, coaches, and announcers started making their way around! Everyone was really nice. I have others as well - but I only posted the highlight reel.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is going to sound harsh, but don't. Unless they specifically have put out a call for pieces, they don't want to hear from you. Museums and curators get a million calls from people that want them to look at their stuff. And many of you may find it cynical, but we generally don't care unless you are interested in donating it. And half the time not even then. It's an issue of being underfunded and understaffed (a fairly universal problem in the world of non-profit museums) that we just don't have the time to look at everything that comes around. A lot of museum's do have days in which members can bring one or two pieces in to consult with a curator. Think Antique's Roadshow style, where we don't tell you the value. I know some of the auction houses even do it. 

For what it's worth though,  it is a very lovely piece, I just wouldn't bother a museum unless you really want to part with it.
