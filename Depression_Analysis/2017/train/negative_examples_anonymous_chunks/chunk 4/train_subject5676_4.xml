	<TEXT> I love reading! It has always played a massive part in my life. I've been writing a lot since around the age of 15. I am now 18 and I'm editing my first novel.  A good friend of mine is editing helping me and she is overwhelmingly positive. though when I read my work, I find it hard to not compare it to the books that I love, which are always significantly better. I"m wondering if others feel this way about there writing? And if so, how do you approach these feelings?

	<TEXT> I would say don't give up on the idea of survivors if that is what you want, it may seem that there is no way but perhaps there is  a way which will think up while you're in the shower one day. Its always ok to rewrite the ending. Also I think a less depressing kill everyone off would be something whereby everyone devoted their resources to the survival of a specific individual or everyone collectively just sits down in one another's arms and accepts their fate.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you for your honesty. I Think this is a really great example of how a work of fiction can provoke some major change within people and their perceptions of the world.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My Grandfather loved Nevil Shute! I believe they exchanged letters for a small period of time in the late 50s. My grandfather was an engineer as well and would not read any other fiction. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Is there a novel or an author, that you have come across that influenced your life so much that you find it hard to imagine that there was a time before you knew of them? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> For me personally it would be the novels of Aldous Huxley, Disgrace by J.M. Coetzee, and Chuck Palahniuk's Lullaby. All of these have changed the way I see the world and I find it strange, that I once had not been influenced by them. </TEXT>
