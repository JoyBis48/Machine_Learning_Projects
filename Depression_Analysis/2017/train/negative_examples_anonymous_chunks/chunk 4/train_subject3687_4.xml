My husband claims that 100% "pure blood" Native Americans have no facial hair. I've tried arguing that almost no one is "100%" anything but I digress. It appears to be a common stereotype, just one I never heard before him. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I went with minimum required coverage. To save money.
BAM uninsured motorist hit my parked car.
Because I didn't pay the uninsured motorist coverage there was nothing I could do.

The worst part is we called the guy's insurance company and they said he WAS covered only to find out two days later he wasn't. His insurance company wouldn't do shit, my insurance company wouldn't do shit, and it was too late to call the cops.

The good news is the guy is in jail now for a string of like 12 burglaries in the area.
