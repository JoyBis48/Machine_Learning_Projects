	<TEXT> That was nice.  Well I've always heard them in trees, their presence was always known.  I might have seen them in their bright green form, but as for this shit all over my house, I've never seen it.  I've lived in Las Vegas, NV for 15 years.  For the first few years I've lived here, I didn't even know that noise was coming from an insect, I was 13 years old and thought it was electricity of some sort. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This may be TMI.  I have gotten ringworm a couple different times, so  I started to wash my clothes at pretty high temperatures just to kill any germs.  I just feel like the closet and all the clothes in it get so much cleaner.  I know it makes the clothes wear out faster, I do not care. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I saved the documents that another redditor posted a short while ago.  But it's like pdf format and I can't post it. It's pretty crazy that it's not just a single case of him *maybe* hooking up with like, a seventeen year old.  He likes babies.  He finds women that let him do sexual things to their babies.  It's an insane story, look into it. </TEXT>
