	<TEXT> Really loving all the subtle things in this season so far, the zealot in the dish, the cheese throwing, the balance joking (reaper changes, super long range on nexus cannon) Just gives it that little extra! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think Huk and Ret aren't talking about the same thing, huk complains about him getting denied to compete in both code A and WCS NA/EU while players in code S are allowed to do this, Ret is giving his opinion about koreans playing in WCS NA/EU in the first place. 2 very different things </TEXT>

	<TEXT> basically your MMR (the hidden ranking score system blizzard uses) has to be steady in the league you want to get promoted too. What this means: when you face, and win from gold players regularly you will get promoted soon. It can be a bit random sometimes though. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Unranked queue matches vs ranked queue? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> So I (diamond Protoss) just started playing around a bit on the unranked ladder as Zerg (my zerg skills are bronze/silver i think). 
I got matched vs a platinum protoss player and lost quite badly.
after the match i noticed that his league symbol changed to diamond.
So after a quick chat i found out he queued for the ranked ladder, and got promoted to diamond after the match. I think this is a bit unfair. **What do you guys think?**

TL;DR: Opponent gets promoted on the back of my diamond protoss MMR, while I played offrace on the unranked ladder. Fair/unfair? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I used a build like this in WoL a lot, but it indeed does work vs 3 hatch openings in HotS.
I don't have an exact build order, but here is roughly what i do:

FFE, if you can gateway before cannon (scout no early pool)
2 gasses
gateway 100% -- cyber core.
zealot (send to watchtower/third base if you 
chronoboost in probes until cybercore is finished, after that only chrono boost cybercore
+1 att @ 100gas (chrono when you can)
stalker.
3 gates @50% cybercore
stop probe production
3/4/5 more gates
forward pylons
should be hitting around 8:30-9:00 i think.

Hope this helps! </TEXT>
