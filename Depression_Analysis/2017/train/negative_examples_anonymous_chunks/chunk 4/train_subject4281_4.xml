	<TEXT> I had plenty of other fuck ups. I almost didn't graduate Cuz I couldn't throw the practice grenade far enough. Some brave soul let me do a real one anyway and I did just fine.

I overthought everything and was the drill sgts special case Because I always misinterpreted their instructions or struggled with simple tasks like tying my strings up the way they wanted. I was somewhat of a joke for a while but I ended up doing pretty well and passed my MOS school with flying colors </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Can they have books in prison?

Prison gang warfare would be reduced to pen and paper PVP matches.

Maybe I can get some government funding for reducing prison violence and teaching inmates math and leadership  skills.

Fuck if nothing else this sounds like a really fun volunteer idea even if I got no money out of it. 

You could mail the inmates new "content" patches via letters </TEXT>
