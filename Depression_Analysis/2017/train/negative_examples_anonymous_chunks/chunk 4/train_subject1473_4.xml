	<TEXT> On here, we often see creepy old fashioned photos, costumes, clowns, dolls, etc. So what from today will be creepy in the future. My guess is that many attempts during the 1990s up until now of creating realistic CGI humans, such as those in movies such as Polar Express or in some video games will be looked at by our grandchildren 50 years from now the way we look at a vintage doll and call or creepy. I also think that the idea that we used craigslist will creep them out somewhat.  </TEXT>

Interesting how two sets of wording can refer to just about the same question and give readers a different idea/feeling to readers. I probably worded it that way due to how much I am concerned about this and want to drive with the lowest risk of an accident. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So, this is what I have concluded from the more constructive answers here. I should slow down to stop or keep going at the same pace on yellows, depending on where I am on the road. Yellow means anything but "speed up and try to beat the light". Flooring it once and making it through the yellow isn't dangerous, but doing it repeatedly causes red light running since this is nearly impossible to do every time. Using an icon such as road markings to indicate the "point of no return" is very important. I also think part of why I got so many negative responses has to do with my wording. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I wasn't going out of my way to run a red the two times I did, just thought I could make it while it was still yellow because of a lack of experience. We all make mistakes, it's just a matter of how we deal with them and understand the potential repercussions if repeated. I just felt it would help if I admitted here that my driving isn't perfect and needs improvement in the area of choosing to stop or go through the yellow. Just because I did something wrong doesn't make me an idiot. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Any advice on how to break my habit of flooring the gas at yellow lights? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-03-07 02:39:48 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I have developed a bad habit of flooring the gas pedal at yellow lights. So far, it has caused me to run a red light twice. It is something I do out of impulse since I want to go through the light before it turns red, but can tell that it isn't exactly a safe thing to do, especially if I end up running the red. I used to sometimes have a problem with hitting the brakes too hard at the yellow lights but stopped doing that because of all the tailgaters on the road. So far I have only had my license for about six months and this is the only thing about my driving that I currently have a major concern about.

Edit: I was asking for advice other than the obvious "just don't do it". I probably also made this sound worse than it really is. Thanks to all of you who made constructive comments. I will keep those in mind. To everyone who decided to be a flat-out jerk, I could care less about rude, pointless comments made by some stranger on the internet. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Documents and actual events are two seperate things, so I guess you can change a birthdate as much as you can destroy all records of a person, edit them out of photos, and say they never existed (as in Stalin era Nonpersons).

	<TEXT> During 90 days little aging or development happens. A former classmate of mine told me that he came to America with no birth certificate because he was born in a country where a war was taking place and newborn babies were being killed in hospitals. He said that his parents remembered his birthdate and had it printed correctly on the birth certificate he received after immigrating. However, he also said that he had heard stories of other foreign born children, including ones from his own country, who came to the US with no birth certificate whose parents made them 1-2 or more years younger than their actual age, usually with the idea that this would give them an advantage in sports.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I know that your birthdate is the day you were born, but a lot of things are legally one way, but physically another. I would, however, want it to be limited so you can only make yourself 90 days older or 90 days younger, and once every 10 years, so we won't see things like high schoolers making themselves 21. Some people want to get their kids into school earlier, legally do certain things slightly earlier, or just don't like the date of their birthday. I don't see the harm in making oneself slightly younger or older on a piece of paper. This would also be a good way for the government to make some extra money if they charge a fee to do so.

There is also the 1983-87 Continental sedan which is a mid sized car which should get better MPG and has Lincoln looks. It was also available with a BMW diesel engine, though these are rare. The front drive 1990-93 Chrysler Imperial and New Yorker also have pop up headlights, a big grill, and limousine like feel, but are less substantial looking IMO. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> While playing Grand Theft Auto and garaging, as well as customizing and respraying vehicles stolen off the street, I thought about a story my uncle told me years ago. During the early 90's he had a popular late-model luxury car which was stolen and then recovered two weeks later. It came back waxed, washed, and with new tires, brakes, an oil change, and a full tank of gas. The man who stole it had been using it as if it were his own car. He said that this guy thought he would be able to keep the car longer and get away with it. To do this in real life seems pretty dumb, but I guess it can happen. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Will Malaise Era cars go up in value and/or popularity or stagnate at where they are in the future? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-01-11 03:48:47 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> After reading this post I did over a month ago, I have decided that there are two possible scenarios for Malaise Era cars.
http://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/2ftkc9/will_malaise_era_cars_ever_increase_in_value_or/

1. Malaise Era cars other than the ones that are currently obvious collectibles will go up in value/popularity in about 10 years as they become more distinctive from modern cars, 70s-80s imports will go up in value, and they will be discovered by a new audience. Today, a Malaise Era car on the road stands out due to its strong differences from modern cars. Some 70s-80s European and Japanese cars are beginning to go for stupid money, while most Malaise Era cars can still be had for dirt cheap. Some may become the lower priced alternatives, if they aren't already. In ten years, the oldest Malaise Era cars will be 50 years old. That is a long enough time for many of these car's faults to not be well remembered anymore, especially by hipsters who crave borrowed nostalgia for decades they never experienced. They already seem to be becoming surprisingly popular among collectors in Europe. I will also note that I read Hemmings Classic Car which regularly runs articles about domestics of this era.

2. Malaise Era cars other than the obvious collectibles are not fondly remembered by most enthusiasts and will fade into obscurity. A few will be collected by a small cult following, but that is it. When they were new, these weren't the cars that kids of the 70's and 80's wanted, they were mostly what the older generations wanted, so the market for these cars is dying out. They also have already had about 20 years to become top dollar collector's items but haven't. It took about 15 years each for people to redevelop a fondness for 40s, 50s, and 60s American cars so there must be some good reason why this hasn't happened yet with the Malaise Era. It will be a buyers market for these cars in about 10 years and most people will look at them at car shows the way they look at old beer cans in an antique store.

Which one is more likely and why? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I write this because as much as people say Malaise Era cars were terrible, I think there were some high points. There were far fewer high points for the low powered, outdated, drab, "Commie Cars" of questionable quality. I think that if I had been a recent Eastern European immigrant in America when Malaise cars were still current, a midrange 1974-84 domestic such as a Chevy Caprice would feel like a king's car in comparison to Trabants and Ladas. On the other hand, old Eastern Bloc cars today seem to enjoy a larger cult following and higher continued use as daily drivers in their home markets compared to Malaise cars in North America. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> To think that a car built on an assembly line in Detroit, from a midrange brand, with fit and finish issues when new, and that was a common sight in trailer parks 30 years ago is selling for ultra-luxury exotic money seems ridiculous to me. I could understand $100k, or even, $150k being paid by some old rich dude who really wants it, but $350,000, really? </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I found this site with a large number of black   white pictures of old American cars in the USSR. Some appear to belong to diplomats or foreign governments, but others I'm not so sure. There seems to be one or more of almost everything from 1950-1979, including Cadillacs, Lincolns, Chevys, Mustangs, Challengers, and even AMCs. I had thought the import of US made cars and other products to the Soviet Union during the Cold War era was banned, and if not, extremely restricted.

	<TEXT> I regularly read that site, but outside of CC, and also sometimes The Truth About Cars, these types of cars are either ridiculed or ignored as I previously stated. I wait a long time for when Bring a Trailer decides to post a Brougham, which is rarely, and when it does happen, the comment section is overrun by trolls. They would rather see Ladas and black bumpered MGs with Lucas electronics for some reason. When I go between CC and BaT, I am amazed by how much difference there is between the tastes and opinions of the readers. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Am I weird for actually liking the Malaise Era? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-12-22 05:00:15 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Among other things, I really like Malaise Era American cars, and no not Trans Ams, DeLoreans, and Fox Mustangs, my thing is mainly the Great Brougham Epoch models. Lincoln Continentals, Cadillac Eldorados, big Buicks, Bonnevilles, Caprices, and Chrysler New Yorkers for example. While most on r/cars say that this was a dead zone for American cars, I think of the mid 70s-mid-80s and see a lot of domestics I would gladly own. Style wise, I find the oversized models just as attractive, elegant and intriguing as the earlier 50s and 60's versions. Many of the boxier, downsized versions I believe can be considered among the cleanest, best proportioned cars ever made, right there with the W123 and E30. They may not have been the pinnacle of reliability, efficiency, or engineering, but they have their positives. When I see them on the road today, they stand out from modern traffic with their boxy, sharp edged, un-sporty, un-aerodynamic lines, size, and presence. When I read r/cars or other car sites and see little positive being said when this era of American cars are brought up, I feel like I have the automotive equivalent of a strange fetish. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Why is it so uncommon to see late model cars made into lowriders? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-12-21 22:15:20 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> It seems like it in rare to see a late model (96' and up) car that has been made into a true lowrider. Not a stanced car, or bagged one, but one that has been modified with hydraulics and the other common customizations such as pinstriping. Is this because the mostly 50s-80's classics and older models that are popular are particularly suited for these sort of modifications? Are newer cars too hard to modify and work on, or do they just not have the right "style". </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I once saw a 400 mile 2009 MY car at a dealer. The story I was told is that  it was leased by a guy whose health failed shortly after obtaining it. He spent over a year in the hospital, during this time the car stayed parked and he was not allowed to cancel the lease. I'm guessing that his ability to drive was limited afterwards. This is the lowest mileage I've ever seen on a 4 year old car, so what your looking for is probably few and far between. </TEXT>
