	<TEXT> I thought Grant was finally validated in his life long belief that his brother ruined his life by claiming that Grant did that to their other brother, which then led to a series of other misfortune events that landed him in juvie and eventually with Hydra in the first place. I think he genuinely still cares for his SHIELD mates, at least Skye for any matter, and secretly hates the Hydra part of himself. But it's so engrained into his identity and who he is, that he can't detach himself from it. So that was the ultimate moment for Ward - to finally get his brother to acknowledge that he was ultimately the "cause" for all of Ward's problems/current state in his life.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey! Thanks for doing this! I have a few very basic questions. I'm trying to learn how to use Unity and some general programming overall. I've taken a very basic Java   C++ class before and I used to do some stuff in Ruby for RPG maker, so I have some rudimentary programming skills, but have a lot to learn. 

I'm trying to make a simple text /interactive fiction game which ideally I would want to look something like Twine (http://twinery.org/), but wrapped in some sort of GUI with point/click ability and background graphics. 

Just want some pointers on where to start/begin researching with something like this? I'd like to start with creating something like this maybe (except without the need for the room based map): 
http://forum.unity3d.com/threads/tidy-text-adventures-editor-tool-for-creating-text-based-adventure-games.164625/ 

I've never done anything like this and would just like a few pointers on where to begin. I'm not asking for an in depth tutorial or anything like that, just something like "you should read about x   y (ie parsing, etc) and how it ties into z (creating GUI, etc)". 

Thanks!   </TEXT>

When I was slightly overweight (on Asian standards mind you which meant I was like +5-10 lbs from my "ideal" weight = "holy shit you're so fat how are you ever going to get married" all the time. 

Then I went backpacking in Europe for a month and lost about 5-10 lbs = next time my parents saw me "holy shit we think you have a wasting disease you should go to the hospital to get that checked out". 

You literally cannot win.

	<TEXT> I'm really excited to see Simmons infiltrating the inner sanctum of Hydra in the coming weeks. Looking forward to her possible interactions with Agent 33 as well. I'm sure she's going to work on a way to combat the brainwashing/compliance for both Agent 33 and herself. I'm sure her cover is going to get blown eventually and they're going to try and brainwash her except at that point she'll already have developed a way to fight it. 

That or we're going to get a couple of episodes of some really awesome EvilMadScientist!Simmons.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That confrontation between Fitz and Ward was so powerful and absolutely heartbreaking. It's tragic to think of the consequences that Ward's betrayal has had on the team. Gone is the gentle and innocent boy scientist - replaced instead by this broken bitter man. Iain De Caestecker absolutely killed it in that scene - just the right amount of hyperventilation, fear, and barely restrained anger. 

Also, Ward is a manipulative shitbag. "It's good to see you Fitz?" Evil!Ward forever.  </TEXT>
