	<TEXT> Papers submitted to the *Journal of the BVA* might be peer-reviewed but that does not necessarily mean that they're all research papers. In the case of this submission, it's pretty clear that it's a review paper and not a research paper, in particular since it appears in the Vet Record Careers section of the journal and not in the Research section. </TEXT>

Here is the relevant section from the [Rules for Submissions](http://www.reddit.com/r/science/wiki/rules#wiki_submission_rules) (emphasis for clarity):

 Not a repost. If an alternate report based on the same research has been submitted, please submit your article as a comment to one of the current submissions. **Reposts are determined by reference to the original research being discussed, not the article discussing the research.** Your submission may be the only submission of that particular story, but it could be the 3rd submission of the original research. </TEXT>
