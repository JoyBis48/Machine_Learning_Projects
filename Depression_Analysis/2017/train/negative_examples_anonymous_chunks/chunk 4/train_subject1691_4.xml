	<TEXT> I'm a guy, I've been dealing with feeling down for years. I've never been diagnosed for depression and it doesn't really affect my everyday life, but I've never been happy either and there are times that I genuinely feel depressed, and I don't tell anyone, not even my parents or closest my friends. It's a secret that I keep to myself. I have to be a great son and friend, to perform as a student and athlete, I'm also a teacher and counselor and I hear many horrible stories from people in need of psychological support everyday. I'm not the one who's expected to snap. I just can't be. There's just too much pressure. Too much pressure to perform, to excel, to constantly be the best person that I can be. But one day I think I will snap, I just don't know when or how. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In layman's terms, the glycemic index indicates how quickly the nutrients are absorbed into the bloodstream and then either transformed to make energy or stored as fat tissue. The glycemic load, on the other hand, is more accurate as it takes into account how quickly it is absorbed, but also, how much sugar is actually absorbed. If you just look at the glycemic index, carrots appear to be really bad because they are digested really quickly. However, in reality carrots are still healthy, because they contain very little sugar, which the glycemic load reflects. 

What do glycemic index and glycemic load mean? Well, when you eat sugar, your pancreas secretes insulin which will help 'push the sugar' into your system so that, like I said, it can either used as energy or stored. More specifically, when insulin is secreted, glucose is stored as glycogen in your liver and muscle cells through a process known as glycogenesis, and when your blood sugar drops,  the glycogen is converted back to glucose through glycogenolysis, and then to a compound known as pyruvate through a process known as glycolysis, and from there, it will undergo many other changes in order to be used as energy. 

But the issue with the nutrients being pushed is that more of them will be wasted (as the body can only use so much nutrients at a given time) and turned into fat tissue. So insulin has its ups and downs, but definitely more downs if you're trying to cut and vice versa.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There is also research which suggests that eating healthy literally gets easier over time. This is because the nutrients you eat affect your gut flora composition, and in turn the bacteria in your gut influence your brain to make you crave the nutrients that they prefer through the gut-brain pathway. As you eat healthy more consistently, the 'bad food' micro organisms will get more and more replaced by the 'good food' ones, and you will start craving unhealthy foods less and less. So don't give up! It will definitely get easier.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> To me, there has always been a difference between spirituality and religion
. Spirituality makes sense from an evolutionary perspective, as it's the result of the interaction between our ability to think abstractly, and our ability to come up with answers to the questions that we raise, both for obvious survival purposes.

Religion, on the other hand, is the organization of sets of spiritual beliefs for social, political and economical reasons. 

I understand both spirituality and religion, and hate the latter, and also hate the fact that most people are not aware of that distinction.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> MGF is an isoform of Insulin-like growth factor 1. It is modified at the genetic level to produce a different mRNA sequence due to the addition of several nucleotide sequences. In rodents, it affects the post-exercise acute skeletal muscle repairing process, by activating the satellite cells in muscle tissue, which then proliferate and provide local muscle tissue with additional blast cells during myogenesis for muscle tissue repair. However, testing in humans is limited, so I would advise against taking what is said here too seriously.  </TEXT>

Also, to answer your question, it could be used in the near future (a couple years from now). However, here's the trick: the TGF- superfamily affects all tissues, not just the muscular ones. So, here, they had to create an isoform, a very similar version of Follistatin (FS315 in the article) that has been modified at the genetic level so as to produce a different mRNA sequence that specifically targets the myostatin pathway. Furthermore, there is no guarantee that inhibiting myostatin to the large extent that would most likely be required in order to produce a desired outcome in an athlete or bodybuilder would work or be side effect-free, as this is the first time this has been done in humans.

So the answer is yes, it could potentially be used already, but only if you are vastly rich, can find the qualified researchers to carry out such a costly and advanced procedure, and wish to turn yourself into a human guinea pig. But the potential of abuse by athletes in the near future is in fact so real that the WADA has already added 'gene doping' to its list of banned substances and processes.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Basically, I work as an English teacher at the Elementary level, but I also have a major in Biochemistry and a minor in Human Nutrition, and I try to do activities that will also indirectly teach my students the basics of nutrition, that is, the main food groups, the macro and micro nutrients, and healthy eating patterns in general. For me, it makes sense, as developing healthy life habits must start at a young age, and the kids also seem to enjoy learning about these things, which is a big plus.  But now I'm getting angry email and phone calls from some parents... According to them, I'm 'brainwashing their kids about food', which is causing them to complain that what their parents are putting on their plate is not healthy. These parents are obviously very ignorant about nutrition themselves, and live a sedentary lifestyle and look unhealthy/overweight, but I can't exactly tell them that without getting in trouble with my boss. I'm not sure what to do or how to respond to the angry complaints. Any ideas/advice?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No, but alcohol is harmful for a handful for a reasons, both for general health and bodybuilding. 

Firstly, alcohol cannot be processed directly by the body, it has to be broken down into a compound called acetaldehyde, which is classified as a carcinogen, meaning that it can damage DNA sequences and cause cancer. And a few people actually get cancer from alcohol consumption every year, mostly middle aged women.

Secondly, it disrupts the tricarboxylid acid cycle, because alcohol dehydrogenase, one of the dehydrogenase enzymes that break down nutrients in said cycle, are also involved in breaking down alcohol into acetaldehyde. Because of this, less nutrients can be turned into energy while your body is breaking down alcohol. And what happens  to nutrients that can't be turned into energy? They get sent back into the bloodstream as lipoproteins, and then stored as fat cells in your tissue. And on top of that, it also lowers blood sugar level significantly, making you hungry even though you don't actually need nutrients, since alcohol isn't broken down into anything remotely useful for your body; this is why nights of binge drinking are usually concluded at Mcdonalds or Burger King. 

Thirdly, it depletes the reserves of micro nutrients (minerals   vitamins) in your body at much faster rate than normally, for various reasons. Many of these micro nutrients are involved in various processes that relate to maintaining tissue maintenance and growth. 

And fourthly - and in my opinion this is the main reason why it's horrible for bodybuilders or athletes it general - it disrupts the synthesis of both testosterone and growth hormone, two hormones that are, needless to say, crucial for maintaining a lean, muscular and strong body.

And the list is actually bigger and more complex than that. This is just a few of the main reasons that I recall being mentioned in my Pharmacology and Metabolic Biochemistry classes.

Veggies: Avocados, beans (green, red, black, white, Lima, winged), lentils, sun-dried tomatoes, succotash (Lima   shell beans), soybean sprouts, spinach. 

Seeds: pumpkin seeds, quinoa seeds, hemp seeds

Sources of meat: salmon (high in good fats, including omega-3), tuna, tilapia, scallops, shrimps, lean ground beef, lean ground chicken

Others: natural peanut butter, cottage cheese, Greek yogurt, tofu.

It certainly won't work without on point dieting, and I wouldn't use if you are sensitive to stimulants (like caffeine) and/or have a history of heart issues in your family. Sympathomimetic drugs can be dangerous if you don't know what you're doing, and the fact that you're asking if it's a steroid tells me that you indeed don't, so I would say don't use it. :/ </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have a few biochem classmates who are big into using this. They say this: 

-It's an amphetamine-like stimulant, similar in structure to MDMA, norephedrine, ephedrine, etc (basically a phenetylamine with a Me group, for the chem folks)

-No fat burning properties

-Less addictive than well known related psychoactive compounds (such as MDMA)

-Very powerful stimulant 

-Some side effects that are dose dependent and vary from one person to another, such as loss of appetite, dilated pupils, increased sweating, increased heart rate

Obviously this is only anecdotal evidence, but I can't find any serious research from a reputable scientific journal either. Nothing on examine.com either. Does anyone have some info/insight into this stimulant drug?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A lot of people believe that the 'safe' age to start using steroids is 25, because many endocrinologists believe that the brain does not fully mature until that age.

A lot of people also say that there are two ways of using steroids: you can either use them to reach your limit genetic potential more quickly, in which case you can maintain your physique without sustained use afterwards, assuming that you keep training and eating properly, OR you can use them to go beyond your genetic limit in terms of muscular tissue, in which case you have to pretty much sustain use in order to stay there.

Now I don't know to what extent this is true or whether it's that arbitrary, because my understanding of the relationship between muscle mass, genes and hormones is fairly limited. However, it makes me worry because right now, I'm 21 and by the time I am 25, I will have been training for literally a decade (I have been lifting since I was 15 and dieting seriously since I was 17). I am pretty confident that if I continue to train and diet properly and keep improving my training and dieting method and knowledge, I will be at least pretty close to my genetic limit (if there's even such a thing) by the time I'm 25. My question is basically: assuming that I do reach my genetic potential in 5 years, if I wanna start using steroids by then, will I have to pretty much use them in a sustained manner in order to keep my gains? 

I'm sorry if this post is confusing, I'm hoping that it makes sense.  </TEXT>

I can tell that I would lose body fat for sure if I used this compound, because I understand the very basic related biochemical principles. If you have read what I wrote and understand it and still don't believe me, I'm not sure what to say. You could also look it up on the internet, the information is out there and it's well known that DNP is an extremely potent as a weight loss aid. It's simply not used because the mechanism involved can also cause a bunch of potentially dangerous side effects.  </TEXT>

[DNP in Bloodstream for 30 days using 36 hour half life](http://i.imgur.com/ReGBdSv.jpg)

[General guide on 2,4-Dinitrophenol 'Hungry on 2,4 Dinitrophenol'](http://pastebin.com/1G2k4Njs)

I can tell you for a fact that DNP works, not because I've tried it myself (in fact, I haven't), but because I've studied the biochemical principles that make it work. Strictly speaking, 2,4-Dinitrophenol is  a proton ionophore, meaning it basically moves freely across the cell membrane, and causes the proton gradient to be released as heat rather than being used in the ATP-making process of the mitochondrion. Normally, ADP is converted into ATP and then back into ADP, but DNP inhibits this process, meaning your body has to use all the stored nutrients just to keep you alive. It has an incredibly significant impact on weight even by research standards. In fact, its mechanism is being actively studied at the moment.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Carb cycling works, but not the way most people think. It works because of the relationship between polysaccharides and leptin, a complex adipose tissue hormone of which the main purpose is to mediate the effects of neurotransmitters known as endocannabinoids in the brain. These neurotransmitters increase appetite and slow down metabolism. In experiments done on rodents, they found that leptin production tends to increase and decrease along with polysaccharide intake in the long run, but not with shorter chains of monosaccharide units, lipids or amino acids. Because of this, carb cycling should consist of high starch, moderate protein, low fat   low sugar 'refeed' days. There's no consensus on how much you should eat during those days as far as I know, but there's some anecdotal evidence that you should eat at caloric maintenance.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Serious question. Do you guys think that in the future we will be able to alter the genes responsible for the production of the Growth Differentiation Factor (GDF) proteins for athletic purposes? 

Inhibition of GDF-8 is already known to result in an increase in muscular tissue and a reduction in adipose tissue in a controlled setting, at least in mice and primates. And there are a couple cases of kids being born with a mutated GDF-8 gene and having incredible muscular mass and strength as a result. Seems to me that the idea won't be too far-stretched anymore in a couple years from now.  </TEXT>

Wouldn't that be awesome?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, you're probably right. I'm studying in Education, so I've had many Psychology classes and have done a lot of research on Human Behavior, and based on both that and my general culture, I think it's no coincidence... In the gym, I've always wanted to be the biggest and leanest, and when playing online games, I've always wanted to be the best, the most skilled, the most advanced. For me both have always felt like addiction, or like obsessions. And I don't know if it's gonna change. But is it really an issue? As long as you're happy with something, I don't think it ever is.  </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2015-03-26 15:57:15 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Most of my friends who are big into bodybuilding are somewhat stereotypical 'fitness girls', and the only video games that they know are the Wii fit game and Call of Duty, and they don't even play them... They don't even know of computer games like League of Legends and WoW. 

On the other hand, my gamer friends are somewhat unhealthy, eat whatever whenever and don't exercise. 

I find it difficult to feel like I belong to either group of people, because I enjoy both - I aspire to become a bodybuilder, lift 5 days a week and count all my calories, but I also consider myself a hardcore gamer - I've been playing online games competitively since I was a kid and sometimes I play 6-7 hours a day or more. When I'm not lifting or making food, I'm pretty much always gaming. 

Is it like that for everyone or am I just unlucky in my life?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Alcohol cannot be digested directly by the body, so instead it is broken down into acetaldehyde, which can damage DNA and therefore cause cancer - this is what carcinogens do, and a few people per year actually get cancer due to alcohol consumption. 

Alcohol also does a handful of other harmful things to the body. First, it disrupts the body's main metabolic pathway, the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Normally, proteins, carbohydrates and fats are transformed into energy with the help of co-enzymes. However, one  co-enzyme in particular, known as alcohol dehydrogenase, is also responsible for breaking down alcohol into acetaldehyde. Because alcohol is prioritized by the body (as it is seen as harmful), this co-enzyme cannot do its usual job of breaking down nutrients for energy, therefore slowing down metabolism. This actually increases stored fat, since the nutrients that cannot be used for metabolism are sent into the bloodstream and then stored as fat cells in the body. 

What is even worse is that, since alcohol is broken down, your blood sugar level is lowered and you become hungry, despite not being in any need of nutrients since none have been used. This is why nights out drinking usually end up at Mcdonalds, and just create an even greater increase in stored fat.

Alcohol also depletes the body's reserves of vitamins and minerals and reduces the production of various hormones in the body that are associated with well-being, such as testosterone and growth hormone. It is incredibly harmful to the body.  </TEXT>
