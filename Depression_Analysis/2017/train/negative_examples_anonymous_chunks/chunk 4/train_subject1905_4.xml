	<TEXT> Not everyone has a nice car and not everyone who has a nice car actually lives here. San Diego is a big place so it looks like everyone has a nice car. And don't forget that you can lease a Beemer pretty cheaply. 

Roommates definitely help and I know a lot of people who have them. You can find places pretty reasonably but you have to look around. You can find stuff on the beach for your $1k or less but you'll have to drive around looking for signs and check out craigslist. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I totally agree with you. I found it intolerable with the over the top message and terrible acting. I cannot believe that it got as high of a score that it did. 

It took itself way too seriously for me to consider it a "fun" movie. </TEXT>
