	<TEXT> I've always looked at fashion boards as an extended group of friends.  If you are around a certain group long enough you begin to act, dress, and like the things the group as a whole likes.  Every board had their select few individualists, sometimes they are the creative's, or industry people, or even just the ones with the most money and they tend to spark trends in the community.the only way to get "beyond"the group is to leave that specific group.
I'm a hypebeast person from 06, when I joined wdywt consisted of evisu, and red monkey jeans, bape hoodies, and dunks.  User/blogger Neek was the first to start posting fits of 501stf,wtaps/cukkas, and solid colored tshirts.  at first it wasn't well regarded "too sufu" a month later and it was the biggest entire forum paradigm shift I ever remember seeing.

	<TITLE> Can I transfer credit history, from an old to a new card? Same bank. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-05-13 08:13:25 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Sorry if this is a dumb question, anyhow.
My first credit card was a CapitalOne Platinum card, It was just about the only card I could get with very little credit history.  After a year or so my credit score is ~700, and I was pre-approved for the Cap quicksilver card.
If I have 2 cards in my wallet, one with a higher APR and no rewards and the other the opposite I don't see myself using the platinum card any more.  I don't want to close my platinum card, and lose all the history I built with it.  I also don't want to keep it unused and have that go against my credit score, as little as it may actually effect it.

I'm also planning on applying for the Discover it card, and don't really care to keep track of 3 credit cards.  I'm very responsible with credit, and 90% of the time I don't carry a balance from month to month unless I'm hit with a last minute emergency in which I clear it off as quickly as possible.  I'm just not the most organized person in the world, so the thought of carrying around 3 cards scares me.

Thanks in advance. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> ARM, vs Fixed rate? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-04-20 07:39:01 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I am planning on buying a condo in the next month, I will be taking a 30-year mortgage and am not sure whether to go with an adjustable or fixed rate.
I'm accounting for my finances with no over-time at work, and I will be fine making payments with either loan.  I'm planning on paying the loan back within 10 years.  For the moment going with an ARM would save me on monthly payments for when I am not getting over-time.  (its slow season now)  For 2/3rds of the year I am planning on making double/triple payments.
Would I be wise to stick with the best % fixed rate mortgage?

I have about enough finances saved up to pay it off in full if things get bad, but I would rather build more credit.  I also don't want to buy a cheap condo in full and have no just-in-case money left.

PS. thanks to everyone who helped me out in my rent vs buy topic from a couple days ago.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Absolutely atleast 5 years.
The place I have my eye on currently, well one of many.  The one I'm waiting to hear back from has been on the market for about half a year, and has already lowered their price about 10k.  It isn't a very convenient area, it just happens to be very very convenient to the place I work.  I do need to have it seriously checked out though, if I get serious on this one.  Because that length of time tends to make me nervous.
Thanks for the advice! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Me and my girlfriend are pretty serious, but at the moment I need to do whats best for me.  Since moving back home I have an hour commute to her, and a 45 minute commute to work.  The places I am looking to live would be within 25 minutes from her, and 10-odd minutes to work. ~200 a month in gas in my civic is getting old.
She doesn't have a car, She moved to the states when she was 16 and has had Boston public transportation ever since.  Wherever I look at I anticipate bringing her, and value her opinion.  But for the moment I want to prove that I can be completely independent by myself, and hopefully she will move in with me eventually.  I can't afford to live walking distance from the subway by myself, and need to be safe if anything happens between us.
Just to clarify, she makes more money than me.  She doesn't drive because she never needed to drive, but she's working on it. (I don't want anyone thinking poorly of my lady ;))

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm 28 years old and was renting for a few years.  My father passed away last year and I moved back in with my mother. (not trolling for sympathy, just giving context).
My childhood house is going on the market, and I need to come up with something to do soon/within the next few months.  Condo's in my area are in the 75-100k range, and I have enough money saved where I could comfortably put in a 30% dp.  If anything goes completely awry I have enough saved where I could probably buy it outright.  
I make about 40k, and am happy at my job and don't intend on leaving it or my area any time soon.  It also works out with the loan I'd be taking plus average hoa fees in my area that I could live in a nicer condo for cheaper than renting.

I strongly oppose going back to having roomates, and I don't want a house (after maintaining my current home over the past year).

edit: also I know this isn't the reality sub, but if anyhow knows about how firm condo prices are it would be appreciated.  I don't want to offer 65k on an 80k condo, planning to settle between 70-75 and have my offer seem like a slap in the face only to not hear back.  (I don't know if condo's are like houses, and owners expect an offer, or if they expect to get the asking price.)

Any opinions or advice would be greatly appreciated, hopefully y'all can help me from giving myself more headaches. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> raw denims been becoming mainstream for a long time.  Similar to how street wear used to be exclusive to small boutiques, and now its available at zumies.


5 years ago you saw Raw denim at high-end stores/some boutiques, now you can get it at urban outfitters and macy's.

Not that there's anything wrong with that.

The niche market likes it, the famous people start wearing it, the rest of the world wants it. It is what it is </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Comcast, issue in adding digital voice and internet blast service. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-02-05 23:48:53 </DATE>

	<TEXT> Just last week I upgraded my service to a triple play deal, because it worked out to be cheaper than my current tv and internet separate bill.  along with upgrading my internet from performance (25MBps) to 50*.
Today I go outside and find a box from comcast, inside was a technicolor TC8305C MONSTROSITY.  I called comcast to say I did not want it, only to find out I had a tech coming to my house in 2 days, I had no idea about this.
Currently I have a asus RT-AC68R, and a Motorola SB6121.  Am I going to need this outrageous technicolor box to add digital voice to my package?  Or is there an inline solution they can do.  I dont want another 2.4GHz device mucking up my signal (I have a pretty large house, and have a few devices stuck on 2.4 still)
Is my best bet to pay comcast for a phone line that I don't use, and continue paying AT T for my phone service? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> True, the other day I got my jcrew selvedge chambray stuck between some pressing rollers at work.rather than being smart and turning off my machine I instinctively ripped my shirt out. I lost a button, and was amazed it didn't get torn at the stitching.if their quality starts to diminish I'll just have to go elsewhere. </TEXT>

I have a 197X austro daimler AD S, which im trying to convert as cheaply as possible, hence why i'm looking at retrospec.
Just getting back into cycling, and don't want to drop a lot in case its just a passing phase.
Also if anyone has recommendations on quality budget cranksets/wheels I would love to hear. (as quality as budget can be) </TEXT>
