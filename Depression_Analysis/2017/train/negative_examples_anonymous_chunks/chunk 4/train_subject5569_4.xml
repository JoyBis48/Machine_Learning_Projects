	<TEXT> My parents attempted to raise me Lutheran.  But, they also raised me to be intelligent and to think for myself.  And what I have come to think for myself is that all religion is bullshit, useful for controlling the masses and that's about it.  I have no use for it.  This, I'm an atheist.  But, I don't go around with an "Ask me about my Atheism" button on. </TEXT>

My point was that the phone sitting with the screen turned on and otherwise not doing anything doesn't represent a useful scenario.  If someone was reading or watching a show there'd be processor activity, touchscreen activity, etc.  In this case there was none of that, which is why it is meaningless. </TEXT>
