	<TEXT> That's the interesting point.

If you didn't have a dick, you're okay, because you are a beautiful woman.

If you had a black dick, you would be okay because you were an oppressed black person.

If you didn't acknowledge or like the fact that you have a dick, then you're okay because you are a special transgender who just wants to be free.

But if you have and enjoy your white dick, then fuck you. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't quite understand the issue with /r/Art 

What makes art... art?

Is it the subject material? Does a drawing have to have a deeper meaning before it becomes art?

Is it originality? Does it need to be completely original and have no  prior inspiration?

Is it the medium? Does canvas and paint have more right to be called "art" than crayon and construction paper?

Because [Jackson Pollock](http://www.internetmonk.com/wp-content/uploads/pollock.number-8.jpg), [Andy Worhol](http://www.warhol.org/exhibitions/2012/15minuteseternal/en/img/art-marilyn-470x469.jpg), and [Pablo Picasso](http://metacool.typepad.com/metacool/images/11048740ll.jpg) would beg to differ. </TEXT>

Question 1 - How "new" is your friend?

Is this someone you've known for a few months from work, but don't have any newer friends than them?

Or is it someone that you met within the past few weeks?

Question 2 - How are they selling the car?

If they are selling to a guy on Craigslist, do they have a way of trusting the transaction?

Question 3 - Why can they not cash or deposit the check themselves?

Even if they don't have a bank account, most banks will allow an account to be opened with an initial check deposit. There is little reason to take a check for someone else.

If you can not answer those questions satisfactorily, or if the answers make you uncomfortable, *do not perform the transaction*. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, yes. I take issue with it. That is part of having an opinion.

If it is insane to have an opinion, even a *wrong* opinion (which is your opinion), then lock me up in a padded cell.

**WARNING - My Opinion**

Tidal *can* offer whatever terms it wants, but ultimately they are the weaker service when it comes to the one metric that matters... The number of subscribers.

If Tidal were to be *smart* about it, they would say that musicians should have *some* exclusivity with Tidal, instead of trying to strongarm them into full exclusivity. And strongarm it is, since they try to make all the **small** artists exclusive, but the **big names** can choose to go to other services.

For example... [Kanye West](https://play.spotify.com/user/xpoplicola/playlist/77fa6y3frmLh2Jn2J3d6Xn), [Jay-Z](https://play.spotify.com/artist/3nFkdlSjzX9mRTtwJOzDYB), [Daft Punk](https://play.spotify.com/artist/4tZwfgrHOc3mvqYlEYSvVi)... All still on Spotify, but if I make a song, and I want it on Tidal, I have to sign an exclusivity contract.

Is that fair? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The big thing that I can think of to do is to reevaluate the construction when you come up against a plot point you didn't plan for.

For example, you make a grand battle between good and evil where the protagonist takes on the Big Bad singlehandedly. But while writing, you realize that the plucky best friend is just the type of person to stand with the hero.

You write the section with that change, and then rework the plan to include it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Okay... so you are saying that Inception stole dream-within-a-dream and dream-diving from Final Fantasy 8?

I'm sorry, but this is less a theory and more a fanfiction.

First, there is no discrepancy solely contained in Disc 1, unless you accept this to be true from the start. And the only weirdness is the shared vision on the train.

Quistis hit on Squall early on because they are roughly the same age, and he is single and attractive.

Everything else here can't be disproven, the same way you can't disprove that I saw a dragon last night.

Ultimately, this is just an attempt at shoehorning an unrelated movie into a game.  </TEXT>

By thrashing about, you unsteady the body, but you also lower the amount of water directly beneath you.

This causes less upward pressure on your body from the higher-density water and causes/allows you to sink. Adding in the effect of your thrashing causing water to move around you, and your head easily goes underwater. </TEXT>

It was one of the Sword of Truth novels, Temple of the Winds.

Kahlan and Richard are taken into separate tents and told they have to consummate their marriages to other people (even though they love each other only. It's a magic thing.).

However, Richard was swapped with the other guy, because of shenanigans and since they weren't allowed to say anything Kahlan didn't know.

They bone, which to her felt like she was being violated, no matter how well Richard treated her, then she realized that for the magic to work she had to enjoy herself.

So she goes a second time, being more forceful, with Richard knowing that she thinks he is the other guy. She cums like their is no tomorrow, and then "surprise! You just raped your husband!" </TEXT>

It's about punishment. The idea that we would agree to take rapists, mass murderers, baby killers, and (ultimately because we need it for the story) over muscled political dissodents, and have them be publically hunted for sport is... a little far fetched.

Especially when today we live in a society that give Charles Manson a token parole hearing. It would take a *lot* of changes, not limited to the complete repealing of the Constitution.  </TEXT>

Look at all the boy heroes out there. They mostly turn out "okay" (Tim Drake), but they are damaged goods, the lot of them.

Their friends are mostly people they fight alongside, their family are targets. Most of them end up hiding their identities to protect the ones they love. If they are lucky, their human friends don't turn into supervillains.

I'm not saying "superhero is the worst thing ever", but if you are saddled with that burden and given superspeed, superstrength, or magic powers, you are following a hard path...

And if you are a good person, you are not going to ignore it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ironically, that plan simply increases the use of student debt.

If they were to do this regularly, the students have an encouragement to default, the schools would raise tuition rates to raise the value of the unpaid debts and get as much as they can out of the paid ones, and the losers would be the people who donated money.

It wouldn't end tuition-related financial trouble at all. </TEXT>

It costs enough of you a little bit of reading time, it can get them a decent payday.

	<TEXT> I wouldn't flag this as part of that fallacy.

The squirrel did not have any ill intent when it got itself electrocuted, it was neutral. Such an accident would be seen by everyone around as a freak occurrence. The power company and electricians would see it as the cost of doing business, and the customers would see it as an inconvenience.

In the long run, the customers only lose out if they decided to go to a hotel while the power is fixed (a completely optional choice), and the electric company would take repair costs out of preassigned funds, with likely no effect on the bottom line.

In this particular case, the destruction has a benefit of keeping electricians in work and in practice, at the cost of customers being a little hot. </TEXT>
