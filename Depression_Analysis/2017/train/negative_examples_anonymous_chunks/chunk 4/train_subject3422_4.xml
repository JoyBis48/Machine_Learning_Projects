	<TEXT> Yeah. I just found a method to run from RocketDock/Desktop

#YOU NEED TO SAVE BOTH LAYOUTS FIRST


TO MAKE THE JOB EASIER FOR YOU UNHIDE APPDATA. if you don't know how to do so look it up. 


Create two .bat files using Notepad 

Type:

**Taskkill /im Rainmeter.exe**
(***repeat for the amount of skins you have loaded + the one above is the process itself***)


(Enter)


**start "" "C:\Program Files\Rainmeter\Rainmeter.exe" "C:\Users\[*USER NAME*]\AppData\[*SKIN LAYOUT NAME*]\Rainmeter.ini"**


**INCLUDING QUOTATION MARKS**


Save as .bat


Do again for both monitors

^NOTE^: don't forget to change the screen layout name to the one of the second monitor. After you copy and paste. 

PS: you can convert to .exe. With online program. When compiling to exe check invisible Program. Now cmd will not show while running script.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This happened to me too. I run a laptop with a second monitor. Everything on the second screen ends up disorganized on my monitor when disconnected. 

My last resort, after hours of trial and error, was to create two layouts. One for single monitor on the move and another for dual monitor. Tested and it works well. As for now this is the only solution. I am still looking for a method to load the layouts from the desktop/rocket dock  (too lazy to enter the program everyone at school.)

I'll keep you up to date.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> No Smooth Scroll and Touchpad Zoom </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-04-19 11:34:56 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Since I moved to a laptop a few months ago, I have stuck to using IE11. Don't judge me, but I have found it to be remarkably good, as it supports auto-correct, touchpad zoom and smooth scrolling which I absolutely love using. I use a mouse while producing music and therefore the smooth scroll comes in handy.

I do know that there are plugins for this on the chrome store, and at chrome://flags. But these controls are often wonky and I'd like them natively and stable in chrome. I do prefer IE over chrome at the moment as there are certain sites which format wrongly on IE. IE also does not completely support HTML5.

For now I'll stick to IE having chrome installed as alternative, for the sole reason that IE is easier to use for the laptop. I'd be happy to switch to chrome in an instance, if they integrate smooth scroll and tp zoom natively.

I do know that this is not the perfect place to portray my opinions, but frankly IDGAF. sorry guys </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So I've noticed that the ie plugin page only has a small amount of plugins listed there. Unlike the chrome store or the Mozilla store most plugins are on independent sites. Anyone who uses IE11 frequently post your favorite plugins and links.
