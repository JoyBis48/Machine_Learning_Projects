First off, these types of apps already exist, and aren't terribly successful. The adoption rate is quite low, and would be a waste of my time unless I really felt like sitting down and making a beautiful app - which I don't.

You think anyone in my area has spare parking spots? Anyone with a garage uses it. The problem is not communication. It's supply. There is a nursing home nearby I can park at, but it's not so close.

And I think you are mixing up things anyway. Shutting down the government due to a disagreement of budgeting - that's not pork. That's what a budget is. "Make these spending cuts, or we won't agree on a budget". Very related. 

If Republicans made a demand that is *not* related to the budget/spending, then that would be similar. Still, does not compare to relief funds or other kind of emergency funding. </TEXT>

There is a very big difference between adding pork barrel spending to a bill that is not an emergency, vs using this tactic when emergency relief funds are required.

If Republicans tacked on tax breaks to the relief fund bill, wouldn't Democrats vote against it? Wouldn't that be downright disgusting? But that's basically what happened here.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Someone making $75k straight out of college will be making $90k in a few years. And if they only had to take out $30k, their loans would all be quite low in percentage (probably no private loans needed). Of course it would be better to have less debt.

However my point is that the numbers are no even close to what I'm saying. Average student debt is greater than $30k, and the average salary is closer to $40k (many students don't even get jobs). That is the problem. If we were all only at a 40% debt ratio, we wouldn't have 35% of people between 22-30 living in their parents homes.

And your high school comparison is nice, but I'd take the $30k debt any day over no debt and a $9/hr job. That $9/hr job won't get you anywhere. So yea that's nice you can do it for cheaper, but it is not an end result. 

 To suggest that 40% of your income going toward student loans is fine is financially irresponsible.

Who said 40% of your income goes to the loan? You pay the loan over 10-25 years. Your payment will be less than 10% of your income. 

I can tell you because the numbers I used is exactly my position. I have $30k in loans, $75k income, and my loans payments are about 5% of my income. Over the life of my loan I'll pay around $6,000 interest. Considering the job that I have, and the career I have ahead of me, it was more than worth it. 

However to only have $30k in loans, I had to go to community college for two years, and have my parents assistance in paying some of my tuition. $30k is after all of that. The system is messed up. Period. The tuition is just too damn high. The loans are not the problem. They are a symptom of a much bigger and complicated issue. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  So, if I understand the habits of you people correctly

Excuse me?

It's interesting how the Post dissects one of the dozens of times Gruber said about masking the cost of Obamacare in order to get it passed. This article from the post would make sense - if that was the only quote we have a Gruber. And let us not forget our President himself who promised we could keep our doctors, which he knew to be a flat-out lie.

If this was a little bill, it probably wouldn't matter. But this was the biggest piece of legislature in the past 2-3 decades (maybe more), so you can't just throw your hands up in the air and say, "Oh haha that's how they do it in politics!".

 I'd like to see Republicans say that when defending Bush's invasion of Iraq, and see how liberals take it. "haha yea we lied about WMDs. You know, people are stupid. If we told them the truth, we would have never been able to invade Iraq! HAHAHA"

Yea, I'm sure you'd think that's totally legit.

And my initial comment was a joke. But it's also poking at liberals who are quoting an Republican Senator in a Liberal state who is now claiming the court cases are built on lies - that's a story here. But building the entire premise of Obamacare on lies? That's not a story. That's my point. They are connected in a way. And it's kind of worthless to be quoting a Republican is who likely just trying to appeal to her Democratic constituents in her state. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't think you understand supply and demand. If every single person has a diploma - then the value of the diploma (from the recruiter's perspective) is exactly zero. Everyone has one. If only 30% of people have one, then finding a candidate with a diploma is more difficult. The diploma now has value. The person with the diploma now has an easier time finding a job (compared to those without diplomas).

Growing up I used to always hear the stats on how someone with a diploma vs someone without, will end up making $1,000,000 more over 25 years (or something like that). Those stats are not valid anymore, as even those with diplomas cannot get jobs - or take jobs they probably could have gotten without a diploma.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>   I'd also say the job market is partially to blame for demanding college degrees for jobs that don't need it.

You have the cause and effect backwards. Since so many people have degrees (the supply is high), they can demand degrees. I mean, why would you take an employee without a degree when an employee with a degree is so damn easy to find?

 I don't think the government is subsidizing it though, they actually turn a profit on student loans last time I checked. Students are getting shackled with loans many of which are at 8% interest.

Two things wrong with these statements:

* 8% interest is private loans that has nothing to do with government loans
* Any profit the government makes is solely due to graduate degrees (doctors, lawyers, MBAs). If we look at undergraduate only, the government absolutely does not make a profit.

A good quote from a Forbes article [here](http://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffreydorfman/2014/04/19/student-loan-profits-show-government-should-get-out-of-student-loan-business/)

 Are student loans different in a sense that we should allow borrowers to place themselves under debt burdens they cannot carry? I dont think so. If some students cannot borrow money for college because they will likely be unable to repay their debts, the student is probably better off without the loan. If such a system means some students are encouraged to study a subject expected to produce earnings upon graduation rather than a subject which is not, society will not only survive but likely benefit. </TEXT>

Yea that's what we are talking about here when Bernie says he wants to make tuition free. So yes, post-education is what we are talking about.

 Education is first and foremost designed to teach you how to think

12 years of formal education can't do this? The idea that somehow we need to spend 4 years to 'learn how to think' is absolutely appalling. Not to mention the free resources available to students today can easily replace much (not all) of the material covered in college. The 4 year college experience should not be required to be considered an educated person. If that's your goal - do it in two years at the most. You simply don't need 4.

 The argument that there are too many diplomas obscures the issue that for many in the job market the diploma is a necessity--this is a problem with the job market and not with the number if diplomas.

The more diplomas, the less valuable each diploma is. Period. It's quite simple. 

Your comments about researchers is bothersome. So you think it is OK for us to be taking money from a 19 year old, with no job, with no income, and use their debt to increase the reputation/esteem/prestige of the college? Shouldn't that money only be going to enhance their education? Wtf is that about? Young students are paying for public universities to have high tech research - which in turn does nothing to help them have a better education.

Saying that the entire problem lies with the fact that taxpayers don't provide free tuition - it's not only short sighted- it's just plain stupid. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  how are the current government conservative policies not "short-sighted."

Didn't say the aren't short-sighted. It is possible to criticize a liberal idea, while at the same time not agreeing with some Republicans and their policies. 

I would do the following:

* Freeze all tuition for public schools
* Limit the amount of money public schools can spend on research
* Force schools to take a larger percentage of the burden buy forcing them to use more of their endowments to make tuition cheaper for students
* Encourage/discourage certain degrees by offering a set amount of grants/loans for certain majors. For example, provide full grants for 1,000,000 engineering majors a year, but only 50,000 to sociology majors. 
* Offer more incentives/funding to non-4 year institutions that provide training

Just some things to do. We need to completely turn around the entire 'college experience'. It's a drain on our economy, it's a drain on parents and on students. And for what? So that they 'can learn how to think'? What nonsense is that? We need to spend $100,000 to 'learn how to think'? And then 'learn how to live in your parents basement', and then 'learn how to collect unemployment'? We are doing a disservice to our children and setting them up to fail. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would eliminate the word 'reality' from your vocabulary, because you clearly don't understand what it is.

 "Greatly effect" is clearly a lie

In 2009, the number of Americans who had a pension or 401k was around 40%. Now considering anyone below the age of 18 would never have a pension/401k, that means the majority of the **middle class** has some form of pension or 401k.

  but those who do are harmed insignificantly by the change (save for the middlemen who rake in commissions by uselessly churning other people's money.)

You pulled that out of your ass. What reality do you live in? The funds that are behind pensions and 401ks will get hit by the cost, and will increase their commission rates, or simply lower their return. It's not just HFT that will get hurt - we all will.

Not to mention that even more liberal countries like England refuse to have such a law, as they know companies will just move to France or Germany. The net result would be less revenue - which defeats the entire purpose of the law. 

And for some simple math - if you have a $1 billion fund - lets say you make $300 million in trades a month - that is $3.6 billion in trades. .5% of $3.6 billion is $18 million. That's a 1.8% overall tax on the entire fun. That tax is now taken out of the return to the customer. What you are left is with a significant decrease to the rate of return for pensions and 401k. 

Bernie's proposal is not new or revolutionary. It's been discussed before [here is a short article](http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2013/05/08/the-financial-transactions-tax-will-just-kill-the-banking-economy/) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Root causes/problems: 

* rising tuition costs - not actually the cost of education, but the rising dollar amount that institutions charge to students. This is the biggest problem. We wouldn't care about student debt if tuition was $2,500 a year. 
* Increased number of diplomas given out, diminishes the value of the diplomas
* Poor economy and job placement after college.
* Too many students getting majors that cost too much, and have no hope of paying back the loans.
* Not enough students going to trade schools or other fields that do not require a 4 year degree.
* Governments continuing to allow public schools to raise tuition 
* Institutions using students' money, and taxpayer money to make lavish campuses - but not to better the actual education.
* Institutions using students' money, and taxpayer money to increase their reputation by hiring elite researchers (at no benefit to undergraduates)
* The *culture* pushed by k-12 that everyone should go to college- if they don't, they are somehow a failure.

The problem is the *cost*, and the *job placement* after college. I think we would all be OK with $30,000 of debt, if we all had jobs that paid $75,000 out of college.

The fact that students are struggling with debt is the symptom of a lot of other issues (that I mentioned). Bernie's solution does nothing but eliminate debt - which is nice - but doesn't fix the root problems - and in fact would likely exacerbate many of them. </TEXT>
