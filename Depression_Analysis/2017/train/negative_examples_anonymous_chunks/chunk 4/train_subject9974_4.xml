	<TEXT> Obviously this is a subjective question.

I don't believe the point of religion is "getting back to God" or "helping your fellow man", though those are two admirable things.

I believe the point of religion is to properly serve our Creator according to His holy Law. It is not about a unification of consciousness or altruism, it is about complete obedience to our Sovereign King.

	<TEXT> I meant to say state action in the marketplace. My mistake.

Because I believe I should be allowed to work for however much or little I want. If I choose to accept conditions below minimum wage, that is my business. I have in the past worked for low wages, and would again. I don't like the state telling me what I must work for. I also don't like the state pretending to be my nanny. I believe as an individual I have the right to agree to any contract I want. It is not the state's business what I choose to work for. 

If a union wants to argue with an employer about wages, that is their business. I don't care what they do. Everyone in that union has the right to free association, and if they can strike or whatever to get the employer to agfee to their contract that is all fine. I don't believe it is ever the state's job to intervene though. The state should enforce contracts, not make contract demands. It is the individual's (or group of individuals') responsibility and right to make any contract they are willing to agree to.

Since I believe life begins af conception, I believe abortion is an act of aggression against a human life, which I would never support under any circumstance. Violence should only be used in defense and never aggression.

I am a libertarian laissez faire capitalist. I believe the markets should be free from state control. I did not come here to egg on a political discussion though, that was not the intent of my OP. </TEXT>

My question was not about a personal curcumstance though.

In some states it is nearly impossible to work in the blue-collar career you are skilled in without joining a union.

I have nothing against the idea of unions, I think everyone should be allowed to associate with whomever he or she chooses. I just do not know of any unions that operate from my perspective, and I would not want to join an organization that runs counter to my ethos. </TEXT>

1. Because Jesus Christ is fully God, and we are forbidden from making images of God.

2. Because it is impossible for finite men to draw one Person with two natures ... the picture will be heretical.

3. Because Jesus Christ has ascended with a glorified body. We have no way of picturing the Risen Christ.

4. Any picture of Jesus we make will be a fashioning of his appearance by us, not as God revealed, for we don't know what Jesus looked like.

5. You need to contemplate God to draw Him, and we can't contemplate without owing worship. So, we either fail to revere God or we worship Him by image.

6. Because God is spirit, and this cannot be captured by a picture. </TEXT>

Read section XXI. That is where the RPW is explicitly stated thusly

T*he acceptable way of worshipping the true God is instituted by Himself, and so limited by His own revealed will, that He may not be worshipped according to the imaginations and devices of men, or the suggestions of Satan, under any visible representation, or any other way not prescribed in the holy Scripture.*

All of us believe exactly the same on everything in the confession. We do not believe in individual interpretation. 

Some confessional presbyterians deviate very slightly from exclusive psalmody and allow hymns as well. Nonetheless, even they would be *very* strict about what is allowed in worship.

We do not use instruments in worship. There is some debate about the use of instruments within the RP camp, but my particular group does not.

I would not say Pres. Obama is a socialist, he is a progressive democrat. 

We disagree on the role of the state. We believe the markets should be free, and nobody should be forced to pay for other's welfare. We believe welfare should be accomplished through voluntary association (i.e. charity, relgious organizations, and non-profits.) We believe the state should not force contracts on people. It is up to each individual to negotiate and decide what contract he is willing to work for (or join a union voluntarily to band together to bargain collectively).

	<TEXT> I believe in bettering the world we live in through voluntary action and free choice, not through the government trying to do it through force.

What kind of world would it be if the government told me what I was allowed to work for? Am I not an individual? Why should they force me to accept their conditions? I want nothing to do with them, yet they are going to force me to work for 7 paid sick days, thus removing yet one more thing that might distiguish me from other job applicants.

I say leave me the hell alone. What benefits I choose to work for is none of their damn business. If someone else wants 7 paid sick days, 15 dollars an hour, etc, they can go find that job. If I am willing to work for less, with no sick days, why shouldn't I be allowed to? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The point is we do not believe it is the state's job to demand what an employer and employee agree to in a contract. 

We like the government out of our business. I don't want them making my employer give me days ofd, I don't want them telling me what benefits I have to work for. It is my business and my business alone what contract I choose to accept.

Perhaps agreeing to work for less sick days makes me more marketable to employers? I am willing to work for zero paid sick days if it makes me more competetive in the job market. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you are celibate, then yes.

If you are engaging in sexual relations with the same sex... Maybe. Let me explain. 

Christians can sin. If you are a Christian, and are attracted to the same sex, and slip and have sexual relations, you do not lose your salvaion or anything. 

If you are living a life of outright noncelibate same sex relations, that is not an indicator of discipleship. True disciples do not live in blatant sin for extended periods of time.

I take the traditional and orthodox stance that same sex relations are a sexual sin, just like adultery, lust, sex outside of marriage etc. A Christian can slip and be involved in any of those sins. A Christian cannot live a life of blatant disobedience in any of those areas for an extended period of time. </TEXT>

In a few pentecostal type churches they have bishops in the traditional diocesian sense.

Oftentimes they see the word bishop as interchangable with elder or pastor. Many times they are ordained by their denomination.

Others are ordained by no one. Oftentimes these are the ones who open up their own "worldwide ministries" operating as entrepreneurs peddling Christendom to whoever they can. </TEXT>

We don't believe you can come to God any way exceot through the word revealed in Scriptures. The Scriptures are the only revealed word of God. The Scriptures are the complete word of God. There is no other revelation at all. Since we are staunch adherents to the RPW, we allow nothing j  worship that is not commanded in Scripture. No outside traditions. No images, no human written songs (I am Exclusive Psalmody), no church calender etc. 

That is what we mean by Sola Scriptura. It is not that the Scruptures are the highest revelation of God among many, we beleieve the Scriptures are the **only** revelation of God at all. (In an immanent sense). </TEXT>

Paul was very schooled in the Pagan Greek poets, and Greek philosophy and rhetoric. He was familiar with the Olympic sports (hardly a Christian institution). There is value to culture and cultural identity. We do not allow that cultural heritage to influence our worship. 

See Paul's argument for food offered to idols in 1 Cor 8. I would place cultural celebrations in this category.  </TEXT>

We acknowledge the paganistic core of these holidays, and therefore do not acknowledge them as Christian. If you go to our churches on Easter Sunday or the Sunday after Christmas, it will be no different than any other Sunday.

Usually we celebrate them as fun cultural holidays, but we place *zero* religious significance in them.

I cannot speak for the rest of Christendom.


**Edit;** Also, we don't use holy water, symbols, images, or any other such thing in worship.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In the denominatin I grew up in, SS was always the packaged lifeway spiel. I got nothing out of it. I was always way more advanced, and comparing biblical principles to pop culture always annoyed the crap out of me.

Since I have made my journey to Reformed Presbyterianism I have loved SS. We always have very beneficial discussions at my church, our teachers write their own material, I love it. Now I teach our young adult SS class, and it has been wonderful.

I think it depends what circles you run in. Super grounded/confessional churches tend to take their theology way serious, this carries over into small group. This is what I look for in SS.. My experience with more broad evangelical circles has been very different. I am not a fan of the super chill social club SS ideal. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I recently read [this article in the Times](http://mobile.nytimes.com/2013/06/16/books/review/prison-library-at-guantanamo.html?_r=0) (which I know is a little old) and I was struck by a few thoughts, that I thought I would extend to y'all.

1. What do you think about the censorship going on at the Gitmo library? Librarians and library supporters tend to be very anti-censorship, but I am curious if circumstances determine our vehemence? Should we strictly regulate what a society of extremist affiliates are allowed to read?

2. How important is it to have a library in a place like Gitmo?

I would love to hear any other thought's y'all have </TEXT>

	<TEXT> First, I would make a distinction between "will" and "pleasure". I believe it is the will of God to ordain all things (including the judgement of the wicked) for his glory. This does not mean he takes pleasure in their demise.

In regards to Ezekiel 33:11, I believe this is God using human language to describe divine thought. The point ot this text is the individual responsibility of every man for his sin. The point of this text is not an explanation of the redemptive plan of God, but rather a plea for repentance aimed at an ungodly nation.

	<TEXT> Your disconnect is that you see baptism explicitly tied to profession of faith, and we do not. I do not believe any of those references explicitly refer to baptism being predicated by belief. Baptism is tied to the death, burial, and ressurection of Christ in the sense that it identifies the baptized one as a member of the covenant which Christ's sacrifice paid for.

The issue is, fundamentally, we do not interpret a single scirpture about baptism as referring to it being predicated by faith. 1 Cor 11:28-29 are quite obviously referring to believers. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Left Handing Brewing' Milk Stout Nitro.

Stout's are my favorite styles of beer. The Nitrogen bottling makes the beer smooth and velvety. It is full bodied ans bitter in the best possible way.

Also, I am a man. And stouts are manly.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was just using the example of the passover in passing.

The main reason is the aforementioned, 1 Cor. 11:28-29 make it clear that the recipient of the Supper must be able to **examine themselves** and **discern the broken body of the Lord**. 

Those who support PC often claim this verse is referring to being able to discern the supper belonging to the body (i.e. the Church) as opposed to being able to discern/understand that the supper *is* the body of Christ.

	<TEXT> First, it was not his time. He had a plan, and it was one of gradual revelation.

Second, Christ often veils his words in the gospels. He reveals himself to those he chooses, but veils himself to others. He fully intends for the pharisees and jewish leaders to think he is lying, so he can be crucified. He *wants* to be convicted and sent to die. 

I believe it works the same way today. God reveals his gospel to those he chooses, and hardens the reprobate's heart. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Because infants are not capable of examining themselves so as not to partake of the Lord's Supper in an unworthy manner (1 Cor. 11). That is the simple answer.


Baptism is a continuation of circumcision. Obviously infants in the OT were circumcised. 

The Eucharist is a continuation of the Passover supper. Do you think infants partook of the paschal lamb? They were present, of course, just as our infant children are present at the Eucharist, but I doubt they partook.

We believe baptism is a sacrament which does not require anything of the recipient. The Eucharist requires the ability to cognitively examine oneself, as per 1 Cor 11. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In regards to my comment about the regenerate man having free will, I agree with your assessment. I was using "free will" in the same way the OP likely meant (i.e. freedom to choose right from wrong) not in the sense that our will is totally free. The idea of free will is so subjective that it is hard to get across the point.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You don't choose God.

As a Calvinist I affirm the doctrine of predestination. Gid chose his elect before the beginning of the world, died specifically for his elect, and he regenerates his elect. Once a man is regenerate, his will becomes unbound, but unregenerate man has a will that only acts according to his nature.

As a monergist I do not believe man has any part in salvation. </TEXT>
