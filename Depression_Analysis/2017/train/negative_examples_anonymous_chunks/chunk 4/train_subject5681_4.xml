	<TEXT> She's legitimately nuts. I found out shortly after hooking up with her, twice. She held a knife to her ex boyfriends throat when he wanted to sleep for work the next day instead of having sex, I told her that was it between us the next day. I received CONSTANT calls for the next couple days, then it turned occasional calls. Finally, nothing. Fast forward two years, she now has a baby and (to my knowledge at the  time) she had just broken up with her boyfriend. Also at this time, it had been awhile for me and I had a couple drinks. She called me with the sole intention of having sex, so stupid me went and did it....twice again. It was the same thing, oh why don't you wanna be with me until finally she let loose. "Fuck you asshole, my boyfriend will be here any minute and he's gonna know about this!" I laughed directly in her face and saw myself out of there. He calls me twenty minutes later, I told him my side, he ended up staying with her and not really being pissed at me. Fast forward to now (almost ten years since we originally hooked up). In the past year she has contacted me, seemingly friendly. Until she starts asking questions like, "Do you think it could still work between us?" and other stupid, bat-shit crazy things like that. I respond the same way I always have for the past 9 years. "Nah, we are two different people, would've never worked." Today, I just moved from PA to NC the other day, somehow she caught wind and was all "Oh I'm gonna miss you I wish we could've been together, at least one last time before you move." HUNG UP immediately. 


So yea, that bitch is still crazy. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was walking to 7th grade math class when a commotion quickly swept the school, so fast that it seemed like the whole school found out and knew about this in between periods (about 7 minutes). I sat down and the teacher told us that it was now a study hall, and we all just watched the news in shock, and the rest of my classes for the duration of  the day all turned into study hall's while we just watched the news in every class. About halfway through the day, our principal came over the loudspeaker to announced exactly what happened, and that we will have the news on every TV in the building, so we can be up to date with such a brutal moment in our nations history. </TEXT>
