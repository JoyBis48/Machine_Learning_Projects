	<TITLE> The Praxis of My Method </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-03-17 05:13:33 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> The Praxis of My Method, underscored by all necessary humilities and good graces.

Let's jump right into it and grab as many electron rings as we slide down the pipeline of letters, doers, willers, thinkers, feelers, wishers, commanders and demanders...

The state of mastership is to be at all times consciously and positively in receptive and gracious attitude. Open to all good and positive powers to flow through you is a paramount condition, and to direct them in the proper channles of good thoughts, words and deeds the further fruitage of the tree of eternity (the fully restored cosmic ego).

All around us, at all times, are the titanic forces of the entire universe, unique in our present positions, which seek forever to enter into and transmute you and themselves according to laws which can be discovered and harnessed for the good purposes of uplifting the estate of life and sustaining the vitality of being. These transmissions from the infinity expanse of complex diverse forms and minds encounter no resistance when in proper channels from the Master/Mistress of their own Destiny. To find the hidden music of the moment is to establish the master rhythm with the body and from the body back to the world. It relinquishes the dependency on the fetal impressions of the mother and the world at time of conception, pregnancy and delivery (the first causes of all subsequent causal reactions and responses) as well as memory dependence on negative and adverse surroundings, coincidences and influences. This establishment of the master rhythm was accomplished in a variety of elementary procedures in the ancient schools, be they Hebrew baptism, the Babylonian-Dravidian heat tests, the Egyptian endurance tests, or even the somewhat less known tradition of live burial for purposes of feeling the earth itself in full exposure to the earth itself, vaguely popular amongst certain lesser known mystery cults.

Only those who can read this and already understand the value of it without having to do it will be sufficiently advanced to proceed with deeper lessons. Atavistic remonstrance is worth it's weight in immediate experience. Don't re-invent the wheel itself.

In the Great Work of Mastery, the main and the only object is to attain communion with the harmonious creative power of the world and consciously joining the forces for solving the destinies of the Evolution towards Immortal Oneness.

The first steps along this infinite journey involve a mastery of thoughts and through the thoughts a mastering of the body; the dynamic so established releases hidden potentials through the energetic activation of previously energy-starved processes.

Many definitions of mastery exist: to overpower, to subdue, to rule, to possess dominion, superiority and victory of beings conscious of it.

Consider further that man is generally in a state of slavery of one sort or another. Everywhere you look you see people in one state of involuntary bondage after another, and all of them creating more chains to bind those who are not bound like themselves.

This slavery is produced by ignorance on any of the planes of manifestation (the short list being physical, emotional, intellectual and psychic) and any combination there of. Ignorance is imbalance at best, and many other horrible things at worst.

Competition amongst the slaves of the world for the supposed benefits of further bondage has resulted in an almost penal atmosphere, wherein every breath brings anxiety and fear, and thus agitates and depletes the reserves of energy for the body and the mind to function as a healthy union of the forces.

This condition, of pandemic psychosocial slavery is one that must be overpowered, must be subdued, has to have a ruling decision made over it, and be possessed by the dominion of a new system, superior and victorious for Man and the Forces alike, to bring about the revitalizing and vast expansion of expressions of each, to sustain the world and even turn deserts into paradise.

And towards a paradise on Earth one has lent the ears that heard that the words mystic, occult and magick get thrown around pretty commonly today, and so I wanted to recapitulate how I am wont to believe them to mean.

Mysticism is born from careful observation of impressions through supersensitive channels, both biological, psychological and technological. It can be a state of mind alone, but it is also the observation of that state of mind in the midst of being it.

Occultism thus becomes the correct interpretation of that which can't be seen at the same time what is seen is also interpreted as the effects, causes, or side-effects of the invisible properties and objects of the world. It is engaged through a soulful conscious discrimination between assembling data.

Magick must follow suite and make manifest the practical application of mysticism and occultism; the powers of creation, destruction and transmutation in action at the behest of a will possessed of self-solidarity and worldliness to make things happen or not happen according the truth the magician holds at heart.

Yes, so in measure the mother of invention herself embraces those moments when her offspring manifest the 3 overmentalities.
In a word or thrice spoken lesser worlds, finding no other solution to the problem of YOU, decided to feed yourself back to yourself and make you even more YOU, which solved two problems with one philosophy's stone. You couldn't escape yourself, and the world learned all about you while containing you completely in a binding of self-other-self-grammar.

The attempts of the limp world to contain you only fail because it is now seen as a foreign taste which now has to get you to like it too, and you only will if the world becomes you itself, which it will make small concessions too, and progressively, if conditions are correct your central sphere of influence will now have a probability-spreading shell of orbiting factors that serve you because they became you, and being you can't speak to you in anything other than your own voice, so they are themselves mute, and you face the second entrapment.

The breakdown of those orbiting elements in their exposure to an external world that is now less familiar with your ultimate self, is slowly becoming familiar with your extant orbiting self-satellites, and since the world still has to trap you and them it binds them in the same procedure it used to bind you in the beginning. Take heart, the world CANNOT learn, it can only grow and repeat.

Thus you reach the third extension, and the snapping of the leash, that of the world's reflexes becoming your own, and now you can interact with the world through decaying aspects of your own history and new aspects of your present and future, safely for the first time, because now the world can only see itself in you.

Fortunately you think now of an "orange" and the taste of it, and the funny architecture of it, and remember all the arrangements of situations that presented the orange to you, and foresee all the memories of the orange as it is. New tones enter your life and your satellites learn new forms of communication and the amount of acquired information about your universe expands exponentially, taking you to a new level, wherein you become self sustaining in a way that the world no longer can effect.

Thus you have attained a harmonized consciousness. Eternal satisfactions are not yet too far ahead.

It's a series, because if you click the **right arrow** at the top of the page, you will proceed to page 14a, page 14b, page 14c, and so on. The content actually seems to make some sense, and it's a lot of content.

	<TEXT> Here is yet another spinning ying-yang found in the website. This one however, is very hidden. It is found by going to Index 5, then clicking on **The Act of Creation 2**, which leads you to the page below with the ying-yang.

This ying-yang is bigger than the 1st one. However, the mystery is that it's purpose is unknown. When you click it, it just zooms in, disappears, then reappears again. This page in general is mysterious.... all there is is 3 objects, but it is unknown what is the purpose of this page. Any ideas as to what it's purpose may be? Feel free to share. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This page seems to be like some sort of main menu for the website. In the middle is also a glowing and spinning ying-yang; if you click it, it sometimes leads you to Index 5, and sometimes to the Advent Index.... why this happens? I'm not sure. Some links in the website just lead to two different places for some strange reason. You can check it out on the link below.

	<TEXT> Yo, on friday I saw a man on the bus and he was dressed up as a woman!!! Why??? It's not right!! He was Indian, about 35-45 years old, wearing a long woman's jacket, skinny jeans, women's boots with high heels, he was holding a purse, sitting with his legs crossed like a woman, and he even had his hair in a little bun like many girls like to make their hair!! I promise i'm not lying, I really did see this unbelievable sight on the bus on friday february 13, 2015!!!!!  I was laughing my head off for the whole ride, and there were only about 5 other people on the bus, so I was the only one who noticed it since I was sitting at the back! Then the man-woman noticed I was laughing so it turned its head around, and smiled a dreamy smile!!! EWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! {:'-D </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ok, so I was sitting outside, and all of the sudden a moth looking similar to a gypsy moth flew right towards my right forearm and embeded itself into my skin. It was just slightly painful, but the moth's soft texture could be felt when you ran your fingers over it. Why?? Oh why!!?? :D </TEXT>
