	<TITLE> My girlfriend's previous boyfriend cheated on her and gave her chlamydia he acquired from some whore. Should I be the better man or is some kind of retaliation justified?  </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2012-01-21 02:40:48 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> She figured out he was cheating on her about a week after she had gotten an STD test and was clean. She dumped him immediately afterwards and we met about month later. I now have chlamydia and epididymitis because of an admittedly lapse in judgement on my part(bareback).

Her last boyfriend was obviously a huge piece of shit. I trust her story 100% because she got an IUD and had to get tested before that. I had also gotten tested recently and the only girl I have fucked since then is her. I am 99.9999% sure that I am the only guy she has fucked since the breakup, we have a very open and trusting relationship.

I just found out about the STD so obviously emotions are running pretty high. He not only cheated on this girl that I care for a lot but also gave us both chlamydia. What would you do in this situation reddit?

**EDIT**: One of the first times reddit has actually been productive for me instead of counterproductive. Y'all are right I am letting my emotions getting the better of me and this is mostly my fault </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, he has a ton of really mind blowing videos. My favorite is where he somehow subconsciously convinces like 30 mall goers to raise their hands in the air at the same time with just a few announcements over the loudspeaker.

Honestly, I can't help but be skeptical that he didn't stage some of his videos but everything I've watched paints him as a honest down to earth guy who wouldn't stage things just to increase his ratings.

Here's the video if anyone's interested: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOEKdaXIEHc </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Get outside man. Go hiking or something. Go look at nature and try to comprehend the trillions of complex organic reactions that are occurring right before your eyes. Look at the stars and imagine what those little balls of light actually are... how many other planets filled with life must be out there, how insignificant you are in the grand scheme of things. That stuff always trips me out when I'm on acid. </TEXT>

Electrocuting an elephant in front of a crowd of people proves nothing and I'm sure he knew that, its just the general public didn't have much of an understanding of electricity at the time. History certainly doesn't paint him as the type of powerful person who will lie as long as it makes him money. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't get this viewpoint at all. Technology has progressed enough so that things like instant replay can be used in soccer. Sure coming up with rules so that this could be implemented without drastically changing the game play will take a bit of thought but I believe it is possible. 

In this world cup, in almost every single game I've watched, the refs have made at least one bad call that would have been overturned by an instant replay. Why would you resist trying to make the game more fair? That goal England scored yesterday would have drastically changed the game. The disputed goal this article talks about would have drastically changed the game. 

Change is a good thing if it's done right. </TEXT>

http://www.icefilms.info
http://www.ninjavideo.net
http://www.stagevu.com

They all stream videos and if you're trying to keep up with a current show they usually put shows up hours within when they actually air.
