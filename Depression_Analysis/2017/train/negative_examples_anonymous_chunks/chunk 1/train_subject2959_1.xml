	<TEXT> My dad is getting rid of his Pioneer [SC-AK310 speaker system](http://welectronics.com/stereo/sc-ak310.jpg) for a newer upgrade. Could I connect a controller to these such as the DDJ-SX or DDJ-SR? What cable(s) would I need?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Bought [this](http://i.imgur.com/cg6EaRz.jpg) leather belt today, got tricked by the lighting to make me think it was darker. What is a good way to darken it? Would oil rub off on the clothes I wear with it? </TEXT>
