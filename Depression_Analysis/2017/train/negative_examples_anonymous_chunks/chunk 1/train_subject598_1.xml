	<TEXT> I read an interview with Frank Zane a while back. He talked how he would always look in the mirror and see something else to work on and improve, never being satisfied. This is a guy who had what is widely considered one of the most developed physiques of all time, was at the top of the bodybuilding world, and he was never really comfortable with his body even in his prime. Yeah, thats something that can keep you driven in that kind of competitive environment but there is also something really dysfunctional about it.  I think about that sometimes to keep things in perspective.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Torres defense is bullshit.  He may have lined that hit up while Hossa had possession but after the poke check Hossa had time to turn, locate the puck, and take 2 strides. You cant tell me Torres didnt have time to try and avoid contact.  It was late and he clearly launched himself.  Torres was a dirtbag with Vancouver and hes a dirtbag now.

The right rules are in place to stop hits like this. The refs and the league should be embarrassed that there was no call.

	<TEXT> Hes articulating something I think about fairly regularly. Im not a Christian, Im not an atheist either. I consider myself more of a Panenthiest but I sympathize with a lot of the arguments that are made by atheists. However, I have a real problem with the way a lot of atheists approach religious people or religion in general as if there are no distinctions to be made between a everyday religious belief and the most egregious examples of fundamentalist insanity.

	<TEXT> Garth is probably right on this.  Start building muscle first. Take your time and get your routine sorted out. The added muscle will increase your at rest metabolism and make it easier to shed the fat over the long term. Do all the little things that boost your metabolism and get the fat burning going while you are getting bigger. Drink tons of water, eat small high protein meals every 2 to 3 hours, cardio in the morning if possible.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The synoptics are also propagandistic, written by men familiar with Jewish scripture to convince Jewish communities of the day that Jesus was the promised messiah. Performing wonders, especially wonders associated with classic Jewish symbols of divine authority fits with that idea. Saying that performing wonders means Jesus was God still seems like a leap to me. While Jesus was certainly an apocalyptic preacher and taught of an impending judgment by the son of man it is not until the later gospels that  he claims to be this figure. There was an enormous amount of diversity of opinion in the early Christian world as to the nature of Jesus.  Just as a couple examples, some Gnostic communities believed Jesus and the Christ to be two wholly separate entities where Jesus was simply a temporary vessel for this divine spirit which abandoned him at the crucifixion causing him to cry out father why have you forsaken me. Others believed Jesus became the Christ only at his crucifixion. Others, somewhat later, said it was at his baptism. Still later, he was born the Christ.  There is a theological progression in the ancient texts building toward the idea of Jesus as man and God. But it is not fully articulated until nearly a century after his death and not settled as a point of dispute between Christian communities until several centuries after that(if it has truly been settled at all). Start with the earliest Gospel Mark, then Mathew, then Luke, then John and read them horizontally, the progression becomes quite pronounced. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> How about Mathew, Mark and Luke? We dont get any explicit references to the divinity of Jesus until John which was written much later. And just to clarify Im not saying that they state he was not divine, Im just saying that they dont say that he WAS divine. It just seems like a pretty important point to omit given the centrality of the claim to later Christian beliefs.  </TEXT>
