	<TEXT>  It really isn't the entire 1% that's the issue. It's the 1% of the 1%.

It's more of a philosophical issue, rather than an actual practical issue. The .01% should probably pay more taxes. However, the rate that they pay on average as a whole is still substantial. And their 'lack' of taxation does not negatively effect the middle class and lower class. It's not like we raise the tax on the poor when the rich don't pay enough. 

It doesn't feel right - sure. But overall it shouldn't even be a top 10 issue in this country. However since it is an emotional appeal (appealing to anger, jealousy, resentment, and ignorance), it works well for politicians and pundits to dwell on the relative non-issue.

.01% btw is 30,000 people. Not to mention that these are the type of people who would just leave the country if they started to get taxed more (or at least take 90% of their assets to another country).  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> How to avoid an Index out of Bounds Exception </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-04-14 00:01:33 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I have a method where I am passing an index of an array as a parameter. I then want to use that index (int value) to loop through the rest of the array. However the first line of the method is like this:

     public int hasTwoPair(int index) {
         if (cards[index].getValue() == cards[index + 1].getValue()) {
         //problem because index + 1 might be out of bounds

is there a way around this without adding an extra 'if' statement?

You can do this with an incremental or decremental (thats not a word?) loop.

EDIT: but if you want to use a decremental loop, it looks a little cleaner:

    for (int i = 0; i  -100; i--) {
        System.out.println(i+100);

	<TEXT> Sure you get 5%, but you end up paying a 2.5% purchase fee - so at that rate, you are paying a 25x higher rate than the Amex cards I posted. 

9000 pts would cost $9 with this discount.

9000 pts with VCG purchase would cost $45-$50 in purchase fees (I can't remember if it is $4.95 or $5.95 purchase fee for the $200 gift cards).

You save $36-$41 with this discount. Per 9000 points. And you don't have to make 5 trips to Staples/Officemax.  </TEXT>

Also bear in mind that you can downgrade to a Amex Green card. You can get your points, downgrade, and get a pro-rated amount back. You might end up only paying $140 for the annual fee, but still get the bonus. Not to mention you also get TSA Pre for free as well ($100), plus free in flight wifi and Boingo at airports, and Priority Pass Select (free lounges!). </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Can I execute PL/SQL in Tableau?

I basically need to write some PLSQL that returns a table, and pass that table to Tableau. I am copying my problem here:

I am trying to do a query where I combine entries from the same table, but from different schemas. I can do a query to find which schemas in my DB I need to look at.
I'm kind of new to PLSQL, so I'm not sure how to go about doing this. It would look something like this:

Loop (over v_schema)

   select * into myView from

   v_schema.myTableIneed

end loop

so in the end, 'myView' will have the the entries from the table myTableIneed, from multiple schemas.
The other issue, is that there is a chance that the table might not exist in every schema. That's ok, so I would need to handle that exception.
Something like that. I guess I'm not sure how to properly loop, or how I get the list of schemas into the 'v_schemas' variable.

Someone suggested that I use cursors with a procedure. However that might not help me, as I don't think calling a procedure from Tableau could work. I think what I need is an executable block of PLSQL. Please advise. </TEXT>

Thanks for the info. Seems like the bill is too open. "I'm not going to serve you a burger cause your hair isn't covered" is a possibility.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I posted on here a while back that I wanted to get some information from my fantasy league on ESPN.com. I spent some time learning some HTML and PHP basics and started trying to figure out how to post a login on [ESPN here](http://games.espn.go.com/frontpage)

I tried using the code from [this](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11171713/scrape-a-site-content-with-a-secure-login) StackOverflow post, but to no avail.

The problem I think is that the login is actually a popup (or is 'frame' the correct term here?). I'm not sure what to do here. Noob web developer here, so any help is appreciated.  </TEXT>

Actually I just opened a command window and typed 'php' and it said command not found, so I must have done something wrong.

	<TEXT> I got my gas bill this month, and it was more than half of my bill from Dec - Jan. I'm comparing both bills, and you can see [here: snapshot of both bills](http://i61.tinypic.com/e1dv81.jpg), there is an extra line in my last month's bill called 'supplier charges' for an extra $189. What is that from last month? Any ideas? 

Edit: tried calling earlier but got hung up now. At work and wanted to know if anyone had a similar issue. I have Spark Energy as a 3rd party provider (not sure how that works), but I didn't drop them or anything - and they shouldn't be charging me more than PeoplesGas. That's the whole point of switching to them.

	<TITLE> Creating a webpage based on ESPN's Fantasy Football page </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-02-23 17:53:34 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> **My background:** I am a recent CS grad, currently working at a large company doing Java/SQL only (for the time being). I have spent most of my time with Java, but I am familiar with C as well. I dabbled in Python and Haskell as well. Sadly, I have absolutely ZERO experience in HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP, or really anything having to do with web development.

Right now I want to create a webpage based on data that I would pull from my Fantasy Football league on ESPN's website. From what I know, there is no API available from ESPN to access this data. Furthermore, the data I need is specific to MY league - meaning I need to login into my ESPN account to get  this info. I want to take this info, do some simple algorithm, and then simply display a text box on a website.

My question is, what are my options for implementation? I would want to know what would be a way I can implement this, with or without Java. I'm open to learning something new, but I know so little about web development that I honestly don't even know where to start. 

EDIT: To explain what I want to do - I want to create an alternative ranking system for my league. What I would need to be doing is taking the total points scored by each team (each week) - and then run an algorithm to create a NEW ranking/point system. So where on ESPN's website, you might be ranked 3rd, on my ranking system you might be ranked 5th. In order to get this info, I need to access my league and see how many points each team has scored. ESPN's stats and news API is not helpful because I need to know how the teams in **MY** league scored. 

Second Edit: Thanks so much everyone! Looking forward to maybe trying more than 1 way to do this. Just telling me I need a 'scraper' helped. None of this ever came up in school, at all. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I compared my Galaxy Note 4 (LOVE IT) to my wife's iphone 6 plus (thank heavens I don't have to look at that tiny 4 inch screen anymore), and I was a bit shocked at what I noticed.

When looking at something that is supposed to be white, for example, the background of Facebook, I found that my Note 4 is considerably less white. In fact, the parts of the screen that are supposed to be white, look more like 'off-white' or maybe even a slightly yellow tint. 

Has anyone compared their Note 4 to an iPhone 6 plus and noticed this? It made me quite sad. I'm hoping its a defect - although it's been 3 weeks since I bought the phone.

I read a lot of iPhone 6 plus vs. Galaxy Note 4 reviews, and no one mentions this.

Also to note, this is my first time using Reddit. If I have violated reddiquette in some way, please be nice - point it out, but don't get pretentious about it.  </TEXT>
