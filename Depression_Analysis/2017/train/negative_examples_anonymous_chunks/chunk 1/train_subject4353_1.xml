	<TITLE> Help for my first rune pages? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-06-26 22:07:29 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I just recently hit level 20, with around 14k ip saved up to buy tier 3 runes. Im planning to make two basic AD and AP rune pages, and then later specialize. ( I have 4 rune pages) My main problem is what quints should I get for the AD page? I hear things like 2 attack speed quints and 1 ad quint, all AD, all AS, 3 movement quints, lifesteal quints and many other things. What would be best?

My most played roles that use AD are in the order of Top, Jungle, then ADC.

	<TEXT> Sunfire cape is great on champions that deal in extended trades or have a dps ability (like Shyvana or Mundo). For example, sunfire cape is almost always my second item on shyvana (after I build cutlass, and not if I'm against someone like ryze) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As a newer player, I did the same thing when I first started. However i'd advise to go to PVP as immediately as you can. I actually found it easier, as you're facing other new players who make mistakes too, and you learn so much more so much faster. It's also much more fun. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Akali is actually a good and fun champion to play top. If you can capitalize on a mistake early on, or the jungler successfully ganks top, you can easily snowball out of control. Top is easily the most snowbally lane, and Akali is one of the most snowbally champions. Combine them and it can get insane. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've been trying Akali out this week, and i absolutely love her. I am probably going to buy her and start using her a lot. The one major downside to her that i have heard is that she has plenty of troubles once you reach a higher elo. I was just wondering, around what division does her effectiveness fall because of things such as people buying pink wards to counter her, etc.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm a pretty new player to league, and i'm just trying to plan my rune pages for after I hit level 20. At the current moment im just trying to get some basic rune pages set up, and then in the future specialize. The one thing i've noticed in all of my research has been that you should use health seals  over armor seals now. The thing i've been wondering is how much better are they? Is the difference minor enough that i can save the extra 5000 ip for the time being and just use the armor seals, or is it a noticeable enough disadvantage that i should shell out the extra money right off the bat? 

I play top the most, followed by jungle and mid. </TEXT>

Like lets say you won 10 grand, and then subsequently lost it on your next bet, you didn't lose 10 grand, you just didn't gain anything. Of course, its better to play smart and not lose that money in the first place, but if you do, don't worry about it. That's what will cause you to start losing your *actual* money trying to get it back. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Its a war game, and a great one at that. However a big side portion of the game is building up character 'supports', which makes them help eachother in battle more. They can also have children, which are usually the best units in the game. This leads many people to focus purely on the relationship and eugenics side of the game, to try to get the most overpowered kids possible. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey guys, I am a pretty novice FE player (only played Shadow dragon and Awakening), and I have recently decided that I want to grind up my team and try to beat apotheosis. I was just wondering, how neccessary are optimal parent pairings in it? My only kids at the moment (im planning to get them all of course) are Sully!Lucina, Sully!Kjelle, Gregor!Severa, and Gaius!Yarne. Would those kids work well enough or be too subpar? </TEXT>
