	<TEXT> Yeah Queens Wrath was a joke, same content just re-skined pink. Same story missions re-purposed... The Queen requests kills, so go do this completely unrelated story mission. Makes no sense Bungie.

Haven't even tried Iron Banner, not even going to bother... The only thing that made me even remotely interested in the event was that gear and lvl actually matter... Seeing as thats not the case, I really dont care enough to try it. </TEXT>

Guess I won't be doing that seeing as we're now down to 4 hours till release and still no pre load available.

I'm going to take a wild guess here... it's because im in Australia right?

	<TEXT> Destiny, your character, the events in the game... It's all a Vex simulation...

The Grimoire cards for the Vex detail how the VEX are running simulations of reality to better understand and predict human behavior in order to preempt our actions. 

One of the cards calls them the Architects.

While playing the game and you die, if you look in the top right you can sometimes see your cause of death as "The Architects"

Meaning you are indeed inside the Vex simulation and your life was part of the simulation where you failed.

You come back to life because they reload the simulation /  it cuts to another simulation to see what the outcome could have been.

Seeing as the Vex operate out of space and time for all we know everything including your initial resurrection has not happened yet or may never happen... It's just a simulation of one possible outcome.

TL;DR, You're in the matrix.

	<TEXT> So I got around to watching [The dark backward](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101660/) last night and am now looking for similar movies that have a grimy, bleak feeling too it.

The only other movies I can think of that compare are 

[Bad Boy Bubby](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106341/?ref_=nv_sr_1)

and

[Gummo](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119237/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1)


They're intriguing in a weird sort of way, so pass me any other movies you may know in the same vein as above! </TEXT>

	<TITLE> The Pokemon games are a simulation. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-04-12 10:30:52 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> After re-watching the Pokemon series Se01-Ep09 I have come to the conclusion that all the Pokemon games are not real events and are Games/simulations created by the Pokmon Technical Institute in the Pokemon Universe itself.

In the episode: Se01-Ep09 - The School of Hard Knocks. The Students refer to Pokemons Lvls, experience, and when/how they will evolve based on this information, same as the game. As far as I remember they never mention Pokemon in this manner ever again except in the games themselves.

Then they show the Pokemon battle simulator, which is an almost exact replica of the actual Pokemon games battle system.

So my theory is that in the Pokemon universe the Pokemon Technical Institute created the games as a Pokemon trainer simulator based on their research and their battle simulator. They released it as a training simulator to help up and coming trainers learn about pokemon etc. 

This is also supported by the 4th wall comments in some of the games from the Dev team.
such as:

* "I'm the game designer!"

* "I wrote the story!"

* "I'm the graphic artist! I drew you!" or "I'm the graphic designer! I'm a skilled dot artist!"

* "Me? I'm the programmer!".

None of it is real, it's all a game within the Pokemon universe itself.

Or something...

*EDIT*: 

The games have some semblance to the real Pokemon world with the characters and locations etc.
It also makes sense to add Team Rocket and other real world events to show the dangers and characters you'd meet in each region. 
All the while telling a game story thats unrelated to the real world. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Howdy all,  

Recently back in Melbourne after backpacking around Murica for a couple of months, I've scored a job doing outbound cold calling for funeral insurance and needless to say it bites the big one haha.

I have 6 of years experience with Telcos, customer service, tech support, provisioning and more. 

Sooooo anyone here work in any call centers that know of any positions available, possibly pass on my cv?

I've been on seek and Gumtree religiously the last couple of weeks and had no luck so I figured why not see if anyone here can help me get a foot in the door. 

Thanks in advance if anyone can help. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Howdy all, I was recently over in NZ and a friend gave me a PSN card as a going away gift... But seeing as my account is an AUS account I have no use for it..

So I pretty much have a free $30 NZ PSN credit voucher available to give away.

If you have a NZ account and want this credit all you have to do is simply guess the  digit/letter where the "*"is in the code and it's yours!

"*"MQD - D6N9 - GB4A

Best of luck and enjoy


UPDATE: Code has been redeemed buy u/adelope, congratulations! </TEXT>

	<TITLE> How to add Vita to dmz on thomson tg782t </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-08-30 09:53:35 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> My vita has been stuck on NAT3 since I got the thing and can't play anything online.

I've already tried every option regarding port forwarding for the specific games and PSN itself, I've also set a static ip for the vita. 

I was looking through the firewall settings on the Thomson tg782t router and noticed some options for dmz but everything I've tried doesn't seem to work and I lost all Internet connectivity on all devices... which was resolved once I deleted the settings. 

So is there anyone out there that has the same router and knows enough to set up dmz for a specific ip without breaking the entire network itself? 

Or should I just give up and buy an actual good router instead? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Howdy all, I've been playing on and off for a year or so, but never put in any real time or effort... I want to change that haha.

I'll be moving back to Melbourne within the next week odd and was wondering if anyone on here either plays the ol' blues harp and is willing to teach a beginner a few things. Or if anyone knows of any decent priced places that provide harmonica lessons? 

I did have a quick look online but I'm not sure where to start or who/where would be good. 

Any advice is appreciated.

	<TEXT> Afternoon all, 

Sorry for the slow update regarding this... but ya'll know how it is.
The event will be held at [Dash Paintball](http://www.dashpaintball.com.au/front1.html)

Right now Im looking to collect the names and numbers of all that will be attending so I can book in the preferred date and arrange the transport.

So if you are interested throw me a message with your name, number and preferred date for the event.
(I will be going through the old thread and messaging those who said they were interested for confirmation as well.)

I look forward to seeing how many are still interested, hopefully enough to make two teams for a days worth of paintballing awesomeness!

I live central east perth, most know that already but for those that do not, throw me a PM for more details / address etc.

Oh and limited drinks will be supplied but I recommended BYO just incase. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Anyone else notice this? She is completely irrational and unpredictable, her actions towards the Governor have little to no justification or motivation other than she gets a bad vibe from him... And I mean Rick has treated her worse than the Gov ever did... with her personality she wouldn't let that slide, but this fact will be completely ignored for the sake of the story progressing. 

Hell I wouldn't have her around my group incase someone accidentally gave her a wrong look, shed prob off them then disappear into the woods.

At least in the comic she had a damn good reason for doing what she did.
In the show... she's a paranoid mute clusterfuck with a sword...
So far tv Michonne has been a disappointment, other than being fan service for sword zombie kills she's near useless. </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2012-11-17 12:17:55 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Sooo it's me again haha.


I was wondering if there are enough people interested in a Paintball meet up... hopefully there are enough people interested to make up two teams. (you can even make your own team names or logo!)
I think minimum team size should be 4 so we can have a few matches 4 vs 4 but would prefer teams of 6 -8


It will of course be held on a weekend, the date is open and likely not to be till after christmas / new years as most people will have their calendar full at this time of the year. 
I'm just getting in early to see what number of people I can expect before making bookings and everything.


If I can guarantee enough people I will arrange transport to and from the paintball grounds. (I'll rent out a Van or two for the day)


The only expense you will have to cover is the standard fees for the Paintballing itself, usually between $30 to $70+ depending on the amount of paintballs you require.


I was thinking of this location / company for the event:http://www.wasppaintball.com.au/

Unless anyone knows of any others they prefer?


And for the alcoholics among us, I will try to arrange post drinks back in the city somewhere (most likely at Moon   Sixpence) where we can get drunk and regale on the events of the day. 

I would really like to make this into a proper event, make a day out of it, the winning team will even get a Trophy!

Thoughts?

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Howdy all!

Hope everyone is taking advantage of this amazing weather and is getting out and about, not locking themselves indoors on Reddit like myself.

I'm bored and have nothing to do, so it's either loiter around the in city, head to a beach, stay at home or Go Carting!

Anyone interested in coming along? I guess 3-4 people would make it more interesting. 

The only place I know of is in Belmont:
http://www.kartworldbelmont.com.au/
(8 Cowcher Place Belmont WA 6104)

If interested let me know.

*EDIT*
For those interested we'll get this started in about an hour. 1:30pm
So anyone who wants to tag along simply show up at Kartworld around that time.

We of course wont be able to race straight away and will be waiting in the queue so there will be plenty of time for any late comers to slip in.

*Double Edit*
Those who are responsable adults can get there easily with cars, those like me using public transport it will take roughly 40 mins from the city centre and a bit of a walk... just an FYI

	<DATE> 2012-11-13 11:22:33 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Sooo I caved and decided to buy the retail version rather than digital and I tell you what, I am happy I did.. at least now I can return it...

First of all it doesnt require an online pass so this is a major plus for those who may want to share/trade the game with friends.

Now onto my first experience with the online side of the game... I'm yet to be able join a game past the loading screen.
In essence the exact same issues that plagued Resistance: Burning Skies online multiplayer are still present.

The game goes to join, shows matched players and then begins to load... aaaaand then booted back to the main menu, I have repeated this time and time again only to have the same thing, this is present regardless of the game type I choose.(I have rebooted the Vita, double checked my network/router setting and everything is perfect)

So either the servers are at capacity at the moment or the game really is a simple reskin of R:BS, multiplayer issues and all.

In saying that, I'm willing to wait a week incase a patch is released or it is simply the servers being overloaded.

Am I the only one experiencing this issue?


(Side note: My connection is more than adequate for playing online, especially for handheld gaming, I am also on NAT2 on my Vita yet I am unable to join a single game... those familiar with trying to join a game in Burning skies both pre and post patch will know what I mean.) </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Ladies and Gentlemen, 

I present to you a proposition of sorts.

I have been over in Melbourne the last few weeks and will be back in mid next week, as such I would like to arrange a Reddit movie night!

On the 26th of October or the 2nd Of November I would like to host a Horror movie marathon in honour of the night that is all Hallows Eve.
(or the 31st if enough Halloween purists are out there)

- Location: East Perth, Central City at my place.
Enough for 6 people on couches, plus more on various seats.
- Dress code: Casual but dressing up is encouraged.
- Drinks: Will be supplied, beer that is, possibly a ghoulish punch of whatever I find to mix at the time. (Or you can hit one of the three bottle store nearby)

Movie selection will be strictly horror, or any film that induces fear... (Yes Deaditor that includes Spice Girls.)

This will only go ahead if I know for certain enough people will show up.
So I know how much effort or if any effort to put into making this  happen. (decorations etc)

So what say you?
If interested let me know and I'll pass on more details. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Howdy again all,

Since my last attempt at a movie night failed miserably, thought I'd try again this weekend.

Aaaaaand it also turns out this Friday is Friday the 13th, if no one has any plans(curse you folks who know of the dress up parties) I propose a horror movie marathon!
Same details as before, location is central east perth, 2 couchs that should seat about 6, bottle store across the road, bring your own snacks (though pizza being delivered is a very likely possibility)

Basically looking to have a few people over, drink and watch bad movies till he early hours.
Bonus points for keeping the neighbours awake as well.

If interested send me a message, oh and if not enough people show interest I'll call it off and also stop asking haha.
(hoping for at least 3 to 4 people to make it entertaining) </TEXT>

I know this may be late notice but anyone up or a movie night tonight? 
I have no plans and don't feel like going anywhere... so I thought I'd try to drag you guys here XD

the movie night will be at my place over in east perth, central city so its easy to get to.

I have 2 couchs so could seat 6 or so people.(they fold out to beds if required)
Bottle store across the road for any alcoholics that need their medicine XD

I have quite a selection of movies ranging from classics to downright abominations....

If interested shoot me a message, I only ask that you bring snacks and any movies you might want to watch, oh and that your not a troublemaker of course.
(also, I heard there was a snes at notsosillynorwegians movie night? Well I don't have one, only a ps3... but if anyone wants bring one, by all means)

On that note, I look forward to hearing how many/if any are interested, can reschedule for next week if need be.


*Edit*
so this has be rescheduled for next weekend.
If still interested send me a message and ill get back to you with the address etc.

up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, X, O.

It's a variation of the Konami code and it changes the screen filter i.e: lowers the resolution so it looks like doom, inverts the colours, makes it look like ink drawn on white paper etc.... basically keep putting it in to change the look of the game, there's a good 5 or 6 variations.

	<TEXT> Hi Perth Redditers!

Im not sure if you can help, and im sure you get quite a few of these posts on here... but I am in dire straights at the moment and desperately looking for work. So I thought I'd try all avenues, cant hurt right?
I've already done the usual, seek, Gumtree, Hays etc to no avail...


So a bit about myself, im 26, from NZ although I have been in Melbourne for about 5 years or so.
All my previous work experience has been call centre based, fully trained, cert 3 in telecomunications,  cert in QA, training in conflict / dispute management. 
Each position was either Customer Service or Technical support / helpdesk roles.
I have a very professional phone manner, excellent time management skills and high attention to details, proficient in many systems.


Sooooo, if anyone knows of anything along those lines that may not be found in the usual channels to job seekers, as ya know, its often who you know, not what you know.

Or if anyone knows of any positions available doing absolutely anything ill take it...
washing Cars? ill take it.
laying bricks, ill take it.
handing out flyers, ill take it.


As long as its not illegal im willing to do it.

Again not expecting much, but its worth a try right?
Thanks for the time anyone out there may have put in just reading this... even bigger thanks and even a beer for anyone who can help out. </TEXT>
