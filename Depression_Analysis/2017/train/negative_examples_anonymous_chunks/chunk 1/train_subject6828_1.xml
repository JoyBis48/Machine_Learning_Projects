	<TEXT> Norman bates wears what would be considered small town casual attire. However, in the climactic scene, it is revealed that he dresses as his mother. He NEEDS to feel her clothes on his skin to become her. In the final scenes the psychologist or detective(look it up) says that now Norma bates has completely taken over. We see him dressed as Norman but talking as his mother. He no longer needs to wear his mother's clothes to be her.


As for Marion, she basically wears the same clothes throughout the 30 minutes she's on film. Any suggestions I make would be far fetched. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Signs. 

For those of you not aware, this movie is heavily criticized for it's lapses in logic and plot redundancies. Folks argue that suspension of disbelief is too difficult to maintain especially considering the "water" issue. However, I can easily look past those issues and simply enjoy, what is, in my opinion, one of Mel Gibson's best performances. His struggle post grieving/ now athiest on top of raising two children is only compounded by these strange lights and their farm's crop circles. You can see the emotion on his face as he is trying to be stable for his family and eventually admits that he doesn't know what to do. Such a strong performance as well as some genuine scares.

	<TEXT> For example: I work Security and have a structured routine everyday. It gets boring, so I tend to set myself on auto-pilot and think of other things. Crazy part: Like any auto-pilot, there are errors. I got into an argument with him for all of his screw-ups. I know he's just in my head, but as security I get bored and find myself talking to myself. I like to think that in my head I look like Bradley Whitford and my auto-pilot looks like Richard Jenkins from Cabin in the woods.


TL,DR: I, very recently, got into an argument with myself.  </TEXT>
