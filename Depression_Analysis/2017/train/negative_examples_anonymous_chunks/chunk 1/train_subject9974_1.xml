I'm looking for more books with academic wizards. I loved *Jonathan Strange   Mr. Norrell.* I also really loved the portion of *The Name of the Wind* where Kvothe was attending university. I'm looking for more books where wizarding is seen as an academic pursuit, full of Latin phrases, obscure references, cool robes, classes, and **books!**

Can you help me out? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What if a group of wealthy individuals bought a large mass of land. Seeing as it is private property, they can do what they wish right? So they establish a government, much like the US but smaller. They "rent" property out to anyone who wishes to "immigrate". They then regulate environmental practice on this land "it is their private property" and regulate guns, the market, and such (I.e. if you don't obey they kick you off their "private property". They leave a will that states every four years the people must elect a fixed number of people who become "property owners" of this land mass.

Wouldn't this be a state, but completely agreeable with ancap philosophy? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> **I was reading *The Theology of Prayer* by the great Southern Presbyterian Benjamin Palmer, when I came across this quote. Pairs wonderfully with the first question of the Shorter and Larger Catechisms I think.**

"Upon this soul is stamped the seal of the divine attributes. In his intelligence man dimly reflects the divine wisdom; in his affections, the divine benevolence ; in his conscience, the divine rectitude; in his will, the divine power. Such a being can find his true sphere only in God. All these endowments point to that august source from which they are derived, as the only goal to which they can aspire; and the comprehensive act in which they all embark is the homage of an intelligent and eternal worship."

	<TEXT> It seems that the presbytery in whose geographical bounds Leithart is currently ministering in (Evangel Presbytery) has sent a second letter to the presbytery Leithart is a member of (Pacific Northwest Presbytery) regarding his laboring outside the geographical bounds of his own presbytery. 

http://theaquilareport.com/pca-evangel-presbytery-asks-peter-leitharts-presbytery-to-deal-with-his-ministry-status/

I have a few questions.

1. If Leithart is a TE at a CREC church, why is this an issue for the PCA presbytery in whose geographical bounds he is ministering in? Restated; since he isn't working in a PCA church, how does this affect Evangel Presbytery? 

2. Why does it seem the presbyteries are more keen to address his unconformity with the Book of Church Order, while still not addressing his unconformity with the WCF (FV)? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Indentured servitude? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-06-13 18:32:21 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Curious as to what y'all think about the concept of indentured servitude as punishment for nonviolent crimes. To clarify I don't mean *slavery*, at least not in the antebellum sense.

What I mean is, if someone violates your property rights (fraud, theft etc) then they have to work without pay for a period of time.

This could be done two ways

1. The criminal could work for whoevers property rights they violated.

2. The criminal works at a special labor camp.

Of course, it would have to be done humanely. No violations of NAP upon the "prisoners". Feed them, etc. But instead of sending them to a prison where they simply are turned into more violent criminals, we send them to work without wages for a period of time relative to their crime.

Is this a wacky idea? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> "Let us therefore hold it for certain and firmly established that the soul can do without everything except the word of God, without which none at all of its wants are provided for. But, having the word, it is rich and wants for nothing, since that is the word of life, of truth, of light, of peace, of justification, of salvation, of joy, of liberty, of wisdom, of virtue, of grace, of glory, and of every good thing. It is on this account that the prophet in a whole Psalm (Psalm cxix.) and in many other places, sighs for and calls upon the word of God with so many groanings and words.

Again, there is no more cruel stroke of the wrath of God than when He sends a famine of hearing His words (Amos viii. 11), just as there is no greater favour from Him than the sending forth of His word, as it is said, "He sent His word and healed them, and delivered them from their destructions" (Psalm cvii. 20). Christ was sent for no other office than that of the word; and the order of Apostles, that of bishops, and that of the whole body of the clergy, have been called and instituted for no object but the ministry of the word."

Plus, with all the stouts out there to try, I have enough on my to-drink list! About as nontraditional as I typically go is something like a peanut butter milk stout.

Our family does every night. We open with a psalm or hymn, then we will read either a question from the Larger Catechism or the Heidelberg. Afterwards we will get into whatever we are studying. Sometimes we go through a book of the bible, sometimes we explore a particular topic, sometimes we use a book or other material (notably Paul Miller's material). We usually close with prayer time for various and sundry requests. Though we don't have kids yet, when we do we are considering using the New City Catechism. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Roth IRA vs. Indexed Life Insurance </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-05-10 21:46:37 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm 21 years old, trying to start my long term investment vehicle. I'm seriously considering a Roth IRA because of the tax benefits. (I am sure my tax bracket is lower now than it will be when I retire). I've heard a lot lately about Indexed Life Insurance policies and Annuities. It seems they give you a floor so you won't lose money, and you can withdraw the cash benefit anytime. It seems like flashy smoke and mirrors to me. 
   My question is, what do y'all think? Which investment vehicle performs better, and is likely to leave me in a better position at retirement? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It has been explored in a variety of SciFi books/series, but what way do you think it would happen? Through radio? Physical contact? 

I tend to think radiowaves are probably the most likely way they would make contact. Our radio signals are easily picked u and clearly signify intelligent life, and would be one of the first thing a scout would notice about our planet. It makes sense that they would try to contact us through this medium. What do y'all think? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I know it's a huge selection, but fantasy is chock full of magical swords, staffs, wands, and other enchanted goodies each with their own characteristics. Often I find that the props become characters themselves. So If you had to pick a personal arsenal, what items would you have in it?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What's your favorite vehicle of any kind from SciFi? Or, what SciFi vehicle do you think plays such a big part in the story that it becomes a character itself?

I love the Ecto-1 from Ghostbusters, and of course the Serenity from Firefly. </TEXT>
