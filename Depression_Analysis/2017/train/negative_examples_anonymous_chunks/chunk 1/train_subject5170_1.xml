	<TEXT> I think there can be differences of opinion about what the 2nd Amendment is about, but do even those who believe it's about the freedom of individuals to arm themselves against a tyrannical government believe that that right is absolute, and that every person in the country should be able to build an arsenal of every conceivable kind of weapon, regardless of the firepower of the weapon or the criminal history or mental competence of the individual? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> GalantGuy, I agree that the issue is more complex than simply banning assault weapons and I appreciate your reasonableness and civility. I am in favor of being as reality-based, scientific, and results-oriented as possible in trying to solve the problem. 

Studies have shown that violent video games and movies don't seem to increase a person's propensity for killing other people, as does the common-sense observation that they obviously have those things in countries with much lower rates of violence. 

I don't think it's practical to have an armed policeman at every entrance to every school in the country, plus in school parking lots, sporting events, etc. Even if we could do that, kid-shooters could just go elsewhere, like parks, Little League games or Chuckie Cheese.

I don't go for stop and frisk or TSA style screenings. 

I agree that all these measures are overkill. The whole country shouldn't be on lockdown to guard against a relatively few nuts. I do think improved access to mental health and more realistic reporting laws on dangerously unhinged people might help, but even then you have family members who are enablers or in denial, like Nancy Lanza. 

It just seems more logical to me to make the weapons that are designed to kill a lot of people quickly unavailable. I don't see why anyone outside of the military or law enforcement would need those weapons. Mass shootings would still occur from time to time with non-automatic weapons, but at least the killers would be less efficient and a few more people would live.

If we had a way to prevent lightning strikes, wouldn't we try to do that?

	<TEXT> But why would you take out the per capita? Isn't that what matters? 

Also here is how the Daily Beast arrived at the numbers I linked to above:
"Our methodology was simple: Rather than measure the number of guns, we measured the measure of gun deaths per capita in each state, using the most recent data available from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That counted for 75 percent of the ranking. The other 25 percent was derived from the Legal Community Against Violence's state-by-state comparison of firearm laws, which ranks all 50 states by their relatively severity, incorporating everything from policies on mental-health background checks to whether loaded guns are allowed in bars." </TEXT>

A tight-strong player avoids throwing in his chips, saving them for a big hand, which he plays aggressively in hopes of a huge win. A loose-weak player plays lots of hands, bluffing frequently. Tight-weak is the worst of all worlds  when you have a weak hand, you lose, and when you have a strong hand, you fail to maximize your position."

They have made a clear moral choice: that the comfort and emotional reassurance they take from the possession of guns, placed in the balance even against the routine murder of innocent children, is of supreme value. Whatever satisfaction gun owners take from their gunswe know for certain that there is no prudential value in themis more important than childrens lives. Give them credit: life is making moral choices, and thats a moral choice, clearly made."

And why would you take "urban demograhics" out of the equation, anyway? Don't people killed with firearms in the cities count as much as people killed by firearms out in the country? The majority of people in the US live in metropolitan areas, you know, something like 83% I believe.

Yes the US firearms murders are cultural -- the result of a culture in which access to guns is easy. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Occam's Razor. Simplest and least convoluted explanation makes the most sense to me. I also think it's telling that conservatives seem to be interpreting Romney's statement the same way I do --it's not just the liberals who see it that way. But as you say YMMV.

I also think it's interesting that even your interpretation starts from the same assumption Romney does -- that people always vote only from their own financial self-interest.  It says a lot about the way his type of conservatives vote. I can't find the stats now, but read earlier today that twenty years ago 80-some percent of Republicans believed in some sort of government support for the poor, as opposed to 40-some percent now. 

I live in a reasonably high-earning household but I don't support the government giving me a tax break and raising the taxes of the elderly, the young, and the poor so that my family can pay less. I believe in the concept of citizenship and the social compact. The kind of concentration of wealth we have now is not good for our country and will strangle our competitiveness if we allow it to continue.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> While I don't disagree that Congress deserves scrutiny, realistically any changes in seats are going to come at the margins.

The race for president is too close for us to take our eyes off it now. Even if it's true that Reddit is overwhelmingly for Obama (which I see you got some pushback on), hopefully we go out and propagate these news stories and opinion pieces elsewhere as well, in addition to just talking to each other. 

If we support Obama, we should be trying to get helpful articles out there to undecided folk, via facebook or links in emails or whatever means we have. It's about convincing the undecided and about getting likely Obama voters to actually get out there and vote.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't really think that's true. The tax returns are not analogous to the birth certificate.

It is reasonable to expect candidates for president to release their tax returns. It's not reasonable to expect them to repeatedly show a copy of their birth certificate.

The birthers are extreme fringe types asking something of Obama that has not been asked of any other candidate. Those asking for the tax returns include his primary opponents, journalists, and members of his own party who are just asking for information most candidates provide.

Romney saying he won't release any additional returns because opponents would only clamor for more is an excuse, not a reason. If he were to release even five years of returns, reasonable people would probably not ask for more. 

There is obviously something in those returns he doesn't want people to see.  </TEXT>
