	<TEXT> Just to be clear, you are saying that "x broken again" is unacceptable, yes?

it would be if it were the 10th iteration of the same bug in a short period of time, posted to /firefox for the 10th time,  yes. 

How would you feel if it were a PSA? "PSA: x broken again."

shrug, if it's a recurrence of an old bug in a new version of firefox then it would probably be worthwhile 

It's not how **I** feel, the community generally lets it's voice known on the quality of a post/comment in here :) </TEXT>

no, but on the other hand, we shouldn't denigrate less knowledgeable users who ask "x doesn't work, how can I fix it", even if the fix has been posted multiple times (let's face it, NOBODY uses reddit's search feature for such things, especially a n00b).  </TEXT>

thank you, contrary to Ransal's belief, we mods (in the main) just give up our time to help improve reddit in our own little way. These little dramas aren't even worthy of attention generally

 Maybe the janitor.

	<TEXT>  Maybe jumped the ban trigger too quickly but

not so, you're unaware of the back-story, the users' previous modmails in /wtf, /creepy   /gifs etc, this was in NO way jumping the gun. In fact (sigh, I generally don't even respond to these pathetic witch-hunts, but here we go), when he first disputed a post removal in /creepy (a post that was NOT removed), he sent me a PM, even though I had nothing to do with the issue at that point,   I looked into it   politely tried to help him out:

http://i.imgur.com/x0n8CiB.png

didn't work. Notice his insistence that I am actually a dummy account for admin, oh I wish :) And his refusal to believe his post in /creepy was NOT removed, despite multiple mods/screenshots being provided as proof. His paranoia   accusations that mods are liars, in a conspiracy to silence him   so on followed him from that point. I would never have even been involved in any of this if HE had not contacted ME

	<TEXT> I'm no coder, just an end-user :) My workaround is 2 firefox profiles, 1 with modtools installed, for my initial daily logon, where the "y/n" removal is a BOON for prowling all my /new lists for violations,   the 2nd profile has toolbox installed, because toolbox handles auto-bans, "queue-tools"   so on much better than modtools (which is pretty broken). Sadly the 2 don't interact together peaceably, FF slows to a CRAWL if I install toolbox alongside modtools, hence the 2 profiles </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  better install chrome before i kill myself then.

hahaha it's only a browser man, lighten up :) Iirc the problem is firefox reports you have the correct/latest flash but you don't. Grab a clean installer for flash from

http://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/otherversions/

uninstall old version, install that latest version, done </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Actually I was suggesting that upvotes be taken into account when banning people

problem with that is that it is easily rigged, clone accounts, sockpuppets etc, we've seen it all before, too many times. Here's a recent one I sent to admin

http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/2uouse/where_is_entrence_to_the_mario_bross_world/

http://i.imgur.com/zxWAabh.png


every commenter is a 1/0 clone account,   I believe the post got something like 15 or 35 upvotes in minutes, a clumsy attempt at vote-rigging

	<TEXT>  I'm saying you ban people who post a lot of stuff that isn't upvoted.

that's ludicrous   untrue. No mod bans someone simply because they consistently get get downvoted. Keeping on-topic, mods ban people for promoting their own agenda. Nobody begrudges a REDDITOR asking the community to take a look at their site, but if your intent when creating a reddit account is to promote your own content you're a spammer, not a redditor. By the way, you fail the litmus test:

[FAQ:What constitutes spam](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq#wiki_what_constitutes_spam.3F):

If over 10% of your submissions and conversation are your own site/content/affiliate links, you're almost certainly a spammer.

+1, this:

If over 10% of your submissions **and conversation** are your own site/content/affiliate links, you're almost certainly a spammer.

was a ludicrous addition to the FAQ? "And conversation", WTH is that supposed to mean? Feel free to submit 10 post from "myblog.com", it's OK because you have made 200 comments to counterbalance it ? Snort. 10:1 ratio ftw
