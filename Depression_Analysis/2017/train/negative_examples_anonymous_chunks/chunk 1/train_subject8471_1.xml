	<TEXT> Kind of reminds me of the 80yo guy who goes to confession.  He says, "Father, I just slept with this beautiful girl."
"OK.  Let's start at the beginning.  How long since your last confession?"
"I've never been to confession.  I'm not even Catholic."
"Then why are you telling me this?"
"Father, I'm 80 years old.  I'm telling EVERYBODY."

	<TEXT> One night I was out with some friends, and we were waiting on the subway platform, and there was this "performer" singing.  She was terrible.  I mean really bad.  After a few minutes I walked over and offered her $2 if she would *stop* singing until the train came.  She agreed.  My friends were divided into "What an asshole", and "he's my hero" camps.  To this day, I really don't see the problem, but my wife is still embarrassed about it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I second that.  After that, there are some good Wheelock's centered online drill tools:

http://people.hofstra.edu/Ilaria_Marchesi/text/list_exercises_101.htm
(sorry for the headache-inducing color scheme, but it really is the best online drill app).

And this one:
http://web.uvic.ca/hrd/latin/index.htm

And there's a great Latin study group: http://www.quasillum.com/latin/latin-activities.php

You'll also want to get Groton   May's _38 Latin Stories_ which I keep in the bathroom.

I've been self-studying Wheelocks for about a year and a half, and though it's slow going, it's rewarding.

Festina Lente, et Vale!
