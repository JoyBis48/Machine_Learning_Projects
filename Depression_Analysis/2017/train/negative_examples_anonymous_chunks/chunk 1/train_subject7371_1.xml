	<TEXT> I am the brother and I can vouch for this. It was a strange few moments of conversation when everyone discovered that we were back-to-front wipers. However I feel like we stood our ground enough that we put a shadow of doubt in their heads concerning their current wiping methods. I'm confident they tried it our way. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Righties laughing when I tell them that Lefties are the people most discriminated against ever in the world.
