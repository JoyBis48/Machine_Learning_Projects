Seriously though, these 'sound' as though acts of true desperation. It is not as though NK has a lot of allied countries.

Worrisome as the economic situations of the poor keep plummeting in so many places globally. </TEXT>

The Heart Of The World-The Elder Brothers Warning (documentary The Kogi Elder)    http://vimeo.com/103812927   
  About: ""The Heart of The World: Elder Brother's Warning was filmed by Alan Ereira for the BBC in 1991
"In a desperate attempt to prevent further ecological catastrophe and destruction, the Kogi Mamas broke their silence and allowed a small BBC film crew into their isolated mountaintop civilization to hear their message and warning to Younger Brother (those (un)conscious people who mashing up our environment). The subsequent messages and warnings were voiced in this documentary. After the documentary was filmed, the Kogi Mamas returned to their work in isolation and asked outsiders to not come to their land.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Kogi soon realized that their message and warning had not been heeded by Younger Brother, and instead, as they had predicted, many catastrophes occurred and the natural world continued to be devastated at an even more rapid pace.[7] In turn they contacted the same filmmaker twenty years later to give one final message. This became Aluna, a documentary made by the Kogi Mamas themselves in which they give a second warning and say that they have chosen to share their secret sciences with Younger Brother so that Younger Brother can help change the world for the better."

ok I am now lost in the internet discovering these people:)  Will edit if I both find more fun stuff   remember to post.

 That is what you said initially.   
  Then you tossed in a Wiki page, the first sentence of which refers to 'avalanche' as "plausible":"but avalanche damage is considered one of the more plausible explanations for this incident.[4]"

 It goes on: "Possibly negating the avalanche scenario is that investigators saw footprints leading from the campsite, with no obvious avalanche damage noted."

 /u/Iamnotyours makes a very good point regarding these 2 incidents. </TEXT>

 "PETA euthanizes nearly 90 percent of the animals it takes in, a rate often criticized by other animal groups. PETA defends its practices, referring to itself as a shelter of last resort - a place that provides a merciful death for animals too sick, old or otherwise unfit for adoption.

But state regulations call for a minimum holding period of five days, said Debra Griggs, president of the Virginia Federation of Humane Societies. Pickups are also required to be reported to a locality's animal control.

"In Maya's case, PETA did neither of those things," Griggs said. "It's a serious violation."

Aside from that, she said, the video shows "a happy, healthy, sweet dog on its own property, and that flies in the face of everything we believe in - not only about our pets but our property rights in general." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Here is the problem.  Young Michael Brown was a tall, large teenager, he looked like a grow man, ' he was 6' 4" (1.93 m) tall and weighed 292 lb (132 kg).

Mr. Brown was 18 years of age. An adult.

I can understand how intimidating a young man of that size might be.

Michael may or may not have been a bully; reports say he was much better than that, but the video!!

I give my warmest heart felt condolences to his parents, family, friends.

I know of no one with a perfect child; we are each   every one, simply human.

Now why burn down you town?  Honest it is a very bad reflection on the black/white relationships here in the USA.

Please calm down out there, peaceful protest will garner far more support than the videos of a liqueur store being broken into,the toy store, the etc. shops.

sorry  am rambling, it sucked to have to call my son (working in a Newark hospital, just to review the 'if you get stopped by an officer keep your hands in plain site on your steering wheel. If you are asked for ID tell the officer that you will need to reach into you back pocket, ask is that ok?  Always speak respectfully." 

If you should get arrested, call your parents! You are entitled to a call.
Keep your mouth shut until you have  a lawyer, say nothing.

But for goodness sake , the images of looting in the community liqueur store, toy r us, etc you all are setting back race relations like 50 years!! 

Just stop the stupidity, fires do not help.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I paid my rent, gave my son a 125 check   took him out for an inexpensive dinner for his birthday,  ( he is in school). I spent 25$ to renew antiviral, bought some little food, am basically ok atm.

But I am literally down to pennies, and was wondering if I could borrow 35$ from someone until my next pay day, 11/21.

I know many are in much more need, I am happy to have a roof, a wonderful child, lights   internet access, but naturally all my grand planning has left out a few odd things like a prescription renewal, and that cup of coffee I usually buy before my 12 hour work days a couple of times a week. 

I have no idea how this works, how money gets moved about, but scouts honor I will pay back the 35 next Friday the 21st (will probably be after work, like 8pm ish est)

I have had backpackwayne added as a friend for ages, unbeknownst to him, as at one point I was having terrible trouble finding a job that could pay my rent in nyc, and he was so wonderful in offering advice and listening to my laments!  (so now I rent a room in jersey city btw).

Not a druggie, not a drunk, work at low $ job atm, planted daffodils (free from the city), love life, love my family, love tghis sub, and always wish I could help more. 

Anyway I thank you for your consideration. Would be greatly appreciated! (lol though I warn you again, I will need to have it explained how this actually works:)

Thank you all amazing people! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm an American with deep respect for the members of our military. Today I have heard countless people wishing others a "Happy" Veteran's Day. When I think about my great uncle's mustard gas poisoning; what my father saw liberating concentration camps   afterwards, returning with yellow fever from Panama; my brother's stories of being dropped behind enemy lines in Vietnam..well I just weep, and say a very quiet 'thank you'.  I can't seem to bring myself to think of Veteran's Day as 'happy' knowing the hell so many have gone through. While it was still armistice day, I can see people using 'happy', but now? My question is this: What sentiment would you folk like to hear on Veteran's Day, today   in the future?   thank you all. </TEXT>
