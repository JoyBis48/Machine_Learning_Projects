So these are now on my list. Thanks! 
My list is growing, and I'm really focusing on these few words/ sounds. *thumbs up*

I'm currently an Australian learning German, are there any words that I might have this problem with? I'm finding German pronunciation to be quite difficult, particularly 'ch'  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> of course, I wont think of them any differently if they have ASD :) I have worked with autistic (and other disabilities) children before, and adored them all. 
unfortunately, even with that experience, I struggle with the twins. My sister (their mother) told me yesterday that she had to wrap one twin in a blanket and hug him for a while to calm him down because he was trying to destroy the house... I think having to resort to things like that makes her question her parenting. 
we have tried time out, other calming techniques with them, but they don't really work. but i think preventing the tantrums with fun activities is the way to go. 

so I will check out r/autism, might find many more ideas and advice. good suggestion, thank you. 

I have been trying to figure out how to get bean bag supplies and make them before thursday (when i see them next), but maybe I will just get them to throw their teddies instead haha. might be an inside game... 

and thanks for talking, it really is helping, and making me feel a lot more positive about things </TEXT>

	<TEXT> no official diagnosis, although Autism Spectrum has been mentioned. 
They are great kids, I feel bad watching them struggle when their other siblings are doing so well, watching their sister who is 2 years younger than them doing better in a lot of areas than they are is really heartbreaking, and they are at the age now where they are aware of this. It doesn't take much for them to lash out and turn violent from frustration. 
I really like the bean bag idea, it's so simple but seems like something they will enjoy, and I think I could even make the things myself, so that's this weeks project.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hello and thank you!

Yes, they see a speech and physical therapist, so I think they cover a lot in their sessions, speech, enunciation, posture and eating/swallowing etc. 

Thanks for the suggestions, I'm heading off to google to do some research, they really seem like excellent ideas, and I truly appreciate it. 

I just worry about their development, and I know their parents do too, they also go to kindy one day a week which they are benefiting from, but I think more home activities will be really good for them. 

thanks again </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2014-11-30 07:01:22 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi parents,

I'm an aunty to four year old twin boys (and their 6 year old brother and 2 year old sister) 
I babysit them 1-4 days a week while their mother is studying. 

The twins have severe speech delay, they talk at about a 2yo level, although they are intellectually normal, their speech affects their behaviour I believe, they get frustrated very easily and it doesnt take them long to go from quietly playing nicely, to throwing bricks at each other. 

I have no idea how to entertain them, they wont sit still for long, they wont read books with me, they like to throw things, so its hard to play organised games with them, they don't really follow instructions very well. 
They spend most of their time digging in dirt in their backyard and playing with trucks or cars. 

Outside play is good for children, i know, but I feel like for their development they need a variety of activities but I'm just stuck for ideas. 

their parents also have no idea how to entertain them. 

thanks  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A few years ago I was walking my two dogs,  ones a mix breed (monti) and the other a dalmatian (maisie) who was very intelligent and a lovely dog.  
Anyway,  as we were walking monti was a little further ahead of me and maisie, Maisie starts slowly creeping up on monti,  obviously planning to pounce on him. 
As she was getting closer, mont turned around to look at her and she instantly switched to a casual jog, looked away from monti and acted like nothing was going on.  As soon as monti looks away maisie starts her sneaking again.  
This repeated a few more times until maisie got close enough to jump on monti.  
It was hilarious to watch,  I think it really showed a sense of humour and planning beyond what dogs at usually given credit for.

And another:
My parents had two galahs (parrot), both unable to fly that lived in their backyard,  every morning (that I observed) they would sit up on the roof of their cage and watch the sunrise together. Like really just stare out at it and occasionally groom one another.  So romantic.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think a lot of things that are or could be labeled as supernatural could potentially be just othernatural, the universe in infinite and if we consider the possibility of other dimensions, then it will likely be impossible for us to really know or theorise about everything that may exist. 
eg- ghosts, I don't really believe in ghosts as they are described in horror/ popular stories, but I can accept that the chance of them existing in some form is possible. 
We don't really understand conciousness as it is, it might be that our conciousness continues on in some form after we die. maybe then we find out what living in a 2D world is like or something. 

I think I am more supernatural agnostic rather than believe though.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> i guess that if you spent x number of years expecting and believing God will be there for you, you will not easily break that habit. 
I have never believed in Gods, I have never felt the need for external higher power assistance in my life because I know that any help I need will come from the physical world around me, or from me. 

I have always believed that prayers are simply positive thinking, and positive thinking is benefitial, so I don't see anything wrong with you still praying, even if there is no God to answer you.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 1. Grapheme-colour and Sound-motion
2. When I was young, 7-10 maybe, my sister gets some versions of synesthesia also, we were discussing once what colours various numbers were and our other sister didn't know what we were talking about as she doesn't have synesthesia, but it was a few years later in my teens when I learned about synesthesia.
4. It's sort of neutral, doesn't help or hinder most of the time. But the Sound-motion makes me dizzy sometimes and I would gladly do without it. 
5. I sometimes will choose things based on their number, or avoid them for the same reason. eg. I have an appointment for the 20th and not the 21st because 20 is a nicer colour (pastel purple/pink)  than 21 (brown/ green, kinda camo) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi everyone, 
I'm just wondering if anyone else has a negative experience with synesthesia, as I mainly read about it as a positive thing. 

I have mild grapheme-colour synesthesia, which doesn't bother me at all, but I get sound-motion synesthesia really bad sometimes and it makes me feel really dizzy. 

basically, it just sucks, and with all fun forms of synesthesia, I get this one.

	<TEXT> I've pretended to be religious, or at least pretend to not be atheist...which I guess is the same thing... in lesser situations. 
The thing with religious people is they fear losing something (eternal life or whatever) if they renounce their religion, so they would rather die than risk losing that. 
For me, there is no after life, there is only this life, why would I give that up?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> TIFU (a few years ago) when I went to do some shopping, a very frail looking old man came up to me and asked if I could help him with his suspenders-
One strap at the back had come undone.
Being the super helpful member of the community that I am,  I said 'of course!' and clipped the strap back into place.  
The old man turned to look at me with his gentle, sweet old man face,  held my hand and said 'thank you, dear', in his quiet and quivering voice, turned back around and walked off. 

Then I noticed I'd clipped the strap of his suspenders onto his underwear instead of his pants. 
Gave the poor man a wedgie. </TEXT>
