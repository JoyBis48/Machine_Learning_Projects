	<TEXT> Ha.  I thought he just smashed the top tube first then tried sawing it thinking it could be welded back.

I'm guessing he pulled it from the trash (hence the rebar bike stand) or purchased from a police auction where they overbid crap.

I think a professional thief/seller would pull the parts and sell it or put them on another frame.

Maybe I like to think we live in a world where thieves are a bit more savvy. </TEXT>

He can date and marry much further up the Hollywood food chain yet chooses Diane.  Like he's not interested.

It was actually Gordie who signed for less because the Red Wings "weren't making money" and had to sign his teammates too.

Then they leaked Lindsay's contract that was inflated to discredit him and his attempts to unionize.

Howe became a household name.  Lindsay got railroaded by politics. </TEXT>

UFC needs hype-worthy "name" fighters to survive.  Rousey is one of the last one's left.  Concussions, PEDs, gruesome injuries kill their talent quickly.
