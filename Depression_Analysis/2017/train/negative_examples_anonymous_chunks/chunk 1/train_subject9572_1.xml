6.6 billion / 4 million = 1650 so the M87 black hole is a 1650 times more massive than the MW black hole.

I called them up and they said, oh sorry we made a mistake.  Two weeks later same thing happened so I went into the branch.  They looked up my account and said, now Mr. Sheridan, we've had this conversation with you before and this is becoming a recurring problem.  I said, no shit, this is a recurring problem. Now close my account and give me my balance right now. They finally realized there was a different Mr. Sheridan whose account was overdrawn.  It was disturbing they couldn't even keep the accounts of two people with the same last name straight.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not to be argumentative, but dark matter is not the same as a black hole, at least according to the leading theories.  Dark matter appears to be more or less uniformly distributed within each galaxy, not necessarily between the galaxies and not tied up in individual localized black holes.  It is affected by gravity but not other forces such as electromagnetism.  Therefore dark matter is gravitationally attracted to galaxies as is ordinary matter.  

Dark matter is the only explanation scientists have for the orbital velocities of galaxies in clusters and the rotational speed of individual galaxies (spinning on their own axes).  Without the extra unseen mass explained by dark matter, galaxies would not behave as they do as they spin.

The vast majority of the dark matter in the universe is believed to be made up of nonbaryonic particles, and thus not formed out of atoms and not wrapped in the confines of black holes.

Keeping in mind our entire universe is a only ~13 billion years old, it is doubtful the sun and earth, let alone the human race, will even exist if/when it arrives.  Doesn't sound like a practical solution. </TEXT>

I may be a bit biased here but unless you're watching an SD YouTube or other web vid or an oldy, HD is clearly better than SD.  Aspect ratio alone makes a statement on the screen, let alone resolution.  And 5.1 rocks! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> By "accepts wind from any direction" I mean from any direction in the horizontal plane, not from above or below.  This is true because the device is circularly symmetric so wind striking it from N, S, E or W will have the same affect on the turbine's rotation. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yea, would like to see some numbers.  The best we have to go on is "... final costs of about $1.50/watt rated output, which is roughly 2/3 the cost of comparable bladed units."  Not a huge improvement but significant enough to pursue if it can be put to practice. 

I don't think the bladeless turbine needs a swivel base since it accepts wind from any direction unlike a bladed turbine - another advantage for the bladeless design. </TEXT>

They need the break to complete repairs for an electrical failure that occurred in 2008 and to prepare the collider for the maximum 14 TeV collisions.  That'll be when the real sparks fly. </TEXT>

Microsoft has shown an increased vigilance that Apple could learn from. Because Apple has enjoyed decades of small percentage market penetration theyve lulled themselves into thinking theyre more secure, but its really because they havent been attacked. The numbers are growing dramatically, and in my view it's simply a matter of time before the Mac OS experiences a big time hack. This is from a Mac fan boy. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The angle subtended by the black hole would be minuscule compared to the angle subtended by the massive galaxy, assuming the black hole was about midway between the Milky Way and the other galaxy.  This means the black hole would create a very small area of distortion in the image of the galaxy as viewed by a high power telescope (say Hubble).  Although some of the galaxy's image will be directly blocked (absorbed) by the black hole, much of this dark area will be filled in by light being bent (due to gravitational lensing) around the black hole.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Black holes theorized to be at the center of most galaxies are not good candidates for direct observation.  A black hole in the center of a galaxy is obscured by numerous stars, dust and other galactic debris shrouding the center.  That includes the black hole in the center of our galaxy.  Galactic centers are pretty dense areas. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I believe we can estimate the mass of a black hole pretty well for the case you give (a binary system containing a black hole and a star) for the reason you stated.  The path of the visible star is affected in a measurable way.  Scientists can estimate the mass of most visible stars pretty accurately based on distance and brightness.  Given the mass of the visible star and the diameter of its rotation around the unseen object (black hole) they can measure the mass of the black hole fairly accurately.  

I may not understand what you're getting with your comment on the "extra gravity".   You may be thinking that dark matter is matter that falls into a black hole?  If so, that is not dark matter.  Scientists theorize that dark matter is generally distributed around the galaxy and is not localized within black holes.  Although any matter can fall into a black hole (dark or energetic) and increase its mass accordingly.  It's all the same to the black hole.  Once it falls in, it is no longer defined as dark or anything else, it's just added mass to the black hole.

Yes, the black hole's event horizon will increase in size as it becomes more massive and this extra mass is quite measurable when the black hole is paired up with a star.  Other methods can be used to measure a black hole's mass such as gravitation lensing.

Another example of matter that interacts very weakly with other matter is the neutrino.  Neutrinos have almost negligible mass, no charge, travel nearly at the speed of light and do not interact with matter (almost). The mass and speed of neutrinos are still not certain and are being investigated. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Tyson is using the term "us" loosely.  Dark matter does not interact with us as individuals in a way we can measure directly on Earth.  But it does interact with the rest of our Milky Way galaxy and other galaxies as well as larger structures (galaxy clusters).  Astrophysicists have measured the rotation of these galaxies and stars within the galaxies.  They can't explain how the galaxies' rotations occur when they consider only the visible stars.  Keep in mind the rotation is not just the galaxy as a whole but the rotation rates of stars within the galaxies at varying distance from the galactic center. The only explanation that explains the internal rotations is additional mass distributed in and around the galaxies that cannot be seen (dark) and does not interact with electromagnetic energy.

	<TEXT> A solar system reference frame is defined by the Sun not the Earth.  The Earth revolves around the Sun at many thousands of miles per hour.  If the helicopter is fixed with respect to the Sun, the Earth will immediately either slam into it or zoom away from at many thousands of miles per hour (depending on which side of the earth the helicopter is located with respect to the Earth's motion around the Sun) as it revolves around the Sun.  The pilot will either be crushed by the collision or be left in space to suffocate and freeze.  This won't take 12 hours but seconds
 
Did you possibly mean the Earth as the reference frame?  That is the only reference frame where fractions of a day (12 or 24 hrs) come into play. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes, you can have a point fixed in an expanding universe.   Think of an expanding balloon where the surface of the balloon is the reference frame. As the balloon (universe) expands, the point will expand with it.  Locally it will appear fixed but it will be moving away from other fixed points like points on the balloon's surface.  

You don't need to have a center to have a fixed point.  In this analogy, the balloon's surface has no center (the interior of the balloon is not part of the analogy, just the surface).  The same holds true with the universe. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Your scenario about a "fixed point in space" is ambiguous.  Space has many frames of reference: the earth, solar system, galaxy, galaxy cluster, super cluster and universe.  Each of these "space" reference frames moves at a different speed and rotates (and expands) at a different rate.  So first clarify your reference frame ... do you really mean the solar system or the earth or something else as your reference frame?  The answer to your question depends entirely on your reference frame.

When I think of a "fixed point in space", I think of the universe. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When it comes to advancing science at this level we often can't predict what the benefits will be.  Consider when the lasing effect was predicted by Einstein then later confirmed in the 60's through the invention of the laser.  Uses for the laser are almost too many to list but I'm guessing Einstein or the inventor or even the science community at large had no idea what the laser would eventually bring to our world.  </TEXT>
