	<TEXT> Not necessarily, there's a lot of foreign tourists in New York City and a lot of very distracted tourists. Let's face it, when lots of people go on vacation, they seem to turn their common sense off. I've seen it in National Parks, I've seen it in big cities. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> New York City real estate is amazingly insane right now. Lots of very wealthy foreigners (especially from Russia and China) are using it as an investment vehicle, a place to store their money. I was listening to a podcast earlier this year and one of the hosts said that he had a friend who lived in a building in the Chelsea area and he is usually the only person in the building because all of the other apartments are owned by foreigners who are rarely ever there. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Three arrests in the early 1970s for petty crimes such as vandalism and public indecency did not prevent Woodfield from being selected in the 1974 NFL Draft by the Green Bay Packers as a wide receiver, in the 17th round (428th pick). Woodfield tried to establish himself with the Packers during Coach and General Manager Dan Devine's last season but he could not shake his problems with a trip across the country. He signed a contract in February 1974 but was cut during training camp, failing to make the team's final roster. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Can't believe this bs still happens at Baylor. I know it isn't as bad as the decades before I was at Baylor, but still annoys me. Back in the 1990s, my girlfriend was at UT and I typically drove down to Austin every weekend and would crash in her room at Jester. It was a coed floor, so no big deal there. By 2nd year at Baylor I was living at The Centre and various girlfriends of myself and my roommates were always staying over - some practically seemed to live there for periods. We never gave a f about the moral rules or what ever Baylor Admin calls them. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My policy is to use the article's actual title (or at least the suggest title button) whenever possible.  That being said, it is important for everyone to recognize that the headline, or article title, is typically (and historically) written by a copywriter and not the author of the actual article. Considering how newspapers have historically written headlines so as to grab a reader's attention and get the reader to read the article, I feel there has been a little too much handwringing on the internet over "click-bait" lately. </TEXT>

I assume that a Fusion is cheaper than the Ford Police Interceptor/Chevy Caprice PPV/Dodge Charger and in midtown they really don't need a lot of patrol cars with big engines. As for nontraditional cars, I did see a NYPD Chevrolet Volt, but was not able to get a picture of it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The title is a bit misleading. Filming the police is protected by the First Amendment, States cannot legislate around the First Amendment. However, courts do maintain that those filming the police cannot interfere with the police, leaving open what exactly is interfering with police. It appears that this bill is attempting to do that by setting a 100 foot distance requirement. That being said, I think 100 feet is a bit much and I do not support this bill. </TEXT>
