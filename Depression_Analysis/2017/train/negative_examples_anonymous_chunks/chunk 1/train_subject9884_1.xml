	<TEXT> I've got one for you. Maybe not original but at least never heard of it. 

You know how Google Picasa and other softwares ask you to tell them what the name of a face is that the software recognises on your pics? It is linked to a contact in your phone. In case you save your contacts with full name they know the name of that person and their face (also tel no and possibly email,  bla bla bla). Now as soon as the software knows the name and possible waits for a verification from a different user they start tracking where ever that person was. Somebody is taking a picture of something with me in the background? Picasa saves geo data and tells Google where I was that day at that time. This way a map is created of where I went with evidence. Could be used to prove you haven't done this or that but it will only be used against you.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> My trusted salesman at my trusted running equipment shop seriously advised me not to use Nike free runs. What do you think? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-08-12 16:19:52 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I went to a Nike outlet to buy some running shirts and shorts and saw that the Nike Hyperfeel were only 80 so I bought a pair. I ran in them today and I liked it. 

By chance I walked past my usual shop and went in because I was curious what my usual salesman had to say about them. 

Long story short. He said that:
- Nike uses some of the worst foams in the industry which don't provide good support
- He has a ton of customers that came into his shop because they have trouble with their achilles tendon and their knees after using any nike free run shoes. 
- Even walking for long periods of time is bad for knees and achilles tendon. He said that if I run with them (I am quite heavy and mostly land on the back of my foot) I will have problems in the future with my hip and knees
- They basically are a shit shoe that costs nothing to make (he said $2.50 but I am not sure if he was just saying a low number) and is being sold with a ridiculous profit margin thanks to Nike's marketing.
- it has been developed in Germany at the Sporthochschule Koeln and that some people involved make their money with knee replacements
- on top of all of that he does not sell Nike because for him it is a fact that they use child labour (however he does realise that this is a difficult discussion. Anyway it is his shop so it's his choice)

He was able to explain everything very well and I have to say that I believe him but I could not find anything online so I am curious where he gets this information. 

What do you gusy think? </TEXT>

Everybody who opposes Israel is an antisemit. They are calling for solidarity ([here](http://www.tagesspiegel.de/meinung/zentralrat-der-juden-fordert-mehr-solidaritaet-das-hier-ist-deutschland-2014-nicht-1938/10276918.html) in German) which is ridiculous.

	<TEXT> I have been doing bodyweight fitness for a short while now and I really like it. I feel good because I am doing something to improve my body. I cannot yet see a big difference but the fact that I am working out regularly makes a big difference to my state of mind. However, there is a downside. Well, two actually.

1. My thighs have become bigger and now my suits do not fit me anymore. I can almost not wear my trousers anymore when I have my phone and wallet in my pockets. 

2. I am not sure if I am imagining this, but because there is less space available between my thighs and also in my trousers, my testicles started hurting. 

Has anybody had a similar experience? 
Any suggestions how to deal with it? 

BTW second problem is much worse than number 1.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi,

I am trying to use the kernel for the SentinelRom 6.0 provided by the dev

https://github.com/CyanogenMod-11/android_kernel_htc_m7

But I do not know how. I understand that you need the zip and need to flash it in the recovery. I downloaded the zip on that page (right side of the screen) but it always says failed, when I try to flash it. 

Do you guys know how to do it?

Many thanks in advance.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> I was given "the hundred year old man who climbed out of the window and disappeared" as a present and have started reading it. I do not see at all, how this is supposed to be a good book. What do you think? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-06-26 23:13:57 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Like said I got it as a present which is why I am reading it. 

I saw that it has 7000 reviews on amazon.co.uk with 4.5 stars average which I think means that it is a very popular book. Also I heard lots of people talk about it. 

I have read the first 80 pages and really struggle to keep reading. The reasons are:

- The life of the protagonist seems super unrealistic. I read it and think that even though I know it's fiction there is no way I can believe this story or identify myself with it. 
- The jokes he makes seem calculated and also it seems like it's not genuine. It seems like he has taken the kind of humour from somebody else because it was successful.
- Last but not least I read, that he wote a second book which follows the exact same scematic as this one. I dislike that because it lacks heart. 

What do you gusy think? Shall I keep reading? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> What can I expect from bodyweight fitness? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-06-06 19:54:41 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hey guys, 

I have started bodyweight fitness but would like to learn a bit more about the results that I can expect if I am diligent. 

My primary goal is not to gain strength for the sake of it. I would say that I don't lack strength because I have always been working out. I am a little too fat though and I find that I cannot move the way I would like to because of it.

My goal is to get rid of some of my fat and get lean. I do not actually want to get a lot bigger because I have very wide shoulders as it is and I am quite short. I have started the routine that is suggested in one of the top posts (the one that has a picture of all the different progressions in it. I was able to star pretty much everything in the middle.

I would love to know if other people had the same goal and if they succeeded.

Oh, and I want to be able to do one armed push ups, of course. ;)

I'd appreciate any feedback. Progression picks always good </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Is this a possible solution for our never ending universe? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-02-25 11:30:50 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So, I have been reading some books and saw one video trying to explain 11 dimensions. Then I had a though. I am really not good at explaining it but I'll try my best.

Maybe the universe is not actually endless, it is just a closed loop. Imagine somebody who is only able to perceive 1 dimension. his world looks like this ------------ . He can move left and right. If you put both ends of his world together you get a circle. Now if the person would walk left (or right) for long enough he would realise he is living on a cirlce because he will get back to the start. Now if the circle is bigger than the person can travel in a lifetime, he will never get back to the start and will therefore think his universe in endless. 

If you apply the same to a 2D world the person can walk left, right, up and down. Again, his world might seem endless to him, but in fact it might just be a sphere too big for him to travel across in one lifetime. 

Now what if that is the same with our universe? Maybe it is actually folded in such a way that whichever direction you traveled you would eventually get back to Earth. Because we live in it and cannot perceive the next dimension up, our minds cannot picture such a folded 3D object but that doesn't mean its not possible. 

For me this would be much easier to understand that to grasp infinity.

I hope I explained myself good enough for people to understand. 

TL;DR: Universe is not actually infinite, just a folded 3D onject (similar to a circle in 1D and a sphere in 2D). We will just never find out because it is too big for us to travel.
