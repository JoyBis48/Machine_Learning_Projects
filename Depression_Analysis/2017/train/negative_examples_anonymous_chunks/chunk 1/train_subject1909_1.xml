	<TEXT> I would like a good cheap gaming pc. 200 dollars or under if possible. I don't have a lot of money to buy a good pc and am never lucky enough to find anything good at thrift shops. I also would like a pc that could be easily upgraded when i get more money so it would slowly become better and better. Right now i have a 2009 pc with a integrated graphics card, a core 2 duo and 6 gigs of ram. The mother board is to old to support new stuff. Thanks!! </TEXT>

You are an amazing actress and wondered if you were asked to do a voicing role for a video game or a cartoon/English anime dub if you would do it. I don't know if it would be your decision or not because I know hardly anything about the acting industry. Also, who was your favorite actor/actress to work with? (P.S. I love your hair 3 3 3) </TEXT>
