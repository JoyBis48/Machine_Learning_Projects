Now, that being said, it is ultimately up to you how much description you add. Just be sure to get some good beta readers, and trust them if they say you don't need those four pages describing a chair. </TEXT>

This was just a question I had rolling around in my head today when I saw a beautiful woman, natural beauty, not the purely painted kind. She was married as well, as I had helped her husband earlier...just a thought, no intent.

I also thought that, when did it become wrong to do something like this...were we always so afraid?

Sometimes I think too much.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I just went through rotator cuff surgery. Torn tendon.

Doesn't sound as bad as yours does. I was told 6 weeks in a sling, I was out in 4. I was told 6 months before lifting anything, it's been 10 weeks and I am at about %80 strength. Gaining mobility and strength every week. Slow and steady here.

Did it hurt? 

Hell yah.

It's better now though...and I don't have any of the pain that I had before. I wouldn't worry about it. If it hurts now, you will deal with it later. The end result is worth it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> First thing I think I can help you with is...

With reddit it, it erases your formatting. The best way to get it back is to do a double carriage return. That will help make this patch more readable. I had the same problema couple days ago.

Second thing of note, the boy was supposed to be scared, but he sure was talkative. As a personality trait, most people when afraid clam up. A better way to make this come alive is to keep your sentences shorter, and more choppy, when he is speaking.

Other than those little things, I like what I see. You do create a not traditional mermaidimage, but it works. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am a big fan of the -show don't tell- writing style, and your first line starts me on an edge. I can understand the need to tell if you are trying to keep a story as short as possible, but perhaps some more description would spice up the writing.

"The trees surrounded me. Their canopy so thick it was impossible to tell if it was night or day."

Now, that's a simplistic take on what I see, I could be completely wrong if your intent was the opposite.

Just my two bits. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I can try to dredge up some sites. If you do a search on reddit I am fairly confident you will find multiple posts on the subject.

The biggest downside is the time investment, review sights can take months (or longer) to get to your work. Coordinating it all to come together for a big send off is a big commitment.

In case you are wondering, I learned most of this because I made the same mistake on my first releases. Live and learn though. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Reviews can make or break your work. It's best to give out free copies to reviewers and cross your fingers they like it. It's a very hard thing to do, but honest reviews with ups and downs are worth more than gold. 

People don't like taking a chance, even at free.

My best month I had almost 5k free downloads on my works, it resulted in 3 reviews, and one of those was 1 star because he didn't get around to reading it.

	<TEXT> I wish you the best, but for the best exposure, you really need to start the promo at least one month in advance. The more time you have to get ready, the better.

You need to have reviews up and ready.

It's best to have as many blogs as possible showing his work and having interviews or at least something up.

On twitter, you should be doing a contest, a giveaway, something to pull in more readers.

On facebook , goodreads, LinkedIn, and as many other sites as you can get, you need to do pre-posts weeks in advance. Try to drag in as much anticipation as you can.

Local book stores, some hate indie's others are quite open to all others, run a giveaway if you can, and if they let you, try to have some posters up to promote your release day.

Sorry, this is off the top of my head, and typed on my tablet, I am sure I missed a thing or two, but good luck regardless! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The ring of the phone faded into the back of Tara's mind. It was an older phone, heavy, with a rotary dial, and in a shade of light green that was once popular. The color had always reminded her of pea soup, the kind her long past grandmother used to make. The ringing would stop if she left it long enough. It always stopped, and she always ignored it.

Sitting in an old chair, its cover ripped and stained, her arms stretched out, she felt the coarse material under her. Her skin was only a shadow barely seen. A window showed the only light in the room, the faint glow coming through it. She pulled the darkness in close around her, a comfortable friend.

The weatherman had been right about the rain, for once. The steady dripping against her windowsill comforted her in a way she couldn't explain. It tapped out a rhythm matching the heart beating inside her chest. The two intertwined, leaving Tara unsure where one started, and the other ended. The weak light from outside showed the tiny rivers of water cascading down along the glass, hoping to join their brothers and sisters again in a sea of lost friends. The tears they made in their brief visit to her world reminded her of those that fell down her own face. Untouched by humanity, they left only faint traces, as they too escaped to join new friends of a different color, pooling on the floor.

The cold Tara felt was not from the window, or from her dark room. It was a chill from the inside. Others had told their last story and she had drunk the words. Always thirsty for the knowledge they released before the end. She knew this feeling would come, a familiar friend and a welcome one.

Eyelids became heavy for a moment, blurring the window before her, its surface still heavy with rain. She longed to see the heavens one last time, but the streetlight outside stole the night sky from her, the dark clouds blanketing the sky. The faint glow from the street lamp pierced the rain on the glass, creating a million stars shining in front of her eyes, before her slow, tired blink wiped them clear. A smile broke on her lips touched with a blue from her spreading inner cold.

Fingertips painted a slow river of glistening red. They dripped down in a rhythm unlike the rain, painting a poor canvas stretched across the floor. She thought the drops were falling slower than they should. They landed at random, uncaring whether they matched the patterns created around them. A drummer, who played his own beat while the rest of the band played on.

She took a deep breath, and felt sudden warmth. Tara had done all the research, and they hadn't gotten this right. Her fading mind enjoyed the sensation. It spread from inside, like that first sip of a hard drink, a falsehood that promised comfort, but never delivered.

Her eyes were heavy again, and her vision sprinkled with hints of diamonds, the window a blur. The phone rang again, a distant sound, farther than the blood, farther than the rain. They faded as the darkness took over.

The rain stopped.
