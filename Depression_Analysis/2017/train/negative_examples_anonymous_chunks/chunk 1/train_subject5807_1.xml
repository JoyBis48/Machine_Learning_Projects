	<TEXT> Yep. The study was also conducted in vitro, so that could also affect the results. 

What's really interesting here is that short-term exercise produced the hormonal changes with inhibitory effects on cancer cell growth. A previous study showed long-term exercise to have such an effect: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11490320.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In general, science television today is but a shadow of a shadow of its former self. There are a few bright spots of course, like Planet Earth, Mythbusters, and Bill Nye, but for the most part, anything on Science Channel or Animal Planet is garbage.

I just finished watching Carl Sagan's Cosmos for the first time and was blown away.

If you wish to make an apple pie from scratch, you  must first invent the Universe.
