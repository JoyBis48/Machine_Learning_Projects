	<TEXT> Also... it's not a study, it's a seminar paper. And if you look at the actual statistical analysis and the graphs, it is impossible to support this headline at all. The economists found a statistically significant, but weak negative correlation between religiosity and patents per capita. Meanwhile, other factors, such as education, had strong correlations.

Many 'religious areas' (Egypt, Texas) are 'leaving behind' more secular areas (France, New York), according to the graphs. But really -- since when was an area being 'left behind' because it has a low rate of patents per capita? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> New Vegas was full of bugs and glitches. An empty desert is also much less fun to explore than the destroyed ruins of a major city. That is why it got worse reviews. In my opinion, the storyline of New Vegas was far far far better than Fallout 3. But that aspect of the game is really a matter of taste. Some people like the more realistic, morally-ambiguous plot of New Vegas. Others like the more epic, black-and-white plot of FO3. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> PSA: Just because someone is trying to unearth how one particular gender is portrayed and utilized in video games doesn't mean you can't still enjoy those video games or that you are a bad person for enjoying them.

But you might be a bad person if you attack someone for simply trying to take a critical look at one of the most popular forms of modern entertainment. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Tribes:Ascend was getting rave reviews and a flood of free marketing when it first came out. I was able to get many people hooked on the game who had no experience with the Tribes franchise at all. From what I saw, everyone thought it was amazing. 

But I also saw people abandon the game after a few months because they got bored with the lack of variety and the seemingly infinite grind needed to get basic items. A game that is already frustrating for new players should not add to that frustration with a grind. In T:A, you have to either pay good money for items, or play the same damn map over and over again for experience points.

From what I have seen, the game died because of its business model -- not because it was a "niche game." The ONLY complaints I saw (albeit from "casual" players) was the lack of variety and the grind. </TEXT>
