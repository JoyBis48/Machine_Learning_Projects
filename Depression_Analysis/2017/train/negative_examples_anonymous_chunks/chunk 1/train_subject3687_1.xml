No I married him.

Would I recommend that women mate for financial stability? Absolutely. If you are planning on having a child, it is ideal to find an environment where they are going to have a good education so they don't end up perpetuating the cycle of poverty.

	<TEXT> A lot of the hospitals in this area are catholic ones. I am really leaning more towards having a midwife and in the instance that I need medical intervention we have a hospital like two blocks away. I just don't want them to "push" having an epidural, an episiotomy, a cesarean, etc on me when I don't want it.
In addition to the court ordered cesarean, I believe another woman sued for an unwanted episiotomy a few years ago in this area. I just found out about this today while looking for local midwives.  These two cases were enough to seal the deal as far as my not liking hospitals.

I just had a laparoscopy the other day and the nurse ordered me to go to the bathroom after I had already went. I was waiting for like 2 hours and in pain and cranky. This nurse proceeded to argue with me that she didn't want to do a catheter and risk infection. She didn't listen to me that I had literally peed right before she showed up. If they are not going to believe me when I said I peed already, why are they going to believe me when I say I don't want a cesarean?

This hospital was in the same town as the case where they got the court order against the woman not wanting a cesarean. Like I said I just found out about this today and it's not really comforting or soothing my hospital fears at all. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes but when men are conditioned to think -if I buy the diamond ring, the flowers, the fancy dinner, I will get to have sex. Then they start expecting it and it's not okay. It's better for women everywhere to make it clear that we are sexual beings. Not because we want sugar daddies but because we genuinely like having sex, or if we are in a long term relationship because we love the person we are with.

I don't care if you are a doctor, unless my life or the baby's life are in danger you should get my permission before you cut open my body!

	<TEXT> I wish I had waited until I was in a long term commited relationship instead of just having random flings. How long have they been dating?  Personally I wish I would have waited until I was 18 because I was not ready to have protected sex with a long term partner. Instead I ended up with hpv and genital warts which I ended up giving to my first long term partner. Words cannot describe how shitty I felt and I wished I had waited. So please please ask her to use condoms at the very least.   </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> We are supposed to fill out these surveys giving our opinions of the management. I know they don't really want the truth but this is what I would say.    Part time employees should not be getting overtime while the rest of us are having our hours cut to 1 or 2 days a week because we are over on payroll and the manager lets employees work whenever and as long as they want.  I cannot pay my bills with two days a week and yet we just hired more people!  The manager shows up at 7 and consistently leaves by 11.  Employees who have been with the company for years are making the same wages as people who have no experience and were just hired.  It is no wonder why people are quitting for better jobs when they can start off at $14.50.  Most of the employees sit around talking all day and texting while the hard workers run the store, doing their own jobs in addition to everyone else's work, including the manager's. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We are constantly getting people coming into our store or calling and asking for "Frank" or "Joe" or 15 other people who do not and have never worked there. The only thing I can fathom is that if they call the store and we let it ring four times it goes to the call center in arizona. The call center people are morons. They are always scheduling truck reservations for trucks we don't have, hitch appointments on days when there is no hitch mechanic in the store, and generally making our job 50% harder, especially when the customer comes in and we have to tell them that the call center screwed up. We don't really have that truck available. "But the lady on the phone said!"  

Well sir that lady on the phone is a moron. She is over 2000 miles away and is too lazy to look at the computer to see that this particular truck is on the other side of the state.

Anyway, we get this at least once a day. "Is so and so here?"
 Who?

"I talked to so and so."
Nobody by that name works here.
"I just called here and talked to them 5 minutes ago!"

What's better is when after explaining how the call center works the person STILL thinks that one of the employees was the one on the phone and that somehow we are lying to them or playing a trick on them.


TL;DR Just because you talk to someone on the phone doesn't mean they actually work here. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am trying to determine my next snack box subscription.  I got graze and the portions were really small. I wanted to try munchpak or oyatsubox because I love foreign treats and they can often be pretty expensive to ship overseas.  I like that munchpak is less money and has treats from ALL over but I would be pretty mad if I got all/mostly US available snacks. If I wanted that I could walk to the gas station/grocery store.  The oyatsubox seems to be more expensive but it is ALL Japanese candy. I wouldn't have to worry about getting local crap like fritos/skittles/etc.
Has anyone tried one or both of these services? What did you think? Thanks :) </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2013-11-22 03:52:46 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Disclaimer: The following post will probably be disgusting.

Today at work, my coworker alerted me to a problem in the men's bathroom. I had already cleaned it so I sighed and asked him what was wrong.

Someone had taken a dump and left it in the toilet bowl. The men's room smelled horrible.  

I went to investigate.

"Why wouldn't they flush?" I asked myself, sighing.

Hindsight is 20/20 and I have determined that the guilty party had probably, in fact flushed.  

My brave coworker and I marched to the bathroom.  
I held my nostrils closed and flushed.
Nothing.

It won't budge.

My coworker tried flushing.

Nothing.  

I ran from the room, gagging.

The poop was the consistency of glue. It wasn't going anywhere.
It had plans of sticking around for a long, long time.

My coworker suggested pouring bleach on it to facilitate the flushing process.

I ran for the cleaning supplies.

In the meantime my coworker decided to record a video on his phone showing the flushing process and lack of progress.

He said he was going to upload it on youtube.
He was going to title it "It won't go down."

I poured a fuckton of bleach on the offending turd.
It started to disintegrate into a million pieces of stinky disgusting turd.  I repeated the bleach pouring and flushing remedy to no avail.  Maybe, I thought, maybe I'll let it set for a while so the bleach can really soak in there.

I made a sign. Out of order. Please use women's restroom.
Sorry!  I taped it to the door.

Did I mention I sprayed a ton of air freshener??

I think we should like, poke it with a stick, I told my coworker.

That's disgusting, he replied. 

Yes, yes it is, I thought.

Somehow I've gotta clean this thing.

I googled "poop won't flush" but did not come up with a cure-all solution.  I started looking for something to poke the poo with.  Eventually after half a gallon of bleach and 20 flushes the poop finally SLID down the hole.
It left the hugest shitstained bowl I've ever seen.

After much plunging and toilet bowl cleaner soaking
and toilet bowl scrubber scrubbing, I finally defeated the shit demon.


I felt like a champion.


I left the door propped open so the bathroom would air out.

Still I warned everyone to use the ladies' room. </TEXT>

Currently my husband uses gilette fusion and I am using venus.  We got him 4 store brand refills for $5 but they don't fit on the actual gilette fusion, so we're going to have to pay 7.99 to buy the damn generic razor.  Other than buying disposable bic soleils, I'm out of ideas.
How can I get cheaper razor blades? I'm sick of spending $30 total every time we need refill blades .

	<TEXT> I forgot to make an into post!

I am a married 28 y/o from Scranton, PA

I work at a storage /moving truck rental company with a bunch of guys and don't really have time for much makeup before work.  Normally I just do eyeliner, bb cream, and some kind of lip balm/gloss. Also I have to clean out storage units all day so by the end of the day I am gross and exhausted.  I am really in love with any kind of foot scrub because my feet get really sore from being on my feet all day.
I also use a lot of makeup/cleansing wipes at work when I get a chance
and I get really dry hands from cleaning products so I always have some kind of hand cream/lotion in my purse. 

On my day off I normally just catch up on house cleaning. Occasionally I still like to glam up however it's not as often as I'd like. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Anyone else on spironolactone? Also: Tria laser hair removal </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-10-30 03:19:25 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I started taking spironolactone two weeks ago because I have high testosterone and hirsutism / acne.  I am only on 25 mg twice a day. I did some online searches and it seems like the typical dose for acne is 100 mg while for overweight patients and those with excessive facial hair the dosage may be 250-300 mg.  I'm thinking about calling my endocrinologist to see if he will up my dosage. But from what I've read it can take up to two months to see results. So far my face is still broken out and I'm still having to shave every day, sometimes twice. :(


Also I am looking into getting a Tria hair removal laser for Christmas. It's supposed to be the closest to professional laser removal you can get at home.  I don't have the money to go get it done and it's too embarassing, I'd rather do it at home. I've already had to shave my face every day for the past 5 years, I hope something can be done. Even if it's not permanent if it just slows the hair growth it would be worth $450. It is a pretty big investment though, and if it doesn't work I don't know if I'll be able to get a refund.

Does anyone have any experience with either of these? Has anyone had any success with  getting rid of unwanted facial hair ?
I'm also on birth control so the spiro combined with that should reduce my acne but the facial hair is my biggest concern. </TEXT>

Anyway just wondering if anyone has any experience. Thanks! </TEXT>
