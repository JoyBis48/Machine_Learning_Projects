	<TEXT> Hey guys, I know there are the two movie theaters in Morrisville that do $5 movies (one on Tuesday and the other between 4-6 everyday.) Does anyone know of any other places around the triangle that has special discounts on certain days or shows cheap movies?

	<DATE> 2014-01-17 18:01:48 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Since a lot of people are coming in with a couple of thousand words written, consider using this additional rule for the challenge: extra words written in a certain week don't carry over. So even if you have 1,000 words written and you are ahead for week 1 (100 words written), this count doesn't carry over and you STILL have to write 200 words for week 2. 

Just my two cents.   </TEXT>

	<TITLE> The 52 Week Writing Challenge [More Details Inside] </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-01-17 00:07:35 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> **TL;DR up top: I invite everyone to join me on my 52 Week Writing Challenge. Every week you will write 100 more words than the week before... so that at the end of 52 weeks of continuous writing, you will have produced 137,800 written words, equivalent to a 500+ novel.**

It's simple: start small, build a routine, form the habit, and WRITE.

We're all aspiring writers here. But it's not a secret that it's hard to find time to sit down and actually commit to writing after a long day at the office or a long night of homework and so you tell yourself "Oh, I'll do it tomorrow". Well, eventually tomorrow turns into next week and next week turns into next month, and sure enough - *another year has gone by*. 

But there's Nanowrimo you say. True, but for someone who writes a few thousand words every couple of months, the idea of finishing 50,000 words in one month is *absolutely daunting*. That's an average of 1,666 words everyday!

So how exactly do we become comfortable with doing this? Practice. Routine. You do it so many times that your brain just does it unconsciously and naturally. Think about it... from touch typing in the dark to playing the unmarked strings of a violin, these are not things that were picked up or developed in a day. It was drilled in through sheer repetition and routine. That's what I hope to accomplish this year with my writing challenge. 

Start small. No one started by playing Beethoven concertos... we all have to begin with Twinkle Twinkle Little Star or Mary Had a Little Lamb or something equally mundane. Start small and easy and repeat and gradually build on it.  

So I was inspired by the slew of new year's posts on reddit by proud people who had just completed the 52 Week Money Challenge (which was in turn originally inspired by the following [blog post](http://savingabuck.com/2013/01/try-the-52-week-money-challenge-for-2013/).) I decided to tweak this for my own purposes. 

**So it's simple.** Week 1, you will write 100 words. Easy-peasy, right? Awesome. Week 2, you will write 200 words. Psh, still easy. Week 3, write 300 words... you see where I'm going with this right? **Every week you will write 100 more words than the week before... so that at the end of 2014 and at the end of 52 weeks of continuous writing, you will have produced 137,800 written words, equivalent to a 500+ novel.**

**With that said, I would like to invite everyone here at /r/writing to join me in this challenge.**

So at the end of this year, **we** will all not only have written a complete novel but more importantly we will have developed a consistent weekly routine of writing so that the next 100,000 words will come so quickly and so simply we will look back and wonder what exactly was holding us back all those years ago. 

Personally, I'll be starting a [blog](http://52weekwritingchallenge.blogspot.com/) to chronicle this (mis)adventure though I will be posting to this subreddit regularly as well. I'm putting myself out there so that I might feel some sort of accountability on my part to actually stick this out throughout the rest of the year. 

For those who want to keep track of their writing and word counts throughout the year, here is a copy of a [simple template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AsFevF2WQhWsdEN6VEVtWnJfQVpUanZGaHFGNE5sLUE usp=sharing) I created for myself. You can copy and paste it onto your own file if you want to use it.

(I know it's already 1/16 and we've already missed the first two weeks worth of writing! Well, I will be doing a little catch up this week to catch up to week 3, but feel free to start your challenge ANY TIME and go for 52 weeks!) 

EDIT: So some people have expressed interest in creating a separate group to track progress and/or engage with each other. Personally, I will only posting snippets but I think checking in with each other to make sure we're all on track is a good idea. If you are interested, **please join /r/52wkwritingchallenge**! Otherwise, feel free to use the google spreadsheet above to track your progress yourself!

EDIT 2: Since a lot of people are coming in with a couple of thousand words written, **consider using this additional rule for the challenge: extra words written in a certain week don't carry over.** So even if you have 1,000 words written and you are ahead for week 1 (100 words written), this count doesn't carry over and you STILL have to write 200 words for week 2. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Recently bought a house - question on AC issues/leak on upstairs unit </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-08-21 13:32:24 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hey all - I recently bought a short sale and it was sold as-is with some issues to the upstairs AC. It's not blowing cold air and I got a service guy to come out and he said there was a leak and I was low on roughly two pounds of refrigerant (it's a 2.5 ton split unit). He also said it was most likely the coil which would cost roughly $1500 to replace (and I did not have him perform the leak search.) The guy said I could try to fill it up with refrigerant but if the leak was bad, it would just quickly leak out again. 

My question is this - since the house was unoccupied (and power was shut off) for about 6-8 months before I moved in do you guys think that the leak is actually somewhat small and it was mostly due to the AC being off for a long period of time? (The guy told me that ACs with leaks will actually lose more refrigerant when off as opposed to on.) I was thinking of just adding some refrigerant for now to get it up and running. I have alot of other house related expenses and I'd rather not repair for $1500 or replace for $5000... 

Also, bonus question - I got quoted $5300 for a 13 SEER Carrier and $6900 for a 16 SEER Carrier (in Raleigh, NC). Are those prices somewhat in line with what's to be expected? Also, heard prices for replacement might be cheaper in the fall - should I hold off if I do elect to go the replacement route? How much cheaper would it be? 

Thanks for any help with this!  </TEXT>

Second, the bathtub has a small missing ding in it. What's the best way to fill it and cover up? It's on the far side of the tub so water leakage isn't a major concern.

A little background: house was built in 1999, no structural issues. 

1. Would I be able to to just replace the warped boards by removing the individual boards and getting a new piece to replace at say Lowe's? Is this as simple as it getting them up and screwing in new boards?
2. What is the best way to seal the deck and prevent this from happening in the future?

I'm a total DIY beginner but I have been reading up and watching videos on the tiling BUT I just want to run through my plan and ask questions beforehand to make sure nothing goes wrong. Just for reference, house is from 1999 so fairly new. 

Currently there is vinyl in the kitchen (which looks like is over plywood - http://imgur.com/AGbdy4t ):

1. Score vinyl with utility cutter. 
2. Peel up. 
3. Remove plywood (EDIT: someone said there's probably plywood there and needs to be removed) 

Now for actual flooring: 

1. Use modified thinset between subfloor and Ditra. Spread and stick it on. 
2. Use non-modified thinset above between Ditra and tile. (But must use latex additive for porcelain tile? Does it apply to ceramic as well?) 

Some general questions: 

1. How long does it take to dry between all the layers? I've heard it takes awhile - up to a week?
2. How do I tile around/cut the tile to work for this vent? (By the window - http://imgur.com/3o1Zk0W) I have read some stuff about using a wetsaw, but is there no other way to do it? I am planning on using a snapper.
3. I am planning on doing a diagonal pattern, are there any guidelines or suggestions where to start? (For example, for just straight squares it is recommended you start in the center and work outwards.) 
4. If I decide to go with Wonderboard instead, do I need pay attention to how I screw it down? Or just evenly spaced works? 

I would also like any recommendations on the following tools: 

-Tile snapper (or saw if that's better) 

-Modified Thinset (Someone recommended Versabond) 

-Unmodified Thinset (Someone recommended Laticrete ? on the actual one) 

-Places to buy cheap tile? (The best I've found is .86 ceramic tile that's on sale at HD) 

Is there anything else I've forgotten or failed to think of? 

Thanks for any and all help!! </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Want Some Manga Recs (from 2009+ onwards) </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-06-25 07:01:15 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hey guys, I used to read a lot of manga when I was high school, but pretty much stopped once I got to college. I recently caught myself up with Billy Bat and it just reminded me of how awesome manga can be. So I'm looking for recommendations of newer series, specifically ones that started after 2009. I'm slightly flexible on this but try not to recommend things that started way before this date bc changes are I will have read it or heard of it already. 

I read pretty much any genre, though I like plot/character driven ones and dislike mangas that are super fanservice-y. 

To give you some idea of things I liked from before: FMA, Rurouni Kenshin, anything by Naoki Urasawa, One Piece, Death Note, Flame of Recca, Eden, Jiraishin, Goth, Black Lagoon, anything by Kaori Yuki, stuff by CLAMP, Bleach, Anatolia Story/Red River, Basara, 7 Seeds, Hikaru no Go, Prince of Tennis, random things by Mitsuru Adachi, Hana Yori Dango, Hanakimi, Ouran High School Host Club. This is just off the top of my head to give you a sampling of mangas that've enjoyed in the past. 

Appreciate any recs! Thanks!  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [Question] Started wearing makeup regularly for work - is it causing my skin blemishes, etc? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-06-20 20:15:29 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hey guys, I'm not much of a makeup user, but I started wearing makeup regularly for work (9-5 everyday) after college and I've noticed that my skin has now has blemishes and bumps and just other general imperfections that definitely didn't exist before. I've never broken out and it doesn't turn red or irritated, but my skin was definitely much clearer and smoother before I started regularly using makeup. My mom's has commented on this several times whenever I visit so I don't think it's just me. 

Since I'm no make expert, do you guys think it's the quality of the makeup I'm using? Or maybe the brands I'm using is not good for my skin? My skin is not particularly oily or dry, though it does very occasionally get dry. 

My usual face make up is L'Oreal powder foundation and Milani blush. I almost always take it off immediately after work using baby wipes. (I didn't start using baby wipes until about a year ago, but do you guys think that might have also contributed a little? I used to use Target brand make up remover wipes.)  

I'll take any suggestions, comments or even recommendations for different brands. If it makes a difference, I'm Asian and have had fairly good skin in the past (never really any break outs, acne, etc).  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Best way to alter a dress that's a bit too small? (pictures/details inside) </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-06-16 21:03:02 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi guys, so I recently bought an olive dress at H M that is just a little bit too small. It was on sale and I loved it so I said why not. It zips up in the back, but my entire torso feels like it's in a corset - chest and stomach areas are being completely compressed and in a way thats not acceptable to wear out in public. 

I probably need half an inch around the waist and maybe a little more around the chest area (I can get these measured when I take it to tailor's). Since they'll probably need to add fabric to it and I feel like it's going to be pretty hard, if not impossible to find fabric that matches the dress, **where and what do you guys think is the best to add onto this dress to make it bigger?** I was thinking a stretchy black strip down the back where the zipper is or possibly along the sides under the arm. This only needs to be added to the torso part of the dress. 

Here are some pictures of me wearing it (a bit hard to see the bad fit due to the light): [Here](http://imgur.com/a/bdVQ7/)  

Here are some more pics of the dress I found online (clearer pictures): [Here](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-LLl5FSNPwiw/UVh3qXxPg4I/AAAAAAAAEcQ/vLi4X97Booo/s1600/h m+olive+sheath+dress+.jpg)

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hey guys, I'll probably be heading to Shanghai sometime this year or next year - wondering if anyone had any recommendations for a good (and relatively cheap) place to get glamor shots? Specifically I mean the places where they do all your makeup, have a wardrobe, do the touchup and usually give you a book and also a large print afterwards.

By cheap, I mean  cheap on American standards so I'm looking for maybe the $300-$500 range? Is that sound reasonable? But if you have good places that are more than that - please shoot those over too. 

Thanks!  </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2013-05-09 16:31:24 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> The situation: I found a short sale that I really liked about 2-3 weeks ago and I put an offer in on it (full asking price with conventional loan 20% down). I found out yesterday that there is now an all cash offer that is "in line" with my offer (which I assume is a little lower but close to my offer). My realtor says that banks/sellers look very favorably on all cash offers just because there are no contingencies or risk involved. 

Is the bank really more likely to take a 250k cash offer over a 260k financed offer? Don't they get the money anyways in one go? Do I just need to prove I am no risk buyer? 

I really like this house and would like to get it. Can you guys give me some advice/help on a couple of things: 

* Does the bank consider my offer first since I submitted it 2-3 weeks ago or will they look at both with equal consideration? 
* If I increase my % down to 40-50% or get a 15 yr mortgage, will that help show that I am more than financially capable of buying and I am strong serious buyer? Will that hold up at all against the cash offer at all? 
* Will increasing my offer by 5k (it's a 260k house) be more of a draw than the above method? 
* Would it be completely not ok if I tracked down the seller himself and just flat out asked him what price the other cash offer was so I can compete directly with it? 

I appreciate any help guys.  </TEXT>

I'm fairly clueless when it comes to whiskey - the closest I ever get is a nice Old Fashioned or Washington Apple. I know he has a bottle of Auchentoshan right now that he's been drinking and he seems to like that. He's mentioned that he likes Jameson and that he dislikes Johnny Walker (because it had a weird taste to him?). 

I don't really understand the differences, can you guys give me some recs on what to buy him based on the above? And nothing that will break the bank please. If you could split your recs into whiskeys under $50 and those between $50-$100 that would be great. Thanks!! :) </TEXT>

I'm planning on living in this place for the first couple of years and then renting it out afterwards. My current thoughts are Cary because it will hold value (but houses are a little more pricey and it's suburbia) or downtown Raleigh (much older, small homes but rent to young professionals due to location). Plus, Raleigh is consistently ranked as highest growing/best for professionals/etc city in US so I wonder if buying there is better in the long term if I'm planning on holding onto this place for 10-20 years? Do you think Cary value will experience the same sort of bump because of Raleigh being up and coming?  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Affordable funeral/cremation services? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> My grandfather passed away earlier today and my parents don't really know where to start. They wish to cremate my grandfather's remains but we also need a small service/showing (I'm not really sure how this works) beforehand (just for 6 of us, nothing fancy required). My parents need a place that's affordable. We live around Palmetto Bay/Pinecrest. Any advice or recommendations would be extremely helpful.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey guys - has it been confirmed if all 4 DLCs will have zombie maps? I'm debating whether or not to buy this if my sole reason for getting the DLCs is the zombie maps. (And I already have Nuketown.) I don't want to wind up paying more if one of these 4 doesn't have a zombie map. 

Thanks! </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Question: Does the highest rounds not save if someone backs out?  </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2012-12-22 22:41:30 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I've been running into this problem lately where half the time my highest rounds won't save on any random map (this has happened on Town and Nuketown so far). Other than the game/network being messed up, my theory is that if someone backs out halfway through, it won't save the highest round. FYI, I'm playing on PSN. 

Can someone confirm or deny this?
