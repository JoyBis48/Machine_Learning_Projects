	<TEXT> I want to start lifting, but not very familiar with proper form and safety.  Does anyone have tips, guidelines, or any good (preferably free) resources online.  I have a very physical job in a brewery and figured I might as well bulk up to make work easier as well as other things </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I really want to bulk up and get big.  Would like someone I can rely on as a spotter who has some experience power lifting.  I'm starting out at level 1 so I need someone who's patient.  I want a motiator and not a douchey gym rat.  I work at a brewery and have 3 very clear goal.

1)  Make my life lifting and moving kegs a lot easier

2)  Throw a shot put A LOT further.

3)  Make my cheating ex girlfriend sorry she left me for a stoner who works the register at a fast food joint.

I have a 24 hour fitness membership and will be working out probably after or around 8pm.  I'm motivated and committed but not knowledgeable in lifting, safety, form, all that good stuff.  If you're looking for a work out buddy, hit me up. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I highly recommend Kayden DiGiovanni at the Skin Art Gallery in Addison.  Check him out at DallasTattoo.net  I have quite  bit of work done, the only 2 I wasn't satisfied with are the ones he did NOT do, and he still even helped me out with them (I've been going to him for 9 years)  Also chek him out at facebook.com/dallastattoo </TEXT>

	<TEXT> ot me beat.  3lbs most I've done.  I was cooing in a restaurant going out of business and the last day we were open my Chef "cleaned out the walk in"  it was a race between myself and the food runner on a 3lb plate.  The volume was rough, but forcing it down fast was far worse. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> nice, my buddies and I have worked with ghost peppers before.  We had a dick coworker who caused problems (we were all chefs in training) so we steeped ghost peppers in water and used that to make a dense gelatin and put his knives in it them set it in the cooler over night.  Highly recommend trying it some time.

But thanks, I'll have to check it out, I work right around the corner from there.  How many wings does one have to polish off? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> "allow it" to happen for a while, put up remote surveillance camera's in your house that you can view from the web or your smart phone.  Use this to file for divorce, leaving her penniless.  Once he paper work is ready, hang onto it.  Wait for her to have her ex over one day.  While their sleeping in your bed together, sneak into your own house with another woman.  MAKE SURE SHE IS HOTTER THAN YOU PHILANDERING WIFE.  She could be an ex, some girl at the bar, a co-worker, a hooker, it doesn't matter.  Drop the paper work on the coffee table while being un-heard, then start going at it as rough and as loud as possible.

Really make it loud.  When your wife comes out with her ex, don't stop, just smile.  With one hand give a thumbs up, the other hold up divorce papers.

She'll get the point.  After a while there's not much that'll fill the void from being hurt by your ex, but bourbon will help.

	<TEXT> Go for a small dice and when you sautee your mire poix go for a darker carmelization (careful not to burn)  You should get a sweeter taste.  I like to use this in my marinare and pizza sauce.  2 carrots, 2 stalks of celery and 1 onion, 2 garlic cloves 1/2 cup olive oil, 2 16 oz cans of tomato puree and 1 small can of dice tomatoes.  Simmer the mire poix and garlic, add tomatoes and cook out for 2 hours, season.  For marinara leave be, for pizza sauce blend.  Pretty tasty, and if you blend she'll never know it's there. </TEXT>
