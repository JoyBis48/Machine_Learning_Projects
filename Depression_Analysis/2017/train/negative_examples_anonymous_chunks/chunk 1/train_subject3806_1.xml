	<TEXT> If you want to give it a shot before buying a slow feed bowl, put a ball in the bowl. He'll need to move it around to get at the kibble.

Now, if it's aggression of the sort that he'll bite your hand if you reach your hand near him (try with a broom and a glove on the end), that's a real problem. If he doesn't bite, notice whether he freezes up or growls, because those are precursor behaviors. Any of this stuff, and you should consult an animal behaviorist. I'd recommend asking at your local SPCA or Humane Society, because they are very used to dealing with food aggressive dogs. The hand-near-the-bowl test is one that gets done with all surrendered or stray dogs, and it can be a deal-breaker in terms of whether the dog goes up for adoption or gets euthanized. They should know behaviorists who are used to working with people whose dogs have food aggression problems. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Fair, fair, you didn't say that. I also didn't say the market was the sole cause. The problems we face with health care are obviously very, very complicated. But it also doesn't make sense to ignore the multiple competing interests and parties involved in designing the ACA and in rolling it out when we say things like "the ACA is a disaster." 

I suppose I just don't see how we can have BOTH a for-profit health care industry and a governmental attempt to lower cost and spread coverage to more people at the expense of industry profit. The incentives are at cross-purposes.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Be clear: for-profit, market-based health care is causing chaos, and intentionally causing chaos to undermine what the ACA tries to achieve. If only our elected officials hadn't given over one of the most important pieces of legislation in history to the health insurance lobby none of this would be happening. If we had a public option, which so many people called for and Congress + Obama failed to deliver, none of this would be happening. The industry is doing everything it can to make this roll-out a disaster. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Absolutely. Definitely a concern. The example of this kind of monitoring I can think of is CPAP machines for sleep apnea. The machine records your hourly usage, which the insurance company calls "compliance." Obviously, the clinical benefit is that you know whether you unknowingly take the mask off at night, for example, and your doctor can track how you are adjusting to the therapy. The negative is that if you don't meet certain nightly/monthly averages, the insurance company can decide to stop covering you.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Genghis Blues (1999) 

It's about a blind blues singer named Paul Pena who heard Tuvan throat singing while listening to short wave radio, started doing it himself, and was invited by Kongar-ol Ondar, a famous Tuvan throat singer, to travel to Tuva (in Southern Siberia) to participate in a throat singing festival. It's amazing and so is the soundtrack. Here's Kongar-Ol on the Letterman show: [Kongar-Ol](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVyyhHFKI8E) </TEXT>
