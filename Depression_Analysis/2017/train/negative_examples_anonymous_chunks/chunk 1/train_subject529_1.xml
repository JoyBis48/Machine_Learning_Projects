	<TEXT> This question is purely theoretical for the time being; however, I am genuinely extremely curious about this: Is putting sperm directly into a man's bloodstream a guaranteed way to permanently sterilize him? As in, is this type of male sterilization incapable of ever failing for any male?

Any thoughts on this?

Also, Yes, this is certainly a completely serious question. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Do you think that elective orchiectomies (castrations) for sterilization purposes should be available to men in a safe, medical setting? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-06-20 07:28:56 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> OK--here is my question:

Do you think that elective orchiectomies (castrations) for sterilization purposes should be available to men in a safe, medical setting (as opposed to in a "back-alley")?

This question is not an abstract one; rather, this question is a very real and relevant question for me personally considering that I myself want to become a eunuch in large part for sterilization reasons but also, if possible (after all, I still want to get erections using my penis) for feminization purposes and to reduce my sex drive.

Now--why exactly am I asking this? Well, many pro-choicers, both on Reddit and elsewhere, have told me that they are unwilling to deal with *any* risk of an unwanted offspring being born. Thus, I see absolutely *no* reason for me to be okay with *any* risk of this occurring. However, since I myself obviously don't have the option of abortion (and would *never* rely on *any* woman's word that she will get an abortion *regardless* of whatever promises she made to me beforehand) and consider the idea of abstaining from penis-in-vagina sex with *all* fertile and potentially fertile women to be both utterly unrealistic and utterly unacceptable, there is no other acceptable choice for me in regards to achieving this goal other than castration due to the fact that *all* non-drastic contraceptives and sterilizations have a failure rate.

Also, before someone brings up the "Do no harm" principle, I would like to point out that:

1. This principle was already thrown out of the window when doctors performed many/most medically unnecessary elective surgeries.

2. Self-castration attempts and "back-alley" castration attempts are *much* more dangerous than getting castrated (as in, getting an orchiectomy) in a safe, medical setting.

3. There is *no* other way for a man to get himself sterilized in a way which *cannot ever* fail.

4. The worst effects of castration can be mitigated/dealt with the help of hormone replacement therapy.

Also, in regards to lawsuits, let me say this--first of all, as far as I know, there are waivers for doctors to significantly reduce or eliminate this risk. However, even if one ignores that, it is worth noting that, short of a massive botching of my (planned) castration (orchiectomy), I myself would consider it to be extremely immoral to sue a doctor for performing a castration (orchiectomy) on me. After all, if I will even try suing such a compassionate and caring doctor for doing this, then this doctor might become more hesitant to perform elective castrations in the future, which in turn could very well result in more self-castration attempts and in more back-alley castration attempts (both of which are (much) more dangerous) afterwards. Thus, for me, suing such a doctor for doing this is absolutely intolerable!

In addition to this, please don't lecture me about biological differences! After all, I myself have absolutely *no* intention of being a slave to biology! After all, just because biology is unequal and unfair certainly does *not* mean that we cannot and should not make it more equal and fairer.

Thus, again, my question here is this--do you think that elective orchiectomies (castrations) for sterilization purposes should be available to men in a safe, medical setting (as opposed to in a "back-alley")?

	<DATE> 2015-06-15 23:08:00 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Basically, this question is pretty self-explanatory: Other than a massive screw-up on the doctor's part during a surgery, are waivers an extremely effective way for doctors to avoid getting sued by patients who change their minds about their surgeries later on?

What especially got me curious about this is this part of this article:

http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/health/no-sex-please-were-eunuchs-28469767.html

"
Before the operation he had a half-hour consultation with the surgeon about why he wanted to be castrated. At the time I didnt know why I wanted to have it done, Roger admits. I just knew I wanted it. He wanted to make sure that it was the right decision to make. I had to sign a waiver so that I couldnt sue him for any kind of negligence. He gave me all the opportunities to back out of it.
"

Frankly, as far as I know, the doctor mentioned in this article (who I think is now deceased) never got sued by any of his patients for performing elective castrations (which, for the record, I strongly applaud him for doing due to my own egalitarian views on this and due to the fact that it is better than self-castrations and "back-alley" castrations).

Anyway, any thoughts on this? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In your opinion, how much of a role did 9/11 have in Al Gore's decision not to run for U.S. President in 2004? After all, 9/11 and its aftermath helped push the dispute over the 2000 election into the past (which might have helped Bush) and also helped Bush by giving him an anti-terrorism and anti-Axis of Evil platform to use in his 2004 re-election campaign.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I know that this might be a pretty unimportant issue, but what if the 2006 Montenegrin independence referendum narrowly failed rather than narrowly passed (as in real life)? For the record, by "narrowly failed", I mean the pro-independence side winning, say, 54.5% of the vote and thus narrowly missing the 55.0% threshold.

Any thoughts on this? Also, it would be especially nice if someone with some knowledge of Montenegro and/or of the Balkans in general could respond to this question of mine.

	<DATE> 2015-06-01 11:39:17 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> As for me, I am tempted to say that I would have created a very loose Iraqi federation with three extremely autonomous parts--a Sunni one, a Shiite one, and a Kurdish one. All of these parts get a share of the Iraqi oil revenues (based on, say, their population or whatever) as well as the right to secede (in which case they gain full control of the oil on their territory but lose their rights to the revenues from oil in other parts of Iraq). If neighboring countries have a problem with this Iraqi right to secede, then I would tell them to deal with it. Also, I would have had Iraq create a Western-style constitution which would allow democracy and free elections to occur in Iraq. In addition, I most certainly would not have disbanded the entire Iraqi Army in 2003; rather, I would have only purged the "bad apples" (as in, those with a lot of blood on their hands) at the top of this Army.  Also, before I forget, I would have also demanded that Iraq give the U.S. a part of its oil revenues in order to compensate the U.S. for its losses in Iraq.

Frankly, if my approach in regards to this would have been followed, then there might have very well been no Sunni insurgency in the 2000s in Iraq and likewise no ISIS presence in Iraq right now.

	<DATE> 2015-05-29 10:11:28 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I was wondering if anyone here who still has a penis but who already got rid of his or her testicles (for whatever reason) is able to tell me how exactly penis-in-vagina seek feels for him or her right now; specifically, does this sex feel good? As good as it was before?

The reason that I am asking this question is because I myself want to get castrated/have an orchiectomy in order to be sterilized in a way which cannot ever fail (after all, even vasectomies can fail), in order to regulate my sex drive, and in order to help feminize my body to some extent (after all, I am a gender-fluid/cross-dreaming person). However, I would still like to keep my penis indefinitely as well as to have penis-in-vagina sex.

	<DATE> 2015-05-27 22:28:41 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Was the Safavid conversion of Iran to Twelver Shia Islam an early example of a nationalistic move by a government? After all, as far as I know, the goal of this mass conversion was to help create an even more unique Persian/Iranian identity which would help Iran (then known as Persia) preserve its independence in the face of threats from the Ottoman Empire. Plus, this move made Iran an "island" of Shiism surrounded by a sea of Sunnism.

Frankly, to me, if one replaces the religious aspect with the ethnic aspect, this Safavid policy appears to be very similar to some of the policies of European nationalists in the 19th century and beyond; after all, as far as I know, some/many European nationalists in the 19th century and beyond (such as those in France) pursued policies such as teaching everyone the same dialect of their official national language in order to create and foster a greater sense of national unity and cohesiveness in their countries.

	<TITLE> What if Saddam Hussein invades Syria instead of Kuwait? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-05-19 11:26:05 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> This might be extremely unlikely, but here goes:

What if the U.S. had given Saddam Hussein a crystal-clear and stern warning that the U.S. will intervene if he will invade Kuwait and Saddam Hussein thus decided to invade Syria instead due to the fact that, while Syria doesn't have much oil, conquering Sunni-majority Syria might allow Saddam and his Sunni supporters to further consolidate their power in Iraq. Plus, Saddam might come to believe that a rematch between Iraq and Iran is inevitable; thus, he would like to pursue regime change in Syria in order to overthrow the Iranian-allied Assad regime there and in order to eliminate the possibility of a two-front war (for Iraq--after all, Iran is on the eastern side of Iraq while Syria is on the western side of Iraq) in the future.

How exactly will an Iraqi invasion of Syria in the early 1990s (say, sometime between 1990 and 1995) turn out? Also, would there have been a significant difference in the outcome of this war if this Iraqi invasion of Syria would have occurred before as opposed to after the collapse of the Soviet Union?

	<TITLE> Funny Joke About Being Ripped Off </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-05-18 23:48:49 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> This joke is in the form of a story; anyway:

-Bob goes to Mary and Richard's house (for the record, Mary and Richard are boyfriend and girlfriend).

-Mary opens the door wearing nothing but a towel.

-Bob tells Mary: "I'll give you $500 if you will show me what exactly is covered by your towel!"

-Mary thinks about this and then temporarily removes her towel, thus showing Bob her naked body.

-Bob then gives Mary the $500, and Mary closes the door afterwards. Afterwards, Bob goes back to his house.

-With the $500 in her hands, Mary goes upstairs, where Richard currently is.

-Richard asks Mary: "Who exactly was at the door?"

-Mary replies: "Oh, it was just our creepy neighbor Bob."

-In response, Richard asks: "Did Bob ever tell you anything about the $500 that he owes me?"

	<TITLE> When exactly, if ever, do you think that we will be able to successfully change people's gender identity? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-05-18 10:06:20 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> OK--basically I myself am a gender-fluid person who identifies more as male than as female; however, the idea of feeling female extremely strongly appeals to me. While I am capable of sometimes living as a (trans-)woman, I suspect that it would be very hard for me to do this all of the time; however, the idea of living as a (trans-)woman full-time would extremely strongly appeal to me if there was much less transphobia than there currently is. (For the record, I do strongly want to feminize my body, but I would still prefer to live as a male most (but certainly not all) of the time unless (God forbid) "my hand is forced" in regards to this.)

Thus, my question here is this--when exactly, if ever, do you think that we will be able to successfully change people's gender identity (on a completely voluntary basis, obviously)?

Also, to clarify--I myself certainly don't care whether or not other people would utilize such technology if it is ever developed; rather, my primary interest in such technology is personal.

	<TEXT> As you hopefully know, when Britain withdrew from Palestine in 1948, Palestine was (supposed to be) partitioned between the Jews and the Arabs. Likewise, when Britain withdrew from India in 1947, India was partitioned between the Hindus and the Muslims so that each of these religious groups would have a state which they would solidly dominate (of course, the Muslims in British India appear to have wanted this much more (and for obvious reasons) than the Hindus in British India did).

Anyway, what I am asking here is if there could have been any other realistic cases where European powers partitioned their colonies into two or more separate countries (in order to create separate countries for various ethnic and/or religious groups) before they (the Europeans) withdrew from these colonies and gave these colonies independence. If so, then exactly which other former European colonies could have been partitioned in this way shortly before they acquired independence?

	<DATE> 2015-05-11 05:51:45 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> In regards to this contraceptive testosterone gel:

http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/03/block-that-sperm/384971/

"A testosterone gel: The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development is nearing a second round of clinical trials of a hormonal gel that men are directed to rub daily on their shoulders (a place thats not too hairy and not too sweaty, the NICHDs Diana Blithe told me). The gel contains Nestorone, a synthetic progestin that, by inhibiting testosterone production, stops the testicles from making sperm. The drug would also deliver testosterone to the blood, in an effort to prevent any change in libido, ejaculation, or muscle mass. Blithe says she hopes the gel will make for an appealing alternative to vasectomies and condoms."

I've got a question--other than the fact that it is presumably temporary and presumably capable of failure, how exactly, if at all, is this contraceptive testosterone gel *meaningfully* different from physical/surgical castration plus testosterone replacement therapy? Maybe I am totally missing something here, but the only *meaningful* differences between these two things which I see are the fact that this gel is presumably reversible and the fact that this gel is presumably capable of failure.

Any thoughts on this? Is my analysis of this spot-on, or am I completely missing something here?

Also, Yes, this is certainly a completely serious question. :) Also, I am certainly *not* trying to provoke anyone here; rather, I am simply trying to learn more information myself. :) </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Al Gore Wins in 2000; What Exactly Does U.S. Foreign Policy Look Like From 2001 to the Present-Day? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-05-11 05:32:48 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Let's have Al Gore officially win in 2000 by winning Florida by several hundred or several thousand votes as a result of George W. Bush saying a(n additional) stupid remark shortly before the 2000 election.

In this scenario, what exactly does U.S. foreign policy look like from 2001 to the present-day?

As for my own thoughts on this, here you go:

Al Gore (U.S. President between 2001 and 2009):

-9/11 still occurs due to the fact that, as far as I know, at least some of the issues (such as various U.S. intelligence agencies failing to sufficiently work with each other) which failed to prevent 9/11 would have still existed in this scenario.

-After 9/11, Gore would have still invaded Afghanistan due to the Taliban refusing to accept all of the conditions in his post-9/11 ultimatum to them. After helping the Northern Alliance overthrow the Taliban, the U.S. would have successfully killed Osama Bin Laden. However, after Bin Laden's death, Al-Qaeda would still continue to exist and to function with new leadership (but would gradually become weakened over time). Hamid Karzai is still installed as the new President of Afghanistan in this scenario, and while there is much more of a U.S. and Western focus on Afghanistan in this scenario, a lot of the issues which affected the Western war effort in Afghanistan in real life would have still been present in this scenario. Thus, I suspect that the U.S. will eventually lose its patience in Afghanistan in this scenario (and earlier than in real life) and thus eventually push for the creation of a Northern Alliance-"reformed" Taliban unity government in Afghanistan with a small long-lasting Western troop presence in Afghanistan in order to help keep the peace there. Whether the U.S. and the West (as in, the other NATO countries) will succeed in regards to doing this is anybody's guess.

-Gore does *not* invade Iraq due to the fact that he does *not* have a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein like Bush Jr. did. Rather, Gore exploits the aftermath of 9/11 to fully restore the sanctions regime on Iraq and to keep a close eye on Saddam Hussein.

-Gore successfully pursues a rapprochement with Iran due to their mutual hostility to the Taliban, al-Qaeda, and Saddam Hussein. Gore views a U.S. rapprochement with Iran as a useful tool to help stabilize Afghanistan and to put additional pressure on Saddam Hussein.

-Without an Iraq War, Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi takes longer to pursue a rapprochement with the West. However, 9/11 helps gradually push Gaddafi and the West closer together, which in turn results in Gaddafi fully renouncing terrorism and giving up all of his WMDs and his nuclear weapons program sometime in Gore's second term (2005-2009).

-There are more U.S.-Israel tensions in the early 2000s than there was in real life due to the fact that Gore, unlike Bush, doesn't fully support *all* of the anti-terrorism actions which Israel conducts during the Second Intifada. After Arafat's death and the second of the Second Intifada, however, U.S. and Israeli relations become warmer and Gore unsuccessfully makes a push for Israeli-Palestinian peace which fails due to Ehud Olmert's 2008 or 2009 resignation as a result of corruption allegations against him.

-Gore *might* militarily intervene in order to stop the genocide in Darfur, perhaps with the help of NATO; however, I am certainly *not* completely sure about this.

-North Korea probably does *not* build a nuclear weapon as early as it did in real life due to the fact that Gore, unlike Bush, would probably *not* be unequivocally hostile to North Korea.

-Without the Iraq War, U.S. relations with Europe would be better and warmer than they were under the Bush Administration in real life.

Some Republican (maybe someone such as George Allen; U.S. President between 2009 and 2017):

-Once the Arab Spring occurs, the U.S. and NATO still overthrow Muammar Gaddafi's regime in Libya. Likewise, NATO (including the U.S.) and Iran launch a joint large-scale military operation/campaign to overthrow Saddam Hussein during the Arab Spring due to the fact that the Arab Spring provides a good opportunity to do this. Afterwards, Iraq either gets partitioned into two or three separate countries or becomes a semi-functioning Shiite-led democracy which gives large autonomy to its various ethnic groups and regions. However, the process of stabilizing Iraq after the overthrow of Saddam Hussein could take a while, just like it did in real life.

-Likewise, the U.S. provides a large amount of assistance (including lethal military aid) to both opponents of Assad's regime in Syria and to the Ukrainian government (who are fighting against Russian-supported rebels in Eastern Ukraine). In turn, this results in Assad eventually getting overthrown in Syria and to a more difficult fight for Russia in Ukraine but one which Russia nevertheless still manages to eventually "win".

-The U.S. is no more successful at making peace between Israel and the Palestinians between 2009 and 2017 in this scenario than it was either under Bill Clinton or under Al Gore.

-North Korea withdraws from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and successfully builds and tests nuclear weapons sometime between 2009 and 2017.

Anyway, what exactly am I forgetting to list/state here?

Also, does anyone have any thoughts in regards to any of this? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> OK--basically, I (the OP here) am a 22-year-old gender-fluid/cross-dreaming male who would like to get castrated (Yes, castrated, as in getting my testicles removed) and is willing to do whatever it takes in order to get this done.

Now, why exactly do I want to get castrated? Well, first of all, I would like to get sterilized in a way which cannot ever fail (after all of the remaining sperm in my body already die off, that is). Vasectomies can fail, all other available contraceptives can fail, and as for Vasalgel, it is way too untested for me. Plus, I have never heard anyone give me an extremely good reason as for why exactly Vasalgel is incapable of ever failing. The fact that Vasalgel hasn't failed yet doesn't necessarily mean that it will never fail for anyone; after all, I would think that vasectomies likewise had a 100% effectiveness rate before the first historical vasectomy failure actually occurred.

Also, before anyone brings up the idea of me only having sex with women who share my own views in regards to pregnancy, I would like to point out that I would never rely on any woman's word that she will get an abortion (or give our hypothetical future offspring for adoption, for that matter); after all, a woman can simply change her mind on this later on.

Also, abstaining from vaginal sex with all fertile and potentially fertile women for the rest of my life is likewise both completely unrealistic and completely unacceptable for me.

Thus, I have to take matters into my own hands and seek out castration (Yes, castration, as in the removal of both of my testicles) by any means necessary. Afterwards, I will need to utilize hormone replacement therapy in order to deal with the less pleasant effects of castration.

Also, I would like to point out that I would like to regulate my sex drive and that, as a gender-fluid/cross-dreaming person, I might very well want to take female hormones after my planned castration if I am still (somehow) able to indefinitely get erections (using my penis, which I intend to keep indefinitely) afterwards. I mean, the idea of me becoming a six-foot-tall beauty strongly appeals to me, and not in a sexual way. Indeed, whenever I shave my face, I am always reminded of just how incredibly beautiful of a (trans-)woman I would make. :) However, at the same time, just to be safe, I want to keep all of my options open in regards to which hormone replacement therapy I should take after my planned castration (Yes, castration).

Anyway, what I am wondering is if anyone who is either a eunuch or a trans-woman can give me my advice in regards to utilizing hormone replacement therapy (either kind) and in regards to living a life without gonads in general. In addition, I would also like to hear about the sex lives of eunuchs, specifically in regards to erections, orgasm, et cetera, since this information is certainly of personal interest to me. Also, if anyone has any additional information which I might be interested in, then please don't hesitate to share this information with me!

Also, one more question--exactly how long will I need to wait after castration in order to be completely sure that all of the remaining sperm in my body are already dead?

And Yes, if anyone has any doubts in regards to this, this is certainly a completely serious post. </TEXT>

(Love of My Life - The Wedding Song by Darla Day)

Personally, as someone who is a Pastafarian on my good days and an agnostic on my bad days, I strongly like this wedding song despite its religious tones. After all, it just sounds so beautiful and wonderful! :)

Also, while I myself am too young to get married, say, within the next decade, I might decide to use this wedding song when I will eventually get married (if my future wife will be okay with it, that is). After all, the references to "God" in this song can certainly be interpreted as references to the Pastafarian God. ;)
