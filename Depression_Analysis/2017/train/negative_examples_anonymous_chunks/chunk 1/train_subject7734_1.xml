	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Over this past weekend I uploaded a [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJ4J-c1We-s) of my friends' dog dancing to The Miami Sound Machine. First as a [comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/13ndm0/my_dog_has_a_meltdown_when_i_give_her_a_beggin/c75jfpa) and then as it's own [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/13nlmy/my_friends_dog_decided_to_dance_today_for_some/). I posted it at night and woke up to it playing on The Today Show. My friend told me that after looking through the statistics it had most definitely gotten it's original traffic through reddit.


* Do you get paid to sift through sites or is it an added on job to what you already do?

* Do the hosts understand Reddit?

* Are you an active member or just a lurker?

* Can you get me a job doing this? I know how to spend too much time on Reddit.

* Can you get one of the hosts to wear a reddit alien on the air?
