	<TEXT> All they care about, in the end, is the war itself -- or rather, war itself. Wherever they find incipient conflict, they are eager to exacerbate it, sustain it -- and feed upon it...Almost invariably, the policies adopted by the imperial managers (of both parties) make the conflicts worse, fomenting extremist resistance and ever-more violent repression: a deadly cycle that benefits no one -- except the "masters of war." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In another event that calls into serious question the Pentagons unfailingly positive view of US progress in Afghanistan, the US military was compelled to acknowledge that it had significantly underestimated the seriousness of an incident that took place Wednesday, when a man drove a truck onto the runway at the Camp Bastion airport in Helmand, just as the plane bringing Defense Secretary Panetta was arriving there.
 
**It has since emerged that the individual driving the truck, which had been stolen from an Afghan soldier, was an Afghan interpreter working for the US-led occupation**. He died on Thursday from severe burns suffered when he apparently tried to ignite the vehicle. **Pentagon officials admitted Thursday that the interpreter was trying to run down a group of US Marines assigned to meet the aircraft.**
 
The incident underscored both the lack of security in an area supposedly secured by the US surge, as well as the continuing proliferation of so-called green-on-blue violence, the term used by the US military to describe attacks against it by Afghan security forces that are supposedly its allies. </TEXT>

The two American officers who were killed were shot in the head and the pistol used to kill them was **equipped with a silencer**, the officials said.

Afghan officials said that Mr. Saboor was at large, apparently **able to leave the ministry without complication after the shooting**. That suggested to some observers that he may have had help in the attack. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Unlike a vast majority of those running for office, [Santorum] is totally OK with going there, penis-in-various-holes-wise. I suspect that it's his apparent comfort with explicitly raising the idea of sex, as much as his out-of-kilter views on it, that rankles all but the most extreme social conservatives. To go from the hypothetical legalization of homosexual marriage to bestiality, you have to have at least given passing thought to the physical act of gay sex.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> From the comments section: The analysis of Mr. Mallon is good, except in regards to his comments on Ron Paul's foreign policy. Endless war and the gold standard don't get along very well. There is no way that this country can ever return to fiscal solvency as long as we have the oversears empire. For 100 years the USA has tried to be the policeman of the world. The Federal Reserve and our endless over seas entanglements started with Woodrow Wilson. It is time to drive a stake through the heart of Wilsonianism. End the Fed. Bring the troops home. Concentrate on this country and let the world run itself. Wars always lead to high inflation and high taxes. Greenspan and Bernanke though that they could get us through these wars without either. Well we see how that turned out. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Here is the money quote from Chuck Todd: Look, this is a game of where does Mitt Romey finish and where does Newt Gingrich, or maybe even an upset, a Rick Perry finish.  If any of those guys finish above Mitt Romney that are not named Ron Paul, that person will be, the quote, the winner out of here regardless of whether Ron Paul is the actual winner.

I hope somebody does a video w/ all of these statements about the caucuses essentially being meaningless if RP wins.  That could be very inspirational on the day before the voting. </TEXT>
