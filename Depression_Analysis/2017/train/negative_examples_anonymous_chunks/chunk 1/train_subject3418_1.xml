	<TEXT> If you really want a challenge, I read about a no-junction challenge on gamefaqs that seems pretty damn crazy...

...but if you want to use all the game mechanics, maybe just limit which magics you use to junction. Like maybe only junction the basic level (fire, thunder) and avoid all the third-level (thundaga, etc.). Also stay away from triple and ultima and other crazy-powerful spells. </TEXT>

I'd say 8 has a higher learning curve on figuring out how the junction system works, but I thought the story was better. 9 is more old-school in gameplay and probably easier to pick up from the get-go. </TEXT>

I think the battle system had potential but the story and gameplay just weren't there for me. </TEXT>

Reading/learning- Library card for books, and I also go to Project Gutenberg to get free ebooks for my phone.  </TEXT>
