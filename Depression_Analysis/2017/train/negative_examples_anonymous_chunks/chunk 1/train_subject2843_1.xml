	<TEXT> Hey there! I actually designed the whole thing on graph paper and made a paper version of it before I started. I used the paper as templates for the design and cut the scrap leather. I used a stitching awl for all of the white stitches. The lace work was done with suede strapping and a leather hole punch. I measured off all the holes I made. When I attached the bottom I used a super heavy weight leather and a softer leather over it. I had one side of the stitches done up the tube part and I flipped it inside out when I finished the stitches on the bottom. I added the border of leather on the top and the split ring on the side with a rivet. It took several hours to complete.  </TEXT>
