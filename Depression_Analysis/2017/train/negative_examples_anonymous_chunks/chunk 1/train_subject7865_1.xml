To return to the intellectual side of this, yes I know the sun does it, but I was referring to human-made technology. It's never been achieved by humans, and given that we can't just recreate the sun there is no way yet to be certain it will definitely be achieved, particularly if it gets superseded by another technology that is cheaper to create.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have had the same experience, but I don't think it's on the same scale. So many people stuck with XP that they never got to 7 to then respond that way to it. 
I think a bigger part of it is that XP is what was out when many people finally got on board with the idea of computers - that OS is literally all they've known and all they are prepared to cope with.

	<TEXT> I think getting more people online could have a really interesting effect on both the world and the internet. The internet does give you the tools to do an amazing amount - it really does make starting a business easier, so I could see it really benefiting people currently in poverty.

But it will be interesting to see what the impact will be on the internet - will the next mega internet company come from India? Will we see an increase in memes that derived from the pop culture of developing countries? Or will variation in internet speeds lead to region-specific ghettos online? </TEXT>
