2 and 3 were pretty terrible. But I loved 1 so much and stll play it today, and one of the best aspects was the awesome campy 50s setting and atmosphere. But 3 had a really cool next gen physics engine and way more advanced TK and flying saucer abilities. Plus more destructibility.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's the one thing I didn't like about it. Otherwise it was a really fantastic fun action movie. But once it started going down *that* path in the third act it felt a little off. It kinda cheapened what was supposed to be the most emotional and important part of the movie. Also I thought the cameo towards the end was dumb.

But pretty much if you liked the first you'll like this. Fun and cool and fast paced and funny and with a surprisingly interesting and unpredictable story. A little bit darker and more serious, but nothing drastic. Maybe not quite as good as the first one, but its definitely worth seeing. I really really liked it. </TEXT>

I am excited as hell. Shaun and Fuzz are two of my all time favorite movies and I never get sick of watching them over and over again. Edgar, Simon and Nick know how to pull off some of the most fun and fast paced, and yet incredibly intelligent and well crafted comedies you're gonna find today.

Honestly, in my opinion, this trilogy might even be revered years from now along with other brilliant cult comedies like Big Lebowsky, Airplane and Dr Strangelove.

EDIT: I hope Bill Nighy has a cameo </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I figure most people here have played the game with all the crazy posts about it recently, so I thought this would get an answer. I haven't bought it yet but I'm sure I'll get around to it eventually.

So I was wondering, what happens if you use Doomsday or Superman or Flash's super move while on the Watchtower map? The animation for those three supers definitely can only take place on the earth. Even Hawkgirl, Captain Marvel and Black Adam's super moves deal with the characters being below the clouds. Do the characters just magically teleport down to earth for the super move and then magically teleport back to the Watchtower to continue the fight? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So it seems that the Injustice: Gods Among Us roster is as follows:

Ares

Aquaman

Bane

Batman

Black Adam

Catwoman

Cyborg

Deathstroke

Doomsday

Flash

Green Arrow

Green Lantern

Harley Quinn

Hawkgirl

Joker

Killer Frost

Lex Luthor

Nightwing

Raven

Shazam

Sinestro

Solomon Grundy

Superman

Wonder Woman

That's 24 in total, and it appears there will be another 4 characters available as DLC with the season pass, which brings us to 28 characters. So if you could pick any 28 characters to be in Injustice, who would you have gone with?

	<TITLE> My five director choices for Bond 24 </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-03-10 11:54:42 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Since there's still no confirmed director for the next Bond film, I thought it might be fun if we just discussed who we'd like to see take over from Mendes.
Here are my top five choices, plus I think they're all fairly realistic.

1 - Martin Campbell

Directed two of the best bonds (in my opinion) and while it might be a safe or boring choice to bring him back, we'd be assured a great film. Plus his non-Bond films always end up being disasters anyway, so he might as well stick with subject matter he can pull off.

2 - Edward Zwick

Last Samurai, Blood Diamond, Defiance (with Daniel Craig) He just seems like exactly the kind of director who could make a great Bond film.

3 - Guy Ritchie

A lot of rumours are floating around about him taking over, and while it seems like a strange choice to me, the Sherlock Holmes filmed certainly showed that he's capable.

4 - Joe Wright

Another name that I've heard being mentioned a lot. I actually haven't seen anything of his besides Hannah, but I've heard good things.

5 - Matthew Vaughn

I'm not the biggest Vaughn fan in the world, but Layer Cake (with Daniel Craig) was pretty great, and the first half of Xmen First Class with all the Magneto revenge stuff is brilliant, and convinces me that he could potentially nail Bond.

EDIT

Bonus Director suggestion - David Yates

I wasn't super into Harry Potter, but the last couple movies looked incredible, and had some really impressive action sequences and some really cool and interesting directorial choices.

So what do you guys think? 

Who would you like to see take over Bond 24 and why?

(Other choices that would be too weird or unrealistic or unlikely, just for fun, would be David Fincher, Tomas Alfredson, Kenneth Branagh, Pierre Morel, Chan Wook Park, Niels Arden Oplev, Luc Besson, and of course, Christopher Nolan) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BC_(video_game)

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POZEB-H_k_0

http://au.gamespot.com/bc/

BC was a video game under development by Lionhead Studios, but it was cancelled in 2004. I remember being so so incredibly excited for it as a kid, and I still haven't really gotten over it. It was going to be super huge and elaborate, super violent, really intelligent, but mostly really fun and over the top and a bit goofy.

Basically it was an open world RPG/action adventure game where you take control of a tribe of cavemen and have to fight dinosaurs, killer apes, sabretooth tigers, and other prehistoric monsters to ensure the survival and evolution of your species. Upgrade your caveman, craft new weapons and potions, learn magic, expand your campsite, manage your tribe, hunt for food or survival or fun.

Also dinosaurs, you guys. More games need dinosaurs.

Just imagining a game of this scale and awesomeness on the next generation of consoles and PCs makes me think they really need to get this project going again. No other game is like this, it's a totally new and original and exciting crazy fun sounding idea.
At best I can guess it'd be like a prehistoric Skyrim meets Turok meets FarCry 3, only campy and silly and super violent with dinosaurs and monsters, and most importantly, bright colours and a fun cartoony art design, like games used to be before they got all super serious and big budget.

I would donate half the organs in my body to bring this game back. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Got my little sister into reading more 'mature' books, and now we've bonded much closer and she's super excited about learning about new books and authors! </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> My sister is 14, and she's always been very smart and good at reading. She's read the typical teenage girl stuff, but nothing really outside what everyone else her age is reading, and she never read very often. But recently when the Hunger Games movie came out, I mentioned that it was very similar to Battle Royale.

She seemed really interested so I got out my copy and borrowed it to her. She read it super quick and seemed to really love it. So I gave her Enders Game, and she loved that too. So I started giving her some of my favourite books, and told her she can read anything on my bookshelf. (as long as she asks first)

Now she doesn't want to read the normal stuff her friends read or her teachers reccommend her, now she wants the next book by Vonnegut or Gaiman or Twain. She even came home from school one day and said her English teacher mentioned that they'd be reading Animal Farm the next year, and that the teacher was super impressed that she had already read through Animal Farm and 1984 several times. 

Now we can talk about awesome literature and we have even more in common. I feel like we've bonded closer as friends now and we always have something interesting to talk about. This is the first time I've gotten anyone into reading and I guess I'm just super proud. Thought I'd share. :)  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Strange similarities between Pan's Labyrinth and The Shining. (Spoilers for both) </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2012-12-11 04:45:00 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I've watched both these movies recently, for the thousandth time, and I just realized some weird similarities between the plots and events of both movies, and I was wondering if anyone else noticed this or maybe knew if it was intentional or anything.

Not only do the plots of both films involve a dysfunctional (to say the least) family being forced to live together in a remote building for extended periods of time with little contact with the outside world, but both films also have a climax at the end where the child in said dysfunctional family is chased through a maze by their murderous father.

Not only that, but both films remain relatively ambiguous as to whether or not the supernatural elements of the story are actually occurring, or are just the result of the main character's deteriorating mental state, with the exception of a scene in both films at the start of the final act where the supernatural beings help the main character escape from an otherwise inescapable imprisonment. (Jack is freed from the pantry by Grady, Ofelia is freed from her bedroom by the Faun)

So what do you guys think? Coincidence? Intentional parallel? Bit of a reach? Do you guys know of any other films with oddly similar elements? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Is anyone else not really enjoying Rotworld (New 52 Animal Man and Swamp Thing crossover) </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2012-12-11 02:23:19 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> When the New 52 started, Animal Man and Swamp thing were my favorite titles. They were so unique and weird and dark and well written and funny and fucked up. Both their first arcs were absolutely incredible and they quickly became my favorite current comics. Snyder and Lemire are definitely among the best writers working in comics today, and I have no problem at all with long story arcs. But then the lead up to Rotworld started and both titles seemed to just be spinning their wheels. Especially Animal Man. I love both characters, and I love the Rot, and the characters were great on their own in the normal world, but it hasn't been grabbing me like it used to. And now that Rotworld is underway I'm not really into it at all. Plus now Snyder is leaving Swamp Thing so I'm even less enthused. I really hope Lemire and whoever takes over after Snyder have some awesome unique stand alone stories because this whole crossover event has felt really drawn out and disappointing to me. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I watched the movie on tv while cooking dinner, so I feel like I maybe missed something. I absolutely loved the movie, and I thought the shot of Kong riding the nuke down would have been a perfect final shot before the nuclear explosion montage. But what was the point of the final scene where Strangelove freaks out and stands up? I totally got and loved the conversation they were having about basically restarting the arms race in a hundred years after the apocalypse, very funny and poignant, but what was happening to Strangelove? What was the Russian guy doing with that clock thing? Why end the movie there on that final line? What does it mean? Or is it just a funny line to go out on with no significance? I feel like I missed something and probably need to watch it again. 
Also I wish that alternate pie fight ending was kept. That sounds brilliant. </TEXT>

I bought a 6 inch Dark Knight Batman but it looks too small and silly next to the others. Does anyone know where I can get a good quality 6.75 inch figurine? </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2012-08-13 15:40:08 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm looking for a cool book about aliens or an alien invasion or some sort of sci fi paranoia thriller type stuff.

I'm really sick of alien invasions and apocalyptic scenarios and anything big like that. The first acts of alien stories are always my favourite. Where it's just mysterious sightings and media hysteria and paranoia and suspense and all that jazz.

If anyone knows of some more slow-burning alien sci-fi books, that are less about alien invasions and more about the mystery and conspiracies and suspense, and most importantly, if you know of any books that can really give you something to think about, I'd love to hear about them!

Thanks, guys </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Grant Morrison and Barry Sonnenfeld have been hyping this thing up like crazy, and it looks like a nice fun bit of insanity, so I picked it up today.

Did anyone else know that this was not at all a complete story? I paid 20 bucks for this graphic novel, and it's 3 or 4 chapters, basically an introductory first act, and the Dinosaurs and Aliens don't even fight.
The book was actually pretty cool. Nothing special, but a lot better than the silly premise would make it seem. I was actually really getting into it and enjoying where the story seemed to be going, and I was looking forward to exploring the crazy Dinosaur culture as well as the complex 'villain' aliens. But then it just suddenly ends before anything happens.  

I'm assuming there must be more books coming, but for 20 bucks I was really expecting that I'd actually get the full story, not just the first act. Especially since that it didn't say Part 1 or anything on it and it wasn't advertised as being an incomplete novel. I can't find anything about when, or even if there's more coming.

Maybe I missed something or I'm just dumb. </TEXT>

Animal Man is probably my favorite book in the new 52, and one of the best books currently on the stands, and a part of what makes it great is the super surreal fucked up art by Travel Foreman.
But the last couple issues it seems that the art has changed every couple of pages, as if another artist is taking over at random points. What is the significance of this? </TEXT>

But if Animal Man and Superman were in a fight for some reason, could Animal Man simply adopt Superman's powers to fight him? He can adopt the powers of pretty much any creature alive or dead, and I remember he even adopted Bwana Beast's powers that one time. Couldn't he just start taking powers from Superman and Flash and Captain Marvel and Aquaman and other heroes instead of just animals?

An IPad is way out of my price range, but I was thinking a Nook or a Pandigital Novel would be a good choice. Do I have to download a DC app to download comics or is there a website I should use? What about other more obscure comics from other brands? Can I subscribe to titles I like? I've never bought eBooks or used a tablet so I have no idea how they work.

They both sound sorta similar. 

[Gotham Noir](http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Batman:_Gotham_Noir) stars Gordon as an alcoholic detective and was written by Ed Brubaker, and [Nine Lives](http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Batman:_Nine_Lives) stars Dick Grayson as a PI and was featured on IGN's list of the best Batman graphic novels.

As much bigger Batman fans than myself, what other great trade paperbacks/graphic novels do you guys recommend I check out?
If you could give me a little info on the titles you think I should read so I know what they're like that'd be fantastic.

	<TEXT> Hey Reddit.
I'm kinda new here. I haven't made a whole lot of posts or anything on Reddit before, I've just been browsing and enjoying the website for a little while, so I don't really know how these things work, but I thought maybe you guys could help me out with something.

My friend sent me a message today saying that her aerobics coach has been diagnosed with cancer and is bedridden and refusing to let people come see her. So my friend has decided to start sending her funny YouTube videos to cheer her up, and was wondering if I could help. I've sent a few, but I thought you guys would have tonnes of hilarious videos up your sleeves. So if you guys could maybe post the funniest YouTube videos you know of, I could link my friend to this post and she'd have tonnes of videos to send to her coach.

I have no idea what exactly this person finds funny or what kind of videos she likes or anything, nor do I know what kind of cancer she has, but I can fill you guys in once my friend replies to me. In the meanwhile, if you guys could just post me some funny videos I'd bee incredibly grateful.

Thanks! </TEXT>
