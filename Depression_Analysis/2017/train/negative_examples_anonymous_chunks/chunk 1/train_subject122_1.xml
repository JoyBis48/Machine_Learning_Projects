	<TEXT> He could be a good veep choice. I just can't see Bush, Romney, and Christie all running, though. Maybe two, but not three. Bush is going to suck the fundraising away from those other two. And this may keep others, like Scott Walker, out of it, though they could bootstrap for awhile.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The Bush-style country club Republican has been on the run these past few years. By the looks of the people Jeb is hiring, he'd bring them back. Whatever innovative mindset he's claimed on education, immigration, etc., the Karl Rove sect is firmly in control of this campaign.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> These lists are tough, since we all have our own opinions and few of us every had a chance to watch the historical greats from different eras, such as Babe Ruth. Those are all HOF-caliber players, for sure, and it's a solid list. Interesting that they only chose 23 pitchers (that's my rough count)--far more position players. Rickey Henderson would make my Top 10. Best player I ever saw.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's interesting and I like it. But in tracking only one election (if I understand correctly), that vastly discounts the fact that one of the candidates could have been a better public speaker, more charismatic, or with speeches written to hit certain popular lines. And meanwhile, the opposing candidate might be better at raising money and running TV ads, so could in the end be just as competitive. With only one campaign, there was a 50% chance of this outcome, which makes for a questionable correlation.  </TEXT>
