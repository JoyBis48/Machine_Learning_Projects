	<TEXT>  Can I just ship something to my neighbor and hand him a bill for it

Of course not.  Your neighbor did not order anything from you.  You engaged in business with this third party and through a series of misunderstandings got a free product.  You do not get to keep free products under those circumstances.  That is the law.

Where you read that you do not need to pay for it or send it back, those are *unordered* merchandise.  Like you sending something completely unsolicited to your neighbor.  This is not that situation. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Obviously he can not afford a lawyer, as he is living in his car, and our public defenders here are notoriously guilty plea factories. Are there any organizations that offer help in these kinds of situations?

Public defenders are no better or worse than paid attorneys.  Public defenders tend to plea out many cases because many of their clients are dead to rights guilty and there is only so much they can do.  If the stop and search was legitimate, it doesn't matter how much you pay for an attorney, your brother is almost certain to be found guilty.  In that circumstance pleading it out would likely get him a better deal.  Not every criminal case benefits from going to trial.

If this is his first offense he's unlikely to get the maximum penalty.

You'd need to find a friend or family member that can take the dog. </TEXT>

Court ordered child arrangements are *orders* not suggestions that you can change as you wish.

	<TEXT> A female and I (6'1" male) get in a heated argument over some topic. In a fit of rage, she swings and sucker punches me as hard as she can. In angry retaliation, I strike her back as hard as I can. Due our size difference, I get off with only a chipped tooth/swollen mouth, while she is left with a serious concussion/possible permanent brain injury. How screwed would I be? Would there be significant changes if our injuries were similar, if I swung first, if the other person was male, or if the person they initially sucker punched wasn't me, but rather a friend?

Not nearly enough information to say.

 I am carrying an expensive ring and drop it on the ground. As I go to pick it up, someone else quickly scoops it up and begins running away. For all intents and purposes assume there is beyond a doubt no way an officer would make it in time before the thief got away, and no way the thief could be tracked/caught. Believing that the ring would be lost for good otherwise, I sprint after them and tackle them to the ground. In order to escape, they attack me in what is arguably self defense. In the struggle to prevent them from escaping, I injure them in some way (ex: break their arm). Would I be screwed in this case? What if instead of stealing the item, it was some unique heirloom they were threatening to break, so that if I didn't interfere in that moment it would beyond a doubt be destroyed?

You could face repercussions but they are unlikely.  You are not Batman and should call the police if such an issue arises.

Some co-worker keeps eating my lunch I leave in the fridge, but no one fesses up when I ask around. I make it clear, I leave a note by the food, belongs to Noobsauce, please do not take! Eventually I lose my cool and hatch an evil plot- I load my next lunch with a bunch of laxative. Am I technically breaking the law here? What if the person had a serious medical reaction to what I put into the food, whether it be some unintended extreme (allergic to something), something in the middle (x10 the recommended dose of laxatives), or something terrible (I go crazy and add cyanide to my lunch)?

We get this question all the time.  No, this is not legal. </TEXT>
