Havre de Grace, Maryland, U.S.A


I posted the above link a few days ago, with the hopes of finding someone to help ease the situation me and my family are in. But today I got some bad news, and its made my situation more dire. My brother has to pay in on his taxes, due to some sort of penalty for not having health insurance last year, and its pushing us to the breaking point.

The special circumstances I mentioned in my title are that I wouldn't be able to repay the loan anytime soon. I'm looking for someone who can understand the situation I'm in and have enough faith in me to trust that I will repay. Even though it may be over a year before I can. I know this goes against the "short term" rules of the sub, but I'm desperate and I'm hoping against hope that you all can take pity for our situation and look the other way.

As far as interest goes, I'm not sure how to go about deciding it. Its something we can discuss if you decide you might be able to help.

I'm not sure on payment methods either. I have a Gofundme account set up, but if their is a quicker method for receiving the payment I'd very much like to use it. The sooner I can get this money to my family, the sooner things will look up for us.

I'm at rock bottom here, and its killing me. Please, if you've ever been in a similar situation and have the means to help me. I'm begging you.

$600

Edit: Someone told me I need a Paypal account to receive help from this sub. I tried creating an account but was unable to because I don't have a debit or credit card. Please, if their are other ways to make this transaction possible, consider them. I can't begin to express how horrifying this whole situation is. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't. I think its terrible that you could believe she "helped" him. He may have been bogged down by personal demons, may have suffered from mental disorders. But were living in a time in history when we finally have some tools to help alleviate those problems.

To think she encouraged him to die, than flips everything and uses his death as a means to make herself look good through charity work is beyond low. That she can talk about how tough life is and how helping others alleviates that pain, when she convinced a man to kill himself. To inhale those noxious fucking chemicals until his heart stopped, is beyond me. How exactly do you think his family feels? I'd bet money they didn't know he was suffering, that he was unhappy. Family is usually the last to know in a situation like this, because the person in question has become so adept at hiding their feelings, and doesn't want them burdened.

I wish you could tell his family your view in person and see first-hand what their going through. What kind of goddamn hell it is to lose someone because they took their own life. To play the last moments you had with them over and over, to wonder while you lay awake if you could've done something. To wish they had reached out to you, because in your heart you know you'd do anything for them.

This has nothing to do with bandwagon mentality, this has to do with people being held responsible for their actions. He wasn't in a proper state of mind when he finally decided to go through with the act. And when that malnourished and defeated voice in his head spoke up and said this isn't right, said get out of the car. That little bitch told him to get back in. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> He expressed feelings that he didn't want to leave his family, on top of getting out of the vehicle when he first started it. He could have been helped.

Suicide is only an option for those who are terminally ill, people with no quality of life left to live.

Your reply is ignorant and unwanted. what she did is no different than someone who coaxes a mentally ill person to drink antifreeze because the thought crossed their mind. Suicide is almost always a symptom of other problems, something that until today I thought was common knowledge. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> She deserves a long jail sentence. She had the life of another human being in her hands, could have done any number of things to help him, and she didn't. She took someone who was confused and in a bad state of mind, and convinced him to take his life. 

This piece of garbage isn't human in my eyes. She's a disgusting stain that should face the same fate she pushed that poor guy to.

I've been on both ends of the spectrum of suicide, I've dealt with those thoughts myself and had a close family member take their life. I can't express how angry reading this makes me. I hope they impose the heaviest sentence on her that the law will allow. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm actively working with my therapist and psychiatrist to find coping skills and the right medicine regime. 

Thanks for the insight into applying for disability. I don't think its something that would pan out for me. I want to get back to work. And the idea of spending all that time and effort for something I may not need when I get it, if I get it at all, doesn't seem worthwhile. On top of that, I really believe I can get to a point where I can work within the next year or two. And I don't want to bog down an already slow system and impede other people who are worse off than myself. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I appreciate your advice, I really do. But what your suggesting isn't a possibility for me, at least not in the foreseeable future. I bring in no money of my own, so asking my family for the capital to attempt this would be necessary. Things are strained now between us, and asking for money for crafts when our fridge is nearly empty wouldn't go over well. 

I'd also face the issue of trying to sell them. I live in a rural area with the closest town 5 1/2 miles away. On top of which I have fairly severe anxiety, and talking to people I don't know is very hard. Trying to sell stuff to strangers makes me anxious just thinking about it.

Please don't misconstrue this as anything negative, that I'm unable to implement your idea. I'm deeply thankful you took the time to read my post and offer your insight. *Internet hug*

P.S. - I wasn't much of a Dickens fan in high school, but maybe I should revisit some of his works. I am a big fan of Orwell, have been since I read Animal Farm. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hello to all. My name's Joshua, Josh for short. I'm here because I need help, my family needs help. I'm not sure what to write, if I deserve to post here, but I need to try something. 

I've been unemployed for about a year now, give or take, due to health problems. Since I was young I've suffered from OCD, depression, bipolar disorder, ADD, and chronic insomnia. I never received help for it growing up, which has put me in a very bad spot. I'm 23, and I've worked seven different jobs since I was old enough to work. I've been forced to leave them all because of my mental health issues. The longest was a job as a cook at a fine dining restaurant that I managed to hold down for almost two years. I live with my mother and younger brother, who work to keep us off the streets. We live in my grandfather's house. We used to live with him, but he committed suicide last year on his 88th birthday.

My family works full time. My brother works especially hard, trying to help compensate for my lack of income. I'm on state insurance, and have been seeing a therapist and psychiatrist for several months. I'm slowly getting better, but its an uphill battle that's getting harder and harder to fight. The weight of the bills, the arguments, the unhappiness. All because of me and my inability to work. The stress and anxiety is killing me inside. I hate showing my face around them, knowing how miserable they are because I was born defective and can't contribute.

Which I guess brings me to the reason for this post. The bad weather has negatively affected both their jobs, and they haven't been getting the hours they were. We have bills that are past due, and their having trouble catching up. If there is anyone reading this who can help me, I'd get on my knees and beg you if I could. A monetary gift to help pay the outstanding bills, get our trash service back, and other small things. Things like cab fare to and from my appointments. My insurance doesn't cover medical transport, so if my mom is working and can't drive me, I have to take a cab. Because if I miss two or more appointments I have to reapply to be seen and it takes months so I can't risk it. Gift wasn't the right word to use, I'm not sure what is. Any help you can give me, I will repay. I promise you that. It may be a year or two from now, but I will reimburse for your kindness. My grandfather taught me to always pay my debts, and I do.

If your not in a position to help in a physical way, I'd love very much for someone to talk to. I don't have any friends and have no one I can talk to here. A kind soul who wouldn't mind talking with me would be an amazing gift in itself.

That's pretty much it, not sure what else to say. My anxiety has been terrible these past few days, and getting all this out has helped ease it.

Thank you for taking the time to read this, it means a lot to me.
