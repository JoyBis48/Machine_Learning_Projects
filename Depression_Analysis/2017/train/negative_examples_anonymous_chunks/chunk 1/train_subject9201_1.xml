	<TEXT> One thing about online play is it's very impersonal. It's less like going on a blind date, and more like hiring a hooker. They aren't going to ask you about your life unless you want them to, and even then, they probably don't care. [They are just single-serving friends.](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0137523/quotes?item=qt0479153) You don't have to worry about what they think, because the game will probably fall apart in a couple months, and you will never talk to them again. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The "retro" of retro-futurism means not current. I would say that 2012 is pretty current. We have retro-futurism for the 90s and early 2000s, it looks like [this](http://cdn-static.denofgeek.com/sites/denofgeek/files/styles/insert_main_wide_image/public/the_matrix.jpg?itok=omHlubMU). The problem is, we haven't really gotten to the "future" of those things yet.

Basically, things from those times are just considered futurism, not retro-futurism. </TEXT>

Retro-futurism is less about the progression of time since the piece of media was created, and more about the change in mindset, worldview, and aesthetic from what originally spawned it.

While it is neat to be able to pick out different combinations of things for a mini, most of those combinations already exist in mini form, for a lot less money, and both less fragile and better to be painted (or repainted).  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I actually mean it as both an insult and half a compliment. 

On the one hand, they should have taken the 4e rules and inserted them directly into a D D MMO without making a single change, and it probably would have been one of the greatest MMOs ever made. Instead they made Neverwinter, which was so half-assed, it was quarter-assed.

On the other hand, I have played so many rpgs, wargames, and board games, and yet none are as disappointing as 4e. Thing is, it's well designed. The problem is, it's only well designed *to be well designed*. Absolutely nothing it did translated to fun at the table for me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm going to assume you've never played a wargame, and never actually talked to an older player. 

The first edition of D D was based on wargames. Older players were playing wargames before rpgs even existed. There are lots of really great wargames made into RPGs that don't play like 4e, and they literally just add skills checks to wargame rules.

4e is nothing like a wargame, and is everything like World of Warcraft the board game. 

Sad thing is, I am a lover of RPGs, wargames, board games, and World of Warcraft, and I still can't stand 4e. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I love to play tactical wargames. In fact, I've used tactical wargame rules to run rpgs. The original D D was based on a wargame. 

Saying 4e is like a tactical wargame hurts me to my very wargamey soul.

4e is like a complicated board game is soooooooooooo much more accurate, and it doesn't burn the flesh off my ears when I hear it. </TEXT>

If I murder everyone in the world, is it not evil, since there is no one left to say otherwise?

Even after human beings go extinct, the evil that has been done, whether known by all or by none, will still be evil. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Chaotic Evil societies wouldn't have a problem with slaves. Sure, they don't have laws telling you you can own slaves, but they don't have laws telling you you can't either. They probably aren't going to have a system of laws and regulations on slavery, but Chaotic Evil people will keep as many slaves as they can keep under their control. 

It's less "I bought this slave, have the town guard bring him back" and more "You are going to work for me, and if you do well enough, I won't eat you today." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Laws are always good, right? This on a topic about a game that specifically has Lawful Evil as a thing. 

Early America had slaves, and everyone was totally cool with it. It's not like they [fought a full-blown war with themselves about it or anything](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War). 

"The bible says it's okay, so it must not be evil". I'm going to catch flak for this, I'm sure, but the Judeo-christian god would be Lawful Neutral, at best. Read the crazy shit it says you should be doing in Leviticus. 

And I suppose you think Nazis were pretty okay, right? I mean, they didn't even break any laws.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The first isn't wrong, it's just less clear. The second isn't pointless at all.  Saying any of it is part of having a discussion about the merits of using a particular system.

Games aren't made utter shit just because there is a rule in it that sucks. What's your favorite system? I guarantee it has problems. I guess you absolutely never recommend it to anyone. Since it has problems, it's pointless to talk about how you like it anyway, and how you work around those problems, right? God forbid someone have fun in a way you don't approve of.

Jumping on people for not wording things exactly the way you want is pretty shitty. Wanting to argue semantics instead of having a polite conversation about things people are interested in is pretty shitty.  </TEXT>
