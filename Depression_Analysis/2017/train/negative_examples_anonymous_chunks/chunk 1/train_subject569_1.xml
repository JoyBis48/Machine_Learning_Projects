	<TITLE> Sad Man or Pedophile...? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2012-11-27 09:36:16 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So... I can't remember as much detail as I'd like to about these encounters because they happened almost 10 years ago when I was in 8th and 9th grade but I'll tell you everything I remember.
 

I had just begun training to be on freshman football for the upcoming year and everyday after school I would take the bus to the high school I was going to be attending the next year and practiced for several hours with a small group of other 8th graders. Practice would end each day around 5:30 and most of the guys would have rides by 6. Not me. My parents have been notorious for picking me up late since as far back as I can remember.


I was sitting in front of the gym at the high school on my Sidekick 2 AIMing with some friends while waiting to be picked up but not expecting to be for at least an hour or more. There were still around 15 - 20 high school kids still waiting to be picked up hanging out in front of the gym but they were sitting on large steps about 30 yards from where I was. I was a shy little 8th grader so I sat alone on a brick stoop on the the sidewalk waiting to get picked up.


It was now around 6:20 when I noticed sitting about 20 yards down the stoop to the left of me was another person. I could tell he was African American and in kind of dorky cheap looking thrift-shop quality clothing but that was all I could see from the distance. I assumed he was just a high school student.  So I went back to my phone and continued chatting with my friends waiting for my parents to pick me up. It was probably now around 6:45 and the sun was beginning to go down. A lot of the kids had gone home. This was at the end of the school year so there weren't many Athlete's at school late. I think at the time all team sports had ended. I noticed that the guy was now sitting on the big steps right in front of the gym where the high school kids would sit, but alone, estranged, almost as if he was trying to blend in with the other kids even though he was not friends with them. I just assumed he was some dork or loser who wished he had friends.


I went back to my phone for a little and then decided to look behind to see how many kids were still left when I saw he was looking at me. When he saw I had looked at him he quickly looked away. I thought... "Oh, that was just one of those simple awkward moments when you accidentally lock eye contact with somebody. Totally innocent.." But I still hadn't gotten a good look at his face. 


Now, about another 20 minutes passed and it was now almost completely dark. The street lights had come on. A few kids were still around, but not many. The guy gets up and now comes and sits on the brick stoop I'm sitting on and is now maybe only 15 feet away, and I can now get an actual good look at him. He was much older, maybe early thirties, light skinned, mildly overweight with short curly light brown hair. He had a real innocent boyish looking face but you could tell he was older. He had light blue eyes too. I got really creeped out at this moment but then thought, maybe he just seems older and is just a high school student. Maybe I'm being too paranoid. I saw he had no backpack, to which I then thought, Oh, it's probably on the big steps. He wasn't right next to me, he was probably just a high school kid I thought. 


So, now at this point there's only 2 kids still waiting to get picked up, besides me and this creepy guy. I realize he keeps looking at me and smiling like he's trying to get my attention. I look at him and I smile, just to be nice because at this point I've convinced myself he's a student. He smiles back. Nothing happens. I'm relieved, he didn't attack me or even start talking to me. He then sits there, constantly shaking his head back and forth smiling, and like rubbing his upper thighs on top of his jeans. This goes on for about 15 minutes and I message my friends about this weird guy and how "funny" it is. I really thought he was probably just some unfortunate high school kid who looked much older than he actually is... That's until the last 2 kids waiting to get picked up leave. I remember them just walking down the street instead of getting into a car and me being left alone with what I thought might be a pedophile. About a minute passed and he came and sat right next to. Our thighs were touching. My heart started racing a million miles a second. He kept rubbing his leg in a sexual way when he sat next to me.


"Can I help you?" I asked in a harsh tone that implied he was it my personal space. 


"Can we be friends?" he said with a sinister grin


I got scared and got up and started running with my backpack on. I ran to a hotel 5 blocks from where I was because I was so freaked out. I could tell he wasn't a student, but I had the security of the other students nearby in case anything happened so I could just ignore his ominous presence. When I saw him looking at me from a distance and then slowly creeping up to me, it just felt so weird I didn't care if he was just some losery guy, which I later realized he wasn't... But after that moment I felt I might have been a little mean. Like, what if that guy actually, wanted to be friends, and I just made him feel like the ultimate loser by running away because he has no social skills? This lingered with me for a little bit until after seeing this guy some places a few more times I realized, A. He was not a student of my high school and B. He was not the age of students in high school. 


--------------


So the first thing I'll say is, this man was very memorable. His face, his look, the whole experience. When I saw him again I was sure it was him. I could undoubtedly pull him out of a line up of lookalikes, nobody looks like him, he just had this creepy aura about him. Very very very creepy. I saw him 2 more times after the first time and I remembered all his weird little mannerisms. I say this because I know he was not a student at the high school at the time or anytime after because I went to the high school and never saw him, and because of the following encounter... 


So, it was my freshman year of high school and it was Homecoming night. I wasn't on the Varsity team so I was in the crowds with some friends. I had some older friends and they asked if I wanted to leave the game and go to the park nearby and smoke some weed. I said yeah and we walked to the park about a block from my school. When we got there one of the older guys pulled out a joint and we all started smoking it. It was one of my first times getting high so I really enjoyed it. We were all starting to feel the effects of the Marijuana and started to become more giggly and joyful. We decided we wanted to go play on the swings and go on the jungle gym. 


So we started toward the kiddie area where we weren't expecting to see anyone but did... A  lone figure was sitting on one of the swings just kicking his feet in the dirt. At first we assumed it just another high school student but as we got closer we saw it wasn't another student, it was the creepy guy! I quickly said to everyone "Oh, my, God, I think that guy is a pedophile or rapist or something, I swear, last year I swear he was like checking me out or something and then like asked me to be his friend but I ran away." One of the older guys said "That guy is definitely a pedophile." I asked them "Have you ever seen that guy at the high school before?" and they said "No, that guy's like 35." These were current Seniors, so I knew he hadn't graduated the year before, you would recognize him for looking so much older, he's just some creeper who hangs around the high school. I remembered how bad I felt for him when I thought he might have just been some horrible loser who wanted friends, but then I thought there was probably something more sinister at play. I wasn't the only one who thought he was a little too old to be hanging out around high school kids... So, we decided to go play at another end of the park because this guy was too creepy. 


--------------


The last time I saw him was later that year, when I think about it it still gives me the chills. It wasn't as if he had actually done anything to me accept look at me, smile, and ask to be friends... He never assaulted me or nor did I ever see him assault anyone, so, it's not like I could ever report him for anything... But this was the creepiest for me. I went to the Public Library after school one day to do homework because I had had a lot of work culminating over time and I was going to force myself to finish it all before I left the library... or so I thought. I went to the back where it's very academic. About 16 tables, everybody working in pure silence, lots of shhhh's, lots of hard work getting done.


I sit down at one of the only two free seats. Everybody is absorbed in whatever work they were doing. I remember the man across from me looked like a homeless African American man writing a screenplay by hand on notebook paper. "That's awesome" I thought. I assumed it was probably really interesting... whether it was crazy or genius, the screenplay of a homeless man would be an interesting read... But then I stopped thinking about that because I noticed somebody in the computer section just beyond the section I was in. It was the creepy guy and he was using a computer 30 feet away from me. Just then a woman came and sat next to me. I can't remember the details of who she was but I do remember the relief of the open seat next to me being filled. I began to feel safe like I did the first day I saw this man. 


I began to start my History assignments, I was safe in public, and best of all.. he couldn't get near me. I had gotten a good thirty minutes into reading when I noticed at another table the creepy guy had sat down and started to do some work. I tried to ignore it and just think to myself he was just a sad guy with really bad social skills trying to better himself at the library. (I hoped) He probably didn't even notice me. The library was still packed. I was safe... So I went back to work and tried to ignore any thoughts I had of this man and focus on my History... That's when it happened. About an hour after creepy guy sat down to start his work the woman who had been sitting next to me started to put her stuff away. She packed her books into her purse and left. The seat next to me was free, as were many others. I thought, "How creepy would that be if that guy came and sat next to me... Nah... that won't happen... he has a seat. That would be super creepy and suspicious. There's no way that's gonna happen." And then it happened. He picked up all the stuff he was working on and came and sat down right next to me. He even had a big smile while he did so.  He came to my table and sat next to me. I looked at him for one second and he had a creepy smile on his face as he was looking at me. It scared the living shit out of me. I quickly stood up. Grabbed my book and notes, shoved them in my backpack and quickly fast walked to the entrance of the library.  


I never went back to the library again after that day and always made sure I only hung around groups in public places. Luckily I never saw the man again. But in that moment, when he sat next to me, I knew he had been watching me... For how long, who knows? Waiting... Hoping for something... For what? Something I'm glad I'll never know...

TL;DR: When I was 14   15 a much older creepy man watched me from afar and slowly got closer to me until he sat down right next to me scaring me so much that I would run away. Once after school when I was the only kid there waiting to be picked up by parents in the dark many hours after school had ended, and once at the public library where he knew I was afraid of him. </TEXT>
