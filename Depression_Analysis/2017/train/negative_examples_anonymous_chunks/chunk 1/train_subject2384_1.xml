	<TEXT> Economists' opinions mean nothing. They are not very good at predicting the stability of the economy. A majority of economists thought things were going fine in 2008 before the market crashed.

They're glorified historians. And I don't mean to insult historians, at least they're honest about the fact their work deals with more the past than the present. </TEXT>
