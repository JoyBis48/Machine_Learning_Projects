	<TEXT> not sharp

What do you mean it's not sharp? 

 b w for no reason. F

It is B W, because I think that the picture looks a lot better as in color.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I know already that IPv6 won't influence my ping. The routing of my IPv4 traffic is different from my IPv4. 

My IPv4 traffic is routed through the DS-LITE Gateway of my ISP and not directly. 
Because of this I don't have a dedicated IPv4 address myself, I'm sharing my IPv4 address with a lot of other users. 

This in turn means that at evening, were more people are using the internet connection, the connection to the DS-LITE Gateway is a little bit jammed, but my IPv6 isnt at all (because it would directly connect to Smite). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi!

Does smite natively support IPv6? I'm asking, because I wont get no real IPv4 address anymore from my ISP. He only gives out IPv4 via DS-LITE (Carrier Grade NAT). The main disadvantage is that every evening my IPv4 ping raises to about 150ms, but my  IPv6 ping is steady at about 20 to 30 ms. </TEXT>
