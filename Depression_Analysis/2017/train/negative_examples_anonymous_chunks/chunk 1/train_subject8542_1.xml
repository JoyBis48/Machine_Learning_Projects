I am getting better with graveyards though. But I did have to sort of.. blank out for a funeral when the coffin ws being lowered. I think I  drifted off until I was tapped on the shoulder. </TEXT>

 I get anxious to fuck when going visiting my Grandad/Nan's grave (Buried together) For a while, I used to just sit in the car while my Mum/dad/siter went to visit.

I don't really even know what it is. The fact that there's hundreds of dead bodies 6 feet below me is enough to freak me out. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Apprentice here:

I was taken on at 17 and I'm fortunate that they started me off at Minimum wage (at the time - 4.50 an hour) but the staff turnover for the department I was in was insane. Apparently, I lasted the longest (2 1/2 years) before moving department because the whole thing was just soul sucking, boring and depressing

(I was in the IT preparing area. Computers on the DSA)

Shifted into the warehouse, but still working (I think. My NVQ provider still hasn't got back to me.) on NVQ Level 3 IT Practitioner.

It's good for experience and for fresh out of school kids, but for the most part, you're an intern. Everything gets dropped onto you, because you're fresh meat.

	<TEXT> So I went outside earlier, and looked up. I could have sworn I was too close to the city to see stars, but there they were. 

I can't remember the last time I just stood there in the cold, looking up at them. Must have been during school. And that was at least 6 years ago now. Probably more.

It's a beautiful thing - looking up at night. 

All those stars. Each one has other planets, some possibly even holding life. Hey, for all I know, there's intergalactic transport passing by right now. Not making contact for some crazy law where they're not allowed to make contact or something.

I just stood there for 20 minutes. Mind temporarily blown.. And I'm not even high! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I get weird shit like this happening to me all the time. Usually, I'm at home when stuff decides to come out and play, but last night, it picked the perfect moment to scare the living bejeezus out of me.

The darker nights are rolling in sooner each night, and last night - it caught me totally off guard.

I'd been walking the dog down a reclaimed landfill site, and up until recently, it had been perfectly light enough to take a nice brisk walk up and down the entire length of the area (a good 3 miles or so.) But last night, the darkness got there before I did. 

I'm too stubborn to call it off and go walk on a nice lit pathway with the dog. So I pulled out my torch and set off walking.

This pathway is completely covered by trees. Only letting cracks of light in between the leaves. It gives off a very creepy atmosphere.  It was a very cloudy night, anyway. Not much bright moonlight to go by.

Anyway, I'm going off the point here. I'm walking along this big long dirt path, and I can hear rustling in the trees on either side of me. My dog isn't stopping to check - so I assume it's probably some little squirrels or something. In retrospect, what the hell made me think squirrels would roam at night? 

So I'm a little edgy, but the dog doesn't seem to care, so I carry on.

I'm about a mile into the walk, and I approach what I've dubbed "The Creepy Hut."

This creepy looking building is an old sewage control building. The old iron door is still attached, but the doorway behind it is bricked up. the old brickwork a much darker, redder colour than the freshly placed doorblock bricks.
During the summer, the plant life around it goes wild and obscures it from view, ivy growing on its old roof- hanging off the edges, and grass almost as tall as me surrounding it.

But it's just starting to get into autumn, and the grass is wilting, and the ivy is getting brown.  The place reeks of rotting stuff all year round, but today the stench seemed awfully stronger than usual. 

I covered my face with my coat, shone my torch over the old hut and froze.

There was a person in front of the old iron door. He was slouched, slightly. Looking like he was breathing heavily. Or laughing. I wasn't sure - I was too far away.

My dog had seen this, and he'd also stopped dead in his tracks, staring at the strange man in front of the door. His ears were high, tail curled upwards.

The man slowly started turning around. I aimed the torch at his torso, so that the light would slightly illuminate his face. Don't want to blind him!

Bad idea. His face was lit up sort of like when you used to shine the torch under your chin at camp, telling spooky stories. Except this time the man's face was half rotted. He had the shit-eating grin spread right across his face. He slammed this big iron door shut with his left arm, and I swear it took a brick or two from the bricked up doorway with it. 

(Note: This door is heavy as hell. I tried moving it a few months back after taking some pictures of the place, and it was very hard to move, even with all 220lbs of me behind it.)

I just turned back towards the car and ran. Dog had the same idea - He barrelled past me, barking his head off. I didn't want to turn around and see what the man was doing, but curiosity got the better of me. I quickly turned and began backpedalling, and he was just stood where I was - on the pathway. I could see his shape in the limited moonlight, Hunched over.

That was it. I ran the mile back to the car, unlocked it on the run, opened the door, threw myself in and locked it behind me. Turned the engine and lights on, and turned the car to face where I had come from. The high beams on my car headlights weren't enough to pierce all the way through the trees, but I would at least be able to see him coming. Nothing. 

The Dog had barrelled into the car right beside me, so I just took off home.

I swear he was stood at the gate to the car park on my way out. Waving. Like he'd hoped I'd come back soon.

No chance, mate.

I have pictures of both outside and inside this place if anyone wants them </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Indeed. You always hear of "This is the new MMO - it will surely kill WoW this time!" 

Rather than attempting to just usurp WoW off the MMO Throne, it'd be cool if the devs could try and concentrate on an original concept for an MMO, rather than the run of the mill 3rd person action-y RPG.

It works, but sometimes you just need something new. And with everyone developing these kind of games, there's not that much difference between the lot of them. 

Makes the whole market stale. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi Swimmit!

I crashed my car about a week and a half ago, and I'm currently suffering from whiplash, a sprained wrist, and a bad back.

It's easing off a little bit, and the pain only hits me bad when I lean over, or move my wrist a little too suddenly (That's with my painkillers, though)

Is there any kind of swimming technique I could use to sort of get back in the water, or would you guys advise staying out for a few more weeks? I miss having my after work swim. :(  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Little late on the posting, but hey.

There were about 15 of us in Birmingham city centre on saturday. We invaded a pub, talked (quite loudly) and received ponies. 

Then we went on a march to somewhere, which involved walking past a big church while playing Pony music through an iPod dock speaker. That was kinda weird.

Then we went through the city shopping centre, waving a flag and singing Winter Wrap Up. That was kinda surreal.

Then we found a shop which sold pony merch, and we acquired more pony.

In short..

	<TEXT> I don't get it. You're toeing the line as it is by driving with no insurance, yet you drive like a lunatic.

You drove down the wrong side of a road, leading into a junction, then you pull out of said junction (It had Give Way signs!) without looking while I'm coming down the main road. Smashy.

I've got a burn up my left arm, a big-ass cut up my left arm and now I think the whiplash is deciding to make itself known. Shoulders and back are achey, and my neck hurts to turn. I thought I was having a heart attack on scene, the airbag went off right into my chest and the pain wouldn't go for about 5 minutes.

Luckily (unfortunately for the company I work for, though) I was working at the time and I was using a van. My little car wouldn't have stood a chance and I might have been seriously injured now. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Watching Over Me. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2011-09-11 15:16:59 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> This happened last night, so I can remember pretty much everything in vivid detail. I've probably had about 3 hours sleep.

It was a relatively normal day. I'd gotten back from walking the dog a few hours ago. I walk him on the site of an old landfill, now cleaned up and is a popular horse riding trail. I usually head off the path after heading past an old and abandoned sewage control building, as to not disturb any riders with my very excitable Border Collie.

I was walking among the trees, alone, when I heard the fallen branches behind me snapping, like someone was walking on them. I turned around expecting to see someone walking behind me - there was no-one there. 

Putting it down to my imagination, I carried on walking along the woods. The sounds continued all the way along the woods, only stopping when the ground cleared up.  I thought nothing of it, until last night.

It didn't start off so bad, just the odd footstep here or there. I live in a old house, creaks are expected. But then 1am happened. My door (which is kinda sturdy) was closed. The handle turned and it flung open, slamming into the desk I was sat at. 

Expecting to see my mischievous little sister there, I stood up and poked my head out of the door. 

*"What'd you do--"* 

There was no-one there.  The floor outside my room is creaky, I'd have heard her running off. I shook my head, closed my door - locked it - and carried on with what I was doing.

about 10 minutes later, I was about to grab my glass and take a drink. It slid along the desk, away from me. I stared at it for a second or two, wondering if my mind is just seriously messing with me.  Then it just fell over. 

I'd had it with my room, I was going to go downstairs to watch a bit of TV, and hang out with my dog.  I got downstairs and he was sat right at the door to the stairs, whining quietly. He saw me open the door and wagged his tail furiously. He's normally sleeping on the rug at this time. He must have heard the glass fall over and got spooked.

I eventually ended up asleep on the couch around 3am, BBC news playing quietly in the background, but my dog was still staring at the stairs door.

It was about 5:30am when I woke up. I cursed myself for falling asleep on the couch when there was a perfectly good bed upstairs. I turned around and someone was stood there. At first, I thought it was my mum, coming to check on me, after a few seconds on refocusing it was my Nan. 

My still half-asleep brain relaxed a little - then it hit me - my Nan had been dead for 3 months - She died in July. I faced both my phobias in one day to attend the funeral of the woman who had cared for me all my life.

I freaked out. I sat up, and threw myself over the arm of the couch. Running into the kitchen, I heard scrambling right behind me. I opened the knife drawer and pulled one out and switched to a defensive position.  

It was just my dog following me frantically into the kitchen whimpering and whining.  I threw some water over my face from the sink and slowly popped my head around the corner, back into the living room. No-one there. I got a torch from the back room and used it to navigate my back up to my bedroom.

(Woah, that was long. That's what happened to me last night.) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey all! This is my second story on here. I have a few more, completely nonrelated to each other. I might post them if I can remember the details. Anyway, here goes;

I was 18, I'd passed my driving test about 6 months ago, and we were in the city, playing video games at the Gamerbase, in Manchester, under the HMV.  It was about 10:30 when we left the place, and started the walk back to the car. 

It was an unremarkable walk, nothing to report, just me and my friends talking about whatever came to mind. Mostly video games.

We got to the car, and the place was empty. Of course, it was 11pm on a sunday night, there won't be too many people about. We got in the car and set out.

We must have hit the East Lancs road about 11:15. We're driving down the road, still talking. I was concentrating on the road. I was still a newbie after all.

The exit for Bolton was coming up, I took it and started speeding up on the motorway. I hit 60MPH on the long straight road. I saw a small movement in the distance. A low hanging tree brance, maybe. I carried on.

Suddenly, a young girl dashed out and lept over the safety barrier. I slammed the brakes, but I couldn't stop in time, there wasn't a chance. 

Her legs buckled from the bumper hitting her. 

Her side hit the bonnet, I saw her body twist, and her face slammed into my windshield. I don't think I've been any closer to losing my mind than I did at that moment. Her face was crushed against the hard glass. 

But she had this... Grin which shook my spine like an earthquake. I was so very tempted to just leap out of my car right at that moment. I kept my cool, and got the car to a stop. (albeit, in the middle of the road, but still)

I opened my door and lunged out of the car and took off up the road to help the person I'd just mowed down. My friends scrambled into action, They thought I'd lost it and chased me up to road to stop me. 2 stayed behind to push the car into the hard shoulder.

I was stunned. I only ran a few meters before stopping. There was nothing there. No body, no blood. Only my skid marks in the road. 

I was so certain of what I saw. My friends took me back to the car and we sat outside it for a while. My car was clean. No blood, no dents, no cracked windows. 

Nothing.  

I was certain for days I had gone mad. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> [Original!](http://www.reddit.com/r/creepy/comments/h5rd5/bricked_up_doorway)

[Got an album in here](http://imgur.com/a/Bn6yE#63vOa)

[Picture the album upload seemed to miss](http://i.imgur.com/vF7gD.jpg) 

It had absolutely lashed it down with rain last night, so I was lucky I didn't drop my phone (Yeah, my phone has a 12Megapixel camera in it) with the amount of slipping I was doing.
On the approach, it absolutely reeked of rotting stuff. I can't pin it, it was just unholy and had to cover my face, otherwise I'd have emptied my lunch all over the wall.

I took two pictures of the interior and started getting the serious heebie-jeebies, and the smell was starting to penetrate of waterproof coat, so I hightailed it outta there.

Enjoy!

(Sorry for the slight confusion. I messed up with my postings.) </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I played pretty seriously back in WotLK, and participated in a realm second Lich King Heroic 10 Man.

Since Cataclysm's release, I've stepped back a little bit and not played as seriously. I've had a lot of jip from guild members and been branded as if I'm in for the loot.

This is by no means a description of me. I'm far from it.

I play the game as what it's meant to be. A Game. I don't care for loot, or who goes into raids instead of me - I know what it's like to be a raid leader, it's a pain in the arse to find a right setup.

I like to Roleplay, but by no means is it a requirement for me. I'm willing to transfer to any realm on the EU rack. 

[Here's](http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/character/nagrand/zeifer/simple) my main character - a hunter - on the armoury. 

I will be transferring my level 43 hunter over, though. I still have a few friends on my current server and I wouldn't like to lose most contact with them. (I'm currently on Nagrand EU)

I will be able to level this up in a week or 2, though.

I would prefer Horde too, so I wouldn't have to cough up for a Faction Transfer also.

I know it's a long shot, but I hope to hear back from interested people. :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> First nosleep post. I've had a couple of freaky experiences where I live right now, I'm on a lunch break at work atm, so I've only got the time for one, so here goes. :)

It was a warm summer night. Unusually warm for northern england, even in the middle of summer.

I was sleeping with no covers over me, just wearing my boxer shorts.

I must have woke up around 3am, lying on my side, greeted by the sight of my black wallpaper. I sighed heavily, knowing I'm not going to be able to fall back asleep now. Hah! If only I knew!

I slowly turned onto my back, to face the roof. I expected to see my Alchemy Gothic "Devil take the Wyrm" poster right above me. What I saw instead curdled my blood, yet I couldn't bring myself to do anything.

A disembodied head, gnarled features. Missing an eye. His other eye, bright red staring right back at me.

He grinned. His teeth (those which were left, anyway) were a horrible shade of yellow. 

The light coming from the side of me illuminated his face with a pale blue glow. I slept that night with the curtains open, I regretted it right at that moment, it made everything so much spookier.

Time seemed to freeze for what felt like an eternity. I couldn't move, it was like he had me pinned down.

And then he vanished.

I heard a car squeal its brakes in the distance, then an engine roar.

I didn't sleep for days afterward, fearing he would visit again when I wasn't expecting him. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey Doggit!

Just thought I'd ask, as my dog's been doing this for years and I'm curious as to why he'd be doing it;

Everywhere I walk my dog, he'll stop, sniff and start licking something he finds interesting. Be it a plant, the concrete floor, a wall, tree stump. Anything. He doesn't do it at home though, which is strange.

I find this slightly weird, and all google searches only really come up with dogs licking carpets at home.

If it helps any, he's a Border Collie, about 8 years old now. </TEXT>
