	<TEXT> There was homophobia?

Edit: Thanks for the prompt responses, I remember the "boy-lover" quote but I kind of consider that just criticism of pedophilia. It's still completely historically inaccurate for the Spartans to be critical of that, but I wouldn't say it's "homophobic" in itself.  But from what you're all telling me this Miller dude does sound like an asshole, and he probably is a homophobe himself. </TEXT>
