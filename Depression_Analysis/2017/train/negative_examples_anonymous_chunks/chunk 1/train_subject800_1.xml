Following to that, I use to imagine my testimony in a trial, explaining how the accident had place and defending myself. Also I use to imagine myself arguing with some drivers that find I'm a nuisance in the road.

(fuck , my english is so poor right now...)

I've had this obsessive thoughts for years, but lately they have decreased in intensity, I got used to them, partially thanks to the help of my therapist. I've learnt to accept this thoughts as a part of me and not get upset  about them. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes, it has been helpful for me.

First of all, talk helps. You blow off steam and you put your thoughts and feelings in order as you talk.

Very probably, you won't only talk, you'll do therapy, you'll do practical exercises with your doctor that will help you evolve.

I've been through three different therapists in my life and every one of them have helped me solve different problems. I'm not perfectly sane now but I wouldn't be who I am today if not for them.

In the other hand, you need to be lucky and find the right doctor. Some of them are not very motivated or just try to push you on pills. Be careful with pills. They can be helpful if you have real problems, but they have some side effects they don't talk you about. You can get fat, or feel numb or sleepy, or just feel neutral and devoided of any feelings. Pills are not the only answer for everything. I know some people who had some problems and tried going to a therapist, and the first thing he did was prescribing him pills. He declined and later solved his problems himself without medication. But not everybody can do that, of course. Some people really need medication.

Try to make your doctor to inform you about your medication, to tell him what are you gonna take, and why, what the pills do, and what side effects they have. You have the right to be informed. There are some things that your therapist won't tell you if you don't ask. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm happy for you. But be careful. If you start to feel bad again, don't be scared. It's something natural. Don't feel it like a failure. Remember that's a state you know well, and it can't get worse than you alreadey has experienced.

I say don't be scared because recently I had an axiety attack after a long period of feeling really great, and it felt terrible. I was terrified about going down again, I felt like I was going crazy. But I didn't.

One of my therapist warned me: I was doing a great progress but I could have bad moments again. She said sometimes your mind is resilient to stay stable and happy because you have been feeling bad for so long, and you are used to it.

Anyway, good luck. Take advantage of this new state and make some plans to organize and improve your life, so you stay happy as long as you can. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Meds, therapy, life experience and getting older, mostly. I've been through three different therapist. Every one of them have helped me changing different problems. These changes have reverted in my daily life and my self-perception, making my mind more clear and calm, reducing symptoms like rituals. Also, I think i just grew older and learnt some things that help me have things more clear in life. I still have depression, anxiety and self-steem problems, but much softer since I'm going to the last therapist.

Also I've been under anti-depressants and antipsychotics for many years, and I guess they are in some part the reason of this changes. But mostly, therapy and learning. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm much better now, but still have intrusive thoughts. Whenever I'm riding my bike I imagine an accident, a car hitting me, falling to the ground, smashing my head. Or I imagine other drivers complaining about how slow I am or my erratic direction.

The more usual thoughts are negative ones, about how wrong everything is, how badly I do things, all my mistakes and faults. My mind is always looking for reasons to feel bad and guilty. Whenever I do something, there is a voice in my head whispering: "You are doing it wrong. YOU are wrong".

The worst ones are about raping little kids. I know I would never do that nor I'm attracted to that but just having those thoughts popping on your head automatically whenever you see a little kid, damn, it's scary. Luckily this kind of thoughts are not usual anymore.

When I was a teenager I use to have rituals like touching things the same amount of times in the left and in the right. I was obsessed with simmetry. I could spin a jar to the left, then feel obligated to spin it to the right to balance things. Then again to the left, but in a minor angle, again to the right... and so on until the handle stayed in the center.

In hindsight, I think I'm getting better every year, so I still have hope and so you should. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Actually I'm seeing a therapist again (a new one) partially because I was having too many suicidal thoughts and me and a friend were getting worried.

Now I don't think about it so much, I guess I got little better. But not long ago I was thinking again and again about ending it all. About the final solution. I usually thought about it when I felt depressed or useless or anxious or lost, but this thought came also to my mind in some strange moments. I remember one day visiting a friend and his girlfriend. I was playing on his XBox and he was in the kitchen making cheese sandwiches. For a moment I felt so out of place I suddenly thought "You have to kill yourself. You just have to do it. There is nothing else to do. That's the right solution". 

I think this is the weirdest moment I had this thought.

But yeah, suicidal thoughts, a lot. Whenever I felt that I couldn't stand this anymore, this state of perpetual sadness and anxiety. That would end the suffering, but I don't want to quit struggling. I want to fight till the end. I want to see it all and feel it all, even if my life ends like a big fail. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When you are alone in your house, try having a rational monologue. Not a mental one. You have to use your voice. Release energy and frustration. If you have to curse, curse. If you have to yell, yell. But be rational. Rationalize your problem. Give yourself questions and answers. What's the problem? Can I find a solution? If not, what I'm gonna do about it? Try to take out all that is in your mind, so later there will be less things to think about.

I'm not a therapist. I'm talking from my experience. Sometimes talking about an obsession and rationalizing it helps. Later there will be less things to think about because you already have come to some sort of conclussions.

Talking with a friend helps too.

It's possible that the obsession continues, though, but try it at least. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think the album I've used the most times in my games is the Fight Club Soundtrack. It's perfect for games set in dark modern times.

	<TEXT> The basic concept around Unknown Armies is that you can have power but it has a high price. The more you sacrifice, the more power you get. There are, for example, epideromancers, who must hurt themselves in order to gain magic charges.

There are also "demons". Rumors say if you can summon one, you can make him help you, give you power and information. But: 1. They just want to control you. 2) They are not really what people think they are. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Try to face your triggers and your intrusive thoughts, as long as you can. Don't let them have control on you. I know this is easier to say than to do it. I mean: don't fear your problems, accept them as part of yourself, at least of a temporary self. Expose yourself to your fears, alway as far as you can and under your control. Focus on your intrusive thoughts, don't try to cut them out your mind. If you fight something it becomes your enemy. Try to accept what you feel and think. The problems will not disappear but maybe they will be easier to stand and you'll relax a little.

These are some things that I read in a book my therapist recommended me and worked in my case. I hope they work in yours. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks.

I can say I have pure-o then. I feel better when I can give something a name, I don't know why. It's interesting that all my therapist have always avoided to use terms like these, I wonder why.

But knowing that my problem has a name and there is more people like me out there calms me down. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What is pure-O? Is the first time I've read about this term. Maybe is because I'm from Spain and here we use another terminology or maybe because my therapist have been trying to not use thechnical terms with me so I wouldn't obsess about them.

Is it just a mental obsession? Like something without rituals or compulssion? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You could just tell your parents you feel anxiety and have problems focusing on school, or even maybe that you think you have some kind of OCD symptoms, that you overthink things and have too much "mental noise" to focus on your work and want to improve your marks. You are not obligated to tell them exactly what kind of disgusting thoughts you have. Keep that to yourself and your therapist.

About things being normal again, well, I'll talk from self experience. Is very dificult for a person with mental illness go back to total normality forever. If you go to a therapist and have the appropiate medication you can get really better and have a better life. Your symptoms can weaken a lot, but accept that maybe now and then they can come back for a while and have a bad time. But very probably your thoughts will turn into a minor nuisance.

I've have intrusive and obsessive thoughts for years. I'm going to therapy and taking medication and now I'm much better. I still have the same thoughts about accidents when I'm riding my bike, for example, and imagine how somebody assaults me while I'm walking in the street, but they are weaker now. Sometimes I have an argument with somebody or feel very guilty about something, and that ruins my whole day. I fall in a depressive spiral and spend the rest of the day in the bed. But this happens very ocasionally, now.

What I'm trying to say is you can get better, but maybe you'll still have some symptoms or bad times, now and then. One thing I've learnt going to the therapist is to accept the way I am, to accept my intrusive thoughts as a burden or nuisance, to not obsess about them.

Another thing Ive learn in therapy: exposure therapy. Face your problems. Expose yourself to them. Look, triying to analyze or rationalize your bad thoughts is like trying to turn off a fire with gasoline. You are just feeding the machine. Instead of falling in a rational feedback, fighting thoughts with thoughts, focus on them. Look them to the face. Repeat them in your mind again and again. Surrender, don't fight. "Okay, you want to think about this? Let's think about this". Repeat the bad images in your imagination again and again, this time under your own will and control. The pictures appear because you want. Verbalize them, turn them into a simple sentence and repeat it again and again and again. Your brain soon will get bored of this, the thought will loose control on you and you'll pass to something else.

Problem is, this technique can turn into another obsession. It's effectiveness is temporary.

You are still young. In a pair of years you will feel much better. I'm 34 now. Started with therapy at 24 and I've evolved a lot. I'm not a perfect man but I got much better. Not saying you'll need so many years for your therapy, but be prepared to be pacient with your therapist and yourself.

I hope I helped you in some way with this brick I just wrote. :) </TEXT>
