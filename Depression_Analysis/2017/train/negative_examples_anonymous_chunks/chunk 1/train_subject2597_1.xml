	<TEXT> https://www.snapchat.com/geofilters/tips.html

The link guides you through how to make a geofilter for snapchat. Boulder has one (I'm not a fan of it),  but CU does not have one. While some off you don't use snapchat, some of you enjoy graphic design. Depending on how many people submit something, I may give out reddit gifts/gold. 
Ideas you may consider- notable buildings, Ralphie, the Flatirons, scenic area, or any design you can come up with.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> What happened to night skiing at Eldora? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-11-12 22:55:44 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I recently found out Eldora used to have night skiing but haven't seen anything on why they no longer offer it. Below is a night trail map. I'm guessing it had to do with forest service, night traffic on the canyon, or not being profitable. I've night skied at Keystone and it was empty but  I figure night skiing would do better at Eldora since it's so close to Boulder.

	<TEXT> Title says it all. Yes it is more basketball relevant but we're at the time where  other sports overlap. I wanted to post here to keep things a bit civil versus r/cfb and r/collegebasketball people yelling at Eachother. 

Has the UNC scandal changed your view on players receiving payment?

Personally I would be for taking for away scholarships and paying players under $100k. I'm not in favor of more successful schools getting to pay more money, then they just keep buying more talent and competition is gone.  </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2014-08-26 19:16:46 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I will have the epic local college pass but because of my schedule I won't get out to summit as often as I'd like (enough for the pass to be worth the money). I'm also considering the Elodora college pass ($159) since it's closer to Boulder. 

 I've never been to Eldora and know it's smaller but the bus from Boulder is a great appeal. I saw it's added to the WP/Copper pass which will add to the crowds. 

Would it be worth getting the pass for days that I can't make it to summit? Is the terrain/snow as bad as they say?  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I have a pair of 2012/13 liberty helixes. I bought them used and they had a demo binding on them (removed before I bought them). I was able to center mount them and rode them 3x before season end. I am considering remounting them to cab forward. I had salomon suspects for 5 years before this pair and had those center mounted as well. On the helix i was having difficulty staying afloat in the powder and initiating turns on groomers. I'm not sure if this is from not being used to the ski or if i should move my binding to cab forward. 
so should i try moving them knowing that once i do they are stuck there for good, and how should they hold up with 3 binding mounts done?

i tried finding a ski gear subreddit and the best was wintergear with no activity, if this should be in a different subreddit i will happily move it. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I know this girl personally and her charity has really taken off recently. I know she would love some more support. Here is the description written by her--

Hi! My name is Emma Rose. I am a 17 year old Leukemia (ALL) patient. I was diagnosed with cancer in January, 2012. It has been a tough year, but I am finally feeling better. I am in the maintenance phase of my treatment. Even though this is the "easiest" part of my treatment, it still consists of daily oral chemo and almost monthly spinal taps until May 2014. Since my diagnosis, so many people have helped my family and me in many ways. Now, I want to do something to give back. I want to help other kids with cancer who are also being treated at Children's Hospital of Wisconsin.  We collect comfort items the kids can use during their stay- especially pillow pets, soft blankets, fuzzy socks, iTune gift cards, ear buds, packs of gum, leggo kits, nail polish, glow sticks, and crayons. Our newest Wishlists are on Amazon. If interested in donating gifts to help the Kids at Children's WI, please go to Amazon, click on Wish Lists and then search for Emma Rose. We just completed a major donation drive called "Movie Night". Thanks to the generosity of our followers and WE Energies' donation of 100 copies of Honor Flight- The Movie, we were able to put together 100 movie tubs for the kids. Each tub contained several movies, popcorn, candy and other items for the children and their families. The tubs were given to the children on the HOT Unit, in MACC Clinic, in the BMT Clinic and at Ronald McDonald House. Since the children cannot go to the movie theater, I wanted to bring the movie theater experience to them. Thank you so much! Please make sure all donations are new and in their original packages. All mail and packages can be sent to Emma Rose, PO Box 485, Thiensville, WI 53092. Thank you so much for your generosity!  Emma Rose </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Now I already expect to get down votes shoved up my ass for this thread but I dont care because my life doesnt revolve around reddit karma. 
Before you downvote and click back without reading, read a bit of this. 
Why do people hate the Miami Heat? The answer- they all jumped on the hate train. 
1. Heat fans are bandwagon fans. Id like to argue that its cooler to hate the heat than like them. So by hating, you joined that band wagon. I became a Heat fan when they drafted Wade. I watched Wade a season ticket holder for Marquette. I never cared for the bucks because they never caught my interest. You dont have to be a fan of your local team, everyone has their reasons for liking a team. I was a fan before Lebron and the Big 3 yet everyone assumes Im a fan because of Lebron. Wade won Miami's first title in 2006.
Before someone says "Jimmy Butler played for Marq, shouldnt you be a bulls fan? No. While I love to see how well he is doing, Wade is still my favorite Marq player. Not just because of skill, but how he is off the court. Read up on his divorce and life with his sons.

2. "Lebron is a traitor/sellout"- Cleveland didnt have a chance of a title in the near future so Lebron went somewhere he could win. So what? Every player in the NBA wants to win a title. Its a lifelong dream for professional athletes. If your a Cleveland fan who hates lebron, you should be hating the management for not building a better team before lebron left. I dont mean a team around lebron or a superstar team, just a better team. 

3. The heat are a superstar team. So what? Part of basketball is trying to build a great team that will build a franchise. When you play pick up games you choose the best players first dont you? Do you all hate the Jordan era bulls? 

4. Bosh is a dinosaur. I dont mind people saying this. Its true and the memes are funny. Thats no reason to hate a player though. There are plenty of uglier players. 

5. Lebron is compared to Jordan. Thats the standerd for basketball, everyone is looking for the next jordan. Lebron has MVPs and Olympic Medals. He doesnt have the rings but look at his past. Cleveland had no chance. He made the finals his first year with the heat, won the finals the second year, had a 27 game winning streak the 3rd year. He is a damn good player. He is not Jordan. Having him compared to jordan is not a reason to hate him. NBA analyst will always compare great players to Jordan. Kobe gets compared. I dont hate Kobe for that or for being a great player. I dislike him because he has a record for being a selfish asshole who was accused of rape.... (Tosh.0 anyone?)

I'm not saying theres no reason to hate the Heat. Im just saying you should have your reasons and be able to back them up. My reasons listed arent perfect but they are a start. There are reasons to hate Miami, but be able to back yourself up so you arent just another person riding the hate train.

	<TEXT> What if Rose has not returned because the NBA secretly made him wait until the Bulls v Heat series.
Im not saying this is true or possible, just a thought that sort of fits. 
1. Heat beat bulls for a couple games, but not by a lot. 
2. Rose returns in game 3 or 4
3. Refs influence game or everything just seems to go against Miami
4. Rose and the Bulls take the next games needed to win the series
5. Bulls Heat rivalry heats up
6. Lebron leaves Miami 
7.

9. NBA Profit?? $$$ </TEXT>
