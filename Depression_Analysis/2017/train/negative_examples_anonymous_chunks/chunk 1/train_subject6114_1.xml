	<TITLE> [C] Proxy Server Sending Replacement Characters </TITLE>

	<TEXT> So basically, I'm writing a proxy server in C. It only needs to handle GET requests atm. I can take a GET request like very simple

GET www.amazon.com HTTP/1.0 

and then generate a request header like follows: 

    GET / HTTP/1.0
    Host: www.amazon.com
    User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:10.0.3) Gecko/20120305 Firefox/10.0.3
    Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8
    Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
    Connection: close
    Proxy-Connection: close

The proxy then forwards the request to the server in that form and reads the response. I get all the response headers back just fine, but when it comes to reading actual content and forwarding it to the client from the proxy I just get a bunch of replacement characters.

I don't really know why this is happening or how to fix it. 

If you need to see how I read from the response file (forward to client) I can post, but I don't think the way it is done has anything to do with why these characters are coming up. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The solution was actually really stupid actually. I was thinking along the same thing. I figured maybe the charging port had shifted or loosened and couldn't get enough current to charge. Turns out when it fell the charger was actually destroyed like at the end and my spare wasn't working either. Just needed a new charger. Damn I felt stupid. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As said in title - I just dropped my phone and it was almost dead so I tried to charge it and it no longer charges. Turned off/on, reset etc. I have no idea what to do? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I just searched around for them and only found one that looked like it - sadly without color :( If anyone knows I would love the one like the one on the car </TEXT>
