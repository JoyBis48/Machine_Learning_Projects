	<TEXT> I had an ArmaLite AR-10 pattern .308 gas gun and let me just say the aftermarket parts seemed a lot more geared toward SR-25/LR308 pattern rifles. I was very impressed with the overall quality of the AR-10 but it seems to me the LR-308 pattern may have been the way to go. RRA is, as I understand it, different mags and, through my adventures on the web, the least popular option. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I recently picked up a Core-15 M-4 that I'm slowly building into a coyote rifle, I posted a picture of it somewhat recently should you be interested. Currently the core has a 20" fluted bushmaster varminter barrel that I got a screamin' deal on, but I think that additional heft on the front end is exaggerating the slop between upper and lower. JP tension pin or deal with it? I would appreciate input from people that have used the tension pin or found a similar solution that doesn't involve foam earplugs... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> when i purchased an almost identical troy rail for my AR-10, it came with a section (maybe two, I can't remember correctly) of rail about 4" in length. I used it way out front for a bipod. Not sure if a company would include it if you didn't purchase the rail separately, though. </TEXT>
