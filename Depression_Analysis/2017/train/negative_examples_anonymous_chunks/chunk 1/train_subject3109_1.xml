	<TEXT> Always work if you can, it never looks good to have dead time on your resume even if it means taking menial employment. I have had very positive feedback from potential employers for this and I believe because of my strong work ethic that I've beaten out people who were more qualified then I because they had long period of unaccounted time (unemployment) on their resumes. Any employment is a learning experience good or bad. I've never applied for unemployment, employers really like to hear that.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thousands of dollars in Alcohol?

Maybe if you're drinking Gran Patrn Platinum but 80oz of beer ain't that expensive. And anything against your body will tend to get body temperature fairly quick which would tend to make most alcohols not very tasty except maybe brandy. However I think I would go with the Beerbelly mainly because I live in the south and a fat gut would not be out of place at most events. </TEXT>

Then I'll pass judgment on Hollywood Fl

I too once while stopped at red street light was rear ended by a drunk judge from another state when I told the cop I thought the man was drunk due to the over whelming stench of booze the cop told me to shut the fuck up and go sit on the curb or he'd arrest me and have the state take my son, which was quite a shock to my 5 year old son who was in my arms at the time, but other then that experience I respect the law.
