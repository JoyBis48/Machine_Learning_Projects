	<TEXT> Thanks for your response Lars0. I just read today about The Planetary Society utilizing a cubesat for their solar sail deployment. Before I was unaware such a thing existed. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What most adequately prepared you for your career in aerospace? If not adequately prepared, what would you have done differently to prepare for entering the field? I am a student working towards an undergraduate degree in mechanical engineering and would appreciate any advice you may have for someone with a desire to work in aerospace engineering. My request is not, however, intended to specifically target engineers. I am generally curious how you prepared for any position in the industry. Listing your current or past positions would be a great help as well. </TEXT>
