	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> AR style rifles or "assault weapons" as they are commonly referred to are the main target of gun control. IMO this is the direct result of sensationalism on behalf of the media. I believe that anyone who thinks that AR style rifles are any worse than any other gun is uneducated on the matter and should have no say. I believe that anyone who uses an AR style rifle as an example of why we need gun control is either A) a politician using fear mongering tactics to further their cause, or B) a voter who is uneducated on the matter and should not have a say. I believe so because AR (Armalite NOT assault rifle) style rifles function exactly the same as any other semi automatic rifle. The difference is that AR style rifles have creature comforts that make them easier to carry around and use for long periods of time (like when you're hunting). CMV.

	<TEXT> For the past few months I've had this thought/worry in my head. I know it's not true but I can't get it out of my head. It's this strange thing that I don't want in my head. If it were true then I would be shunned by society and I could be sent to prison. Again, I know it's not true but I still can't get it out of my head. 



Recently (past week) I haven't been able to stop thinking about it whereas I can usually push it to the back of my mind. It has caused me to become very depressed and stressed out. The thought that it could be true just pushes me over the edge. I don't know what to do. My research tells me that depression and anxiety can cause strange thoughts. If meds can get this thought out of my head and keep it from controlling my life then I want them. </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2013-12-20 01:48:19 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hey! So a few of my friends and I discovered an abandoned logging road awhile back. We drove pretty far down it until it became impassible via car. We scouted it on Google maps and it turns out it branches into a system of out of use logging roads, some of which lead to a coastal town that we all like visiting. Using Google's routing tool we discovered the whole trip would take ~8 hours on quads. But that figure could be off. We plan in borrowing a few ATV's, I believe the guy said they were 400cc Yamaha Utility quads.



What we plan on bringing:


Each Quad and rider will have:

*2 gallons of spare gas

*sleeping bag

*Camel Bak and spare water

*Hatchet+manual chainsaw

*Emergency water purification tablets and MREs

*Toilet paper

*Eating utensils

*Lighter

*clothes

*flair gun

*walkie talkie




Split between the three quads:

*tent

*gas powered chainsaw

*fire starters

*cooking stuff

*repair tools





Now I'm debating whether or not we need a collapsing toilet seat. We'll be about 20 miles from a major highway most of the time, but there will be logging camps nearby most of the time. Can you think of anything else we'll need. I think we might be able to do the trip in one day but I'm preparing as if we'll come across obstacles or won't be able to ride as fast as google suggests we can. It also depends on if there's anything we'll want to explore.  </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2013-12-14 09:25:47 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> John Marston has a special ability called "Dead Eye". It allows him to seemingly slow time while still retaining normal mobility, target enemies, and increase general combat effectiveness. 


In GTA V each character has their own special ability.


Franklin can slow time while driving.


Trevor takes less damage while dealing more.


Michael can slow time while shooting.


All three are watered down variants of "Deadeye". But wait! The plot thickens! In RDR John Marston has three conflicting personalities. He is a family man that just wants to get back to his family. He wants to better his lifestyle at all costs. He is a rough around the edges cowboy. 


Franklin has inherited the dreamer personality. All he wants is to get out of the ghetto.


Michael represents the family man. His end game is to be closer to his family.


Trevor represents the rough around the edges cowboy. Sure, he's insane, but he also has a caring personality. </TEXT>

Stewie has destroyed his time travel tech and has no way to build a new time machine. However, we also know from S4E30 that they have time travel tech in the future, and that future stewie (stu) is in possession of this technology.



My theory is that the Griffin's will make a time capsule for their future selves. Stewie will leave a letter for Stu in the time capsule begging him to come back to the present and help save Brian. We will then have an episode from Stu's perspective as he reads the letter and travels back in time to save Brian. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I know you guys are not lawyers but I thought I'd ask.



It seems like online bitcoin gambling is legal, or at least a grey area. Would the same apply to brick   mortar bitcoin gambling? Say you had a system where they sent you a bitcoin payment, and you then gave them an equivalent amount of chips. When it comes time to cash out, you send them a digital bitcoin payment. Since bitcoin is not considered legal tender (yet), would this get around gambling laws? It seems like it would because there is no exchange of cash between parties



Edit: US gambling laws. </TEXT>

I'm pretty heavy, 240 lbs, can I make weight in a 1.6 or should I try to find a 1.8?

--

On an ask reddit thread a few days ago there was a guy who mentioned he's part of a growing group that has decided not to identify as any race. Regardless of their birth race they have decided to mark, or write in, "other" as their race on forms.

--

There was a guy on reddit a few days ago asking how to tell his girlfriend that he wouldn't be getting her an engagement ring because it's an outdated practice.

--

Theres also the people who have decided to give everything a PC name. For example instead of referring to a male as just a man they feel the need to call them a cisgendered man.

--

Finally there was the guy who decided Sir and Mam aren't PC enough and is trying to create a gender neutral version.

Now I get these are of varying levels of extremity but I'd like your opinion on these types of people. </TEXT>

My questions:


1. Was it weird telling your parents that you were going to be in SI swimsuit?

2. Do you plan to continue modeling swimwear?

3. What has changed since you became famous that most people wouldn't expect to?

4. How do you react when guys on the street try to ask you out?

5. Is there any competition between the SI swimsuit models?

So I'm looking at an Evo viii/ix or a WRX right now. But I'm looking for alternatives because those are pushing it in terms of insurance ccosts. Any ideas? Must be fast, built post 2000, able to handle snow, and less than 14k. Manual transmission is a plus. It doesn't need to be a four door but I do need to be able to squeeze four people in. Also why do Evo IX's still cost 20k+ </TEXT>

Otherside - Macklemore (I'm not sure if this song is actually that sad. It might be because I was in a bad place because a close family member relapsed when I first heard it, and I associate it with that.)

There are a couple more I just can't think of them now. Will edit if I do. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A little background, I'm a senior in high school searching for work/paid internships over the summer. My high school diploma is coming with something that basically says I specialized in business   marketing while I was there. I'm not sure if other states do this, but here in Oregon it's called Career Aligned Mastery (CAM). For privacy reasons I will not put my resume up, but I have some questions.

Is it appropriate to list my tutor as a reference? If I'm applying for a summer job online can I say that I have a high school diploma? I have not graduated yet, but I will by the time I've started working there. Finally, do I mention the CAM or will they not care? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Context: you can get as much as you want, whenever you want, totally for free. BUT the drug has not been studied, so there is no way of knowing if it will screw you up in the long run. 

NZT-48 is the pill from the movie Limitless.

My answer: Yes I would. A drug that unlocks every scrap of information you have ever heard or seen in your life while simultaneously giving you limitless motivation is too good to pass up. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> REVIEW: Burger King Angry Whopper w/ Satisfries   a medium coke. ~$7.00 </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-10-15 23:02:38 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hey all! In preparation for college next year I've decided to start trying to live on less than $50.00 per week including food, transportation, and entertainment. Today I decided to spend a bit extra on lunch because I've started riding my bike instead of driving. The review will be broken into two parts: The angry whopper, and BK's new satisfries.

Angry Whopper: Initially I was going to get chicken strips, but when I saw the pic of the angry whopper I had to try it. It's your standard sized whopper with pepperjack, bacon, jalapenoes, and a spicy sauce. The picture made it seem like they would put french fries on the burger for you, however mine did not. I sat down in the BK and opened the box. The burger looked similar to the picture. It is pretty messy. It wasn't too spicy it just had enough kick to the point that you could feel it. all in all 7/10 (on the fast food scale).

Satisfries: (medium size) These were the reason I went to BK. I had been wanting to try them. They are crinkle cut, and healthier than the classic BK french fries. I didn't get ketchup so I just a them plain which was fine because they are decently salty. They're not crispy at all. I would compare them in terms of size and texture to steak fries. Despite the mixed reviews I enjoyed them. They have more of the soft potato filler stuff in them than your stereotypical fast food french fry. They tasted like the fries at 5 guys except less greasy. 8/10 just don't expect them to taste like BK's classic fries. </TEXT>
