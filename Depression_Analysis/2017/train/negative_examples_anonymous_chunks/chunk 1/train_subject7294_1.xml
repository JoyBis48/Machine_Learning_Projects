	<TEXT> CREATOR OF THIS POST, know that you have saved lives with this thread, thus saving many worlds. I thank you.

Also, I like to say that this reminds me of the theory: every thing you see is an illusion, a vision inside your head that you can not prove 100% to be real.
 If this theory is true that means that, with the power of your mind,  you can change the world anyway you want. </TEXT>
