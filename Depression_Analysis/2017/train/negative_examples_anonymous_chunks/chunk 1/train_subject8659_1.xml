	<TEXT> This is true. Unfortunately there aren't any real engineering firms in my area and I definitely don't want to work here. I was going to interview one of my civ professors who used to be a practicing engineer, but thought a current engineer would give more prevalent answers. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks for the quick reply! I'm a civil engineering student taking a professional writing course, and we needed to get someone in our related field to answer to above questions. If you wouldn't mind, I'd really appreciate it. Unfortunately, I'm a broke college student and cant pay the $110/hr fee :-P </TEXT>

	<TEXT> These are more or less the questions I need answered. Thanks a bunch!!

 how they function day-to-day as writers
 how often they write and what their process is
 what sorts of documentation they produce
 what sorts of problems and conflicts they face in writing situations
 what role technology plays in their professional communications
 in what ways and how often they collaborate
 what sorts of legal and ethical concerns characterize the climate in which they write
 what other sorts of communication issues arise in their environment
 writing advice they have for a young person entering the field.

	<TEXT> Try I-Doser clips. They are binaural soundtracks that are meant to simulate the brain waves you have when your one drugs. They never work obviously, but they make me pass out... its kinda like weird white noise.

	<TEXT> While in high school, I was a teachers aid for an 8th grade summer school program at the local middle school. There was some activity that involved the students labeling the oceans and continents on a black and white Mercator map. As if by high school I hadn't figured out where they were yet, the 20-something teacher I was aiding for kindly made me a key by labeling a map for me. To my initial shock, and eventual amusement, she labeled every single thing incorrectly. North America was the Indian Ocean, Asia was the Pacific, South America was Africa, etc.
I immediately gave this to my mother who was a teacher in the district. The teacher was not fired, but I was told given an atlas....   </TEXT>
