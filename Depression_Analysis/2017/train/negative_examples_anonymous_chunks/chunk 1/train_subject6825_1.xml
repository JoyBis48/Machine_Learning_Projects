	<TITLE> Roku Android App </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-11-07 07:27:40 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I've been messing around with the Roku Android app for smart phones for the last few days, and have to say, I'm impressed with some of it and disappointed by other parts.

**The Good**

It works really well. Reaction time actually seems to be faster than the Roku remote.

The app has a neat feature that allows you to view pictures or videos taken with your phone on your TV.

The app lets you stream music on your phone to the TV.

It's free!

**The Bad**

I can't use my phone's keyboard to run a search. To my thinking, this is the biggest and worst limitation of the app. It's ridiculous that I can't use my phone's keyboard to type in a title/director/etc. to run a search, rather having to peck the characters in one-by-one just like with the stock remote.

**The ugly**

When streaming video from my phone to the Roku, the app appears to compress the video quite heavily resulting in a lot of artifacting. This isn't too big of a deal if you're just wanting to show some videos to friends family.

Ocassionally the video will stop to buffer.


Overall, the app is a lot like the Roku itself, in that it does some things very well, but the interface isn't the best and sometimes it goes a bit wonky. That said, I think it's worth installing. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> A Rough Proposal For Colorado Legislators </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-09-12 03:48:55 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Now that Morse and Giron have been recalled, the Colorado Democratic party is probably in momentary internal chaos.

If the Republicans really want to win points, now is the time for them to push through pro-rights legislation, and, frankly, I think they ought to put forth the following proposals:

1.) A repeal of the magazine ban in full.
2.) Repeal the universal background check law, as well as the requirements for background checks to be conducted at gun shows.
3.) Tax incentives designed to bring gun and gun-related companies to the state of Colorado in order to generate jobs and tax revenue, as well as establishing a group of businesses in Colorado with a vested interest in ensuring that gun control cannot get a foot hold in this state. (Magpul was invaluable in their actions to help to reduce the damage of these laws.)
4.) Other proposals that would just simply cause the Democrats to flip out. Not sure what those would be. Maybe legalize hunting with sound suppressors, paying for maintenance and range safety officers at public ranges, or something else I haven't thought of.

Right now the Democrats fundamentally believe that Morse and Giron were recalled because of their stance on guns. It's time for the Republicans to step up, propose some pro-gun laws, and force the rest of the state Democratic party to either back the Republican play or face the consequences. </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2013-08-02 14:21:51 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Several months ago, I randomly stumbled across a blog post where the author tackled the media claims that gun ownership was falling, while at the same time pointing out that the number of NICS checks conducted were at record highs.

The article basically showed that while the percentage of households that owned guns was smaller compared to years past, this was due to the fact that the rate of gun owning households growing at a slower rate than the rate of household growth overall.

The upshot of the article was that, even though fewer households have a gun as an overall percentage in years past, there are still record numbers of gun owners overall.

It was a very insightful analysis, and now, for the life of me, I can't find it again. If anyone else remembers what I'm talking about, or could dig it up for me, I'd be truly grateful.

Thanks. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> The Colorado Universal Background Check Law HB-1229, Discriminates Against Gays. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-02-22 17:13:04 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So, I've just been reading through the proposed universal background check law here in Colorado.

The law outlines a number of exceptions where a transfer can be legally done without having to go through a background check.

Here's the list of exempted transfers straight from the bill:

[QUOTE]3 (b)  EXCEPT AS PROHIBITED BY SECTION 18-12-111, A TRANSFER
4 THAT IS A BONA FIDE GIFT BETWEEN IMMEDIATE FAMILY MEMBERS, WHICH
5 ARE LIMITED TO SPOUSES, PARENTS, CHILDREN, SIBLINGS, GRANDPARENTS,
6 AND GRANDCHILDREN;[/QUOTE]

So, reading through that list of exemptions, it would be legal for me to transfer a gun to my wife for self protection while I'm out of town on a business trip.

However, if a gay man or lesbian were to transfer a gun to his/her partner under the exact same set of circumstances, it would be an illegal transfer without conducting a background check.

Given that the Democratic party has consistently positioned itself as the champion of LGBT issues, I find it highly instructive that they're willing to draw a line of demarcation that essentially says "gay people don't have the same gun right to self defense as straight people."

No matter where you stand on LGBT political issues, no reasonable person would think that such unequal treatment under the law could possibly be fair or just, and regardless of where you personally stand on this issue, the Colorado Democratic party should be called to account for their clearly discriminatory attitude regarding gays and guns.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So, I recently smoked a fairly massive pork loin at a friend's house. This thing is perfectly done. Smokey, tender, and delicious.

I would happily just eat the thing by cutting hunks of it off with a knife, but that somehow doesn't seem civilized, especially since this enormous hunk of delicious meat is going to be my work day lunch for the next week or two.

So, hit me with your best suggestions for fancying this up. I'm already thinking in terms of doing some pulled pork, but also would like ideas about making pork medallions with some kind of paleo sauce.

Or any other suggestions you guys might have. Wrap it in bacon and garnish with an avocado? Served with a side of shrimp and slathered in a coconut and red pepper sauce? Something else I haven't even thought of?

Lay it on me! </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Virginia Tech Review Panel's Assessment of Magazine Bans </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> In the wake of the Sandy Hook shooting, I've been going back and doing some reading on previous spree shootings. One of the documents I'm working my way through is the Virginia Tech Review Panel's Report on the Mass Shootings at Virginia Tech. (You can download the report here:
http://www.governor.virginia.gov/tempcontent/techpanelreport.cfm )


The report is quite comprehensive, covering a history of Seung Hui Cho, his mental problems, Virginia Tech's security protocols at the time of the shooting, a timeline of the shooting, and how Cho acquired his guns.


As you might recall, Cho committed his crimes with a Glock 19 and a Walther P22. He purchased and subsequently used numerous magazines for both guns, including several 15-round magazines for the Glock 19.


On page 87 of the PDF I came across the following bombshell:



The panel also considered whether the previous federal Assault Weapons Act of 1994 that banned 15-round magazines would have made a difference inthe April 16 incidents. The law lapsed after 10 years, in October 2004, and had banned clips or magazines with over 10 rounds. ***The panel concluded that 10-round magazines that were legal would have not made much difference in the incident.*** Even pistols with rapid loaders *(ed. I think they are referring to revolver speed loaders here)* could have been about as deadly in this situation.



So there it is.


In an official 260 page review conducted jointly between the Virginia Governor's office and Virginia Polytechnic Institute, the official stance is that a magazine ban would have made little to no difference in the outcome of the shooting. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> In Defense of High Capacity Magazines </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> In the wake of the Sandy Hook school shooting, there have been calls for reinstating a federal ban on magazines that hold more than ten rounds.

Arguing for the right to own these magazines is something that can be problematic, as even many gun owners see no issue with restricting access to them.

Furthermore, I've seen a lot of pro-gun folks try to make a case for these magazines, and come off as either insensitive, buffoonish, or just downright stupid, and it makes me cringe every time I watch it happen.

So, in the interest of preserving our second amendment rights, here are my thoughts on arguing against bans on 10 round magazines.

**Know Who You're Debating**

Most of the people reacting to Sandy Hook (and other rampage shootings) are not gun people. For the most part, they aren't anti-gun people, either. They are, however, completely ignorant about guns and how they work, and have a general level of fear associated with guns and people who own them.

What they're looking for is an answer to the question of "how do we stop rampage shootings" and they're grabbing at the first straw, gun control, that seems like a good idea. You have to convince them that gun control is not the answer.

**Arguments That Don't Work, and Why**

* It's my right to own them because 2nd Amendment.*
-This argument is true, however it makes you look stupid and selfish. After all, to the people you're speaking to, you come off sounding like you put your right to own a dangerous product above the safety of their kids.

*I own them because I can.*
-Again, this is a stupidly weak argument, and a tautology on top.

*I own them because I may need them for self-defense.*
-Remember, the people you're talking to have not spent any time at all studying personal defense, much less defense with a firearm. By and large, most people assume that a more traditional style of gun, like a revolver, would be perfectly adequate. Furthermore, statistically speaking, for the vast, vast majority of defensive encounters, they're right. The number of self-defense incidents where capacity of the defender's gun was what won the day are, in truth,  vanishingly small. As a result, most people, who've spent no time reading up on the current state of self-defense will dismiss you as a paranoid lunatic with delusions of having to fend off an army.

*I own them because we may need them in case of invasion/the US government turns on its own people/The Revolution/Wolverines!*
-Most people in this country live comfortable lives, and they rarely pay attention to historical precedent. As a result, they don't believe that things could come down to a situation where things go all Warsaw Ghetto, and even if they *do* entertain the notion that such a thing could happen here, they cannot and will not consider the idea of actually picking up a gun and fighting against an existential threat. Any argument that follows the revolutionary line of reasoning will be dismissed out of hand as paranoid fantasizing. You will be painted as a lunatic preparing for an event that will never happen. The assumption is that you're so delusional that you are putting your right to a revolution that will never come up against the protection of children.

*I own them because it makes it easier for me at the shooting range or because having them reduces amount of time I have to waste loading magazines.*
-Again, this argument makes you look completely unsympathetic. After all, if a ban on magazines would reduce these shootings, then who cares if it means you're slightly inconvenienced during a range trip?

*I own them because I compete in USPSA/3 Gun/some other form of competition.*
-This argument can help to counter the "you don't need a high capacity magazine to hunt" or "why would anyone have these things?" and pointing out that you're involved in a competitive sport may confer some legitimacy, but it's still a weak argument, because you sound like you're putting the enjoyment of a game above the safety of kids.

**Arguments That Should Work, With Explanation**

The best way to voice your opposition to a magazine ban isn't by asserting your rights. Regardless of how strongly you feel about the 2nd Amendment, rights-based or possession-based arguments are not going to sway someone who is on the fence about the 2nd Amendment, and/or already believes that no reasonable person owns such an item.

The best way to make the case in favor of 10 round magazines is from a policy perspective. As gun owners we should all be actively engaging in the public discussion over these items, and offering our unique knowledge to help guide policy in a direction that will actually be effective at stopping these sorts of shootings from happening in the future.

***The best arguments against a ban on these magazines is to point out that such a ban SIMPLY WILL NOT WORK.*** It's thoroughly terrible policy that will absolutely not stop the next rampage killer from taking out as many victims as his tortured mental state demands.

Here's a breakdown of the arguments that are bound to be the most effective, at least with people who aren't being completely emotional about the situation.

*The 1994-2004 Assault Weapon Ban*
-The US had a ban on these magazines that lasted for ten years, and during that time, there was not one trustworthy study that showed the ban had any effect whatsoever on rates of violent crime, regardless of the type.

*The technology is already "in the wild."*
-With the exception of the ten years during the federal assault weapon ban 10 round magazines have been sold with hundreds of millions of new guns, and available on the market to anyone who cares to purchase them. These magazines are mechanically simple (about as complex as a well-constructed travel mug), small, and completely untraceable. Any attempt to regulate these magazines will essentially be DOA because there are already so many of them in private hands.

*Consider the implications of enforcing a ban*
-Everyone wants to get behind the idea of a ban without putting any thought into actual enforcement costs. Ask them to explain how they would enforce a ban.
Would they be willing to ok warrantless searches to find these magazines?
Would they be willing to arrest, try, convict, and imprison for ten years anyone found to possess one?
How much would it cost to imprison all of these millions of people?
Would we have to construct new prisons for them?
Would it really be worth it?

(The nice thing about this line of reasoning is that it's an extremely easy litmus test to see if you're dealing with someone who's halfway rational or not. No rational person would actually agree that locking up tens of millions of people who've harmed no one would be a good idea. And if the person says they're ok with it, you know they're a nut. This argument also has the potential to work well if you're talking to people in favor of legalizing pot, as the comparisons between marijuana users and magazine owners are actually pretty clear-cut.)

*How to enforce a ban?*
-How would you keep people from importing unmarked magazines from outside of the US, or squirting them out of a 3D printer?

*Point out that other mass shootings have taken place without 10 round magazines*
-3 of the 4 guns used by the Columbine shooters did not use high capacity magazines. Specifically, Eric Harris had to reload his Hi-Point Carbine ten times, and the double-barreled shotgun used was reloaded over twenty times. [Source]http://acolumbinesite.com/weapon.html The Walther used by Seung-Hui Cho could not hold more than ten rounds. The Beltway "snipers" never fired more than one shot at any given murder attempt. Charles Whitman used no high capacity magazines.

-Changing magazines is an action that even an amateur can easily complete in under four seconds. Even if the killer is limited to ten round magazines, it won't matter. They will simply carry more magazines and reload more often. Furthermore, there is not one instance where that extra reload time made a difference in the outcome of a shooting. (Some may try to claim that it did in the case of the Giffords shooting, but Loughner's gun jammed, which is what provided the time to others around him to react.)


Finally, if you're a parent and a gun owner, voice this fact. Having a kid means you've got skin in the game, and gives you additional legitimacy. Remember, at the end of the day, everyone wants the same thing: to stop or reduce the number of rampage killings, especially those targeting children. As gun owners, we have not only a unique perspective and specialist knowledge on the subject, but we've also got the most to lose. Therefore it is extremely important for all of us to present the best arguments we can.

I hope that this post is useful. I've been making a number of these arguments on public news forums with some success. I'd appreciate any feedback.

Thanks. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So, awhile back, I installed an App on my Kindle Fire called [Peekaboo Barn](http://www.nightanddaystudios.com/app/peekaboo-barn).

My kid goes nuts for this thing, and this got me to wondering if there were other decent apps out there that an infant would like, or would help them to learn something new.

Thanks. </TEXT>
