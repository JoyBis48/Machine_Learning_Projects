	<TEXT> How is it an originalist argument? Again, Hughes used the case that emergencies required an expansion of government, something not found in the Constitution. Justice Black did the same thing when he mentioned in his opinion that war burdened us all, therefore holding up a "valid military order" (instead of making a presumption in favor of liberty, as the Framer's would have made) was justified. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  It allowed the military to place Japanese in camps during WWII.

SCOTUS made the ruling it did on *Korematsu* because it stepped *away* from originalism. Here's what Chief Justice Hughes wrote in his opinion:

"Compulsory exclusion of large groups of citizens from their homes, except under circumstances of direct emergency and peril, is inconsistent with our basic governmental institutions...But when under conditions of modern warfare our shores are threatened by hostile forces, the power to protect must be commensurate with the threatened danger."

If that was true, the Framer's would have added an "emergency" clause somewhere in the Constitution (and they were fresh from being occupied by hostile forces themselves). Had SCOTUS kept to the ideas of the founders and been more strict with Constitutional meaning, *Korematsu* could not have been ruled as it did. If you can explain how this is not the case, I'll gladly listen. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I somewhat discredit the 60s counterculture movement in regards to the topic at hand, the hippies weren't radical gun owners, per say.

No, but they were *massively* disobeying the law. Open drug use, protesting the DNC, rioting, avoiding the draft, numerous violent clashes with law enforcement (Kent State). We have nothing like that currently. Occupy and the Tea Party were steps in some sort of social shift, but Occupy failed to create a means to actually institute change, and the Tea Party fizzled out, becoming engulfed by the GOP. Unlike the various groups of the 60s (Black Panthers, SDS, etc.), neither Occupy or the Tea Party managed to last very long, prolonging the existence of the status quo.

Whatever you may think of the militia groups they a) don't have legislative influence and b) could easily be thwarted by the Feds, if needed (remember Waco?). And they've had plenty of opportunities to take on the Feds in an attempt to enact change (the Bundy standoff would have been a perfect moment to start a 'civil war').

Again, the KKK *literally* wrote laws in the last century (like with mandating students only attend public schools in Oregon, forbidding access to private shools and homeschooling). And do you remember what the second film to ever be shown at the White House was? (I'll give you a hint: Birth of a Nation.) As "ballsy" as these militias might be getting, at the very least, Congress isn't watching their films in some giant studio inside the Capital Building, or sitting next to them while legislation is written.

National and international tensions are pretty tight.

Can you name me a time, since the country's founding, when they *weren't* tight? Things were so bad in the past, we came several instances close to nuclear war (Cuban Missile Crisis/Soviet occupation of Czechoslovakia). Currently, we're not at the point (though *conventional* war with Russia *could* be a possibility, depending on whether or not Putin decides to occupy a NATO country). 

Not to mention, public approval for both president and congress are at all time lows. People understand that their government no longer serves their interests anymore.

People's approval of Congress is indeed low, but for their own Congressman, it's pretty normal. People blame the *other guy*, and not their own representative. 

The point is, in context, things are indeed bad, a little bit better then they once were (what with the whole "separate but equal" thing gone), but still bad. People recognize this (Occupy and the Tea Party again being examples of people trying to distance themselves from the status quo), but we've yet to really get anywhere necessary in order for their to be massive change.

Many anarchists of course don't vote, but who gets how many votes in elections is still an important indicator of which direction our country wants to head in. Last election, Jill Stein, Gary Johnson, Virgil Goode, and other contenders for the presidency got *squat*. People are mad, like you said, but they're not doing anything different than what they have been for the past few decades.

	<TEXT>  But has there been civil unrest on the level that we see today? No.

Yes there has been. The events leading up to the American Revolution (and the Revolution itself) and the 1960s had actual riots and huge movements disobeying the law. People were massively avoiding taxes in the former, and fleeing the country (due to the draft) during the latter (and also avoiding taxes, in the case of Quakers and other religious pacifists). Then there was of course the Civil War, in which half of the country disobeyed the other half.

That's not to say there isn't an undercurrent of disobedience to the status quo (which is why figures like Bernie Sanders and Ron Paul are so popular), but, for the moment, it pales in comparison to previous social movements.

I agree a shift in social understanding of government is coming, but it will most likely be one in which government stays in place.

Edit: Also...

Coming from the right wingers here in the U.S. militias are expanding, and they're becoming more pronounced and are even flexing their existence on social media outlets and in public.

You forget the KKK had actual legislative influence in this country at one point. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I could understand that, but libertarian positions are so misunderstood and underrepresented in the political realm that if the movement is to gain any sort of traction then it needs someone who can convince people to completely change their way of thinking when it comes to the philosophy of government. At best, the majority of people who will vote for Johnson will do so because they *already* agree with him. That's not really enough to inspire a "Ross Perot/Ralph Nader" type moment where he could act as a spoiler in the election (or even possibly win).

I try to imagine him debating Obama in the presidential debates last election, and just can't see him winning. 

But you are right - he doesn't pretend to be something he isn't, which is pretty nice for a politician.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I hope the LP chooses someone more articulate than him for President. I don't mind his positions, and agree with a fair portion, but he's not good at elaborating why libertarian policies would be the best thing for the country. I found his book *Seven Principals of Good Government* to be horribly dull, compared to the works of Ron Paul. And all of his speeches similarly lack real substance.

Good luck to him, but here's hoping someone better gets the spotlight. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The University of Delaware had the exact same program described in the article a couple years ago, and the exact same thing happened when minority students objected to being labeled "oppressed". They were told they were wrong, and that they were indeed "oppressed" even if they didn't feel like it.

It gets worse. At UoD, Resident Assistants asked for students to sexually identify themselves, and said request was *mandatory*. Here's an excerpt from FIRE President Greg Lukianoff's book Unlearning Liberty, 
describing the program:

 The program included an aggressive series of mandatory floor meetings where students would engage in exercises. In one such activity, they had to stand along a wall if they supported various social causes, including the right to gay marriage or abortion, and along the other wall if they didn't. Students were not allowed to say they hadn't made up their minds-it was explained to them that in the real world there is no middle ground. (I wonder how proponents of the "No Labels" movement would feel about that claim.) One student reportedly asked to be excused from the activity when the choice was whether eating disorders were caused by society or by the person's own mental state. Her request was denied; she was forced to pick a side even after revealing that she had struggled with an eating disorder and had not yet made up her mind. This event functioned as a state-sponsored public shaming of students with 'wrong' beliefs.
 
 ...
 
 The mandatory 'one on one' sessions with the RAs were, to me, the creepiest aspect of the whole program. During the sessions, students were asked to fill out surveys while an RA watched. Here is a sampling of some of the questions:
 
 [2]. Would you be comfortable being close friends with any of the follow persons? Mark YES or NO
 
 African American/Black... Y N
 
 A heterosexual man... Y N
 
 An international student... Y N
 
 An openly gay or bisexual woman... Y N
 
 [3]. Would you be comfortable dating any of the following persons? (Assume you are single)
 
 Middle Eastern... Y N
 
 A heterosexual woman... Y N
 
 A person with different religious beliefs than yours... Y N
 
 An openly gay or bisexual man... Y N
 
 ...
 
 In five hundred pages of documentation, there was only one clear example of a student who resisted these bizarre invasions of privacy. According to a report from her RA, this girl had fun with one of the questionnaires, answering the question "When was a time you felt oppressed?" by saying "I am oppressed every day [because of my] feelings for the opera. Regularly [people] throw stones at me and jeer me with cruel names...Unbearable adversity. But I will overcome, hear me, you rock throwing majority." The female freshman--apparently alone in her male RA's dorm room--had the guts to deflect such a creepy questionnaire through humor. But when the questionnaire asked "What is your sexual identity?" she responded, "That is none of your damn business."
 
 For challenging an unlawful intrusion into her private life by a state employee, this student was listed by name and room number in the report as one of the "worst" examples of students resisting the program (yes it does start to sound a bit like the Borg), and the resident assistant even noted that he had filed an incident report against *her*. It would not surprise me if the student had been found guilty of harassing the RA. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Various Presidents have packed the courts to support policy. There was the New Deal court, and then later on the Rehnquist court under Reagan. There are times when this works in the favor of these administrations, and times it works against. Judges are not often as predictable as we might think, and will rule outside the philosophy of their appointer on occasion. 

That said, the Rehnquist court had several good rulings which resulted in favor of the people where government was in the wrong (*Texas v. Johnson*, for example). We should not be so quick to decry an originalist SCOTUS.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> But, like the author said, we don't really *know* who is running. We can make presumptions about her platforms, but that's all, due to her (purposeful?) quietness on issues. What's remarkable is that she has been in the spotlight ever since her husband took office, yet despite that, we don't have a clear image of her politics. One would think that over such a grand amount of time, a certain figure would begin to take shape, yet it hasn't, at least not to your average American voter.

Sure, we can presume she won't agree with the GOP on various issues, but even that doesn't tell us much about what she hopes to run on. Like the author said, her closeness to Wall St. is a little troubling, and could very well be a factor into what positions she holds as a contestant. Or maybe it won't. We'll have to see. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I asked two questions about the current status of the Beijing-Pyongyang relationship to the writers of The Diplomat during their /r/geopolitics AMA. Here's the correspondence: 

*Q: Last year China stopped repatriating North Korean escapees. What does this signal, if anything, of the current relationship between Beijing and Pyongyang?*

/u/RobertFarley_AMA: There are plenty of indications that the relationship between Beijing and Pyongyang has grown tense in spots. The situation is complex; plenty of Chinese officials seem to feel some sense of obligation to North Korea, and there's a generalized sympathy with respect to shared anti-American and anti-Japanese attitudes. But North Korea also remains an expensive client for Beijing, with the potential to disrupt its emerging trade and political relationship with South Korea. 

With respect to the escapees specifically, it's an administrative and economic pain to have to sort through the North Korean expat community in Manchuria and hunt down the ones that North Korea wants back. I'm actually not sure how much the Chinese have slowed this down; accounts seem to differ. But forced repatriation was certainly proving to be a growing embarrassment for Beijing, and perhaps one that the CCP wasn't willing to endure.

*Q: All of that being said, where do you see the China-North Korea relationship going in the next ten years?*

/u/ChenDingding_AMA: China, under president Xi Jinping, has already adopted a tough approach toward North Korea mainly because NK's behaviors are now hurting China's national interests. This trend will continue for the next ten years; but China will not allow NK to collapse.

I dunno man, you seem out of the loop in more ways than one. You know what dickbutt is, and I think you have as good an idea of its background as any of us (I assume it started as a 4chan thing, and it frequently appears as a visual reveal-punchline in GIFs. I'm not sure how much more there is to it.)

But why is it funny? I dunno, you could ask that question about any motif in the world like this that people tend to find humorous. It's funny cause it's unexpected, it's funny cause it's juvenile, it's funny in a "I should have seen that coming" kind of way. 

But if it doesn't tickle you for any of the above reasons? Then you just don't find it funny. Case closed. It doesn't make you out of the loop. It just means you don't get it/it doesn't resonate with you, depending on your perspective.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Anarchist reporting in (specifically an anarcho-pacifist). You're asking why anarchism draws in communists and other state socialist types, yes? As in, why would a supporter of the Communist Party of [Country] turn towards anarchism?

Well, such people (communist and socialist statists) are all already against the hierarchy of capitalism (the boss vs. worker relationship). Many take logical steps to then say if one imposed hierarchy is bad, then so are others, namely, government and the imposition of law via violent means (police and courtS).

In fact, to many communists and Marxist academics, anarchy is the final form of communism. That is to say, a communist state should eventually dissolve itself into various anarchist communities. 

As for the label of liberal, well, to many anarchists, any supporter of capitalism is actually a liberal (AnCaps excluded due to their different views).    </TEXT>

The good majority of jobs I found were call centers, blue caller work (like mechanics and the like), and a couple software jobs. And driving down a couple streets in places like Sandy, you can see a whole lot of "For Hire" signs at gas stations and fast food joints.

	<TEXT> I wonder what she would do about ISIS if they appeared after the death of McCain. My best is that she would take whatever advice generals gave her (which probably wouldn't be too different from what Obama gets today), but at the same time, I wonder if Republicans would be more open to having boots on the ground with a fellow conservative in the White House, and if so, how would she react? 

My big concern would be her foreign policy towards Asia (specifically China). We've seen Obama and his administration organizing the Asia pivot, but I'm unsure if Palin would follow that same direction. Would she be more openly hostile towards Chinese military aggressions? Probably.  And if so, this would cause a lot of problems. 

But like others have said, age would probably have a good cabinet set up by McCain to rely on.  </TEXT>
