	<TEXT> The problem with this strategy is that it can be interpreted as sexual, and there's an increasing amount of opposition in society to heterosexual men being open about sexual matters and a general tendency to demonise men and sex.

There is already a fairly strong pro foreskin movement within the gay community and that seems to work ok, and it would also work for women to express their desire and attraction for men with a natural penis. However, different rules apply to most men it can be slightly risky to celebrate the foreskin too much. Obviously it's nothing like the same as circumfetishists who gets their kicks out of mutilating kids, but clearly the best strategy is to attack such child abusers.

To be honest there's nothing to celebrate about having a foreksin becasue that's just normal isn't it and how things are meant to be? We don't celebrate having legs or arms do we? </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  But given that national GDP changes were factored into the Australian study

Yes but is that simply GDP or GDP per capita? Under the Tories GDP has risen but only becasue they keep immigration at or near to Labour's previously huge levels, the average person is no better off. Furthermore, men are often left behind and on the scrap heap even during a recovery, so even though most people might be getting richer they could still be suffering in silence. For example labour decimated manufacturing in this country through mis-rule and closed down male industries such as mining. Thatcher continued with some of the closures and didn't' exactly help matters, but ultimately it was Labour who did a lot of the damage.

Ultimately, suicide is now mostly a male issue and all the Tories are pretty bad, it's still the case that the most anti-male agenda comes from Labour (and similar parties elsewhere in the world). We could cut suicide massively if we dealt with the awful family courts, actaully helped the 40% of domestic violence victims who are men, dealt with the sexist justice and prison system, introduced shared parenting and actually took men's health seriously. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I didn't read it in full, though one issue is that many suicides are a result of years of depression and long term factors such a failed relationships, unemployment. So for examples, someone would have lost their job and their house etc under the crash of the economy under Labour, though the associated depression wouldn't have resulted in their actual suicide until the coaltion were in power.

Also, I know for a fact that certain departments at the University of Bristol have some absolutely vile people with the most extreme views on issues and as a result I wouldn't trust half the research associated with that particular University (and I'd go so far as to assuming the exact opposite was true in many cases). </TEXT>

I've seen both tweets in question and also sent an email myself. The only "threatening" aspect is that they "threaten" to report the company if it doesn't comply with the law. They really are pathetic and childish, why not just reply politely/professioanlly and at least promise to investigate? And I've seen some pretty lame claims of a "cyber attack" before but this has top top the lot. Since when does a few people either lemaling, tweeting or posting a review constitute such a thing?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If it's hard to choose between two parties then try to examine the two candidates that are standing in your area and investigate which one has the most egalitarian values.

It's pretty easy to spot man hating feminists and their friends if you look into people's backgrounds. And if you've got a particularly nasty feminists in with a chance of winning then a vote for anyone standing against them counts as progress. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This J4M B fund-raiser represents great value for money activism so please get involved if you can.

The way UK electoral system works is that each party gets one leaflet delivered free of charge by the Royal Mail wherever they are standing. Therefore donors only need fund the printing cost and then the leaflet gets delivered **free of charge.**

Given that the cost of postage on the UK equates to about 53 pence (80 cents), **you're basically getting $9 worth of services for every dollar you give!**

I'd challenge anyone to find a better value way of donating to men's human rights causes right now.

Donation are accepted from abroad as long as they are less than 5,000

Here's an article with further info:

	<TEXT> Actually his would be pretty damn good if it included gender.  It gives excelletnt results if we include this or assume gender to be a culture. 

1. No. I cannot mostly be with other males at college/university as higher education classes are now female dominated across the western world.

2. No. Young women earn more than young men and many adverts for renting accommodation explicitly ban males, thus making it hard to access housing.

3. No. As a male, I'm far more likely to face violence than females, someone of this is likely to be by those living in my street.

4. Yes, though there are attempts by some to reduce the protein I need to consume to remain healthy.

5. No. men are demonised in the media, regularly stereotyped either as idiots, incapable parents, or as violent and abusive.

6. No. All the world's problems tend to be blamed on men, usually white men.

7. Strange question.

8. Yes, but the gaming industry is already under attack and music seems to be the next target so probably not safe for much longer.

9. This doesn't' happen to any group that I'm aware of, though in some places men are often punished becasue of their gender when buying car insurance

10. I don't have any "borthers", but whatever they are I'm sure that as a male  I'm burdened with protecting them and putting myself in harms way to do so.

11. If I use curse words it will probably be considered abusive or threatening behaviour becasue of my gender.

12. The justice system is known to discriminate against all males on a mass scale and to a huge extent. Any discrimination against ethnic minorities by the justice system is completely dwarfed by the scale of discrimination on the ground of gender. Were I a female doing so I'd simply be considered "empowered".

13. Happens to both men and women, though actually probably more so women.

14. Happens all the time. "Teach men not to rape" even a state sponsored "men can stop rape" campaign. Why am I supposed to stop men and women raping each other simply becasue of my gender?

15. Depends. Certainty not in many schools, nor in a lot of taxpayer funded institutions.

16. One domestic violence shelter for men in the whole of Canada despite half of victim being men, and will probably be arrested instead of the perpetrator if I call the police as a victim of domestic violence. Widespread discrimination in medical research against males (e.g. cancer). And if I'm on a sinking ship I'll be the last to be rescued! </TEXT>

Well I agree your point apples to a lot of feminists and a lot of users of the block bots, but some people will be duped into using these block lists thinking they are genuine tools to block offensive users when they're actually 100% political.

Hearing well-argued and logical dissenting views really is a useful thing and of course there's the Twitter block function for dealing with very isolated incidents of harassment and blatant trolls. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> True, though surely any sane person would want to use a bot that operates as described, and actually blocks sexism and hate, and these bots just don't do that.

They certainly claim be about helping people avoid some of the nastier accounts on Twitter, yet in reality many of those on the list are simply there becasue they dared to disagree or even question a particular aspect of extremist feminism.

The bots aren't about making the twitter experience any more pleasant or safer for Twitter users, they're simply political tools used to silence dissent and simply make Twitter into an echo chamber for those using them. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> At the very least, if they really must publish hate speech then they need to name the author.

Pretty cowardly of them not to give their name, and it's also despicable for the newspaper to grant anonymity to a writer for no other reason that the fact that their comments are hateful and possibly illegal. At the very least they would surely end up being fired by their employer or kicked out of whatever university they attend. </TEXT>

I wonder if we could all counter this by actually finding people subject to blocks and all following them thus making the entire scheme backfire? I'm a little late to the party with regard to the block-bot story so perhaps there's already something like this in place that I'm unaware of? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is as much about the Lib Dems as it is about feminism (if not more so).

There were clearly countless man hating feminists in attendance at NUS Women 2015 (probably more than almost anywhere else in the country). These misandrist feminists will always exist and I guess they're entitled to get together and do whatever they want. However, if people want to get involved with such extremism and actually express such vile views about half the population then there should be no place for them in the Lib Dems and they certainly should have roles on no less than 3 Lib Dem exec committees.

Ultimately, if Lib Dem exec members go out of their way to spread hatred against half the electorate than how do they ever expect to win any seats? They might pick up the self-loathing male vote, though tbh Labour and the Greens already pretty much have that tiny section of the electorate to themselves already. </TEXT>

And I'm not spreading any harassment campaign - she's the one promoting removing men form society and putting men in the bin. Her actions are clearly newsworthy and if she didn't' want to be in the headlines then she should keep spreading hatred on Twitter while occupying multiple executive positions in a major political party. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The violence and fire alarm pulling in Toronto involved large numbers of people, many feminists were involved and they even recruited trade union officials to support what they did. The criminal acts and obscene harassment happened repeatedly at least 4 separate men's issues evens over the space of more than a year. You can watch video of every single incident on Youtube

For the details on feminists supporting female paedophiles read about what happened too Michelle Elliot, who pioneered research into this area (she founded Kidscape too). There's a video interview of Michelle on youtube which is essential viewing, though the main channel has been taken down so I'd need to find you a mirror. edit- i found it https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzC6OfPj82I

Your point about men getting custody when they "ask" for it is meaningless. Most know they have zero chance and thus are advised not to even bother trying in court and wasting huge sums of moeny. Rich men get custody and those where the mother is clearly unfit - that's about it.

Here's a source for a feminist organisation doubting that fasle rape allegations even exist:
http://therightsofman.typepad.co.uk/the_rights_of_man/2010/02/does-the-moon-really-exist.html

Your final point sis wrong in the US, particularly colleges, who have now officially switched to a preponderance of evidence weighting for rape allegations thanks to feminists:

Try to organise a talk on male suicide by Warren Farrell and feminists will blockade the event, use violence and scream abuse at attendees and pull fire alarms risking everyone's safety.

Try to organise a conference on female paedophiles (who typically abuse boys) and feminists will protest it.

Try to point out that 40% of dv victims are men and they need shelters, feminists will lie and agree and oppose funding for such facilities.

Feminist organisations openly campaign against shared parenting, and campaign for women to have custody of children. They deny that false rape accusations even exist (thus meaning all the male victims of false rape allegations who comitt suicide therefore don't really exist). They hijacked the domestic violence shelters in this country for political purposes and forced the pro-equality founder out of her own organisation becasue she dared to not that a lot of the women in the shelters were also pretty violent and abusive themselves and therefore dv wasn't a gender issue.

Feminists are even attakcing men in the justice system, removing even the most fundamental of rights such as the concept of innocece before proven guilty.

I'm not saying their aren't other obstacles to equality for males, and the more conservative/macho attitude of some doesn't' help. However, it's feminists that are now by far the strongest, most vocal, most committed and most successful opponents of the human rights of men. </TEXT>
