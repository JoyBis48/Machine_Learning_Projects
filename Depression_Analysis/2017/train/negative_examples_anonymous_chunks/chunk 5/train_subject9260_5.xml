Sure, family is more likely to be helpful. I can crash with my dad if I need a place, and can count on my mom for help... But my roommate has already proven he won't help me if it doesn't benefit him directly, including being more likely to buy drugs than pay the rent.

My coworkers will skive off work, leaving me to deal with it all or work overtime.

My boss doesn't understand that prices and rent have gone up, but at least they'll let me get advances on my paycheck (which basically means I am stuck working for them).

What's worse is that? I can't even drop everything and disappear. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't know about the first question, but maybe.

As for the rest, it wasn't a full redemption. She had to pay half the room rent each night (give or take) on her own card, but apparently the card they originally used was marked Lost, making it invalid.

I certainly understand the frustration they had, but it wasn't something we could just sit on for an indefinite period of time. I actually gave them longer than I gave the other two declinations. But we were already having to turn people away at that time.

From our standpoint, we easily could have resold the room, waiting until 11pm to cancel, but there would be (and I'm only exaggerating a little here) 100 renters we *could* have taken in instead of the person with the bad card. But our policy is simply that if your payment is not valid, we cancel your room. Because otherwise, we will get people making reservations with bad credit cards because (a) they don't have to wait for a return on the authorization and (b) they can avoid paying a no-show charge if they decide not to come in after all. </TEXT>

You borrowed the money, ran up the bill, or used a service, and didn't pay for it. You know that you did it, and you don't want to or can not pay.

Because roughly half of the debts bought by debt collectors are not documented properly, especially after it has gone through multiple collection agencies, it is a simple process to *say* you don't recognize it and demand proof. If they give proof, they can't accuse you of lying (many people forget about the doctor visit from 4 years ago) and you can work with them to get back on track, including making a pay to delete arraignment. If they can't give proof, it disappears... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Summer weekend in a beach town means a full house.

We went through the arrivals today, as is tradition, and preauthorized the credit cards on file. One of the few reservations to decline was a Brand Loyalty Partial Payment room.

After confirming that we are allowed to cancel, I called the guest and left a message about the room. It was about 8:30, but we were already having to turn people away who wanted to pay properly for the room. I gave them until 9:30 to update their payment, or it will be canceled.

9:30 passes without contact, and I cancel the room as promised. The room is almost immediately rebooked by a new guest.

10:10, we finally get a call back from the guest, a sweet old lady who sadly was brought to tears that I had to give away the room, but she seemed to understand the situation.... Then she called her son, Fezzik.

The conversation was a little too long for a post here, but suffice it to say every sentence out of his mouth was about my incompetence.

I let it slide for a while, telling him what happened. No, sir, we don't attempt the card until the day of arrival because we don't want an issue with voluntary cancellations. No, sir, we can't hold an invalid reservation indefinitely. No, sir, we don't have another room of that type of give. (We only had singles for the multiple days).

Incompetence, incompetence, incompetence. Every answer I gave as to why we can't simply rebook the room as it was an excuse to hide my incompetence.

I finally broke. "Sir, you keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means."

Obviously, that didn't help at all, but it was so satisfying. I calmed down a bit after.

We traded question and answer like this for a good 10 minutes, and I was getting more agitated because I was constantly repeating myself and trying to deal with other phone calls and guests who I could help.

I finally told him flat out, "the only incompetence here is your own. We trusted that you gave us a valid card, we contacted you as soon as we knew it declined, and we gave you time to fix the problem. If you have any *new* questions, I'll try to answer, but otherwise I'm going to hang up now."

As soon as the word incompetence came from his lips again, it didn't take long, I released the call. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I used to work for Verizon, and while those terms were the justification at that time, +-10 years ago, the reality was that it didn't matter which phone you got (or even if you got a phone at all), or when you cancelled the contract, the ETF was $250.

Our standard practice if you called in during the last month of service was to tell you to wait until the day after the contract expires to cancel  (which usually means we've charged your card for another month and you have to wait to be refunded the difference. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For Junk Debt Buyers, the business is a numbers game. They *know* that most people are not going to pay in full, and many people will either refuse to pay or find a loophole to get out of the debt.

So, they get lax on the paperwork.

The more your debt is, and the more profit it stands to make them, the more likely they will have the appropriate paperwork.

If you owe some company $100, you can probably get it thrown out. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Okay. The connection between Star Trek and Seinfeld goes through the John Larroquette Show.

Star Trek and JL both reference the fictional company Yoyodyne (Not necessarily canon). JL crossed over into Frasier (Canon), which crossed into Caroline in the City, to Friends, to Mad about You, to Seinfeld.

Happy Days is only connected to Friends directly through St. Elsewhere, through a very long connection that I won't spell out.

The problem with the theory is in the fact that many of there "crossovers" are really just two completely different shows referencing the exact same fictional company (like the Star Trek example above), and aren't really in the same universe. Plus the fact that some of the crossovers are specifically alternate universes or TV shows within the TV show, or silly non-canon appearences, like the famous John Munch on Sesame Street.

It's an interesting example of how TV shows connect with each other, but it isn't exactly canonized. </TEXT>

On the other hand, the payout can be automated to not require mediation. The two players come back to the app, and it simply asks "who lost?" The loser presses that button, releasing the funds.

If they have a game in progress (neither player presses that they lost) for a certain period of time after the end of the game, then the game is simply cancelled, and both players are refunded. The game gets marked as abandoned, and used as a player ranking (using a percentage of completed games).

If you see someone with a low completion ranking, you decline to take their bets. </TEXT>

We know that the subverse was banned. We know basically why it was banned. The only question that requires "proof" is whether *this girl* was the one being posted.

	<TEXT> It is a valid argument, for one simple reason.

If you try and stop me from commenting because I *could* post a link to child porn, then you are in the wrong.

If you try and stop me from commenting because I *actually* post a link to child porn, then you are taking a correct action.

Removing free speech and expression because of a hypothetical is never appropriate.

How does this factor into your question?

You postulated that they only removed your link, and the subverse that it was posted on, because of what it means to their bottom line, and not because of any moral reason. And again, I ask... Isn't that enough?

If they start banning people for *moral* reasons, then we'll start seeing bans of unpopular subjects like /v/atheism, /v/christianity, /v/politics, /v/libertarianism, or other subs that one person or another finds objectionable.

By only banning people when it becomes *legally necessary*, they protect persons like yourself while allowing the average, law-abiding user to spout out whatever shit they want. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> James and Lily were married for over a year, as were the Longbottoms.

If (and I emphasize the if) Marlene was born a McKinnon, and married in the incredibly short time between the picture being taken and her death, it stands to reason that her marriage might not have been common knowledge.

If she was already married to a non-Order member, then she wasn't a McKinnon in school. (Yes, she technically could have been one, but the odds of such a pairing are incredibly low, even in a close community like the Wizarding World).

If she was never married at all, then the family that was killed was likely her parents.

But, the Order itself was a very tight group. It is highly unlikely that a wife would be in the Order without her husband (Moody goes through a number of couples in the photograph), so the assumption is that she is not married, since a husband was never married.

Now, there is another possibility that hasn't been mentioned yet...

Marlene may have been gay. We know that Rowling intended for some characters to be homosexual, and an unmarried woman in a fighting position may not have married because one woman can not marry another (We never see such a marriage at least.). In this scenario, Moody would have respected her as a person and comrade-in-arms, but not been comfortable talking about such matters with others.

Which one is right? Only JK Rowling knows for sure.  </TEXT>

Unless there was additional info in Pottermore, the books never mention her husband by name. Marlene was standing alone in the picture of the Order.

	<TEXT> I think the problem that these authors have is the fact that we don't know a lot about the people that went to school with the Marauders.

So, authors latch onto any little detail they can find and figure out a way to include it.

Lily's best friend in Hogwarts, at the very beginning, was almost certainly Severus. They knew each other before school for years, and were all but destined to be together... until they were Sorted.

With Lily in a different House, she would have made new friends with her fellow First Years, and quickly gained a closeness associated with "best friends", but she didn't drop Severus until he called her a Mudblood.

Assuming Marlene was the same year and House as her, she could have been one of her closest female friends, explaining why she cried when she heard the news, but it wasn't the same level of closeness that she once had with Severus or grew to have with the Marauders.

Thus, Lily's best friend was Severus, and when that friendship died she eventually latched onto the Marauders directly, becoming close enough with them to trust Wormtail and Sirius with her protection just as much as James did. </TEXT>

I don't have a problem with them choosing Miles Morales to be the MCU Spider-Man. It would be a *great* way to differentiate the character from the Sony Pictures Spider-Man and Amazing Spider-Man.

I also understand the reasoning behind using Peter Parker for the specific role, because of the back story and the overall effect of him revealing his identity during Civil War.

On the broader sense, if you want to see a new powerful black hero, make a new one (like the new Ms. Marvel). Or take an older one and make him into a more powerful character (like the MCU Falcon). But don't change the race of existing characters and pretending it doesn't change their history. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes, but the money has to come from somewhere.

AC makes (let's say) $5,000,000. They take $1,000,000 of that and put it to develop a new AC game. They then take another $1,000,000 and start developing a new IP, like Watch_Dogs, which may or may not profit.

If WD makes enough, they will do the same thing, take some of the profits and make WD2, and some to make a third game. If it doesn't, then they abandon the IP and just work on the third. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> But we are talking about 15 ships equaling all car emissions in the world. Even if Hummers combined was a significant portion of the car side, it would be peanuts compared to the ship emissions.

Cutting the ship emissions by 5% would do better than cutting Hummer emissions by 50%.

Obviously, the headline is ignoring that it is different kinds of emissions, I understand that, and my initial joking comment was not meant to address that issue. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If they simply return it, let's say they got it in their hands and decided they didn't like it, then it rarely hurts you to allow the refund. You may want to grant only the partial refund to cover your shipping costs (call it a restocking fee), and you can sell it again. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Okay. In regards to legality, making a print of a character has a few things you have to watch for.

First and foremost, is transformation. If you are simply copying an iconic Wolverine comic book cover, then you are violating both trademark and copyright laws. You didn't design the piece, you didn't design the character. It isn't yours to sell.

Second, is replicability. The more easily replicated the artwork, the less likely it will be sued over. You try to sell scribbled drawings of Wolverine on paper, and you'll probably be hit with a C D. You make one 10 foot tall sculpture, and you probably will be congratulated by the artist (unless you piss him off).

That leads into the third point, flattery. If you make said sculpture with Wolverine being raped by Kitty Pryde, they'll come onto you like a hobo on a ham sandwich. If the sculpture depicts him in his iconic crouching pose with blades extended, they will look at it more favorably.

Fourth, and maybe the most important, is competitiveness. If you make a comic book featuring their character, then you are potentially cutting into their profits. Changes you make to the character can erroneously be seen as endorsed by the creators, which leads to problems. The aforementioned 10 foot tall statue, on the other hand, doesn't compete with their property. The people that would buy such a thing will probably be buying the legit art, too.

Now then, Etsy is in a strange position. They don't make anything, except the website. However, enough people are on it that they have to tread extra carefully to avoid C D letters from the property owners.

Because of the points I laid out before, most companies are okay with the creation of fan art. They even encourage it. But if too much goes on in a site like Etsy, Marvel may come down on them.

In response to your question, superhero *posters* would be a definite infringement based on competitiveness. If you wish to fight a C D for your work, you would likely lose, due to the fact that Marvel and DC sell their own posters of characters.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Okay... refund policies for artwork are a very touchy subject.

You should ensure your product is packed well, giving extra space in case of box damage etc.

If you do that, you can have your refund policy be on a case by case basis. Officially, you list no refunds. Then, if someone contacts you and asks for a refund for a reason you don't think is valid (for example, if they call you a few days after getting the package, saying it was damaged in transit), you can simply say "no refunds". The rare case where they show you that something horrible happened, you can grant an exception.

After all, you are the owner of your "business". </TEXT>
