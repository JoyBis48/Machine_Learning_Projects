	<TEXT> Discussions when it comes out and news articles right away i have no problem with. Like i said, its all of the specific questions, b-roll footage, and very specific news articles that are coming out now and that get posted and reposted. There have been more posts about Mad Max that should be on that specific subreddit than any other movie to come out since ive been on reddit. Even more than Marvel movies.

I understand where you are coming from. And to be very technically correct, you are right. But prequel is a modern term used for all movies these days and by that definition, Phantom Menace is a prequel not a sequel. I don't care that much, I only said it because I made one comment about a chronological 4th movie and you came at me about it not being a sequel. I know that. That is obvious. 

As for my original post, I'm not saying it is a good joke, clearly because people are downvoting me for it, but nevertheless was my intention and I think that was clear to most people that I didn't actually think it's a sequel. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It was entertaining and the Cinematography was great. But it was one long action sequence with little story, little character development, and a lot of weirdness to the universe. The action sequences were cool but became repetitive and they are being praised as a return for practical effects when tons of movies have begun to do that in recent years but just haven't shined a light on it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yea, and the production code is 303 because it was filmed out of order. That's the reason for the dialogue too </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Those are some funny movies. I'm not saying Entourage is the king of comedy, it's not even close to my favorite show. But it's entertaining and actually does have some good writing especially in season 5. There was just no reason to troll on something you dislike when it's a thread for people who like it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sorry, it's not your thing bro. Have fun trolling bro. Don't know what the hell you are talking about with the advertising bro. I'm also not OP bro. I've already seen the movie bro. I'd be curious to hear what you consider good comedy bro? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Did you actually sit down and watch episodes and follow the storyline with an open mind.
Or did you half pay attention with your mind already set that they were douches? 

If you don't like it, that's fine. Comedy is subjective, but no need to troll on a thread about a show/movie you clearly hate with a passion.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You clearly never watched the show then. Yes, the show does include the party lifestyle of a good looking Hollywood actor and his buddies. But to generalize that as the entirety of the show is moronic. Especially not having seen it. You also need to keep it mind it's a comedy show with drama interwoven. Not just a drama show. 

Let me put it this way, I think The Big Bang Theory is the worst show on television, but I had the sense and respect enough to watch episodes of it here and there to gauge my opinion on the show. I go in with an open mind and come out still not liking it, but at least I give it an honest shot.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yea, Old Republic would also be very cool. The numbering would reset because it would be a new series. But it would be like Star Wars Anthology and have another name. Terrible example here but something similar to "Star Wars Eternity: Episode I". Again, terrible title I know, but you get the idea </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Did you ever watch the show or are you just making assumptions on the random footage you've seen or because other people hate on it? Yes, the characters are your typical loud new York guys and Hollywood stars but the show in the early years was actually very interesting and by season 5, it had some really great story. 

Plus, your username is "Coloradobro" and you call us tools bro? Not cool bro.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Reboot is not the best word. But what I meant is for basically a continuation but a brand new series. It wouldn't rewrite anything, it just would be completely new characters decades after the originals and sequels. I think it could be a great way to continue without messing with the other movies or trying to redo them </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They are at different Parks because that was the only two spaces available for such a large construction and Diagon Alley was constructed over a year after Hogsmeade had opened. Is it also genius business-wise? Yes. But if you do your homework before buying tickets (I know you didn't have a choice) then it's pretty clear. I bought the park to park pass last time I was there and it was incredible.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think they will reboot the series but not in the usual fashion of rebooting. It will take place in the same universe as 1-9 but start the numbering over with a brand new story, all new characters, and maybe decades beyond the Skywalker family story.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There are a ton of cameos but the movie, as opposed to the trailers, handles them on a much smaller level. Most of them are quick some have larger parts in the movie. 

As for the storyline, it's like you described, which happens all the time in Hollywood but it's really interesting. Especially with Ari </TEXT>

It's better than the last few seasons. It's not perfect but it's very entertaining and has a pretty good story. It's back to the best part of the show, the behind the scenes of making movies in Hollywood. People will be happy to know it's very Ari centric as well which is great </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've said it before in a similar thread but I'd like to see just another random episode. Not elevated at all. No finale vibe. Just another day with the Gang. The end of the episode would be Mac busting into Paddy's yelling "Guys Guys Guys! I've got news!" cut to black and it does the usually title card (12PM. On a Tuesday. It's Always Sunny...) all while Mac and the Gang are talking about the next plan. I like to imagine the Gang just continues their schemes after we leave them.  </TEXT>
