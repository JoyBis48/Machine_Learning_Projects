	<TEXT> I have not visited anyone about hypnosis yet, it is something I am seriously considering tho. And I don't recall 'grabbing a knife', I don't. No recollection, none. I only discovered that after the fact. My friend and I were at a Mormon College in Idaho. (byu-i). I did not have any marks, bruises, cuts, contusions, or anything that would suggest I physically fended off anyone with an intent to harm me or my roommate. We did have activity that we heard both in the apt and in our room. I personally saw a thick, white mist in the hallway billowing towards me at one point. As the only door and all the windows were locked and we were absolutely certain we were alone, we believe it was something else.
Whatever it was moved plenty of furniture, opened cabinets, moved silverware, and certainly scared the living shit out of me and my friend. I do think that I may have blocked it b/c of sheer terror and fear, but what could be more scary than what I'd already experienced? Why when we said a prayer did we see a black shadow move across the wall, and the activity stop for about fifteen minutes, enough time so that we started laughing about how weird and creepy that was only to hear grinding/dragging noises in the kitchen as we had originally heard? (that sound, btw, was chairs being dragged thru the kitchen, dining room, and into the living room, so it happened twice.) It was when we said something my Mother had told me to say in the presence of demons (In the name of Jesus Christ I command you to leave!) that is when everything just goes dark. Literally like a curtain being put over my eyes. I remember nothing until the next morning when my roommate woke me up to show me everything was back where it was the night before, like we'd never gone thru the apt and put all the chairs and furniture back. BTW, nothing ever happened in that apt ever again as far as I know. I don't know what it was, and I am pretty skeptical of ghosts, but I cannot discount what happened to me and my friend. I cannot discount what I heard, saw, or the nagging feeling of "i need to know" what happened that night. I am going to really consider what you said about going to psychics. I would prefer having an open minded professional that won't tell me I'm wrong about what I might find in my mind. Like, if they can't handle that I know I saw and heard some things then I wouldn't like to work with them on hypnosis. I need them to be able to listen without me fearing any kind of "you're lying", "you're mistaken", "that couldn't possibly have happened", etc etc. This event really happened, and I am sure it couldn't be just me and my friend that have had something like that happen to them. I just wonder why I blacked out or had missing time. That part bothers me more than any other aspect of that night.   </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Missing Time and Poltergeist Activity </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-03-16 06:04:16 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Without going into too much detail, I had an experience one night many years ago with a roommate. We were talking in her room when a litany of incredible poltergeist activity began ensuing. Apparently, this went on all night. I can't actually say just what happened after one point since I literally remember everything suddenly going back. Since this night I've heard some snippits of things that happened. For instance, my friend who my roommate and I had called and left a voicemail, we asked her to come right away, something really scary was going on. When she arrived in the morning (she worked nights), she found my roommate and i barricaded into her room, huddled in a corner with a knife. She says that when she was able to get thru the barricade that me and my roommate attacked her. I remember absolutely NONE of this. Is there anyone here that has heard of or experienced any such thing? I have looked for years online and have not found anything that connects ghosts with missing time. Only ufos. I don't think this was a ufo abduction, b/c of my friend seeing me and my roommate in that way. Any ideas or comments would be greatly appreciated, this event has caused me to consider undergoing hypnosis to actually recall the events. </TEXT>

Things that were deeper than "the white house beer recipe". I understand that certain questions really deserved a more in-depth answer than could be given on an AMA, but to disregard all those important questions is suspect. However, the site crashed, so it's hard to know if he was going to answer. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It really seems like the skeptic has never really looked into the phenomena deeply. I've been studying it for years, and yes, there is physical evidence. It's trace, but damnit it's there. On top of that, he sounds like an idiot. The picture they showed, while old, is famous and very well documented as a real *something*. He didn't even seem to recognize it. How can you have a skeptic that doesn't know the ins and outs of a phenomena he is so sure doesn't exist? I mean, let me give an example: I used to be religious. I know the ins and outs of the religion that I was a part of and when I was coming out of that religion to what I am now, I was able to look at all the facets and realize how every point was untrue. I can point to part of the religion and explain why it's false, I can PROVE it's false. This skeptic, couldn't do that. He couldn't prove his assertion. He just blindly stood by it. Pathetic. And yes, a Naysayer. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Reports of UFO's have been around since LONG before Chris Carter (creator of X-Files) was even born. And even before we had planes. I don't know why exactly the UFO's are interested in the US, you are right, there are more REPORTED sightings here. There are woodcuts from Nuremberg, Germany depicting battles in the sky between flying things from 1561.  Also, I would say that more people probably believe in ET's and UFO's in this day because of the sheer improvement in knowledge. We know that we're made of stardust, we know that the universe is incredibly old, we know that the building blocks of life are scattered throughout the universe. We know now about Panspermia. The chances of us being alone are nil. It's either us or there is a lot of life universally. So, if you start there, universe being old and filled with building blocks of life. Then you add in that we humans are barely a Type 1 civilization, and if you can imagine there may be Type 2 or even 3 civilizations, then it becomes harder to conceive that they wouldn't have technology to bend/fold/manipulate time and space.

So much to think about. But truthfully, the best thing I can tell you to do is look up. If you have access to GOOD Night Vision Binoculars, that will help too, as many of these crafts are only visible outside of our visual spectrum. Which could mean they are inter-dimensional or from another universe(maybe). It's just, honestly, super unlikely that we are alone. I think, you should start there. Contemplate: Could it just be us? Could this vast universe filled with the building blocks of life only have harbored life on Earth? I think if you consider it in those terms you will find that the odds are quite small we could be alone. Of course, if you are looking for a dead body and DNA, I am unable to produce that. 

Also, I don't know if the government is maliciously hiding information on this subject. I mean, I don't have special insider knowledge. BUT, I will say this: Our government HAS reported UFO's over nuke sites, these craft seemingly disabled (individually and remotely) their equipment. Also, you should look into the Rendlesham Forest Incident. Lots of military personnel reported seeing something strange over a few nights there, too. You can view the documents thru the FOIA. These are well-documented cases, too. The Mexican military also has RELEASED information and video concerning unknown flying objects over their skies as well. You can see this as easily as going to Youtube. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Maybe because we don't share their media? And, honestly, MUFON is just one of the many UFO reporting networks. I don't speak Chinese, so I don't know what reporting networks they have out there that I might be missing.

Have you heard about the Hessdalen Lights? Those are in Norway. They have sightings in Australia that are frequently reported. 

Could really be a language barrier and that US media is USA biased in that they report mostly on things happening in the bubble of USA. 

When you see an accident, do you call the UK police? Or do you call the American police? I think if you consider that sort of thinking it might make more sense to what I'm trying to convey. But I'm certain these events happen worldwide...imagine what happens over the oceans that no one ever sees?

OOOH and if you notice, most sightings that are reported happen in first world countries. So, that is another thing. Do they only hapen over FWC's? Probably not, we just have the ability to do so. That guy in the African bush isn't gonna get on his Iphone to take photos and upload em to Facebook and Twitter. India is mostly a 3rd world coutnry, people are too poor to really report, and China? I mean, it's communist, so it's very possible a lot of info doesn't even reach us.

Food for thought. I'm exhausted and going to bed. Take care and good luck with your search!! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm absolutely not ignoring my life. Not even a little. This post was about my lover. As for me, I am getting my life on track and getting a career, and a lot of it is actually because of this person. They have inspired me to do better in my life and go after things that I strive for. In so many ways, he's been good for me. :)

And it's ok that you made me cry, it's hard to hear the blunt truth about life sometimes. But I am giving it my best, and so is he. If it works out that'll be wonderful, but if not, I'll know why. So it's not so bad. I just got emotional when I found out he was leaving is all. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you! I feel very lucky to have witnessed such a sight! It was truly unbelievable, but yet, there it was...right in front of me. And, had I had better wits about me I would have taken out my camera phone and video'd or at least taken pictures. I don't know who that officer is, but I know s/he saw it, too, and I know it had to be life changing for them, it definitely was for me. I was always a believer but actually seeing it...it's vastly different. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It is possible they were orbs. They do not look like chinese lanterns as they'd be freaking HUGE compared to the distance.

I'm also not saying this is definitively alien, not at all, I'm just saying that the video in and of itself, is real.

But, I do think it might be orbs. Only because I've seen one, and know others who have seen them. They aren't some new phenomena, either. </TEXT>

check out that site. The map shows reports from all corners of the globe,and NO, visitation does not only occur in the USA.

Also, not all photos or videos are blurry, either.
During my sighting I wish I had taken a photo or video, but I was much much too engrossed in the object merely 25 feet in front of me to really consider doing so. It can be quite the awe-inspiring experience :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you want to give your money to a really great broadcast, you can try getting a Plus+ Club Account for Mysterious Universe.

You can see their extensive archive [here](http://www.http://mysteriousuniverse.org/tag/podcast/)|

These guys are based out of Austrailia, are hilarious, and they have some of the most interesting programming I've encountered in a while. It's like $9/month for the Plus+ Club, but it's worth it.

Next week will resume normal programming and later this month they are going syndicated by Premiere Networks, the same company that syndicates C2C. I really hope you enjoy it as much as I do. I really think this guy could be our next "Art Bell". </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I used to listen to C2C, but when Noory took over as host he kinda, well, sucked. I continued to listen but I got bored of the content, and missed Art. I've since started listening to Ground Zero Radio with Clyde Lewis. His program and guests are awesome and Clyde is a fantastic host. He brings elements of Art and even Alex Jones (but much less shouting), and has that 'spooky' factor that I'm looking for :) </TEXT>

	<TITLE> My Love Leaves Soon... </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2012-08-15 05:27:45 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> My lover is leaving for college for the next 1 1/2 - 2 years. He won't have a car with him and I own no car. I am currently saving up for one, but it's going to still be a bit before I can see him. This is upsetting as I just found out Sunday and he leaves Friday. Words cannot express how much I will miss him and how much I also am proud of him, too. Such a mix of emotions that I am going thru. So much is up in the air. I worry, will he find someone else? Will he forget about me? Will he decide that a long distance relationship does not work for him? I wish I had a crystal ball, but I don't think I could peer into it thru my misty, watery eyes. </TEXT>
