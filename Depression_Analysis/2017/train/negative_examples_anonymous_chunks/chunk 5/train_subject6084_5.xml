	<TEXT> Seems about right. You can buy a gram of L-glucose [here](http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/catalog/product/sigma/g5500?lang=en region=US) for $84.90. Gold is currently $42 a gram, so yeah at least 50% more than gold by weight.

Google tells me that there are 39 grams of sugar in a can of coke, so a can of left handed coke would cost over $3300.


^(edit: to all those pointing out that 84 is 100% more than 42: this post is intended as a back-of-the-envelope sanity check on the information in the post title. Hence "at least". Many factors can influence the relative costs, including the amount and source of L-glucose, as has been pointed out in comments.) </TEXT>
