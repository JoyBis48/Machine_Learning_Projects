	<TEXT> I have a similar problem but its not related to anyones attention span.  Most people just care more about being right than they care about having an honest dialog.  Someone who cares about intellectual honesty or participates in the argument to develop a more complete understanding of an issue will always be at a strategic disadvantage when arguing with someone that just wants to win. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think this is right. In an honest discussion you have to be ready to be convinced. If you believe you have unique access to the capital "t" Truth  you are really just a salesman and do a disservice to yourself, the other party and the dialog itself. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> don't forget Chuang Tzu (Zhuangzi / Zhuang Zhou). Probably a close #2 in terms of importance to the tradition.  A little heavier than the Tao te Ching but but the parables can be helpful is fleshing out some of the more abstract concepts that students sometimes have trouble grasping.

	<TEXT> I use Evernote to catalog what I feel are useful contributions to arguments I find interesting.  Counter arguments to economic libertarianism and Austrian econ are some of my favorites.  Here are a few that stuck out as I browsed. 

These are all going to be anti-Austrian for the most part. Mises.org should give you enough material for where the Austrians stand from their prospective.

	<TITLE> What does r/hiphopheads think of Deltron 3030 - Event 2? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-10-11 20:17:42 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> First, let me just say that Im one of those people who tries to listen to an album 3 or 4 times from beginning to end before I decide what I think about it. Some of my favorite albums I didn't even like on my first listen. So, this may be a little premature since Ive only gotten through it a couple of times, but Im slightly underwhelmed. 

If Deltron 3030 is just a colab between Dan the Automator, Kid Koala, and Del then it an adequate to good follow up. In my mind, Deltron 3030 was one of the best concept albums of all time in any genre. Event 2 is missing that epic future apocalypse sound that characterized the first record.  

Are my expectations so high that I cant help but be let down? What do you guys think of it so far?
