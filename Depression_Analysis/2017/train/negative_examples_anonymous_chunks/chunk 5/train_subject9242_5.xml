It is behind a paywall but it found the link tenuous. 


Glophosphate (roundup) DOES have legitimate concerns about overuse and the ubiquity with which it is applied, but it isn't dangerous in the sense that something like lead is. 

Glyophosphate only lasts for like a few hours before it denatutes and becomes harmless, it isn't something that would harm you if someone sprayed it on your food a week before it was harvested. And it isn't sprayed soon before harvest, so a lot of the baseless concerns seem to be ridiculous.

https://ceruleangypsy.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/mens-hair-3.jpg

I like this cut as it is kind of neat while still being much more fun than a traditional cut. If you keep it combed back it looks very handsome. 


I also think something similar to chris hemsworth but a few inches shorter would be a sweet spot. Something like a inch or two shorter than the photo in the back.
