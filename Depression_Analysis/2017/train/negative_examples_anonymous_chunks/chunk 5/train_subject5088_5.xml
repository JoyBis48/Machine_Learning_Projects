	<TEXT> I'm on mac but found the folder. Unfortunately, the adding them back and having to select the download destination for all of them was what I was hoping to avoid as I have 1000+ torrents across 4 different hard drives. Oh well, lesson learned.   </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Accidentally removed ALL torrents from my client (uTorrent) - help! </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-02-25 10:53:50 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Sometimes I need to stop all my torrents so I will select all and hit the stop button up top... except this time, while sleep deprived at 4:30 AM in the morning, I accidentally hit the remove button besides it and thus removing ALL of my completed/seeding torrents. Is there an undo function or cache somewhere of these torrents? I literally had 1,000+ torrents and will not be feasible for me to go individually download all of the .torrent files over again. 

Thanks in advance for any advice!  </TEXT>

EDIT link here: http://full-stream.net/5920-19-2-saison-2.html 

FYI the French scene is literally 100% the same tracking shot wise (and even shot in the same school). There are some minor differences in terms of acting and timing. The French version seems to close the shot a little better (dialogue wise), again the shot is the same.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Way too much was cut and the movie looses so much in terms of tone and theme of the original musical. The worse offense being both the act 1 ending number "Ever After" and the act 2 opening number "Once Upon a Time...Later" which is the entire premise of the story as being what happens after the typical "fairy tale" ending. Also, unnecessary change on the death of the Baker's Wife. 

I would really recommend people see another version of this, whether it be live on stage or the recorded version of the original stage production. This is one of my favorite musicals, but so many of the best songs are cut in the movie and it looses so much of it's humor and story in the process. 

Such a shame. Rob Marshall did an excellent job with Chicago... what happened here? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yup, that was my point exactly. 

BUT The Interview wasn't planned as a VoD release either... so maybe studios would be willing to approve a smaller budget film with a targeted VoD release. In my opinion, not every film demands a moving theater going experience (especially with the prices of tickets these days), but for smaller films or dramas will little action that necessitates a big screen viewing, this could be a great way to capture revenue from people who might otherwise just pirate it or watch it TV or rent it later.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is impressive considering how unplanned the VOD release was. However, you have to temper that with the fact that this movie had HUGE publicity proceeding it, beyond what they planned on marketing so at the end of the day, this will still be a bit of an anomaly. 

Still, it will be interesting to see if Hollywood decides to use this as a case study and attempt to do more VOD related releases (whether it be stand alone or simultaneous with a big screen release).  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi guys, so I've heard a lot of things are closed during this period - just wondering how bad it is. I'm visiting with my family - do we need to make reservations or probably just be able to wander about and just find a place to eat whenever we feel like breaking? I'm asking in particular about the night of Dec 24th and Dec 25th. 

Also, are all places and shops closed on Dec 25th or are some things still open. Do you guys have any recommended areas for these days (aside from touristy sights like cathedrals or museums). 

Thanks!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Bridesmaid dresses are different. For some weddings, the bride is very specific about the exact dress or exact color and style of dress that she wants her bridesmaids to wear. In this situation, you are forced to buy a dress that you never wear again because of how impractical it is or if it's ugly and not really your style. These are the sacrifices you make for friendship.  </TEXT>
