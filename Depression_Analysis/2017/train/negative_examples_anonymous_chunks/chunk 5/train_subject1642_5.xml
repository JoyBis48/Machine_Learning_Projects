	<TEXT> Yeah I can tomorrow. It doesn't even look too bad the eye lid is just a bit red. Not even puffy really. Might it be possible she poked her eye with some hay? She does tend to toss it around and role in it... A lot... Lol </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey, my rabbit is sick. One of her eyes is red and she's got a stuffy nose! She's still bouncing around and happy, eating (and tossing her bowl when she's done) with no sign of pain whatsoever. I'm thinking it may be a cold but I'm unsure. The vet literally won't do anything with her. Like that shouldn't even be a thing but he just keeps saying she's okay. The closest one is 3 miles away and I can walk that but the next one is 12 miles away. If it could be something serious I'll do it but she seems fine. Sometimes she'll close the eye but that's it. Any suggestions? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> With a 9 wrap parallel you'll get the same surface area as an 18 wrap with lower  though is the point I'm making I guess. But definitely if you can push more power through the coils you'll get comparable results. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> BMW 328i overheating </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-05-31 05:36:10 </DATE>

	<TEXT> Edit: it is a 94 BMW 325i not a 328, not sure why the 8 is there.


Hello, I've been having some trouble with my BMW overheating. I bought this car because I wanted something nice to drive and also a car I could learn to work on. So today removed the radiator and the fan blades (?) To change the thermostat which went well but after reassembly when I turned it on and ran it for about 20 minutes it began over heating again! There is white smoke coming from under the left side of the engine which leads me to believe there could be a leaky head gasket but I noticed something rather peculiar. The hose to the right of the water pump was hot to the touch, but to the hose to left of it was much cooler (still hot, but not nearly as much). I took it to national tire and battery for a pressure check and they said it held 75lbs of pressure just fine. Any thought guys?



TLDR: 94 BMW 325i overheating, pressure check went well, small amount of white smoke coming from under engine on passenger side, changed thermostat and it didn't help. </TEXT>
