	<TEXT> I use Downcast but it's been very slow for me lately so I have a question about other podcast apps. When I'm catching up on podcasts I normally listen to 3/4 series at once and I listen to them in the order they were released in. So for example in my current relisten I'm on May 2013. So in downcast I click on Downloaded and all my podcast episodes (doesn't matter the series) are sorted by date. That means I listen to the one at the top.

In past experience podcast episodes were always sorted by the actual podcasts. Has this changed in most other apps? </TEXT>
