	<TEXT> Casino, obviously. 

Boogie Nights is basically Goodfellas but with porn actors, one of my all time favorites. 

The Departed is kinda similar. Not exactly the same but still gangsters and definitely worth watching.

Maybe try Snatch, Donnie Brasco, Carlitos Way, Usual Suspects, Blow, True Romance, Chopper, American Hustle.
Scarface is like a crazy cartoon version. 

There are a lot of gangster movies out there, but very very few of them are as fast paced and naturalistic with an awesome soundtrack like Goodfellas. Casino and Boogie Nights are definitely the other movies I can think of that are quite the same.
Wolf of Wall Street seems to be the most Goodfellasy thing Scorcese has done since Goodfellas. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The giant killer sperm from The Filth freaked me out. Not especially gory or anything bit it just made me feel dirty.

There were some pretty dark things happening in the first half (good half) of Irredeemable. Mostly kids getting killed in various ways.  

There was that terrible Lovecraftian book that Alan Moore wrote where a woman got raped by a fish demon and then later gave him a handjob. That was doubly fucked up because that was the genius behind Watchmen, Killing Joke and V for Vendetta writing that nonsense.

And of course anytime Garth Ennis gets all shock gore crazy, which is usually more fucked up than anything else on my list but I think I've become desensitized to him by now.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The T-rex wasn't originally in the cargo hold. 

It was in that big steel cage that was sitting on the deck of the boat. We see it in that cage after Roland tranquilized it when everyone is leaving the island by helicopter.

Then when Malcolm and Sarah get on the boat you can see that the cage is torn open. The T-rex broke out of the cage, killed a bunch of people, and then chased people into the cargo hold or something, and a dying crew member closed the cargo doors.

There was that one hand inside the captain's cabin holding on to the steering wheel, which was weird, but I guess maybe the T-Rex was able to stick his head through the door to eat that guy or something. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The cheesy church music and the fact that it seems to be pretending that this is a true historical event make this movie seem way more like a laughable made for TV religious family movie with a big budget.

The clapping didn't help either.

Hopefully this was just a terrible trailer and was not at all representative of the final film... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not really. It's a trilogy of thematically linked films, all about revenge with a very dark twisted tone, but they're completely unrelated in terms of story and characters.

Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance, Oldboy, and Sympathy for Lady Vengeance. Oldboy is absolutely the best one.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Can you continue playing as all three characters once the campaign is over?

I've heard rumors about one if the characters potentially dying. I remember how much it sucked when John died at the end of Red Dead. I mean it worked great for story reasons, but since there was no warning I had to restart and play through the entire game again so that I could create an alternate save before the end so I could keep playing in the open world as John. 

So without giving too much away, will I be able to keep playing as all three characters when the story ends, or am I going to have to create an alternate save or something? </TEXT>
