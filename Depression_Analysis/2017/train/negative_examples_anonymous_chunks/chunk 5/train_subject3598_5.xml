I then in Excel, divided the working age population data of Britain and France with their real GDP, PPP from 1950 to 2013.

In Excel, I then detrended the growth rates of real GDP, PPP per British and French by 1.9% to identify eras of the above than by the low average growth in these countries. 

I then annotated the resulting chart with the classic descriptions of eras such as "never had it so good", "British disease" and Thatcheromics.

	<TEXT> When doing some research into the economics of natural disasters after the Christchurch earthquake, I looked up rent control and track down the famous pamphlet George Stigler and Milton Friedman in 1946.

To my astonishment, it started with a discussion of the housing market in San Francisco after the 1906 earthquake and compared to its functioning to the housing market in the same city after World War II rent controls to see which coped better. </TEXT>

I tabulated in Excel the 1979 and 2005 shares of income by top 1% and top 0.1% occupations. 

To present that data in a unique way, I sorted the 1979 in 2005 income shares by the occupations from the smallest to largest increase in income shares of the top 1% and top 0.1% between 1979 in 2005. </TEXT>

Firstly for the USA I plotted the shares of income coming from wages, salaries and  pensions or from entrepreneurial income in Excel. I then plotted a separate chart showing how much of the incomes of the top 0.1% in the USA came from dividends, interest and rents respectably.

The same charts were then plotted in Excel for Canada of wages, salaries and pensions and entrepreneurial incomes and for dividends, interest and rents for the top 0.1%. </TEXT>

In modern politics, you don't give an inch so you reject the science because you don't like the economic solutions that would result even though you may have independent and valid reasons on economic grounds for rejecting the proposed solutions.

Libertarians do attract a lot of comment and the Twitter Left is rather keen to label the right-wing opponents, as libertarians. This is despite the fact a lot of voters don't understand what a libertarian is.

Indeed, back in the 1990s, most libertarian gatherings were so small that they would not need to book ahead at a restaurant to make sure they got a table.

It is only recently that Milton Friedman became a respectable figure in policy circles. Indeed, at job interviews in the 1990s, if you mentioned Hayek's name, and there is any sign of name recognition, you would been interviewed by a very well read people. </TEXT>

Nice little paper pointing out what should be obvious to everyone. Nonviolent protest can entice sympathy and support from the majority. Violent protests have the exact opposite effect, including a law and order backlash among voters.

Roundabout way of saying that a Republican won the 1968 election on a law and order platform, not a Democrat on a peace platform.

As I recall my warned over Marxism, is the idea of violent protests to exit provoked that backlash and the resulting repression cause the proletariat to see that capitalists for whom they are and rise up and overthrow them.

	<TEXT> I used Excel and Open Office Draw to divide real GDP purchasing power parity for New Zealand, Switzerland and Australia from the conference board total database by their respective working age populations from OECD statextract.

I compared New Zealand and Swiss GDP per working age person with that in Australia to show a normal economy as compared to two in long depressions.

I then detrended real GDP purchasing power parity per working age New Zealander, Swiss and Australian by 1.9% to show that Swiss and New Zealand economies had deviated by 30% or more from trend between the 1973 and the early to mid-1990s. That is, both economies were in a great depression over those respective periods. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> All agree that the consumer price index (CPI) is biased and overstates inflation. In 1996, economists hired by the Senate Finance Committee estimated that the U.S. CPI overstates annual inflation by 1.1% (Boskin et al. 1996). That estimated CPI bias has not gotten smaller with time. It is now up to 1.5%, even 2%.

I thought I might see what happened if I I used Excel two take account of this one and a half percentage point annual bias because of new goods, quality variation and other known biases in the CPI estimates for the USA, UK and Japan in the relevant OECD StatExtract database for annual CPI inflation.

	<TEXT> SUBMISSION STATEMENT

When Brennan said at a tax reform conference in Australia over 20 years ago that efficient taxes and tax reforms are both bad because they lead to higher taxes and a larger government, no one understood him.

Idealists all, the audience, including me, assumed they were advising a benevolent government, not a revenue-maximising leviathan government  a beast that needed to be staved with constitutional constraints on the number and size of tax bases and tax instruments.

Fiscal arrangements were analysed by Buchanan and Brennan in The Power to Tax in terms of the preferences of citizen-taxpayers who are permitted at some constitutional level of choice to select the fiscal institutions they are to be subject to over an uncertain future.

Those in elected office are assumed to exploit the powers assigned to them to the maximum possible extent: government is a revenue-maximising leviathan.

Buchanan and Brennan were all for inefficient tax systems because they do not raise as much revenue. A government that cannot raise much revenue cannot grow very large.

It was a number of years before I came to agree with Brennan and Buchanan. I had to break out of my applied welfare economics thinking and move over to constitutional political economy.

Tax reform saved the late 20th century welfare state by raising the same or more revenue with less taxpayer resistance. </TEXT>
