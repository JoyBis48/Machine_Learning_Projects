	<TEXT> I never really liked Pascal's wager. Belief isn't like an on/off switch; you can't just make yourself believe something because you want the potential rewards if it turns out to be true.

As far as living forever, it's going to end eventually at some point with the heat death/big crunch of the universe. I have no idea if there is a God, but I figure it's best to just be nice to everyone and live as long as possible with technology.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There was also a story the Russians built a nuke in their embassy in Washington DC. Since diplomatic packages aren't allowed to be searched by customs, the Russians had it brought in piece by piece and had an expert assemble it in the embassy. That way, if things went to hell, they could detonate a nuke right in the middle of DC with zero warning time or chance of being intercepted.

	<TEXT> I like that European countries got together to make the EU. Yes it has problems and, who knows, maybe it will get worse. But that fact that the people got together and said "It's the 21st century, let's stop messing around with different currencies, trade barriers, etc. and just work together is amazing. It really gives me hope for the future."

Also the people are nice! </TEXT>
