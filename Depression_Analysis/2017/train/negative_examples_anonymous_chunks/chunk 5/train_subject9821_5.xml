	<TEXT> I mean come on use your imagination, but here is a few





1.Disliked tyson




2.Money on the fight




3.Money on the round it would end in, not specifically the fighters




4.a much more memorable fight with tyson losing, having him in the spotlight




5.he was tired, ready to go home




6.Money on tyson getting knocked out, which was probaly like a 1000 to 1




7.Paid off by douglass





On and on. Im not saying it was melicous but its a possibility. He might of just made an error. But to say tyson got the same count and time to get up is easily debunked by the tape, its an obvious difference. Half a second can be a world of difference to a boxer in that situation, and its a more than half a second difference. Again im not a big tyson fan, but a big boxing fan and there is concern about the difference in counts that ruin the fight for me.





If you like the big upset aspect of a fight as you said in your first post, look into Rumble in the Jungle, Ali wasnt even supose to Survive the fight, thats literally what they said. There was major concern for his well being. The KO is the greatest moment in boxing history imo </TEXT>

He seems like the type of person to bitch about the confederate flag but ignore the nazi symbols or christian symbol in the country and ignore all the horror and slavery associated with them. Also type of person to get uppity only when a racial crime is covered by the media and ignore the countless others that happen every day. May be wrong but this post leads me to believe not. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you are defining southern heritage as the rebel flag, ill agree with most of what you said. But i also respect those to have a different opinion and their right to wave a flag, any flag. Should they change the flag, no, its historical. Should it be hung from government buildings, that is a tricky question, and imo no. But do i care if my neighbor has one on his car, house, shirts, no and frankly neither should you. Not every northerner was against slavery either. For that matter there are just as much racist northerners as they are in the south, now and back then.




If your defining heritage as tradition, or inheritance, again not every southerner supported or participated in slavery. Do you define your family traditions by every wrong they have ever done? Is it possible in your mind to uphold your family traditions even if you disagree with their actions? Do you define your northern heritage as having a major hand in the wrongful slaughter of the Native americans?





Also on another note. Slavery was only combated partially on the notion of human rights, and the slaves lively hood. And partially because the south and its exports, cotton,etc, could charge whatever they wanted. The north had no leverage, they couldnt boycott forever. The south wasnt effected by such because they didnt pay their workers. So eventually the north would have to agree to much higher price than deserved. The civil war was fought partially for human rights and partially for economic of goods, including a few other reasons.




Your post implies that all southern heritage is from slave owners and the northern heritage has no such implications, this is ludicrous. I would assume most reasonable people in the country dont feel that way. Every person who lived in the north were not against slavery nor do they have clean hands when it comes to racism and equal rights, same can be said of the south.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Few more questions for you, btw thaks for the repiies.




1.How does the protein on the egg thing age 5 or 6 years if the box can only go back as far as it has been initialy set? 




2.Is it possible aaron tells Grady(father) about the machine after the original party incident where something presumbaly happens to his daughter?  take the emergency coversation abe and aaron have into play




3.Is there a logical explaination for why Granger is sitting outside aarons house and why he ran away after following them? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 1.Ok so every box usage creates a parallel timeline. So we are being talked to from aaron 2 from the 3rd timeline? Because timeline 2 doesnt have a 3rd aaron, and once the timelines pass the loop the original cease to exist so thats why there is 2 left at the end? With this logic there would have to have been 3 abes but he doesnt use the machine with aaron the 3rd time he goes alone to switch with aaron2, so why are we left with the same number of abes and aarons when they didnt use the machine the same amout of times?




2.Ill buy that




3.REDDIT




4.Ill buy that, and i originally assumed that. But what do they do with the body(i realize this is speculation), or they keep the body till it passes the loop and it ceases to exist? Wouldnt keeping the body at aarons have aaron1 directly crossing paths with 2 n 3(which aaron does cross paths but abe doesnt know that and trys to prevent such an act so why would abe willing do this?)? 




5.So they are voluntarily up in the attic? Was this explained why they went in the attic instead of say a hotel? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 1.So you are saying the only aaron left at the end is the one building the bigger machine? What about the 2 abes, the one watching for aaron and the original?



2.How would aaron 2, narrator, know about the last timeline, or the countless times he went back to change the partys outcome?




3.Ill buy that, just seemed like there was more to it.




4.It seemed like how Granger found out and used the machine was a complete mystery to aaron and abe, did they figure it out? They never actually use the failsafes together and i thought abe at that point was unaware that aaron knew about the fail safes.





5.Ill buy that, but why can the girl hear rat like sounds in the attic?

	<TEXT> Never seen EH, but i have seen this graph. It contradicts some other explainations ive seen but its damn detailed.



It doesnt answer my questions unfortunately. What happens after the timeline does abe 12345 cease to exist like wiki says or some other possibility? And if they do how is the end possible?


It doesnt touch on my 2nd and 3rd questions. For that matter not even the 4th or 5th but i realize the last two questions are most likely unanswerable to 100% certainity. 




I feel like im missing something here, thats obvious im just not grasping. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> SPOILERS




According to wiki, once the original version passes the loop he ceases to exist and the traveller continues. How does the end make sense in this logic?




Assuming wiki is wrong, Aaron travels back to change the party 20 times or more, shouldnt there be 20 or more versions?




Abe tells aaron in the airport dont force me to use the power i have, what is he referring to?




What do they do with comatose Grady? 




How do they keep the versions of themselves locked in the attic, why can the wife or SO hear rat like noises?





Will say Great movie, watched it earlier today 1st time and have been spending time trying to piece it together. Through reddit and google. Any help with these questions would be appreciated

	<TEXT> You keep throwing around insults, falsifying stats, and the whole time completely missing the point of the thread. Its not a thread about tattoos effect on you getting a job, which you keep bringing up. Its comical to epic proportions your bias against tattoos and your judgement of those who have them. Made quite clear by you trolling this thread that has nothing to do with the bias points you are failing to make, NOTHING. Make your own thread to hate on, or stay on the topic at hand, but either way im appalled by your bias and amused at your ignorance on the subject. Hope you dont act like this in public.... </TEXT>
