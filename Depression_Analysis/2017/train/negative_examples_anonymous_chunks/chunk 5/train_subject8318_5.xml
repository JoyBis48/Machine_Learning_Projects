	<TEXT> This! Even in the Lost World, Isla Sorna was totally abandoned. It would be great to see a story of the hurricane hitting the island and seeing shit hit the fan as workers try to get off the island as dinosaurs begin to break loose. I always felt like Isla Sorna was a more ambitious project than the '93 Isla Nublar. I want to see it before it was hit by the storm.  </TEXT>

It reminds me of some sick fever dream I might have had as a child. I wouldn't mind getting stoned and watching something similar to this. Anybody know of any other videos like this? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh my GOD! I LISTENED TO THAT SONG SO MANY TIMES IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL!!! 5th grade, 2005, specifically! I really thought it was Weird Al. Me and my buddy used to jam out to this in his shed when we first learned how to use the internet on our own. There was a YTMND and I remember finally finding an mp3 of it and being so happy. My parents didn't like it when I sang it at the dinner table. Haha I'm so happy you made this post. Thank you, catthedd. You had an influence on some young children in Arizona. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I believe you. I don't necessarily believe they stole your story per se, but I actually know a few people that have also written scripts for Jurassic Park IV that are eerily similar to Jurassic World. I think a lot of people have a lot of the same ideas of what they would want to see in a new JP film. </TEXT>
