	<TEXT> Assuming new character, it takes way more than 2 months (66 days) for something simple like this: https://zkillboard.com/kill/42580382/ . That's not including required fitting skills like PWG/Cap managment (or jury rigging skills), and all level 4 on everything related excluding weapon upgrades. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not me, if you look close enough you can see I said 'near' perfect skills. At least in solo pvp if you want to even try to win the majority of fights, you should have at least all level 4 on the related skills. Of course you can still be really annoying with EWAR at a low skill level, but something like DPS you need good skills or you'll feel useless. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not very feasable. There are ways to do it, but its quickly going to turn into a job, and is probably an easy way to get burnt out. Sharing money from invites is probably referring to the 21 day trial invite. The inviter gets a PLEX which is worth approximately 930mill isk, as long as you actually upgrade your trial into a full account. If you do this with someone you trust they can split the $$$ with you. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When warping from system to system (BRAVE Corp.), they got caught in a warp disruption bubble that stops their warp and traps them inside the bubble, stopping them from warping off. As soon as this happened Rooks and Kings used the most expensive ship in the game (titan) to teleport themselves into that bubble. Rooks and Kings were in specially tanked, AOE damage dealing ships. So essentially it's like a group of people walking into an ambush and then throwing molotov cocktails on their faces. Really effective, hard to pull off.

Edit: I take too long to respond apparently! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey,

My apologies in advance if this is in bad etiquette, i'm not sure what the rule is regarding meta/self posts on this sub. 

I don't really frequent this sub, but after looking through the comments of http://www.reddit.com/r/food/comments/2k30b0/i_cant_stop_winning_chili_cookoffs/ this post I can't really say that I will now, or understand why anyone else does.

I understand people are passionate about what they love, whether that be chilli or food in general, but there's really no need for the amount of pure vitriol and hatred in that thread. The OP came here to share their love for food, and it's really disgusting that people feel the need to post/upvote (gross 46 upvotes) shit like this: 

Jesus fucking christ. This is almost as bad as that retard last week who posted cheetos and beef jerky as snacks to go with wine. Sonnn.
Recipe for award winning chili: grab a can of everything from the Hispanic shelf at Walmart. Dump in crockpot. Eat with fritos.

and this (gross 15 upvotes)

That looks fucking disgusting. Also, it's not chili, it's "Kentucky Bean and Corn Surprise."

These are only two examples of the purely malicious comments that were posted in that thread. How can you expect people to share in your passion if you try to bully them into accepting your opinion?

If this gets removed because meta/self posts aren't allowed then my only hope is for the mods to take this into consideration.

If it dosen't, then please, think before you type. There's people behind the computer screens, and damn good  way to share your passion for something, and maybe change their opinion, is to be friendly about it, and to teach them like their your friend, not the enemy.

Cheers. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Assuming that's the case I don't disagree. And I can completely understand how they might have intended that post to classify this as an exploit, but taking that rule with no context (which shouldn't have to be provided, it should speak for itself), it's ambiguous. I don't think arguing this is going to change anything, however. I understand your point, and if you're right CCP will reimburse the person and maybe banhammer the offenders. Good talk. </TEXT>

If you're referring to the CCP post, it heavily implies that it's talking about lighting a cyno while the forcefield is already online. I agree it's an exploit (at **best** a clever use of game mechanics) but i'm just not so sure it's *official*. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If I understand your post correctly people knew about lighting a cyno then putting up the forcefield 6 years ago and took that post as saying that was an exploit? Or did people know that they could light one inside an already lit forcefield, as the post implies? Apologies for my ignorance, but I wasn't around for this exploit.

Still, your below post right, it's stupid to even walk on the thin line, whatever CCP's stance. Hopefully this will provoke a statement from them. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That post heavily implies you shouldn't be able to light a cyno inside an *already up* field (as opposed to lighting a cyno, then putting up the field), although it does not explicitly state that. Seems to me CCP need's to put out another, clearer, statement on whether this is allowed. After all this is 6 years later too. </TEXT>
