	<TEXT> ok so if anyone has been somewhat following any of my recent posts, I basically was cut off from a 120 a month norco script that I was on for over a year. I was able to come to a comprimise with my doctor and she is going to give me ultram to help with my withdrawls.  what can i do with this stuff? i have avoided it in the past due to reading that it can cause gnarly seizsures.  should I take a chance on this stuff and is it any fun?? </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> so i started on subs a week ago.  lasted a week but had a ton of norco so 2 days ago i took some.  i waited about 30 hours for it to be out of my system.  Problem is that its not hitting me the same as it did before I took subs.  I know the whole thing about the bupe blocking your opiate receptors and it could take a bit for real opiates to work.  Its now friday afternoon and i last dosed my subs at 11am tuesday.  Do I need to keep waiting or are my receptors just fried??  I hope I can still get somewhat high again.  I am a noob to subs but not to opiates. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> same thing basically happened to me but i got completely cut off.  I had an appoinment yesterday with a "pain phychiratrist"  and she said that about 8-10 years ago it was fairly easy to get opiates prescribed from your doctor but in just the last year or 2 they have really been tightening up and its only going to be harder to get legal dope. she cited the obvious reasons - the DEA and all the dumbass famous people that couldnt handle their shit that is all in the media BUTTT  she also said that there have been recent studies showing that opiates do not really help for long term pain unless you are really old/have cancer its going to be near impossible and the fact that I am 32 not 62 makes it a lot harder for me to acquire those meds. that is basically what she told me.  She was really nice, straightforward and honest so I have no reason not to believe what she told me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> so this week I am waving the white flag and going to try suboxone after having my doctor cut me off after prescribing me opiates for about 5 years.  I have been using around 10 norcos daily for the last 6 months.  I have heard people say that subs might be a bit too much for my habit but i really don't know what to do as I will soon be out of norcos with no script anymore.  both of my parents and a lot of my family have died from drugs so the addiction and craving is pretty instilled in me.  thinking subs might help with that.  thoughts?!?!  thanks!! </TEXT>

Well since I got cut off my plan on tuesday is to just put up the white flag and get on suboxone.  i am just sick and tired of playing the game with my doctor and sometimes going to the streets since my tolerance has gone up.  I got screwed but fuck it.  Just hope that people will take heed to my warning even if they are set up with a cushy doctor like I was.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> honestly I just wish they could prescribe opiates for depression!! I have been on Paxil for about 12 years and i feel like it does jack shit.  but the minute I take a pain pill i'm a new person.  and to top it off it does alleviate my physical pain as well when I can take all the ibuprofen in the world and that won't cut it.  I am definatly mentally and physically addicted to pain meds and have to qualms admitting that.  yes I am tired of playing the whole doctor game and i guess being cut off could be a good thing in the end for me possibly.  also the big head honcho pain doc doesn't even adhere to MRI's  he told me you take 10 normal people, MRI them and 9/10 will come back with some kind of damage.  This guy was a complete piece of fucking work. </TEXT>

I am i think about in the same boat as you where its a fine line between using them for what they are intended for or just strictly for recreation.  also I am not trying to scare you but i was in your exact doctor situation and it happened to me so I guess always have a back up plan if you plan on staying on opiates for a while. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes I do.  I have some pretty severe sports injuries to both of my ankles that do require surgery. at least that is what a podiatrist in my town told me when I visited him.  You can physically see how gnarled and distorted my feet are. I had an MRI done about 5 years ago and you could see the internal damage and I am sure that my ankles have just gotten worse since then.  I will admit though I love opiates and the way they make me feel, I am addicted. So maybe this is the wake up call I need to get off of them even though I have legit pain. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> ok the only problem is that I have Kaiser insurance right now.  I can't just switch docs under my Kaiser insurance because any doctor working under Kaiser will see that it was recommended that I be cut off of my monthly script (120 norcos) so I don't think I could even stay with Kaiser.  I could try to change insurances and completely get out of Kaiser (which I plan on doing sooner or later) but in the time being paying out of pocket with no insurance is not going to be fun.  So I am just kind of stuck in a rough place because even if I tried to get new medical insurance today it still would take probably months for it to kick in. I live in California if that makes any difference.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> jei do have mris. Ligaments and tendons wrecked to hell.  She specifically cut me off for the reasons i stated before.   She referred me to pain mgmt and their head doc said right off the bat no more narcotics.  My prescribing doctor is in love with this guy so the second he put in the recommendation she adhered.  All i really heard was a lot of talk about the DEA and obamacare. These are simply facts, shitty ones at that but that is what transpired that day. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I guess we'll just have to wait.  these are facts and exactly what I was told by real doctors so it's just a head's up.  Even if the doctors I have been dealing with are using it as an excuse to cut me off even though I have never showed signs of drug seeking. I know I am not the first victim of this shit and it's probably gonna get worse. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> yes I do.  at least persistant enough to have supposedly been prescribed what I was receiving for several years. funny thing is that I really never even pushed or asked for norcos- she just kind of kept upping it. i started on 5/500 vics.    </TEXT>

	<TEXT> and also. for people with legit opiate scripts like myself:  what do you plan on doing since the DEA and the whole ObamaCare thing is going to REALLY REALLY start fucking us over very soon???  I bring this up because that is what every doctor I have dealt with in the last 2 weeks has told me.  This shit is about to get fucking real I think.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> In my last post I told everyone how i was cut off by my doctor.  I have been scripted 120 10/325s for about 2 years now. I am under Kaiser Permanente northern california. She has been wanting me to do the Kaiser pain program for about 8 months telling me how good the head doctor is and how much she respects him.  I thought ok if she is referring me to a pain program I should be set right?!?!  Big mistake.  It took me about 2 months just be seen but when I went to my appointment he walks in and immediately says you need to stop taking norco.  he then berates me for about 20 mins about how much pain he has had for the last 30 years and he only takes about 4 percocet a month.  anyways i knew that i was fucked when he said he wanted me cut off since my regular doc that prescribes me the norcos looks up to this guy.  After that i have my app with her and she is like yep, you are done.  Most fucked up thing is she told me verbally more than once that when I got into this pain program that they would "at least start me on some low dose oxycontin"  I cannot believe what dirty shit was pulled on me.  I have had the same primary doctor for over 5 years and she was basically family to me.  She would always hug me and tell me I was one of her favorites.  Anyways my question is, I am thinking of ditching Kaiser all together and trying to get onto something like Medical.  I have proof I have been scribed the norcos for several years.  How hard would it be to get a new doctor to carry over that script?  Is it worth trying?  It's not like i'm coming out of the blue asking for them so I would think I have a bit of an advantage but just want to know everyone's thoughts. THANKS!!!!!

	<TEXT> thanks man. the reason why i brought up subs is that I aknowledge that i am physically and mentally addicted to opiates.The small amount of research that I have done leads me to believe that it helps with your mental cravings for opiate which I need to address. Even if i was to taper off the norcos that would work but would probably not do shit to stop me from craving them mentally.  I dunno though...... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> i have had withdrawls before when I had to stop taking a smaller dose in the past. it sucked but wasn't the end of the world.  Obamacare is what he is blaming this on.  I get 120 a month but I usually take up to 8 a day ( i know i know haha)  i went to suboxone.com and found several docs in my area.  i guess i will just call around tomorrow and tell them my situation and if its even logical to do?  i couldn't really find anything on the site that was specific about how much you take or what you take pertaining to if suboxone would help that.  I will admit that I am physically and mentally addicted though so I thought this could work. thanks for the input.

	<TEXT> so I just found out today that my doctor who has had me on norco for the last 4 years wants to to quit cold turkey and is cutting me off. this really sucks but it's something I guess I have to deal with.  How do I go about obtaining a suboxone script and is this the best option to help me? I mentioned it to her and she kinda wrote me off, i don't think she was in a good mood.  I am on about 6-8 10mg Norcos.  thanks guys.   </TEXT>
