	<TEXT> Aside from reading lots of books, I've self taught myself how to write.

My solution? Write it and write it again, until it doesn't read like crap! It's sounds stupid, but reading it out loud to someone (I read to my GF) really helps you spot the errors in everything.

Best thing to do is get it onto the page- write it without editing or rereading it until you're done. It's easier to edit a crap novel into a good one than just write a good novel instantly. Only the super-pros have that kind of super power. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My first time was on my Dad's boss' computer- we lived next door to the office he worked in at the time (it was a house converted to an office), and I used to go up there to mess about on the games (it was the only windows pc in the office).

No idea what made me do it, but I decided to use the Internet to look for digimon stuff (I was like 12). Cue nervously sitting there whilst the dial up modem screamed out its tones. Dad didn't hear or didn't care, so I continued, and after a while I accidentally bookmarked a page.

So I go to bookmarks, and find an odd-looking link. Curious teen I am, I clicked it, turns out my Dad's boss was gay, and it was a gay porn site's front page. I figured if there was guys there must be girls, and so did a search...I don't know if there were free sites around in those days, but I looked at the front page teaser pictures LOADS.

Can't remember exactly how long I continually snuck up there after office hours, but I do remember being asked by Dad to accompany him into his boss' office one day- that's right, dial up modem = print-out of websites visited on the bill. I wasn't exactly told off, just told not to use someone else's property (especially one that costs) without permission.

TL;DR, my first was on my Dad's boss' pc. </TEXT>

That said, whilst it wasn't exactly groundbreaking, the Pokemon music will always live on in my heart as one of the most iconic. The original Pokemon Centre music, or the Route 1 walking music. </TEXT>

A lot of people linearly categorise male sexual feelings with the penis but, whilst I do love it being attended to, it's not the only part of my body!

Massage, stroking, tickling, licking, kissing, nibbling pretty much anywhere on my body is great- it's the attention that turns me on most. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> To answer the question, i'd say talk to him about it. Or get your brother to, it'd be less squeamish for him if it was mano el mano.

But yeah, don't do it as a confrontation (because, as you stated, everyone has a curious streak, especially at that age), just stress the cleanliness/hygiene side of things, and if you want to/feel comfortable doing so, drop in the line about being willing to buy him something of his own.

Make it casual, above all else, as I can think of nothing that would be worse (for him or you) than you coming down like a tonne of bricks on him about it.
