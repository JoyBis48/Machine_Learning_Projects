	<TEXT> Breakfast has been my main downfall in my diet. I wake up at 6am, and I don't have very much time, or motivation to make breakfast at that time, so I grab something quick like cookies and milk, or a toaster strudel. 

I don't like the food TBH, and I want to eat something healthier, but can't think of anything that won't take long and much effort to prepare. What do you eat for breakfast? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Spigot will give you a performance boost, but it won't be something crazy. Using flatfiles is generally better than sql databases, and you get better performance with them.

Performance is hugely based on the way your plugins are coded. If you have anything custom coded by an inexperienced deceloper, that may be your biggest performance hit.

	<TEXT> Well then... locking have failed miserably... coyotes for example are 1k certs, but obviously any new player can afford those...

New players don't learn shit from lockons, and when aces use them, we shit on every newbie pilot either way.

All lockons should simply be removed from the game. That's it... removed :O

	<TEXT> I don't understand how the SOE dev team works.... When the majority of pilots complain about something being broken, like a2a missles, or coyotes, nothing happens, yet when a minority or majority of ignorant infantry complain about something like the banshee, it is immediately nerfed?

The air game has been shit forever.... The constant gank squads of 4-5 ESFs running lockons ruins the experience, not to mention the fact that AA can kill an ESF as fast as an assault rifle can kill infantry. Why are the real problems being ignored?

Its a problem on every server, and on every continent, yet appeasing infantry is more imporant than fixing 1/3 of the game. The pilots have been ignored, are being ignored, and will be ignored. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Why does it make sense that ESF's die faster than infantry in 24-48 fights? Why cannot pilots enjoy battles too? I understand that from an infantry point of view ESFs can be OP if there is only 1 person trying to counter 2-3 of them, but 1 burster max can easily scare away if not kill a solo ESF.

G2A locks only kill a2a pilots trying to kill ground farmers. Maybe I should try farming the ground instead of going for enemy ESF's? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I started to write a nice little thread, pointing out the flaws and possible solutions to the problem with AA not just from the perspective of a pilot, but of an average infantry player, and I realize there is no point.

I challenge any game developer to pull an ESF, and attempt to engage anything within 1 hex of a 48+ fight. Oh, and maintain a KDR of at least 1 for 1 hr.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Since the release of directives this problem seems to have increased. The last person to do damage to a target should not get the kill. I propose that the player who did the most damage to the target gets the kill.

Why wasn't this the system in place since the beginning? </TEXT>
