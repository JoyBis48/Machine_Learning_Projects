	<TEXT> My suggestion isn't new. Theodore Roosevelt was the first to suggest testing as a requirement of government service during the late 1890s. Prior to testing, when a new republican/democratic legislation came to power, the winners handed out government positions as a reward system. The system meant the US government operated with the same level of dysfunction on display in New Orleans when G.W. Bush's buddy "Brownie" was in charge. Roosevelt adopted tests that are still given to federal workers today to assess their fitness for the position, thus doing away with the cronyism that limited government's functionality. My argument is that we need another method to assess the next level of government - our legislators. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Again, the test I'm proposing is along the lines of an elementary school civics test, which asks basic questions about the country we live in. Reviewing the responses to this question, I spot many "apologists" for politicians, along with the "I have a right to elect wealthy, stupid people" crowd. Someone even declared it a poll tax, while ignoring that the people elected to congress are some of the wealthiest in the land. With the amount of testing expected of our children, politicians argue that testing is the only way of knowing whether they are learning. Why should I expect less from a more important institution? </TEXT>

Legislators appear to have no problem forcing drug tests onto welfare recipients, they should have no problem undergoing the same process. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This joke was told to me by a female server I worked with in a downtown Denver restaurant/bar.  
  
A guy is fucking his girlfriend in the missionary position but instead of showing any reaction, she just lays there, not moving. Starting to get angry, he flips her over on her stomach and starts really pounding her doggy style, but again she doesn't move. Now really upset, the guy shoves it in her backdoor while redoubling his efforts, but to no avail. After finishing, the guy rolls off his girlfriend who looks at him and said, "That was really presumptuous of you."  
  
"Presumptuous?," he repeated.  
  
"Yes," she said, "it was presumptuous of you to put it in my butt hole."  
  
"Presumptuous," he repeated again. "That's a pretty big word for a twelve-year-old." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The most gruesome thing I've ever seen is actually a compilation of two events by the same person. I grew up in a very rural southern area and one of our neighbors was an alcoholic. One summer day he was drunk and decided to commit suicide by placing a shotgun against his chest and pulling the trigger while sitting on the sofa in his living room. The blast left big chunks of the guy's chest and back on the wall behind him, but it didn't kill him. Following the trail of blood around the house, he got up from the couch, went into the kitchen and got another beer, then drank it at the kitchen table. Next, he went upstairs, sat on the edge of his bed for a while, before wandering back downstairs to the couch where he passed out. The crazy thing is that he survived.  
  
Fast forward a couple of years and I'm now a sophomore in high school. Our neighbor has been caught so many times driving drunk that he's spent a year in jail, and lost his driving privileges along with his car. This doesn't slow my neighbor down one little bit as he has purchased a really nice riding lawnmower, removed its governor, and it now can reach speeds of up to 15mph. We lived on a gravel/dirt road with really heavy traffic and people loved to drive fast on it. One morning I'm on the school bus as we start the fifteen mile trip to our high school. I hear a shriek from a girl at the front of the bus, and the breaking bus threw me into the seat back. I looked out the window where the other kids were pointing and draped across a tree branch was our neighbor, twisted and dead. They found his riding lawnmower in the deep grass beyond the road. A man later came forward who said he knew he'd hit something but didn't know what. He assumed it was a deer that had survived the impact and run off because the lawnmower was hidden by the deep grass. He didn't see a body, of course, because it'd been thrown into and caught by tree branches. Seeing the results of this man's suicidal behavior twice left me with a propensity for nausea at meals that my brothers exploited viciously.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When I was ten-years-old someone abandoned their dog near our rural Tennessee home. My dad worked two jobs and refused to allow the family to have a dog because he considered them too expensive. I knew that my dad would think we encouraged the dog to stay, and punish us with whippings using his belt. In order to avoid this, I took the dog deep into the woods around our house. I placed it on the center of a very old bed sheet by telling it to sit and it obeyed with heart-breaking enthusiasm. I then took the .22 caliber rifle I'd brought along, and put a bullet between the dog's eyes. I'm still horrified and haunted by what I did that day, but I'm even angrier that poverty and my dad's adherence to a brutal religiosity placed a ten-year-old me into such a despicable situation. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Name calling is the last bastion of a losing argument. You concentrate only on "fundamentalists" as the bad lot while my argument is that religion in every form is inherently repressive, especially to those who aren't members. Several good examples of this are the current battles in the US being fought over access to abortion, and same-sex marriage. Remove religion from the argument and there is no opposition. Because of some stupid beliefs begun thousands of years earlier, large segments of the female US population live without access to life saving abortions, and same-sex couples can't enjoy the same legal protections as their heterosexual counterparts.  
  
If you're going to respond further, let me ask just one question. What unique quality did Judaism have that was lacking in all the other religions prior to its inception? What set it apart from all other religions? As Neil deGrasse Tyson repeatedly points out, it's okay not to know the answer. No one has all the answers. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Another ad hominem argument, so you didn't really learn anything at all.  
  
We are only going to continue talking past one another because we see the world in very different ways. I learned this from my oldest brother who is a preacher at a Church of Christ denomination in the american south. He saw the world through the lenses of "god" while my vision was obscured by my "godlessness." His conclusion came after I'd asked too many "unfair" questions concerning his beliefs. The most offensive question was "what is a day to god." He firmly believes in creationism as presented in the "bible" that is limited to six days with a seventh day for rest. His "god" just happened to follow the cycle of our planet's daily revolution. But to claim that this information is correct means understanding the mind of his "god", something that is supposed to be unknowable. Religious people are annoyed by these contradictions when they're pointed out.  
  
The same problem applies to our conversation. You are willing to allow specious claims based on your religious views, and participate in a form of suspension of disbelief that might be called "faith". I don't share this predilection for applying "faith" based on the observance of a set of rules formed by individuals who lived thousands of years ago. In its purest form, religions are a method to control and funnel the hopes and fears of a downtrodden portion of the world's population. It banks on the the promise of an afterlife of paradise for a chosen few. I know this is the only life available to me and I refuse to waste it propping up the beliefs of an elitist few.  </TEXT>

I don't care what your interpretation of a religious text entails, they're all fantasy to me. Israel finds it acceptable to target women and children during wartime operations, while ISIS chooses its own targets according to religion and prefers beheadings over bombs. Both are dispicable courses of action, but met with approval by each religions' adherents. I see no distinction between the horrors visited upon those within each sects' religious boundaries. So defend blind adherence to your religion, but don't ask me to validate it. </TEXT>

Respecting your beliefs mean I also must respect those who believe in stoning and decapitating people. It means respecting ridiculous beliefs put forward in any form of a "holy book" whether it's called a koran, bible, etc. Here's my advice: Don't blindly follow any ideology that resists being questioned or criticized, because it's the result of another person's thinking. Think for yourself, use reasoning and objectivity (two qualities religion lacks) to guide you, and reserve respect for that which deserves it. Live on your own terms. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was wondering this myself. My dad is a deeply religious man who believed people had forgotten the true meaning of the holiday. As a family, we stopped giving presents or putting up decorations when I was a ten-year-old. Looking back, I now believe our family was too poor to afford the gift-giving aspect of the holiday and he used religion as an excuse. Today, the holiday has no meaning for me, especially now that I avoid religion. Friends get mad at me for refusing their gifts, but I just don't want to participate in what's essentially become an orgy of consumerism. My attitude often worked against me because I waited tables a good portion of my life in an upscale restaurant located in a five-star hotel that remained open 365 days a year. Guess who always got stuck working alone on xmas. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Race has long played a role in housing restrictions, both in Europe and the Americas. These books explore the myriad ways local, state, and federal governments implemented policies that were driven by business interests. Two organizations performed dominate roles in policy creation - the United States Chamber of Commerce, and the National Association of Realtors. Both are lobbying groups with incredible power, but together they created the process of redlining and restrictive covenants. These practices assured white homeowners within the redlined districts or under covenants that the neighborhood would remain white. Participating homeowners could not sell their homes to anyone deemed unsuitable, to include just about all immigrants or AA. This meant our cities were incredibly stratified by race, with AA being forced into the most rundown and neglected neighborhoods by these restrictions and the cost of rents. As a consequence, the white business and political communities would point to the ruin and use it as an excuse as to why the two races could never co-mingle, ignoring the fact that local government policies gave AA nowhere else to live.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I can reply to the OP as a historian, and since one of the replies mentions Detroit, I'll suggest one of urban historians' favorite books: Sugrue, Thomas. The Origins of the Urban Crisis : Race and Inequality in Postwar Detroit. Princeton  N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1996.  
  
Sugrue tracks the decline of Detroit and places the blame squarely on the city's political and economic elite who promoted racist policies that promoted the ghettoization of African Americans in small clusters while whites fled to the suburbs. This is a matter repeated across american cities and I'll provide more books that address this subject:

All of these texts reveal the persistence of local government in creating policies that marginalized AA or the poor using housing as an instrument in erecting boundaries designed to keep the elite shielded from the poor. Again, this trend has reversed with rising rents pushing the poor and minorities out of cities and into the suburban landscape. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Religion - it is the evilest invention of humanity. It stifles free thinking, promotes prejudice through difference, and its adherents' claims of moral superiority are ridiculous. For close to 1500 years it kept humanity in a state of intellectual decay that still persists. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Please understand that I didn't mean you're "all wrong" because that's not my intention. I'm sure there are a plethora of smart redditors, including yourself, but crowd sourcing the understanding of America's constitution is a risky way to get that information. For example, an individual may know a lot about performing surgery from reading literature about the subject, and even be able to speak the jargon. However, having never performed surgery, would you want this individual opening you up? It's simple for a person to regurgitate information that they learned on the history channel or discovery channel (both are horrible sources), even perhaps on wikapedia, but it's an understanding that's usually ideologically driven by the source, and is suspect. I'm also saying that american media has failed its audience because it no longer informs or challenges the prevailing dogma of contemporary political parties. In many instances a "news" channel will deliberately misinform its viewers to elicit a particular reaction. With such odds stacked against the average american it's no wonder they are poorly informed about their constitutional rights.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This will sound cruel, but that's the problem today with our population's understanding of government. We want the condensed version of things because we're overworked and find our downtime better spent on having fun. I challenge you to dig deeper, because when the light finally comes on in your head, your understanding of the protections offered by our Constitution will result in a feeling of disappointment at where our leaders have taken this country in the past twenty-five years. I am a professional historian so if you'd like a complete list of books on this subject I'd be glad to provide it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> To understand an inkling of the Constitution's authors intent requires reading a historiography on the subject.  
  
A good starting point is Peter H. Irons. A Peoples History of the Supreme Court. New York: Viking, 1999. Irons points out that the US was founded on the notion of law, but it was a law interpreted by the white, wealthy, landholding men, the majority of which were lawyers. The overwhelming problem facing the new government was slavery. "It seemed now to be pretty well understood," Madison said, "that the real difference of interest lay, not between the large and small but between the northern and southern states. The institution of slavery and its consequences formed the line of discrimination." For those who don't know, Madison was the only individual to keep complete notes about the process from start to finish. He was also the engine that drove the process, while Jefferson wasn't even there. He was serving as a diplomat in France when the Constitution was written. Madison's notes were not released until after all the participating members died. From these notes we know that "wealth" was used as an euphemism to describe slaves. His notes reveal the debate about just who should be allowed to vote in this new country. "The delegates argued about who should be allowed to vote in elections, because among the landed classes, those without lands were considered too ignorant to be trusted with voting. To alleviate their fears, the delegates decided that the state's legislators would choose the two members of the Senate, a rule that finally changed in 1913."(p 26)  
  
If we still followed the founders' thinking on government, a much smaller portion of the population would be allowed to vote. I offer this example to highlight that the Constitution's authors were imperfect men who tried to create a form of government that incorporated methods to change or amend the document as the nation grew. Those that argue we should adhere to their founding vision overlook the myopic nature of that vision. Additionally, injecting economic visions on the Constitution's authors is incredibly short sighted as the contemporary economic business model of capitalism was still sixty years away, and they had no idea how it would impact Americans.  </TEXT>
