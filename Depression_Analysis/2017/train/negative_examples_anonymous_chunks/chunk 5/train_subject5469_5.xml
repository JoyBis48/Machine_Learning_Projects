	<TEXT> The type is not the same and the flag bars are distressed on the target one. The colors are the same, but printing white on Black is very common.

Wow.. so this means [I could distress these circles a bit, switch up the font by a hairsbreadth](http://i00.i.aliimg.com/wsphoto/v1/1604256868/Factory-directly-selling-Captain-America-superhero-tee-shirt-font-b-avengers-b-font-font-b-sign.jpg), print this shirt and sell it without license from Marvel Comics! It's just some generic circles and triangles.

 Creative directors (in my experience) are middle managers that know nothing about design.

Well just call me a unicorn. My experience is in the material arts in the 80's, graphic arts in the mid 90's, digital design experience leading to the founding 2 graphic arts and web design companies in NY. During this period I was a contracted as a writer and graphic arts developer for Jupiter Media (Graphics.com) and started designing advertising and developing marketing programs for the Palms in Vegas, among others. 

Then got an offer as Executive Creative Director with a company on the west coast. 

An Executive Creative Director that doesn't know design is like a doctor that doesn't know anatomy.

	<TEXT> The ones on high horses were the ones attacking this woman and casting unfounded and unreasonable accusations at her, when she was obviously wronged.

Coincidence? Did you even bother to go read the news articles or [look at the image](http://www.opposingviews.com/i/social/oregon-woman-finds-her-t-shirt-design-sold-target-without-her-permission)? It's exact. 

I isolated the design and did a google image compare: there are no designs out there exactly like this besides the one at Target. 

And 'it happens' is no excuse when fucking with someones livelihood. Kicking someone when they are already down, from the safety of your keyboard anonymity, is cowardly and horrendous.

It's' also clear to me that the design is copyrighted to her under the electronic copyright act.

	<TEXT> Like the young woman yesterday who had her best selling t-shirt design obviously and without doubt being printed and sold by Target.

 Redditors viciously attacked her, attacked the design as 'ugly' and 'unoriginal' (as if their fine sense of aesthetics mattered), attacked everyone selling on Etsy, attacked Etsy itself, claimed repeatedly that she didn't have a leg to stand on (when attorneys in the news articles that said she *did* have a case). 

Worst of all the top poster, doing the usual shitty job of playing reddit detective, claimed that she ripped off the Tootsie Roll Indian (on another shirt). That design is actually over 80 yrs old and has been in public domain for years. Despite this being pointed out, hundreds of neck bearded assholes jumped on the bandwagon, calling her a thief and worse. They were so horrible that she literally pulled that shirt from her store. 

This lady is supporting her kids from her screen printing operation in her garage. And these fuckwads attacked her - viciously. 

For what? Being female? Starting her own business? For doing more with her life than whacking it in moms basement? It was inexcusable and inexplicable. You would have thought half the commenters worked for Target. I am wondering if it ended up having a negative impact on her livelihood. 

I am just about fucking done. </TEXT>

The results of this was [horrifying for south america and us](https://youtu.be/azYxPf_Ahp4). That song was written by Bruce after visiting SA during the wars being brought there from the US. Some surviving villagers told him of the villages people being locked into their church and it being set on fire- children and old people to burning alive. We brought utter hell down on those people - and it was Reagans boys who did it.

There certainly weren't enough people on earth when it was written to have a huge environmental impact. That is why it fascinates me. Because now we do have enough people and are having a drastic impact. 

Strong's Concordance states the translation for 'earth' basically means: 4a) the earth as opposed to the heavens

Obviously I didn't ask for a selfie.

18 years ago the use of the term 'merica' was unheard of as well as the use of a hashtag.

I am familiar with US design copyright law having known a person who did a design for fabric wall hanging sales- and found her design on an online poster sale site - a clear rip - just as what happened here.

 She did sue successfully. Hopefully this woman will be successful as well.  </TEXT>

It depends - you want a shirt that lasts a few months or a few years?

If you read the article or watched the ABC news video you would see that her t-shirts are individually screen printed by hand using  high-end inks on t-shirts with a much higher thread count than Targets. In other words- her shirts will last much longer than Targets.

	<TEXT> We have a woman successfully supporting her children by creating designs (whether it's to your taste or not doesn't matter) and screen printing them, individually, by hand, in her garage. Then selling them on an online outlet. 

We have a multi-billion dollar, multinational corporation finding the design, probably using [one of the sites that lists the top selling items on Etsy](http://www.handmadeology.com/top-100-handmade-etsy-sellers-2014-by-number-of-sales/), copying it and profiting by selling it nationwide. 

What is your 'Case in point' that makes the small business owner wrong and subject to ridiculous attacks while reddit absolves the multinational corporation? I really want to see it. 

Obviously she is protected by law against this sort of thing. Or did Target send some PR teams in to lead this circle jerk attacking her, attacking Etsy and even attacking Etsy sellers? It won't be the first time a major corporation has manipulated reddit. 

Electronic copyright law says she is protected.

What the fuck? We had a band complaining last week about a web magazine that posted their music video without attribution and Reddit was up in arms about it.

Now we have a multinational corporate box store stealing this persons design and selling it nationwide, at a profit, and the 'top' posters on the Reddit story are excoriating and attacking:

a. The person who made the design, 

b. the design itself (as if personal sense of taste mattered to the story), 

c. her online sales outlet (as if that mattered),

d. and all of the other small business people who sell on this sales outlet.

What the heck ?

Are redditors now commonly, en-mass, protecting multinational corporations over the average, hard working person in American who is trying to develop their own business? 

Or are there a bunch of pro Corporate, anti-small business PR people sent to reddit to lead the conversation and up-down votes on stories that make the front page?

This rabid reaction makes absolutely no sense otherwise. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Testing of Your Faith

2 Count it all joy, my brothers,[b] when you meet trials of various kinds, 3 for you know that the testing of your faith produces steadfastness. 4 And let steadfastness have its full effect, that you may be perfect and complete, lacking in nothing.

5 If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask God, who gives generously to all without reproach, and it will be given him. 6 *But let him ask in faith, with no doubting, for the one who doubts is like a wave of the sea that is driven and tossed by the wind. 7 For that person must not suppose that he will receive anything from the Lord; 8 he is a double-minded man, unstable in all his ways.*

9 Let the lowly brother boast in his exaltation, 10 and the rich in his humiliation, because like a flower of the grass[c] he will pass away. 11 *For the sun rises with its scorching heat and withers the grass; its flower falls, and its beauty perishes. So also will the rich man fade away in the midst of his pursuits.*

12 Blessed is the man who remains steadfast under trial, for when he has stood the test he will receive the crown of life, which God has promised to those who love him. 13 Let no one say when he is tempted, I am being tempted by God, for God cannot be tempted with evil, and he himself tempts no one. 14 *But each person is tempted when he is lured and enticed by his own desire. 15 Then desire when it has conceived gives birth to sin, and sin when it is fully grown brings forth death.*

https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James+1 version=ESV

16 Do not be deceived, my beloved brothers. 17 Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights with whom there is no variation or shadow due to change.[d] 18 Of his own will he brought us forth by the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I live in a rather bohemian city (very small) in the mountains. This was a new, small business- so I decided to go there in support. We do crazy liberal stuff like that. 

So the guy is talking about how he had a shop in L.A. but decided to move here because it was 'cooler' (literally- we are in the mountains). Then he started talking about local politics in a kind of denigrating manner (while enjoying a glass of the cleanest tap water in the US and breathing some of the cleanest air).

I just maintained a neutral face, to see how far he would go. He apparently took that for acquiescence and said something about how we needed to get rid of all those 'hippies' to "change the liberal politics 'round here". 

Despite the fact that those 'hippies' are the ones bringing in entertainment, creating businesses, painting cool murals, holding art events, fairs and farmers markets, promoting local growth and keeping out the big box stores- everything that brings people here in droves to drop a lot of money into the local economy.

And so I knew where he was going from there - and I was done. </TEXT>

Also remember flying on a taxi bird to Winterspring and saw below this giant flame dog farting and belching smoke and flame. I rode back to where I had seen it and all of a sudden there was this boss, Kruul, walking toward town. Called on guilds and we took him on, about 20 of us. Wiped us completely out. So we called on some more people and ended up in a 40man competition raid with the Horde to see who got him first. 

We wiped-

Present day sample: My great great Uncle [Harry 'Slim' Sallee](http://sabr.org/bioproj/person/f5ef8e5d). Pitcher for Reds, Cardinals and finally for the Giants during the 1917 World Series 'Black Sox' Scandal. [His picture.](http://i.imgur.com/nACpt.jpg)

Slim barely spent a calm, normal day of his life. Constantly in trouble from the day he was born:

When the routine of practice got too strenuous, Sallee would leave St. Louis' League Park and walk across the street to a social club known as the "Grass Eaters", housed only 100 feet away from the clubhouse. Sallee often "exercised his rights as a member" of this social club. One clubhouse boy said that during games Sallee would lower a bucket over the fence on a rope to a confederate who would fill it (with beer) at the social club.

The players were not allowed to drink, by contract. But Harry would tell stories of being hung out of hotel rooms by the other players, run to a bar and get liquor and come back to the hotel and climb up bedsheets to the room.

One note- Poverty is the living, breathing proof of failure of the political and corporate system in a country. To set people up to blame the poor is absolving the politicians and corporate heads of their failure. Don't do it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Here is another one. [This was hysterically funny.](http://i.imgur.com/eA2QeC0.jpg)

When they first made snowballs in the game the targeted toon would flip over onto it's back. Everyone loved them. 

Also, as I discovered when my friends and I went to have a snowball fight on the SW/IF Tram, snowballs travelled at exactly the same speed as the tram. So the result was that once everyone got off the tram they would be hit by every snowball thrown at them during the ride. 

BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM - the target would be doing flips in the air, totally stun-locked.

So we would lurk around the station, wait till some poor, unsuspecting player got on, get on the last tram car and start pelting snowballs at them. I'm laughing right now thinking about it. 

Also we discovered that if you threw a snowball at a target at the moment they mounted a taxi bird, the snowballs would hit them as soon as they landed - anywhere. 

And blizzard stopped it.. such a bummer. </TEXT>

My second toon I made a few months after beta -she ended up being a 19 twink and had her little rogue partner (usually my daughter or hubby at the helm of that one.)

Best story I have is;

"Back in the day, mages had unlimited sheeps on the battleground. You also had set battlegroups and would regularly play against the same players.

One day this Troll was speed hacking (a method where they would dc quickly/repeatedly and lag the game for other players) and we caught him alone in a hut on WSG. So I repeat sheeped his ass in the hut while my rogue partner stunlocked and killed everything that tried to come rescue him. 

We laughed ourselves into hysterics. 

Next time we encountered him we did the same thing. From then on out - until they changed the battlegroup system, it was game-on between me and him in every bg we ended up in together.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am not referring to the 'floating dead' aspect. I am referring to the lack of education, regulation and poverty that let's this continue.

Corporate/Banking groups (mostly multinationals now) are spending millions lobbying for low wages, ending the EPA, ending pollution regulations, ending work safety regulations, destroying what is left of labor power, ending supplemental health care, etc.

This is all part of the "Make gub'ment smaller!" movement.

The result of this, if they are successful, is exactly what you see in India and Bangladesh. Very few ultra rich at the top, wholly unregulated (who never see these streets) and masses of people in poverty.

EDIT: If you have an alternate point to make, man up and debate this instead of dv it.

	<TEXT> Everything you said, and:

Second, ungate professions. Put fixed gem slots back on gear. Give us our enchants back. I don't understand why reforging, meta gems, and most enchant slots were removed. I LIKED having to invest some time and resources into my character. These days, getting gear is boring as hell.

I will add; "Slow Down", and reserve Heirloom gear to a few slots, like trinkets, gloves and belts.

Leveling speed and ease is ridiculous. Now there is no reason to level professions, because why bother to slot a gem or enchant or make a piece of gear you or your customer will only use for a couple of hours? This also means none of the made items can sell on the AH. When leveling and moving through new areas/dungeons was challenging, these items were important. Now you never die.

So now there is no reason to revisit old raids and dungeons where rare patterns drop. Or travel to different areas to farm materials, gain various faction rep for some recipes and make special items. That's a huge chunk of the game that is just gone.

I have 10 yr old toons with enchanting, alchemy, leatherworking, who have rare and very cool old school recipes that are now worthless. There was no reason to take this away from players- and it is a slap in the face of those who have invested time and money. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Flourishing? I am ready to start inventing recipes. Shrimp Chips, anyone? 

I am not sure. This is a non co2, planted tank that has an Eco Complete substrate (20b) layered with some natural sand / dirt from the river out back (Sierra glacial stream) + fluorite (20lb). 

ph 7. Other parameters good. Temp around 77-78. 10-15% water change once a week or so. I use a little flourish once a month + plant tabs at base of larger plants. 

I have several different kinds of mosses- normal java moss, subwassertang and some mini fissidens that I got to attach to the castle roof.

They eat whatever they can scavenge plus 3 algae tabs 2-3x a week. Wardley Pleco tabs- aspirin sized ones. 

The shrimp were a couple of baby hitchhikers that came in on a little bundle of plants. Took me a while to figure out where they came from.

Now I have a colony in my low tech 29 bowfront. Must have hitchhiked over when I was moving / trimming plants. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The top line (8 degrees) is if we do nothing at all.

The other two values (2 and 4 degrees) are what we get with slowing and stopping carbon fuel burning combined with a massive, global geoengineering program to recapture CO2 using technology that hasn't been invented yet. 

None of these take methane release due to melt or any other feedback mechanism into account.

 In Russia there comes the hope of the world, not as that sometimes termed of the communistic, or Bolshevik, no; but freedom, freedom! That each man will live for his fellow man! The principle has been born. It will take years for it to be crystallised, but out of Russia comes again the hope of the world. (1944) No. 3976-29

Now when he spoke this and even when I read it (in the 70's) Russia was the great evil on the earth.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi. The 'lacy' moss is plain Java moss tied on with cotton thread. By the time the cotton rots away the moss is imbedded on the driftwood. The little grassy plant is a micro sword. 

The floating plants are common duckweed (Lemnia Minor) and Miniature Water Lettuce (Pistea). The water lettuce has the longer roots. 

Red plant- as long as lighting and fert. requirements are met, Alternanthera Reineckii var. mini is nice. If it gets too big just trim it. I have the large type in the big tank. Another option is a mini Cryptocoryne. They tend to be more brown than red usually.

The thing with red plants is the proper fertilizer balance to maintain the color. 

Also- none of my tanks have Co2. I cover them during the day with fitted plexiglass and run a light bubbler at night.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Anubias are low light plants. Even though some lights look bright to the human eye, the key for plants is the correct spectrum. This is also a very deep tank, which is going to make a big difference on your lighting needs. 

Also Anubias don't need the correct strata for rooting. 

If you want a planted tank, a few suggestions.

Make sure you have the correct base for them to root in.

Research lighting and apply it (could be a bit expensive).

Research fertilizers and apply. (also slightly expensive).

Don't keep soft plant eating fish if you want plants such as anacharis. 

You can never add too many plants at once. Stock it up. 

10 hours of lighting will lead to an algae nightmare. No more than 5 hours of correct spectrum lighting a day. 

Otherwise you can stick with low light plants, such as anubias. Research low light plants if you plan on only having two tubes on the tank. 

Definitely change out your bulbs for a plant spectrum bulbs, regardless. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Here's the deal with 'hungry' fish. Since they have to hunt for food most of their waking hours (in the wild) just to stay alive, they do not have a 'shut off' switch in their brain telling them that they are 'full' -like humans do. They don't need one. 

Since you are artificially feeding them please ignore the begging if you know they are actually eating every day. Check bellies after dinner. Unfortunately, consistent food begging by fish has killed more than I like to think about.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Do you have a water softener?

One thing you can do is add a very small piece of (dead and bleached) branching coral to the tank to add a bit more naturally dissolved calcium. About an inch per 10g. You can also add a level teaspoon of pure epsom salts per 20g. This can help with snails with thin shells as well. Just keep an eye on your ph. </TEXT>
