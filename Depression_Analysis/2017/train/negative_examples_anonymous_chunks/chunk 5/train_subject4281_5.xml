	<TEXT> Does the fitbit track down to the seconds of elevated hr or just by a minute? If it tallied all the seconds through the day I had my hr Up I'd be intrigued. But if you have to be active for at least a minute to trigger it that's less interesting </TEXT>

	<TITLE> What's the difference between a fitbit and a heart rate monitor if all I want it to do is give me real time heart rate throughout my run? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> I don't care about logging or stats, I just want a real time (to where I don't have to hold a button) accurate view of my heart rate at all times on my wrist while I run.

I got a heart rate monitor with a chest strap at Walmart for 50 bucks. Is it not as accurate as the fitbit which is way more expensive? What's so special about the fitbit? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> If we evolved from single celled organisms to the massive collections of organisms we are today, maybe we'll eventually evolve to be the size of solar systems </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> To put in perspective, a single celled organism can be as small as .1 microns per Google, and a human is 6 feet. 

Using this scale, a .1 micron organism to a 6 foot human is the equivalent of a 6 foot human to something 20,000 miles long.

I realize a solar system is way longer than that, but I wonder if we could eventually multiply to that size or beyond given infinite time.

	<TEXT> Tbh I didn't think it was that clever of a thing. I just figured neckbeards would get a kick out of knowing people played d d in basic. 

That being said I don't care if I posted that I have a 10 inch dick and took a picture of it, if people enjoyed it and upvoted it then I feel no shame or regrets.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For those wondering, the drill sgt shouted this at me when he got to me during the inspection.

Army pt shorts have tiny pockets so this was my only option. I ran out with shoes but no socks on thinking it was better to be chewed out for having socks in my waistband than to be late to formation and/or not have them at all.
