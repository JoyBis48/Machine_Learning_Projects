	<TEXT> I am not sorry that President Obama has ordered drone strikes on hundreds of terrorist suspects hiding in Pakistan, Yemen and other places. **I am not sorry he has done so despite the fact that the strikes inevitably have killed hundreds and perhaps thousands of their associates, many of whom were either innocent of wrongdoing or had committed no crime** deserving of death from 30,000 feet. This is the nature of war. </TEXT>

In 2004, Perry refused to temporarily stay Willinghams execution despite the report of a leading forensic expert that sharply disputed the finding of arson by a Texas deputy fire marshal. Perrys administration has also repeatedly undercut the authority of a state Forensic Science Commission, which agreed that the arson finding relied on flawed analysis. Defending his handling of the case in 2009, the governor declared that Willingham was a monster. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Slater was reminded of his own vulnerability after an army fuel truck came rumbling down a highway ramp, crossed the median and rolled over a civilian hatchback. Dispatched to the scene to do the recovery work, the Marines found themselves completely exposed. The night was clear, the lights of Fallujah shone brightly in the distance, the moon was full and insurgents could easily pick them off with sniper fire or a bomb detonated on the road underneath. Meanwhile, the hatchback had been crushed to a height of inches, and **the Marines were tasked with extracting what was left of the Iraqi mother and child inside.** </TEXT>

1.  U.S. "officers" rather than "Special Ops Commando" and "CIA agent."

It just seems to me that that headline was written by someone who is interested in developing a certain storyline. Or, maybe it's just a really bad headline... </TEXT>
