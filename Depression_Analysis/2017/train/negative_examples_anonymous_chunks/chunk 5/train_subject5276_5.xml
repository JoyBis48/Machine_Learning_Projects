	<TEXT> Firstly, i know thats not how heightdata works, its just a basic placeholder so i know where i will eventually put them, and build around them and not worry about elevation. And thanks for the additional tips, ill be sure to keep them in mind </TEXT>

	<TITLE> 'Molunova' DayZ/ArmA 3 map idea progression </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-12-31 04:25:21 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So i have added some new ideas to my map (it is still just a drawing that i have moved from paint into paint.net to allow me to have more freedom to do assorted things) First, some 'story' about parts of the map. the northern most city, "North City" has a tall wall going around the surrounding area. Players will need special clothes in order to survive the radiation of north city for more than a minute. North City will have lots of military loot and will (hopefully) be a hotspot for players to go to to get good gear. This idea isn't even 10% done, so any feedback would be highly appreciated.

	<TEXT> The terrain is a 70% replication of the island of Ireland, rotated 90* to the left. I have some basic ideas on where mountains will be, but haven't given much thought into choke points yet. no cities or towns have been added yet, as i am having trouble designing them </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So i gave up on making the design for this map awhile ago, but recently started working on it again. Here is the basic drawing: http://imgur.com/lWDKGJp Each square is 1 Km by 1 Km, at the longest points it is 14 Km horizontally, and 12 Km vertically. Soon i will add mountains and elevation lines. all feedback is wanted. </TEXT>
