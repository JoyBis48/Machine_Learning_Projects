	<TEXT> I can verify this. I work in a freezer, temps are between -10 and -25 degrees Fahrenheit. Years back when my hands would get unbearably cold I would rush to the bathroom and run them under hot water, then a few minutes later they would be in throbbing pain. I was told to not do that because it causes nerve damage over time. Cold slowly to warm is what to do.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  I often have dreams in which I cannot tell whether they happened or were dreamed. Usually these dreams were preceded by a night of drinking, albeit sometimes not much drinking, but drinking none the less. If not maybe ask a doctor, or perhaps before you go to sleep write in a journal of your day and person to person encounters. Then keep a separate journal for when you wake up to report your Dreams/false memories and compare the two. Good luck, I hope it's nothing serious. </TEXT>

And yes NotHimAgain I will agree, Superjail was awesome and way grosser than this Korgoth show. But in its own special way, Korgoth of Barbaria is a medieval Superjail.  </TEXT>
