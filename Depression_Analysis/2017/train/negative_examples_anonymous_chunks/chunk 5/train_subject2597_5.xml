Before I get downvoted to the depths of hell, who wants to place a wager? If Sanders wins the primary, I'll donate $25 (I'm a broke college student and Sanders likes small donations) to his campaign. If he doesn't make it, $25 will be donated to the GOP that wins the primary by whoever takes me up on this. 

Edit- wow I would've expected someone to take me up on this by now. I guess Sanders supporters aren't as confident as they appear  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Nothing about academics? 
I think they were generous on basketball. CSU lost the best players from last year if I remember correctly and that year was an outlier. They complain about being snubbed and then lose in the first NIT round. That's just poor attitude. Colorado was snubbed a few years ago then  lost in the NIT semis. To prevent being snubbed they won the pac tournament the following year. 
Geography gave me a laugh. Yes Colorado boarders a big 12 state and used to be a big 12 state, but it's not any easy drive. It's 8 hours of boring flat land from Kansas. I think CU BIG 12 history is the only reason geography was scored so high.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I never heard about the tournament until this year, perhaps someone could explain it more. Colorado has an alumni team, games start July 10th and Colorado plays July 11th. Games are live streamed with the final 17 being shown on ESPN U, and the last 3 games on ESPN.
Colorado roster includes Beau Gamble, Jeremy Adams, Sabatino Chen, to name a few. 
Winning team gets $1,000,000 and registered fans get prizes ranging from a t-shirt to $5,000.  </TEXT>
