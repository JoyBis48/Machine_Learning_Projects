	<TEXT> Driving in San Francisco is HORRIBLE! There are one way streets everywhere. If you miss your turn or your entrance to the grocery store, you have to go up two more blocks, turn left, get on the highway, merge to a different Highway, take the exit, and left turn, just to get to the turn that was 3 feet behind you. Not to mention... It's all uphill  </TEXT>
