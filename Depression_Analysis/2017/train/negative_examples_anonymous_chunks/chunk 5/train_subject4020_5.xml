	<TEXT> Teamviewer. Free remote desktop connection, and they have a mobile app, so you can control your pc from your phone. I spent a lot of money on building a nice desktop, and just remote to it from a cheap netbook or my android phone whenever I need it. Teamviewer is probably the most important free software I've ever used! The app has come a long way, I find the interface extremely logical and easy to use, you can also transfer files and it's just the best. </TEXT>
