	<TEXT> That puts my mind to a lot of rest. I've been obsessed with Yoji Shinkawa. He's the kind of artist i don't think anyone can ever accurately emulate. I feel lucky even to be close enough to give him a subtle homage.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> **EDIT 2:** [Here's a link to my Society6 account](http://society6.com/Maazcon/Chemistry-Hjg_Print#1=2) for those that want to purchase it. I updated the work so it doesn't have my artist info anymore. I'm still looking for a vendor through where I can hopefully make it more affordable for you guys, so if anyone knows of a good one, let me know! Don't hesitate to send me a message if you have any questions about purchases either. If you guys just want to check out some more stuff I tend to post online, [here's my portfolio](http://mconpictures.com)

**EDIT:** I'm still not really awake at the moment because of the all-nighter I just pulled earlier, so this might all come out a bit weird. This is the first time that one of my artworks has gotten this much recognition and feedback, so I'm still in a phase of "HOLY SHIT" right now. 

I know that r/breakingbad implemented rules for artwork to be diverted to another subreddit. Since the mods do say they "may make an exception" for certain works, I wanted to take a shot at it, but this is honestly more than I could have asked for. 

For those of you asking about purchasing it, I want to try making that doable. I'll try having something set up by the end of today. I want to make sure it's in a good enough quality to be printed first, so I'm going to work on sorting that out. I do have a society6 account, but if anyone knows of another similar way to sell artwork online, let me know. I like society6, but I don't know how I feel about the prices. I want you guys to be able to buy it affordably, so I'll take the best route I can find to do that.

Seriously, the fact that there's people out there that want to own something I worked on myself is still something I'm trying to comprehend. Thanks again, everyone.


**Original post:** Yo, guys. I don't know how to say it, but thank you for the response to this, the criticism, everything. I uploaded this after finishing a 10 page essay and this is insane to wake up to after a sad attempt at two hours of sleep before class. I just keep refreshing the page right now because I honestly didn't think this would be getting hits or generating discussion at all that quickly. 


I promise i'll be responding to each one of you personally when i get out of class because you guys made my morning a lot less stressful. I feel too grateful. Thanks for all the feedback!

	<TEXT> The bulk of this was drawing Walter digitally.  I had renditions done first of him in every form of appeareance he took on. What ended up in this was mainly full on Heisenberg and Mr. Lambert. The coloration came afterward, and then I messed around (and perhaps got carried away) with layering it and distorting it from different angles. I've been obsessing over Metal Gear Solid artwork for a while now, so this got my graphic novel/cyberpunk inspiration running wild. 


Thank you so much, by the way! </TEXT>

It's a difficult task finding a way to bring the iconic "man in suit" look Godzilla's had for over 50 years, and working it into a movie that has to appeal to audiences in an age of high-budget sci-fi films focused mostly on computer generated VFX. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As a PSA for everyone, get your hands on VSCO Cam right now if you can as well. They're giving it for free because of a new update, and they have a promotional cut from $16 to $6 going on for their entire IAP bundle. It's worth shelling out the money for. The best results for me came from that app. Afterlight's been my go to editing app for a long time as well. Both are awesome.


Glad to hear they look good so far! I'm on a jailbreak and waiting for the OS to be finalized before I get it, so I was a bit nervous about how the pictures would look on iOS 7. I can't wait to see how they came out on the parallax. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you're losing interest in your own work, then you know you've been staring at them too long on your own by now. You don't even really need Reddit to start with. Show them to close friends. Post them on your social networking profiles. Feedback from good friends, family and anyone around you is a big step forward. 

Making a website to build a portfolio out of them once you've really learned a few techniques and have a few sets of photos to work off of comes later on. Post them to reddit for feedback and criticism, whereever appropriate.

[r/photography](http://reddit.com/r/photography) has some great links to tips and guides on building on your work, if you want to check it out. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I take them because I like taking them. I tried doing photography as a job, but then it just made me hate it so I stopped. Now I just carry my phone with me and capture anything I find worth shooting, and i love it. It becomes an addiction when you know you don't need an SLR to make something cool every day.


Also for karma.

[10](http://i.imgur.com/Yq8bsFS.jpg) and 12-18 were taken in Saudi Arabia. I was there last March. Some of the pictures in the album are of Masjid al-Nabawi and al-Haram, from the inside and outside. If you see the b w shot of the man walking under large umbrellas, those are put out there to keep people under the shade outside the mosque. It's amazing to see. The pictures don't do those places justice.

The shot of the [mountains](http://i.imgur.com/8eGiIvah.jpg) was taken in switzerland, somewhere in the alps. The rest were a collection of shots from Austin, San Antonio, and Dallas. Dallas is where I currently live. I'm really glad you guys like these. I'll make sure I post more soon!
