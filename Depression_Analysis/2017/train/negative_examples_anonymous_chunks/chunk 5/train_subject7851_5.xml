People need to get the idea out of their heads that hybrids are fuel economic. 

A Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV has a 30km range on the battery. Then it does about 7.32 liters per 100km on fuel.  </TEXT>

Then everything went to crap after which they elect a government so extremely far to the left that they will never resolve anything with the EU.

Then they get tricked into a false sense of importance by a referendum that is less useful than a car without wheels.

	<TEXT> Greece would to well to make their country a good place to settle as a company. Make labour laws more entrepreneur friendly, reduce the ridiculous worker rights the Greek people have been giving themselves (really, it's out of hand). Make it a beneficial place tax wise (corporate taxes hardly matter, give people money and they will spend, tax income), give away lands for FREE or very cheap to businesses willing to settle (happened a lot in the Netherlands in the 80's and 90's for example).

Of course the government only goes so far. The Greek workers need to understand that they are not all little saints with rights that others would dream off. Yes, you are important, yes you need to do your part. Take your loss, help start building your country. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh yes, I'll tell the guys on the work floor that we are laying them off in an already hard industry. Luckily they get a few months of unemployment benefits (60% pay) and then welfare because the EU and Putin have a squabble, I'm sure they'll understand when they are unable to become employed in their field as our economy is also on it's ass.

It's easy to talk when you are employed and largely unaffected.

	<TEXT> Loaning money doesn't work like that. And the Greeks need to understand.

"Forgive old loans and give us new loans." basically translates to 

"Forgive old loans and give us free money that you will never get back." 

A better compromise would be (which I still don't stand behind, but still)

"Forgive us part of our old loans and invest in our economy so we can move forward". 

A long time ago during my bachelor studies I was in a project group named "Trade not Aid"  where we helped European companies invest in Africa. No free money, no loans. Setting up businesses and letting the locals make money. It worked very, very well.

	<TEXT> In my opinion the referendum is just there to make the people think they have a say in this. They do not. Every single action so far has been in the direction of "We need more money, we promise to pay it back, also lend us more money so we can pay back the previous lender." It's like a pyramid scheme on national level.

What the Greek people and government need to do it turn very frugal, start to learn to live on the welfare level they can afford. Reform the economy (I mean, really, what does Greece have? Tourism and limited agriculture?). Exploit upcoming markets. They have tons of sun and wind, become the number one net exported of Green energy in the world. I'm sure that the EU would be willing to help pay for that. Create the best damn tourist place to be you can. Last time I was on holiday in Greece it was terrible, I would not return. etc etc.

Go frugal, live a life that you can actually afford, reform, create a unique selling point. It is hard, and I certainly do not know HOW they should do it, these are just my ideas, take them for what you will. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I used to be a very vocal "Grexit" proponent. But I feel more and more pity for the Greek people.

It's all a giant clusterfuck of failure. First politicians scammed the people and the EU into joining the Euro. Then everything goes to shit. Then they elect a government  that cannot possibly solve this issue. 

We (the EU) should have let Greece go years ago. It would have been cheaper for the EU, and less painful for the Greek people. The bitter pill would be there, but a whole lot less bitter than it is now.\

My guess: Grexit before the end of the year with very limited impact to Europe, and near third world levels of poverty in Greece. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Regardless of Siemens, this is pretty common for a lot of firms. One of our biggest customers is in Russia. 

Fortunately we have a joint venture in China. We ship the 99.9% ready product to them. They tack on some extra nameplates and upload the software (made in the EU) and ships to Russia.

And believe me, we are not the only ones. For us it is either this, or close one of our factories, firing approx. 500 employees, our margins are already razor thin as it is due to competition from lower cost countries.

The only ones that are screwed by this are smaller companies, farmers, and other agricultural companies. </TEXT>
