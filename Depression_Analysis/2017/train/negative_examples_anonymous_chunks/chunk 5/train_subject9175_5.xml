	<TEXT> The trouble both films have is [spoilers](#s "making it believable that the two leads could be forced into falling in love. In the original, they resort to "because hypnosis is magic" which works reasonably well and we suspend our disbelief. In the remake, I just don't buy that his plan could be so reliant on the pair sleeping together. There are so many "But what if" moments for it to really work. ") </TEXT>

*The DVD contains a FAKE alternate ending where Average Joe's loses the final match and the film goes to the credits as the announcer exclaims that they are going home with absolutely nothing. This was apparently sacked after test audiences were unhappy with the original ending (Globo Gym wins).* </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't buy it.

It makes no sense, isn't particular funny AND, if you watch the ending on the DVD, it is exactly the same as the final scene, it just slows down and fades to black with Stiller jumping around having won.

I always assumed it was a joke for the DVD extras. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My tap has been leaking from the base. I've pulled it aparted and discovered the o-ring is very loose. I'm not stretching the o-ring in the photo below. It hangs this loose.

Trouble is, I don't know the brand and no hardware store or supply shop can help me.

Any ideas? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Perhaps if you are a wild animal or a human long ago.

The beauty of human's evolution of the past few thousand years is we have grown to appreciate intelligence OVER base aggression. 

It is why people, as well as physical attraction, also look for wit and intelligence. The ability to rape is not really something either men or women look for much anymore.

Probably best to remove it from the 'special skills' of your OK cupid profile.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm not a gun person so please excuse my ignorance. In fact, I'm not even sure a taser *counts* as a gun.

What would happen if you pushed a Taser into a solid surface (the ground, a wall or even a person's chest) and pulled the trigger?

As I understand it, Taser cartridges have blast doors on them that swing open or blow off when the gun is fired, allowing the prongs to fly out.

If the Taser was pushed up against a solid surface, I can't see how those doors could open.

If a Taser was pushed hard into someone's chest, what would happen?

NOTE: This is different from the stun gun that REQUIRES you push the gun up against someone.
