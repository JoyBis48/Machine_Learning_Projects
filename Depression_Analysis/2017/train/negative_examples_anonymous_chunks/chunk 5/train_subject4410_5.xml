Also, he was the one begging for a review because he thought more time should have been taken off, not put on. So, it is  his fault that we had time for Lebron to command the ball.

	<TEXT> Bruh, Lebron shot 8 for 25. 7 TO's. that's not a season average. Kyrie cant jump or sprint with one foot. that's not something that happened in the regular season. dont try to act like theyre playing normal. if Lebron and Kyrie play like the duo theyve been all year, this isnt a game. 
And I'm perfectly content being down 1-2 because we have the best player on that planet on our squad. Also, cleveland doesnt have a home court advantage. their home crowd was basically terrible so those first two were neutral site games as far as im
concerned. 
In the end, being down 1 to 2 without a 17 and 10 guy, without a play making shooter for the first two, and with a plethora of injuries isn't the worst it can be. I have faith in King James.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> are you? sounds like a pretty biased take on officiating from your end too, boss. they called a foul to make up for the missed goaltend, by the way. watch it back, literally nobody touched him. but, all that aside, yall won the game. congrats. yall got 50 from your top two, we got 38. we got out rebounded badly. had basically zero fast break points. got out scored by 15 on 2nd chance points. and we still only lost on a hail mary. im content with that. the question is, are you? just hope it doesnt scare you that Lebron and Kyrie have played like complete shit for 3 games and it's still a close series. we'll see what happens when they get it going </TEXT>
