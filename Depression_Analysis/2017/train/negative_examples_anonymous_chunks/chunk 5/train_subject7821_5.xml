	<TEXT> When I got the XB1 at launch, I had some problems. Was speaking with a customer support specialist   they gave me some advice:

When installing a game from disc, disconnect from the network. If connected to network, the console will recognize the disc but install from their servers for newest version (if available). 

If install from disc  way faster

(never tried it, I'm rocking disc-less)

	<TEXT> There's a conversation I've had at least 8 times in my life. I meet someone   we talk about books. They say, "I love Stephen King", "He's my favorite writer",   sometimes "I've read everything he's written"

Then I reply, "How did you like the Dark Tower series?"

They say, "Oh, I haven't read that"

It's easily his best work. Book 1 was written early in his career (  re-written). It's Ok. Book 2 is better. Book 3 starts a great series. The fact it relates to other Stephen King books is only icing on the cake... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In 1999, a year before the 2000 election, I began tinkering with the idea of a site that would match a person with their best suggested politician. 

The idea was to let a person take a political litmus test   get matched with a politician. It wouldn't be a social network (the user would have the same privacy you have in a voting booth). The test(s) would be as in depth as the user was willing to go. Daily quizzes / questionnaires / polls. The site would also link users to potential blogs, articles, resources, charities, or anything relative to the users interests. 

I worked on this project for several years. I met with programmers, political science instructors, politicians, message boards, etc. The plan was to work on a major election (presidential)   work our way down to local level politics.

Then a couple years ago a programmer I had tried to enlist sent me this link. I knew instantly that someone had beaten me to the punch. 

I recommend this site for anyone trying to make an informed decision. It's an excellent tool. I urge you not to vote with your gut. Don't blindly support one party. Don't vote based on income, class, etc. Don't make a decision as important a vote without some research. Hopefully this will help.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> well put. I 100% agree with you: getting tired of replaying this game, having to  'work' to get stuff (I say work, because it's taking up a lot of my time), which is common of MMOs...

But: compare Destiny to Halo (what we primarily know Bungie for):

The Destiny story has more play ability than any Halo campaign. I usually play a Halo campaign once on Legendary co-op, another solo Legendary,   usually various sittings to get achievements. We can up the difficulty to Destiny's missions (not different, but harder) but we could also add skulls to Halo missions. 

Since launch, I've played Destiny's story more than any Halo campaign (  I'm a pretty huge Halo fan)   it's only been a couple of weeks. But, I'm tiring of it. I'm eager to anything new: DLC, missions, etc... After one week of playing, I had completed the story   then the level 20 'work' started. 

So far, we got 4 (large) Forge worlds (with AI spawns)   a tower map. 

Next, Multiplayer: Halo's MP has always been the true replay value. Destiny's MP is OK. Vehicles are terrible. Destiny's MP is fun, but the only purpose is to get Crucible points   perhaps upgrades. (When MCC comes, I can't imagine Destiny will be in my sights)

So far, I would say I've already gotten my $60 out of Destiny, but I too thought there would be more content. 

Good luck with the fanboys. They are the ones that think they speak for Bungie (speak for yourselves you sheep!).

I, too, worry about the Activision connection. Surly (not Shirley) Bungie took the preventable measures. Activision has a rep of nickel   diming us to death   taking IPs away from publishers.

	<TEXT> Destiny is vague. I understand it adds to mystery, but it's so minimally cryptic it's kinda aggravating. I'll play the hell out of it, I'm appreciative, but I've spent a week playing a game I don't understand at all. 

Halo has always had a ton of story stuff in the background. There's been origins. There's been viral ads that add to the lore. Bungie has out Bungie'd themselves.   I thought I was lost to Titanfall's story...  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> nobody ever feigned outrage over Bush W. it was genuine. there wasn't speculation, it was grounded in facts. nobody imagined that he was born in a far away land (although he actually wasn't from Texas). fear-mongering is all about 'what ifs'. the GOP is all about imagining what they are up against. 

the democrats are for policy where as GOP is for philosophy
http://www.vox.com/2014/9/15/6131919/democrats-and-republicans-really-are-different

one party is attracted to tangible results   the other is attracted to something in their gut. what is it with the GOP   them not believing in science, facts, or anything laid out in front of them in favor of made up hypothesis or religion? 

they're not focused on helping the people the people who elected them so much as they are on getting their way (  staying in power). they'd rather monkeywrench DC for 2 Obama terms than do a job. come 2016, they're hoping voters blame Obama for their lack of attention. they'll do anything to win an election EXCEPT have a proven track record   run an honest campaign...all at the expense of the public.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I used to live down the street from the Jehovah Witness 'church'. Every Saturday morning, a group of little ole ladies would walk out to convert but would always go straight to my house. (never a different neighborhood...)

Usually, I would have bartended till very late Friday night   would come home after the bar closed   would pass out playing video games somewhere around dawn on the couch. Around 8am, they'd knock, I'd have to put on pants   hear their spill about their faith. I'd smile, take their pamphlet (while my Jack Russell would be begging to eat them up at my feet),   go immediately back to sleep....

BUT: after 10 times, I decided to skip the pants   straight up answer the door in my boxers... it was half way through their speech when I noticed my morning wood had made it out the tent   was distracting them. 

They never came back.
