	<TEXT> But you claim that multiple papers presented at Ringberg "suggest that 2C will be the high" by 2100, which they did not. To the best of my knowledge, *no consensus* at Ringberg or in credible climate science has said any such thing. If anything, the studies presented at the Ringberg Workshop project a likely warming of around 2.5C by 2100, which is both well beyond a "2C upper limit" and probably very conservative given [new data](http://news.sciencemag.org/climate/2015/02/cold-pacific-ocean-offsetting-global-warming) on oceanic warming. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> "Backing off the IPCC's 4.5C prediction?" First, 4.5C is the *high end* of the IPCC's current 1.5 - 4.5 degree temperature forecast for 2100. It's not the median. However, more [recent studies](http://phys.org/news/2015-02-evidence-ipcc-climate-sensitivity.html) suggest warming will be at the upper end of this range in a business-as-usual scenario. 

Second, China and India are poor, developing countries heavily invested in hundreds of new coal-fired power plants, their per-capita emissions are still far below ours, and they rightly point out that we westerners are responsible for nearly all of the carbon pollution cooking the climate to date. Still, both ([and especially China](http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2015/02/04/3619026/china-gets-ready-for-national-carbon-market/)) are now making strides to reduce their pollution. </TEXT>

2C is one *hell* of a long way beyond natural variance in global climate within a single century, and most experts agree that we have already effectively locked in that amount of increase given that we are unlikely to completely quit burning fossil fuels in around 25 years, which is what it would take to limit warming to 2C.  We are more likely headed for [3-4C](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/dec/31/planet-will-warm-4c-2100-climate) warming by 2100.

Fascism rose as a reaction against socialism, led by nationalists like Hitler who hated the internationalism and pacifism of socialists, who many Germans blamed for  losing the First World War. Most fascist governments since have been similarly violent, nationalistic, anti-communist, and run by charismatic strong men.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> we would see massive investments in solar by private industries to save money and become more efficient. They aren't doing that without subsidies.

[In many regions of many countries solar is now grid-competitive without subsidies](http://www.fastcoexist.com/3043473/in-much-of-the-world-solar-power-is-already-as-cheap-as-grid-electricity).The United States now has a [a few of those regions as well](http://www.hawaiireporter.com/big-rooftop-solar-panels-make-sense-in-hawaii-without-any-subsidies). Many more are on the way.

That's looking at world wide oil and gas and doesn't take into account the enormous difference in market size between oil and renewable. On a per capita basis renewable receive far more money in subsidies than oil and gas

Fossil fuels are the world's second-most-subsidized industry, after arms, and they are *vastly* more subsidized than renewables.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> "Solar isn't financially viable - except with massive government subsidies and grants.

First, solar is very economically viable without subsidies in some places right now, and its cost is dropping by half every five years, so it will soon be economically viable nearly everywhere.

Second, solar subsidies are dwarfed by the [$550 billion in annual direct subsidies to the oil, gas and coal industries](http://image.slidesharecdn.com/d2-am-s7-subsidies-petarvujanovic-ocde-141205102749-conversion-gate02/95/fossilfuel-subsidy-reforem-by-petar-vujanovic-2-638.jpg?cb=1417796944)--and that's without considering the trillions in annual *indirect* subsidies for fossil fuels, for things like military actions and automotive infrastructure. And these are subsidies for a mature, incredibly wealthy industry that needs no help with new infrastructure or development, and, let's not forget, this is an industry that every national scientific academy has identified as a major threat to global wellbeing, while solar presents one of our best opportunities to reduce that threat. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Young people forty years ago didn't vote any more than they do now. Boomers didn't really begin voting in large numbers until the 1990s, and they've only recently begun to hit the late-life stage when people tend to vote without fail (which usually begins around age 65).

As for your feeling that the baby boom was defined by Woodstock and so on, with all due respect that view was manufactured for you by pundits looking for something to talk about at the time and afterwards. Don't get me wrong: the early boomers' coming of age in the late 1960s was big, but mostly because the generation followed the 1930-1945 baby *bust*. However, in economic terms relevant to this article, the boomers had their biggest impact much later than most think.

Truth is, the larger, younger end of the baby boom has much more in common with GenX: they all hit adulthood after the early boomers had taken many of the jobs and bid up the price of houses; all were part of the cohort that first lost employer pensions and lifetime job security.

On the contrary. The smart grid is coming for a hundred reasons that have nothing to do with intermittency. Smart meters and smart buildings top the list, and those primarily concern cost control and efficiency, as outlined in [this ComEd overview](https://www.comed.com/technology/smart-meter-smart-grid/Pages/smart-grid.aspx) which lists everything *but* intermittency. 

The poorest countries don't have nukes

Pakistan *is* one of the poorest countries, and nuclear-armed. North Korea as well. Russia isn't exactly rich. Others will follow.

	<TEXT> I am aware of no single study that doesn't acknowledge the costs of integrating intermittency into the grid. If there were one, I bet you would have cited it.

http://cleantechnica.com/2014/01/24/forget-intermittency-nrel-says-wind-energy-can-boost-grid-reliability/

A smart grid exists for the sole purpose of dealing with intermittency.

No, the smart grid is needed for many reasons: resilience, smart metering, peak pricing, operational savings, etc.. 

I know it's popular to dream of a day when every home is it's energy castle, but it just isn't backed up by economic realities.

Who said grid power will vanish? Not me.

The purpose of warfare when caused by economic depression is to seize what others have. How can you do that if you nuke their shit?

Clausewitz disagrees with your definition of war's purpose, but history shows us that *any* rational "purpose" for war is usually quickly lost in gore, hatred, and the burned bodies of innocents piled to the skies.

To date the primary purpose of nuclear weapons has been defensive: "invade my country and we'll nuke you". However, conflicts and associated chaos will continue to escalate in the world's poorest, most climate-vulnerable regions as climate damage rises, both increasing temptations to incinerate enemies while also inevitably putting nuclear arsenals in the hands of victorious insurgents. ISIS, for example, sprang from the chaos of the long Syrian drought, gathered momentum by adding the excluded Sunnis of Iraq and now Yemen. They would dearly love to someday seize Pakistan and its nuclear missiles, and studies suggest that global warming is [adding to that very threat](http://www.dawn.com/news/1157200). And that's merely one of [many climate concerns](http://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesconca/2014/11/14/does-our-military-know-something-we-dont-about-global-warming/) that now worry US military leaders.

Let's just say that more desperation, drought, cultural friction and economic despair don't make a nuclear-armed world any safer.

	<TEXT>  The more renewables grow, the costlier their impact to the grid.

Debatable, and most of these complaints are coming from old-line utilities trying to preserve their sweet monopolies.

With or without renewables, we'll need a smarter grid, so it's unfair to blame all of its costs on the rise of renewables. 

 Batteries are far too expensive for developing countries. 

[Not for long.](http://dqbasmyouzti2.cloudfront.net/assets/content/cache/made/content/images/articles/Storage_Cost_Drops_530_402_s.png)

But what about the other two graphs that show more contemporary forecasts from multiple sources? In those, the Greenpeace forecasts still outperform by wide margins.

Again, the point isn't that Greenpeace is perfect, but that most researchers, even theirs, have underestimated the growth of renewables. As in this excerpt:

*"The results for solar PV are even more dramatic...In this case, though, actual statistics proved higher, nearly doubling the optimistic Greenpeace formulation."* </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There's no doubt that renewables are critical, and, taken together, they may be the single most important future power source, but they simply will not be enough, which is why several of the world's leading climate scientists recently issued [this joint letter](http://www.cnn.com/2013/11/03/world/nuclear-energy-climate-change-scientists-letter/) to world leaders.

The need to leave carbon fuels has now become an emergency. We need all hands on deck, and all the carbon-free power that we can muster...like, yesterday. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> More common: skilled, experienced older workers thrown out of work are reluctant to take a big step backwards, and often for good reason. If your income plunges in your 50s, you may well lose your spouse, your house, your health insurance. Your kids may lose their college opportunities. Prospects for any kind of retirement can vanish. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Simply put, this article is a steaming heap of lies spread for years by oil industry flunkies. No matter how often they're debunked, they just keep springing back like a case of herpes. 

There was no 1970s global scientific consensus that the climate is cooling. There was no UN forecast of "50 million climate refugees by 2010". And so on. 

Do some real scientific reading, or, if you can't, at least accept the facts that all 97 of the world's national scientific academies, and 97% of publishing climatologists, are in complete agreement that we are responsible for warming the globe. 

And also be aware that the largest industry in human history is doing everything in its power to confuse you about that. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ashton would be the wrong guy to ask about the economic details of decarbonization. He simply takes Shell to task for their refusal to acknowledge the need to do it at all, and good for him.

However, few in the know believe this will be accomplished with renewables alone. Nuclear will be part of the solution as well. Yet renewables will carry most of the weight, in both developed and developing nations. Solar/battery combos and microgrids, in particular, are well suited to developing countries precisely because they don't require existing transmission infrastructure. 

As for cost, two points: 1) The cost of decarbonizing is now low--about [1-3%](http://unsdsn.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/US-Deep-Decarbonization-Report.pdf) of global GDP--but will [quickly rise](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-05-11/power-decarbonization-cost-rises-22-to-44-trillion-iea-says) if we continue stalling; 2) the cost of *not* decarbonizing the economy is [potentially ruinous](http://press.princeton.edu/chapters/s10414.pdf) (figures like 20% of GDP are often mentioned), and that's before we consider that economic collapse on that order would almost certainly ignite nuclear war.

The only possible conclusion is that we have no choice but to leave most of the world's fossil fuel reserves unburned. The good news is that we can easily afford to do it. The bad news: we cannot afford to wait. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Cities are frequently on the hook for supplying utilities at low or no charge to new suburban developments beyond the city lines. 

It's a vicious cycle that pits city and county governments against one another like this: 

1) County government wants more tax base so approves new suburban development, free riding on burdens to city for water/sewer, connecting roads, etc..

2) City makes up for loss by annexing older commercial districts just beyond city lines, which costs county some of its tax base. So...

3) County government greenlights more development on suburban fringe to recoup tax base lost to city.

	<TEXT> About time. Until the 1980s, and with additional damage from a 1978 Supreme Court ruling, we had usury laws that made these practices illegal. And with good reason: usury makes the middle class poor, and it makes the poor debt slaves, tearing apart society. That's why the Bible ranks it as a capital crime in the same league with murder and rape.

[Here](https://americansforfairnessinlending.wordpress.com/the-history-of-usury/) is a reasonably good synopsis. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> First of all, your friend has poor taste in other friends, so you might look for better friends yourself. 

As for the link, it's all a pile of crap, but let's just address that first graph as an example:

 It cherry-picks a misleading time span, 1995-2010, which is one of the few in which *surface temps* (more on that below) were flat. To either side of this little window you'd see a rising temp trend.

 It ignores ocean temps. 93.4% of the excess heat from greenhouse warming goes into the oceans, and the oceans have continued warming unabated.

 We now know that the Pacific Decadal Oscillation and other long-cycle oceanic convection currents create multi-decadal cycles of heat capture and release to the atmosphere, so that warming will proceed in stair-step fashion. Right now we are in a PDO "cool phase" due to end in a few years, when atmospheric heating will again take off steeply as it did in the 1990s. 

 The HADCRUT dataset used here is not "air temperature anomaly" (The UK Met Office does not use that term) but "surface temperature anomaly". Because surface temps over the Pacific are not anomalously warm during a cool PDO phase, they make it seem as if global temps have gone flat. However, look what has happened over a [longer span](http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/hadobs/crutem4/), and, in particular, the steep warming in northern continental areas.

I could go on. Your "friend's friend" is putting his/her faith in an obscure conspiracy site created by a conservative lunatic, while ignoring the united opinion of every national scientific academy on Earth, after the largest scientific inquiry of all time? Again, avoid this asshole. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> give hospitals an incentive to compete on prices, and hopefully lower the cost of health care.

Unless you're shopping for a specific high-ticket procedure like a hip replacement, you'll probably find medical pricing too impossibly complex for comparisons. This just invites hospitals to engage in loss-leader pricing, gouging on everything else, and it encourages inefficiently duplicating costly facilities between hospitals because no hospital wants to miss a chance at rare but lucrative treatments.

The only thing that has demonstrably lowered care costs by wide margins is just the opposite: government control and near-universal risk pooling. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Marketing creative slots have vanished in recent decades due to automation in a dozen ways.

Consider the ad agency art director, so called because that person once directed dozens of artisans: pasteup artists, typographers, photographers, film makers, illustrators, strippers, engravers, printers, etc.. Now the "art director" handles all those roles alone, using Abobe CS on a Mac, usually using stock images rather than producing original art. Goodbye to most of those other creative jobs.

The rise of retail is another example, replacing the need for much advertising and PR. The key to *that* was the development of retail databases and scanners. Hello to more minimum-wage Walmart stockers; goodbye to highly paid ad agency copywriters and account execs.

Then consider the consolidation of major consumer companies, which used to be widely distributed but are now heavily concentrated thanks to IT systems that allow fast real-time management of complex networks. That means that the marketing work once done by dozens of local ad agencies and marketing departments across the country is now handled by a handful of people in New York and Chicago.

So, yes, marketing creativity is still in demand, but it takes a lot fewer people to provide it. </TEXT>

That's the way it should be. Every generation should improve on the previous.

	<TEXT> Sure, the world is well past its agrarian-era carrying capacity, so we are *all* technologically and economically interdependent now. However, over the next generation or so, the greatest threats to rich-world citizens are likely to be from chaos in poor, subtropical countries hit by drought and food supply interruptions. Syria and the Arab Spring uprisings are just a taste. ISIS is as much a product of climate change as of the American destruction of Iraq.

TL;DR- Spreading, climate-caused violence and economic strife abroad is probably a greater threat to Americans than is climate-related collapse of domestic systems. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Generally speaking, citizens of rich countries are at far lower risk than those of poor countries; citizens of temperate and near-polar countries are at lower risk than those nearer the equator; citizens of militarily strong countries are at lower risk than those of weak ones. As the world's richest, strongest country, largest food producer and owner of rich temperate and northern lands, the US will do much better than most. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A bit of both. The US still has a few further opportunities for large-scale hydro, and quite a number at small-scale, but damming many of those places (Yosemite, Canyonlands, Copper River, etc.) has been prevented by well justified environmental concerns. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> And state officeholders, county council members, school board members and so on. If there is one thing the old/white/passionate conservative base does well, it's to vote in *every* election, no matter how tiny. That ensures they always have a deep bench of junior pols ready to move up, and it preserves the heavy state and federal advantages given to rural voters which allow conservatives to punch well above their weight. </TEXT>
