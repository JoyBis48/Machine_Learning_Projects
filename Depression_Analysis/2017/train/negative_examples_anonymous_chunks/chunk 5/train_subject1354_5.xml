	<TEXT> As someone who deals in the used textbook industry... It makes me SICK what college bookstores buy back books for!!! There is a site called bigwords.com you can enter the isbn # of the books you want to sell and it will list all the sites that are buying back and at what price. Most have free shipping included. You can also find the books you need the same way. Some of the sites actually have local bookstores that you can print off the quote and walk in and get that price in cash. Where the store may have paid $15, the site will pay $80. I really hope this helps some of you... I can't stand to see the shit these bookstores try to pull. </TEXT>
