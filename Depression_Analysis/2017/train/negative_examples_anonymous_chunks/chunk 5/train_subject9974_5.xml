	<TEXT> The bull moose jolly roger waved proudly in the air as the crew ran to their stations. "Captain Teddy" as he was affectionately known to his men, began barking orders left and right for cannons to be loaded and weapons drawn. The first volley of cannonballs nearly ripped the entire side off the merchant ship (the SS San Juan). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A contract is by nature an agreed upon set of rules.

I never agreed to your society, and I never agreed to your social contract.

If you are assuming inaction = consent to your social contract, by that logic I can start a house cleaning business in which I wash all my neighbors houses, send them a bill, and then lock them in a cage when they refuse to pay. I will assume their inaction by not moving out of the neighborhood is consent to my contract. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Because some of us think the same rules that apply to individuals apply to the government.


If I offered to protect your house even though you never asked me to, and then threatened to throw you in a cage unless you paid me 10% of your earnings, would that be legal?


The government uses coercive force to extract taxes to pay for an involuntary contract which we see as inherently unjust. </TEXT>

2. There is a difference between having natural emotions and being a thinskinned crybaby. Life sucks. People say shitty things. Part of real manhood is learning to shrug off people's insults. I would say a man who is constantly whining, always getting his feelings hurt, etc is not a developed man. He is a baby.

	<TEXT> Christian belief system summarized; humans are all broken sinners who are mutineers against the Law of God. The punishment for such mutiny is death. Christ (who is God) died on the cross to pay the legal debt of that mutiny. He then rose again defeating the power of death and sin. By confessing our sins and believing in his sacrifice as sufficient alone for our salvation, and surrendering ourselves to Him as Lord and Sovereign, we can have our sins forgiven.


My beliefs are summarized briefly in [The Nicene Creed](http://www.reformed.org/documents/index.html) and more in depth in [The Westminster Confession of Faith](http://www.reformed.org/documents/wcf_with_proofs/)

The differences between denominations are very nuanced and hard to explain in summary. It really depends on which denominations you are asking about. Basically there are three broad divisions

1. Roman Catholic - believe in the authority of the Pope, and the various vatican counsels as authoritative.

2. Orthodox Christian - recognizes a different patriarch than the Pope. They have their own cultural heritage and body of teaching seperate from the RC church.

3. Protestant - products of the protestant reformation. There is extreme diversity within this broad heading. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My wife and I went into our relationship agreeing that she would be a housewife and I would be the breadwinner. We established the boundaries of our roles early on, so it has never been a problem. She works a littlw business on the side, and volunteers at the USO as a shift manager. 


I think the important thing is to establish your opinions on what role you each will take before your relationship gets serious and there will be no problem. I don't expect every couple to have the same dynamic my wife and I do, but if you are the kind of guy who cannot marry a career woman, don't. If you are the kind of guy who believes your wife needs to have a career, then don't marry someone who does not. </TEXT>

I get my hair cut every weekend. I think every man should have a great barber. I love my barber shop, its a man's retreat. I actually look forward to my weekly cut. My barber gives my high and tight, shaves the sides of my head with a straight razor, and gives me a hot towel massage. All for 11 bucks.

Day to day I use brylcreem to keep my hair parted and combed.

With regards to the ladies, I am married so I don't gove a second thought to what the ladies think. My wife loves my hair. She loves right after I get a cut and the sides of my head are smooth. She also digs the smell of brylcreem.

	<TEXT> Depends on the scenario. 

If there was a reasonable threat I would step in physically. I am fully able to handle any physical situation that presents itself.

If she was just uncomfortable, I would ask her if she wanted help. I would not want to make her more uncomfortable though. 

Basically, if she was getting verbally harassed it would bleep my radar to keep an eye on her (I have a wife and sisters after all). If things escalated I would physically step in, take charge, and diffuse the scenario with whatever force was needed. 

If she is drunk, she cannot consent. Women are equal in value, but usually not in physical strength, build, and demeanor as men. As a soldier, and a southerner I would feel obligated by my code of honor to watch out for any female (or male) in a possibly dangerous situation. This is the life of a sheepdog. </TEXT>

I rejected any government assistance on moral grounds. I will not take government assistance, because I believe using the coercion of the state to take one person's money and give it to the needy is not compassion but robbery. 

I am all for charity. I have in the past accepted charity from my church, and would have no moral issue. That money was given to the church freely. I would *never* accept govt. assistance though.

	<TEXT> Nope. 

Here is a [link](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laissez-faire) that explains laissez faire capitalism.

We believe there are free market solutions to your problems. Monopolies are nearly impossible to achieve without government help. Many monopolies pop up because the state excessively regulates the industry so that new guys can't get in (think about the Uber controversy).  Labor and consumer protections would come from the private sector. You would have consumer watchdog organizations offering analysis of products. You will also have stupid consumers who buy without doibg theor research, and they woukd have to live with the consequences of buying without research. </TEXT>

How exactly do you see your stream of libertarianism as different from AnCaps? I think I can agree with everything you said. I believe workers should be allowed (not forced) to unionize, I don't see much difference between coop's selling products in a free market and individuals selling products in a free market.
Under your system, would individuals not be allowed to own business unless they were cooperative? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sure,

Peter explains how Christ took our sin upon himself in 1 Pet. 2:24, and 3:18. This is the idea Him taking our unrighteousness and sin-wages, and giving us His right standing in return.

John echoes this idea in 1 John 1:5 (where he explains that there can be no darkness in God the light, thus explaining our separation from God) through 2:3. He explains exactly what Paul said, that Christ is the propitiation for our sins, and that those sins are forgiven through confession.

	<TEXT> The reason we apply the RPW (which you will fins explicitly in the last statement of WCF XXI vs 1, that we are forbidden from worshipping any way not prescribed by holy scripture") to worship is because we believe Sunday is the Lord's day, the Sabbath, and we are obligated to keep it in accordance with the explicit way He instituted, lest we dishonor the Sabbath. 

We don't apply the same principles to the business aspects of the church, because there is nothing holy, no obligations commanded in regards to budgets, interior designs, etc. 

Our church government is not centralized, but very decentralized. It is not independent though. The scriptural precedent for oversight above the local church is found in Acts 15, qhere the Jerusalem Council exercised oversight on the matter of Greekness vs Jewishness. 

We believe there is nothing holy or significant about a name. Our name is simply another necessary business aspect of church organization.  </TEXT>

The path to life is the confession of our sin, and surrender of ourselves to Christ's sovereignty, aknowledging belief in his death on the cross as a substitutionary sacrifice that bore the weight of our second death and his resurrection as a victory over both deaths.  </TEXT>

We believe humans have three basic rights, life, liberty, and property. Those rights cannot be infringed upon. You cannot take someone's life in aggression, cannot take their liberty, and cannot take their property. This is not regulating the market, this is protecting liberty. 

If I murder the CEO of a large company, would that have some effect on the market? Sure. Does that make murder a free market issue? No. Just because the market is free, does not mean our other rights are nonexistent. Each individual owns himself. You should be allowed to work and sell and buy without state intervention, but you are never allowed to commit acts of aggression. That is the fundamental premise of right libertarianism. The market is free, and you are free, you are simply not allowed to hurt people, own people, or take their stuff. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Slave labor is a violation of the nonaggression principle. It has nothing to do with being a labor issue, it is a basic liberty issue. A libertarian society would operate under the assumption that everything being legal except acts of aggression.

If a child comprehends a contract, and is willing to trade his services in exchange for wages, I am fine with that. We would have to have lawyers that ensure the child understands the contract fully. If he is in any way being coerced into working, it is an act of aggression and therefore illegal. Again, nothing to do with regulating the market. The child must be able to comprehend what the contract means, and left free to quit that association whenever he/she wants. Otherwise, I see no problem with letting them decide if they want to work.

BTW, you will note in my original comment I never said I was a full ancap. I lean ancap. I believe the existence of night watch state is necessary. I believe the state should only intervene to prevent/punish acts of aggression. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As a libertarian..

Not even remotely. I do in fact believe the government should have no role in infrastructure. I lean anarcho-capitalistic. I am an absolute laissez-faire capitalist. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have a to-read list. 

If I am headed to my bookshop I will make a shorter list, choosing the books I would like to read most and I give that list to my bookseller. She crosses off the items she does not have in stock, and I pick up the rest.

I usually ask my bookseller if she had recommendations since I last saw her. I take her recommendations into consideration. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I understand there is a lot of controversy about the possibility of this leftist party winning. 

Who exactly are they? I understand they are leftists, are they democratic socialists or more communistic?

What is their platform?

If they gained power how would Greece change? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have read others, the Q'uran and bits and pieces of Buddhavacana. 

It was not quantifiable. I do believe faith is a gift of God. All men are dead in soul until he brings them to life. So it is nothing a man can do on his own to instill faith within himself.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Rand Paul is the best option right now IMO.

He is not perfect, but he is certainly not a neocon. I think definitely a step in the right direction, though I wish his father had won more than anything. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> He is a religious neocon. 

He is a social conservative, outspoken against libertarianism.

Against legalization of cannibis, for affirmative action, vague on foreign policy (by his associates I assume typical neocon).

I am not a huge fan. I am hoping for Rand to run, he is the best option in my book.  </TEXT>
