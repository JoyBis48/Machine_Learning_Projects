	<TEXT> or sci-fi shows period, i dont care what its about, instead its like "oh you need a GOT fix and that movie you didnt see in the theater, but still want to see plays next month, well instead heres some more guilt exploiting documentaries about global warming, and homophobia, and AIDS themed miniseries, because we need more emmys and golden globes and youll nominate them because youll feel like a huge jackass if you dont!! because THATS how we do it!." i mean seriously i mean global warming and all that stuff is a serious issue but whoever owns HBO right now if youre reading this, please consider a sci-fi show (preferably space opera), thank you. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> see this is what i never understood, i have zero complaints about a movie, but its made hard to enjoy because people keep pointing out the flaws, like going out to get gourmet chocolate pudding with friends and enjoying it, and then you hear the people you were with at the time complain about it either looking like a doggie doodie, or not being flavored to their liking? it wears you down

	<TEXT> without being seen as a bully, i mean i like them and no one can take that away, people can complain about them not being made to their liking, or the classic "they dont follow genes vision" excuse but we have the franchise back and thats something that a sci fi fan can appreciate. also i think we should give bob orci a chance, i mean think about it, the new movies got rave reviews, and we have 2 new movies already i wanna know what dont people like about the new movies, and ill share why i like them, and i like them because they bring life into this franchise with these talented actors in beautiful action packed fight scenes. and thats why i like them, and now why cant i have that opinion i ask? explain why, itll give me clarity to this kerfuffel

TheSolarSailor if you're reading this I HATE YOU Motherfucker! People like you give movie buffs a bad name. There's gonna be Star Wars fans whether you like it or not!!!!
