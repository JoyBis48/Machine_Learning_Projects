	<TEXT> Just curious as to what equipment you've been using to mix or practice on that you don't know how to to set up your laptop.

Just a word of warning, set up a time before your gig so you can hook up all your equipment and make sure it works. A few days before the gig if possible, sinceb it sounds like you don't even have all the equipment you think you need. 

I'd also have a back up plan, like having a bunch of tracks prepped on a USB drive in case you can't hook up your laptop. I'd suggest setting them up in rekordbox if you're using CDJ's.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> People who work there are empowered to take care of the customer as they deem fit. It won't hurt the bottom line much if you realize just how many drinks get thrown out in a day.

Also, giving away a drink and then having that person, most likely, share their experience with friends or on social media is probably one of the cheapest (and most effective) type of marketing they can buy.

	<TEXT> You should talk about ideals and your philosophy on life. You should let them share there point of view with you. If you end up sharing your life with this person then it's critical that you both have simular ideals about life. 

Gender roles, the belief (or lack of belief) in a god, ethics, food, long term life goals (like what/where you want to end up so that you'll feel happy), and family goals (like when/if you want marriage and kids). These are some heavy subjects but eventually you'll  want to discuss them. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> American Bartenders - What do you deem is an appropriate amount to tip per drink? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-04-03 17:52:39 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Some ways I've seen people tip:

* $1 per drink, regardless of price or effort.

* $1 per drink for drinks that only require pouring (ex. beer, a shot, a glass of wine, etc.)

* $1 per drink, and will increase with difficulty/complexity of drink being made. (Usually an arbitrary amount decided by the patron).

* Percentage of total (usually 20%).

**Bartenders:** How much do you expect to be tipped? What is the amount of tip that can be left, where you will still feel stiffed, even though a tip was left? Do you ever feel that, due to slow service or messing up an order, you deserved a lower than normal tip?

**Bar patrons:** How much do you tip your bartender and what is your reasoning behind it? </TEXT>
