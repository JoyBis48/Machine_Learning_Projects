I'd love to see a pro driver take a Hellcat on Laguna Seca and then the GTR.  I bet there is more than 2 second lap times faster in the GTR.

EDIT [it's over 6 seconds a lap faster than the Hellcat at Willowsprings](http://fastestlaps.com/tracks/willow_springs_-_streets_of_willow.html) and it's only 2.5 seconds faster than a GTi that has almost 500hp less.

The Hellcat is a muscle car and a damn fine one, not a supercar. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Seattle is looking at SF as what things may come.  TONS of tech job openings that pay 60-100k/yr.  That's easily liveable money in Seattle.  People are coming in droves to work at Amazon, Google, HBO, ADT, Starbucks, Zillow, Redfin, Adobe, Expedia, M$, Nintendo, Pokemon, Nordstrom, and countless startups.  They are buying up/renting out all the apt's near downtown to minimize the shitty commutes forcing out all the artsy folks that are barely making money as is.

It's creating a pretty big divide between the people that have been there for decades and these new transplants.

Not sure how to stop it from following suit other than I'm happy I live where I live. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> at least they have plenty of room to build and cheap property to do it.

SF really has no where to grow but up.  Until then, it's going to be more and more expensive. 

If I wanted to buy the same house I have have now in SF (brand new construction, 4bd 3.25 bath, 2500 sqft) it would cost 2-4 times more than what I paid, and it would have been built in the 1920s.  Thats 4-8 times more than the house I had before with similar specs.

Both me and my wife would need to both be making 6 figures to live the way we do now. </TEXT>

I was one of the top three sales guys in Oregon around 2002.  I would make $650-$800/wk in commissions plus minimum wage (which basically took care of taxes).  In today's dollars that would be $65-$70k/yr slinging electronics. I'd be interested to hear how much people are making today. </TEXT>
