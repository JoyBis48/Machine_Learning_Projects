	<TEXT> No.. it is not.. 

MAT 90 is because the student didn't do well on the assessment test. College level math starts at 101. Students interested in teaching, and any degree really, are required to take math classes to a certain point to satisfy their general requirements. 

When they go to their program of study, in this case education, they will take other classes that focus on how to teach it among other things.

Here is an education major at a university in my city. This is the math requirements for a degree in their program:

MAT-150	Mathematics for Elementary Teachers I	This is the first in a two-course sequence designed for prospective elementary school teachers. Concepts include set theory, functions, numeration systems, number theory and properties of the natural numbers, integers, rational numbers, ratios, proportions, decimals, and percents, with an emphasis on problem solving and critical thinking. Prerequisites: Grade of C or better in MAT 134 or 3 years of high school algebra with a grade of C or better.	4
MAT-151	Mathematics for Elementary Teachers II	This is the second in a two-course sequence designed for prospective elementary school teachers. Concepts of elementary probability, data analysis, descriptive statistics, geometry of shapes in two and three dimensions, congruence and similarity, measurement, and geometric transformations, with an emphasis on problem solving and critical thinking. Prerequisite: MAT 150.	4
MAT-250	College Algebra and Trigonometry	This course is a unified study of fundamental concepts from algebra and trigonometry that provide the necessary background for the study of calculus. Topics include modeling linear equations and inequalities; functions and their graphs; polynomial, rational, exponential, logarithmic, and trigonometric functions; systems of equations and inequalities; matrices and determinants; and conic sections. There is an emphasis on developing both a fundamental understanding of these concepts as well as their application to real-world problem solving. Prerequisites: Grade of C or better in MAT 134 or 3 years of high school algebra with a grade of C or better. </TEXT>
