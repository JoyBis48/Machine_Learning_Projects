1/2 Cup of OrganicVille Marinara Sauce 

2 Slices of Organic Mozzarella Cheese 

4 Cloves of Organic Garlic 


Cook the chicken breast with sliced up garlic using pam or some zero calorie spray on a pan, add salt and pepper to your liking. I use a lot of pepper. Add tomato sauce at last minute. Take Chicken off pan and put it on a plate. Mix garlic with sauce and pour ontop of chicken, place slices of cheese on top. Add salt and pepper. Put plate into oven on Broil and remove when it is to your liking.

Also, not pictured I added two table spoons of Parmasan afterwards.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm sane. I say that not expecting you to believe that. No offense, but you're hurting me with that look. See, I'll tell you the truth but let me say everything that's on my mind before you pass any judgement. I mean, I know you'll pass judgement but reserve your final judgement until I tell you everything. 

I hear voices. In my head. Like real voices and they're really mean. AND THEY'RE NOT ME. I know my voice, my voice is the one talking to you. My voice is from my heart. These voices are like ghosts or demons that live in my head. 

I'm so scared. Sorry, I love you. Please, don't say anything. Just. Like. I'm afraid you're not gonna believe me. This is so painful for me. 

See, like, I hear the voices. But I ignore them. I know they're not me but they won't go away. I used to fight them and tell them to get out or to go die or to fuck themselves but then they would attack me. They know my every insecurity and they say stuff at times you wouldn't be able to understand how painful it gets. 

I just heard one laugh. Now they're whispering. I swear this is real. I hear them. I don't think they're me, if they told me to kill somebody I would never do it! I swear! Joann, please believe me. They're laughing even harder now. I just want this to stop. I just want to go back to normal. I hate it here. The voices aren't going away. Their treatment isn't working!  

I'm sorry. I'll stop crying. 

Thank you. Thank you. 

The doctors say i'm insane, but it's the voices that are insane.

	<TEXT> I don't care about fat, it's about calories. I read a 3 second spray is about 15 calories which is still a fraction of the amount of calories compared to olive oil. I looked it up after posting this so I guess the dish is closer to 470 calories.

still way less than olive oil.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not sure if it was in Breaking Bad, but I'm pretty sure Walt is talking to Jesse about how lies put up invisible barriers between people, and with Jane, Walt could never be truly honest with Jesse ever again... I think that was the beginning of Walt and Jesse's emotional alienation. I believe.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree with you mostly. She wants a higher quality product with Todd, yet standards won't be high enough, so somehow she's going to try to get Walt back in, and she won't be able to so she might need to persuade him some how, which could involve hurting those he loves. I would be really sad if Walt's family is hurt. Really sad. I really like Skyler now. I want the Whites to live.  </TEXT>
