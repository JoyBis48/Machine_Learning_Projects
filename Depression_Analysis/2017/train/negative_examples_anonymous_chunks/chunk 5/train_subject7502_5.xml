	<TEXT> The burning coughs of a young girl paralyzed with curiosity, aching to try something against her parent's wishes; the slow, dreamlike laughs emanating from the teen boy who finds humor and life in everything around him; the hushed, anxious steps and surreptitious puffs of a middle-aged man with children who must cloak his hobbies from a disapproving wife; an aging woman, kidnapped from the outside world by her pain, forced to live out her years in bedrest, who turns to the only medicine that truly relieves the pain. Four people, on opposite ends of the world, living completely isolated from the other. But, the world lies beneath a regal web of networks. These four people are not connected by the job web, the family web, the friend web, or the community web - they aren't even connected by the race or culture web. In some sort of joke played on us by the universe, they are connected by a leaf.  </TEXT>
