	<TEXT> We all know this has nothing to do with "safety."

Oral surgery has a greater complication rate than surgical abortion. Yet somehow these restrictions weren't placed on oral surgeons (or ANY other outpatient facilities that perform such minor surgeries.) Only women's health clinics were targeted. There's no requirement for double-wide swinging doors to accommodate hospital gurneys in oral surgery facilities, for example, nor will there ever be.

This is direct, blatant, selective, and persecutive legislation by the Texas government against women's medical facilities and obstetricians performing federally legal procedures.

How many cases of cervical/uterine/breast cancer will now go undetected because of these regressive laws? How many women will die from ectopic pregnancies because they didn't have access to basic women's health care? How quickly will cases of sexually transmitted diseases expand and multiply because no testing or treatment was available? How many women will lose their only access to affordable birth control?

This entire "But... but... *it's for the womens' safety!*" charade has never been anything but a damnable lie. But you already knew that.

You'd never have known the difference.

Call me crazy for being pro life.

And you'd probably think crazy those who view "life" as more of a non-commutable sentence of unceasing suffering ending in inevitable death than as a "gift" or a "blessing."

	<TEXT> It's simple: the forced-birthers clearly don't give a damn about either mother or child after launch. Can anyone realistically argue otherwise, given their constant, consistent contempt for any/all programs to assist these post-fetal Americans?

Nope. Almost instantaneously, the women and their newborns become "welfare queens" and "welfare brats" (who don't even deserve enough in SNAP assistance to keep them alive.)

The fetus fetishists certainly don't give a shit about "honoring a Culture of Life" after launch, do they? Hiding hatred of women behind a cloak of "morality" is the exquisitely cruel SOP of the American Right.  </TEXT>

Since by that time he certainly knew he was engaging in pedophilia with his sisters, I wonder if this "homosexuality leads to pedophilia" belief is an implied confession to Duggaring his brothers, too?

Imagine those poor Duggar girls lying there awake while they pretended to be asleep, waiting their "turn," powerless to stop their brother Josh from molesting their sisters right in front of the others, wondering what age he'd start on the next one, knowing that they were going to be the next one forced to lift their wrinkled nightshirt so Josh could poke and probe and prod and squeeze wherever he pleased with his sweaty, trembling fingers  

 and all the time knowing that ***it must all be hidden***, first, to protect the family, second because they were allowed no contact with those outside the sect, and third because no one would ever believe them anyway, instead calling them temptresses and liars and sluts and whores who had brought utter disgrace to the family and destroyed the family's means of support with their foul lies . . .  </TEXT>
