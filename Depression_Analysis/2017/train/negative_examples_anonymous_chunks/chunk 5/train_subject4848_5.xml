	<TEXT> I don't get the waste problem. The amount of solar and wind infrastructure you'd need to build to produce comparable energy would require a *lot* of mining, manufacturing, and transportation, while consuming water and land resources and producing CO2, all of which are far less manageable wastes than a much smaller amount of spent nuclear fuel. The nuclear waste management problem seems like it should be far simpler to solve. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Er, shouldn't it be much easier to set up a nuclear plant, which can produce huge amounts of energy from one plant for a large area regardless of geography, than huge land areas of solar and wind to produce the same amount of energy, which must take into account where's the best place to put them?

The long term cost in terms of climate change of waiting around for renewables to mature are going to be a lot worse than if we spent a little less in order to invest more in the one solution we know can compete with fossil fuels, today. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It seems to me that even compared to renewable energy, the environmental cost of nuclear energy is probably still less. The energy density of nuclear material is orders of magnitude higher than solar, wind, and fossil fuel, and it produces very little waste in comparison, and modern reactors are about as foolproof as possible. Converting to solar and wind require building a huge amount of infrastructure, that means mining, that means manufacturing, that means transportation, and batteries because solar and wind don't deliver base load power. Yes, it's far more environmentally friendly than fossil fuel, but that doesn't mean there aren't significant environmental costs in terms of CO2 emissions from manufacturing and transportation, environmental destruction from mining, toxic wastes from photovoltaics manufacture and mining, water consumption from manufacturing, land consumption from just having to take up a lot of land, consumption of nonrenewable elements from photovoltaic manufacture. And we're talking about technologies that have been maturing for decades and probably won't be fully realized for another few decades (we don't have that long in terms of run away climate change, if anyone's been paying attention to the Anarctic ice shelves). In comparison, nuclear has been mature for quite a while, it's the safest energy technology per unit energy produced (even, iirc, including casualties from horrible human precipitated disasters like Chernobyl), could have drastically reduced fossil fuel consumption decades ago and still could, and produces a tiny amount of relatively manageable waste, compared to all the environmental costs I listed above which apply even to renewables. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well the reality is that world growth rate peaked long ago, and as countries become more developed, they eventually start going negative in terms of population growth (ignoring immigration), so we should hit peak world population within the next century, or the next (the big uncertainty is what will happen to Africa). As far as food production goes, humans are actually pretty good at agricultural innovation: in the 20th century, food production grew 10x, while world population grew 6x. Most hunger in the world is not due to food shortage, but due to food inequality: systemic socio-politico-economic problems that prevent the poor from access to food even though there's plenty of food available (this is obvious in the US, but is also true in India, and really just everywhere, except war-torn and transient natural-disasters). So, many anthropologists, demographers, and developmental economists don't believe in the neo-malthusian predictions of the 60s onwards that population will decline due to massive mortality. The trend has been a decline due to low fertility, with low mortality. Development will naturally carry us over the hump of population growth towards a phase of population stabilization.

That said, I do agree we've been living on borrowed time, in terms of fossil fuels, eroded soils, wasted water resources, but I don't think it's a guarantee that we'll see massive mortality. Part of that is because it won't hit us all at once, so it really depends on if innovation and sociocultural attitudes catches up quickly enough. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That said, evolution *is* progressive, because it is a process that happens through time. The problem is that lay people confuse later in evolutionary time with subjective ideas such as "better". From the paleoanthropologist's viewpoint, we know what are characteristic of humans today, we want to know what evolutionary events happened which led progressively to modern humans--this can apply to any species of study. Part of the problem is that scientists often resort to teleological colloquialisms in describing evolution, because while incorrect, it is much less cumbersome to say.

 We know that brain size has little to do with inteligence. Sperm whales have brains 5 times as large us us, yet they aren't all that smart. And parrots (I think it's parrots, I know it's some type of bird) have us beat in brain to body ratio.

Brain size may not be comparable for distantly related individuals, but neanderthals are very closely related to modern humans, so brain size is one of the only ways of getting at the question of neanderthal cognition, even if it's not ideal. It's also not just size, it's size of specific lobes, which could indicate differences in certain cognitive faculties. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Which if you think about it is quite counterproductive. It's economically efficient for multiple generations to live in the same household, particularly when it comes to supporting the elderly. Yet our independent attitudes have pushed families towards basically "sub-nuclear" families, for a lack of a better word. The single-person and couple-with-no-kids households are the most rapidly growing types of households. Which is great from an individual level (people shouldn't be pressured to have kids, especially women), but terrible at the societal level in terms of, because given that they have no support from working children, how are we as a society supposed to fulfill our promise of social security which they payed into by working for many decades, when the relative proportion of young working people supporting social security programs is declining? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I kinda disagree to the extent that I believe all nations will eventually drop below replacement fertility. Even the most fertile nations in Asia and Africa have already been declining for some time or have just begun declining (though fertility statistics are problematic due to high HIV mortality in some regions). For developing nations, fertility decline is really a matter of how fast women's education, reproductive rights, and contraceptive use spreads in a region, which is correlated but not entirely the product of economic development. "having more and more children to send to work to make ends meet" doesn't make any sense, if there are less migrant worker jobs, people won't have more children. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In developed nations, *population decline and aging*. Most developed countries are already near or at replacement level fertility (2.1 children per women), and European countries like Italy plus Japan are far below replacement level fertility. Developed countries like the U.S. are not shrinking pretty much only because of a high immigration rate. Combined with longer lifespans, this means we're gonna have very few working young people supporting a large population of old people, meaning, current social security programs will fail, and economies will suffer. This will become increasingly the case as underdeveloped nations catch up and eventually hit below replacement fertility (and for them, it will be exacerbated by their much more explosive population growth period, the 30-40 years of extremely high population growth in the recent past will hit them like a tidal wave worse than the stresses of baby boomer retirement on US social security). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's not like teachers in high school are tenured professors. They're chained by state curriculums and pressure from administrators and the need to keep their job. While you are right *in theory*, in practice the intent of the bill is obvious. No teacher is going to suddenly start "help students understand, analyze, critique, and review the scientific strengths and scientific weaknesses" of germ theory, atomic theory, cosmology, etc. (literally, most if not all of science is theory building). If you add things, you have to remove stuff, because there is only so much time in a year. So it's pretty clear that teachers can't tackle "all existing scientific theories covered", the only ones that they'll tackle, and which state standards will push, are the ones that offend the sensibilities of lawmakers, administrators, parents, or the teachers themselves. None of the curriculum changes at the state, district, or classroom level are gonna be peer-reviewed, so there's no quality control on what is taught as science or not. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  some of best benders and nonbenders 

I actually disagree. When the White Lotus Army first enters Ba Sing Se, shown are quite a lot more people in the army than just Iroh, Bumi, etc. They have no screentime, instead, we focus on the characters that we know best and who are yes among the best benders in ATLA. We aren't given any indication of how strong they are. And as a secret philosophical society, it's likely that a lot of the members aren't fighters. The ones who would go to Ba Sing Se would be among the strongest benders in the society. 

It also makes some sense that the white lotus members doing daily sentry and guarding work, will not be particularly strong. The best benders in both series have always played big active roles as leaders in the world. I would probably consider Zuko, Tenzin, Chief Sokka as members of the White Lotus during LoK, even if it's not explicit. At the very least, Zuko and Tenzin are shown as superiors to white lotus members. So that bumps up their average somewhat. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> On the mixed race thing, that applies to pretty much any minority population. It's true of mixed Asian-Europeans in Western countries. It's also true in Japan; mixed Black-Japanese, or White-Japanese people are not considered Japanese by fellow Japanese people, even if they are in all other respects Japanese natives, they'll still be treated as foreigners. It's a property of seeming to be not of the majority population, regardless of what the majority actually is. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I work in population genetics. Of course you can tell (based on sequence comparisons, of various sorts) what genomic fragments are related to what genomic fragments. Hell, you let me sequence your genome, and I can partition your genome into various ancestral populations of origin, whether that be N. Indian, European, Denisovan, etc. There are companies whose business models is doing this directly to consumer (23andMe and Ancestry.com) with the ultimate goal of improving medical treatment. It's not a matter of belief or theorizing. We're talking about decades of development in population genetics, statistical inference, bayesian inference, and more recently machine learning. And countless hours of algorithm development and computational time at universities, government labs, and industries across the globe. How bout we at least *try* to accurately describe the amount of work that has gone into this. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Science has already provided the answer: turn it into starch and alcohol.

http://www.pnas.org/content/110/18/7182.abstract

 The global demand for food could double in another 40 y owing to growth in the population and food consumption per capita. To meet the worlds future food and sustainability needs for biofuels and renewable materials, the production of starch-rich cereals and cellulose-rich bioenergy plants must grow substantially while minimizing agricultures environmental footprint and conserving biodiversity. Here we demonstrate one-pot enzymatic conversion of pretreated biomass to starch through a nonnatural synthetic enzymatic pathway composed of endoglucanase, cellobiohydrolyase, cellobiose phosphorylase, and alpha-glucan phosphorylase originating from bacterial, fungal, and plant sources. A special polypeptide cap in potato alpha-glucan phosphorylase was essential to push a partially hydrolyzed intermediate of cellulose forward to the synthesis of amylose. Up to 30% of the anhydroglucose units in cellulose were converted to starch; the remaining cellulose was hydrolyzed to glucose suitable for ethanol production by yeast in the same bioreactor. Next-generation biorefineries based on simultaneous enzymatic biotransformation and microbial fermentation could address the food, biofuels, and environment trilemma.

	<TEXT> We'd still have molecular phylogeny, so we would eventually have a very good idea about how present day organisms are related to each other. We'd still have molecular clocks, though they would not be calibrated well. We'd still have ontogeny. We'd still have biogeography. We'd still have "living fossils" like lungfish to inform us of major transitions in evolution. Having molecular phylogeny is a huge asset, as it offers the *strongest* evidence we have for the common origins of life, but our picture of that tree, *especially* the morphology of prehistoric organisms, would be just a caricature. That said, we did roughly predict things like what Tiktalik would look like and where it would be before discovering it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I disagree with most of the posts in this thread. There are aspects of evolution that can happen quickly and predictably. I predict humans will evolve in the following ways in the next 100 years.

1) Increased admixture. With increasing globalization and relaxation of sociocultural attitudes, populations will continue to become less differentiated, and more people will be born of mixed population ancestry. Heterozygosity will increase, which ironically will decrease the prevalence of homozygotic traits. (We may see less red-heads).

2) Migration/Gene Flow. Pretty obvious. Related to admixture. Also influenced by globalization.

3) Host-disease evolutionary dynamics. Epidemics such as AIDS and Ebola have in the past few decades have selected for and will continue to select for disease resistance. Chances are there will be a few more such diseases this century, as long as there's still impoverished areas of the world without access to modern epidemiology.

4) Selective neutrality of previously deleterious diseases. As biomedicine improves, previously traits that were deleterious but persist in the population due to e.g. recessiveness, will become treatable and therefore neutral. The relaxation of selective pressure would allow such now treatable disorders to drift more freely in the population and increase. An example of this that is already happening is the observed increase in near-sightedness.

5) Genetic screening. Expansion of prenatal screening and women's reproductive rights will reduce the prevalence of very deleterious disorders. An example of this that is already happening is Down's syndrome, and there's no reason to not expect it won't happen with much more genetically influenced disorders such as Huntington's. This effectively removes these alleles from the gamete pool, and homozygous genotypes from the genotype pool.

6) Sexual selection, small selective coefficients, and genetic drift, will always exist to a limited extent.

7) Genetic engineering and gene therapy. There's a very real possibility that this will become a reality in the next century. CRISPR in humans may become a thing.

8) One demographic aspect of human evolution is that our population has grown tremendously in the past 200 years. As the rest of the world completes their demographic transition, the world population will eventually stabilize in population and actually start to decline somewhat (people in developed nations consistently reproduce at below replacement fertility). Exponential population growth has immediate effects on evolution, and this will shift as the world population enters a new regime of population stabilization and decline. One example effect of exponential population growth is that it introduces a lot of very rare variants quickly into the population, that is, many very rare familial diseases, which may soon go to extinction. It also means genetic diversity will increase as our effective population size catches up to census size (though this will happen over longer time scales than a century).

9) By demographic corollary, since African and to a lesser extent Asia will shoulder the brunt of the population growth in the next century (since most of the West has already stabilized in population), there will be a shift in gene frequencies at the global level. Africa in particular has always had the most genetic diversity of any human population, so we'll see a great expansion in the frequency of very diverged alleles that up until recently have only been found in isolated African populations.

10) Unexplored dynamics between an aging world population, longer reproductive spans, and selection.

tl;dr Evolution consists of the processes of selection, migration/gene flow, genetic drift, and mutation. It is also influenced by population structure and systems of mating. One or more of these will change in the next century, and thus human population genetics (evolution is defined as population gene frequency change) will change significantly, many of those ways being predictable. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As a math major who took a bunch of upper-level math courses working in a somewhat math related field, my opinion is that high schools should replace the standard two-course calculus track for the better students with at least one-course of statistics. Most people who take calculus will never need it unless they're going into a calculus-heavy subset of STEM. Almost EVERYONE can benefit from a strong statistical foundation IRL, and everyone in a STEM field including many others will use statistics. What surprises me more are how there are undergraduate majors in STEM that do not require a probstats class, or more than 1 semester's worth, because the only thing worse than no understanding of statistics is just enough statistics background to think you know it when you don't. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's taught wrong. Mathematics is so often taught as a bag of equations and a small set of standard questions repeated ad nauseum. When in reality, mathematics is about abstractions, concepts, symmetry, generalizations, and soundly reasoned arguments, which your understanding of can only be solidified through application to problems which stretch and test your abilities and build your intuition. You have to get in there and actually manipulate mathematical ideas to understand them. Mathematics is all deductive, yet curricula only over explore it superficially, lacking the necessary depth to build true understanding. </TEXT>
