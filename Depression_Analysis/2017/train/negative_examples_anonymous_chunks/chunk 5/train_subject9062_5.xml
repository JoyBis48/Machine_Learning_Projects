	<TEXT> I remember hearing this story from Stephen hawking.  

There was some scientist who were working on the world's first super computer.  When it was finished they asked it "is there a God?".  Right after the man asked his question there was
 a bolt of lightning that came down and fried the switch to turn it off.  Then the computer responded "there is now."

I don't know why but that story always stuck with me. </TEXT>
