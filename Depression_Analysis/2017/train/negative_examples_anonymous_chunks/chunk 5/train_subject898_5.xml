Oh jeezlaweez. I don't think Jesus ever intended a "church" to get this big. The name of Christ should be forefront, not the pastor. 

At the end of the day, Christ loves him all the same. No man is perfect, except through Christ Jesus.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Decent. Just working away at my job, of which I'm very blessed to have in this economy. Interestingly enough, the date I talked about didn't really pan out but led to meeting someone else who also loves Christ and seems to have a lot of interest in me. My only issue, and I believe it to be a superficial one includes that, though we get along fantastic, I don't feel very attracted to her physically and I don't know how important that is. There's also the fact of the matter of, why should I worry about a relationship at all? I am still currently back and forth with the sin of internet pornography which drives me crazy, so how could I be ready for a relationship? One good thing is, a friend of mine from work, has asked me to take him to Church recently, so we have been going. Prayer for him would be fantastic. His name is Charles. Other than that, I think I've come up with a tentative goal of moving to Hawaii in the next 5 years. Something about it seems to call me out there. But anyway, thank you for following up with me :D. I pray that you're doing well? </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Great buzzword. The embarrassing part is your use of the phrase "anti-Semite" is far too commonly misused and implies racism through its usage. Unfortunately for you, this video is not discriminatory towards any particular group or sect of people - neither is the title. It simply demonstrates a dialogue between the President of Israel (Netanyahu) and his acquaintances, as He discusses his intentions corresponding to Palestinian relations. Through his actions during his presidency, and most predominantly during the past month, it is the leader of the Jewish state, Israel, that demonstrates a lack of tolerance towards a specific ethnic group (Palestinians) - and thus can be dubbed "Racist".

	<TEXT> The definition of enlightenment can extend two directions. Your direction that you propose incorporates scientific progression and healthcare/augmentational advances. The other direction proposes that becoming enlightened involves understanding our inner-self, accepting that death is inevitable and living in peace through that knowledge. I do not foresee that the human race will be around for the many eons to come. There is also the consideration of whether or not the Creator will even allow this Universe to extend its existence longer than initially intended. Our existence is finite. But there is an infinite existence that we feel exists, and should strive to find, beyond our Earthly shell. This I feel is achievable through the understanding of Jesus Christ.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You just need the title to compliment the cover art. If not compliment, make sure it doesn't clash with the cover art, which I feel it is doing now. Especially the blue and red. Take a look at other cover art text, they usually match the aesthetic and have a style of their very own. At the very least, the text should be so minimalistic  and out of the way that people will find the album title once they've been pleased by the cover art. This cover has much potential and can't afford to be brought down by poor text.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, just gotta text him. As a guy, if I texted a girl about hanging out and she denied me (no matter the circumstance), I would be afraid to ask again too soon in fear of coming off clingy. So, to demonstrate mutual affection, you should make the move. No worries :D  And be completely honest with him about things. Relationships shouldn't ever be about tiptoeing on glass. Speak your mind, sweets. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [23/M] Relationship Noob here. In the very beginnings. Need advice on patience. </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So my hard drive on my computer died and I went to an old friend to help fix it. I got to meet his girl friend there and she thought I was so nice that I should meet her friend. I didn't think much of it because usually in those situations, I'm not attracted to the person they try to hook me up with. But this time was different and the girl is very pretty. We finally organized a double date activity together and I was nervous leading up to it because I didn't hear much back from my buddy and I felt almost out of the loop. But he's a dude, and doesn't really care too much about these things, I've come to learn lol. The interesting thing was that his girl friend actually took my number from his phone and contacted me to confirm our plans and stated how excited her and her friend were for dinner etc. I mentioned hiking and ice cream and the girl friend said that "might be better for the second date ;)". That boosted my confidence, as it seemed to demonstrate to me a reciprocated sense of anxiety and excitement prior to getting together, as well as preconceived future plans as a possibility. (I over think things, I know) We did dinner, and I met her. She was very pretty and very quiet, but very kind. I didn't mind the quiet, because I figured we would get to know each other in a more personal situation soon enough anyway. I got her number and she seemed interested in getting together soon. The only issue is that we work different schedules. But we both work at the hospital. I work third shift, she usually works second. And where she works there is no reception for texts etc. My real question, which is probably just me being a nervous nelly, arises from that fact that I texted her the next day about getting together soon and it took her over 24 hours to respond. The eventual response was appropriate and demonstrated interest, but I suppose I just need patience I guess. I'm just so used to people responding immediately, or at least within the same day. I just find it odd that her responses take so long to send and are so generically objective. It's almost like she's never texted before (at least for a girl, as most girls are very expressive and long winded in text form). Her length of time of response and responses are like interacting with a grand parent who just got text and only give you the exact answer you need for the moment. But, as of now, there's mention of getting together in a week when her schedules freed up to get a drink. Which is promising, but I just want to get things going asap. I know that's not a good quality to have, being anxious and wanting it all now (of which I don't show in public) but you'd think if someone was mutually interested in the other party, they too would want to interact as much as possible in the early stages. I suppose all I can do is chill the 'ef out and be patient. I'm just nervous because I desire a relationship to a large extent and want it immediately. But I can't force anything I suppose. The anticipation is just killing me. Any thoughts? Thanks :) Hope I don't come off as a winy biatch.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Job 2:2 And the LORD said unto Satan, From whence comest thou? And Satan answered the LORD, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.

And he led Him up and showed Him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time. 
6 And the devil said to Him, "I will give You all this domain and it glory; for it has been handed over to me, and I give it to whomever I wish. 
7 "Therefore if You worship[4][Or bow down before ] before me, it shall all be Yours." 
8 Jesus answered him, "It is written, 'YOU SHALL WORSHIP THE LORD YOUR GOD AND SERVE HIM ONLY.'

Luke 10:18 And He [Jesus] said to them, "I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven.

Jude 1:9 But even the archangel Michael, when he was disputing with the devil about the body of Moses, did not dare to bring a slanderous accusation against him, but said, "The Lord rebuke you!"

There's many other passages that have the character of Satan or Lucifer or The Serpant/ Dragon as being more than just allegorical. The Bible directly describes the Sins that arise against on this earth stem from our internal desires and evil, the worlds temptations and Satan's schemes. These entities are all seperate from one another.
