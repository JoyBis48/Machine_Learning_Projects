	<TEXT> No, I am not him. I was asked a couple of times before though. I have identified with this nickname since primary school. Copypaste of my username's origin :

It has nothing to do with fun. It has to do with panting. "Funt" means to pant in Czech and when I was little and used to go to school with my sister I would pant because she was bigger and older than me and I had problems to catch up with her. Idk exactly when it happened, but she called me "funk" a couple of times, I think, and I made a nickname out of it later. It is not easily translatable, but I think "the little one who pants" could be fitting.

Btw it's uncanny, though, we both live in Europe and I am just a few months older than he is. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What about heat? That kill Kerbals.

[My design is somewhat simpler](http://i.imgur.com/05wzTZL.jpg) (sorry for it not being transparent, there are two cubic struts on top of each other with 2 batteries and 2 seats on sides and 1 parachute on the top inside).  I tested it and it works, the fairings proved to be necessary since the heat/hot air killed the kerbal even behind the heat shield. The spin stabilization works, no need for a reaction wheel. </TEXT>
