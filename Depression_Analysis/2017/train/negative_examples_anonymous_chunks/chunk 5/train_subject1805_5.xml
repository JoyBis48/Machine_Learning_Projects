	<TEXT> Yeh completely understand and I can't be arsed with it all either, would love to just skip to the start of the season. I'm confident we will have a good summer though, everyone is on holiday, give it another week/two and reckon we will see it all start clicking into place  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Just quite confident that we will get him, can't really explain why I am but I think because a lot of players are on holiday that's why nothing is happening and being said that seems like it's on the cusp </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've posted before about meeting The King on here and I'll just say it all again he was amazing, kept me talking about football, got pictures with him and just an all round great bloke and a pleasure to talk too and spend some time with. 

My grandad always goes on about him, Best, Charlton, Byrne etc but when he talks about the holy trinity he gets a glint in his eyes and you can still see the wonder. He says he's the greatest striker he's ever seen play football not just for United and my grandad has watched a lot over the years. He had it all according to him and could do everything you wanted in a striker, he is The King </TEXT>
