	<TEXT> I got into them really early when they were just starting to hit the scene. Loved everything and then responsibility and my 30's hit and  for some reason keeping up on albums etc went by the wayside.

I spent a good 5-6 years just throwing on the old stuff I knew or just talk radio when it came to silence.

Listening to El Pintor for my first time all the way through. (I know, i'm late) but damn its almost a better feel knowing its a trio. That video for Everything is Wrong. Holy shit is that not the coolest video. 10/10 on that video.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I introduced it to my girlfriend last month and of course she fell in love so we got in a couple episodes a night and then a good 5 or 6 on Sundays. 

Heres the thing...we decided to split up in about the 4th season so we watched one of if not the most deep, relationship heavy shows of all time...while breaking up. We have been together for 6 years. It is fairly amicable but very tough, of course. 

We live together and I am going to be the the one moving out. She has kids (from a previous marriage) which I have grown to love and consider family. This is all very difficult but a new beginning. 

The last 4 episodes starting with Nates death was just a bawling fest but the finale, which I knew was going to be one of if not the most amazing finales was going to crush us. 

Well, it did. We spent the hour or so after the ending just sobbing...talking...apologizing for everything. We are still splitting up but it was very therapeutic to have this all coincide. 

Thank you for reading.

	<TITLE> Transmission advice on an 03 Ford Ranger please. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-02-05 21:45:16 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I've got an 03 Ford Ranger which has been diagnosed by two shops as needing a new transmission. It's drives but I have no reverse or O/D. It shifts into reverse and when I press on the gas it budget a bit. What I am currently doing is turning off the O/D switch on the column and manually shifting 1st into second and then second into D which it then in turn shifts itself from 3rd to 4th. 

A friend of mine has an 02 Explorer which has a blown engine but a working transmission. Both of these vehicles are 4.0 4X4 and Automatic. I'm wondering if I could switch it out? The VIN#'s for both are:

Ranger 1FTZR45E63TA39056

Explorer 1FMDU73K52ZC97255

Also, if not is there any way I could buy one online on the cheap and do it myself (I'm fairly handy). I've got a general knowledge of how these work and a 250 piece craftsman socket set but would rather pay someone if it's impossible for me to do this on my own.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> In the late 90's I owned a [Boss BR-8](http://www.bossus.com/gear/productdetails.php?ProductId=437) and I recently came upon a dozen or so of my zip discs.

I have an [iomega zip 100](http://www.ebay.com/itm/Iomega-Zip-100-Drive-USB-100MB-pc-mac-compatible-usb-powered-nice-/201267810149) which is allowing me to download the files. They are in vs3 and vr8 formats. 

Does anyone know where to go from here? Has anyone had any luck? In a perfect world I would love it if there was a Boss app that would just accept these files and let me connect it via fire cable on my ipad.

Yah, right.

I own a windows 7 laptop and an ipad 4gen.

Any ideas?

Thanks for reading. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think they held on to some big guns in the writing department for this series finale via 4 episodes. There was a time where I was falling "out of love" with the show but these past 2 episodes have really brought me back and now I'm super sad its really going to end.

 I am preparing myself by starting to watch Six Feet Under all the way through (again)
