	<TEXT> I saw The Cure there. A girl in the row behind me was smoking a joint and tripping on ecstasy - a few times she reached around and just shoved the joint in my mouth. She finally threw up, none hit us (PTL), her boyfriend apologized and took her out of there. Apparently, there was guy at that show who had a medical condition, might have been asthma, but didn't have his medication with him. He had episode/attack and ultimately passed away. I didn't see it, but his friends had communicated a message about it to Jay Lee's "Wake up and Smell the Coffee" the following Friday. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I had moved away from Houston for a good chunk of the 1990s (college, law school, first job), and moved back in June of 2001. Prior to moving back, I had flown down to visit my parents and start arrangements for my move and the cover story in the Continental Airlines magazine was all about Enron and how great a future it would have. I remember thinking to myself, damn, I need to apply for a job there. Glad I didn't do that. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Seeing that Piper Kerman is an advocate for women prisoners/inmates, I thought this story was relevant because it highlights one of the greatest sins of the criminal "justice" system in the US, which was sentencing minors as adults. This is a real life example of a 14 year old girl who is sentenced to an adult maximum security prison in Florida. Did you listen to the story? If not, I highly recommend it. I disabled the auto play feature, because that is annoying if you're not ready for it. Use the audio button in the second box, the Act 2 box. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In football and baseball the defenses and offenses operate in such a way that time is needed to rearrange the players on the field (in a way, baseball really doesn't have the same kind of timeouts that exist in other major US sports, it's a slow game and the manager isn't limited to how many times he can go to the mound, they are trying to limit how often the batter can step out of the box.) In other sports, the time outs allotted to each time are used for tactical reasons. But, in general, the bulk of stoppage in play is for television or for review of officiating calls.

Edit: Television takes full advantage of the time needed to rearrange players on the field in football and baseball, and the league officials won't mess with that because television contracts are big source of revenue. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I know how it works, but I prefer to give money directly cause 1. They know best what food items they need, and 2. Money can be used to keep the lights on. I've worked in nonprofit before and know how hard it is to come by money that can be used for overhead, and if you cannot afford to take care of that, you won't be able to carry out your mission. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Based on the on air report this morning, the negligence claim is that the owner of the property knew that a fire had been burning inside the walls for several hours before calling 911. To give some local perspective, this place was a dump in a high crime area, wouldn't be surprised if the owner took advantage of the fact that there was a fire and wanted it to go up in flames. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Back in the late 80s and early 90s, West Oaks was my go to mall for most of my shopping (with Sharpstown a close second). Been a long time since I've gone to West Oaks, but last time I was there, was shocked how dead it seemed. [I also remember when Memorial City Mall was dead and Town   Country Mall was packed, now Town   Country is gone, but Memorial City has been revived.] </TEXT>
