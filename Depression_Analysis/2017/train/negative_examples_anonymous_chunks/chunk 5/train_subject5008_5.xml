	<TEXT> The state graph was to show that STATEWIDE public transportation usage is only about 300k. The Boston graph shows 1/3 of approx 300k daily commuters use public transport (ie. approx 100K). There are about 3 million commuters in the state. The point being that arguments about Millions or even 500K commuters using the MBTA are completely false. If people want to raise the gas tax to pay for the MBTA instead of raising fares, it is pretty relevant that 80% of state commuters drive and far less than 10% use the T. $2.10 to ride from Braintree to Alewife or Oak Grove plus a bus transfer is a pretty outragious deal. </TEXT>

I'm directly quoting the MBTA, if they mean each time someone pays a fare it certainly doesn't sound like it. Like I said above, the FEDs say only 300k people commute using public transpo in the whole state.

	<TEXT> My point was that you cannot say "the T helps drivers by reducing congestion on the roads" without conceding that drivers help the MBTA by reducing congestion on the T. My point about MBTA fares was that raising the gas tax solely to pay for the MBTA would be just as unpalatable for drivers, as raising fares and using the funds to solely pay for roads would be to MBTA riders. Indexing the gas tax would save about a max of 100 mil a year (not all of which would go to the MBTA by the way), whereas my proposal of 1% income tax earmark and 20% fare increase would raise about 300 mil. It would also actually come from the people using the service. Never mind getting the spending on pensions and salary under control. Interestingly, payments for materials, supplies and service rise at 6.3% annually while pensions rise at 8.2% and wages rise at 14.2%. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> And people driving reduces the burden on the MBTA. Try convincing people in Pittsfield that they should pay more for the MBTA. 20% of ALL STATE SALES-TAX already goes to the the MBTA. Increasing fares and sales tax in Suffolk (and perhaps Norfolk and Middlesex) counties would put the burden on those who most benefit from the MBTA. If the state-highway system begins to fail to meet its obligations, you won't find me arguing about raising tolls, the gas tax, or sales-tax out outlying counties. Would you support raising MBTA fares to pay for highways in western mass? That's a lot what all this gas-index stuff sounds like. Besides, if the legislature wants to raise the gas tax they can do it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The VAST majority of people the people prescribed opioids legally never become addicted and most addicts did not start with a legal prescription. I have had numerous opioid prescriptions in the past for injuries and surgeries. Never became addicted because I followed doctor's instructions and I'm not a weak bitch (you are correct, some people are  built differently, they're called pussies and they become addicts). I am sincerely glad every time a piece of shit junkie dies because it saves myself and other taxpayers from paying for their bullshit. Its funny, not a single person I have known in my personal life has EVER become an addict, and yet I deal with them professionally every day. If your friends end up junkies it probably reflects on you more than anything else. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Man, this professional athlete was just in that 0.001%? WOW. Now, to be serious here, I agree with you. The majority of women can function just fine on their period. That's a pretty good reason not to blame your failures ON YOUR period. It goes pretty far towards confirming, in the minds of some, negative stereotypes about women. TL:DR if you want to be thought of as an equal don't blame your failure to perform on your menstrual cycle. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This article is framed as a woman, supported by a man, having greater freedom to pursue her passion. This is an issue, however, that isn't really related to gender at all. It is the recognition of the fact that money gives one the freedom to pursue passions that might otherwise fall the wayside. This is something that really needs to be drummed into the heads of kids these days. There is a whole lot of lip service to "Follow your dreams!!" but the reality is that many passions like sports, music, and art rarely turn into a lucrative career. When a middle class kid proclaims that they are going to be a poet, someone shouldn't tell them to pursue it at any cost, but rather encourage them and temper the encouragement with advice to develop a more conventional source of income. If someone wants to be a starving artist, good on them, but it should be made clear from the start that this is what where they are likely to end up if they follow their passion to the exclusion of all others. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In Worcester of all places! I think this has to do with overall parking availability. In places where there is always SOMEWHERE you can park so long as you shovel (ie Worcester, Rozzie(?)) space savers may have a place. In areas where parking is ALWAYS severely limited (Southie), it just privatizes a public resources and wastes everyone's time. I wonder if the culture of space savers could date to a time where the parking situation in Southie was more similar to that in Worcester. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The same could be said for our system of taxation. That said, I don't believe in space savers....BUT I don't think the only thing that keeps it in place is fear. I won't move a saver after a huge storm because I respect the effort to shovel the space out. If someone just throws it down for a dusting I'll probably move it and park there....though in that case a fear of vandalism does play a role in my decision making.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Estimates vary, I was going with a lower estimate of 1 million. Still, it should be noted that the soviets killed about 100000 civilians a year while NATO killed roughly 400 civilians a year with more troops in country (at peak) and achieving a greater degree of success. Something to remember whenever "whataboutism" rears its head. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well during the soviet occupation of Afghanistan roughly 100,000 civilians were killed per year. During the following civil war period roughly 40,000 civilians were killed per year. During the NATO occupation roughly 1,400 civilians were killed per year. Of those, 1/4 were killed by NATO troops. If you were to speculate that without NATO intervention the civil war period would have continued (14X40000)-(14X1400)= you would conclude that over half of a million Afghan civilian lives were saved by NATO intervention. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It would be nice if people just took responsibility to shovel their own shit and not fuck someone over. I spent several hours shoveling out my car in 4-5 ft drifts here in Worcester.  I did NOT leave a space saver. When I came back at the end of the day no one had taken it, but some people had shoveled out new spots for their own cars. Same thing happened again today, no space saver, no one took my spot. I figured pay it forward and shoveled out another space. </TEXT>
