	<TEXT> Okay. Calories in, calories out. 

If you eat a calorie surplus due to this really cool cheese that I found at Trader Joes, you will gain just as much weight as with an identical calorie surplus caused by an episode of wearing carb goggles. The ketogenic diet is a good tool because being in ketosis induces a loss of appetite. It sounds like you're experiencing emotional eating, meaning you eat even when you are not hungry. You need to face your fears and grow some balls (wait you are female so that saying will not motivate you). Just track your macros. Fuck. Alright. I don't think my text will motivate you, so I will have to motivate you some other way. [Billy Corgan is watching you and judging you.](http://vos.lavoz.com.ar/files/imagecache/lvivos_nota_652_366/nota_periodistica/13_Jun_2012_16_18_07_billy-corgan-2012.jpg) If that doesn't motivate you, nothing will.  </TEXT>

Calories are a *limit,* not a goal. If you're not hungry, don't eat. 

I have been diagnosed with anorexia and have struggled with bulimia (no formal diagnosis), so I know my shit.
