	<TEXT> I'm sorry to see them swap out the main female lead

This might change your mind.

The plot is based around a incident in Sioux Falls in the 1970s. This incident involved Molly's father (Lou) and is canonical to the series, infact it was referenced in season 1 several times. So while it will have a new set of leads, there are plenty of references to keep the series whole :)

I'm really fucking excited for this one.

	<TEXT> How has no one referenced the [Beck v Eiland-Hall case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beck_v._Eiland-Hall) of 2009. This is honestly one of the funniest things you'll read.

A satirist used Glenn Becks obnoxious style of 'journalism' to insinuate that Glenn Beck raped and murdered a girl in 1990.

It's insanely funny and he ended up winning the suit. It also ended up becoming a rather amusing example of the Streisand Effect.

Australia is inconsistent at times. 

We pronounce 'Route' as 'Root' but we don't call a 'Router' a 'Rooter'.

Americans have us beat on that I guess.

For further hilarity, *root* is slang for sex in Australia.

	<TEXT> She didn't know what a blowjob was.

So I first heard the word 'blowjob' in the school yard and in my innocence I asked my brother what it meant. He being the older sibling told me to ask our mum (prick was fucking with me). I asked mum, with literally no idea what it was and she said "Oh I have no idea". I went through life happy with the notion that my mum has never heard of oral sex before.

Years late this story took a more R rated revision, much laughter was had and all of it was at my expense.

**Edit: I want to follow that up with a nicer story**, growing up I had a very active imagination and I used to get really horrible and vivid nightmares. It was rather crippling. I had one reoccuring one where I would dream about a monster in my closet. I had this dream several times a week and my mother rushed into my room asking what was wrong, I tearfully told her about my dreams so she said she was going to get the *monster spray*. "What's *monster spray?*" I asked "You've never heard of this? It's a old family secret for getting rid of those nasty monsters". 

So she took this unlabeled water spray bottle and sprayed the closet. I had never slept better after that. I got placebo'd and I love her for it. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I was asked something last night which made me think. Someone asked "Woah, why are you in such a good mood?". It's a simple enough question, but upon thinking about it...


This has been a good fucking week.  


First, I finally had my **whoosh** and dropped a chunk of weight. This drop brought me down to a BMI of 35 (that's 6 bmi points since I started 3 months ago), that's 38 lbs dropped and 4 inches off my waist.

Also, a friend who noticed my weight loss referred to me as 'ravishing'. That one hit home :)

This surge of awesomeness gave me some serious motivation and I've been hitting the gym with more fervor then ever. I had initially been doing a 4 mph fast walk for 45~ minutes with small 5 mph jogging increments, this week I was able to have a total of 15 minutes of jogging into my 45~ minute work out. This is without any soreness or discomfort [(Here is the FitBit graph for that workout, I love me some data)](http://i.imgur.com/d4UGzZn.png). I can actually take on stairs without any shortness of breath. Adding to this, after Mondays workout while stretching my calves I noticed a dude staring at my calves. He then said "nice calves man", as a straight guy, I'm not used to getting random dude compliments - it was pretty awesome.


And finally, nearly 3 months ago I had a physical with my doctor, where I announced that I was going to lose weight. She was supportive and gave me lots of information to help me, but she had this weird tone in her voice, like she had heard this 1000 times before and she was almost reading off a script. She kept on mentioning for me to manage expectations and ensure discipline and all that stuff. I knew even then that this time was different than the other times. I knew I could do this. I still can't explain why.

So yesterday was our 3 month follow up to discuss my progression and do any further blood work (had worries about my iron levels, turns out I'm ok! :D). She was beyond excited to see my progress, she admitted that she constantly see people who can't follow through and it's rare to see such spontaneous progress without some sort of mortal danger precursor. According to her, she wants to *bottle me up for her other patients*.

One of the things she asked was where I get my motivation and accountability from. I told her that I'm accountable to myself but as far as support and motivation goes, I proudly nominated reddit. I explained to her /r/loseit, /r/progresspics and /r/fitness. She had never heard of them but upon hearing about it exclaimed that she will for sure pass on these links to her other patients.

Thank you guys for being awesome. 

Regards,

train_subject5967, that dude with the ravishing calves.

	<TEXT> This isn't about me, it's about my sister. She married a guy about 4 years ago and had a kid 2 years ago with him.

The thing about his side of the family, is that the mother is a controlling bitch and has my sisters husband under her thumb. Initially when they agreed to get married, they were both living with his mother (lets call her **Attila the Mum**). That was a little dysfunctional since he was well into his 20s. But what ever.

Since they've had the kid though, my sister has been trying to move out and start their own life away from his family. You know, like normal people. But Attila won't allow that.

She has him under her control so much, that he's actually convinced he's not capable of living away from home. This ended up causing a rift where my sister couldn't take it anymore so she gave him the reasonable ultimatum *"We're married, we either move out together or we break up."*

He chose his fucking mother. Unbelievable. Since this split, my sister has been living with my parents temporarily (my parents promoted a healthy attitude towards moving out asap). This whole thing has been beyond awful and now we're getting all of this bullshit where *doctors* that Attila knows have stated that my sister is an unfit mother and that she should be with Attila.

Now that really makes my fucking blood boil, my sister is the most kinda hearted mother I know, she has wanted to work in child care as far as I can remember. 

Long fucking story fucking short. I wish my sister had thought more about marrying and having a child with someone who is still by all accounts - a child. I honestly can't even fathom parents who actively keep their kids from moving out. It's your responsibility to prepare them for the real world you fucking narcissists.

**TL:DR my sister is regretting not giving further scrutiny to her new family before getting married.** </TEXT>

But lets say that TWOW comes out before season 6 (here's hoping :D), that means that we won't be spoiled for any TWOW content.

We're still going to have the show spoil the last part of the story as the show will be long finished before ADOS. So while it's good that in delaying TWOW info this season, we have been given a reprieve from spoilers for TWOW. It is just that, a reprieve. We're still going to see the show's adaptation of the series finale :( </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey guys


So I've been more avid of late to hit the gym, this has consisted of 2-4x 45 minute long cardio sessions per week.

Initially it was just fast walking, but I started adding bouts of jogging here and there and before I knew it, I was doing 2x 5 minute jogs in my 45 minute session. 

The other week I started getting some pain in my ankles and foot arches. I realised the main culprit.

My running shoes.

They were old and most certainly not longer doing their job for me amping up my efforts. I went out and spent $200 on a new pair which were fitted for my and **holy shit** has that made a difference.

The first session back with my new shoes I ran 2x 10 minute jogging without any discomfort at all. I'm now far more comfortable increasing my efforts as time goes on. 

Do yourself a favour and invest the money, it will make a difference :) </TEXT>

Honestly, I am. I'm at such a stable part of my life. 27, almost saved enough for a house, my career is solid and I have a permanent job doing what I love. 

There were only two things which were actively bothering me. One was my weight and the other was finding myself a lady. These two issues tend to go hand in hand.

I've been working on my weight for the past 3 months, I'm down 16 kgs and I'm working on my fitness.

In a little bit, ill go back into the dating scene with some confidence and find me a lady :)

Please don't respond by saying "finding a girl won't make you happy, blah blah". I am happy, but I would be happier in a relationship. I left my last relationship a while ago because I wanted to be single to focus on my career. I'm done with that, I want to settle down.

	<TEXT> Its a motivator that the OP likely used often to deal with his weight loss. 

Hypothetical - Lets say the OP has a dog, and walking that dog every day is his personal way to deal with his weight loss. If one day dogs were outlawed and he made a post on /r/loseit talking about how he thinks that the dog removal will affect his loss, would you have a problem with that post?

/r/loseit is totally a place where people can air their grievances and who knows, perhaps someone can point the OP towards something which can work as an alternative to his **dog**.

If he had made a post saying "I'm sad /r/fatpeoplehate was banned because I liked making fun of fatties", then I would be right on board with you. He's just a guy/girl who wants any help he/she can get with their struggles. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not using it, but people at /r/loseit swear by it. I primarily use guestimation for my diet. I eat around 1800-2000 calories a day. My dinner is pretty much the same thing, with some variation on the side dishes and since I only eat twice a day - this makes having a consistent caloric input much easier.

My biggest piece of advice is to focus on what you eat, the second you realise that weight loss is 80% diet and 20% exercise, that's when you see how easy it actually is. Eat less to lose fat, exercise to get healthy.

It's also important that the word 'diet' is defined. 'Diet' shouldn't be a temporary thing. It's a change of lifestyle. What you're doing now, you need to do for the rest of your life. So when you make this 'diet' of yours, it's important to not exclude **anything**. Just have less of it.

You love the taste of french fries with your dinner? Then eat them with your dinner, just make sure you allow it into your daily caloric budget. What you'll realise after doing this is that the foods you love are likely caloric gold mines and you didn't even realise it. That has turned me off quite a few of the foods I used to love.

Also, avoid having cheat days. Instead have unplanned cheat *meals*. I do this often and it helps my sanity. Last night I caught up with some friends and had a meal at a resturant, today I'm back at eating normally and my efforts are hardly worsened.

The final thing I would add, is control what you drink. I've been pretty much booze free for the past 3 months and I think that's the biggest assistance I've had. I drink nothing but water (save for a coffee here and there) and that's made a huge difference.

Definitely hang around /r/loseit, /r/progresspics, /r/fitness or if you're like me /r/fatlogic may also help motivate you. Warning, /r/fatlogic isn't for everyone. If you get motivation to keep doing what you're doing then it's good, if you end up feeling like shit, it's probably not for you.

The thing is that I had a huge amount of weight to lose (started at 285) so much of the weight I have lost is likely visceral fat which obviously doesn't show on the outside. I'm down 3 belt buckles and 2 shirt sizes though :)

 but I'm already starting to feel better

The second I hit 18, my brother and I joined a pool club and have been playing ever since. While my brother has fallen out of love with it, I'm still intensely passionate about it and could play for days.

If there is a pool table at a party or pub, i'll be there shootin. I don't hold back, no matter how good or shit you're :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Pretty much impossible, definitely unhealthy.

Some snap calculations to prove it. To lose 15 pounds in 3 weeks (15*3500)/21 you would need to have a deficit of 2500 calories per day. Meaning you would need to eat 2500 less than your daily expenditure. After putting your information into a TDEE calculator, even with setting it to "intense exercise every day" your expenditure is 2811, so you'd have to eat only 311 calories a day. Which is a great way to kill yourself.

I did this math just to give you context for how weight loss works. Set realistic goals :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I love the enthusiasm! Let your motivation turn into discipline over time!

Something I will add is to remind you that weight loss is mostly due to diet. So if you feel that exercise 5 days a week is too much, don't burn yourself out over it. Stay on top of what you eat and exercise as much as you can handle! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yikes, glad you're ok.

This is something I have to worry about. My paternal grand father died of a heart attack at 38 and his son (my paternal uncle) survived a heart attack  at 38. I'm 27 at the moment and no way am I going to let myself go through that with them. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm 3 months in and while I've been doing cardio, I've been holding off from doing any strength training till I lost more.

I did my first bout with strength training on the weekend and I had no idea how weak I was. Pushups, situps, planking, squats and lunges. They all showed me how unfit I was haha

But I think it's important to start right away. 

If you're like me, then you're currently kicking yourself that you didn't start losing weight earlier. It's the exact same with exercise. I don't want to be at my ideal weight months from now and think "Why didn't I start training sooner? I've lost months of progression".
