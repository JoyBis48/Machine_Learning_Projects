	<TEXT> Crystals - mainstream hit. Pleasant yet different. 

Human -  nice lyrics and a little upbeat. 

Hunger -  Same as human.  Definitely a little more of a tune. 

Wolves with teeth -  Honestly I feel this is my favorite song.  A nice different vibe.  Good song to throw off the vibe of the other songs. 

Empire -  great lyrics and nice upbeat tune. 

Slow Life -  I feel most are gonna let this slip through the cracks.  It honestly is a gem of a song.  A little slower but lyrically great

Organs -  probably the next hit.  Lyrically sublime where I feel instrumentality,  the band reached the deepest.  Integration of the cello was just a treat. 

Black water -  kinda takes me back to MHIAA. 

Thousand Eyes -  Slow start up but a great entry into eye of the storm.  Cool drum sequence that actually is pretty intense. 

I of the storm -  My favorite single.  This song is lyrically deep and actually quite similar IMO to crystals. Awesome song. 

We sink - One of the more fun songs on the album. 

In all the album is everything I anticipated.  I saw them Saturday so that made this all the more worth it. I feel like they artistically didn't venture out like I wished but lyrically I feel it was deeper.  The songs are quote repetitive in sound but each demands it's own identity. Another great album by an amazing band.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I really honestly love every song.  Wolves without teeth is fun!  Slow life is just as good as any. Thousand eyes is intense and is an amazing build up. Organs is sick as any hit.  Same with humans. 

Only issue is that lot of songs sound repetitive. But that's like being fed cake over and over again. Kind of a good problem to have!  My favorite right now is probably wolves.  </TEXT>

You were already admitted.  They gave you a contract that states as long as you don't get/do "X"  you will be attending in the fall. Your GPA already got you in.  Unless it states anywhere in your contract of a GPA requirement (which to my knowledge it doesnt)  you are fine.

Contract states that you must attain at least C's on your final classes. Sounds like you did that.  </TEXT>

This guy is super emotional and I feel mentally unstable.  Nobody considers him relevant.  All he is is a roadblock to bigger fights.

	<TEXT> OMAM is my favorite band.  I love MHIAA more than I can explain...  Nanna is gorgeous and their style was slick.  I heard crystals and thought WTF...  They sold out.  I was pissed off. Listened to it a few times and it grew on me. As did every single they put out (except I of the storm.  I loved that immediatly) They are growing and they changed. For the better.  Nanna and Raggie said this was a chance to open up.  *this* is the real OMAM.  I love it. Keep listening and you will too.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This band really sets the bar high for artists...  Their show was incredible. They made the audience be involved which was sick.  The bands chemistry is incredible. They all rotated to the front and lead at least once. Played every song you wanted to hear and even played the whole band on one guitar deal.  It was sick.  I've been to a ton of festivals including cali roots a few weeks ago...  This had been the best concert yet. Go if you haven't..!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> "Stop Mr. Jones!!!!", I screamed.  It was all to real.  I couldn't believe that it happened again.  My stuffed bear was touching my penis again. Mr. Jones was a beige colored stuffed bear with a missing button eye. Oh how he was a friend of mine.  We used to do everything together.  Fish,  hike,  sleep.  Man we were inseparable.  Then as we got older,  Mr. Jones became to close.  He would whisper obscenities in my ear as I slept like "Leonardo will never get an Oscar." or "Just do it!  Yesterday you say tomorrow,  so just.....  DO IT!". One time I woke up and I saw Mr.  Jones playing with himself watching me as I slept.  Sure I was wearing some nice,  comfortable, elastic less,  tag-less Hanes underwear with a logo of Space Jam on it. Mr.  Jones whispered under his breath.... "what's up doc". Mr. Jones copulated with me that night. As he pulled down my Hanes underwear that you can find at any target store for about $7.99 for a pack of 3, I realized that I had the slightest erection. It wasn't extremely high like you get when wearing a pair of Jordan high top sneakers, which you can find for appx. $100 at your local shoe store. No,  this erection let me know that I was ready to jam my piece into Mr. Jones. I slept that night. I awoke a new man.  Rejuvenated!  Alive!  Revived like a man who was worn down but had a fresh glass of Gatorade, which is a high performance energy drink engineered to allow you to perform at you peak ability which you can buy at any store for $3.00. I felt like I was set to explode! Like the Charlotte Bobcats will once we establish a firm grip on our front office direction,  which tickets can be purchased at www.nba.com/bobcats. Ticket prices may vary.  So come see us!!!"
