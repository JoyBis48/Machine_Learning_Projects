	<TEXT> Well I did not say that it is affordable. I just said that you don't need to to go for all the bells and whistles.  Going to an instate school full time can cost close to 20k a year.  It is really not possible to work your way through school with that kind of price tag.  

You do the math and you figure out the only way you can pay for that is if you have a full time job that pays much more than minimum wage.  I don't know how anyone could hold a full time job while also going to school full time.  

If you think part time is the answer than get ready to be going to school for the next 12 years of your life.  I really doubt that is practical.

Once you figure all that up you realize why so many kids are taking out loans to pay for college.  It is a smart calculation based on opportunity cost. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> ~~That is good and I think that can help the movement, but i don't think he is it's representative or leader, at least not yet.  Its not like news stations call up Sharpton to ask what his plans are for the future of the movement.~~  Think about it if somebody wanted to talk to the head of the movement, who would they talk to.  In my opinion there is not currently a true head of this movement.  The biggest thing that could make a difference to this movement is if they got a leader like MLK was to the civil rights movement in the 60's.  They need a guy that can e the face of their cause and give it a voice and a direction.  So when people think of the movement, they automatically think of that guy.

	<TEXT> I also agree I feel like riots happen when frustration reaches a breaking point.  People are can only put up with so much before they say enough is enough.  This is especially true when they feel like conventional means for getting things done are just giving them the run around.  People get tired of the BS.  

Whats too bad is the current movement lacks any real leadership.  This lack of leadership means there is nobody to give the cause a single voice.  This makes the movement disorganized easy to criticize (because there is no representative to defend the movement) and prone to violence and when violence does break out, it comes across as pointless and just people that are looking for an excuse to destroy stuff and steal things, not people mad over social injustice.

	<TEXT> There is a difference between being innocent until proven guilty and being above the law.  Innocent until proven guilty means they can't put you in prison until they have proven you guilty of a crime in court.  Investigating and charging someone with a crime does not make them guilty.  The media seems to have a hard time understanding this, that just because you have been arrested does not make you guilty.

I am saying that it is ridiculous that this kind of thing gets swept under the rug and no investigation is launched and no charges are made when it is obvious that there was wrong doing.  A guy getting a broken neck while sitting in jail does not just happen.  If this happened anywhere else it would be considered a murder and investigated as such.  Why does the same not hold true in a jail cell.

Expecting an investigation and calling this a murder is not in contradiction to innocent until proven guilty. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So I am getting into the hobby, I purchased a used quad a few months ago and enjoy flying it, but now i want to do some airplanes as well.  With my quad the KK2 board has an alarm and voltage meter hooked in so when the voltage gets low the alarm starts to ring and i know to land.  My question is how do you keep from under volting your LIPO on an airplane, that does not have a control board?

	<TEXT> I have not, I have sailed Lasers, Sunfish, 420s, and FJs.  Slightly larger boats I have sailed have been Flying Scotts and Thistles.  Out of those  I would say Sunfish is my favorite but I am also biased.  If you have sailed 420's or FJ's I would say both the Sunfish and the Laser feel like a faster more agile boat than either of those.  The 420 is like driving a truck, where the Laser and Sunfish are more like go-karts.  I saw somebody suggest going and borrowing or renting them and seeing what they are like.  I think that is a good suggestion.  Again though, make sure they are in good condition otherwise it wont give you he right impression of the boat.

As for the downsides of the two boats, the Laser is tipsy because of its round hull and when sailing especially in heavy wind, you never really get a break.  The Laser is also not that great for carrying more than one person, because the coordination gets hard with the boat being tipsy.  I would say the Sunfish is good on both of these points.  

The Sunfish on the other hand is slightly slower than the laser, and due to the lateen rig can not point quite as high.  Both of these are really only noticeable when you are sailing next to a Laser or maybe if you have gotten used to the characteristics of sailing a laser.

Thats really all I can think to tell you.  You probably all ready know this but when buying a sunfish or a Laser, you should not bother with a boat that has any leaks.  I know in the sunfish the foam on the inside and the fiberglass absorbs the water and really weigh the boat down, even after you have drained it.  The hull on a new sunfish weighs 120 pounds so if you go look and a Sunfish and it weighs a ton than it is not worth buying, a Sunfish should be easy to pick up with two people.

Thats really all I can think of, is the Laser Pico similar to the 420 or the FJ?  What other boats have you sailed maybe I can help give you a compassion. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> An important thing with getting a sunfish, is making sure you get a good one. You can buy a sunfish for 800 bucks, but it is going to leak be heavy, and sail slow.  I love Sunfish, but i have sailed ones like this and they suck.  Even with good wind they just sit there.  On the other hand a Sunfish in good condition sails great.  They are fast, and even plain on reach in good wind.  Make sure if you get a Sunfish it is in good condition, and i would suggest looking for one with a racing rig as they have some features that make them go faster.  

The main thing is don't get those cheap Sunfish.  They will be a big disappointment, and i would hate to see you get a bad impression of the boat because you got one of those crappy water logged ones. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The apples to apples comparison is with the sail attached to the spars.  No sunfish sailor ever takes the sail off the spars you put the spars and the mast together and roll the sail, and then the whole thing goes into the bag.  That is how everyone does it.  Sunfish sailors are taking perfectly good care of their sails.  Your example of wrapping the sail around the mast would be comparable to leaving rig and sail on the boat and just putting the sail beneath the boat cover.

With lasers it makes more sense to take the sail off the mast because it just slips off the top. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you have never sailed a Sunfish before, the sail is attached to the spars with either plastic clips, or small ties.  Anybody i have ever met just puts the spars together and rolled up the sail.  It would be pretty silly to take the sail off the spar every time you de-rigged.  It would take at least an hour, and then you would have to reattach it again the next time which would take another hour.  Because you would have to go through and undo every one of those ties/clips.  There really is no downside to leaving the sail attached either, if you roll the sail right, it should not be detrimental to the sail.  you do not wrap the sail around the spars, you roll it up next to the spars, so there is really no wrinkles or pressure points on the sail. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It seems like there are a lot of people that like lasers on here.  I am a fan of Sunfish, I have sailed both, and it is true that lasers are fast.  What I like about sunfish though is they are not so much work to sail.  The more square hull makes them much more stable than a laser and not so much of a work out.  Also in my opinion the Sunfish is a tougher boat than the Laser.  The Laser is all about speed, and because of that the hull is thinner, and also rounded.  I have had collisions while racing Sunfish that probably would have punched a hole in a Laser,  I can't even find a ding on the gelcoat on my sunfish afterwords.  As to speed, the sunfish is not slow in my opinion, but it is slower than a Laser.  

To sum things up if you like speed and are looking for a sports car the Laser is probably better.  If you are looking for a more laid back fun boat that is easier to rig, more about sailing, and less about fine tuning everything, the Sunfish might be better.  That laid back atmosphere continues to the people who sail them.  Some of the nicest sailers i have met have been other sunfish sailers. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Are you referring to MH370 and German Wings as the two crashes caused by pilots?  There is no proof right now that MH370 was caused by the pilots.  Second I think especially in the case of German Wings, the problem was procedure.  In the US there are always 2 people in the cockpit.  This is for safety reasons when opening the door.  The pilot is supposed to check to see that is the pilot asking to be let in, but if he is the only one in the cockpit how can he without leaving nobody at the controls. You can never fully screen out crazy people from the system, that is why smart procedures are important.  In many crashes it is very simple to just blame the pilots even when there is evidence that it was not the pilots fault. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Airlines_Flight_811#Personal_investigation,

Video explaining the latch issue and how Boeing blamed ground handlers: https://youtu.be/7n8JIbMF0og?t=31m58s


http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_737_rudder_issues This is a list of incidents caused by faulty valves for the rudder causing the rudder to go hard over.

Many of these crashes were originally blamed on the pilots, including a few that were blamed on pilot suicide.

I am not saying German Wings was caused by the pilots, but often times it is much easier and there is a financial incentive for the investigation to find the pilots at fault. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Maintenance does not have to erase the recorder, there is a button in the cockpit that you push.  If you push and hold the button for two seconds, provided the plane is on the ground and the parking break is engaged, it will erase the flight voice recorder, but not the data recorder.  

I could be a little out of date now, but from what i understand this feature was hard fought by unions when voice recorders were being introduced.  The unions wanted to make sure the voice recorders would only be used in crash investigation, and not be used by management to police pilot performance.  So if you are parked at the gate after the flight you can erase the voice recorder.

You wanted a source, This is where I remember first reading about the ability to erase the voice recorder after a flight, but I have heard it from other airline pilots as well.
At one station, two women are assembling control panels for cockpit voice recorders. Theres the erase button, says John Kerwin, vice president of operations. Ive never met a pilot yet who believes it works, but it does. And that illuminates one major problem with the idea of streaming data from aircraft in flight, at least as it pertains to cockpit audio: the near certainty that pilots will never stand for it. By law, cockpit voice recordings may be accessed only by investigators after an accident. When a flight arrives safely at the gate, the pilot hits the erase button. (It wont work in flight or during taxiing.) In the event of an accident, transcripts may be released as part of a report but not, as a rule, the actual recording. This is partly a matter of professional pride, partly to spare the feelings of pilots families if they are killed. But primarily it seems to be a labor-management issue. The Air Line Pilots Association, the aviators union, mobilized last year to fight a bill that would allow airlines to use voice and data recorders to evaluate the performance of cockpit crews

	<TITLE> Why do the cockpit voice recorders not have a longer loop? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-04-25 04:47:45 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I saw a post over at /r/MH370 talking about how they were disappointed that even if the plane was found and black boxes recovered, it was likely that the voice recorder would not say much because it will have most likely looped over.  My question is why is the loop on the voice recorder so short?  Wouldn't it make sense to have the loop be 10 or maybe even 20 hours so that it is impossible for it too over write during a normal flight?  

It just seems like this has happened a few times where the voice recorder has over written and it makes it a lot harder to understand what happened.  

It also seems like storage space should not be an issue, new micro SD cards are as large as 120 GB so even with special designing to make the hard drive crash resistant, it seems like it should not be that hard to get a hard drive that has enough space for a few hours of audio recording.

	<TEXT> Well now we pretty much know exactly what happened to Air France 447 because we have recovered the plane and its black boxes.  

Before we actually found the plane we had a basic idea.  We knew that the weather had been kind of stormy and that in the events leading up to the crash the plane had sent automated messages saying there were certain problems onboard like the pitot tubes(the sensors that say your airspeed) were not functioning properly.  So the best guess was somehow the stormy weather had brought down the plane.  We also found debris on the ocean confirming that it had crashed.    

After finding the plane and recovering the black boxes a much more complete picture was created revealing that the storm had caused the pitot tubes to freeze over causing erroneous airspeed readings and causing the plane to send the automated messages.  that was just the seed of the crash.  The events that actually caused the crash stemmed off of that and were much more complicated.  Most of the reasons for the crash were the pilots being confused about what the planes instruments were actually telling them and what the plane was actually doing (the plane never said airspeed reading bad it just gave them erroneous readings) bad design of the cockpit(the joysticks for the two pilots in an airbus plane can move in two different directions at the same time unlike almost every other aircraft made.  During the crash one pilot was holding back the his joystick which was overriding the imputes from the other pilot the pilots did not realize this was happening for a long time, and only added to their confusion.) and many more factors

Boat propellers have a nylon ring on the inside so that when your prop hits something the nylon breaks, breaking the connection between the prop and the motor preventing it from ruining your engine.  All you have to do then is go buy a new prop.

	<TEXT> Besides the tons of errors about flying(No you don't lay the hammer down going through a storm, quite the opposite), it perpetuates the fictitious belief that pilots are a bunch of unprofessional hotshots.  The kind of behavior that Denzel showed in the movie (sleeping while flying, drunk, doing drugs) would not make it anywhere in the airlines.  That kind of stuff is taken seriously if the other pilot can smell alcohol on you or suspects that you are drunk they can and are expected to report it immediately.  

Pilots are professionals and you don't get to that level in aviation without being skilled, professional and a little luck.  It is extremely hard and only the best make it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is such a stupid design by airbus.  This could not happen on practically any other airplane because when you move one control column the other one moves with it. So there can never be any confusion about what the inputs are.  Besides the freezing of the peto tubes I think this dangerous design was what propagated the confusion and caused the crash of Air France.  

They blame the pilots for not understanding the situation, but imagine how confusing it is for everything to be going haywire, and on top of that the inputs you think you are giving the plane are not actually what the plane is receiving.  It pisses me off that they just swept that under the rug. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yea I have not gotten to complex airplanes yet, but I feel bad for this guy.  Quick thinking by the guy, but I would be very worried about the damage done to the airplane doing a go around like that, very lucky in my opinion. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A guy landed with his gear up and realized it just as his belly touched the runway, so he added power and went around.  Obviously that makes it sound a lot simpler than what he did in the video. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They might be but I doubt it.  You also have to remember that the heating that the booster is experiencing is quite low, it does not even need a heat shield compared to the heats that the engines experience during a burn, the heat from reentry is much less significant.  

The reason the heat is so much lower is because the rocket is moving much more slowly than a vehicle entering from orbit.

Most of the stresses the booster experiences on its way to a landing are actually aerodynamic stresses not thermal. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It is not that hard to do it correctly.  A perfect example is the Saturn 5 compared to an atlas rocket, or even more extreme the Saturn 5 compared to a rocket the size of the Falcon 1.  The Falcon 1 would be way more inefficient launching the same amount of mass than one large Saturn 5.  And yes the things you mentioned above do make it harder but certainly not anywhere close to impossible the Saturn 5 is an example of that.  

When I say do it correctly I am referring to to rockets like the Soviet moon rocket that was poorly designed and because of this lost the advantages from it being larger. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think part of the reason he was able to make the trip without getting killed was because of the gyrocopter he was flying.  Wether he planned it that way, or it was just luck, by using the gyrocopter(which is very small), and flying it very low and slow he was able to avoid a lot of the safety features that are used in that area.  

If he had been in a normal small plane, he would have been picked up on radar, and he would have been intercepted, it has happened many times mostly from people accidentally entering restricted airspace by accident.  Jets would have come and intercepted him warned him to change course and follow instructions, and if he had continued they would have shot him down.

Air traffic control even said that they saw him, but because his gyrocopter was so small and moving so slow they thought it was a flock of geese.

So this brings up the final point while we could probably spend billions more dollars and get a radar system in the DC area that can pick up insects.  The question is why do we need to?  A gyrocopter this small is barely capable of carrying any weight, and even if he had had malicious intent and flown it into the capital it probably would have done barely any damage to the building.  You can see [this crash of a much larger small plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002_Tampa_airplane_crash) barely did any damage to the building.  

So yea it does not look great that this guy  managed to fly his gyrocopter to the capital but considering that the risk he posed to the public was minimal I don't think that we should be going and spending even more money trying to lock down the DC are even more than it already is. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You also have to remember that a lot of times especially lately in the house, they schedule votes on stuff that has no way of going anywhere just so they can say they voted on it.  It got ridiculous with Obama care.  A couple times a month the house would vote to repeal Obama care just so they could say in the next election that they had voted to repeal Obama care.  A lot of the knowing how your congressman has voted has just created a lot of political theater. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The thing that makes me question this, is vaccines bruise you for a few days.  Its hard to imagine the mom would not notice.  If the kid is a baby than the mom would probably see the bruises and if the kid is a todler or something its hard to image the kid would not mention it, like "my arm hurts" or something like that. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I understand what you are talking about, but that is only if you use the auto pilot.  Mechjeb is not just about auto pilot though.  Mechjeb gives you a ton of data like DeltaV, thrust to weight ratio, exactly how many seconds more of fuel you have, and a lot more, and you can break the data down by stage so when you are building your rocket you can see if your stages have the appropriate thrust  and such.  Thats the kind of stuff I use Mech Jeb for anyway, I think I have only done an auto launch once or twice because I wanted to see if Mechjeb would actually do it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is sort of true, there are definitely engineering problems with scaling up, but when you do it correctly, scaling up can actually lead to a much more efficient rocket, because a larger percentage of the mass of the rocket is fuel compared to smaller rockets. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Actually a lot of these things were in the works leading up to the Colombia disaster.  They were developing liquid fueled boosters, and they were also developing more powerful versions of the solid rocket boosters.  After Colombia though NASA questioned what the purpose of the shuttle was and decided to stop developing new technology for the shuttle, and use that money to begin developing a new rocket.  In fact they might have decided to bring the shuttle to an end earlier, but they needed it to finish building the ISS. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Actually I am pretty sure that the Falcon 9 restarts its center Merlin engine 4 times.  Once for launch, once for retrograde burn to limit its downrange distance and eventually in the future bring it back to shore.  Once for reentry burn to limit its speed so it does not break up when it enters the thicker lower atmosphere, and finally the suicide burn that brings it in for landing. </TEXT>
