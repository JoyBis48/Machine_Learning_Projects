Of course not.

Your wife disappears for 48 hours, and you have not yet contacted authorities, when most people would do it within a few hours.  You haven't contacted her friends and family to ask if they've seen her or to let them know there's a problem.  Even now, you plan to contact police "tomorrow morning" waiting yet another 12 hours for no reason whatsoever.

Before contacting police, however, your main concern is to avoid suspicion on yourself.  You're asking about procedural questions for talking to police when for all you know your wife could be kidnapped, injured, or worse.  You demonstrate no concern for her safety whatsoever, only concern for yourself. </TEXT>

Please don't say lawyer up. 

It's unlikely any attorney would take this case on contingency, meaning you'd have to pay them a retainer that would likely be more than it would cost you to get the car painted. 

It's also unlikely that you'll get an entirely new paint job because they can't match the paint in the back. I don't think any judge or jury would see such a thing as reasonable.  </TEXT>

Had they followed their instructions they should have disregarded this testimony entirely since it has nothing to do with the actual charge. 

After the verdict we got to speak to several members of the jury.
