	<TEXT> I was told that I participated in vote brigading. Still not exactly sure what that means. They said I could be unbanned if I agreed not to do it anymore. I told them that I would not do it again but so far no reversal. Still whether I was wrong or not isn't the real problem, its that they just shadow banned me without any warning. If they had banned me from the sub or deleted my account I would have at least known I did something wrong and changed the way I behaved.

Small solace I can take is that this account now has way more karma then my old one ever did. </TEXT>
