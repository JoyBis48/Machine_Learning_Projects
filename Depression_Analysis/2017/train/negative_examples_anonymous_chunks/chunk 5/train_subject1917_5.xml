	<TEXT> "I would say it is the most secretive White House that I have ever been involved in covering, and that includes  I spent 22 years of my career in Washington and covered presidents from President Reagan on up through now, and I was Washington bureau chief of the Times during George W. Bush's first term. I dealt directly with the Bush White House when they had concerns that stories we were about to run put the national security under threat. But, you know, they were not pursuing criminal leak investigations," she continued. "The Obama administration has had seven criminal leak investigations. That is more than twice the number of any previous administration in our history. It's on a scale never seen before. This is the most secretive White House that, at least as a journalist, I have ever dealt with." - Jill Abramson / Jan 2014

The real reason she is no longer at NYT, IMO. NYT has become nothing more than a media arm of the Obama admin.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> And my original comment never said his point was invalid. I think your anger is really because I do not salivate at the thought of Harry Reid or Dick Cheney. I am not a Republican or Democrat. I was a person in the streets protesting the war. Protesting both parties for what they had done. I believe that both parties are culpable for our current state of affairs, including the Iraq debacle. Both sides disregarded many people from the international community that told us the intelligence was wrong. Both sides did not listen and got us involved in one the biggest foreign policy blunders in our nations history. I do not get caught up in the party paradigm so I guess its just easier for me to hold all elected officials accountable for their choices. I wanted the Bush administration investigated for war crimes. Thanks to the Obama administration we will never see that either. You fail to realize that both sides are to blame and so you come here and attack me for stating a fact. Whether his point was correct or not hes not really in a place to say anything as he is just as culpable. As I see you see things through a very biased set of eyes I feel this conversation continuing will get neither of us anywhere and just waste my time. I will forever hold both parties to blame for the Iraq debacle and nothing you say will change that. I lived it. I protested it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> How is my comment not relevant? Harry Reid is bashing Cheney, and rightfully so, for Iraq yet Harry Reid is partly to blame. He voted to authorize the use of Military force in Iraq giving Bush and Cheney the green light for their pointless war. I just find it odd that someone who gave Cheney the authority to go into Iraq is bashing him for going into Iraq.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  When a Senator is presented with evidence that grossly misrepresented going to war in Iraq (any and all WMD evidence) are you really going to blame him for it?

Yes, people should be held responsible for the decisions they make. Especially a Senator that has the power to hold those responsible for falsifying intelligence and lying to Congress yet fails to do so.

	<TEXT> Because I would expect r/politics to be unbiased views from all sides of the political spectrum. Instead r/politics has turned into r/democrats or r/obama. I am not a Republican or Democrat. I just like to see two sides of the debate. Which should be what r/politics is all about. But all you have to do is look through r/politics and understand what types of stories that are allowed to be discussed. Of course you may be biased yourself and not care or not see it. Everything in r/politics has a one sided bias towards politics. What does r/politics expect to get out of having an agenda? what do they expect to get out of everyone sitting around with the same opinions and ideas? I would call it a circlejerk. Its obvious to middle of the road people like myself. r/politics = r/democrats and if you believe otherwise you are either lying to yourself or you havent been here long enough. But you are right. Why do I continue to stay? I guess I just hoped at some point unbiased views would come along but when the moderators are so biased themselves and have their own political agendas its difficult to have have unbiased middle of the road political discussions. Moderators of r/politics flag posts right out of the gate if they do not align with the agenda of the left. Moderators downvote articles that do not necessarily break any rules but go against their personal agendas. Its sad really. I believe both sides of the political aisle are just as culpable for our current state of affairs. But you wouldnt know that reading r/politics. Not that the facts arent out there, its because anything that shows the left in a bad light gets shadow banned, pulled, or downvoted before a discussion can even take place. r/politics should promote both sides of the aisle and many opinions and ideas. If r/politics was the same towards the right I would have just as much of an issue with it. I cant stand political parties and it bewilders me how we can expect to move forward as a nation as long as we sit around in our own little circles pointing the finger at one particular party. But you have made me realize that no one in r/politics cares about the things i just mentioned so I guess you are right. I should unsubscribe and leave you all to your circlejerk.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Gross violations of our Constitution are not "minor issues" in my view. They are the most pressing issues IMO. Economic issues will work themselves out as both individuals will have a vested interest in our economy since they both rely on the economy to survive. I also believe they could find common purpose on economic issues. After what this country has gone through in terms of Constitutional violations in the last 14 years that has become my above all voting condition. Both parties have very similar overall views of economic policy. This is why policies have not changed very much in the last 30+ years. Its the issues such as Constitutional violations that have changed dramatically in the last 30+ years and have detrimental long term effects. Including on the economy. It is being speculated that the NSA revelations will cost American tech companies billions in lost revenue, annually. I believe these two men could find common purpose and do great things for the people and the Constitution of this wonderful nation. I just like to think outside the box. I mean what we have been doing surely isnt working for the people. So why not try something different? I am not a Republican or Democrat. I am just an American that cares about his country and I can see that something drastic and unrealistic may be our only chance at righting some of these wrongs. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So you believe that men that have two different core ideologies cannot find common ground move forward based on those common principles? Is that not the foundation of our government? Is Congress not setup to compromise different ideologies into one common goal or purpose. I reject the notion that just because they have different core ideologies that they couldnt come to a compromise on the best way to move the country forward. There are issues that need to be addressed such as NSA, Military engagments, NDAA, Patriot Act, etc where they could really lead the charge. The gross violations of our Constitution from both parties is appalling and I believe that as long as we continue to vote for the establishment we will get the same policies. I am just ready to think outside the box. We need men like Bernie and Rand to take on the political parties in this country. Both have a knack for going against the grain. I just believe as Americans we can do anything. We can find common ground and move our country forward. This is why I refuse to believe that these two could not find a common purpose. </TEXT>

Bush's first term. I dealt directly with the Bush White House when they had concerns that stories we were about to run put the national security under threat. But, you know, they were not pursuing criminal leak investigations," she continued. "The Obama administration has had seven criminal leak investigations. That is more than twice the number of any previous administration in our history. It's on a scale never seen before. This is the most secretive White House that, at least as a journalist, I have ever dealt with." - Jill Abramson / Jan 2014

	<TEXT> From my conversations with Dell regarding this specific type of case - Windows 8 machine with Windows 7 downgrade - this is supposed to work.  The new Dells that are set up like this no longer come with Windows 7 COA License key stickers. (and of course Windows 8 keys are stored in the bios) Dell says to use the OEM Windows 7 disk so that it will auto-populate the license key when installing Windows 7. Of course I will also recommend creating the Dell recovery disc on first boot up. Dell recovery is the best way to recreate the system as it was from the factory. But if a disc must be used OEM should do the trick.  </TEXT>

Even after the moderators looked at it the link worked. This is my biggest issue with this sub. Its clearly biased towards one party which stifles conversation on a broad range of ideas. Feinstein is a Democrat. The moderator that removed it is surely a Democrat, Feinstein supporter, or trigger happy.

	<TEXT> I cannot force a company from overseas to continue to buy my product at an increased price. I can increase wages but I have contracts on product pricing. The customers that buy my products would buy from manufacturers overseas instead because they could get them cheaper. Does that make sense? We are not a US Economy. We are a world economy. My entire business is based on customers not based in the US. If my costs go up so does my product cost. My contracts would disappear leaving my company out of business and my employees out of a job. For the record Labor is one of the largest costs of making products. you seem to shove it aside as a non existent cost. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> lol What you fail to understand is that if my labor costs change overnight I will be out of business in a month. Labor costs would be immediate. Revenue increases would not. I would be out of business before I ever saw a revenue increase. But you fail to understand that if my labor costs increase so does the cost of my product. So if the cost of goods increases where is the increase in pay? They will just be paying more for goods which would deplete any increase in pay they were afforded. You think things are black and white.. they are not. You can make it look good on paper all you want. Reality is it would be detrimental to our economy. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am sorry but how did GW have anything to do with the mosque not being built? As an American who lost friends in the towers I personally thought it was insensitive to try and build a mosque down the street from the towers. But I am not GW. And GW had nothing to do with it not being built. You some damn commie or something?

	<TEXT> I understand that if my labor costs increase my company goes out of business killing almost 1000 jobs. I do not need you or some elitist at a desk to tell me this. I see it. I experience it. It will disrupt the economy and cause even more poverty. It will cause more strain on our services. You cannot add $millions$ to my labor costs overnight and not expect a catastrophic event. My margins are so thin it would wipe us out overnight. This is reality, pal. Not some idea thought up on a university campus. </TEXT>
