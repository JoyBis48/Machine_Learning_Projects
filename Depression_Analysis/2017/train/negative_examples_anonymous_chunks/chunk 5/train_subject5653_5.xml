I have been downvoted almost 100 times because of an article I did not write which actually states nearly every single answer to the comments made here complaining about it. It answers all the things in it. 

So the writer of it officially confirming this news is not news at all? That makes no sense. </TEXT>

I said read the article, not just the first paragraph.

Why downvote this? I am right. Person did not read the article only the headline. The news is that. It was announced yesterday.
