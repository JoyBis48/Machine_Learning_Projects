	<TEXT> I'm not supporting Hillalry. I am calling out you Bernie bots that conduct this daily circlejerk on reddit about the godliness of Bernie and the Satan like behavior of Hillary. 

I can tell you I won't support Bernie though. And the reason is not him. It's you. 

A group made up of blind supporters who blather endlessly over every word he says and condemns anyone or anything that does not worship him,   is called a cult. Sorry Nancy, I'm not joining any cults today.

	<TEXT> This article says:

 At least 5,500 Coloradans crammed into a Denver gymnasium, an adjacent atrium, and lacrosse field Saturday night to hear presidential candidate and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders speak, in what is being reported as one of the biggest political rallies so far in the 2016 election cycle.

Hillary rally had an estimate of 5,500 - 7000 people. 

http://www.politicususa.com/2015/06/13/hillary-clinton-draws-biggest-crowd-2016-hopeful-nyc-rally.html

I have read three different numbers of the actual crowd but it was as large or larger than Bernie's. To say "one of the largest crowds" is very ambiguous and exaggerated on purpose.  </TEXT>

One of **his** biggest crowds. Not one of **the** biggest crowds. So he filled a high school gymnasium. Hillary had twice that many last week. 

Words like massive, astronautical, huge, and others like are being thrown about in extremely  exaggerated and misused. Have fun with your little circle jerk and watch as he fades into obscurity just like Ron Paul when you blathered over him.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I had a bankruptcy ten years ago. I thought they only stayed on your record for seven years. I thought it might be advantageous to get a credit card just to try and rebuild my credit at my bank but I was turned down. Despite having 20 grand in my account for over a year now. The reason given was my bankruptcy.

Should that bankruptcy still  be on my record and do I need to take steps to get it removed? Any other tips on how to rebuild my credit would be welcome. I do not need the credit now. I just want it to be there should I ever need it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Today's thought of the day comes in form of an observation from a fictional alien from the planet K-PAX (a great Kevin Spacey movie)


The alien from K-PAX told the psychiatrist we have no laws and no lawyers. When asked by the psychiatrist how do we know right from wrong the alien replied:

-----------------


**Every being in the universe knows right from wrong. Let me tell you something. You humans, most of you, subscribe to this policy of an eye for an eye, a life for a life, which is known throughout the universe for its stupidity. Even your Buddha and your Christ had quite a different vision; but nobody's paid much attention to them, not even the Buddhists or the Christians. You humans, sometimes its hard to imagine youve made it this far.**

	<TEXT> There are some people that seem to post only from a few sites and they do not get banned for spamming. An example of this would be a porn site. My subreddit is not a porn subreddit but many of the people that post to it, are getting reported for spam. I feel it is an attack of some sort.  Is there anyway Ii can get the same exemption for my subscribers? Or anyway I can protect these users? </TEXT>
