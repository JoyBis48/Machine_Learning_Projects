	<TEXT> It'd have to be a new character just as he is being trained, similar to the first game. He assassinates two targets in an attempt to discover where the templars have hidden the holy grail. After the second, the assassins reveal to the main character that they'd been grooming him to become the best assassin, in order to kill the pope (Assassin's creed II), just after killing the pope, the papal vault opens up as it does in the game and we see the precursors appear and when they are about to reveal the location of the holy grail the dna stream desyncronises and desmond wakes up in abstergo to an explosion in the lobby. Security rushes him to the holding cells when they are killed by a female assassin. She shoots out a window, looks out into the street below then at desmond. She says, " I knew your father, I can get you out of here. I need you to trust me." 

"Ok." 

"Just let go into the air like a bird, and remember 'nothing is real, everything is permitted'." 

The two eagle dive into a passing trash truck bed.

	<TEXT> A home video of everyone you've ever loved. You would go from immense sadness to depression to mourning, rage followed by acceptance. Then you'd begin to wonder how their lives continued after you were gone. You'd create intricate backstories of arguments and vacations, imagine them to the smallest details. Madness consumes you, you are angry but don't understand why, sad but don't understand why. You stare at the faces of strangers,numb, for an eternity. Centuries pass and you cannot quite recognize these people. Then you create a new story with them and how they were once people you loved... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Four years ago, I was stationed 550 miles SE of Bagram Air Base. We'd been doing consistent daytime flyovers of the tribal regions to the east, getting intel back to logistics. 


One day me and crew were flying the C130 on a recon and everything is peachy till we get about half way through return from the AO and we start getting peppered with small arms fire which is strange considering how high up we were. Turns out logistics screwed up and sent us over heavily populated Al Qaeda mountains. So there I am manning my console, trying to do my job and not get shot. RPGs are missing the plane by just a few feet. 



After about five minutes, we make it clear of the enemy fire and I'm able to take a breath. I look at my console and it has a 7.62 right through the middle of it. It's broken. I cal my CO over to take a look at it and he tells me that 7.62 rounds can make 30k feet. No, he said. That there is tree fiddy rounds. And I said tree fiddy? We ain't got no Loch Ness monster in al Qaeda firing no tree fiddy rounds. </TEXT>

Comedians tend to relate to each other and flock to one another, particularly before major success just as a method of survival. 

We expect them to have animosity for each other because they are/were on competing networks but their mainly like distant cousins whose paths, for the most part, parted after friendship. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's very easy to point to a recent movie trailer and say it's one of the greatest of all times. Case in point, The Wolf of Wall Street. I'm asking if you can recall a movie trailer preceeding 2010 that is truly great to look at and garners excitement for that movie.
