	<TEXT> I live in Tallahassee, FL. While I understand that legally I am obliged by the lease, receiving a note saying that I have an extra 3 days to pay rent is huge, especially for a poor college student. The current managers claim to have been there since the beginning of June, and they didn't seem to have a problem with payment on the 5th last month. Now I'm just thinking it was some sort of ploy from the previous owners now just to throw in one last monkey wrench into a sinking ship. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> New apartment complex managers are trying to apply a late fee since they changed the due date without notice. </TITLE>

	<TEXT> New apartment managers are trying to screw me by saying I owe a late fee, even though the month prior we had received a note saying that the rent due date had been changed to the 5th, with even the receptionist confirming that was the case. Paid rent on the 5th of June without issue. This month, go in to the office to pay rent on the 5th only to be informed that we owed a late fee because our rent was due on the 2nd, as per the original lease contract that was signed with the 3rd or 4th previous apartment management company. Management seems to change every couple months, so its incredibly confusing. I no longer have the original note stating the change of due date, but I'm hoping one of our neighbors still does. Any advice? </TEXT>
