They hire too many old guns from WWE and instantly make them the focal point instead of making new talent shine.  They have just made too many blunders when they could have easily done much better. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have no problem having her and Rusev break up... I just hate that they have to pair her with Ziggler.  It's the same thing that happens everytime, they have a female wrestler/manager and they put her with Ziggler when they want them to get liked or whatever.  It just seems that that is all Ziggler is good for anymore to WWE is guy to put divas with. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So the fact that Rollins has won MITB, was given the title at Mania (1st time ever btw), paired with the biggest heel stable in the company, has held the title since Mania, and has been in the main event storylines means that Reigns is getting pushed more than him?  Hmmmmm.....   </TEXT>
