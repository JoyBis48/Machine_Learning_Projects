	<TEXT> Not sure if this is allowed, but I don't really know where else to share it. Recently, while digging through the archives of my family's publishing company, I found a pile of old books by Robert Louis Stevenson, my ~great great great great grandfather.

No idea what they are worth, nor if anyone will find this interesting, but thought I would share.

[Enjoy.](http://imgur.com/a/9HjXF)

EDIT: I wish this post was more informative, but unfortunately I'm not really in touch with that side of my family. If anyone knows anything about these books, or about RLS (or my grandfather) in particular, I'd love to hear more. </TEXT>

 Hes stood down. Hes gone. Lets celebrate  this is nothing to do with Mr Blatter being honourable, he hasnt been honourable in years.
 
 Something has come out of the events of last week that has caused Mr Blatter to resign  Hes gone. At long last we can sort out Fifa. We can go back to looking at those two World Cups. If I were Qatar right now I wouldnt be feeling very comfortable. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm fine with spiders, cockroaches, junebugs, bats, sharks, you name it. Dolphins though? Fuck that. I'm convinced they're smarter than us, they just live a simpler life. 

I once volunteered at a dolphin experience place for a summer and had to go down with SCUBA gear to fix the fencing separating their enclosures. The 11 foot alpha named Khyber got hyper aggro and started jaw snapping at me. The shockwave shook my ribcage so much it felt like someone let off a grenade underwater.

They are terrifying animals. Nobody ever takes my phobia seriously, but I challenge anyone to get into a tank with a pissed off dolphin and tell me they didn't fear for their life.

(before people get on my back for working at such a cruel place, I was like 14 years old. I know now how awful it is to keep such amazing creatures penned in.) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Journalist here. 

WE. DON'T. WRITE. THE. HEADLINES.

Feel the need to make that extra clear because every time there's a sensational headline, it's the author that gets blamed for it. 99% of the time we HATE the headlines our stories are given.

Call out the sub-editors, not the authors. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Teddy Roosevelt - the original hard-ass romantic. The duality between his inner suffering from his personal losses, and the person he projected to the world, are infinitely fascinating to me. 

He sorta had this need to assure and remind everyone of his heroism, but at the same time was aware of his own limitations and listened to what his heart told him. Rare you find those qualities in the same man. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Anderson Cooper is a stellar journalist. He fucked off to Africa in his teens IIRC (bankrolled by his family, but still...). He started in journalism by answering telephones, before he made a name for himself by forging his own press pass and getting into Burma to interview the students fighting the government. After that he began stringing from war zones all over the world.

He may not be a Marie Colvin, or a Philip Gibbs, but he's legit. I dont find any reason not to like the guy. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> STORY TIME!

Freshman year in high school, my buddy got a hand job from a girl named Davina. 

She basically clapped her hands around it and rubbed up and down like she was trying to start a fire with a stick and some tinder.

Thus 'Dolphina' was born. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's not a bad idea, but it'd be damn near impossible to sell. I might give Elon a call though, just for good measure.

The Guardian has a long and storied history of breaking earth-shattering stories dating all the way back to when the Bolsheviks leaked documents exposing the Entente's imperial interests of WWI. That kind of history attracts supporters, so it's no wonder benefactors favour them. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The point is that reliance on advertising for revenue creates that conflict of interest. Hence the BBC. NPR would've been the same, and in fact started out the same IIRC.

	<TEXT> I love that people still expect separation of church and state in the media. Of course they banned their reporters from doing that. Of course, it's also wrong, but the public doesn't want to pay for news. Don't want to pay, don't expect the tenets that journalism once espoused to remain.

Signed,

Severely disgruntled journalist  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Was really hoping this would be an America's Cup reference.

For those that don't know, the Brits invited the Americans to sail against them, with the Queen looking on.

America proceeded to detroy the British by a massive margin. Thus the "America's Cup" was born.

It would take almost 180 years before anyone else beat the Americans, when Australia did it in 1981 (I think.)

So... yeah, the Brits aren't too hot on sailing against the Americans. </TEXT>
