	<TEXT> TFA don't reject the idea that poverty (etc) are crucial to student outcomes, but they believe that good teachers can mitigate this issue - which studies back up.

e.g.
http://obs.rc.fas.harvard.edu/chetty/w19424.pdf
"Using school district and tax records for more than one million children, we nd that students assigned to high-[Value Added] teachers in primary school are more likely to attend college, earn higher salaries, live in higher SES neighborhoods, and have higher savings rates"

There are many other studies and they do control for factors such as parental education, location, poverty etc.

Parents wages are the biggest determinant of a child's outcomes, but this can be mitigated by good teaching.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'd be curious to see the evidence that most TFA teachers are ineffective. The latest study I've found, from 2013, says:
TFA teachers were more effective than the teachers with whom they were compared. On average, students assigned to TFA teachers scored 0.07 standard deviations higher on end-of-year math assessments than students assigned to comparison teachers, a statistically significant difference. This impact is equivalent to an additional 2.6 months of school for the average student nationwide.

	<TEXT> I can't speak on many of the points you raise, but as someone who taught for 3 years under the British equivalent - Teach First - I can offer some opinions.

I do worry about very TF heavy schools - I think that TF'ers get better by taking advantage of the experience of more established teachers. 

I do think students can lose - to an extent. For the first 4-6 months I was an appalling teacher - I let down my students and I felt awful about it. My solution was to work longer and longer hours planning, only to arrive exhausted to teach my overprepared lesson. However, the same is true (in the UK) of many going into teaching through other routes. Most teachers in the UK do a standard PGCE where they spend a few months at uni and a school helping another teacher, then slowly taking over classes - many of them are not good teachers. In my experience, when you compared a TF'er and a PGCSE'er after one year, the TF'er was a hands down better teacher. They were in a much better situation in year two when the PGCSE teacher had entirely his own classes, and the TF'er had done so for a year.

The training isn't enough to make anyone a good teacher at the start, and if TFA is anything like TF training, then it isn't meant to be. It's about giving you the evaluating tools, and the legal knowledge to go into a school. TF'ers are expected to teach themselves to teach - by watching, reflecting and evaluating. 

It is true many leave to go into other careers, I left after 3 years (2 years being the TF mandatory course). The drop out rates in the UK are similar to that of other training routes for teachers. I actually think teachers doing other things is a good thing - I want people who have been in a classroom leading businesses and political institutions - with the will and understanding to make a change in education.

TF/TFA isn't all good, but it certainly isn't all bad - and I think it has a place in modern education. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well both signalling (Spence) and human capital (Becker) are relevant. Your Harvard degree certificate signals you are a high achieving, high skill employer - it no doubt gets you the interview. 

If you are entirely fraudulent in your degree, there is a good chance you lack the human capital needed for the job, and you would not get it. If you do have the skills necessary, it will still come down to part-luck on whether YOU get it rather than someone else similar (because Signalling theory relies on the idea that you cannot accurately gauge human capital in an easy manner - it is very costly to do so). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Except that the EU regulations are the same throughout - so when 50% of the trade must meet one set of regulations it's better to have influence on those standards than not. 

The WTO has almost nothing to do with the nature of the regulations and important criteria unless someone is actually putting up protectionist tariffs. The 8% vote isn't the only issue here - it's the seat at the table to discuss it. The vote simply gives you some clout so people will listen.

TTIP would make the world $600 billion better off - you would be a fool to reject it. The faster we abolish most if not all the special protection cases the better. It's stalled because of the political deadlock in the US. 

Finally, don't make up stuff about what the EU can and cannot do. The reality is that it HAS suspended talks on Swiss participation in Erasmus+ and Horizon 2020 (worth 80 billion) because of Switzerland blocking the free flow of labour.

Study economics, rather than a UKIP leaflet, you will be more qualified to have this debate. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think you misunderstand - the EU has no interest in trade sanctions against the UK for leaving. The problem is that many goods imported into the EU must meet certain regulations - the UK currently has influence over what those criteria are - if we left we would lose that. We would lose any benefits accrued from the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership with the US (estimated benefit of $600 billion to trade). 

Switzerland abides by EU regulations but cannot shape them. Look at what happened recently with the Swiss trying to prevent the free flow of people into Switzerland from other EU countries - this is likely to result in both EU sanctions and Switzerland's expulsion from the fairly lucrative Erasmus programme.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Animal research is far, far more expensive that the alternatives (bar human trials). 

Those alternatives, where they exist, are used - particularly in cosmetics (the EU has banned animal use because those alternatives exist), but those alternatives don't answer all questions. If you want to understand the impact of a single gene, there is little else you can use other than genetically altered animals (for instance) - no computer program or cell culture will answer this question. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Might want to do more reading on Roselli's research:
http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/human_nature/2007/02/wool_and_graze.html
The research aimed to understand the biological roots of homosexuality, not cure it. Particularly read to the end:

"Differences among motives matter, even when they're subtle. PETA has made hay of a 2000 paper in which Stormshak posited that gay rams "may not be exposed to the same levels" of estrogen as straight rams. "If this is true," he wrote, then estrogen therapy "might alter their sexual behavior to the point of being more like" the behavior of straight rams. PETA thinks this study threatens to advance the eradication of homosexuality.

But look more closely. The paper's title is "Influence of castration and estrogen replacement on sexual behavior of female-oriented, male-oriented, and asexual rams." And that's what the study examines: All the rams, not just the gay ones, are castrated and given estrogen. The point isn't to make the gay rams straight; it's to "restore sexual behavior" in general. And the experiment fails. Stormshak concludes:

    Because there are no readily apparent phenotypic traits that characterize the male-oriented or asexual ram, these animals are frequently selected as flock sires and hence contribute to decreased fertility of ewes and economic loss to the sheep industry. Treatment of these types of rams with estrogens to enhance their sexual behavior or performance may not be practical." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The researchers can get paid to do new or old research, but think about those funding it. They have a limited pot of cash which they use to give out grants. It is not financially sensible to get researchers to keep doing the same experiment (remember all of this will be published, and researchers cannot get ahead in life doing repetitive research). No one wins by repeating work, everyone wins by doing new and innovative research. Your claims simply do not fit common sense logic.

Cosmetic testing is becoming a smaller and smaller area - it's already banned across the EU, and has wound down in many countries (China as a possible exception). You don't need to test a cosmetic on an animal to get it passed regulators in the US. So most companies avoid it. 

Why on earth are you using sources which are OVER 30 YEARS OLD. The funding environment, as well as the animal welfare act has changed in that time. 

However, many incidents of people claiming repetitive research is going on comes down to others not understanding the difference between two similar-looking, but fundamentally different, bits of research
