	<TEXT> There are two chirps your car will make.  One is the high pressure fuel pump, which will be a near constant chirp/squeak once warmed up and we call crickets.  The other is the AC compressor which will chirp every 10 seconds or so when the AC is on (or front window defrost is on, as the AC is running then as well).  Both are totally normal. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well my theory originally was to run the LWCP until I could afford a nice clutch/LWFW and tearing into the transmission.  However just recently a member started a survey thread about running both pulley and flywheel and there are plenty of folks who do without problem.  It's likely a combination of other mods like FI contributed to the problem, as well as being a holdover from other Subie engines (where it really was a bad thing to do).

And a Focus, Taurus and Corolla that were all driven by my ex-fiancee (that breakup was why the first Tundra went away as well...memories).

So yeah, I have a problem with buying vehicles heh.  I keep motorcycles the longest, till they're paid.  The GTO I owned the longest, not quite four years.  Then the first Tundra right about three. </TEXT>

I bought the highest all-around performing all seasons as tested by Tire Rack - Hankook ventus s1 noble2s.  Working great.  Better than the stock summers in the dry as well.  I may get dedicated snows out in the future but these will more than meet my needs this season.  Especially given my ability to telework. </TEXT>

Mod wise she had a roots supercharger (Magnacharger) with a two size down pulley, ported and polished throttle body, carbon fiber intake, gauge pod and taillights imported from Oz, full exhaust (JBA shorties and high flow cats, custom catback), built torque converter, spoiler delete, carbon fiber hood for a bit (because stocker was damaged by some jerk's hitch at work), 05+ rear conversion, and custom tuning by Magnaflow (by their chief engineer in their dyno cell).  The last time it was on the dyno with me it was over 480whp, but that was before the intake and TB work. Through the 4L60E it was just over 600bhp.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I figured the strut clearance thing would be an issue given the springs vice coilovers...I think most folks running that wheel are on coilovers.  Also I wasn't talking about the poke (how far the wheel sticks out) but stretch (how the tire doesn't go all the way to the edge of the rim).  I ran 245s on 8 inch wide rims on my GTO back in the day.

	<TEXT> Based on what I have read here, I'd say there is a strong possibility he likes you.  And also, since you used the "S" word...Introversion != Shy.

	<TEXT> They're all pretty much in the same place. Bluetooth is largely fully working; MMS is still being figured out; some have data issues on cellular (lose signal on reboot is fairly common)...For the average user none are really daily driver material yet.  For the power user they're all about the same.  I run CM12 myself but follow all the builds on XDA.  12/04 in my experience works better than 12/06 from a signal perspective but the camera i  12/06 seems to be better, as well as built-in Hotspot working in 12/06.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I went through the whole list.  I recognized 7.  Which means I didn't recognize 93.  I live in the US.  Thing is though, being bi doesn't define me - it's just one aspect of me.  It's not my career and my life doesn't revolve around it.  I also don't really listen to music, spend time on Broadway or in art galleries, etc.  It's cool that some magazine that nine times out of 10 has straight people on the cover thinks they're important to society at large though. </TEXT>
