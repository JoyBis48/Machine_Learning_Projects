	<TEXT> Ha ha. You might be right, but HRC already has a national constituency and she's trouncing these guys in the early polls. She WILL suck up the money if she runs, so it will be interesting to see if she's as moderate as her husband was or if she runs to the left. Primary voters are definitely more extreme in both parties, but I'd argue that this situation is more severe in the GOP.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The right GOP candidate in the general election is not the same GOP candidate who can win GOP primaries. One must be moderate, the other extreme (and borderline insane). 

If Jeb Bush can suck up enough of the money early on, he could just say 'screw it' and run towards the middle right away. See what happens. I don't see them beating HRC with that far-right platform.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It does look pretty nasty. Being publicly traded, it is subject to some SEC regulation, and so they won't necessarily get away with the Wild West antics we've seen in the cryptosphere. But that also means they need to be more careful. There are ways to pump that are legal, but plenty of penny stocks have had government problems for playing fast and loose.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The volatility issue is overblown. With BitPay or Coinbase, etc., one can cash out every day into fiat. Better yet, as you've indicated, there are other cryptos and services that allow someone to hedge the price without going back into actual fiat. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Good post and I agree with you, except that it's rather disappointing. If I read something called "Why you should support the Olympics baseball bid", then I want a link to a petition or I want you to tell me HOW I can help this cause. I agree with you I'd like it to happen. But in your last paragraph, the best you can suggest seems to be "Let's all hope"... Great. I'm hoping. There isn't anything more we can do? Write somebody a letter? Tweet it? Etc. I want a clear call to action if you're asking for support. Tell me who to contact.  </TEXT>
