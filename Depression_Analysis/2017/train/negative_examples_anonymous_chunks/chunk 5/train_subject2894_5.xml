	<TEXT> Oh good thing you've spotted a Wikipedia page about insects and plants we **literally have all over the country.**


*Thank god these little bugs aren't confined to a small island that has upcoming plans to be bombed on. That'd be stupid now wouldn't it? :) Wouldn't want these species to die out in one go now would we?*

	<TEXT> With all this debate about Windows 10, it'd be wise to sit back and see what happens. Personally I think it's not going to have any privacy whatsoever due to the NSA, but we'll see. Reserve by all means, but I'll be upgrading (or not) if I know it's 'safe'.

If it has any privacy threat whatsoever, it can gtfo. </TEXT>

Let's blow up an island instead of advancing biological understanding of biodiverse islands. 'murica. I'm so glad to be from the UK. </TEXT>
