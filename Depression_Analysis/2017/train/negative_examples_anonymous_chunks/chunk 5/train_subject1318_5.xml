	<TEXT> That book... just... I don't even know what to say about that one scene in the cave. You know the one. Only King could write that and not have Chris Hansen kick in his door with the Dateline crew. It's weird how he managed to turn that into a POSITIVE thing - I think that is what makes it one of the most horrifying books of all time. It can make the reader see something positive about something so fucked up no matter how uncomfortable you feel.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is excellent. I spent most of my undergrad in neurophysiology but was always somewhat interested in the behavioral side. My SO, however, is a therapist who works at one of our cities high schools. I'll have to show her this; it could certainly be good for her to check out. Hell, if nothing else maybe it'll get her to come to a game night and try it herself!

Either way - best of luck and I sincerely am bummed that I am on the wrong coast to attend. If you have someone film we'd love to see the footage! </TEXT>

The boyfriend could have entered through her fire escape, killed her, gone home and hung up. That would explain why the maid heard silence while the phone was connected.")

	<TEXT> Oh for certain. And that's a great point - its the classic "ninja" sword I was referring to; I could have spoken more clearly. I think that the sword in Japan has an incredible history and is an amazing feat of engineering (in its simple elegance rather than complexity). I just see the henain period and on as producing some of histories most incredible swords. The change in sword geometry calls for a change in cutting technique. As an iaido student I know how to cut as taught by my school and its lineage, that's an incredibly narrow part of the picture.

By all means go for what makes you happy and with what resonates with you - I'm just some dude on the internet :-)
