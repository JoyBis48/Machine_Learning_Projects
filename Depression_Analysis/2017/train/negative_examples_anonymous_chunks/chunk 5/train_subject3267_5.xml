	<TEXT> In the world of words, atheism is often, maybe always, the flip-side of theism. But what were we when we were born?  Beliefs and belief systems shouldn't be reduced to categories and concepts. Yes it makes them easier to argue and discuss, but also obscures their real nature, thereby making discussion about them less simple, and tends to make it about words. The discussion can be fun and can continue for its own sake, but we aren't really talking about the real nature of belief.  

We should take it to another level and incorporate this in the discussion, instead of remaining in the world of abstractions.  </TEXT>

We would get more value from Cooper because there would be so much offensive synergy with Carr that we wouldn't get with Williams. </TEXT>

Charles Baudelaire - Elevation

Above the lakes, above the vales,
The mountains and the woods, the clouds, the seas,
Beyond the sun, beyond the ether,
Beyond the confines of the starry spheres,
My soul, you move with ease, 
And like a strong swimmer in rapture in the wave 
You wing your way blithely through boundless space 
With virile joy unspeakable.
Fly far, far away from this baneful miasma 
And purify yourself in the celestial air, 
Drink the ethereal fire of those limpid regions 
As you would the purest of heavenly nectars.
Beyond the vast sorrows and all the vexations
That weigh upon our lives and obscure our vision,
Happy is he who can with his vigorous wing
Soar up towards those fields luminous and serene,
He whose thoughts, like skylarks,
Toward the morning sky take flight
 Who hovers over life and understands with ease
The language of flowers and silent things! </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  because I believe the Bible is inspired by God

Seems to be circular reasoning.  That you are a Christian because you believe, and vice versa.

What is the nature of God?  Does it/he have a nature or is it more of a concept?  If he has a nature and character, is it that described in the Bible?  If so, why is his love not really anything like that described?  That is, love should be immediate and demonstrable, not mysterious and conditional, especially the love of the great Father, God. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> ....Unless you are a crack baby born to a prostitute and chained in a basement for decades.  

"God" isn't shorthand for "the cause", or the "unexplainable other" - at least as he describes himself in the Bible.  You'll notice that most people find sunsets beautiful, when they see them.  For another person to come along and state that that person is really talking about God, whether they know it or not, is quite a leap.  Certainly God wouldn't count this as a declaration of faith, and grant him salvation and eternal life, and why not?

Etc.

We each need to ask ourselves who/what/where is God *for me*.  Not what does CS Lewis or Pascal or Aquinas or Dawkins say, but *what do I say*.  There are arguments for God, but they aren't anything close to personal manifestations of God.  We don't, and shouldn't, need a book or a text or a tradition or an institution to bring us to God.  In fact, this common and strong tendency for conflation might be a clue as to whether he is there or not.  The medium isn't the message.  Nor is faith itself to be confused with faith *in something*.  Faith in what?  Faith itself?  The unknown?

For starters, let's look at his claims in the Bible of who he is:  among these, a loving father.  If I loved my kids as he appears to love me, my kids would A. Not know me (but they must have faith, because that's how I set up the rules, just because) B. Be estranged from me (but I love them mysteriously, at a distance, in ways they can't comprehend, mostly because they sin so much, and because I'm so much *greater* than them, and beyond their comprehension)  I won't try to make myself known, or make them experience my love in a way they can't deny, *even though I'm their father*, and this would be easy, if not automatic, for me. C. Probably develop and antipathy toward me.  And this is a real, earthly father, someone they can see and talk to directly! </TEXT>

Ive been lately struggling with this same stuff. Hiked up to Angels Landing in Zion National Park a couple weeks ago. Was surrounded by dozens of college kids on spring break, and one large church group of college kids. They had absolutely zero regard for their fellow hiker and zero appreciation of the beauty around them. Extremely annoying and obnoxious. To me there seemed such a chasm betwen the nature I was in and the nature of these people around me.  Was trying to find compassion, without condescension or arrogance. Couldnt find compassion at all. Or even understanding.  </TEXT>

what i was getting at is that trying to get people to do things because it "isn't cool" is actually counter productive.  it encourages herd mentality, people behaving like frat boys (as the police do).  the right thing to do is often *not* what is hip. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> i dont like scientology either. but you are encouraging a herd mentality and not trusting people to think for themselves. you are saying that making something cool or shameful is a good way to achieve a desired behavior. 

this is in fact something that promotes cult behavior in the first place: people doing something for acceptance, because it is cool, or to avoid shaming or ridicule. people need to think rationally for themselves, whether the herd is with them or not. rational, sensible, substantive arguments should be made in an environment that welcomes it. 

otherwise, you are just promoting a "good cult" to take the place of a "bad cult": "you aren't "hip" because you dont believe X Y and Z like the we do". THIS is what the world doesnt need.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So you think it is obvious that Andy Goldworthy's art is just "nature stuff" and "autumn leaves", and nothing more.  You are caricaturing my post, and reducing it (I actually didn't say anything specifically about what makes it Taoist) to "the obvious".  Your problem with people stating the obvious is actually a problem you have with yourself repackaging and reducing something you think you see to be "the obvious".  *There are innumerable aspects of depth and variation and complexity to Goldsworthy's art.  This goes without saying.  This is pointing out the truly obvious - which you are either denying or are ignorant of.*

You imply that I'm missing how Taoism applies to our daily lives.  Actually, I'm expanding our realization of how Taoism applies to our daily lives.  Further, I can't cover everything in just one post.  I'll get to the rest of our daily lives eventually.

Your own comments argue against themselves and waste peoples' time. </TEXT>

the banner to this subreddit needs to state that we all know the tao that is spoken is not the true tao, but we are going to speak anyway - just as lao tzu and chuang tzu did....  that that is the starting point.  otherwise you get these feedback loops like we are in now, when commenters like you keep repeating this mantra.  i wonder what your point is and why you even bother with this subreddit. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> i dont disagree much at all with that.  only, to me, some things are more taoist and others less taoist- but only in our perception/conception of them. for instance, some books are very taoist, some explicitly so. other books are very non/un-taoist- books about scientology, for instance. though they think they are different and have a certain view, they actually cant help but adhere to the taoist principles, as you say. i suppose, then, that i mean the un taoist stuff wrongly views itself a certain way, when it cant help but be taoist. the disharmony comes only in this misconception and not in the actuality of the thing itself. this is why taoism is so refreshing: people find it was there along along. so i think a lot of art and literature is neutral on the matter, but goldsworthy's work struck me to be especially expressing ghe yin yang in a unique way. also growth, time, change, flow. one could potentially draw parallels to the watercourse way and the uncarved block, but id be careful there. 

if that makes sense. im in a hurry... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> i have had the same thing with my ENFP/J girlfriend. i was using he word "autonomy" a lot, to no avail. she didnt want to give me space or time. was somewhat possessive and controlling. but like you, i would feel very drained at times and unable to recharge. i dont understand why some people cant handle the autonomy of another. fear of this or that i suppose.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> All the definitions (that I've come across) of co-dependency seem overly complex and/or overly vague.  Can anyone give me, or point me to, a concise and clear and thorough definition of co-dependency?  Thanks! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> i would first read alan watts "tao - the watercourse way". he is a gifted writer, explains taoism extremely well. there is a free version on scribd. it is the best intro book by far, in my opinion. 

also listen to his "philosophy of taoism" lectures on youtube.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> im still on vacation and will get to these when finished.  i generally think this sort of scientific and apparently thorough approach doesnt get SK and what he said on a very basic level. but i hope to take a closer look later.  

in short: the immediate is unmediated. and what is on the other side of the chasm (the one some say they leap across) is absolutely unknown, if the chasm even exists.... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> he runs circles arounds us all.  i read the first 3 of OP's objections/replies and found them to be thoroughly lacking, not convincing in the least. the first was a total non sequitur. in fact, they convince/remind me of the strength, depth, and profundity of SK more than anything.  </TEXT>
