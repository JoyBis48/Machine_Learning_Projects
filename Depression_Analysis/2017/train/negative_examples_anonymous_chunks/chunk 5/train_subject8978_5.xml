	<TEXT> "The essential act of war is destruction, not necessarily of human lives, but of the products of human labour. War is a way of shattering to pieces, or pouring into the stratosphere, or sinking in the depths of the sea, materials which might otherwise be used to make the masses too comfortable, and hence, in the long run, too intelligent. Even when weapons of war are not actually destroyed, their manufacture is still a convenient way of expending labour power without producing anything that can be consumed. A Floating Fortress, for example, has locked up in it the labour that would build several hundred cargo-ships. Ultimately it is scrapped as obsolete, never having brought any material benefit to anybody, and with further enormous labours another Floating Fortress is built. In principle the war effort is always so planned as to eat up any surplus that might exist after meeting the bare needs of the population. In practice the needs of the population are always underestimated, with the result that there is a chronic shortage of half the necessities of life; but this is looked on as an advantage. It is deliberate policy to keep even the favoured groups somewhere near the brink of hardship, because a general state of scarcity increases the importance of small privileges and thus magnifies the distinction between one group and another." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Have to agree. After Dead Man, which I thought was a masterpiece, I was really hoping Ghost Dog would be better, and it left me feeling a little cold. I liked it, but didn't think it was up to Jarmusch's standards. And you're right, Limits of Control was basically unwatchable.

That way, they're connected and you get the "drift" thing, but then there's also a logical reason, some redundancy, they need both pilots to agree to do a certain action.

From 1970 through 2008, the US marriage rate has declined from 76.5 to 37.4 marriages per 1,000 unmarried women  see the chart below:

44 Officers Are Charged After Ohio Sting Operation

In what may be the largest and widest ranging police corruption investigation in the country in recent years, 44 officers from five law-enforcement agencies were charged today with taking money to protect cocaine trafficking operations in Cleveland and northern Ohio, Federal authorities said.

	<TEXT> Again, I think you're trying to have it both ways. The law is stupid and unjust, and the prosecution was politically motivated....but really there's no problem because it was all legal. It's this vacillation I object to. Again, that it was in keeping with the law doesn't work because it was selective prosecution, re: the other seed distributors. I think this was without any doubt a strictly political maneuver and neither justice nor the law was served. 

And sorry, not be a dick, but you are being naive about the power structure behind the war on drugs. There are very, very powerful interests at work that have absolutely no interest in seeing marijuana decriminalized here and the economic repercussions would be so horrendous, no government could actually enact it up here. Being defeatist is acceptance of defeat without struggle. That's not what I'm advocating, the struggle should go on, but if you're not aware of just how powerful the anti-drug lobby is in the U.S. you're kidding yourself. I have to agree with David Simon, the U.S. drug war is a holocaust in slow-motion and if they're willing to live with that, what makes you think Canada is going to change their mind? We follow their lead because we have to.

	<TEXT> Wait a minute, you can't have it both ways. Are you trying to claim that it was both politically motivated AND the case was pursued in the interests of justice? That's absurd. The arrest and conviction of Emery has, of course, done absolutely nothing to halt the marijuana or marijuana seed trade in the U.S., it was strictly done for political purposes and you clearly know that. If not, why didn't the DEA go after the Vancouver Seed Bank or Kind Seed or Vancouver Island Seed Company or Liberty Seeds? Well, when they get big enough, they will because it's politically motivated. Some prosecutor will be looking for a feather in their cap.

But back to my original point, you originally claimed that "Canada is a sovereign nation, the US can't disallow us from doing anything." But that's kind of naive, don't you think? The U.S. drug apparatus, from money laundering banks like HSBC to the police to the lawyers to the judges to the private prisons all have way too much at stake and will not allow Canada to mess that up. Which is why we HAVEN'T decriminalized marijuana in the last thirty years. We keep talking about it, but until the U.S. changes its mind, which it might eventually, we will follow the American lead. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Wow. Never seen someone actually try to claim the Marc Emery case wasn't politically motivated. Not even the DEA Administrator who prosecuted the case:

"Today's DEA arrest of Marc Scott Emery, publisher of Cannabis Culture Magazine, and the founder of a marijuana legalization group -- is a significant blow not only to the marijuana trafficking trade in the U.S. and Canada, **but also to the marijuana legalization movement**."

Also, you're misunderstanding the case. He wasn't charged with any crimes in the U.S. all the alleged crimes occurred in Canada and police here never charged him with anything. This is about as clear a case as you can get of the U.S. drug policy trumping Canadian laws, whether you want to admit it or not.

	<TEXT> I see what you're saying but pretty much the same thing can be said about lots of technology that reaches the consumer stage. It's a commercial application of an industrial technology that, in order to have mass appeal, specializes and reduces the capabilities of that original design. The technology in an iPad is actually pretty old. We've had a device that can be programmed to carry out a set of operations with a CPU and memory to run applications for a long time. But the innovation of the application of that technology counts for something. You could say the same thing about the iMac and compare it to a CRAY or whatever, you know what I mean. But the fact that 3-D printers are "crappy" cnc mills that use "shitty" mitres that only cut plastic is actually really important and definitely could have a serious impact on the way we produce goods. 3-D printers are "cheap" cnc mills that use "cheap" miters that use one of the most common and versatile substances on the market. That's very handy and, I hope, going to be cool! They'll constantly work to reduce the waste and improve it, but I think it looks very promising. I'm going to make my driverless Google car look like the Batmobile or something. Hopefully I can just download the plans!
