	<TEXT> I made it a point of not turning down interviews I got from attending on campus recruiting events close to graduation.  There were many booths for "Financial Advisers" that were open to all majors. Being open to all majors is a red flag on its own but I did research into what they actually did.  Some houses are more legit than others, but most get you to resell life insurance to family and friends.  As soon as they started asking me about my network of fam and friends I politely excused myself and walked out. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Barnes   Noble. I don't buy anything there but I like sitting in their chairs and reading magazines.  If only there were a place similar to B N that I could visit and perhaps borrow some books or magazines, take them home for a bit, or read them there, then return them at my convenience.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's a tough call because you're making a duck face in both pictures. 

In the second photo, the larger zoom makes it harder to see your duck face but it also reveals the large urine stain on your mattress. 

It's a really hard decision. Personally, I'd go with #2, as the urine stain is less embarrassing than the closeup duck face. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have some things I do that help me maintain.
1. NEVER eat in front of TV. This robs you of the sense of satisfaction you get from food as your senses are being overwhelmed by light and sound.
2. Learn to recognize when your body is not hungry. 
3. Be aware of your sugar consumption. Read food labels of things you eat and notice the addition of sugars. Taper off of sugar. It's basically poison. </TEXT>
