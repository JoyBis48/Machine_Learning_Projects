This statement makes no sense. "I did not have an awful home life, but was emotionally and physically abused" 

You understand why these statements are contradictory right?

Also, 

1. Where did you stay in Cali? 

2. How old are you now? 

3. How did you get the money to get there?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well I explained in my first comment. But I can explain again. 

A daughter will watch her mother and how her mother is treated by guys and how she deals with the situation. She will watch how her mother, and in this case, how her mother deals with her brother and then she treats situations with men similarly. So let's say she doesn't call the police and just doesn't want her brother to get into trouble because of this- even though it is very serious stuff. If she has a child- that type of behavior/attitude will be passed down her child and so forth. It's learned behavior. You think it's normal because that's what you've seen from your parent(s) your whole life so it becomes your norm. 

At some point, you have to break the trend. 

But she deleted her account so I'm guessing it was fake. lol </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hijacking top comment. 

I just found this post. You need to call the police and file a report on your brother. This will only continue to get worse for you if you do not. It will become a cycle. Where things may get better then get worse until it blows over, then get better, get worse...etc 

You may not be able to see this now. But accepting his behavior without calling th e police or enforcing consequences for his actions/words will affect your relationship with men for the rest of your life. 

It's important to do what you can to get away from him, not just for your sake but like the comment here, to help other people and other women in his life in the future.

" I mean, I dont want to get him to get in that big of trouble. "  He needs to get in big trouble. I know he's family but this behavior cannot be encouraged. 


Counselor here.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Dear Falling Skies,


I have been a fan of your show since the first season. I have been most disappointed with this season and yet I will continue to watch the show because now I am unfortunately invested in it.
A couple things. I get that the alien's name is Cochise, but when Tom Mason says it it sounds like goat cheese or coat cheese. As a result it has become increasingly annoying to me that every time Tom Mason talks about goat cheese or to goat cheese he says his name. I saw in last weeks episode they said "goat cheese" about 15-20 times in the show. It's annoying and is really ruining the experience with the show.


Secondly, please kill the Lexi storyline it's awful. This whole season has been so fragmented like you had an idea then abandoned it and changed your mind. It's been strange. Also Moon Bloodgood's character has been written has increasingly annoying. She is a good actress don't waste her talent on such trivial lines that make her sound so whiney. Please.


Lastly, stop saying goat cheese's name so much. Please. It's not necessary. I know who he is! Or perhaps you wouldn't have had to do that if you didn't make the alien's from each race all look like each other. Humans all look different. Logically from an evolutionary standpoint it would make sense that other alien races would not all look identical. Some wouldn't even be the same height. This is a common theme in film and television with aliens and sadly you have not learned from their mistakes on this issue.


If you have not listened to anything I have suggested please listen to only this: Stop saying "goat cheese" so much. Seriously quit. It ruined last week's episode. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well. I DCed once. I am in the middle of inking and then I see the ink come out of the gun but it doesn't render on the ground. Then I got DCed. I don't know why I would DC though, my internet is fine. 

It's just frustrating, I want to a play a full game without someone quitting, or randomly being DCed. 

You think they will ever do a free for all? 1v1v1v1v1v1v1v1?? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, why don't they just make it so it doesn't have to be random every time? lol That way I could play with my friend. And not be against him. 

Okay. I give up. I love this game. But that is the 5th time in 9 games someone has DCed. I also got DCed twice, and I've checked my ISP, I have very fast internet and the only thing I'm using it for is this game.  </TEXT>

Out of curiosity, this is unrelated, do you think we'll get more than two game options? Or they will put turf wars in ranked too? Or allow you to play with friends in ranked? </TEXT>
