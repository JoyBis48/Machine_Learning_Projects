	<TEXT> Conrad was an unbelievably good person. Not only did he raise awareness of these atrocities, he also used satire to show up the do-gooders of his time who said they cared about Leopold's abuses in the Congo even though most of these people didn't consider the Africans fully human. 

Another massive hero in bringing these killings to light was [E.D. Morel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._D._Morel) who was a shipping agent in Liverpool who figured out that something was wrong from inconsistencies in shipping manifests. He did some detective work and uncovered the mass killings. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A great place to learn about his life and the terrible treatment he received is: [johnallegro.org](http://www.johnallegro.org/)

Allegro's books themselves first of all because they are mindblowing. Here's a PDF of his: [Sacred Mushroom and the Cross](http://gen.lib.rus.ec/book/index.php?md5=71B938446A8AF6363AF73D19876AFE40)
Also the Dead Sea Scrolls is an excellent read. His conclusions about Christianity are radical and highly controversial but backed up by his philological mastery. He believes that Christianity formed out of a cult that used hallucinogens, in particular the fly agaric mushroom. He makes a wild case for this with the original language of the Gospels.

Allegro was an absolute genius who was destroyed by some very powerful people owing to his conclusions about early Christianity formed while working on the Dead Sea scrolls. He was a MAJOR scholar of ancient religion and language who was demonized and broken. Everyone on this sub should know about his story, this is the archetype of a conspiracy. I'll definitely listen to this. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I grew up in DC and was around a lot of people at the top of the food chain earlier in life. They are usually really smart but incredibly unquestioning. It's a weird combination that you'll find is very prevalent at Ivy League schools. There's an almost cult like aspect to their failure to ever question whatever echo chamber they happen to be in. In my opinion, the smartest people don't tend to get a sniff at the higher levels of power unless they have a degree of sociopathy about them. People with a high emotional IQ don't get anywhere near those jobs. They don't usually get into Harvard or Yale. Really brilliant people from STEM backgrounds might climb the ladder within a think tank or NASA or some research facility but they'll hit the wall at a certain point when politics comes into play especially regarding getting funded. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've come to the conclusion that it's way more important to vote in local elections. Town council seats can be decided by dozens of votes and have a massive effect on how local communities are able to live. We have no say with the big stuff unless we organize at street level. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Shouldn't there be a distinction between skeptic and debunker? I'm paranoid by nature and thus skeptical of everything but most of all debunkers. Popular Mechanics, I'm looking at you. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Fair enough, but I think those misdeeds do shed some light on the culture these people grew up in which is extremely elitist. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm reading a good book on him now by Gary Lachman. I don't think Crowley was evil but I do think he was more damaged than the average mystic and I don't trust him. He's fascinating, but at the same time he makes me suspicious of his motives. 
And while it may well be nonsense, is the Bush stuff really so crazy? I mean she looks JUST like him. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Exactly. War is about the people who already have more money than they know what to do with. They want toys. Instead of toy soldiers and model planes and tanks, they get to use the real thing. Just listen to how flushed and excited they get when they go on their stupid jaunts where the general shows off the latest gadgets. People who want to enter the highest levels of power all get addicted to the feeling of being able to use real people as playthings. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks. Interesting article. I'm still blown away by the interaction between American companies and Germany after the war started in Europe. Chemicals and pharmaceuticals, banking, information management systems, everything. We helped them a great deal well into the war. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> While the Independent is right that the Rothschilds didn't make a killing on the stock market in the hours after Waterloo, they massively benefited from the economic downturn that followed it due to the winding down of the wartime economy. They were very wealthy before Waterloo and stratospherically wealthy after. This is similar to the way people like the Rockefellers benefitted from the stock market crash in 1929 by being the only ones with capital who could buy up basically sound companies that were faltering because of temporary liquidity problems. Capitalism makes these excesses inevitable and always leads to economic/political elites. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I largely agree with you though think it might just be possible. It only matters in so far as it shows the weird kind of synchronicities that happen when looking at elites. I'd be more freaked out if the Bush's had a genetic connection to Ayn Rand. </TEXT>
