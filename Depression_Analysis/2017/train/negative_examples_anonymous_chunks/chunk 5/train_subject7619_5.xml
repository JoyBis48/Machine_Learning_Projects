	<TEXT>  audiences want some levity in their superheroes

The ones who religiously watch Marvel movies do. Nolan's trilogy was hugely popular and did ridiculous box office numbers, and although opinions vary, Man of Steel did very well for itself too.

It's okay if Marvel and DC have different approaches; they both have their audience.

I would also expect that some of their movies, like The Flash, will be a little lighter in tone. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You might be right about Suicide Squad; it has been bringing out a lot of mixed opinions. From what I've seen online, a lot of people have already made up their minds to hate it. 

That's neither here nor there, though. WB isn't counting on Suicide Squad to break box office records; that's what Batman/Superman is for, and *that's* the movie that opens the flood gates for Justice League, Cyborg, The Flash, Wonder Woman, Aquaman, etc.

Suicide Squad can flop all day. It won't be the first or last WB movie to do so. </TEXT>

I was actually thinking of going there because there's not even a slight reference to Jesus or anything Christian in the Grinch book or the movies, but the timing wouldn't make sense.

Horton Hears a Who! takes place from May 15th-16th and Christmas in Whoville is definitely in the winter. Assuming their holiday would be on the anniversary of their contact with the outside world, it should be May 16th, late spring. </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2015-05-28 16:00:46 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> In The Grinch Who Stole Christmas, the eponymous character is motivated to end Christmas because he cannot bear the noise made by the Whos in Whoville. Their traditions involve making an incredible amount of noise.

In Horton Hear a Who, we learn that the Whos are tiny people-like creatures living on a dust speck which Horton takes upon himself to protect. When he almost fails and the Whos are threatened with having their whole world boiled in Beezlenut oil, Horton encourages them all to make noise so that they sour kangaroo can hear them and confirm their existence.

Whos associate collective loud noise making with their triumph and survival in their darkest hour.

**EDIT**: This theory is based on the two books referenced and not the four movies (two each) based on the books. </TEXT>

So you're saying liberals don't want "restriction" and conservatives don't want "freedom?"

That doesn't sound right. And what do you mean by "restriction?"

___wing refers to your preferred level of government involvement. Right is a lot, left is none.

I'm pretty sure it's the opposite. Right-wingers are the ones always advocating for less government while lefties seem to generally believe in more government programs, or at least better-funded ones. </TEXT>

Your comment: "Hahha, the poor dummy is holding the bow wr-oh. Well. Shit."

Post title: "Thats not how you hold your b...oh!"

****ALMOST*** verbatim, as in ***NOT*** verbatim, but similar. It's called "hyperbole." You'll find it's fairly common on the internet. You're not being attacked, so lower the defenses. You're not a bad guy, a stupid guy, or whatever else you managed to infer offense from.

2) People have similar thoughts....inconceivable!

Yeah... which is exactly what I pointed out. Brilliant.

3) Also...man, this post is five days old. Your backlog of reddit comment detective work must be growing by the day. 

I can't even figure out what you're trying to say. Yes, this post is five days old. It's the one your comment reminded me of. What "backlog of Reddit comment detective work" of mine is "growing by the day?" What does that even mean?

	<TEXT> I'm not understanding your logic.

If climate change is real, largely man-made, and reversible, the opposition funding climate change denial is profit motivated because whatever they're selling--fossil fuels, etc.--is the leading cause of the problem.

The other side--solar panel producers, the makers of windmills, etc.--have a profit motive, which is to sell things that reduce carbon emissions and thereby reduce pollution.

I get *their* motivations, but what sensible person prefers we continue to burn fossil fuels, produce carbon emissions, and continue to pollute at reckless levels? What's the downside to reducing pollution? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> I recently posted an explanation of Jay Garrick. Due to requests, here's one for Wally West   Bart Allen. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-05-20 14:54:58 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I was recently asked to do a Wally West   Bart Allen one, so here that is for anyone curious:

Sure, and The Flash extended family goes even beyond that, but Wally   Bart should be easy enough.

Wally West goes way back to 1959. There was a very powerful trend in DC Comics to give their marque superheroes a child sidekick, and The Flash was no exception, so [Wally West was introduced as "Kid Flash."](http://i.imgur.com/OowRBRA.jpg) 

Barry was dating Iris West at the time and Wally was her nephew. As if the costume isn't unoriginal enough, he got his powers because the exact same accident that gave Barry his powers happened to Wally.

Barry sacrificed himself in the Crisis on Infinite Earths in 1986. Wally gave up the Kid Flash moniker and replaced The Flash, but this was also a way for the editorial staff to nerf the character a bit, as he had become OP as fuck over the years. He could no longer go faster-than-light, but rather the speed of sound and sometimes a bit beyond, much like our CW Barry. 

Wally eventually came across Reverse-Flash (Eobard Thawne) and had to up his game, so OPAF Flash returned because he had to match Eobard's speed. Sometime during the 90s, the concept of "Speed Force" was introduced by Mark Waid, which became the go-to explanation of expanded powers and general fuckery that couldn't otherwise be made sense of. With the variety set of new powers, Speed Force as a way of explaining anything, and the ability to go faster-than-light, it has been argued by some, quite logically, that The Flash is actually more powerful and more OP than Superman.

As of the Flashpoint/New 52 event, Barry Allen is the only Flash to have ever existed in mainstream continuity, but they have shown Wally West in the future. He's now biracial and [sports a new costume.](http://i.imgur.com/WlY1dv4.jpg)

Bart Allen, in pre-Flashpoint 52 continuity, would be the fourth to become The Flash after Jay Garrick, Barry Allen, and Wally West. [He debuted as Impulse in 1994](http://i.imgur.com/DRUfBsS.jpg) and later became Kid Flash. He's a descendant of Barry Allen and Iris West, but is also a Thawne. Just like Wally West was a sidekick "Kid Flash" to Barry Allen, Bart Allen was a sidekick to Wally West.

Bart Allen even got to be the fourth Flash in his own series ever-so-briefly but was [killed off](http://i.imgur.com/M2OT1Io.png) in 2006 only to be brought back as [Kid Flash in 2009](http://i.imgur.com/mtYf3pJ.jpg) thanks to an event called Final Crisis. 

After the continuity reshuffle of Flashpoint and the New 52, he was a time-displaced [Kid Flash](http://i.imgur.com/VwWk678.jpg) with the Teen Titans with some serious amnesia problems.

	<TEXT> [Jay Garrick was the original Flash.](http://i.imgur.com/M2VD5ug.jpg) He was [cancelled in 1951](http://i.imgur.com/jyzFIvH.jpg) as superhero comics were waning. 

[Barry Allen was a reboot in 1956](http://i.imgur.com/xOzQpVu.jpg), an attempt to revive a classic character. [Jay Garrick existed to Barry Allen as a comic book character.](http://i.imgur.com/9er8eTm.jpg) Eventually, DC thought it would be cool to have the two meet, so to explain this, they were both [The Flash of two different worlds.](http://i.imgur.com/E3JsTF0.jpg) 

Flash forward to 1976, Jay Garrick and other old-timey comic book characters were brought back in the parallel world's answer to the Justice League: [The Justice Society.](http://i.imgur.com/LIYkZWa.jpg)

In 1985, DC Comics had one of the biggest events in comic book history called ***CRISIS*** on Infinite Earths. You'll recall The Flash [disappearing in a ***CRISIS***](http://i.imgur.com/Nii95UB.jpg) in Eobard's newspaper from the future. This event merged all the parallel worlds of DC Comics into one, so Jay Garrick was retconned as having [always existed in the same world as Barry Allen and was in fact his predecessor, the original Flash.](http://i.imgur.com/uQ8Bkbz.jpg)

After an event called Flashpoint where [The Flash goes back in time to save his mother from getting murdered by The Reverse Flash](http://i.imgur.com/kBFQbl8.jpg)  (sound familiar?), DC Comics had itself another reboot establishing the New 52, which, among other things, [merged some of their imprints like Vertigo, WildStorm, Milestone, etc., into mainstream continuity](http://i.imgur.com/2x35VNA.jpg) and just generally messed around with continuity with mixed results. 

Many of DC's "legacy characters" are now featured in "Earth 2," again establishing multiple worlds. [Jay Garrick is The Flash of Earth 2](http://i.imgur.com/4rmSaSu.jpg), just like he was way back in the 60s.

If anyone has anything to add/clarify/correct, please weigh-in. I know I left a lot out, but my goal was an abridged breakdown of the essentials for the uninformed, not a comprehensive guide. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [SPOILER] Time Travel Paradoxes </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-05-20 04:16:42 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> The strange thing with all this time travel is the paradoxes it necessarily creates. Eddie killed himself, so Eobard was never born, but he only disappears from existence at the time when Eddie killed himself. If he was never born, he never would have existed at all, meaning he never could have gone back in time to kill Barry's mom, blow up the particle accelerator, etc., and no one would have any memory of him because he'd have never existed.

But what's really fucky for me is that Eobard was from a different timeline than Eddie, so Eddie's sacrifice should have only affected *his* future. As soon as Eobard went back in time and killed Barry's mother, he created a new timeline--one that he was stuck in. I would assume the Eddie of *his* timeline, the one he traveled back in time from, is alive and well.

Remember, they have 100% established that going back in time creates a new timeline. Eobard confirmed that when he commented on Cisco's ability to remember what happened to him in another timeline. 

So... what if Eddie didn't kill Eobard; he just wanted them to believe he had. We know the wormhole came back, but we don't know what triggered it. Perhaps Eobard never needed the time machine; after all, he didn't have one when he traveled back to kill Barry. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Why wouldn't Batman master magic? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-05-18 20:16:53 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I sometimes read comments or entire threads dedicated to the fact that Batman not only has Tony Stark style money and resources but has literally been shown to have cybernetic armor suits on par or superior to any Iron Man suit, so why in the hell does he go without? That's usually met with a variety of answers trying to explain something that really doesn't make much sense, but what about magic?

It is an established fact that the DC Universe--possibly all of them--has magic. Unlike the armor, you can't say "it's not his style" because his style has consistently been to master the crap out of everything, know everything, be the best there is at everything. 

Not only would magic be hugely useful in a number of practical ways, but it would also help him with threats like Superman who are vulnerable to magic (we're talking about a guy who keeps Kyptonite in his utility belt). If the JLA encountered a magical threat, they'd have an ace up their sleeve because Bruce studied the dark arts. 

Anybody got an answer for this? </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> There seems to be a sort of conflation of ideas in that they either reflect your personality/skills and come about accordingly, as evidenced by The Cutie Mark Crusaders trying to "earn" theirs. 

They also seem to suggest that they tell you your destiny, as evidenced by that song/episode "What My Cutie Mark is Telling Me" where the Mane Six had theirs swapped.

What I don't get is names. Rainbow Dash, for example, had the words Rainbow and Dash in her name presumably since birth and she grows up to be the one who can pull off a sonic rainboom or whatever? The name "Dash" connotes speed. You could easily write off the rainbow part if the parents didn't name her until she was born and they noticed the color scheme, but unless they were prescient, they couldn't have known her destiny. 

The same is true of Fluttershy. Her name rhymes with her cutie mark--a butterfly--and she's shy. These are details her parents couldn't have possibly known about her when she was born.

I considered that maybe parents don't name their kids until these facts are established, but not only do the Cutie Mark Crusaders have names, but the infant children of the baker parents have names. 

So what's the deal? Are the parents blessed with some sort of precognition when it comes to naming their offspring? How do foals coincidentally end up with names that represent them every bit as well as their eventual cutie marks do? </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> My main question concerns Germany and Japan. Did Japan actually treat their POWs the worst? 

[From Wikipedia:](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_war_crimes#Crimes)

According to the findings of the Tokyo Tribunal, the death rate among POWs from Asian countries, held by Japan was 27.1%.[40] The death rate of Chinese POWs was much higher becauseunder a directive ratified on August 5, 1937 by Emperor Hirohitothe constraints of international law on treatment of those prisoners was removed.[41] Only 56 Chinese POWs were released after the surrender of Japan.[42] After March 20, 1943, the Japanese Navy was under orders to execute all prisoners taken at sea.[43] Around 1,536 U.S. civilians were killed or otherwise died of abuse and mistreatment in Japanese internment camps in the Far East; by comparison, 883 U.S. civilians died in German internment camps in Europe.[44] </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm a little confused after reading [Douglas Haigs final dispatch](http://www.firstworldwar.com/source/haiglastdespatch.htm) and [David Lloyd Georges comments on the battle of the Somme.](http://www.gwpda.org/1916/llgsomme.html)

I'm just having trouble marrying [Erich von Falkenhayns justification of the Verdun Offensive](http://www.firstworldwar.com/source/verdun_falkenhayn.htm) and [Erich Ludendorffs assessment of Verdun.](http://www.firstworldwar.com/source/verdun_ludendorff.htm)

Is an accurate, fair, unbiased assessment even possible at this point? Am I in need of a better source?

	A turning-point battle or campaign

	<TEXT> My thesis is that building a successful military depends primarily on three factors: motivations of patriotism/nationalism/jingoism, political motivation/will, and of course, the professional expertise to execute plans.

This is as far as democratic/free societies go; of course a dictatorship will simply build military might as they see fit.

	<TEXT> I am in New Hampshire. I have a screen capture of the ad where the claim "needs nothing" is made. I contacted the seller and asked him to take the car back for a full refund and he refused. Do I have any legal recourse? Can I sue for false advertising, or is the "needs nothing" claim to vague?

[Screen cap.](http://i.imgur.com/tNgWvSD.jpg)

**EDIT**: So the consensus seems to be that 

1. I'm an idiot.

2. I'm screwed.

3. Get a second opinion on the estimate.

I guess I'll get the second opinion, and I guess I can't sue this guy, but now I gotta figure out what to do with this car if I don't want to pay the three grand to fix it (I don't).

Thanks for your help! </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Maybe it's something personal, maybe it was good but too disturbing for multiple viewings, maybe it was to satisfy a curiosity, whatever.

For me, there's Ichi The Killer and Oldboy. Glad I saw them, but once was enough.

**EDIT**: Add Audition to the list, and for whatever reason, I used to watch those Guinea Pig movies in my young 20s. Also, Dog Tooth. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I say "last year or two" because I've seen all the classics and even most of the modern classics. If it features a well-known masked killer or is part of a franchise that requires two hands to count sequels, I've definitely seen it. 

The last horror movie I saw that I absolutely loved was The Cabin in the Woods.  </TEXT>
