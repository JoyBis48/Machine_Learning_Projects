	<TEXT> As others have said it's a mix. What's in it is up to you but I'd say cumin is generally dominant. When I make lamb kfte \ merguez I use:

* 1 1/4 teaspoons ground cumin
* 1 1/4 teaspoons ground coriander (toasted)
* 1/2    teaspoon ground cinnamon
* 1 1/4 teaspoons fennel seeds (toasted)
* 2 tablespoons harissa or ac biber salas
* 3 garlic cloves, minced

	<TEXT> agree that it's mastic. Try [making a pudding](http://ozlemsturkishtable.com/2012/09/milk-pudding-with-mastic-gum-and-rhubarb-compote/ ) from it instead of making Turkish Karanmaras dodurmasi as others have suggested which, at least when I've tried it in Turkey, doesn't really have much mastic flavor. oh and also Sahadi's is the best! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> At least on my instrument, that issue wouldn't make a sound. it would just be leaky and perhaps make the note out of tune. The reeds only sound from one direction and the leather prevents air from going through when the bellows are going the other way </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sorry I misspoke, I was referring to a putty knife not an offset spatula. Great for omelets, anything on a skillet, cleaning your cutting  board. I'm not professional but recently I've noticed one in every single professional kitchen I've peeked in. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Putty_knife </TEXT>
