	<TEXT> If there's one thing I always loved in Assassin's Creed and made me continue to buy all the games, is the environment. No matter what amount of games I play, nothing matched Assassin's Creed in that. I spent at least 50% of my time in Unity just walking around and  admiring each individual and building in Paris. Pretty much just like I did in AC2.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  It's building the world, the characters, mapping out the plot. I can spend weeks planning everything down to the smallest detail. That's when my creativity blossoms. Once I've done that, I sit down and work.

I think my problem is that I'm still stuck in the 'building' part. You see, it's just so freaking fun I can't hold myself! Writing a long novel, section by section, chapter by chapter, seems almost drudging after that. Nonetheless, it's certainly much more rewarding.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hello r/writing! 
It's been a while since I posted something here so hopefully this wouldn't break any rules or guidelines. 

So I've been writing for about two years now, and goddamn I enjoy every moment. I'm 17 years old and frankly I'd never imagine writing could be so exciting and rousing all together, nothing we did in school matched that (unfortunately so). Nonetheless before I carry on I must inform you that my English grammar is quite terrible, so if you're a keen lover of English, this tread may not suit you (I write my fiction in Hebrew, by the way).
So since my first project last summer a few things happened:

* I wrote 62k words for Random Scenes, short scenes that are mostly unrelated to the plot itself. I write those whenever Im in some kind of sentimental mood. You know, seeing the countryside I pass by each day or hearing a good Jazz tune at a quiet evening.
*  I wrote another 2k words for the history of the place my novel is set in (that includes politics, wars, feasts and so on).
* I wrote 2k for the novel itself.
The problem is, I presume, is that I get so inspired by short, everyday things and sadly that inspiration doesnt long enough for me to sit my ass down and write the storyline itself. In any case, I would like to hear the advice of writers who suffered from the same thing. 

**TL; DR** I get hooked writing the backdrop of the novel other than the novel itself. Help?

	<TEXT> I figured this would be a lovely discussion. For those who played Assassin's Creed since the first (original) game, which game topped the others in terms of:

1. Plot.
2. Hero. 
3. Time Period.
4. Environment. 
5. Soundtrack.

That's pretty much all I can think of. If you have anything notable you've liked about a particular game, write it down as well. Hopefully this will give Ubisoft a better understanding of our views and opinions. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Is there anyone French here who's willing to do a heavenly work and translate a portion of Unity's street dialogues between civilians?

Unfortunately it's french and most of us don't speak it. ):

Update: There's no good video of it on YouTube, so I'll record the dialogues myself on the PS4. Should be ready within a few days. If anyone has some footage you may post them here. The more the better.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I play on PS4 and ever since I got this game I found myself just walking around the city, recording videoclips each 100 meters.

I used to think Ubisoft could never outrank Fireze and Venice, especially after seeing how they screwed up Revelations and Black Flag, but now... I'm beginning to think Ubisoft is finally returning to its golden age.
Apart from the bugs of course.  </TEXT>
