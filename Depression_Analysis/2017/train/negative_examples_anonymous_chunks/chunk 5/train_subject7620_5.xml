	<TEXT> I agree with you on your comment on entry level chef knives, but would like to point out that this kid says he knows nothing about knives. A Victrorinox is good in this case,if I had a Tojiro or a Masakage back in the 70's my nickname would be Stubby and my knives would be rusted.I would advise a beginner to start mid-range and work up from there if they feel comfortable. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> While I agree with with Weebus that you can get sharper and better performing knives for the same or a little less money than Shuns,I wouldn't say they are vastly over-priced.It depends on what you want.Shuns are marketed toward the home user and you are paying for the look and fit and finish as well as the blade,I have a set of 6 so far and they,re all flawless and better than most crap out there. I also have a Masakage blue steel2 gyuto that puts them to shame edge-wise,same price as my biggest Shun much better blade but not as pretty and needs more care.Want a fast car that will impress people? buy an Aston-Marton.Want to go faster than every one? Buy an old model A with a 454 big block.Want to slice frozen Turkey? look here http://www.husqvarna.com/us/forest/products/xp-saws/346-xp-e-tech-triobrake/ </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you for adressing my question. I was not looking for a "polished vs rough edge" debate when I made this post,just wondering if anyone has tried a different grit on each side of the edge to improve a cheap knife that will not cut or hold an edge as well as a nice knife.I have some very nice polished knives and they would fit my needs,but I will not use them at my "battle station" nor will I take the time to treat my beater as a high end blade.Once again,thank you for your input. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes it can,but a polished edge meant for chopping will not slice a ripe tomatoe as well as a rougher edge. I use my high end stuff early in the AM for prep, then when we open I throw my beater on the board and have at it. It is a cheap knife and I am looking for the best of both worids.I have made my living with knives for the past 30+ years.Am I doing something wrong? I don't think so </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My beater knife must chop and slice equally well, plus take a major beating every day.I recently read a good article on the "toothey" vs polished debate and the author half  jokingly said  "A little toothey at the back ,and polish the rest".I thought Hmmmm?. Then I read that the guy who sharpens Masakage and other high end knives uses a different grit on each side of the blade. Has anyone tried this? any thoughts? Knife in question is a cheap German stainless blade,but a step up from the stuff from sysco ect. </TEXT>
