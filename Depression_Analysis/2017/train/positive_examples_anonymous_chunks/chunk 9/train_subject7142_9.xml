	<TEXT> That's a good idea,I thought about having a talk with him about how I'd prefer male pronoms after letting the "coming out" news sink in but casually bringing it up in a " hey it's he/him" manner without making a big deal out of it seems way more natural to me so I'm going to do that. :)

Thanks for the advice ! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Damn OP,the last sentence of your post. I feel the same way,I'm a bit younger than you are but I relate entirely.

About your goals.. take small steps and allow yourself to fail sometimes. Every little change will get you closer to what you want. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Actually I think "seemed" really nice and open-minded would have been a better choice of words.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Damn :/ 
Did you try calling him out on his shit ? Without outing yourself if you are not ready but sometimes it can work,hoped it would on my friend and it sadly didn't. Worked just fine with another friend through ! If you still want to be friends with him it can be worth a try,but honestly he doesn't seem to be a nice person to be around.  </TEXT>
