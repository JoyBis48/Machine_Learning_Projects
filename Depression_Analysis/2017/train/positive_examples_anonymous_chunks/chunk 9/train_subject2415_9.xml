	<TEXT> No, simultaneously was an option, but that is used with the plural. For example: "We did two **things** at the same time." "We did one thing **at the same time** we did the other."

	<TEXT> Hello lovelies,

So I started [Accutane](http://www.drugs.com/accutane.html) almost a week ago and my skin is already changing. I used to have the most oily skin (seriously, SO oily). Now my skin is starting to become dry. I am still oily but I have a lot of dry patches. Supposedly, my skin is going to be super dry in a few weeks.

That being said, I am totally lost as to what to do for my foundation now. I am so used to my oily skin that I just about know nothing about makeup for dry skin! So I'm hoping that you all can help me out. I am a teenager, so I'm on a budget and prefer drugstore products, but any suggestions will help. Also, I wear medium-full coverage foundations.

Thank you all so much! xo

TL;DR: I need suggestions for makeup (esp. foundation) for dry skin. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So I haven't even visited this subreddit since I reset my badge, and here I am at 44 days. It's not my longest streak, but I'm proud. I feel like this was my biggest goal: to be able to control myself to the extent that I wouldn't need to even worry about it. I think I've only had thoughts about relapsing somewhere between 1 and 5 times this past month and a half. Today, I'm proud of myself. I may not be perfect, but dammit I have self control.

Stay strong, you guys. One day hardmode will be easier than you ever dreamed. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Dammit high school sucks. I know that seems like no big deal to a lot of people, but I just feel so damn run down. No matter what I do I can't seem to get anything done. I don't get enough sleep, I don't get all my work done and I'm just so damn done with dealing with all this. It's only my sophomore year and I just want to sink into the floor. There are things I love like choir and dance team and musical but when it comes to actual classes I just want to lay in bed and cry. No kidding, all I want to do is sleep but I can't. All I can do is cry about it. I have two and a half years left and I feel so miserable. Why the hell is this so hard? I constantly feel like I'm letting someone down and my life is so full of stress I could explode. I cry all the time because I'm just so tired. Everyday I have commitments. Also, I live 45 minutes away from my school if there's no traffic, so I spend 1 1/2 hours on the road a day at the very least. I just want to relax. I want to catch my breath, sleep,  get my work done, and start again. I just want to hit pause. It's 8 pm right now and I can barely keep my eyes open because I'm so tired. And I keep getting sick because I never get any actual sleep and then I end up getting even more behind. And whenever I actually get a few hours off, I automatically try to relax because I have so much anxiety but then I find myself falling behind again. I have so many anxiety attacks because I just can't live the way I want to. There are things I want to do but my classes are holding me back. I know what I want to do with my life and barely any of my classes matter at all in the field or in my life. Like, what the hell am I doing this for? And I *have* to get good grades or else I won't be able to go to college but oh my gosh I just don't care anymore. I mean, I care about getting an education but damn why does this f***ing number have to determine so much of what I do in my life. Why can't I be happy right now? I know soon enough I'll be out of high school and maybe I'll be able to breathe and sleep and get over my anxiety but damn why can't my life be like that now. I just sit in my room and cry all the time because I just can't handle it. I'm crying right now because it's just so hard. I know that it's going to get better but why does it have to be so hard just so that I can get a diploma?

I'm aware that this is some pretty petty rambling, but I just needed to get it off my chest. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi there.

I broke my nose just over a week ago. I went to the doctor on Monday and found out that it is in fact broken, and I'm going to need surgery to put it back into place before the bones heal too much to move them. 

It's not a big deal (they're not even cutting my open, but they do need to put me under), but I need the prayers. No one, as far as I know, is praying for me. That's fine, it's not a major operation or anything like that, but I'm still having surgery and I'm nervous. I really need all the prayers I can get, if not just to calm my nerves.


Thank you all so much; I love and appreciate all of you. God bless.

P.S. My name is Nicole if you want to call me by name.

**TL;DR** I broke my nose and am having surgery. I would really appreciate some prayers.

**Update 1:** I'm about to go into surgery, and I feel very at peace. Thank you all so much who prayed; it definitely made a difference.

**Update 2:** I'm now out of surgery and doing really well. The doctor said my nose was broken worse than she originally thought, but the surgery still went very well. I can already breathe through my nose better and I feel very blessed to have this over with and be doing so well! Thank you all so much; you are amazing! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi there. Last night I beat up my nose real bad and now the entire right side of my nose and my right eye are swollen up like a balloon. Right now there's only a little bit of redness in those areas so it'll be easy enough to cover up with concealer, but eventually it's gonna turn into a real deep black and blue. Also, if there's anything I can do to distract from or some how cover up the swelling, it would be much appreciated.

Thanks! xoxo </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't think that's necessary. I've received a lot of help and inspiration here despite this. Also, a female NoFap would be so much smaller, we wouldn't receive nearly as much support. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The mental side effects, yes, are very much the same. I don't suffer from all of them, but depression, anxiety, easily distracted, disinterest, etc. As for men, some women experience a lot of them, some only a few. I personally suffer anxiety and depression that sometimes lead into things like disinterest, etc.

Obviously, the physical effects are different. Overuse can lead to dryness, itchiness, elongated labia minora (vaginal lips), loss in sensitivity, etc. I haven't really researched this, but these are things that I have experienced. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Haha(: Well I think addiction to / problems with fapping for women (schlicking, I guess, but that sounds gross) is definitely less prevalent than it is in men. Obviously, women don't have to worry about ED, low sperm count, etc., but I have noticed in myself that my labia minora (the vaginal lips, I suppose) become elongated and the vagina can become dry and itchy, which can possibly leading to things like UTI or yeast infection. It also decreases sensitivity by a large degree. Again, this isn't something I've researched, but something I have observed.

I think that most women do masturbate, they are just less prone to addiction. Many people say that's because women are more interested in the love and connection than just the sensation, which is often what men are looking for. This can lead into women caring less and less about connection and becoming addicted or they get bored and choose to never do it, or at least not that often. But really, as far as I know, women with fapping issues are definitely in the vast minority.

Sorry for the wall of text, but I hope this was helpful! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You're obviously going through something tough in your life right now, so I'm just going to ignore you. I don't know why you'd choose to follow a teenaged girls reddit account and post rude things about her, but sounds like a cry for attention to me... Maybe you should be more concerned with yourself than a stranger. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I quit because of my religion, not for attention... Hearing about what masturbation does to people through this community made me take the plunge, but that was not my reason. Also, I didn't claim to be an addict. Masturbation is more of a vice to me than an addiction. Don't pretend to know me. </TEXT>
