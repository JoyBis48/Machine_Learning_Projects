	<TITLE> UPDATE: So I [30M] relapsed and checked her [26F] Instagram page </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Here's the original post from over a year ago:

www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/16z92o/28m_broke_up_with_24f_did_i_do_the_right_thing/

Today I was going through old posts on my IG page and I saw a post she liked.  Not even thinking I clicked on her screen name.

Usually it just goes to the default "This user is private" screen.  But I guess she's public again because all her pictures showed up.

I glanced at the pics before closing the window.  She seems to be doing well but good lord is she beautiful!!  She looks even better than when I was dating her.  

I'm okay though.  I felt a little depression due to feeling like I lost a pretty good girl but I'm sure I'll get over it.

Quick rant... The older generation didn't have to deal with the social media stuff like we do.  If you broke up with someone back then it was easier to move because they weren't connected like we are.

---   
**tl;dr**: I checked my ex's IG page after a year of NC and it lead to a brief feeling of depression. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So basically women are human beings like us and there's no exact formula to getting them?  

Who knew?

But seriously, I wish more guys would realize this.  Too many times in the seduction community guys get upset when something they read on the internet doesn't work.  Women are complicated, and what works on some won't work on others.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm sure most of it has to do with my relationship with my mother and my sister.  I would definitely characterize my mom as overly controlling and critical.  She also chose other guys over me throughout my childhood.

The rest isn't true for me.  I've been to therapy, I know a lot of my feelings towards women comes from my mom.  I grew up in a household full of deceit and thought that you just accept the good in people and love them despite their screw ups.  I ruined a really good relationship because I cheated and figured, "Hey that's what people do."

But besides that, I can have a well-adjusted relationship.  I just haven't found a good girl who is intellectually stimulating as well as good in bed. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I got into Kellogg and got a 65% scholarship.  I turned down a 75% scholarship from a top 10 school and a 100% scholarship from a top 20 school.

My career goals are related to mostly marketing and product management.  I chose Kellogg because their program, brand, and alumni connections.

Now that I've been accepted the debt is starting to scare me.  I refuse to go into i-banking or consulting so the pay increase will be marginal.  (I already make six figs).

In the long run I think it will be worth it but in the meantime while I countdown the days at work, all I can think about is the crazy amount of debt I will have to take on.  (roughly $120K over the next two years).  

Could someone who has already been through this provide some perspective?  The decision has been made, I just want to feel better and snap out of this slight depression I'm in.  

I realize I'm VERY fortunate to be in this position so please don't take this post as me being ungrateful. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm going to respond to all of this and challenge most of your points.  Ready?

 I'm not like you kids. I am not 15. I'm an adult. 
 

Depression didn't hit me until I turned 26.  There's no age limit on these things.

 I have no girlfriend. No job. No house. No personality. I have achieved nothing and I have no skills.



This is nothing but negative speak, which does nothing to help.  Do you want a girlfriend?  Trust me they can be a pain in the ass too.  Are you actively working towards a job?  A house isn't a big deal.  No personality??!  WTF?  Cmon you're just beating yourself up for no reason at this point.

 I should have done electronic engineering. But I didn't. I should've gone straight into a masters program. But I didn't.

Why?  I'm an engineer and not necessarily happy.  How does going straight into a masters program help?  You could be in the same situation with more debt.  You need to be more rational about these negative thoughts your having.

 There're people my age who have children on purpose. Some of my friends have mortgages. Some of them are with the people they're going to marry.

How does any of this matter?  Children and spouses don't cure depression. All the things you listed could actually make you feel worse.


 It's not even like I'm one of these jobless losers who is like that because they spent their youth just having fun. Never been overseas. I never started a band. Why wasn't I in a band? Why didn't I do a gap year and travel? Why didn't I pursue acting? Even if I didn't become famous, at least I would've really tried. Have no regrets. Now I'm old. And I don't know what to do. When my sister has children and they ask me about my life, what am I going to tell them? That I never even tried? That they should never listen to their loser uncle? There are people who had abusive parents or got kicked out of home at 16 or had cancer and achieve 10 times what I have.
 

More pointless negative speak.  At this point you're just rambling about things that could've been with no real rationale behind it.  Be in a band?  Pursue acting?  These don't sound like things you're passionate about.  Honestly they just sound like shit to do.

 I have no energy at all. I have no motivation.

Are you willing to do something about it?  If so /r/GetMotivated is calling 

  I need drugs. I need some chemical to trick my brain into feeling like everything can still work out. 

This is the absolute WORST reason to get on meds.  Take it from me, they don't fix the root of your problems.  Start there and look into meditation if you're serious about fixing your problems.

 What do you guys do when you feel like this?
 I'm fat

Workout. Can't afford a gym /r/bodyweightfitness is calling you.  No excuses.

 , unemployed, 

Jobs don't make you happy.  Volunteer... it may provide the perspective you need about your situation.  

 old, 

We all get older.  Either come to terms with it now or be miserable forever.  Hell I've gotten older since I started typing to you.  You can still achieve things at an older age.  

 stupid, unskilled, unqualified, 

You have the internet and numerous resources to address all of these.  Harvard has free online classes for programming.  You can address your weaknesses if you really want to.

 and I live with my parents.

Take it as an opportunity to save money and reach your goal.

 I've never been suicidal, but I think I'm starting to understand it. I'm not in any immediate danger and I would never kill myself while my parents are alive, but on the other hand I don't see any realistic way out. I don't know what to fucking do.

Just reading your story there's no reason to be suicidal.  You're just in a slump.  The good thing is you can get out of it.  But only if you REALLY want to.  That's what you have to do.

Just today I came into work depressed. I logged into this subreddit and figured I'd help others.  I already feel better because I have found worth by giving advice to others.  Things can always get better.  But when you have depression you have to keep fighting.  best of luck! </TEXT>

The same seduction rules apply.  Although not literally of course.  Basically the same way I used to sit back and ask myself a million questions before approaching a girl before I overcame my fear...  I use the same mental strategies to just go up and talk to people.  Whether they're CEO's, interns, or even a secretary.  

The best tool I've learned is approaching a crowd and introducing colleagues to that crowd as an "in" or to make everyone feel comfortable.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Although I believe you can always learn new tricks, I have no problem getting girls so I use the majority of this stuff in other areas of life.

**Don't undersell the broad applicability of this information.**  Being able to approach strangers and converse with them has helped me tremendously as I've transitioned into a line of work that is almost 100% about relationship building.

I'm an introvert at heart but I've learned a lot from the PUA community when it comes to general confidence improvement.

I will admit that I feel a tad bit devilish using seduction on older married women.  But I never take it further than business.

What about you guys?
