	<TEXT> So I bought a Classic 40 pack and 14 GvG pack. Legendaries I pulled were surprisingly in good number. 

I ended up with: 1 Neptulon, 1 Golden Al'Akir the Windlord, 1 Captain Greenskin, 1 Golden Sylvanas Windrunner (already had a regular), and a Golden Sneed's Old Shredder.

The second golden had me floored, but a third just made me want to go hit the slots. Anyone have similar runs? </TEXT>

How do you even get an explicit label on an INSTRUMENTAL album? That is a feat in and of itself...I mean whoever decided to give it an explicit label was surely thinking, "This music is so 'out there' that no 'normal' person would think to make it sound the way it does."

I wonder if there is a list of instrumental albums that have explicit warnings on them. </TEXT>

Basically it is going to be sent out to LCS that order the Book of Death Event, but as an order incentive. And by the sounds of it there aren't going to be a ton of copies.

And I figure with the recent news confirming Bloodshot movies people will read The Valiant, which has Geomancer as a prominent figure. Thus leading to more people wanting to read more, i.e. when they google Geomancer I am sure this book will pop up. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Digital format does indeed use a "key" file. Usually it is just for features, but occasionally trailers need a key too (mostly high profile trailers such as Hunger Games). 

If I understand right, the MPAA can figure out exactly which theatre a recording is from by applying some kind of filter to a certain frame of a feature. 

I would imagine the BvS trailer would have a key, at least for the Premier version, and chances are that if the DC cares enough the theatre this one is recorded in can be in trouble. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I see it mentioned a decent amount on here. The reason I mentioned these two were mainly the subscription services offered to be able to catch up fairly close to current issues. 

While Image does have many good series, practically none are in the same universe, which some people like to have in their different series they are reading. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well check out Marvel Unlimited. It has most issues from a couple months back and further. (EDIT: apparently you can use the promo code Star Wars to get a free month)

Valiant was revived a couple years back and most people that have read their titles enjoyed them. You can find a good amount on Scribd. </TEXT>
