	<TEXT> My 60 y.o. mom just got an iPad and started playing clash of clans. It's the first video game she's ever played. She loves building the village, but doesn't like the attacking, and just wants to build. Are there any games like clash that have the building, but not the fighting, on the app store? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> To start with the story, I told my parents that I wanted NFL gear for the patriots, like a jersey or something. Sick bastards got me a broncos hat and a dolphins coffee mug. Only bayonetta or AW could possibly save christmas, haha :) 

Also, regardless of who gets them, I just wanted to say thank you for doing this. You never know what someone's Christmas was like, or how they're feeling right now, but I promise that just making this post made some people feel better. I'm sure all of us truly thank you for that.
