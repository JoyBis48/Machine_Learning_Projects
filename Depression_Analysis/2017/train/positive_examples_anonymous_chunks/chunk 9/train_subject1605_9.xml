	<TEXT> Except for the fact that most rail lines (let's just go with in the US because you're probably from here anyway) are publicly owned ventures and in order to upgrade these systems they would need to raise fares, maybe taxes, incur construction delays, and all of the things that are really unpopular and cause more uproar than a derailment. Not to mention its cheaper to pay out a settlement than all the upgrades necessary.

But yeah, no its those damn unions. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The shunning is really the biggest thing. They tend to be stuck in the 50's morality-wise, knee length skirts, supervised courtship, etc. So nothing like Scientology crazy. 

By and large the just cutting off immediate family members entirely, like my mom did to my brother, her own son. Literally nothing more than 'Hello.' </TEXT>

	<TEXT> OK, fine. You want to be a smartass. I'm game.

Did you intent to cut the person? If you did that would be a felony. Did the resulting injuries cause the person's death? Well shit I guess it did.

If you intentionally injure someone and the end result is their death, YES SMARTASS, THAT'S FUCKING MURDER. 

There is no 'its just a prank bro' if someone fucking dies. JESUS FUCKING CHRIST. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The funniest thing about all this is that I grew up JW and this was a very real situation for me. At any point in time I could have been in a car accident and I'd have been FUCKED. 

We don't let children make medical or legal decisions, for good reason, they generally don't have the critical thinking skills to make the best choice. So parents make the decision. Yeah, its a shit decision, but legally speaking, they are the ones who have the final say. 

I'm not a JW, and I have no intention to be, but if you want to be the one to take a shit all over the constitution, just try. </TEXT>
