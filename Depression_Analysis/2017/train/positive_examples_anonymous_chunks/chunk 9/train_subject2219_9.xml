	<TEXT> I've been doing indica for a while now and even my dealer can't source sativa. The way it works where I'm from is everything is just called 'weed' and your dealer just gives you whatever he has on him. Not asking for buying advice (rules) just wondering what sativa is like to get your hands on with other Ents

	<TEXT> Im starting college next month and Im hoping to bulk up and continue working out through college.

The past 3 days ive used this plan:
20kg benchpress x 10 reps x 3 sets
Sit ups x 15 reps x 4 sets
Bicep curls 8kg x 10 reps x 3 sets
Butterfly leg lifts 2kg x 5 reps x 3 sets
I also run 4 miles twice a week. 

 I would like to up the intensity of my workout and depending on whether I stick with the plan, I'll get on protein. Can someone help organise a schedule with me? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Depression in a relationship is hard. I've been there, and my SO found it extremely difficult and began to blame herself and wonder was it something she was doing that was making me feel constantly dark. She lost her patience with me and cheated. It was awful. If your SO loves you they will be patient with you and help you find all the care and help, be it through therapy or medication, you need to return a succesful relationship, both a sexually and mentally healthy relationship </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The fact you posted this for help, and also resisted your temptation shows you're more than able to recover. Try taking a deep breath, calming yourself, and pin your hands down your pockets and keep them there. Alternatively, perhaps seeing a therapist once off, or an anger management tutor. Maybe it's a past experience that makes you want to throw a punch? </TEXT>
