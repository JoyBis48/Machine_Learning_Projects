	<TITLE> Swatches and Mini Review of NARS Dual Intensity Eyeshadow Singles </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-12-28 04:52:40 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> These shadows are absolutely gorgeous. I received them as a Christmas gift and was floored at how beautiful they were. They're called Dual Intensity because they're meant to either be applied wet or dry (like you can do with most shadows) but the difference between the two is crazy. They're a light sweep of shimmer when applied dry, but the pigment when applied wet is so gorgeous. It's a little bit pricey for eyeshadow singles, but I am so happy they were gifted to me! I'm IN LOVE with them!

	<TEXT> The two shades are Himalia (left shade in picture, top two swatches) and Dione (right shade in picture, bottom two swatches). I got these as a Christmas gift and they are honestly so gorgeous. They're made to either be applied dry or wet, and as you can see they are both absolutely gorgeous either way. They're so creamy, and the pigment when wet is absolutely beautiful. They're a bit pricey for eyeshadow singles, but I am absolutely IN LOVE with them!!!! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks, but none of these seem to help in my situation, I'm more looking to see if I'm eligible for rematch due to my gift being under the 20 dollars and what looks to me as a "send as little as possible so I still receive a gift"

Edit: of course this is just perspective on the gift.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I guess my added frustration is that I had a very detailed likes and dislike plus an extended wish list from the Reddit Marketplace, and my secret Santa never once contacted me. They also retrieved my info the day before shipping was supposed to happen. I will post it to the gallery without complaining because I honestly don't want to hurt my SS's feelings, I was just wondering if there was anything I could do to  make my gift exchange experience more positive  </TEXT>
