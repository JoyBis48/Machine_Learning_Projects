	<TEXT> Wow.  You're amazing! You've seriously inspired me to get back at running and lifting. And recording what I eat.  Can i ask though. When you were dieting and only running did you use protein shakes or not till after you started to lift too? Also did you keep up cardio once you started to lift?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> He kept them all no idea why. He sent me this pic once when i was away at college.  He broke walls too and also doors..  I woke up one morning cause i could hear him cursing and he was dumping an entire can of arizona fruit punch on his $2000 gaming pc. Safe to say he probably shouldn't be playing online games.  Never did stuff like that unless he was playing with people he couldn't see. So much wasted money on controllers and new ps3's.  Ugh  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Honestly I've tried outside in winter. The cold cold (like current temps)  causes old injuries to become very stiff and sore.  For reference I've torn my Achilles tendon and hamstring (on oppsite legs) anyway ill run usually outside right up till dec after that unless it's mild i really can't its more like trudging through feet of snow/ice rather than a run anyway.. Dunno </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I used to be an avid runner, and by this I mean I used to run 6/7-7/7 days a week. Now its more like 1/7 if that. (boo) I'd really like to get back into running again. Though being that its winter and I really hate the cold its hard for me to get back into running with only the use of the treadmill at the gym. I find it very boring. So I've come to reddit to see how runners here keep motivated in the winter to run indoors. (since for me outside will have to wait till spring) </TEXT>
