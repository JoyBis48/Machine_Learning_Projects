	<TEXT> Good idea. Also, as bad as my grades are, because as stated before I'm apparently a fucking idiot or can't school or whatever, I'm wondering how much should I space it out. Yeah I could work 2 part time 20hr a week jobs and take 3 classes a semester, but as said, if I get 2 more C's I'm out. I need to fund myself, but more importantrly if I'm going to make this gamble I need to improve my shitty self 200%  </TEXT>
