	<TEXT> They only care in the US if you're suicidal, and even then you still have to pay the treatment costs. I have to pay 3,000 dollars out of pocket before my insurance will even look at my mental health treatment (diagnosed major depressive disorder). Sorry she won't take her meds, thats frusterating. that combined with therapy could really do wonders </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In the county jail i worked at in PA, you would write a request slip to the counselor/case manager in charge of workers. at that facility, you could do inside work even if you werent sentenced, but needed to be sentenced for outside work. Be nice to the counselor! dont write 2000 requests, be patient. if they didnt get back to you in a week, write another. good for you for wanting to work, itll definitely make your time go faster. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My former psychiatrist would always always tell me I needed to work out more, and it only triggered me to do the opposite. I've switched doctors (for reasons unrelated), we took me off meds, and this is my third day at the gym. I'm feeling great and wanted to introduce myself. 

My goal is to lose the extra weight added on during the height of my Depression, and keep my mood regulated. 

Here goes nothin'  </TEXT>
