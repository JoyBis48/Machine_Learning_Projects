	<TEXT> I didn't care for it. A bunch of people with chronic pain were excited about it but it ended up poorly portraying people like us. So I may be bias. She did a good job acting when it comes to being in pain, but at the same time real people with constant pain become good at hiding it. So it seemed a little dramatic to me. I guess that works for the majority demographic though.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm pretty sure I have mastocytosis. It can be inconvenient for me at times but it's not much of a problem for me. At least not compared to the other stuff. Though it varies from case to case like EDS.       
My hands and feet swell sometimes. My face will get hot and flushed. And I get a few hives here and there. One time I had them really badly for three months and in that time things like my lips would swell up and I looked like some kind of plastic surgery nightmare. Or my feet were so swollen i had to crawl to the bathroom. That was way back in high school and we never figured out why it happened until now but it hasn't happened since.        
For the most part it isn't that bad, I do also have a dumpy immune system though.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The symptoms for mastocytosis are confusing. My hands and feet swell and turn red often, sometimes because of exercise or having a drink, other times for no reason. I also had severe hives for three months one time. It was insane. I have also always had a crappy immune system. So I assume I have mast cell disease. It's sort of the least of my problems though.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have messed around with silks before and they gave me major bruises. I used to be a contortionist and performed with a sideshow as well as playing wash tub bass with a band. Then I started feeling awful and figured out that the hypermobility is part of the problem. Which led me to realize I have EDS as well as some of the conditions that come with it. I can still play my ukulele banjo but I have osteoarthritis in my hands so that won't last long.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have a slurry of physical and mental health problems. I am 23 and can't go to the grocery store and take a shower in the same day.       
Let's see if I can remember most of them.         
Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, osteoarthritis, dysautonomia, POTS, hyperthyroidism, TMJ, and fibromyalga.       
Then I have depression of course and have had a couple bouts of psychotic depression, severe anxiety which is amplified by my thyroid problem. And I am possibly bipolar.       
Generally I am a really easy going person but with all my health problems I become pretty useless at times.       
My physical health is pretty bad due to the ehlers-danlos. In a literal sense I am actually falling apart.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I actually had to leave my job due to unfortunate health problems. It was a wonderful job though and I am hoping to go back. I worked at a dog rescue. So there was about 200 dogs at the warehouse I worked at. Most of the people that do the grunt work like myself are dirty punk kids. Having face tattoos is a normal thing there.       
I mostly walked the dogs and had several breaks throughout the day. Being the sick person I am I would take naps on top of the huge pallets of dog food despite there being tourists walking around looking at the dogs. It is a fairly laid back place so long as you are doing your job.        
Dirtiest job I have ever had. Also the best. Those dogs are hard to not fall in love with. Working with people who are also grossly obsessed with the dogs is a bonus.         
That specific rescue also happens to be somewhat famous so it was interesting trying to avoid cameras and super fans. </TEXT>

No the bridge piercing does not go through the bone.      
I really really really do not want attention. I look the way I do because it is what I like, I seriously hate all the clothes that would make me look normal. I know I will always get stared at in public and that's fine, but please leave me alone.         
The only time I care for attention from strangers is when I am on a stage actively desplaying myself which I no longer do because I am disabled.       
I just want to live happily ever after with a dozen dogs and my big heavily tattooed mexican boyfriend.  </TEXT>

But I guess I got over it because before I had time to deal with it my health also caused me to have to leave my job and all the dogs I love that I worked with. Then I left my home, my lover, my step dog, and my life all because I can't take care of myself at 23. So I guess the other things sort of went on the back burner.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> There's just nothing. My tramadol stopped working so I stopped taking. I wasn't on it for very long but it is definitely effecting me coming out of my system. I had weird dreams last night when I finally managed to sleep for a couple hours.  Now I still feel all gross about it. My mom is being awful and it is the worst timing. I just want to go home back to my life. I want to try Lyrica and maybe that will help. I will even try some of the woo woo herbal shit. But I am done trying to get to the bottom of this. My ship is capsizing and I am not going to watch my life sink to the bottom so I can go try and find some mythical mermaid medical treatment. Fuck this. I am done with my health ruining my life. Fuck my health. There is no need for it if I can't have a life anyway. I'm 23 and don't have time for this shit. I need to go back home to my partner and the dogs. I need my life back. I don't care if I have to work covered in braces.       
I haven't always made the best decisions in life, but I at least had decisions to make and usually knew which ones were right. Now I don't even really have any options or they all seem like bad ones.        
This is MY life. I demand the right to fuck it up on my own or have enough control to actually make it work. I'm sick of doctors making it about my depression. Of course I am fucking depressed! Look at this shit! I shouldn't be here!      
If I can find meds that will take the edge off I am just going to suck it up and go back to work. It doesn't matter anymore. I already know what I have to lose and my health is the least of them. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Seriously. I mean I do enjoy browsing this sub and all but the animal stuff is different. That dog can have a future but she is being given a home from a non profit business. That business relies on donations to keep going and already has 500 dogs to feed, bed, clean, walk, love, and pay for all their vet bills. And most of them have heartworm which has to be treated but it's not cheap. The dog I am getting from there is actually still there only because she is on heartworm treatment.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My good friend was working as a delivery driver in Seattle. He had a delivery for Nye. When he opened the door he grabbed the package and shut the door in my friends face. My friend knocked again because he needed the papers signed. Nye opened the door and barked about no autographs and my friend hardly had a chance to tell him he just needed the paperwork signed for his job. Nye didn't even apologize or anything.        
It's sad because my friend loved Bill Nye and he is like the sweetest guy ever. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Jimmy Page being a creep and kidnapping a 14 year old girl and then marrying her.       
But more importantly Bill Nye being a dick. I have heard a few stories but one is from one of my close friends. Not impressed Bill.       
I mean I know he is a scientist and all and being famous sucks. But he made a kids show. My whole generation idolizes him. But no, he has to go shit all over our childhoods.        
But I have also met some pseudo celebrities that are great. Patch Adams (like the Robin Williams film but the guy it's about) is really wonderful. I see him at a festival every year. And the cast from Pitbulls and Parolees are great. Particularly Tia who's life really does revolve around those dogs.          
Edit: Names are hard. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't know how I would have that much dark shit going on when I was five. But it's not really like that. I have had anxiety attacks which are awful and like that. The dream thing is a completely different flavor of fucked up. That's not what little girls should have going on.       
The dream though actually reminds me of something I heard later on though. I think it was about people in east Germany that lived near the Berlin Wall. The men would begin to dig a hole to tunnel under so they could escape with their families. But they couldn't just have big dirt piles laying around. So every day they would fill their lunch boxes with dirt and dump it at work. Which would end up taking years. I don't even know where I learned that. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I had a dream when I was little that I had a house, but for some reason the house was full of mounds and mounds of salt. I don't know why or under what context but I was only allowed to remove one pinch of salt a day.        
It wasn't so much the content of the dream as it was the feeling I had the whole time. It is by far the worst feeling I have ever had in my life and sometimes I almost have flashbacks of it. There are certain things that cause it but one of them is touching one of my pinkys a specific way. I have had pretty severe anxiety most of my life but whatever that is is a whole different level. When it happens I can't get rid of the feeling until it goes on its own.       
I'm not sure if it happened around some traumatic event I don't remember or if it was a fever dream. Maybe both. I know I hallucinate pretty badly when I have fevers. But there is also some suspicion that I have blocked out some kind of trauma from my early years.        
I would like to figure out what the fuck that's about but I sort of figure it will just cause a major nervous breakdown in a decade or so and I will find out then. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Need advice on my lack of treatment/medical equipment. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-07-01 03:03:19 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> This whole year I have gone from doctor to doctor trying to get taken seriously. I *think* I finally found a decent GP, I have PT tomorrow for the first time, and I had an appointment with another rheumatologist. Had as in until today when the office called me and dumped me because he doesn't treat EDS.        
I am trying so hard to get better but there's nothing else I can do. I am completely debilitated lately. And to make it worse I have to work somewhere for a few days in a week or so. Which I am stressed about. I am already trying to deal with the fact that I have to work outside in the sun and dust for four days and won't be able to get the proper pain medication. When I already have a hard time putting my hair in a bun.       
I know I need braces for my wrists, elbow, and knees (probably my hips too but I don't feel like looking like fucking buzz lightyear). It is a bummer I couldn't get medical help sooner so I could have things like that by now.       
What is really getting to me is that I feel like I would **really** benefit from forearm crutches. Which is already enough of a bummer on its own but I can't even talk to a doctor about it. I think they would help because my legs get so tired and weak from walking. Not because of dislocations or anything. And the place I have to work has a lot of walking to do.         
To make it worse every time I bring it up to my parents they don't say much and give me a look like I am being dramatic. I think that if I had more support and I could talk to my mom about it I would just end up buying a pair before I have to go work. But without reinforcement I feel stupid about it. It's sort of embarrassing.         
What do you think? Maybe I shouldn't be making such a big deal and wait to see the right doctor? I don't know.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Like the other day. In the past ten months my pain has become crippling. In a week or so I have a festival that I work at every year (I grew up going and it is important to me). I have been stressed out about how I will manage working with all my pain. There is so much walking to to there that it has always been exhausting for me even when I didn't work. So I got to thinking it would be much easier to stand for my five hour shift if I didn't have to walk everywhere. Then it hit me. But I doubt I can make that happen by then. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The way doctors. act you would think they know much more about mental health than they do.        
Every time I explain how bad my chronic pain is and how it effects my life I end up crying. Doctors immediately skip over the physical stuff and go straight to asking about my depression. As if that is the most likely cause of my crippling pain. I had to leave my job, home, dogs, boyfriend, and life in general because of my body. I am 23 and can hardly put my hair up. Yeah I'm fucking depressed. I am pretty sure that is a reasonable response to that.  </TEXT>

I have a connective tissue disorder so my neck has always hurt because it's not strong enough to support my head. But it's not as bad as my jaw, hands, elbow, and hips. The only thing that really helps my neck is massage. Even when opiate pain pills take away my pain it gives me a different sometimes worse pain in my neck. </TEXT>
