	<TEXT> Hello :) thank you so much! 

I actually studied psychology in uni :) but nothing you learn, nothing can prepare you for depression until you have it. 

I think in 'on the road to recovery' but I have huge dips in out and out of it I think. 

I also like to help people, I have a 'smile a day' Motto I'm trying to keep up everyday and it's to help of make someone help every day. Helping other people makes me feel like a better person, better person means a happier me. Because depression makes me feel worthless. 

I usually just tell people I suffer with bad anxiety they say something and I say 'yeah it's odd isn't it, I don't know what causes it I just feel anxious now and then' people seem to give me a break more. Like people can understand feeling anxious and scared but they can't understand depression </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Is depressed people tend to go over and over things a lot in our heads, repeating things that have already been resolved. I feel like I'm not listened to by the two people I love most in the world. So when I feel like I'm not listened to or they know what's best, I just think I'm a burden. Maybe they act differently because they are fed up of me and just going through the motions. 

That's why I write everything down, because different days I feel differently, or I see things differently. Sometimes worse, sometimes better. At least with writing everything down you can get everything out and you can go back and read it and try and figure out what happened at that time that made you feel that way. Could it have been avoided or do you need to talk to that person. 

Maybe you could try that? Depressed people are very paranoid :( we push away the people who are trying to help.
