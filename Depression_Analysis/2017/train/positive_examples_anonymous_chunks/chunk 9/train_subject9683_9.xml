	<TEXT> Clearly it's the dude says these beautiful quotes (DIGGLE!!!!): 

* "Damnit Oliver, you would've been dead ten times over if it wasn't for me"
* "I guess from now on, I'll be watching you pee"
* "My secret identity is his black driver"
* "You know, Oliver, somebody once told me that secrets have weight. The more you keep, the harder it is to keep moving."
* "Felicity, I don't think there's a force on earth that can make you a bad person."
* "Things are as good now as ever will be Oliver. And you love her. You even told her so." ... (Oliver: "I was trying to fool Slade.") ... "Yes, except now the only person you're fooling is yourself."

**Currently my favourite Diggle Quote**:

* " I don't know. For the first time since I met Oliver Queen I don't know what happens next. I know it's silly, but I still like to think of myself as Oliver's bodyguard. I just couldn't protect him. It's funny. He was worried something would happen to me."

	<TEXT> Merlyn is affiliated with the LoA in the comics, and the only reason the League was even a huge plot was because of Merlyn. Other than that, it was just some assassin group that Sara joined. Also, Black Canary has ties to the LoA as well. So the Sara/Nyssa and Laurel/Nyssa scenes were a nod to that. </TEXT>
