	<TEXT> As a 25 y/o person who's just coming to terms with a lot of stuff about myself that I'd just chosen to ignore for the most part until recently...

The disliking straight sex thing is something that totally resonates with me and something I've only recently come to accept. I would probably still describe myself as bi at this point (I definitely still crush hard on and fantasise about people regardless of gender, I think) but this has been a big wake up call for me personally that actually the thought of living a purely hetero life seems incredibly unappealing to me.

I've also found it difficult to accept these feelings because I have a crazy inferiority complex in most things, and am actually pretty terrified of girls despite being one myself. I'm not a tomboy and am feminine in most respects, but I've always seen myself as an outsider to 'girlkind' in general, which I know is ridiculous. The idea of dating or sleeping with a girl terrifies me because I feel like an outsider and find the idea of sticking with dating guys to be more familiar and 'safe' ("I don't know enough about queer culture, what if I get rejected and laughed out as not worthy of being part of the gay community? I'm not pretty enough to date other girls. It's too late for me to start dating girls. No girl would want to be with me when I'm not a 'gold star' lesbian and totally clueless about gay sex.." etc. ).

For so long I just interpreted these feelings of apprehension as "yeah, I guess I don't like girls...not really" and swept it under the rug. I know, I'm super lame :p

Plus, as I mentioned elsewhere, there's all that lady porn I love...

	<TEXT> Yeah I used to think that that would be ok, and the idea of using unisex bathrooms doesn't bother me, as I'm sure it doesn't many peeps. But you also have to remember that folks using those spaces expect there to only be a certain type of people there, and could feel threatened or uncomfortable if those expectations are 'violated'. This raises all kinds of questions for non-binary people and like I say, I'm sure most don't mind but it's always good to be respectful of that. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If it makes you feel better, I think in a 'safe feeling' environment, most people wouldn't  be too bothered if someone of the opposite sex walked in accidentally. Maybe, as a tiny female if I were in a strange place alone and this happened I'd feel a bit scared, but after them realising and leaving, making it very obvious they were there accidentally, I wouldn't give it a second thought.

One time I walked into a men's room and didn't realise until I came out the stall (there were no urinals and I guess I wasn't paying too much attention :p) to see a guy washing his hands. I went into mega apology mode but he seemed more amused by it than offended. I think so long as you are respectful of spaces and situations like that then you can't go far wrong, like I say, most aren't too fussed though :p </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah I was going to say, that stuff is pretty solid advice. It's a shame about the rest of TRP philosophy regarding interpersonal relationships and the whole community being a pit of roiling despair and insecurity but yeah, good general advice for anyone.

Edit: In fact my advice to that kid, to any kid going through the emotional and self-esteem rollercoaster that is puberty, is to just go with that first lot of advice. Forget all the specific TRP drivel and just go out there and make yourself a better person, don't worry about coming back and getting validation from bitter strangers on the internet about it afterwards. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I often see the work of one the researchers at my undergrad uni cited by TRPers. Chiefly studies about how facial preferences can be influenced by female hormones, those kinds of things, mostly. They're usually given as examples of how feeemales are driven by their hormones to jump on strangers' dicks the moment they start ovulating. However, having taken his module and read his (really cool and highly valued) work, that just...isn't a valid interpretation of his findings at all, it's certainly not the conclusion he himself has come to. A lot of his work actually contributes to the large body of studies suggesting that women don't by default go for alpha jocks all the time, that sexual attraction and preferences are multifaceted, nuanced and above all *adaptable, and highly individual*. Pretty much the opposite of the paranoid black and white bullshit TRPers run with.

	<TEXT> Yes, I think from what I remember, it's because women tend to choose different methods such as pills or wrist slashing. Men tend to choose hanging, shooting themselves, CO poisoning, etc. that have higher rates of effectiveness. Which makes sense; more men are likely to be confident in how to use firearms/cars than women, according to traditional gender roles, and therefore use them as their method of choice. 
As a female (lel) I can say that I haven't access to, nor the knowledge of how to kill myself effectively with a gun or through CO poisoning, so I'd probably stick to overdose or bleeding, and I know that these aren't necessarily as effective.

Edit: but seriously, fuck ROK. Using suicide in some sort of point-scoring "hur yeah, men are just the best, even at suicide, SO ALPHA BRO" against female suicides is disgusting. The higher male suicide rate is tragic and heartbreakingly indicative of how much we need to support mens' emotional expression and mental health and this is just such  counterproductive, distasteful bullshit. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'd also be happy to Skype as I feel like I'm in a similar situation (moved to a new place with bf and don't really know anyone, definitely need to put in some effort to meet new people but find it hard), we could maybe have group chat or whatever. 

Anyway, I came to this thread to suggest something that I read in Susan Cain's book, 'Quiet' that might be helpful: have a rule where you make yourself do something you'd maybe find socially daunting X number of times a week/month/whatever works for you. Once you have done this then don't worry or admonish yourself if you then stay in and excuse yourself from other social events etc. 

For example, this evening I'm off out with a few people from work and this will be the first time I've done anything social with them outside of work before, naturally I'm a bit nervous. I'm sure it will probably be enjoyable if anything once I'm there but the point is that doing so will be tiring and a little stressful for me. But once that is done I 'don't have to' do anything social like that for the rest of the week. I can stay home and do my own thing all weekend if I choose and not feel guilty or dwell on how I did or anything. Next week I have to push myself 'out there' another time, and then forget about it, and so on. Hope that makes sense :3

Edit:It's an approach that works for me because while it encourages me to push myself socially, I have a clear point when I can say "and now the 'me time' begins" and just chill </TEXT>
