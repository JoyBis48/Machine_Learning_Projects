	<TEXT> You need to get back into some sort of talking therapy if possible.

You could also try giving yourself time limits for doing things like standing near a window, then an open window, then by the door, then with the door open, then just outside. Slowly build up your confidence in getting out of the place when you really don't want to?

Sending internet hugs to you, I know that feeling all too well x </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you. I have had panic attacks previously, but these seem to be longer and more subtle than the panic rushes I have had before. I am still getting the intense panic 'rushes' but also an ongoing sense of panic and dread that is lasting for hours, but at slightly lower levels than regular panic attacks.
I try to regulate my breathing, and I use the relaxation techniques that my therapist taught me. Unfortunately, because I have some agoraphobic issues, going for a walk is not always an option. I will try the positive reinforcement though. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My anxiety is bad at the moment.

So bad it has morphed back to panic attacks, trying to hide from the world, physical symptoms (stomach issues, headaches).

I am so tired from trying so hard not to let this ruin my life, but every time I think I have a handle on it, it all just creeps back in, worse and worse every time.

I am going through some shitty stuff at the moment, husband has told me, but not yet decided, that he may or may not want to stay married, living 4000 miles from friends and family, kids being 4 and 7 years old and acting accordingly, just had fairly heavy surgery and also trying to work full time.

I am trying to stay positive and remember that 'this too shall pass' but right now I want to get up, walk out and not come back.

But I won't because that voice of responsibility, and owing it to everyone to make it ok, in my head wont let me. </TEXT>

Ended up having an overy removed, should know more/why once I have spoken to y surgeons asistant.

On lots of painkillers. Had some good sleep on them which is nice.

	<TEXT> Thank you. I have had similar surgery before to remove an ovarian cyst. But as the cannot identify the exact cause of my pain right now, they are doing the exploratory to try and find if there is a cyst hiding, adhesions, or something else going on. I have given her permision to do what is needed once she is in there. I was sterilized last year, so there will be no really big issues if for example an ovary needs removing. I think it is fear of the anaesthetic and not having control, as well as not knowing the outcome until I come round. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I am having an exploratory laparoscopy tomorrow to try and find the cause of intense abdominal pain that I have been having for a month now. 

I hate having general anaesthetics, I get very anxious and scared and my worst case scenario thinking comes out in full force.

I am struggling to stay calm about it tonight. Even though I know it is a relatively minor procedure, they will not know what they need to do to resolve any problems until they are in there.

I know my surgeon and trust her, but it is still scary to me and I am going over all the things that could go wrong in my head. It is not helping that I am having to take strong painkillers and they are clouding my ability to process my thoughts logically.

I am going to be a nervous wreck going in there, and last time I remember crying as they put me under because I was so scared that I was never going to wake up again.

So I am feeling miserable and in pain and just looking for a bit of support and sympathy :-(


**edit** So I am home safe and sound, but minus one ovary. I will find out more tomorrow when my surgeon cals. Thanks for all the hugs and comments of to take my mahooosive painkillers now xxxx


**edit** **2** so it was a twisted fallopian tube abd scar tissue surrounding the ovary. No wonder it hurt!! </TEXT>
