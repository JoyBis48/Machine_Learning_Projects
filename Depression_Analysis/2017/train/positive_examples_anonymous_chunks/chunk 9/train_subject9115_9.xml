People who like to say "a private company can censor whatever they want," in regards to Reddit don't seem to know it's official policy for them not to. 

Redditors who bring free speech into it are referring to that policy, not because they think Reddit doesn't have a legal right to censor whatever they please. </TEXT>

 the depiction of erotic behavior (as in pictures or writing) intended to cause sexual excitement

And the Supreme court has ruled that nude photos/videos of children are legal as long as they aren't sexually stimulating.  

Look at the movie Pretty Baby. It had a full frontal shot of a 12-year-old Brooke Shields nude. Romeo and Juliet from 1968 has nudity from a 16 and 17-year-old. American Beauty had a shot of 17-year-old Thora Birch's boobs. None of those movies will get you arrested for child porn. </TEXT>

They insist the Civil War wasn't about slavery (seriously, reading the declaration of secession of those certain states tells you it was, so people aren't even studying the issue on their own) and they have no idea that the Confederate flag was put up in the 60s on government buildings to protest the civil rights movement. People flat out oppose unions and government regulation because they have no idea what it was like before we had those things.

General education makes people more well read and aware of the world around them. 

Trades are great and should be subsidized, but education isn't useless and valueless if it won't land you a job. It's important for your voting population to be educated. </TEXT>

Geneticists have estimated that 10% of men are unwittingly raising kids that aren't theirs, so a paternity test is a very reasonable request.

	<TITLE> What exactly are the margins of error in a pregnancy dating ultrasound making room for? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-07-11 22:35:05 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I read that dating ultrasounds during and before the 13th week are pretty accurate because fetuses are growing at the same rate at this point, but the margin of error is a whole week, some say 8 days. 

Is this margin of error accounting for slight differences in the CRL of each fetus, slight mistakes the tech might make (millimeters are very tiny, a mouse click too soon or too late could throw off the measurement), or maybe both? </TEXT>

Now, you're allowed to vote for who most shares your ideals. You can vote for someone who believes tax dollars shouldn't go to the poor. That counts as your say in how that revenue should be spent.

	<TITLE> Potential kidnapping attempt in parking lot. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-07-10 00:02:52 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Last year I worked in retail, and I was out in the parking lot getting the carts. We had been closed for about 15 minutes. It wasn't unusual for cars to stop by close to me and ask if we were closed around this time, so when a red car did so I didn't think it was strange.

He rolled down the window and asked, "Are you guys closed now?"

I answered, "Yep, 15 minutes now." 

Usually the cars drive off at this point, but this guy (I honestly can't remember what he looked like, since I didn't think it was weird at the time so he didn't stick out) asked, "Could you come here for a second then?"

I have the carts lined up now and I don't have time to deal with a customer who I've just informed the store is closed. I just want to get my tasks done, help my co-workers with their tasks, and see if we could get out out of there in a hurry. 

I tell the man, "No, sorry. I have to get these carts up to the store so we can lock the doors." 

He insists, "I just have a question, it won't take a moment to answer. Can you just come help me?" 

I'm a little unnerved by this, but I just say, "Sorry, I can't," and begin to push the carts to the store. Thankfully he just drove away.

The scary thing is that when I got up to the store, the front doors were locked. They weren't supposed to be locked until everyone was done working outside for safety issues just like this, but sometimes they got locked early for some reason. I pressed the buzzer that let the manager in the office know I was outside, and she let me in. 

But if that guy had gotten it into his mind to stay in the parking lot and saw that the front doors were locked and I was stuck outside, what then? Would he have tried to abduct me?

I was still unnerved, but not really shaken or disturbed. The full impact of what could have happened hit me when I got home. I always told my boyfriend about any weird or annoying customers I encountered during my shift, and when I told him about this, he asked, "Did you tell the manager?" 

I said no, and he scolded me. "The guy was an obvious creeper, and you didn't think to tell anyone?" He even wanted to alert the police, but I didn't see the point because the only thing I could remember about the car was that it was red. I couldn't even tell you what type it was. The man's features weren't really distinguished at all either.

Maybe nothing would have happened and the guy didn't realize how creepy be was being, but in any case, I'd rather not meet again. </TEXT>

Because literature and writing, while being important and valuable subjects, don't bring in the money.

I'm pretty much stuck being an office assistant my entire life because the only college majors that earn you any money are basically math and science...my two worst subjects.
