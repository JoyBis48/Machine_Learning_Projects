	<TEXT> That feels like such a revelation, all the comments here are so completely inspiring and all I can think is- wow, this never occurred to me but you all are right. Thank you seriously this improved my outlook a lot. I'm still getting used to the shiny new issues that have been assigned to me, and every bit of support helps me get a little farther along in the journey (cliche party \m/ ) I'm sure this is how everyone in this subreddit feels and I hope I can help people too </TEXT>
