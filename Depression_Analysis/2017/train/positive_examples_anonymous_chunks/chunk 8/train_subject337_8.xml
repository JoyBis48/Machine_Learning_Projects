When something is in pounds, it's easier to imagine how much weight that actually is. I.e. 2.4 mil lbs sounds a lot heavier than 1200 tons. Might just be me though. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm wondering if we will see a trend of violent sociopaths becoming police as a cover. With the news covering nothing but the deaths at the hands of police, it seems like a logical move. I also wonder if maybe that trend has already started, which is why there are so many police acting this way. I find it hard to believe that a typical empath could end a person's life without just cause and be ok with it. This goes a little beyond just an abuse of power. Thoughts? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is a great answer.

Through high school, I thought I was really bad at math because I was struggling to understand algebra, and I really didn't care about it. When I got to college and took calculus, I fell in love with it, and every advanced math class after. If they could make primary math as interesting as advanced math I think more people would be good at it. </TEXT>
