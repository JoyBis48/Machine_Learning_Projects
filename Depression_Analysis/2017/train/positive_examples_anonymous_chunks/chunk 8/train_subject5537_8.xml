	<TEXT> The bit that really impressed me was the second pass from Fabregas. I could be wrong, but it looks to me like he wasn't expecting the return pass from the first player (don't know who it is), and even if he was, the pass looked like it was hit back at him way too hard, but he still managed to thread the ball straight to the feet of the guy on the edge of the box with the outside of his foot! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> While I do follow F1, I've never been so into it that I know all the technicalities of it, and was wondering if someone could explain something to me. In the years that Vettel was winning the WDC, Red Bull were almost untouchable, but now that's what's happening for Mercedes, while Red Bull are competing with the likes of Williams etc.

What is it that allows one team to improve so much from one season to the next, as Mercedes have done, or as Red Bull did when they dominated? I don't understand where this massive disparity comes from.

Thanks! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What she said echoes my own feelings on this. I went cage diving with great whites in South Australia, expecting it to be a terrifying adrenaline rush, but it was nothing of the sort. When you're in the water with them you do see that they are nothing like they're portrayed in the media. Graceful is the exact word I use to describe them to other people. The only reason people get pictures like this is because they pull the bait away from the shark as they get near it making them do the big CHOMP CHOMP thing.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think this is the reason I don't feel primarily British. Because England is by far the biggest country in Britain, a lot of people say British, when they mean English (especially people who don't live here).

Despite sharing a border, I actually think Scotland and England are two very different places. So quite often when people talk about British culture, or British identity, when they actually mean English, I just don't relate to any of it, so I don't have that connection.

Another thing is that the mainstream British media is heavily anglo-centric, again due to the population etc. and it's hard to feel like you're part of Britain when the overwhelming majority of stories etc. are centred around England. </TEXT>

Sensationalizing a title makes it look like you just want karma IMO.

	<TEXT> I have to say, I'm the complete opposite, and the results of this survey have actually been a bit of an eye opener for me.

If anyone ever asks me what nationality I am, I will always say Scottish. If they then ask if that makes me British, I'd answer yes. But I would never even think to answer British in the first instance, and I assumed that most people would be the same i.e. they would say English or Welsh before British, but seemingly not!

So while I certainly consider myself British, I'm definitely in the "Scottish first, British second" camp.

And yet, my username contains UK! I'm a walking hypocrite.

	<TEXT> This was the semi final of the Champions League in 2007-2008. Chelsea and Liverpool had drawn the first leg 1-1, and the second leg had finished 1-1 after full time, so extra time was being played. The penalty put Chelsea ahead 2-1, and they went on to win that game overall, 3-2.

The added significance of the penalty is that Frank Lampard was taking it, and his mother had died in the week leading up to the game, so there was a huge emotional aspect to it as well. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There was a really good piece by Pat Nevin last year about Liverpool and how they needed to learn to be more patient when they needed goals, and just keep passing the ball, rather than panic and hoof it up to Suarez in the hope he could conjure something up (which he often did of course).

He compared it to City's approach, where they were still passing the ball around in the last few minutes of the game against QPR that they needed to win the league the previous year, and of course, Aguero popped up and stuck it away. </TEXT>

That's the scary part. It WAS a real test, despite Germany not being in top gear!

	<TEXT>  Personally I'm gutted that we had a chance to start fresh because we had loads of decent players coming through from the youth academy, and wasted it. But Ally didn't seem to trust any of them and they've scattered to the four winds of obscure no-mark teams because that's where they're guaranteed a game.

Exactly. Rangers had a chance to create a team from the ground up, with loads of youth players, but instead they signed much older players like Jon Daly etc.

They seemed to have an air of desperation to to get back into the SPL at the first time of asking (through the respective divisions), but obviously didn't have enough faith in their younger players to do that, so signed more experienced ones, but at huge cost.

Would an administration flush out Wallace etc.? Or does it have to be a liquidation for that to happen? </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  And seriously, very few in Sweden can name any players in Celtic. Because they're so mediocre.

If you're going to use the argument that Celtic are mediocre because very few people in your country could name any of our players, then I'm afraid the exact same has to be said of Malmo. How many people in Scotland do you think can name any of the Malmo first team without looking it up on Wikipedia?

I actually agree that the Swedish league is stronger than the Scottish league at the moment, but the fact of the matter is that, in European terms, we're both pretty mediocre, and don't exactly set Europe alight these days, so I doubt many people outside our own countries will know any of our teams players. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Again, this is just my personal viewpoint, but I find being a Celtic fan so frustrating at the moment because of the fixation on European football. Don't get me wrong, I love being involved in the Champions League, but to me, it's not the be-all and end-all. Our team has clearly gotten worse over the past few years, but I'd happily sacrifice Champions League football, if it meant a more competitive league came of it. With Champions League football, we get a minimum of 3 cracking nights at Celtic Park, and very occasionally 4. If the gap in the league closes, as you've spoken about in your post, the league could be on it's way back to the days of the 80s, when teams like Aberdeen and Hearts regularly challenged for the title, something which I'd love to see. I don't mind if we win the league year on year, but only if we don't stroll to it, where's the excitement in that? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, I can't speak for all Celtic fans of course, but I'm not going to lie - I'm still enjoying it to be honest, for no other reason than they're our biggest rivals, and it's always fun to watch your rivals struggle (see the current Liverpool - Manchester United situation). I realise this is the antithesis of being 'classy' - something which doesn't go down too well in this sub it seems, but there you have it - I just see it as part of the rivalry. Rangers fans were giving us absolute pelters after we got shat on in 2 rounds of Champions League qualifying, and when we nearly went to the wall ourselves in 1994, and I wouldn't have it any other way. It's all just give and take IMO.

Yes, it's absolutely shite for their fans, who just want to go and support their team, but have a board full of fuckwits who only seem to be in it to make a quick buck, but like I said, I'm not going to pretend otherwise just because I'm on Reddit! </TEXT>

Despite the name and reputation of Rangers, how much can a team from the Scottish Championship (or whatever division they were in when Ashley bought them) realistically get (or have gotten)?

I'm not being hypothetical here, I'm genuinely wondering if there's any indications.

	<TEXT> Ah, I should have said, I also used marines! Siege tanks to stop the zerg waves, marines to stop Kerrigan. That was enough to complete it on hard, but didn't get the achievements. The most fun thing about that mission for me though, was the fact that I had the hive mind emulator and built loads of them. Any time a brutalisk came near (are they the really big ones, I can't even remember!) I controlled it, killed the smaller zerg with it, then sent it straight up the ramp to the artifact. By the time the end came, where the worms pop up right beside the artifact, I had ten of the bastards, fully healed, just waiting for them :D It was great!

Once I'd completed it, I did it again, with more measured numbers of marines, rather than just pumping them out, along with a small banshee force. That was enough to get rid of the worms outside the base, and I comfortably got the achievements :) </TEXT>

My reply to your 'Alien' comment came before the explanation. In fact, it was your reply that led me to ask for clarification in the thread, the reply to which you've now quoted.

I just go by how much I enjoyed it! I've seen Inception so many times now, it must be in double figures, but I've only seen TKS once, and probably won't watch it again. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, I'm pretty sure that losing 6-3 to most teams would leave me raging, but this felt different. I think it's because, even though we lost, we still took the game to Chelsea, and managed to take 3 goals off them, which is no mean feat, especially when you consider how good their defence is, and the fact that they're the favourites for the title in many people's eyes.

Obviously our defense needs a lot of work, and Howard was dreadful today, but I don't know, this loss didn't leave me feeling that deflated. Chelsea are just an awesome side! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> True, but it would at least give the other teams a better, and fairer, chance to reach the deeper stages at least.

Although what you've said also touches on my second wish - to do away with the group stages altogether!!

I remember when the European Cup was knockout from the start, and I'd love those days to come back. I can understand people's viewpoints of wanting to see the likes of Real Madrid play, and if they were to be knocked out in the first round, there'd be a lot of unhappy people (not least the sponsors). But personally speaking, I'd love that. As I said, I think it's much more sporting to do it this way, but I know that will never happen, as money rules all these days. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> From what I've read, if the share issue fails, Rangers could face administration. I know that this incurs a points deduction, but in terms of the future of the club itself, what are the implications of administration? It's not something I've ever fully understood, no matter who it's happened to. Does administration always lead to liquidation if a club can't get out of it? And if Rangers were to fold, would they be able to re-form again? </TEXT>

	<TEXT>   increasing the likelihood that better and more entertaining teams are knocked out and worse teams slip into the knock-out stages

I really don't understand the objection to this from a sporting perspective. I've said before I'd love to see seedings done away with completely (not just in football) and just let the draw be completely random, but loads of people say to me things like "Yeah great, can you imagine Zenit vs Steaua Bucharest in the CL final?". 

But I don't see what's wrong with that. They're both professional football teams who've won their leagues, thereby earning themselves a place in the Champions League - if they both get lucky with the draws and end up playing in the final, then so be it. Just because they can't field the likes of Ronaldo or Messi, and might not play as attractively as the more famous teams, wouldn't make them any less worthy in my eyes.

I'd much rather an actual league champion from one of the less fashionable leagues won the CL than the team who finished 4th in the PL or La Liga etc. Personally, I'm getting fed up seeing the same teams constantly reaching the quarters etc.

(No offence to Zenit or Steaua fans btw, just the first two teams that popped into my head!).

EDIT: changed a few words. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> EDIT: That title should read European competitions, not matches. Can't change it now :(

Just been having a wee nosy through some of the qualifying draw threads, and was just wondering - do you prefer your team to get drawn against the big guns? Or would you rather they got an easy group? I realise that sounds like a no-brainer, but I think it depends on the team you support.

As a Celtic fan, our chances of winning the Champions League (on the occassions we actually make it there!) have always been zero, so I love it when we get drawn against huge clubs like Barcelona, because the atmosphere on nights like that is always great.

I'm also an Everton fan, and I'm happy to see us get a pretty tough group in the Europa League, again because I think it'll make for some fantastic evenings at Goodison.

But I would imagine teams like Chelsea or Man City, who have aspirations of actually winning it, would much rather have an easier passage through the group stages, to conserve energy for the knockouts.

Just wondered what your views on it are? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> To be honest, of all the replies from Legia fans trying to explain their dislike for Celtic, this is the only one that I've actually understood.

When you say you'd expect your representative to say something, do you mean you'd expect them to offer the place to Celtic? Because I have to say, I personally don't think there's any team on the planet who would offer that, not with what's at stake.

But at least I understand your stance on it now.

	<TEXT> Not strictly true. Legia forfeited the second leg by fielding a player they shouldn't have, which changed the result to a 3-0 win for Celtic. That changed the overall result to a 4-4 draw, putting Celtic through on away goals. 

If Legia had won the first leg 4-0, they would have gone through despite the second leg result being changed. They weren't disqualified outright.

Legia being kicked out the CL had absolutely nothing to do with Celtic, but that didn't stop the endless whining and bitching about it on here from some Legia fans, a lot of which was directed at Celtic, as if we were somehow to blame. Of course, it's the prerogative of Legia fans to come on here and act like arseholes if they want, but don't dish it out and start bleating if someone decides to return the favour. </TEXT>
