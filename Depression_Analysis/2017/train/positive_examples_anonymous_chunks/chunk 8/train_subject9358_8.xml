	<TEXT> I'm leaning towards writing and drawing, I always come back to them. I don't really see the point of doing things I don't enjoy or that frustrate me. I doubt people feel that way very often or they wouldn't keep it up. I've never kept anything I've written or drawn, I always throw it out or delete it, I get that angry at my own work. </TEXT>
