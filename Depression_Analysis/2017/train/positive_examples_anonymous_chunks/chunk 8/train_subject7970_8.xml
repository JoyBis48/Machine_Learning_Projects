	<TEXT> It's scary how mad I can get at myself after doing something stupid. It builds up inside, eventually leading to a phase where I zone out and need pain to get back on my feet. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We run a custom modpack. Sorry, I should've maybe linked [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/feedthebeastservers/comments/304d8c/indeed_custom_1710_pack_hqm_vanilla_mini_games/) reddit post. There's a modlist in the comments. It's a pack designed for low-end computers, I can run it fine on my laptop. I can't access dynmap from where I am now, why isn't it useful? Server is probably empty at the moment, everyone's at work. I agree on the games tab though, haha. We mostly use the forums and Skype to communicate. Have a look at the reddit post, you can apply through the forums :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Now that I think of it, I have seen Kim and Duncan from the yogscast do this in their Flux Buddies series. They used bear traps to contain them or shoved them into 1x1 holes, 2 blocks deep. I'll have a look, thanks again :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah I thought so. Witchery is such a big mod, it's got way more than I expected. There are so many things you can easily miss the first time you play it. I think I might do some lycantropy later, I first wanna get the witchcraft stuff going.

If you ever want to join a server, I can recommend you check out the Indeed community (www.indeedcommunity.com). Ever since I've joined, I've been having fun and made a lot of friends there. We have just opened for applications again. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Wow thanks for the large response! I'll have a look at the Brew of Flowing Spirit, sounds like it's very important. No idea what it does yet but it's probably around on the wiki's and/or in the in-game books.

Yeah it'll have to be a big maze, but I can just design it in creative I think. Should be fun to push a few test subjects.. uuh server members into it. It's a long-term project but I'm known for not finishing long-term projects. I'll see how things will go.

Good to know the others can just go kill stuff. :) Will have a talk with the group to see who's in for some fun hehe. </TEXT>
