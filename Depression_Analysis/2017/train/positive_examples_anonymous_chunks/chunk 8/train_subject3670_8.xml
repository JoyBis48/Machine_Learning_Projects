	<TEXT> I had the same thing (different medication though) where I felt nothing at all and the days were just going by and I didn't feel much, so I dropped the amount I was taking back to what I use to take just so I could feel something but now I feel sad and wouldn't mind feeling nothing at least just for a little bit it doesn't feel like a fun game to play. </TEXT>
