	<TEXT> Jesus. Interesting timing because I am a mercer county native just graduating from college and currently working in a jail, so I was looking at opportunities back in jersey. They said the male officer was monitoring the female alone?? Which isn't a thing at the facility I work at. Even if a male counselor wants to meet with a female there needs to be someone else in the counseling wing  </TEXT>
