	<TEXT> Spanish is pretty straight-forward, German however is terrible since it has 16 different ways to say "the". Also German does NOT have extremely simple grammar. In fact there are a lot of native german speakers who fail to use correct grammer all the time. Deutsche Sprache, schwere Sprache.

However i might need to add that most european languages are indeed easy to learn for native English speakers and vice versa since the languages are closely related. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hearthstone is one of those games where i feel like it's not really worth all the grinding and trouble to hit that legend rank. The only reward is that cardback which looks really meh imo and it doesn't give you enough bragging rights compared to what you can get in games like WoW, LoL and even SC when you put in the time and effort. Everyone who thinks it's worth i wish you best of luck but in the end I've decided against it. Cheers  </TEXT>
