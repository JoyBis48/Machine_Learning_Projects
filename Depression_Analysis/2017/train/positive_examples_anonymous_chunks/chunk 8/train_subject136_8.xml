	<TITLE> Downsides of NoFap?? </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I know we all circle jerk in here about the benefits but what are some of the downsides.

In my experience...

-increased aggression
-Higher chance of making questionable decisions with women

^^ what I mean is that sometimes I fap and it saves me from calling up a chick that I would later regret sleeping with.

	<TEXT> Me too.  I've always thought that nofap was extreme.  But then again I have a high sex drive so if you put a good looking female in front of me I'm going to have no problems getting aroused for her.

I think the people who really need help and need to withdraw a bit are the teens who masturbate like 5 times a day.  That's just crazy.  I might go a few times a week if that. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So do you think it's smart to just buy a laptop with a touchscreen and Windows 8 (assuming the price is the same) then?

I've just heard a lot of bad things about Windows 8... how it was a failure and MS sees it like it saw Vista.  HP's recent announcement that they're going back to Windows 7 on some of their new models had me worried as well.

I'm also hoping these touchscreens aren't a gimmick.  I want my laptop to last a while. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I guess the main thing is that I'm not looking for a touchscreen computer.  Rather than pay extra for that, I'm looking to buy older and upgrade to today's specs. If possible. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We were together for over 5 years and long distance plus trust issues put the nail in the coffin.  Honestly the reasons don't even matter at this point.  I've typed essays about it on the internet before.

I have employed a pretty decent post-breakup strategy over the years.  I hope I didn't give the impression that I'm sulking around everyday depressed about this. lol.  Today was just that random moment where it REALLY gets to me.  It happens about once every two months.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've considered therapy.  How do you go about finding a good one?

We were together for 6 years.  Have had on/off communication over the last two years.  If I knew for a fact reconciliation wasn't a possibility, I would easily get over it.  The problem is that she keeps dangling hope out there.  Like I said, most of the time I'm completely fine.  But today was a down moment. </TEXT>

It was so real, but alas we are not back together.  We haven't even talked in awhile.  I really hate my scumbag brain.

	<TEXT> Thanks for this breakdown.  I think I had a different view of what I perceived to be a sociopath.  Someone who simply isn't driven by the emotions most people feel.  This could lead them to commit crimes or just go about their lives never feeling connected to anybody.

But reading these comments has taught me a lot about both sociopaths (which I agree are not accurately defined) and stoics. </TEXT>

 so·ci·o·path
 ˈsōsēōˌpaTH/
 
 1. a person with a personality disorder manifesting itself in extreme antisocial attitudes and behavior and a lack of conscience.

I could imagine some sociopaths simply not caring about the world around them yet not going out of their way to harm others as well. </TEXT>
