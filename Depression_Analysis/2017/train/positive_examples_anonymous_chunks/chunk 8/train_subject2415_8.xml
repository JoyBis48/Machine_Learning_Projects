	<TEXT> Hey everyone. As one of the few females here, I would just like to remind anyone who reads this that there are ladies out there. I have been called brother, man, and had inquisitions about my penis. I am not a man, nor do I have a penis. It is sweet to call someone your brother, but I am not your brother. Maybe we can somehow include this in the flair? I would really appreciate it...

Anyway, have a good day! </TEXT>

UPDATE:  I'm resetting... I'm not being true to my mission if I cheat myself. This sucks, but I'm doing it. It's not hard mode if I allow myself to take the easy way out.

UPDATE 2: Now I'm undecided... I didn't finish, so why should I, right? Because I still purposely engaged my sexual organs... I don't know, this is a tough decision for me. I think I'm gonna sleep on it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Quick post to remind you guys that **it does get easier**. I remember a time where I just didn't care and gave in thinking I could never do it, and here I am on day seventy and it's never been so easy. It eventually just becomes instilled in you to be clean. Are there temptations? Hell yes, but the difference is you determination in saying no.

Be strong, it is so worth it. Feel free to ask for advice or tips, if you like. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi there,

Today I was talking to my sister (I'm fifteen, she's sixteen), and I brought up my faith hoping to talk about my plan to do natural planning when I get married. She immediately decided to remind me again of why she is agnostic-atheist for a good long while as I sat and listened. I don't think beliefs are a choice, so I didn't want to intervene. She said nothing bad or discriminative, but just talked about being agnostic-atheist. As I sat there I thought, "Is this okay for me to listen to? Should I say something?" I don't really think I should; I think she should practice whatever religion, or lack thereof, she chooses.

What do you think? Thanks. I love you. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I know how this sounds, but I want a boyfriend. I just want someone to talk to, listen to, and make me feel excited around them. I have my friends, but I really just want someone to hold me when I'm down and someone to tell me they love me and/or they're there for me. I want to tell my friends about the cute things he does that make me feel like the only girl in the world. I want to hold his hand when he's having a tough time and make him happy.

Again, I know it sounds petty, but I'm just tired of not having someone in my life that motivates me to keep going. I don't like doing this alone. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, I'm a dancer, so I'm always wearing really tight pants. If I don't wear a thong, you can see the line, and it's pretty embarrassing. Also, after I wore them for awhile, they just made me feel prettier and more presentable. It's kinda like wearing jeans over sweatpants. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think that'd be so cute! But instead, I would say something like, "Hey, check out this picture of my dog/cat/pet rock." I think that'd be a little more subtle. But I understand if it'd be weird to tap phones just to show someone a pic... Either way, good luck(: </TEXT>
