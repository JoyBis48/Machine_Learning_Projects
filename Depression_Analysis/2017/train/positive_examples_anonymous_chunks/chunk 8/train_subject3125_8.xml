	<TITLE> Dean [spoilers season 9] </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-05-18 23:06:17 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I think for the finally deans going to kill himself while taking Metatron with him because he realizes the mark of Cain is too strong and this season kind of emphasized on how dean only saves sam so he's not alone and not just for Sam's well being so I think he will use the last blade to kill Metatron of course then stab himself so he can hurt anyone else in his blind rage and the way he comes back in season 10 is he becomes an angel or Crowley will save him(since he has human emotion now) if only the boys promise not to gank his ass. 


Just a though not saying it's going to happen.


Also share what you think I'm interested to hear about it! </TEXT>

They both go to bed 
 
(Shot of just sams face as he's asleep ) *radio turns on* "it was heat of the moment" Sams eyes open , "RISE AND SHINE SAMMY!" Sam gets up and turns to see lucifer on the other bed as the motel slowly starts to turn into the cage 
*Sam starts to scream* goes to black.
