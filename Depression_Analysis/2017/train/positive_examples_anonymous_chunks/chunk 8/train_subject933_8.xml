	<TEXT> I have realized that it becomes the after effects turn this into a cycle: men are taught to bury their emotions. I did this for years. Later in my life, I met a girl who wanted me to be more open with her so she could connect with me emotionally. The cycle becomes being too open with people who don't deserve it and too guarded with people who want to be there for you.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think one thing to consider is the factor of emotional abuse that is occurring within this situation. 

There is a term called gaslighting in which the abuser tries to control the victim's memory by committing actions and convincing the victim that they never happened. Your brother seems to be doing this and your family seems to be assisting him in this. 

You are seeking validation. You want what happened to be acknowledged and validated; this is only fair. However, if they refuse to validate these things, you can only do two things: stay in the situation or remove yourself from it. The deciding factor will be if the lack of validation will be detrimental to your recovery.

	<TEXT> I used to have similar experiences and I definitely believe this is a part of scrupulosity (religious OCD). One way to counter this is through Exposure Response Prevention therapy. Basically, you need to pray without responding to the intrusive thought. I know how difficult that is though.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The hardest part for me is how society invalidates the emotional abuse of men by refusing to acknowledge it as abuse. No one directly calls this type of behavior as abuse. People will say "oh, she is just crazy". Men will say "oh, my girlfriend freaks out on me". Men are not allowed to say "my girlfriend emotionally abuses me". However, if a man were to exhibit the same behavior, people would easily validate that the woman or SO is being abused. 

There are many reasons for this. Some people believe that men cannot be abused because of some ancient gender expectations. Also, there are some men that will have a difficult time validating the fact that they are being abused. 

I normally don't talk about the abusive relationships I have been involved in because no one will believe me. The hardest part about dealing with this type of pain is when someone invalidates a traumatic experience.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Obviously I'm no medical professional, but your paranoia about the FBI watching you sounds exactly like paranoid schizophrenia. I've also had paranoid fears and I still don't understand the difference between those and schizophrenia.

I know schizophrenia has to do with a loss of touch to reality. From your post, it seems as if there was no logical connection to you having those thoughts; that makes it seem like a loss of touch to reality. However, that's just my observation and I could definitely be wrong.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not proud to say this, but I've been in two. Abuse manifests itself in patterns, therefore, there is always another reason why a person easily accepts abuse. 

I would often make excuses for her behavior (e.g. she is just having a bad day, I made her upset, she had a rough childhood). However, none of these things are acceptable excuses for abusive behavior. 

The sad part about this is that he has to realize the abuse in his own mind. Once he acknowledges the abusive behavior, then he will begin to do something. The enlightenment is the hardest part.
