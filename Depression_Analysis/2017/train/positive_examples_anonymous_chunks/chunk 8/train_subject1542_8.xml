	<TEXT> I used to be really into the "hip" christians. Jefferson Bethke, Chris Quilala, Mark Driscoll even. Now I look at them and I still think they are genuinely good people. I can't help but think like, man, these people have convinced themselves of such deep religious fanaticism and even made it a cool/hip thing.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> hey its really great that you're trying to get in better shape, but what exactly do you mean by "fit by that deadline" do you mean losing a certain amount of lbs? running a mile in a certain amount of time? dont look for a quick fix. think about it this way. you're undoing 21 years of unhealthy living, so it's not going to happen in just 3 months. 

id say start with running a mile everyday. or if thats too much 1/2 mile. and for food, you dont have to micromanage, but learn about the caloric contents of your food (how many calories, how many grams of fat, carbs, proteins) eat more vegetables, clean lean meats (if your not vegetarian), healthy fats from nuts, avocado or fish, and avoid processed sugar/ refined carbs.

that should be plenty to get started </TEXT>
