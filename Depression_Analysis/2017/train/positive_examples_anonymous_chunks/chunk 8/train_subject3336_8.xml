	<TEXT> I'm so sorry you are suffering this way :( I have anxiety but mildly in comparison to what I used to have. Best thing I ever did was find a good councillor and find out WHY I was depressed and anxious. Knowing why stopped the self harming and the destructive behaviour as a result of learning to love myself. Sending strength and love x </TEXT>
