	<TEXT> Okay so here is my theory, picking up what people have said about the Institute, Black Row, The REV ALPHA code, and everything else I have picked up. Just my speculation and theory btw.

EHEHEMM...
Vault 119, one of the few Vaults built in the Northeast, is inhabited by people who haven't seen the surface in almost 225 years. Generations have been born and generations have died, all the while the inhabitants keep living on, ignorant of the outside world. They go about they're daily business their Vault, just south of Boston, waiting for the door that has kept them safe for so many years to open. Their Vault, made by Vault-Tec before the Great War, wasn't meant to open until 300 years after it closed. Unless something goes terribly wrong.
             It's a normal Monday morning, and the Survivor is wading through his daily routine of classes, then workout, eat, sleep, repeat. He walks past the tunnel leading to the door and hears some heavy thudding. Of course very curious, he walks towards the door. As he gets closer, he can also hear a voice on the other side. Someone was calling help, and from the sounds of it, they weren't strong. As The Survivor turned to run from the door to get help, he hear a louder thud, then what sounded like laughter. He ran off, too scared to mention what happened. A week passes and this time as he is waking up, all the alarms in the Vault start going off. The Overseer starts sounding off a message through the intercom.
      Something wasn't right. All the statuses were checked green that day. No critical systems were failing, no reactor was blowing up. Something bad was about to happen. Just then there is a loud explosion and a fury of gunshots as a large band of raiders charge into the Vault. They kill everyone. Save the Survivor. They hide under the body of a raider they killed until the rest calmed down. Then he escaped. S/He is amazed both by how beautiful, and horrific, the landscape is. He finds the body of the man that was banging on the door the previous week, and disposes of the corpse, keeping the 10mm pistol and Leather Armor however.
From there, it's storyline. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree on the point of Halo 2   3 being better than (almost) any CoD game. Halo 2, even being almost 10 years old, still has a humongous fanbase still playing. Even I am included in that fanbase:) Halo 3 was one of the biggest multiplayer games when it came out. Although it's population dwindled at times, when it became free, It's population reached the same numbers it would have had in the first month. I truly love the series and I see alot of opposition writing it but I believe that Halo, overall, is the better game.

	<TEXT> Hey guys, train_subject896 here! So, like many of the other active duty Spartan's on here, I am back into the grind of school and have been since August. I currently am enrolled in a public speaking class. My final is a persuasive speech that has to last 5 minutes. Being the diehard fan I am, I chose to beg the question, "Why Halo is better than Call of Duty" as my topic.
Now, here is where I need your help /r/Halo.

**Why is Halo better than Call of Duty to YOU?**

Now, before you all get fussy, I am a fan of all games, including the occasional game against bots on COD. I respect it as a game, considering the titan it is, and expect you to have some form of etiquette rather than answers like "cuz cod iz 4 fagts 420 sweg". Please be level headed and source your info!

Thanks all! See you on the battlefield!:) </TEXT>
