	<TEXT> I got an X100 for this purpose (now have an XT-1 plus 27mm pancake lens). I carry it everywhere in my purse.

I shoot documentary, lifestyle, street, "every day" life type of stuff so I don't find it hard to fit it into my life at all. I also love road trips and I'm all over the place in the summer, so of course I take my camera with me.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I feel that way about the 27 - perfect for me as far as not having to move when I put the camera up to my face. I wish it was at least a 1.4, 1.8 or even 2 though.

They are coming out with a 35 f/2, maybe they will one day do the same for the 23... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have the XT-1, 18-55, 35 and 27 and am thinking about picking up the 23. I shoot at 23 a lot on the zoom, and the 27 is close enough and a great lens, but it's not a 1.4. I'm just wondering if I'll even use my 35 if I get the 23... it's such an awesome lens, but not as versatile. I find it a tad too tight in some situations. I could pop the 27 on there but I shoot at night a lot and 2.8 won't cut it.

I do use an adapted Sigma 24mm but it's a 2.8 and flares/loses contrast like crazy in strong light. 

I wonder sometimes if I should just skip the 23 1.4 and get the new 16mm 1.4 that's coming out... seems like a better complement to the 35, but I don't really shoot that wide. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Totally agree.

I love dogs. I fucking HATE dog owners. And yeah, Richmond is definitely the worst in my experience. I live near Bryan Park and can't take my dog there because of all the assholes with off-leash dogs. My dog has been attacked in the past and does NOT react well to off-leash dogs. Through no fault of ours now we can't go to any parks because I don't know how she is going to react. Granted, I won't be liable if she flips shit on an off-leash dog, but I hate dog fights and I don't want to deal with that, or her getting hurt. 

I hate dog owners. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Or other people could just control their dogs and put them on a leash, so leash aggression doesn't become an issue with off-leash dogs.

My dog is leash aggressive. It actually is very normal. Leashes really screw up normal dog-greeting behaviors. Not to mention they are leashed and can't get away. Imagine if you had a collar around your neck and a leash and a fellow human rushed up to you suddenly, out of nowhere, someone you didn't know. More than likely you are going to instantly be on the defensive. Hell WITHOUT a collar/leash, someone does that shit to me, they are probably getting punched. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> self-portraits in the age of selfies and narcissistic attention wh*redom </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-04-30 19:35:32 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Last year I started a self-portrait project. The whole point of it was to focus on my "imperfections" that I once hated and accept now that I'm in my 30's. Pointing out my flaws that make me unique - as opposed to the millions of selfies that are posted everyday where people only show their best side. 

I've recently decided I want to learn how to use my flash off-camera finally, so I invested in some basic equipment. I live alone, no kids, so for the time being, my only test subject is me. So I'm coming up with more self-portrait ideas to figure out this whole lighting business. 

I post these on my Flickr, Tumblr, and Facebook just like any other work I do. But I start to wonder if I'm just perpetuating the whole culture of narcissism that I hate. I'm a decent looking woman, not a model by any stretch but I can take a good photo of myself. I would hate to think that people might assume I'm just taking "selfies" because I'm obsessed with my looks... like I assume about most #selfies on Instagram or wherever.

I envy Vivian Maier...  </TEXT>

" half the time I feel like a slimy creep, who's goal is just to ogle attractive women through the lens."

I'm confused by this comment. Are you saying that you think people think this about YOU, or that YOU think this about yourself? 

There are a LOT of perverted guys out there who use cameras as an excuse to look at hot women naked. Just check out the Model Mayhem site. Assuming you are actually not one of these people, just act in a professional manner. </TEXT>
