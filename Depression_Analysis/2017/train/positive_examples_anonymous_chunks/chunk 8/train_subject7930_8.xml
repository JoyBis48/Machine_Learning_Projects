	<TEXT> Sure. I just cut out a stencil in freezer paper, ironed it to a shirt, and then sprayed it over with a 50-50 mix of bleach and water. There are tutorials online and I can also send you the stencil I made if you want.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Probably not because I don't want my ass sued to oblivion and back, but if there's any interest I can post up the stencil that I made once I get back to my computer if anyone is interested in making their own.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I started playing about a month or so ago. I'm level 22 and mostly playing normals (still learning a bit). Just looking for some more players to possibly invite to games with my friends who are mostly 30's. (: We have skype. I mostly play either Irelia or Sejuani right now.

	<TEXT> I am also a college senior about to enter my second semester. I can't say that I know exactly the best method to deal with this since I'm also going through the same fears, but I've been going to therapy for the past several months and it has certainly helped me a lot. This next semester, my therapist will be signing me up for group therapy sessions for social anxiety. I would suggest doing the sames -- many universities will have free therapy for students or similar programs for help. Best of luck. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I personally really dig earrings on guys. Studs especially. I just really like the look, especially on Asian guys. :b It really depends on the guy, but I've found that most Asian guys have been able to rock this look. </TEXT>
