	<TEXT> True for my location. When I worked overnights at Walmart, everyone was on something at some point in the night, and they gave you an hour lunch break. For me, this became a routine: smoke a bowl, eat lunch, smoke another bowl, smoke a cig, febreeze clothes (I don't like smelling like weed in public, even if it is Walmart) and return to my monotonous job </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Mr. Sanders,

Thank you for taking the time out of your day to read over and answer some of our questions. I would almost consider this AMA a more modernized, albeit, less face to face, version of a town hall meeting. 
    
With that in mind, I am wondering what other communication styles you had planned, what with trying to get a forward thinking campaign moving under a third party banner. Do you feel that there are extra obstacles to be cleared because of your status as a third party candidate, and how do you plan on handling said obstacles? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As the title goes, I thought I found a girl who I would have been dating, but I found her apparent deal-breaker: she thinks it's the worst thing ever to smoke pot, yet she tried to claim that she supports medical marijuana.     

I then explained the differences in weed in illegal states, adding that we can't have dispensaries around, so it is difficult to find low THC, high CBD strains in decent quantity or frequency.     

She then sent me a message telling me her last boyfriend apparently lied to her about smoking. My thought is that if I'm honest with it, it won't be an issue.   

 Edit: I've seen all of the honesty related comments. I don't lie to people I care about.

The issue might be (if you look into my post history) I like drug use. So I might just be marking another girl off the already short "girls who are interested in me" list. Yes this is whiny. No, I don't really care right now.

I wanted to hear the subs thoughts.

Bonus: I forgot I asked her to watch The Culture High a couple months back, which she followed through on. So, I guess I made a little progress.. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hahaha the first time I got caught was the first time I saw a phone go through a TV. She ordered a new one and apologized the next day for her reaction. I was on Christmas break and decided to smoke some with a couple friends. My mom thought it was because of the people I was hanging out with. It was quite the opposite: I liked to smoke and I had the money, so I bought the weed and was repaid in gas, munchies, and ways to pass the time. I also sold to another group in very small amounts (my biggest sale in high school was a quad) and was making my own decisions and such.

Today, my parents know that I smoke; but I haven't tried to show them the reasoning. They refuse to talk about it. Remember, a phone went through a TV. They don't call me out on it or cause trouble because I look and act like a functioning young adult, unlike my brother.  I work, I go to school, and I have ambition. 

My dad has told me several times about how he has been around people who smoked but never smoked with them. He said he isn't a fan of the smell, but I once saw his face light up in happiness over my mom picking up lunchmeat. His eyes were bright red and he had "the grin" so I'm convinced he has smoked before, and still might on the down low. I've smoked with a few of his close friends, so I know they're not too worried about it.

My mom is the opposite. She has never done a drug in her life recreationally (she keeps her Vyvanse locked in her cabinet and takes only the prescribed amount) except for cigarettes and caffeine, if you want to get anal about it. She is an ER nurse, and with that,  I understand why she is against drug use in general. She sees the worst outlooks on a daily basis: ODs, kids (15-19) losing out on a long life, just the generally crippling effects of being lost to an uncontrollable addiction. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Part 1.   

So at about 9 pm last night, I took a tab of acid, and let it do its work. The visuals weren't too intense but the feel goods and body vibes were beautiful. This lasted from roughly 10-1. I decided to have a smoke sesh, which created part 2 of the trip.    

Part 2.   

After this; I went into full trip mode, and laid in my backyard for 2 hours. It was dark, but the full moon made it look like it was daylight. Everything looked like it was a twilight time of day, and there was so much depth to the horizon. I could see designs and figures in the clouds. Weird enough, I saw 3 demonic faces staring into the moon, and I stared into it all. Once I could move, I entered one of the most intense and euphoric meditative trances in my life. I sat and I contemplated as much as I could, but I can only recall pieces at this time. I wound up falling asleep at sometime when my mind finally decided to give up from overload.

Rating.  

Part 1: ++ (I could still hold a full conversation with my mother)   

Part 2: +++ (I will not assign one of my own experiences as a ++++, but this is the closest I feel I have ever been to it) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Mankind is made of the same building blocks as everything else we have discovered in our short history. Just a few basic molecules make up over 90% of the universe, yet there is so much diversity and beauty in our world. Life has found a place to flourish, amongst the rubble left from The Big Bang, and the results of the collisions of parts of said rubble. We are one planet, one pint sized, yet massive, grouping of molecular structures that has come together to create a collective life force…a drive, perhaps, to “advance” and “evolve” as numerous and diverse of species possible. It seems reasonable that there would be at least one other place in the universe that has this same capacity, and it utilizing it far better than any species on Earth would be able to compromise. We live in a universe that we have mapped a very small percentage of, said universe is constantly expanding, and we have already found at least one other collection of debris that has the possibility of being able to house some form of life. Scientists discovered that Mars used to have oceans, and that these oceans were found frozen under the surface of Mars itself. By extension, would it be fair to reason that Mars could have possibly housed lives before we as a species ever gained the collective power to be able to observe events that are beyond our planetary scale?
    
This understanding has helped me figure out some of the Nirvana and oneness that I felt during my last acid trip. I didn’t think of it the way I had typed it there during my trip, though. During, I felt myself sink into the ground, and fall into the Earth. When I had laid back down on my blanket, I felt myself floating up into the stars, and becoming the Hubble Space Telescope, in that every image I saw was clear, beautiful, mystifying, and vivid, yet I could process this through a computer so powerful and perplexingly fast that nothing man has done thus far has even come close to the processing speed and mind blowing capabilities of said computer. I’m talking about the human brain, of course.

	<TEXT> Mankind is made of the same building blocks as everything else we have discovered in our short history. Just a few basic molecules make up over 90% of the universe, yet there is so much diversity and beauty in our world. Life has found a place to flourish, amongst the rubble left from The Big Bang, and the results of the collisions of parts of said rubble. We are one planet, one pint sized, yet massive, grouping of molecular structures that has come together to create a collective life force…a drive, perhaps, to “advance” and “evolve” as numerous and diverse of species possible. It seems reasonable that there would be at least one other place in the universe that has this same capacity, and it utilizing it far better than any species on Earth would be able to compromise. We live in a universe that we have mapped a very small percentage of, said universe is constantly expanding, and we have already found at least one other collection of debris that has the possibility of being able  to house some form of life. Scientists discovered that Mars used to have oceans, and that these oceans were found frozen under the surface of Mars itself. By extension, would it be fair to reason that Mars could have possibly housed lives before we as a species ever gained the collective power to be able to observe events that are beyond our planetary scale?

This understanding has helped me figure out some of the Nirvana and oneness that I felt during my last acid trip. I didn’t think of it the way I had typed it there during my trip, though. During, I felt myself sink into the ground, and fall into the Earth. When I had laid back down on my blanket, I felt myself floating up into the stars, and becoming the Hubble Space Telescope, in that every image I saw was clear, beautiful, mystifying, and vivid, yet I could process this through a computer so powerful and perplexingly fast that nothing man has done thus far has even come close to the processing speed and mind blowing capabilities of said computer.

	<TEXT> A friend of mine and I decided to make a tray of brownies and started cooking our weed. Everything was going great until we both left the kitchen, and wouldn't you know it, goddamn grease fire. I haven't seen the damage to the place yet, but he is currently in the ER with burns and such. 

If you're going to use vegetable oil or anything of the sort, be very observant and never leave it unattended.

Update: He has 3rd degree burns along his right wrist and right foot. Also; he is dealing with the pain like a champ. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Okay so I binged. I had 3/4 of an ounce of weed, a 750ml of Captain Morgan, 10 xanax, and some morphine. I smoked a few bong bowls, then took 4 MG of Xanax.

I now have an entire weekend at Muncie Gras that I have no memory of, all my xanax is gone, there's some kief in my bag, morphine is also gone and so is my memory for the last 2 days. Wow.

And I had to get my car out of impound. 

Edit: wound up being about 12 or 15 bars missing. What the fuck?

	<TEXT> I have an undisclosed amount of money that was recently added to my bank account and about 3 days of down time before my new job starts. 

So, spending money is present, and time to recover is also present?

What should I binge on this weekend?

Edit: I have all my weed already purchased. I have about $400 I can spend. For the feeling, I want something where I can be social, and hyped up. Like I'm on top of the world without too much comedown. I don't need to feel lovey. 

Things I can get for sure: Xanax, various opiates (not touching H, personal preference) more weed, MDMA, shrooms, LSD, 25X series, Cocaine, Meth.

Anything else I should ask about? </TEXT>
