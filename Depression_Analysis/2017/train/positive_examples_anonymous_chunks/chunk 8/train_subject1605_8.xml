There's always just a lot going on. 

And yes, I've tried other thinks like you've suggested.

	<TEXT> You think election season ends? 

Shit's important yo. Would you base a relationship that lasts 4 years and has major impact on your life without trying to get to know the person? 

Plus there's only like 5 elections a decade. It isn't really that hard to stay informed. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Its a warp field created by bending spacetime. Think of it like the Concorde program. They would have to get out over sea to avoid the sonic boom from breaking windows. And I said given the speed of light. I didn't exclude going faster. 

I'm thinking logistics wise, not unbridled idealism. </TEXT>

Plus you'd probably not want to bend spacetime anywhere near other people because you have no idea what effect that can have. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What's more helpful to the general populous? 

Here's a thought. 

EDUCATE THEM. If the general population is so scientifically illiterate it is literally killing them, perhaps we should focus on educating our children instead of teaching them even shittier non-science. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  you don't necessarily realize the amount of sodium, sweeteners, etc.... that go into it. 

Stick to the serving size and you should be fine. Of course you shouldn't eat 2000 calories of beef jerky because that's like 10x the amount of sodium you should have. 

Processed food is fine as long as you don't eat too much. I.E. More than 2000 calories a day. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In general, typically...? I would hold their weight the same. 

People think refined foods are worse because it is easier to over indulge. Refined sugar is no more dangerous *in the appropriate amount* than say pure cane or beet sugar. Adding stabilizers and preservatives does not decrease the healthy-ness of food. Sure it can make the quality crap. It'll taste different, but it is not one the whole more or less healthy than, say, organic alternatives. </TEXT>

If someone wants to say that you shouldn't things that you can't pronounce, I'm going to poke the hole in that seriously flawed logic. Saying things are bad because you don't understand them is pretty much the same thing as xenophobia. </TEXT>
