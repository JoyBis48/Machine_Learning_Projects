	<TEXT> Reasons for risking life and limb varied, but they usually came down to four fundamentals: uphold state sovereignty, regional duty, group solidarity and protection of home and family.

Except their constitution made it illegal to ban slavery in any state, so there goes state sovereignty, regional duty, etc. Say one day Alabama decides they don't want slavery anymore. Too bad, they can't ban it. Where's state's rights now?

The notion that the average Confederate waged war to preserve slavery is a tenuous one at best. Only 6 percent of Southerners owned slaves, and 3 percent of those owned the majority. Recruits themselves referred to the war as "a rich man's war and a poor man's fight."

Data from the 1860 census shows us that 47% of the entire lower south, and 29% of the upper south consisted of slaves. That's a lot of people. One third of southern households owned at least one slave. Mississippi and South Carolina boasted bigger numbers. It was almost 1/2 of households there. 

I think the "rich man's war and poor man's fight" comes from the fact that it was the rich that made their living on slavery. Your average household just had a slave or two to do daily chores. Households would just have to do their own housework if slavery was lost, but rich plantations would lose their entire way of life. And of course, the rich could pay for someone to fight for him. A poor man could not. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It was probably from the 1860 consensus. It was very common for households to have a few slaves.

It was mostly the rich though that had owned the plantations and hundreds/thousands of slaves to make their fortune. That's where the rich/poor divide comes from.

The Confederate Constitution also made it illegal for states to outlaw slavery. So much for state sovereignty.  </TEXT>

I think you are allowed to say this. You just aren't allowed to say you're going to hang him or say someone else should hang him.

But since you think we should be allowed to say whatever we want, what should happen if someone knowingly accuses an innocent man of molesting a child, and an angry mob kills said man? Should the one who knowingly falsely accused him be punished? If so, that goes against your free speech ideals. That's slander. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You made a claim with nothing to back it up. How do you know "well regulated" doesn't actually mean regulated in a government document, but "well-maintained"?

In fact, the word "regulate" comes from the Latin *regulatus*, which means "to control by rule." 

It's been known to mean "to govern by restriction" since the early 1600s.

	<TEXT> The original documents of the Confederacy show they were going to war for slavery, not because they thought the federal government was over-reaching.

Our position is thoroughly identified with the institution of slavery — the greatest material interest of the world … a blow at slavery is a blow at commerce and civilization." -Mississippi

"In the State of New York even the right of transit for a slave has been denied by her tribunals..." South Carolina (talking about how owners weren't permitted to bring their slaves with them into New York)

"We hold as undeniable truths that the governments of the various States, and of the confederacy itself, were established exclusively by the white race, for themselves and their posterity; that the African race had no agency in their establishment; that they were rightfully held and regarded as an inferior and dependent race, and in that condition only could their existence in this country be rendered beneficial or tolerable." -Texas

	<TITLE> So, I got my last wisdom tooth removed Friday. Let me tell you about the time I got the others removed. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-07-05 19:15:37 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> When I was around 19, my wisdom teeth began coming in. They hurt, but that's normal. Except it became obvious after awhile they were impacted. I read online that if they're painful for more than 6 months, they're likely impacted and it's time to have them removed.

When I told my mom this, she rolled her eyes and said, "They'll come in. Believe me, your mouth is big enough." That's right. She thought the fact that I was mouthy had anything to do with whether or not there was room for my wisdom teeth.

Well, I knew they were impacted, but I was still in high school at this point and didn't work, so it wasn't like I could pay to have them taken out. Two years passed. I had various infections where my teeth were trying to come in and lots of swelling, but they always went away at some point and I was still having trouble finding a job, so I just left them there. I tried to tell my mom how much trouble they were causing me, but she kept saying wisdom teeth are painful and she wasn't paying to have them removed when "nothing was wrong."

Well, one day three of them got infected at once. The pain was so intense that I couldn't so much as move my tongue without pain radiating from my teeth to my ears to my throat. I drooled into a towel instead of swallowing my saliva. It's to this day the worst pain I've ever felt.

At this time my dad took me to the dentist, FINALLY. Mom was still insisting this was normal, BTW. The dentist was shocked to see how long we let the problem go without seeing anyone about it. The removal was painful as hell (they couldn't get the infection to go away before operating, so they had to do it while my gums were inflamed). 

The dentist said my last remaining wisdom tooth wasn't impacted and it would come in. He turned out to be wrong, but at least I had 3 of the 4 removed.

Who doesn't mind seeing their kid in extreme pain to save on dentist bills? That's my mother! </TEXT>
