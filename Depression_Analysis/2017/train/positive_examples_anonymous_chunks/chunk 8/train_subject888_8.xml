	<TEXT> I’m not having issues with the crashing of the control center tray, but on tray pull-up there is some lag and dropping of frames, which is annoying. So I suppose that I hope for the continued smoothing-out of interface elements as well as the continued improvement of battery life, wi-fi issues (for those who have them), and of course the addition of Apple Music. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I never said I believe her every word, just that she does her homework and is a pretty swell analyzer. She seems intelligent and open-minded to me, so while I may not end up siding with her on everything, we still share a similar (and in my opinion healthy) distrust of government and mass media. Her striking analysis of Family Guy's "prediction" of Robin Williams' death is what really got to me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, there are occurrences of what some have termed "predictive programming," which just a term for conditioning/priming the mass conscience using media laced with subconscious "clues" which are, as some believe, the Elite's way of "warning" the public of catastrophic events. A good example of such a phenomenon is Family Guy, a show perfect for subconscious brainwashing due to its off-the-wall, seemingly "random" nature, correctly "predicting" some major occurrences, such as the Boston Marathon bombings and Bruce Jenner's transition into Caitlyn. Saturday Night Live has also supposedly been used to push secret agendas (including that of the 9/11 attacks) before they had come to full fruition. If anyone else has more info/examples, I'd certainly appreciate it.
