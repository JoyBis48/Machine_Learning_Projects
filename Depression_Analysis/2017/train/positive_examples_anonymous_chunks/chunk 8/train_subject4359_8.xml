	<TEXT> Another Zoidberg fan here! I really like Billy West's choice of voice for Zoidberg. Even very mundane lines can sound very funny. I remember laughing hysterically in that parallel universe episode when one of the Zoidbergs said "The box says no" when asked to give it to the other Zoidberg.

But as in cases with most fictional characters, I may find him to be incredibly annoying in real life. Also quite scary given his lobster-like apperance :p </TEXT>

But really, you can't go tell a cancer patient "change your attitude about things and your cancer will go away".

And anger, though unhealthy in large doses, can be evidence of better things. For instance you have a goal and motivation to achieve it so you are frustrated by slow progress. But hang in there, and try to keep it up. And don't beat yourself up too hard. Leave that to the strangers on the internet. </TEXT>

It's meaningless to think about how meaningless life is. So I began to do something else. Watch movies. Go shopping. Do homework (I was in univ at the time). Sleep. I occupied my mind with other stuff and I became less fixated on the meaninglessness of my life. </TEXT>

 I can definitely relate to the Minas Tirith scene. I love the Khazad Dum and Helms Deep scenes as well, but the battle at Minas Tirith had extra desperation to the atmosphere because Frodo was there. (I hope I'm remembering this correctly; been a while since I read the books / watched the movies.) Much more at stake, and we had Faramir who didn't entirely trust Frodo and Sam. So yeah, I can definitely see why it made you think of Minas Tirith. </TEXT>

He spent most of his time working when I was little and I had little time to get to know him. He was always the Patriarch, Mr. Big-shot at his office, that I respected and feared at the same time. Now that he's retired he gets really hissy when he wants to assert his dominance. His chauvinism annoys me but also makes me sad to see him desperately cling onto his faded glory.

Curious a photograph of a lion and his cubs should bring complicated emotions... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Agree completely. He's someone I'd find obnoxious and extremely rude in real life (like many fictional characters) but is hilarious on screen. I also don't like how they casually wrote him off saying he left the country with the girl who had a baby for another job or something. </TEXT>

The funny thing is though, it wasn't like he was flaming people for allegedly costing him a game like usual trolls do. It's a freakin' friends request to a stranger he's never met... Goddamn. This kid has real issues. I'm even more embarrassed by the fact that he's from my province :( </TEXT>
