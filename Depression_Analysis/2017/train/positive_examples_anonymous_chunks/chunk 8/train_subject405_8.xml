	<TEXT> I've told my coworkers and no ones ever judged me. What other people think doesn't matter. Its what you know matters. The people who matter will care and understand and the ones who don't care it will show. I see it as a gift  because it is weeding out the people that don't matter. But it is also something we have to live with. Life is about learning from our mistakes and moving on. Addiction has shown me that I can live a normal sane life without drugs or alcohol or gambling and I take it as a gift and a learning point. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi there thanks for reaching out that is definitely taking the right step. I used drugs for about 8 years and finally came to a point where I had to stop. Your at a point where you seem like you want to end it. I would suggest trying out a local AA or NA meeting and linking with sober people. You need sober support and if you want you can Pm and I will recommend a few books. Your still addicted you need to acknowledge and move forward with recovery and you will feel much happier. 

Whats kept me sober is cutting out people I would get high with completely. Reaching out to sober people when I needed help. Reading books. Reminding myself that I should be grateful because life could be 100x worse if I never stopped. Helping others with addiction, connecting with people. Not being self centered. Which has always been hard for me. </TEXT>
