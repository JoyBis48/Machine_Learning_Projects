	<TITLE> Why does my kitty run away from me sometimes when I try to pet her? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-01-05 04:24:17 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I've had her for about 6 months (she belonged to my ex-roommate and/or his mom for a couple of years), and sometimes when I bend down to pet her, she runs and hides (and sometimes she doesn't and just lets me pet her).

She likes to snuggle next to me when we both sleep at night, and she climbs on top of me when she wants affection.

I do know that she doesn't like to be picked up though, but sometimes I have to. She'll thrash around and make noise when I pick her up, and I'm not sure if I'm hurting her or she just doesn't like it.

Other than that, I never hurt her on purpose (not even as punishment for doing something bad like I know some pet owners do), I make sure her litter box is clean, I feed her and give her water (and even share my own food with her sometimes), and like I said, I let her sleep next to me even though she has her own bed and it restricts my movement when she's in the bed with me.

Is me picking her up sometimes the reason she runs away from me sometimes? </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  How exactly does it affect you?

 What's so weird about it?

I don't know, it just feels... different. I guess because I'm used to seeing the character take one step after another when I move them, instead of floating. Maybe they feel lighter than characters who walk.

I also noticed that with Zod, the way he walks makes him feel heavier when I use him, which also feels weird to me.

Like I said, it might be something I could get used to, and tbh, I do appreciate the fact that different characters all have different stances, even to the extent that some don't even touch the ground (although it might be cool if you could choose to float or walk as Superman or something, since he doesn't levitate everywhere in the comics/films). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In *Injustice*, Superman, Green Lantern, and I think a couple of other characters don't stand-- they float roughly two inches off the ground and glide when you move.

Is it me, or does that just feel extremely weird? Is it something one can eventually get used to? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Something I just thought of regarding Hobbes' nature: Calvin's knowledge of animals that aren't dinosaurs. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-01-03 23:48:16 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> In [one strip](http://assets.amuniversal.com/07d60d60df8e01317256005056a9545d) Calvin claims that Hobbes cleans himself by licking his fur, which is very true about most, if not all cats.

Now, Calvin is obsessed with dinosaurs and has amazingly thorough knowledge of them, but he never exhibits real interest in any other animals (except [snakes in one strip](http://assets.amuniversal.com/ebd6bec0784d01302116001dd8b71c47), and [wasps/spiders in another](http://assets.amuniversal.com/d295bca0deca013171a6005056a9545d)). We also know [Calvin hates school because "[We] don't read about dinosaurs."](http://assets.amuniversal.com/541c1540decb013171a6005056a9545d)

So how would Calvin know that cats lick themselves clean unless he's *really* seen Hobbes do it? And if Hobbes isn't real, how does Calvin know about all the other true cat/tiger habits that he imagines Hobbes having? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't think Pascal's Wager quite fits here. That's simply believing in something because you fear the consequences of not doing so as well as the lack of benefits of not believing. That'd be kind the equivalent of someone reading this thread, saying "Oh crap, it would fuckin SUCK to go to Hell," and converting to Christianity.

I assume most Atheists have more pride and strength of belief than to do something like that. I'm asking those people, who will stick to their belief that NO deity exists, if they've ever thought about being wrong.

Sort of like asking someone who's a police officer, and a very good one, "Do you ever fear getting gunned down by an armed criminal?" They're not going to quit the force just because that's a possibility, but the concern can still be there. </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2014-12-28 01:34:01 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I work from home, and I don't sleep well for the most part (I have insomnia and completely rely on sleep aids, and they tend not to give you a good night's rest, which results in fatigue a few hours after waking up), so at some point during the day, I usually get a little tired and have the urge to just crawl into bed and finish my work later (which I could do, but staying awake and doing it right then would be better).

Any advice? Even when I go sit at the kitchen table to get away from my bed, and hopefully the urge to lay down, I still feel the urge to put my head down and just fall asleep. It's very inconvenient.

By the way, I have talked to my physician about this. She recommended that I attempt to provide my body with a consistent circadian rhythm, which I'm working on. But for now, I figured I'd look for a short-term solution while I do so.

Thanks. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm trying to watch videos on NBA.com, and the way certain videos work is that you click a link, and a little mini-window will pop up where you can watch the video(s) you selected. If you click [this link](http://on.nba.com/1AaNcJZ), I believe it should show you exactly what I just described.

When I do that, and the video tries to load, it never does, and I just get a blank screen (but I can hear the audio). But if I right-click on one of the thumbnails of the videos on the right side of the mini-window, and select "Open in new tab/window," I can see the video just fine.

It's a minor inconvenience, but does anyone know what the issue might be? I've tested this in the other internet browsers I have, too, and it's only Firefox that has this problem. </TEXT>

She also told me a story about how one of her friend's sons was smoking marijuana with a group of guys, and it was laced with crystal meth or something or another, which has absolutely nothing to do with my situation. That's an instance of smoking with people you don't know and/or who aren't trustworthy. No relation at all to me drinking a half a bottle of alcopop every other day or so.

I'm drinking *Smirnoff Ice*. It barely even qualifies as an alcoholic beverage. It's almost glorified soda. </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2014-12-25 13:00:28 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Both have the potential for addiction/dependency, as well as tolerance, and can be incredibly dangerous if taken in large doses. However, if taken in moderation, neither of them is very self-threatening. In the case of alcohol, it's also legal (for those of at least minimum drinking age), just like morphine and other opioids or benzodiazepines.

The only difference I can see is that one requires a prescription and the other does not.

The reason I ask is because I, at *25 years old*, living on my own, told my dad and my step-mother that I've been drinking a little bit on a recent car trip, and they treated me like I was some sort of stupid, hopeless alcoholic. And they didn't believe me when I said my physician, seeing as she considers me intelligent and responsible, told me that drinking in moderation would be fine.

On top of that, all I drink is alcopops (Smirnoff Ice, which is like 4.5% ABV-- that's approximately 9 proof, which is incredibly low for an alcoholic beverage), and I hardly ever drink even a half a bottle (750mL) in one sitting, and I *never* drink more than once a day.

I don't get it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Some girl from halfway across the country sent me a friend request, because she was "looking threw (not a typo on my end) facebook and found my profile and fell in love with my eyes."

I'm not taking her seriously at all-- I'm just waiting for her to do or say something that will 100% confirm that she's a bot or a scammer. She actually sent me a couple voice messages on Facebook and we've talked on the phone. Her voice sounded almost exactly the same in each context. I gave her my cell phone number (it's not a smart phone; there's no information about me on it).

Regardless, here's a list of things she's done/hasn't done that makes me way beyond skeptical:

* Told me her first name was one thing, but her first name is listed as another on her info page
* Claims she works with kids, mainly in the "activity area"... but she tells me she doesn't get off of work until midnight at the earliest and 3 AM at the latest. What could she possibly be doing that involves kids at anywhere near that time of night?
* Posted a status about how her friend was at her house at 10:45 or so the other day, even though she told me she was at work

And, like I said in the title, whether via cell or Facebook, she has not once sent the first message of a conversation in all of at least 7 or 8 conversations, despite all the "OMG I like you so much, you're so cute, I'll text you in the morning," etc (all of which I roll my eyes at). It's like I have to "activate" her by sending a message.

Is that an issue with bots? Also, what else should I look for? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It is, but it would be up to the user as to whether or not he wants to deviate from the character's established outfit. Ken and Ryu have arguably the most well-known outfits in fighting game history (gi with no footwear), but if someone wants to change that and give them, say, a more ninja-esque costume (yes, I know they're not ninja) because they think it looks cool, no harm, right?

Also, a lot of really iconic characters don't have truly distinct outfits. Scorpion and Sub-Zero's costumes change from game to game, with the only similarity being that Scorpion wears yellow and Sub-Zero wears blue. They don't really have any one outfit that you can picture and say "That's Scorpion's/Sub-Zero's costume." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was thinking about Steve Fox, and how instead of kicks, he has dodges and sidesteps in his moveset. I find him to be one of my favorite (probably my very favorite) character to use in any fighter because of the fact that no other character (that I've seen) has this trait.

Obviously, if you're playing a 3D fighter, you could always simply sidestep into the foreground or background, but I think it's different with Steve. His evasion moves can make for some pretty badass defensive sequences and can make the user think about his strategy differently than he would with most other characters.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> And the vicious cycle I'm referring to is this:

A person drinks to get over depression. (S)he consumes enough alcohol that the next day, they feel depressed, even perhaps when he or she normally doesn't, so he/she drinks more alcohol to get over the depression.

The next day, more depression, more alcohol.

Then more depression caused by more alcohol, and more alcohol caused by more depression.

Is this a completely unavoidable situation?

I'll be completely honest as to why I'm asking-- I'm an inexperienced drinker and last night I bought a bottle of Smirnoff Ice (1 pint 6 oz or 650mL, only like 4.5% ABV) and drank about half of it. Made me feel kinda good, but I wasn't drunk or even close to it. Just buzzed, and barely tbqh.

Then today, I'm kinda bleh (no hangover, no headache, just kinda low). So my first instinct-- "Maybe I should have a drink again."

But then I fear that the cycle I described above might start. Am I always going to feel depressed the next day every time I get buzzed? Or is there a way to keep that from happening? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> To answer your question that has nothing to do with the topic at hand, I bought a 65" rear projection TV some years ago, and it wouldn't fit through the front door of the house. We had to take it in through the back, and instead of taking the TV to my bedroom, I took my bedroom to the TV.

And all the landline cords and the router/modem setup is in the basement, since that's actually the most conducive place to put it based on how my house is built, and I don't have the Wi-Fi device for my Xbox 360. So, if I'm upstairs, no Xbox Live, and no TV to play it on anyway. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'll try to keep this as brief as I can, since I tend to ramble.

I'm 6'4 (almost 200 cm/2 meters for those on the metric system-- and no, that's not my real height with 2-3 inches added), and it seems like the world isn't designed for people my height and taller. I constantly have to bend down/lean forward to grab or look at things, and as a result, I have a really bad slouch. It's to the point where standing/sitting perfectly straight feels like a workout.

I have no idea how to fix this problem, since I'm so used to the way I stand and sit right now (I'm 25, and I've been 6'2-6'4 since I was about 16 or 17 I think).

What can I do to fix this problem? I don't want my spine to be permanently mangled by the time I'm 50-60; at the same time, though, I think I should take baby steps with this until I get more accustomed to standing/sitting straight.

Thanks, guys. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> This isn't a pickup line per se, but I've always found this situation to be frustrating. She's super hot, but you can't chat her up during your transaction-- it doesn't take long enough, and you can't just stand there holding up the people behind you. So here's what I do (and it's worked a couple times).

What you'll need: A pen, a post-it note, and a little bit of stealth

What you do: Walk into the store, ID the girl you want to talk to. As soon as you walk in, make sure she can't see you put the pen on the counter-- a good way to do this is to do it as you bend down to tie your shoes (leave one shoe untied to make it more convincing).

When you're checking out, put your items on the counter and put your post-it note to the side (maybe take it out of your pocket as if you're looking for your money/wallet/card and just want to discard it for a second).

This is where the pen from the beginning comes in. Ask her "Hey, can I borrow that pen?" She'll assume it's the store's, and she'll say sure.

While she's ringing you up, write your name and number on the post-it note. Take your items and your change, and then give her this:

"Oh, here's your pen back... thanks. And here's my phone number. Call me."

And then calmly walk out of the door with a smile on your face. MAKE SURE YOU SMILE. Add a wink if you're feeling particularly confident. It also helps if you can at least make small talk during the process-- try to make her laugh or smile.

Like I said, this has worked for me at least twice, and one time it didn't work, the girl still said it was "cute."

Just thought I'd share a solution to a problem I hate. Didn't really know where else to put it.

This is gonna get downvoted straight to the eighth circle of Hell, isn't it? :-( </TEXT>

**Our downvotes will blot out the sun!**

**... then I will post in the shade.**

Okay... once. Only once. She really liked me, I really liked her, she was super hot, and we were in bed together watching a movie... oh, and I forgot to mention that she's a borderline alcoholic who can't handle her liquor. Bad combination.

Anyway, the inevitable happened, and I tried, I *really, really tried* to resist the urges. Devil on one shoulder, angel on the other... let's face it. Considering it was the first time and I wasn't ready for it, the angel didn't stand a chance and pretty much got gunned down immediately by ol' Beelzebub.

I stopped the movie we were watching and turned off the TV. I went to undo her belt and take off her jeans, and by the time I did that, she was actually forcing my head into her crotch with both hands. I had never given oral sex before, so I tried to tell her no, but (and I doubt she even remembers any of this), she persisted, so I considered it a tradeoff.

I went down on her after I undressed her down to her lingerie, while also touching her sensually the way I like. We both got what we wanted that night (I think so... I'm still not sure how good I was-- she did a lot of heavy moaning, though, so that's worth something, I guess).

Anyway, that's the story. Nobody had to use a rape whistle, or get their brother to beat anybody up, and no one went to jail. It went pretty much as well as it possibly could have, for both parties involved. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Parents? HELL no.

Friends? Some. Only the ones I'm closest to.

As far as women I'm with, I tell them up front. This is the sort of thing that you don't really want coming up without warning. _

Anyways, I just explain to them how I tend to prefer soft, romantic touching, kissing, etc., over harder, erotic bedroom activities. Then I usually ask them if they like to spoon, and if they say yes, then I ask if I can do things while they're asleep, like touch, kiss, undress them, etc.

Having this conversation with a woman is a LOT easier than it sounds. I've never gotten a "No" when asking if I can act on this fetish.

Jesus must love me, because I never thought that would happen the first time I told a woman about this. I thought for sure she'd be creeped out and run away immediately. _ </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Where do you actually find this type of porn? Is it just called sleep fetish?

Pretty much. Hell, there are [YouTube videos](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3LvpaUWQ0Y) that aren't even porn that I can masturbate to. The lack of intercourse isn't a big deal, since I'm not a big fan of it.

Yes, I and my sex drive are both extremely weird.

 What do you think it is about this that get's you worked up?

The freedom to do what I want without being judged, perhaps. Like I said, I don't like intercourse at all. Contrarily, women want to be fucked. I don't want to fuck. I just want to touch a woman's body sensually-- I can and have done so literally all night more than once.

If the woman is unresponsive (but not dead-- just making sure we establish that I would never even think about going that far), she doesn't have to be annoyed by my weird sexual habits and impulses. </TEXT>
