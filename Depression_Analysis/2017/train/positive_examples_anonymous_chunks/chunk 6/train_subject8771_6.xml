	<TEXT> I feel like the most likely outcome in this season is that Korra loses her bending. i know nobody wants that to happen, but I think if this happens she will be able to get more in touch with her spiritual side. I think it was mentioned in a post somewhere that [Amon closes a chakra in order to prevent a person from bending](/spoiler). If Korra is able to get in touch with her spiritual side, she could unlock it and then kick his butt.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This totally happened to me cept I was about to take a Latin final and I mentioned briefly that I spend a lot of time on the avatar sub-reddit...A girl in my class got real excited then. Her eyes got wide and her gasp could have been heard a mile away. It was hilarious and we then proceeded to geek away about Avatar. Good times.  </TEXT>
