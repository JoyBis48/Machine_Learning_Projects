	<TEXT> I should probably add my two cents here too. 

Best: Provides a sturdy shelf for balancing my plate on while I'm eating. Some tops/dresses look better with some chesticle shapes. They feel pretty damn good.   

Worst: Lying on my back - they flatten out and leak to the sides, not ideal. In addition to sagging, I'm worried about getting cleavage wrinkles as I age.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I suspect it may be related to the anger she has towards my father who left us when I was 7 years old. They had huge problems even before I was born and they thought having me would help their marriage. They thought wrong. 

As a teen I figured we didn't get along because I was a typical broody teen but as I got older and moved out I realised it went beyond that, she just really didn't like me. At 29, I'm really sad that we don't have a good relationship. I just don't know what to do.

The silver lining is, as I watch her get colder and more miserable I'm working on being warmer, happier and kinder to others.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My mother told me my eldest brother is her favourite child while I was her least favourite, I was 10 years old.

When I was 13 we were approached by a homeless man who wanted to shake our hands. She got up and quickly walked away while I was left there awkwardly not wanting to touch his hand but not wanting to be rude either. She didn't turn back once to see if I was ok. Later when I caught up to her, she yelled at me for talking to the homeless guy. 

6 years ago I got pretty sick and needed a bone marrow transplant, my eldest brother didn't want to do a blood test to see if he was a match. My mother defended him and explained that he's busy at work and can't take time off. </TEXT>
