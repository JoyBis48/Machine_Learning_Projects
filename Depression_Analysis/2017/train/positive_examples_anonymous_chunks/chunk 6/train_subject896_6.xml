	<TEXT> I've been meaning to post a "Why I don't think Fallout 4 will be released anytime soon" thing and this is kinda why. I would definitely love to see, at the very least, Fallout 1 bought by Bethesda and remodeled to be that open world adventure we've been waiting on. There would have to be alot added to the game but there could be a button to switch to top-down RTS view. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> One mod: Unlimited Followers. 
I don't think the people that would follow you, no matter what game, would really stop following just cause theres one other person. They'd see them and think "Wow, he already has a good following. Maybe his cause truly is just." and BAM! another groupie on the road. *except ED-E and Rex/Dogmeat* </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was just thinking, cause I have seen so many titles, quotes, ingame jokes, that I thought we should have a collection post of all the flairs on the subreddit.

I will start with mine, being "There is always another enemy" which I found on the Midwest BoS wiki page and I really liked it cause it's true in the Lone Wanderer's case and The Courier's case. They both can help one side but there's gonna be someone that hates them a whole heck of a lot because of their choices, thus, creating another enemy.

So, post your flairs and why you chose them! GO! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> SPOILER ALERT: The Detterent PC Mod

There was a Paldain in Storm City talking about how his whole squad got wiped out by one "really fucking big mutant" and I swear to god I sprinted to that area in hopes of a behemoth somehow and I was so disappointed when I shot down the Super Mutant leader he was talking about. So sad but I agree, Behemoths where the shit. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So I am getting near the end of my first PC run and trying to decide How I wana do the DLC this time. I believe the first time I did it on Xbox I went in the order of Honest Hearts, Lonesome Road, Old World Blues, and then Dead Money.

Either way, I'm not too excited for Dead Money. I'm thinking about switching to Lonesome Road, Old World Blues, Honest Hearts, and then Dead Money. I really enjoy alot of the stuff you get from HH but there alot of cool shit in LR too. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> At Quarry Junction, whatever you get off the deathclaws(Hands and Eggs) can be sold for a fair price with an 50 barter. There is a little cave deep in with an LMG, I believe two clips, a mini nuke, and a few deathclaw eggs.(I have never found the Fat Man but I will be going back shortly to look for that.)

At the Deathclaw Promontory(Go to Blue Paradise Vacation Rentals, across the river, kill the few lakelurks, go North untill you see the red markers then go uphill and take them out) there is also a few more hands and eggs which make a fair profit, but more importantly, there is a suit of Remnants Power armor(w/o helmet), a full T-51b armor, a Multiplas plasma rifle, and a Tri-Beam Laser Rifle.

Honestly, this is probably cause I wasted charisma for 10 luck, I have little to no problem picking them off from a mid-range distance with my GRA Tri-Beam w/ all upgrades. I also only use Combat Armor Mk. 2 rather than the Power Armor. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In the words of 343 (who I know has nothing to do with Fallout), Gameplay trumps lore. Maybe your character is born with a resistance to small amounts of radiation. Maybe on FO4 they'll make a DLC where you go to NYC and the first thing your given is a super rad-suit. Interesting twist. </TEXT>

And I guess it's just cause I find Boone to be such a bad ass. He is honestly my #2 favorite companion of all the ones I have which is only topped by Mr. Peepers, my deathclaw. </TEXT>

Anyway, I don't know. I can't double cross the NCR with Boone in my party cause he will get his panties in a bunch and out of all my followers , he is scarier than the deathclaw. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So I just started up my first PC playthrough after 100%ing the gameplay on Xbox. This run so far is an energy weapons one. I'm only level 20 and not too far into the main questline but I'm at the point that I need to choose which line I want to go. 
I have House, who I have always liked considering the fact that he shielded his city and it's people. 
Then there is also the NCR, who for a while considered me to be one of their soldiers until I killed the merc group bugging Jacobstown.
I really can't decide and would love some feedback if anyone has any! </TEXT>
