	<TEXT> Do people ever say this? But yeah I'm pretty sure no one who's clued up as to where they are in their own cycle (hardly any of us have clockwork regular cycles btw) would be clueless enough to assume that you can't get pregnant with the rhythm method (timing sex to the non-fertile phases of your period).
For reals, it's just safe to assume you're always gonna get pregnant, and even if you aren't receptive at the time of having sex, sperm can hang around in there and wait 'till you are.

Edit: Sorry, forgot this was Reddit, where we all live in constant fear from the very real threat of sperm-jacking hussies. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I wish I could remember the source, but I read an article recently about trends in how American parents are naming their children. Apparently for boys, for example, '-aiden' type sounding names are becoming hugely popular, but variations in how this sound is spelled differ. So though there is a trend towards certain similar sounding names, parents are seeking originality in child-naming through the precise spelling.

So...yeah, that's pretty cool.

But for sure this anti-unusual-child-names jerk annoys me especially for some reason. It's pretty much just anti-poverty and anti-race sentiment dressed up as faux concern that "yeah but that kid will get bullied for having a weird name, aw naw".
Yes. That is definitely why it is necessary to point and laugh at the children and their parents. Outstanding. /rant.

Edit: Yeah you're right about the anti-middle class(and/or whatever the American equivalent of middle class is, I know it doesn't mean quite the same thing outside Britain) names too. I think Redditors are mostly just looking for reasons to despise other people for no real reason.

	<TEXT> Well yeah, I think most people would agree with you on that one. But is this post really about being concerned for children? Of course not, it's about pointing and laughing at the children with the funny names and their *obviously* stupid or obnoxious parents for choosing them.

Edit: 
 why intentionally make it harder on a child?

This whole thread and the many other shitty ones like it here on Reddit are certainly not making it any easier for one thing... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Definitely a name says a lot about us and it's one of those difficult things that something so personal as our own name isn't chosen for us, but by our parents. I think I would consider myself fortunate to have the first names my parents gave me and I don't think I will ever be judged in the way you described based on my name.
I agree that parents do have a responsibility to name their children in a way that will give them a dignified start in life.

But for the love of all that is good I am so sick of this unoriginal and persistent circlejerk we all seem to have here about bashing children for having weird names all the time. Surely that just adds to stigma of unusual or ethnic names? I mean, for Christ's sake, literally making fun of children's names, how fucking witty and insightful. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I get these feelings too buddy. But you must remember that the internet, and those who post things on it, are by definition a skewed and non-representative sample of the real world population. That is that those with the most time to post or who spend the most time online contribute more online material, possibly making it seem like those opinions are the most common. Those who are less internet addicted, who have busier lives away from the internet are likely to post less. Also those with stronger feelings about something are more likely to feel compelled to post a lot online about them. 

And if it makes you feel better, there is a lot of evidence to suggest that the opinions we express, particularly hateful ones (the study I am thinking of focused on racist attitudes), are not necessarily the ones we are likely to act on (EDIT: I.e. we say a whole lot of crap without really meaning it, particularly if it is angry or unkind). I'm sure there's been times when you've been upset and thought, maybe even said something hateful, only to realise as soon as you were back to normal that you really don't mean that at all. If you are stuck in a perpetually unhappy state of mind, feel scared by social changes happening around you, or rejected by others, then you're less likely to respond with empathy towards others. "Women seem wicked when you're not wanted" and all that.

So please don't feel unhappy. TRPers are just people who are working through some stuff. Like all of us, empathy only comes with unclouded and calm thinking. If you left Reddit, as I said above, the more bitter and hateful people would remain, and the impression that everyone out there is filled with hate would perpetuate all the more, see? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> But for the love of God *not* another fat acceptance sub, not that those aren't super, I'm sure. But as someone who isn't fat I feel rather alienated by them. 

I have had issues with my face for years, after a spot of bullying, but really have a hard time finding places online to talk about it or read about other people's experiences. It's starting to stop me going out to places so much these past few months, particularly when I'm stressed, and I just want to get things back on track and not worry so much about it. Hearing from like-minded people could be a real help but I've no idea where to start.

My boyfriend has suggested treating me to having a makeover or whatever from a professional but the idea of having another women near to and judging my face makes me teary and worried to just think about. I've made getting comfortable enough to make that happen my goal and would like to see how people in a similar situation got there :)

So I guess some similar sub where people work through and share advice about social phobias could also be helpful, though not exactly specifically relevant.

Ideas? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Considering it cost me less than £6 I'm very happy with it. Now my boys have two decent covered beds to go to should they want some space (uneutered boars reaching that hormonal stage so :p not that they don't get on well). It's really soft on the inside and has a super fleecy insert that seems very comfy. Maybe it's a little big for piggies, being designed for cats, but it's a good shape  and provides decent cover, and if you have multiple pigs they could easily on pile in there together. If Tristram (pictured) ends up chewing it to pieces then I'm not too fussed given that it was relatively inexpensive, but I can see it lasting a good while, maybe requiring a regular wash with the rest of their fleece. 

TL:DR It's cheap and would totes recommend. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think there's a weird sort of duality with mental health and other unseen illnesses. I know that (and maybe I'm just lucky here?) but were I to tell any of my fellow students or friends that I was suffering from anxiety or depression, they'd be perfectly sympathetic. But having said that, I find that answering the question "how are you?" with anything other than some variation of "fine" isn't normally so well-received. Not that I go around telling people I'm unhappy, and for the most part I'd consider myself a reasonably happy person these days, but you get the idea. 

TL:DR I think that people are generally very sympathetic to mental health problems as concepts (in my experience) but that people don't normally feel comfortable or able to respond to the immediate details of them or the emotions involved. Or something. </TEXT>
