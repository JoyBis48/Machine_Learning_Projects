	<TEXT> My grandpa has had a near death experience and said there is a tunnel with light at the end. It fascinated me when I was younger and I would like to believe this. He was religious, I'm not. I like the idea of there being a good place after this. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I really needed to get home from work a couple weeks ago. It was 11pm and the bus stop is shared with the local football stadium. Local football team had won the game with 6-1 that night so the bus was full of drunk men. One of them sat on me, claimed he had not seen me while his hands went into my coat. He was so heavy, I couldn't really do anything. One of the few sober people on that bus pulled him off me as soon as he saw what was actually going on. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I once woke up in the middle of the night from a strange flickering orange light outside my window. I opened my curtains and saw the hedge connected to our house was on fire. I woke up my parents and sister. While my dad called the emergency line, my mum and I woke our neighbors. A couple lives have been saved that night, I don't know what would've happened if I did not wake up. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You can also craft the drop of luck. That's what I've been doing. If you open the blue witchery book about the cauldron's recipes (Witches Brews) and hover over the ingredients for drop of luck, you'll see how much power you need for some of them. I don't know the total amount of power by heart but it's quite a lot so I skipped the cauldron recipe for drop of luck.. On our server, the crafting recipe in a normal workbench worked as well. Maybe try that :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If one magic mod has in-game documentation, it has to be Witchery. There are now about 8 or 9 books. The mod adds a lot of small things that are fun or nifty, so you might lose yourself in all the possibilities. I know I don't have a goal yet to work towards, not sure what I wanna do first out of these 8-9 topics and what's considered end-game. I do know it's an awesome mod :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> To be really honest, I think it would be amazing if newcomers can just sneak into the portal while the other teams are still fighting out there. Also Chad should make a brand new bow and let someone combine bows with the rubbish one he has now..

Crazy episode this was. Lot of circling around each other and following each other into and out it the nether, all going from that one portal back to 0,0.. Damn! Can't wait til Monday! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They saw Baj sneak away, been mentioned a few times in this thread. I think they'll be fine and it can get very interesting in the overworld since Nancy Drew, Leftovers and this team will all three be relatively close to each other. </TEXT>
