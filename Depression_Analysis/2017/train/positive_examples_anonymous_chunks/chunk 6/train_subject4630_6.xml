	<TEXT> Paranoid - they drape my weary cries, exclamations of an educated mind, in exquisite explanations, intent on restricting my elementary observations. I lash at their less than subtle attempts at relaying these lies, tarnishing their own word, with each expression of good enduring. They put me in the well, a wash of white flashing as my mind thrashes through their poison. They tell me I am not, for the world, to be trusted; that I should game my already-adaptive intellect by associating with their filthy dances. They are all around me; again, I cry, they will not stop speaking. I see them fly, they can see my every move, here my thoughts! I must retreat, my thought has fallen, swooping around me, they invade; what do they want from me? I cannot traverse my head without encountering their trespass! "Oh God," I exclaim, and refuse to yield. They will find my corpse before they control that which I hold. </TEXT>
