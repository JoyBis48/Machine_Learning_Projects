	<TEXT> Also ways I fixed my diet was... 

*lunch I have loads of fruit, gives me some of that natural energy to push me through the rest of the day.

*morning is my protein based meal like egg whites ,peanut butter on whole wheat

*dinner is more of my veggies mostly green one which are the one I like the most haha maybe a portion of chicken or lean stake (size of your palm).

*snacks I mainly just eat fruits maybe some string cheese, low-fat yogurt or Greek yogurt.
