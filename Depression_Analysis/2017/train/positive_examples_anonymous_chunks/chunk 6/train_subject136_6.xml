	<TEXT> After seeing the picture, I personally don't think it's a big deal, but I won't speak for the rest of my race (i'm black).  I think a large part of the issue is that it is a slippery slope and the last thing black people want is for someone to keep pushing the envelope until you wind up with full-on black face. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> First major breakup?  Sorry to hear that.  Here's a bro hug.

It's tough, I know how you feel.  I've been there.

Use this time for self-reflection and ask yourself why this girl has defined your life.  

I'll share this quote from /u/Granite-M

 Nothing you say can touch the other person, because she has already taken herself out of the relationship and will not allow herself to be moved or empathetically affected by what you say. Her need to maintain a sense of goodness and righteousness, and her intolerance for feeling guilty and vulnerable, makes such a person unavailable for a genuine and authentic exchange. **Nothing you can do or say will ever really reach her.**

	<TEXT> The trouble with "love" as portrayed in Western society is that it is not this 24/7 feeling of bliss most people think it is.  Most of the time you really like that person.  Other times the feeling isn't as strong.

The problem with chasing that feeling, especially for a girl your age, is that you could end up worse off than you are now.  I've known girls who have perpetually chased this feeling and are now in their mid-30s and full of regret.  They wished that they'd stayed with their "boring" ex.

But don't get me wrong, if the feeling isn't there don't force it and settle.  Just understand the risk.

EDIT:  Replace girl with guy.  Advice still applies.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Normal feelings... No matter which way you go you ARE going to wonder what would have happened if you did the alternative.  I was in a similar situation, here's my advice.

1.  If you leave, then you will be very sad and miss her.  Even if things weren't perfect, as human beings we get accustomed to companionship.  Unless you've completely checked out mentally it will be very hard to walk away and not feel absolutely miserable.

2.  If you stay, then you will continue to feel like you do now.  Every now and then it will go away but there will be times where you continue to question if she's "the one."  The pressure will continue to mount until you get married.

PRO TIP:  There's no such thing as the one.  So let go of that concept.

Ultimately, the decision is up to you.  I wound up leaving my girl.  I regret it but I also know we would have eventually broken up anyway.    Good luck with whatever you decide to do.  8 years is a long time to throw away.  But if you can't see it working out then you know what you have to do. </TEXT>

No Contact is up to you.  I personally think it's good to get your mind straight but I disagree with it as a "one size fits all" solution to breakups.  Just know that it doesn't answer anything and you will still think about her from time to time. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [30M, 30F] Lessons learned... There's no formula for handling a breakup! </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-09-20 06:40:28 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> It has been on my spirit recently to share some words with you all.

As some of you know, I have been on a journey of heartbreak and recovery for two years now.  I have tried just about every method out there and even purchased some e-books from so-called relationship gurus about *“How to win your ex back”*.  (I admit, I am ashamed of this)

I have done it all.  I’ve tried NC.  I’ve broken NC.  Being friends, not being friends.  You name it.

Here’s the conclusion I’ve come to:


**THERE’S NO FORMULA FOR HANDLING A BREAKUP!**



Wait let me repeat that with slightly better diction….

**THERE IS NO FORMULA FOR HANDLING A BREAKUP!**


Case in point.  Last night, my ex of 7 years texted me wanting to catch up.  We were at a period of about 50 days no contact.  I asked all my close friends what I should do an ultimately settled on talking to her under one condition:  I would express how I felt.

You see, I haven’t been honest with myself.  I’ve been very passive aggressive.  I’ve sat and let all the hurt and pain stew in my heart.  I did this because I believed that I was hurting her as well (this is true).  I did it hoping deep down that maybe she’d realize the error of her ways, call me up, and want to get back together.

In reality this doesn’t work.  The main reason being that nobody has ever wanted to be with another person due to guilt.

But onto the phone call… It started pretty innocently.  We chatted about TV shows before she asked me how my anxiety was going.  I took this opportunity to express how I felt.  I told her that she hurt me and had been continuing to hurt me with her actions.  I gave concrete examples.  She started crying, offered no explanation, and merely said she was sorry.

This launched us into a debate about the past that I did not want to get into.  I merely wanted to talk about actions that happened post breakup, not shit that happened 5 years ago.  Nonetheless, it happened.  And as usual, no consensus was formed.

At the end of it all, tears were shed on both sides.  I did not get the answers I was seeking, and I will admit that it hurt.  BUT I was able to get my emotions off my chest and I was able to realize that the person I had been holding these conflicting feelings against was human.

Most importantly I realized that I needed to let it go.  I needed to forgive her.  I needed to forgive myself… and I needed to move on.  No more games, no more tactics from relationship gurus.  Just an honest conversation between two people who shared some great times and some bad times for 7 years.  

In summary,  I know I broke a lot of rules… But I don’t care.  This was something I had to do for ME.  A lot of times people do things hoping to make the other person mad or jealous.  That’s not the way to go.  There’s no formula to this thing.  Be honest with yourself and who you are and start from there.  Come to terms with the fact that you may not get the desired outcome.  Come to terms with the fact that the other person may not be thinking of you.  Let go of that need inside you to control your outcome.  And if all else fails, chalk it up as a learning experience and live life.  You owe it to yourself.

Even with everything I said above, depending on your situation, it may not apply.  That’s the point of this post.  No one can tell you how to handle your situation.  Everybody is different.  Personally, me and my ex ended due to factors outside our control.  The fact that there was no “major incident” is what kept me holding on.

***
TLDR:  Each situation is different and there is no “one size fits all” solution to a break up.  If you need guidance, start by respecting and loving yourself. </TEXT>
