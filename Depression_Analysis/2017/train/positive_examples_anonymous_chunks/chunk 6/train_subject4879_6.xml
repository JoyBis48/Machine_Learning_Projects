	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I applied to a supermarket chain, and on the website i was able to apply to multiple branches at a time. I was contacted last week for an interview for one branch, about about 25 minutes from my house by transit, and immediately after accepting that job, i was contacted by another branch, a 2 minute walk from my house, for a phone interview. what do i do in this situation? what do i say to the second branch?

thanks

any response is appreciated </TEXT>
