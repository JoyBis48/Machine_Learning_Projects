	<TEXT> Thank you. Oh and just to add, they live on benefits via the government and maintenance payments. His wife's four kids have 3 Fathers involved{the word whore spring to mind-sorry I'm narked off} and they get maintenance from them and me. I also recently found out that if I were to go on benefits, then the child support agency would take money from that. Baring in mind that the benefit I would receive would be the absolute minimum that a human can get by on.{according to the Governments calculations} Amusing huh.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There are many comments in this thread from heterosexual males, saying how sometimes they just aren't in the mood sometimes. I have a high sex drive and have found that in most of my relationships that the guy has a lower sex drive than I.  Only once have I met a man who had a higher sex driver than me.

p.s I do actually have gay friends. But some of them have high sex drives too, or so they say . . </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Simple things like my make up is smudged. Or my shoes look ridiculous with that dress, would be sufficient. I'm not talking about things like, does my bum look big in this, because that is a daft question.  I know that if I have a big arse, it's my arse not the dress making it look big. I also return the favour to my fella and shower him in compliments when he looks fiiiiine! :)  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thrush. Most men don't get thrush unless they catch it from a female.  Oh and guys, it's a yeast infection that can be set off by the wrong material underwear/stress/vigorous sex/hormonal inbalance/change in soap/changing in washing powder/giving birth. If you get it real bad, you can barely walk. It hurts and itches like hell. It's also REALLY embarrassing, going to the store to get the magic cream to make it go away. p.s Do not have sex with any women unless she has been clear of thrush for at least 24hours.  </TEXT>
