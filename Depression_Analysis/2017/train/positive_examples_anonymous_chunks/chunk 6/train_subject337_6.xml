I think it's a great example of how humanity has basically invented a near-perfect way to describe the world around us.

2) My college psychiatrist kept trying to say I had depression and I was convinced that my moods were perfectly fine. So I sought out a psychologist for a full objective workup and testing.

3) In some ways I'm happy I did it because (after therapy) I became more aware of my actions and why I behave the way I do. In other ways I wish I'd never gotten diagnosed. I was happy just being a shitty person. Now I'm trying way too hard at everything I do, and I'm putting way too much effort into trying to be a normal functioning member of society.

If I was a better person I'd know how to help him, but for now all I can think to do is be someone he feels comfortable talking to. I'd like for him to be able to come to me if he's struggling with certain dark thoughts, or having trouble dealing with our mother. I told him "take it from me; I survived that shithole and got out." I've also already invited him to come stay with me the summer between high school and college, just to get him out of that house even sooner.

	<TEXT> You're mistaking reddit for the internet. Of course there are dark corners of the web, but that's less than 1% of the every-day user base. Way to go on making a moot point.

The fat people on The Biggest Loser aren't being wildly accepted. Otherwise it would be called The Biggest People Who Aren't Going To Lose Weight. That show is literally trying to make these people not fat anymore, and does do through lots of fat shaming and generally making these people feel like absolute shit about their body.

I see you've given up on arguing the original point at hand, and have resorted to dissecting the intricacies of part of what I say, rather than understanding the broader point.

Good day. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Here we go.

Like what others are saying. Being fat is something a person can control. You can't control being a certain race. While you can control being a certain religion (to an arguable extent not fit for right here), it's not unhealthy to be one versus another; it's a personal preference.

I'm against people who are trying to convince the public that fat is perfectly healthy. It's setting a despicable standard, and they are arguing against decades, if not centuries, of medical research. By trying to save the feelings of people who make poor life choices, society is enabling them to continue to make those choices.

Think about smokers. Everyone knows that smoking is bad for you. Everyone knows that it causes cancer and lung disease and all kinds of nasty things. But you don't see a group of smokers trying to tell the public that it's perfectly healthy, just because someone said they were gross for being a smoker. You don't see them saying "I'm perfectly healthy *right now* therefor it must be a healthy lifestyle choice." But you see obese people saying "I'm perfectly healthy *right now* therefor my obesity must not be a health issue."

Do you get it now? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thought I'd share. I have a friend from high school with whom I've stayed close (we're 25 now). We hadn't seen each other in a while because I moved away a couple years ago, but I was in town recently and we met for dinner. She recently got divorced and told me that it happened while her and the husband were trying to conceive. So we got on the topic of kids. She's definitely a mother person. I'm wholly surprised she hasn't yet popped any out. But I told her I was firm in not wanting kids, and she was so accepting of that. She even went on to say she couldn't even picture me with kids. Made me so happy. It's unusual to have a parenting-type person understand the desire to have a career without a family, especially at the age I am now.

I hope all of you have a friend like that. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey r/soc. Haven't visited in a while, but wanted to get some discussion and see what you all think.

My kid brother is 14 and he's showing signs of developing ASPD. Our mother is textbook narcissistic, and it seems like she's perceiving him as the golden child where I was the scapegoat (look up your NPD parenting types). If you're too lazy to look it up, imagine the (very extreme) family relationships in Bates Motel. Norman = golden child, his older brother = scapegoat. Both ones will fuck a kid up.

I was visiting recently, and I've been very open with him because I'm trying to educate and spare him. But he asked me things about killing people and how hard it would be emotionally. I gave him some resources (r/watchpeopledie, etc) to look at and see what he thinks/feels. He's already super apathetic, doesn't really care about anything. He doesn't get in trouble but he's also almost completely unsupervised. He's kind of doing the dance of "I'm going to do what my parents say just so they stop bitching at me" and then finds shortcuts around it to appease them. He doesn't have a lot of friends, very very introverted.

Some more stuff that is most likely just 14 year old boy stuff, but possibly worth mentioning: He says he's not smoking weed, but I'm not sure I believe him. He sneaks out of the house in the middle of the night and goes god only knows where. My parents live in the middle of fucking nowhere. He's a very convincible liar. His grades are going down, even though he's brilliant.

Not looking for an is he / isn't he discussion. He still has a few years before that's determinable. Just general talk. What do you guys think? How were you when you were 14? I was presenting differently at 14 and also much earlier than 14 (started showing signs around age 9sih; I'm 25 now). I was more of a liar/manipulator/conduct problem kid. I'm female, so not sure if that makes a difference in symptom presentation (not yet enough research done there). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 25F being asked to pay $9.99. I wonder if it has to do with activity level or something. I'd like to see whatever algorithms they're using to figure this out. </TEXT>
