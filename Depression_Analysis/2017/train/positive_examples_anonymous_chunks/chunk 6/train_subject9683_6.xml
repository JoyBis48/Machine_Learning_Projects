	<TEXT>  Hal Jordan will appear. Maybe not as Green Lantern, but just as Hal.

But they mentioned a pilot going missing on The Flash? Maybe he appears as a normal human in the flashbacks? or an alternate universe where ever Barry went.

andnbsp;

Also what about Slade Wilson, Walter Steele, Joe Wilson, or expanding on the story of Oliver's child.  </TEXT>

Also Oliver as Mayor would be awesome, it would be a good time to introduce new characters, maybe a new member to Team Arrow? or bring back the salmon ladder, and by salmon I mean Colin Salmon, Walter Steele. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I posted earlier that I was rewatching some of Season 2, and in Ep2x16 "Suicide Squad", when they're all talking to eachother and getting in position, they called John Diggle "Freelancer" and on the DC wikia (i know that's not anything official but) when you go to [John Diggle] (http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/John_Diggle_%28Arrow%29) and look under aliases, you see Freelancer, and it links to [this villain](http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Freelance), it also says he's an enemy of this superhero named Triumph, so maybe Triumph will be introduced? Also off-topic, but Lyla Michaels in the comics is Harbinger who has some connection to Supergirl, so just a heads up on  possible future crossovers. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> actually looking back at my post, i don't think Deathstroke could be a main villain, cuz what would he do different than in Season 2? Oliver has nobody anymore, and by Season 6, Speedy will be able to protect herself. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm hoping that maybe Roy Harper is pulling a Malcolm Merlyn. Maybe sometime in Season 5, the police agree with The Green Arrow and they get the news that Roy Harper faked his death and he's welcomed back to the probably renamed 'Star City' by Ray Palmer. 

Also, my thoughts for main villains to prolong the series.

Season 4 - Damien Darhk

Season 5 - More H.I.V.E. stuff/Return of Deadshot

Season 6 - Deathstroke back(will appear in both previous seasons in smaller roles)

Season 7 - Merlyn

Season 8 - Chien Na Wei

	<TEXT> nah, I wasn't mocking, it's just that I don't think Wattpad has much variety in readers, most of them are teenage girls looking for something about One Direction or some cheesy romance story. I guess it's just not the right site for me :( </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Question: Is this a fan-fiction? </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I have an account on Wattpad (and fanfiction.net, but anyways.) I'm writing a story about the shows 'The Flash' and 'Arrow', basically my version of how they will go on after Arrow Season 3 and Flash Season 1. Is it considered a fan-fiction? Because every time I look at a list of fan-fictions, it's always about some teenage girl meeting Harry Styles or about Harry Potter and Hermione's love life, and I never see regular adventure or horror or crime or science fiction stories, it's always romance. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you look at the list of Green Arrow villains http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Green_Arrow_enemies

All of the main ones have appeared, except Onomatopoeia.

The rest are dead, arrested, in an A.R.G.U.S. max prison, or leading the League of Assassins. </TEXT>
