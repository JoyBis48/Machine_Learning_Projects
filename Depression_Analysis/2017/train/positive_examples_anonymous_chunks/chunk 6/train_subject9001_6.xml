	<TEXT> What I garnered from this video was how society reacts to confidence in someone out of the ordinary. They first try to figure her out, questioning her gender, asking if she is being payed for this. When she doesn't respond, they resort to taunting her, throwing things, splashing her with water, and one person actually shoves her to the ground; all in an attempt to provoke a reaction.  </TEXT>
