	<TEXT> last weekend i hooked up with a girl after a fun night out. we had a great time, and then i guess it got pretty intimate not just physically but on a personal level. we ended up getting to religion and i explained my deconversion. she told me she was actually a devout christian which really caught me off guard, considering everything she had just done was probably a sin in her opinion. then she said that people have tried to prove the bible false, but that no one has been able to. i was shocked at her confidence, and i don't have any concrete evidence, but i highly highly highly doubt that the bible is inerrant. 

tl;dr, hooked up with a christian girl. she was very christian, but also didn't feel guilty. i was surprised. 

thoughts?
