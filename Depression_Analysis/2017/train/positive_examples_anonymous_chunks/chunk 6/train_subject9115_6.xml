	<TEXT> Owning a gun isn't a basic human right. 

The idea of basic human rights came around during the Enlightenment era, and that they were endowed upon humanity by their creator. That's freedom of speech, religion, etc. I can't think of any enlightenment philosopher that mentioned guns.

You can accurately say owning a gun is a constitutional right, but that doesn't make it a natural right or a basic human right.

Also, banning some guns in some circumstances isn't infringing on the 2nd amendment. If it were, making it illegal to yell "FIRE!" is a crowded theater for fun would be a violation of the 1st amendment and freedom of speech. </TEXT>

Ultrasounds can tell how old a fetus is, right? So if an ultrasound says a fetus is 8 weeks old for instance, the pregnancy is really 10 weeks along since it's measured by mother's LMP, not conception.

But what if a woman hasn't had a period for two months before discovering she was pregnant? Would they just estimate the pregnancy is about 10 weeks along if her fetus measures 8 weeks old? </TEXT>

Not true. All embryos start out undifferentiated by default. They're still male or female, but there's no physical difference yet. They form the same body parts early on that later sexual organs will stem from. At some point during development, the Y chromosome switches on the SRY gene, which induces the formation male parts. If there is no Y chromosome or SRY gene, it continues development and forms female parts. 

No male fetus or embryo is ever female. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> People with terminal illnesses often can't feel better. Medicine can only do so much. Not to mention the medicine they give for pain often makes you very, very sick. Terminal patients are already very, very sick and this would make them feel worse.

if you asked your small 8 year old cousin if they wanted to die while they were in the midst of some sort of extremely painful experience they have no way to make a reasoned decision.

My hypothetical 8-year-old cousin isn't terminally ill and likely to die a slow and agonizing death within the next few months. That's the difference. The terminally ill *will* die and in extreme pain. You just want to draw it out and don't care that they're suffering needlessly because you think a miracle might occur.

I don't understand how you don't see that

I, as well as the Dutch Pediatric Association, understand that forcing a terminally ill child to continue an agonizing existence when they will certainly die soon anyway is cruel and inhumane. Even if you think a child cannot make a reasoned decision in this instance, the parents and the doctors can. 

As I said, what if someone made you continue to live in pain, not caring how much you're suffering, because they believed in the off chance a miracle could occur? That's what you want to do to these children. You're being flippant about their pain because you aren't the one suffering it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Someone is only considered terminal if their death is likely to happen within the next 6 months. Doctors tend to be optimistic here, meaning it's far more likely you'll be told you have a chance when you don't instead of the other way around. Patients also tend to die sooner than doctors estimate. These people are so sick their bodies often begin to shut down long before doctors think they should. 

You're doing nothing but forcing people to suffer on the off-chance a miracle will occur.

	<TEXT> the child has to say yes, you continue to ignore this. that is the point I am making, no child at the age of 9 is wise enough to decide whether to take their own life.

I am not ignoring it, I am saying I am okay with it because the child doesn't have the only say. The doctors know more about the disease a child might have than anyone else and know how much pain it might put someone in. That's why the Dutch Pediatric Association is backing it. They know exactly how much these kids are suffering. 

yes you should let them live instead of killing them based on how much pain they think they are in.

Which is one of the cruelest things you can do. You're okay with it because *you* aren't the one who has to suffer. The child is. What if you begged to die due to the extreme pain and sickness you felt and everyone refused and let you linger in agony?

 there is a chance of survival or pain reduction if they are still alive tomorrow, if they have been killed there is no chance of any of these possibly joyous and redemptive moments. a 9 year old cannot understand that, why I am saying they should not be able to say kill me. it very easily could be the worst pain of their life and they can't see an end, but a more wise and experienced person could realize their body might adjust and the pain becomes bearable or a new medicine could emerge making their final months/years very bearable, productive and joyful. a 9-year old just knows it hurts now and if being killed allows that to make the pain stop they might say yes without thinking about what that means or what it means to those they love, who will have to live with thinking "One more day and it might have gotten better" for the rest of their life

Very little chance. Especially for things like cancer and many genetic illnesses. There is a point where the body is so ravaged by disease that there's no going back, even if a miracle cure was found the next day. You're advocating letting kids spend their final moments in agony because of something that's extremely unlikely to happen. I've already showed you that doctors tend to be overly *optimistic* when it comes to determining if a patient is terminal and how long they have to live. They think a patient has a better chance of making it than they really do, not the other way around.

May as well spend your entire paycheck on the lottery with the mentality that basing your actions on something extremely unlikely is practical. Your stance is, "But a miracle might occur!"

I actually completely understand the fear men have here. Women have an out: abortion. Which is a good thing. I am completely pro-choice. I think it should even be publicly funded. But men have no such out. One night of sex that results in a pregnancy could potentially ruins a man's life. 18+ years of child support right there if the woman chooses to have the child. If I were a man, I might consider suicide if that happened to me. 18+ years of a large portion of my paycheck gone just like that? Yeah, not doing it.

This situation is why I am so thankful to be female. Whether or not I ever have to pay for a child isn't nearly so up to chance.

	<TEXT> Well, many pro-choicers, both on Reddit and elsewhere, have told me that they are unwilling to deal with any risk of an unwanted offspring being born. Thus, I see absolutely no reason for me to be okay with any risk of this occurring. However, since I myself obviously don't have the option of abortion (and would never rely on any woman's word that she will get an abortion regardless of whatever promises she made to me beforehand) and consider the idea of abstaining from penis-in-vagina sex with all fertile and potentially fertile women to be both utterly unrealistic and utterly unacceptable, there is no other acceptable choice for me in regards to achieving this goal other than castration due to the fact that all non-drastic contraceptives and sterilizations have a failure rate.

I completely understand this. In fact, I am a proponent for "financial abortion" for men (with plenty of government support for women who choose to go on to have the kid of course. That should be available to anyone who has children and needs it).

Anyway, as I see it, it's none of my business. It's between you and your doctor. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> the child has to say yes, that is my point. no child can make that decision, they have no reference point or understanding of what death entails or what it can do to those surrounding them.

Which is why their parents have to be involved and they have to be assessed by doctors before euthanasia is allowed. You're acting like they're just killing kids who walk in and ask to be killed. The child isn't the only one who has to give consent. The parents and doctors do as well, and they *do* have the life experiences and knowledge to make that decision, especially the doctors who deal with terminally ill patients every day. The doctors know how bad off the children are when assessing them.

a bureaucracy should not allow small children to choose to kill themselves as small children do not have the life experience that allows them to make a decision on that. it's simply absurd

So just let them wallow in pain and agony until their terminal illness finally kills them even though a number of adults (many of whom care for patients and study terminal illness for a living) have to sign off on the euthanasia? *That* is absurd. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Terminally ill patients have recovered, but that's rare. In truth, doctors are more likely to overestimate how likely it is that someone will survive their illness and overestimate how long someone has to live.

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/06/health/06mbrody.html?pagewanted=print_r=0

And it isn't just the child making the decision. The parents have a say, as well as a team of doctors who assess the child.

the fact you think they can makes me wonder how many 9 year olds you have been around

Probably not as many as the Dutch Pediatrics Association, which says they should have the option. </TEXT>

You speak for dead people?

It's like bridge jumpers - every problem suddenly seems trivial, except the fact that you're falling of a bridge.

Many people attempt suicide multiple times before they finally succeed. Not everyone jumps and then wishes they didn't.

But we're talking about terminally ill children. Children who will die from their ailment. There's nothing that can be done for them. All they're asking is to skip the pain and suffering before the death.

They try to mask euthanasia in medications and psychology, but it's just as horrible to die from it as it is from a disease, it just comes sooner.

If that's how you feel, fine. Never choose anesthesia. But let others have that option.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  I don't see a lot of compassion in the medical practice when 24 year olds are being euthanized not because of terminal illness but depression.

I think people often have no idea how awful depression is. They think it's just being down in the dumps for a little bit. Think about how much people with depression are suffering that they choose death over living.

Also, depression often isn't temporary. It can be lifelong. I've had it for over 16 years and it isn't going anywhere or getting much better despite treatment. Look at the resent suicide of Robin Williams. He had depression for over 40 years. That never went away.

Depression can often be eternal and at some point, it's cruel to keep someone alive against their wishes. </TEXT>

Not to be nit-picky here, but young mothers isn't the reason for the high mortality rate in childbirth. It's lack of medicine. Also, young children having babies wasn't as prevalent as you would think. It certainly happened, but it was mostly among the elite. They married off their children as soon as possible. The age of marriage and parenthood for the common people was always higher. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I first heard my grandma tell this story. Apparently my aunt was about 4-5 years old, and came running from the garden, visibly frightened, and swore that she saw a little man come up from the ground in the garden. His skin was completely black (as in the color, not the race) and he wore a black suit along with a black top hat. 

He invited her to come down into the ground with him, but when he spoke she could see he had little black razors for teeth. At that point she ran away.

Now, grandma says she's sure my aunt saw something. She was too frightened to be making it up. My aunt says she vaguely remembers seeing something black in the garden, but puts the rest of it to shadows and an overactive imagination.

I'm not sure what to think of this. Anyone have any ideas of what it could have been? </TEXT>
