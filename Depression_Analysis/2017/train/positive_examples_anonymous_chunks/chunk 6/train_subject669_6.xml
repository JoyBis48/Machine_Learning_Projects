	<TEXT> Agreed. Learning about the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in my microbiology class freaked me out a little.

A good side note is, if you actually need the antibiotics, take the whole prescription. Don't stop when you start feeling better. The leftover bacteria will contribute to growing resistance. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm a total newb to fitness so I have 3 stupid questions:

1. Any tips for doing a proper deadlift? I feel like I'm getting pains in my back for a reason.

2. Are there any exercises that you can't do with a EZ curl barbell that you normally can with a regular/straight barbell?

3. Whenever I use the inner thigh machine at the gym (squeezing thighs closed with about 40 lbs of weight) I get a very weird painful sensation in my groin, is that normal? I'm a girl if that helps. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My uncle (A black guy) went to Alaska on military duty and he got really "pale" for a black person but he didn't lose all this melanin. I think the difference is in brown people their melanocytes are genetically programmed to produce a base level of melanin, extra coloring is given as a result of sunlight stimulation. So he got paler because he lost the extra light stimulation but still had the base level of production.

	<TEXT> Just a thought about savings, not exactly correlated to race: if you work a crap job where you barely pull in enough to cover necessities, you're probably not going to have anything to put into savings. For example, I'm a college student who can only find part-jobs that work with my school schedule, most of those pay little. I can put some away, but if my tire blows or I have a health emergency, well I have to pull from saving and I'm back to square one.

And flashy items like what? I know black people who live in poor neighborhoods of big cities, and one guy had never seen an Ipod before and most didn't have internet access outside of a library. Shitty old cars and cheap furniture. I'm black btw, middle class. I'm not saying you're perspective isn't valid but I've seen otherwise. </TEXT>
