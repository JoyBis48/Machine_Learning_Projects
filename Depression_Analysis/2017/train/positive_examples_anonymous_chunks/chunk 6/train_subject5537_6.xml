	<TEXT> But the stat says that 632 players played for Arsenal **before** Wenger, and that 188 players played under Wenger. So you have to add those numbers up before you work out the percentage, making it 22.9%, which is still a hell of a lot! :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You're really confusing me now, so I'll try again from the top!

You asked why they would even try and fix a match, when the authorities were going to be scrutinising it. When you said 'they', I assumed you meant the Nigerian players.

In my reply I said they may still try and fix the match regardless, as these things often involve lots of money and they might feel it was worth the risk. In this particular case I did mean the Nigerian players, but I also mean generally. For example, the Pakistani cricket players who were caught match-fixing must have known the dangers of being caught, but went along with it anyway.

So, in summary, any players from any sport who get involved in match-fixing are likely to know that they're being watched or that the consequences of being caught would be dire, but the money to be made can be enough of a temptation to try it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No matter how many times I see it, I'll never be convinced this was anything but deliberate. A few people have said that he must have been putting pressure on both sides of the ball when he caught it, and when his right hand "slipped", the force of his left hand pushed the ball into the net. But the ball was coming straight at him more or less when he caught it, so most of the force from his hands would be behind the ball. I just don't believe for a second there would be enough force to push the ball in at that speed when his right hand did move without him actually chucking it in. 

I showed this to a friend of mine who abhors football and he burst out laughing when he saw it! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm with you mate, I can't see how anyone would see this as anything other than blatantly intentional. Yes a player jumps into him, but the ball was coming straight at him at the time of him catching it. I just refuse to believe there was enough contact, or the keeper was exerting enough pressure on the ball from one side, to cause that to happen! He's lobbed it! </TEXT>

 With a favourable draw, an impressive squad supporting him, and without Diego Maradona being behaviourally barmy and tactically unhinged in the dugout, the stage is set for one of the greatest footballers of all time to retake the lead in his personal World Cup goalscoring head-to-head against Brighton's Matthew Upson, which currently stands tantalisingly poised at 1-1. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was just wondering if there's any decks you play against that give you that bit more satisfaction winning against than other decks.

I have a Sanguine Bond + Crypt Incursion deck which I've used to pretty good effect, but the deck I love to beat more than others with it is the U/B mill deck. I just played someone who was playing Jace, as well as Phenax, and in two turns he managed to mill me to about 12 cards left, and the whole time I was just sitting grinning as he fed my win condition. (I play online, so I don't need to play with a poker face!)

Casting the crypt incursion right at the death was highly satisfying :D

What are yours? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I know there's been a recent thread about someone who took hours to complete a mission, only to have "hostiles killed:1" at the end, and I'm having a similar problem in The Surge level of the Knife of Dunwall DLC.

My question is - what kind of things can cause hostiles to be killed after you've knocked them out?

I know rats can eat them, so I always stash bodies off the floor.
I also know that falling from a height can kill them, so I always try to do a choke and carry.

What other ways can it happen? I got yet another single hostile killed in that level, even though I made sure no-one fell, and the bodies were out of the reach of rats (which I killed as well just to be sure!). </TEXT>

I've been having massive problems with Silverlight recently, getting that 2103 error code and not being able to fix it no matter what steps I take.  I noticed in the playback settings there's a choice for HTML5 over Silverlight, which I've ticked, but when I try to watch something it tells me I need to download Silverlight first!

Is HTML5 playback only available on Windows 8, or am I missing something somewhere?

Would really appreciate any help, it's very frustrating :( </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think one of the biggest obstacles Liverpool could face next year is that Man City would have to be dreadfully unlucky to have Toure, Kompany, Aguero and Silva all injured for the same amount of time they did this year. Wasn't there some stat that they'd only played 216 minutes together? If City can keep them fit next year, and they'll more than likely add a couple more players, things will be very tough for Liverpool, especially with them in Europe again, which requires the squad to be used to its fullest. They'll still be challenging though, regardless. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Your second point is the reason these titles rile me so much. Don't try and sway my opinion before I've even read something with some manipulative crap. I'll form my own opinion as to whether or not I'm 'blown away' etc., which, nine times out of ten, I'm not!

Is Mignolet slightly at fault for the first goal? (as well as the defence obviously) I can't believe he's left such a big gap to his right.

Liverpool's goal was a cracker, gorgeous pass to Johnson. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Not sure which version to buy - vanilla, survival or GOTY </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-03-12 20:19:52 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi everyone, Tomb Raider is on sale in Steam at the moment and I'm definitely going to snap it up, but was wondering what the different versions include (well just surviuval and GOTY because vanilla is obvious!).

The reason I ask is because I bought Dead Space 2 GOTY and wish I hadn't because I hate the way that some of the DLC gives you better equipment earlier than you would normally get it, and I want to avoid that if I can with TR.

Does survival just add extra multiplayer maps, or does it include some equipment as well?

Would be very grateful for any info! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I really want to be excited for this film, but after seeing this trailer I just can't be. I think it looks like it's just going to be yet another in a long line of bad-average movies that lean far too heavily on the CGI aspect, at the expense of everything else (King Kong, Transformers, Avatar etc.). I really hope they prove me wrong! But the cgi at 0.45, and 1.09 just makes me cringe :( </TEXT>

To be honest, I feel like I'm ploughing a bit of a lone furrow there at the moment, so it would be great to see people over there and posting some stuff :)

	<TEXT> Thanks for the video, mate. When I watched the gif it made me wonder why she made that shot in the first place. I couldn't understand how she'd managed to judge the flight of the ball so badly that she had to hit the ball behind her own back! But that clip clears it all up :) (For anyone who can't see the clip for whatever reason, the ball hits the net on the way through, significantly changing the trajectory of the ball) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't remember the quote exactly that's my favourite, but it's when Kelly and Bud are both going to bed.

Al: Kids, have I ever told you how much I love you?

Both: No Daddy.

	<TEXT> This is one of these things I'd need to get done to me to believe it actually works (please note, this is not me saying it doesn't work). Surely to goodness you'd recognise that the person you were talking to literally seconds before has completely changed? 

One of the things that makes me think this particular clip is staged is because when the girl bends down and gets the phone, she starts turning her head while the other guy is still there. Surely she'd see him in her peripheral vision from there? </TEXT>
