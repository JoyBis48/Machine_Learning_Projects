	<TEXT> It's really helpful connecting you to other people who are going through the same things :)
Youtube especially really helped me come to terms with who I am. I know I'm not really all the way there yet but I'm so much happier than I was three years ago, when I first came out to myself. I'm with a woman a love and I have really supportive friends and family. That's all I ever wanted :) </TEXT>
